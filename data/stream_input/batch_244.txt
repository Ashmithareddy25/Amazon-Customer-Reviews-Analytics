B00000JCOV|5.0|That's right! Slipknot is the best band to create to die for speedmetal since Metallica. They will be looked on as legends in no time at all. I don't even care about the costumes and the masks, although they do add a unique flavor. When I hear these guys play, I am touched by an emotion I've not felt from hardcore metal in awhile. It's hard to put a label on it, we'll just call it original. Most metal has become so repetitive lately, nobody is doing anything different anymore, but now Slipknot has surfaced and become what I like to call the Led Zeppelin of speedmetal. I've never heard anything like it before, particularly on this debut album, they will probably never top it. I am not going to evaluate each song one by one, they are all worthy of being absolutely worshipped, if you don't give this band a chance, you are simply missing out on the best thing going on in music today. Years ago speedmetal was written off as noisy crap, except for Metallica, there are people who worship Barry Manilow who admire Metallica's work, well, Slipknot weaves their metal into a fine art as well, and soon they will earn the attention of all music listeners as well, just my opinion. The \\"Slipknot\\" debut album along with its follow-up \\"Iowa\\" are truly new classics, and the best thing to happen to metal since Metallica fell short by releasing their \\"black\\" album. Look for Slipknot to be the most acknowledged metal band in the world in the near future.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I saw this movie for two reasons. I didn't think I would have to tolerate car chases and bomb blasts for two hours and the film, to be sure, relies on neither. However, I can't help but wonder why people are calling this a great movie. Although I like Mr. Crowe as an actor, his work in this film seems overly self conscious and his accent wears on you by the end of the film. The one bright star is the female lead. She is a wonderful actress and I hope to see more from her. If you want to see a truly great film get \\"Remains of the Day\\". Hopkings and Thompson define great acting in this film.....

B00005JLDW|4.0|First of all, my actual rating of this movie is 3.5 stars, but since I can't rate using fractions of a star I decided to be generous.<br />\\"Reign of Fire\\" starts with a young boy named Quinn going to visit his mother in the English mine where she works.  He wanders over to where one of her co-workers has encountered a problem, and the man sends him into the hole he has dug.  Inside, Quinn discovers a gigantic dragon that unleashes its fire on the mine, leaving a wake of destruction.<br />Twenty years or so later, Quinn (Christian Bale) find himself the leader of a colony of survivors that have managed to evade the dragons and to survive the nuclear winter caused by humanity's attempts to destroy the dragons.  Enter Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), an American soldier with a mission to kill all dragons.  Fate teams the unlikely pair together, and with the help of helicopter pilot Alex (Izabella Scorupco), they go on a quest to save the world.<br />I found \\"Reign of Fire\\" to be somewhat of a disappointment in terms of plot.  I was hoping for a lot more.  The premise of the dragons-rule-the-world concept was cool and convincing in a fantasical sort of way, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie.  From there, the plot sort of when downhill.  It didn't flow smoothly, and I found the climax to be the greatest disappointment of all.  It just seemed too easy at the end.  The acting was more than adequate, but it just couldn't save the flimsy plot.<br />However, the special effects were great (which is why I gave this 3.5 stars).  The dragons were very realistic: they flew naturally and breathed fire just the way you would expect a dragon to.  Even the dead dragons looked real.  My one request would be that the dragons be given more screen time.<br />Bottom Line:  Awesome dragons, not much story.  Only go if you like dragons, Christian Bale, or action movies.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|My love for Rage Against the Machine started with, like most people, their self-titled album. I still hold that album up as one of my favorites and I still listen to it on a regular basis. Their follow up to that, Evil Empire, was pretty much a dumbed down, carbon-copy of it's predecessor which I really didn't enjoy. With their third release, RATM give their best effort since their first album. The music on here is a bit more challenging than that on Evil Empire. Tom Morello proves how great of a guitarist he is and how unique his stylings are on this CD. However, the downfall of this CD is the fact that this was made seven years after their first album, and Rage Against the Machine are still stuck in the same place they were seven years prior. Nothing has changed. Still \\"raging\\" about the same things, and is it just me, or does EVERY song on this CD sound the same? This CD to me shows exactly how RATM ran themselves into the ground so far that it forced frontman Zack out of the band. Seven years is a long time to not make any progress. Although when compared to other albums by other bands this CD looks like a stroke of genius, this album is still very weak coming from a band that I know has talent in them. This CD has a few good tracks on it, my personal favorites being Mic Check (which helps break the monotony), Ashes in the Fall and the radio-hit Guerrilla Radio. I look forward to the Chris Cornell/RATM project (if it is ever released, since Chris dropped out). I don't have much left to say now, but I just recommend you realize what you're getting into with this CD. If you already own their first CD, don't expect to be blown away.
6305499365|5.0|I stumbled across this comic takeoff on the office world of cubicles and idiotic bosses when surfing idly through the channels one night and was delighted to find it a very funny if farfetched frolic with a relatively unknown leading man, Ron Livingston.  (Livingston is better known now since his star turn in \\"Band of Brothers\\", the highly praised WW II HBO miniseries).  The only member of the cast likely to be familiar to virtually every viewer is Jennifer Aniston, in a relatively small but likeable role as Livingston's new girlfriend.  The other cast members are all very good, especially Gary Cole as the obnoxious boss, but none is well known, which may be one of the reasons this comedy is so charming.  At any rate, this tale of the hypnosis-inspired  revolt of one of the cyber-drones in a maddeningly supervised office is very funny and utilizes the talents of its not-well-known actors with great effectiveness.  I am told that the film has become something of a cult favorite among those who toil in the computer/tech world, with good reason.
B000002R48|4.0|This freshman effort from Dream Theater is awesome.  You can really hear where the riffs and style came from that were integrated into DT's later efforts.  Overall, to the non-DT fan this will sound like a really tight garage/bar band that was on it's way to the top...I personally loved all it had to offer.<br />For the newbie to DT, do NOT get this unless you are into collecting prog rock from this time period onward (1989).  Otherwise, this CD is one great slice of history, as well as a gem for all DT fans.  It will sound like a Queensryche or Rush CD a lot at times, but the intensity of the Portnoy/Petrucci was set in place with this one - and the rest that followed was the history of Dream Theater.  One only has to get SFAM or their latest to see the progression of these master of progressive rock.<br />My only disappointment is the production - Rush 2112 sounded better to me, and that was done 15 years earlier - shame on Terry Date!  I am sure that the talent was there, but the money just wasn't...Either way, this CD is great and one that no DT fan should be without!!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a great cd. Though honestly i find myself just putting in the cd and listening to Aqueous Transmission over and over again:) It is such a beautiful song and different from the other incubus songs. It's actually why i bought the cd in the first place. In conclusion, it's worth buying the cd just for that song. But no worries, because the rest of the cd is good too.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie was beautiful,sad,romantic and in one.I loved the fact that she did helpfeul quests for people like once,in her apartment, she found a old box filled with sport pictures and toys that a young boy would play with from the 50's,Amelie set a quest to find the owner of these toys when she found him,the man realized his childhood in a box and started to cry.
B00005JLDW|1.0|Let's just say, if you've seen Waterworld, you've seen Reign of Fire.  Almost identical in the apocalyptic aftermath of a catsastrophic event and trying to right the wrong.  This movie was slow and uninteresting.  And even the dragons, which I thought could have possibly saved this movie, can't.  They have so many holes in their wings, how the Hell can they fly?  What would have made this movie better would have been if it had taken place in the PROCESS of the destruction.  That would have been a much better movie with much more action.  Maybe that's just my take on it.  Anyway, this movie is terrible and I wouldn't reccommend it to my worst enemy.
0441009425|5.0|Very reminiscent of Iain Banks.  Epic sci-fi at it's best
B000002L9J|5.0|You will dig this album. As far as solid Smiths go -- this is it. Stands up well 15+ years after its release.
1587990717|5.0|The author explains in convincing arguments that we overstate causality; he provides clear examples to prove his point. It does not mean that everything is random, only that we err by underestimating chance. He convincingly shows that 1) chance is much more prevalent that we tend to think, 2) that we are genetically led to underestimate its role, 3) That even scientists tend to be fooled by randomness because of their use of Normal-Gauss curves.<BR>This book will ruffling a lot of feathers, particularly among economics academics and City hotshots. History seems to be proving him right.
1573301183|2.0|This DVD was not what I expected from a Group like Alice in Chains. For one, the best sounding song seemed to be NO EXCUSES. <BR>(I copied this version on to CD) When I first played the DVD I enjoyed the Instruments very much. I, my self, am a BASS player and could appreciate the bass playing as well as the rest of the instruments.<br />    What I believe hurt this concert the most, unfortunately, was Layne Staley's performance as a singer. When I listen to Layne on CD(especially DIRT), I am at awe with the skill he seems to possess in his vocals. On this DVD he seems as though he puts no effort, but i feel as though he really had, but due to<BR>Drug use and not playing in concert together for 3 years may have faultered his.<br />    The only other song that I would say sounds pretty good is WOULD?.Again, if you want to purchase this DVD for Instrumental reasons then the sound is excellent. If purchasing this DVD for Songs as a whole or to hear the powerful voice of Layne Staley then I can not recommend this DVD.<BR> <BR>!!I, in no way choose any band over another due to fashion. I enjoy any music that sounds good.Alice in chains is Incredible but just not in this DVD!!
0385505833|4.0|As an avid Grisham reader, I was skeptical about this book at first. However, I found it a quick, light read and thoroughly enjoyed the change of pace.  It was quite on the mark and puts Christmas in the right place - the heart, not the mall.  Nice little book - even if in the summer.
079070546X|4.0|We have spent many a Christmas with the Griswolds and never tire of their hilarious antics!  Our  favotite parts are &quot;The Icicle Scene&quot; and &quot;The Squirrel Scene&quot;.  And that poor kitty cat!  This movie is fun for the whole family but be aware there is some adult humor that may not be too appropriate for younger kids. It's just not Christmas without the Griswolds!
B000005JAX|3.0|Summarized in a sentence I would perhaps call it solid proof that Martin Gore is nothing without the other members of Depeche Mode.  Don't get me wrong, I love the first song on this album and I am glad to own it for that song.  But, the rest leave a lot to be desired with their cheezy melodies, and bad drum work.  A disappointment, especially seeing as how this album was released so close to DM's excellent album, Violator.  Die hard DM fans - get it, but get the other DM albums first.
B000007UFO|5.0|My two cents worth: I still think this album is gorgeous and brilliant. At its time--I was about 13 years old back then--it just exuded a most exotic, weird European coolness. The songs weave an oceanic, spacey blend of guitar jangle, ambient synths, and dance-able disco rhythm. If you dig Bowie and Roxy Music or Eno, you might like it. There isn't one stinker on this album.<br />Their previous albums have many gems, but were often darker. The next album after New Gold Dream was really good too: Sparkle in the Rain. But suddenly, as if they had been poisoned by bad taste or sold their souls, they became as ...annoying as any bad 80s band. That awful Breakfast Club song brought them fame and trashed their sound (they did not even write it; the Hollywood boogers did). Jim Kerr became a hokey, ...and every song had to be a political statement.<br />Then also lost Derek Forbes, who in my opinion, as a bass guitar player myself, was one of the best musicians of his time.<br />Get New Gold Dream, Sparkle in the Rain, and anything before it. Stay away from Alive and Kicking and the 90s stuff unless you like Mr. Mister ...
0316666343|3.0|I was anxious to read this book because of all the hype surrounding it.  I read this in an evening (I average about a book a day) and was disappointed.  I have read that this is destined to be a classic like \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" which is my favorite book of all time.  Uh, sorry, I don't see this being required reading at high schools.  The book is very well-written, the descriptions are beautiful and some of the passages are heartbreaking.  It is a bit weird, especially toward the end, with the narrator being dead and the very quick passage of time.  It is a touching story and I found myself getting a bit choked up but this is not a book I will read over and over again and or even probably think about a week from now.  Please read this and enjoy it, but don't fall into the trap of this being one of the greatest novels ever written as some people would have you believe.
B00001ODHJ|4.0|Army of Darkness is pretty much just what the title suggests, an over the top send up of those zombie pictures. Significantly different from its predecessors Evil Dead 1 and 2, Army of Darkness lacks the comic gore and genuinely frightening moments of the first two, but makes up for it in the sheer hilarity of Ash's classic one liners and the skeleton animation. the story picks up exactly where Evild Dead II ended, with our hero Ash stranded in medieval England. Once again, he must battle the forces of the dead and recover the necronomicon (the book of the dead), with the help of his chainsaw hand and 'boomstick'.<BR>The transformation of the character Ash from the timid teen in Evil Dead I to the chainsaw wielding badass in Army of Darkness is great to see. Bruce Campbell is probably the only actor who could have pulled off the role of Ash with aplomb and style. His macho grace and rugged \\"good looks\\" truly carry the film. Watch for Embeth Davidtz (she of \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Bridget jones' Diary\\") as Ash's medieval amour who doesn't quite grasp the concept of pillow talk.  You need to see Evil Dead II to fully appreciate Army of Darkness, but can skip Evil Dead I. Rent this film, watch it with friends, and you'll be quoting the one liners forever.
0780021150|5.0|A previous poster incorrectly states that any comparison with Nazis in reference to M is wrong, as the Nazis did not come to power until 1933. (He rather snottily makes reference to those who might take issue with him as \\"historically challenged.\\") <br />The Nazi party was created in 1919 -- basically the German Workers' Party was renamed the Nazi party by Hitler at this time. M premiered in 1931. It's quite clear that Lang is drawing allusions to the troubling and controversial rise of the Nazis a political force preying on the fears of Weimar Germans. A pity that the film was later used by Goebbels to illustrate the \\"evils of the Jews,\\" implying that Jews, like Lorre, were prone to be evil child-molesters...
B00002R0MC|5.0|One of the best collections put together, up there with the Miles davis and John Coltrane Complete Columbia Recordings (if you dont have, GET IT!!!!).

B000065U1N|5.0|Very exciting, realistic, made you get into the story
B00005QG9J|5.0|This was the first cd that I had gotten of Incubus, and instantly I became a fan. I like every song on this cd, because unlike other alternative rock, their music actually has meaning to it. Here is a song review:<br />1. Nice to Know You- A good song to begin the album with, it really gets you in the mood to listen to some heavy music, and yet has a sort of dreaminess to it. 10 of 10<br />2. Circles- This song is another song that keeps you in that angry music mood. My favorite part of this song is when everything gets quiet and the guitar starts up again. 9 0f 10<br />3. Wish you were Here- This is the song that introduced me to Incubus! It is a great song, it is pretty soft compared to the previous two, but trust me you will love this song! 10 of 10<br />4. Just A Phase- This song is my favorite song on the whole cd. It is really dreamy and just a beautiful song. Great vocals in this song, and it maintains that mood of the guitar. I love the lyrics in this song! 10 0f 10<br />5. 11 a.m-  Another pretty dreamy song, with a note of anger to it. I really liked the guitar playing in this song, especially in the beginning of the song. 10 of 10<br />6. Blood on the Ground- Definitely an angry song, great beginning and awesome lyrics! 10 0f 10 <br />7. Mexico- This is the second softest song on the cd, I really liked the background music a lot. If you listen carefully it is a pretty depressing song. 10 0f 10<br />8. Warning- This song is ok, a lot of people told me next to Wish you Were Here, it was the best, but I didn't think it was that excellent. Has a pretty good story said in the song. 9 0f 10<br />9. Echo- Pretty soft, I like this song very much. The background music is excellent. 10 of 10<br />10. Have You Ever- An excellent angry song. The background music is great and so are the vocals. 10 0f 10<br />11. Are you in?- A pretty fun song. It is pretty light and enjoyable. 10 0f 10<br />12. Under my umbrella- My favorite angry song. A lot of yelling and hard background music. Great song. 10 of 10<br />13. Aqueous Transmission-  This is the softest song on the entire cd. A very soothing and calminig one. 10 of 10<br />Shortly after getting morning view less then a year ago, my friend also gave me older cds of Incubus. I noticed that Morning View had a lot calmer tracks than the previous ones. I am looking forward to the next cd coming out by Incubus!!!
B00005UK1F|5.0|I received LIGHT OF DAY,DAY OF DARKNESS 72 hours ago and I can't stop listening to it. I always thought that I would resist writting a review of an album because they can be misleading (one man's treasure is another man's junk sorta thing ) but this album is sooo good that if you like Symphonic rock/metal and groups like THERION, WITHIN TEMPTATION, ROYAL HUNT, HAGGARD and similarly inclined musicians, I feel confidant you'll feel as strongly as I do. Keep in mind this album is an epic - sixty continuous glorious minutes and here's the best part, unlike some classic rock sagas such as OPERATION MINDCRIME (which I dearly love) LIGHT OFDAY,DAY OF DARKNESS has no boring weak spots, no filler, it is 100% mind candy.<BR> I've read the other reviews (all of which were 5 stars) and they were pretty much right on, however, I take a slight exception with the person who said that Tchort (the composer and leader of GREEN CARNATION) is talented, which in my opinion, is an understatement, the man is a musical genius! Which leads me to the two reasons I'm writing this review. One-I feel this is such a great piece of work that I should do something to help it be successful and Two-I'm so impressed with this work,the superlative compostion, the amazing arrangement, the wonderful presentation and delivery I'm in awe!<BR>So this is my standing ovation. I hope they get to read this. <BR> THIS MAY BE THE FINEST RECORDING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!<br />UPDATE---Six months have passed since I bought Light of Day. I have purchased at least at least a hundred more CDs and although I've gotten some dandy's, nothing yet has replicated the excitment I felt when hearing Light of Day the first dozen  or two times. I don't play it as much anymore but when I do I turn up the volume, or better yet put on the headphones and enjoy, and yes I still get chills. This is not the type of recording that gets dated. In fact I would not be suprised if this became the next cult classic, the next 'Dark Side of the Moon'.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|I brought this movie because I love Ben Stiller but he has done better.  I was hoping for a LOL movie like Something About Mary.  That movie was very funny.  This movie should have been funny and it just never hit the mark.  There was so much potential I just didn't find it as funny as it could have been.  You should rent it before you but it if you really want to see it.
630469878X|4.0|A special edition of this film is now in the works.It will probably included commentary by the stara and the crew,and documentaries.It is scheduled for a 2003 release.
B000002H97|5.0|metallica is a great band.  this album was my first introduction to them, and i love it.  songs like &quot;nothing else matters&quot;, &quot;the unforgiven&quot;, &quot;holier than thou&quot;, &quot;sad but true&quot;, and &quot;through the never&quot; are true classics.  anyone who listens to good music should own this album.  i think it defines metal.  if you're new to this type of music, this album is a good starting point.  i am very young so i have been forced to catch up on the 30 great years of music previous to my birth.  this album was a turning point for me and i hope this review will help others to step into the light.  it shows the softer side of one of the greatest bands ever, and i believe everyone has a softer side they should express.  this album is well worth the 15 or so dollars you will spend on it.  it is ESSENCIAL.  (i have no idea how to spell that.  dont take it out on metallica though, they are great.  just pretend i spelled it right.)  ESSENTIAL ESSENSHUL ESENCIAL!
B000066NW0|5.0|Love this CD .. love this girl. The talent is UNREAL ... listen for yourself.. you'll love it!!!!!!!!!!
0062502182|5.0|This is a profoundly insightful book.<BR>It has given me a renewed sense of purpose<BR>and enthusiasm to fulfill my own &quot;PERSONAL LEGEND&quot;.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|This movie is pretty bad.  The timing and development are poor and sluggish, leaving you thinking you are watching the work product of some high-school final project.  Will Farrell, of course, is never funny.  As in every other role he has had, he just dresses oddly and thinks that is comedy.  Zzzz.....  I shut it off after 45 minutes.
B000002J23|4.0|For years, 22 approximately, I refused to listen to this music. A strict Yes dogmatic, I knew the band ended in 1978 with Tormato and that was that.  But, out of curiousity, I finally listened to Drama, and I must say that it's better than I imagined. No, Trevor Horn is not Jon Anderson, but he does a creditable job singing these lyrics.<br />The core members of Yes, Howe, Squire and White are playing better on Drama than they did on the previous two Yes Albums, almost as if they had something to prove.  Geoff Downes's keyboard work is worthwhile too, if only for it's embellishment of the songs, rather than as yet another solo on top of Howe's playing, as our dear Rick was apt to do.<br />Those of you who don't think much of Trevor Horn, think about his position at little. He had a lot guts to do what he did when he did it.<br />So I forgive Yes.  I repent.  This is good music, recognizably Yes (more so than 90125)and suitable for inclusion in the canon.
B00003CXI1|2.0|it wasnt so great it was boring and it stinks as much as the merchandise
0783225210|2.0|&quot;1941&quot; is a complete mess with a whole lot of unfunny forced jokes and an awful screenplay (by Robert Zemeckis and John Milus).  It's clear that Spielberg is a talented filmmaker who doesn't quite have the knack for choosing good scripts.  While nearly everything he did before this was gold (including &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;)... he was obviously at a loss for how to handle a slapstick comedy.  That said, his talent does shine through in a lot of scenes.  There's a pretty fun dance number, the special effects for the plane chase through Hollywood haven't dated a bit, and how can anyone resist a movie that pairs up Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee?  Maybe the casting of Mifune wasn't such a good choice, because I couldn't root against him, even while he was plotting to blow up Hollywood.  I just couldn't!
0800141660|5.0|What more could I say about this movie that hasn't been said.  It's the kind of movie you watch when you're feeling down.  It's a pick-me-up movie.  Spectacular settings, performers and acting.  Love that Emma Thompson.  Kate Winslet is adorable.  Would love Alan Rickman with a bag over his head.  I highly recommend this movie to all Jane Austen fans and lovers of period pieces.
B00005RYLE|1.0|I have something to warn all purchasers of \\"The Evil Dead: Book Of The Dead\\" DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment:<br />THIS MOVIE WAS SHOT IN THE RATIO OF 1.33:1, WHICH IS FULL-FRAME TO FIT YOUR SCREEN. ANCHOR BAY SLAPPED 1.85:1 RATIO BARS OVER (I repeat, OVER) THE FULL-FRAME FILM!! IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, WATCH THE ELITE ENTERTAINMENT DVD VERSION OF EVIL DEAD. YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW BIG TIME COMPANIES WILL FOOL THE PUBLIC BY PRESENTING FULL-FRAME FILMS IN \\"WIDESCREEN\\" COVERING UP THE PICTURE!!<br />BUYER BEWARE!!
B000002N2P|5.0|Yeah, you heard me.  UNDERRATED.  I remember when this album came out, so many people were going, \\"Ugh, this stinks!\\" or \\"They've lost it!\\"  What?!  I thought this album was great!  It's just as good as \\"Dookie,\\" if not more.  Green Day remains one of the coolest bands ever, especially when they perform live.<br />\\"Insomniac\\" is a great album that sill contains the punk edge that made them famous in \\"Dookie.\\"  (Great CD cover!!!  You could look at it unfolded for hours, man.)  EVERY song is great on this album.  Yep.  EVERY song.  The lyrics are great, the guitars are great, and yes, the drumming is great.<br />My favorite songs are as follows: \\"brat,\\" \\"stuck with me,\\" \\"geek stink breath,\\" \\"86,\\" \\"stuart and the ave.,\\" \\"panic song,\\" and \\"walking contradiction.\\"  I really do like ALL of the songs, but those are the ones I listen to the most.<br />I really like the lyrics and the singing best of all.  Billie Joe has an awesome voice, and a great ability of creating great and catchy lyrics.<br />Overall, a great album.  Haven't gotten tire of it yet.  And I don't think I ever will.  Especially after seeing them live for the first time, I dig them more than ever before.  Green Day is a very talented band that deserves more respect.  Even today, yes TODAY, they still rock.  And, they're still together after all of these years.  Pick up \\"Insomniac\\" as soon as you can.
B00003W8NM|5.0|the reviewer wfparish (sorry if i spelled that incorrectly) hit the nail right on thehead, quite possibly the greatest aspect of this movie is that it WILL make you think, make you question how you live, and quetion the benefits of society, especially the one in which we live. That, i think, is one of the reasons why so many people don't like this movie. Many people don't like to have their beliefs challenged, which this movie wil do. Also, so many people are shocked by the violence in here, but throughout the enitre movie *one* person dies. These same people sat through the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan where dozens to hundreds of people were brutally killed without complaining. The violence just comes in a different context, which is entirely justified in terms of the movie.<br />  The men who go to fight club, go for a reason. They go, knowing that they WILL get beaten up. But they also go, and this is the motivating factor, to FEEL. They live their lives feeling nothing, just doing the same *meaningless* stuff day after day. They ae searching for something, for happiness ultimately, and the path society tells them to take to be happy isn't working. Fight club provides them with raw emotion, and they take this to be happiness. As Fight Club spirals out of control and into Project Mayhem, we see the consequences of the path the protagonst took to escape the *evils* of society. Is the path he took the only possible path? no. And that's another complaint many have. Norton's character didn't have to do what he did, go through everything he went through, and thus could have saved many people a lot of pain. But my answer is that he DID have to do what he did. He even said himself that he did not know how to change the live he was leading, he only knew that he was sick of it, as so many people are (which is why so many people joined him in his cause). What he did wasn't ncessairily RIGHT, but the question you should ask yourself is this. Is what he did, and what he became ultimately, better than the life he would have led if he would've remained in his little cubicle? The answr may surprse you. i think the main idea this movie tries to instill in you is that you should not blindly follow.<br />  The movie attacks corporate America, sayng that people are *wasting* their lives away in cublicles. It attacks the media, and their attempts (quite often successful) to make us conform. After looking at a Calvin Klein ad of a muscular man in underwear, Pitt as Tyler Durden says, \\"Self improvement is masturbation. Self destruction, might be the answer.\\" whether or not you see this as true,is up to you and you alone. I'm not even going to state my opinion, because it doesnt matter. what matters is that you see this movie, which is unbelivable. And don't let this review make you think that you'll be bored out of you mind. i just tried to delve deeper into what the movie is trying to say. It is extremely entertaining, David Fincher has yet again done a tremendous job, and David Uhls brought the book to the screen splendidly, retaining much of the comedy that lightens an otherwise rather dark movie. Ed Norton, and Brad Pitt both give amazing performances, as does Helena Bonham Carter. The DVD itself comes packed extremely well, complete with a pamphlet entitled \\"how to start a fight\\" that has many of hollywood's opinions on the movie, and the story of how it came to be made. In short, you should defintely watch this movie *at least* once, no matter who you are. ...<br />Very Highly Recommendede became ultimately, better than the life he would have led if he would've remained in his little cubicle?

B000067CPX|5.0|Alright.  First off, this is another AMAZING RHCP CD.  It is a little too much like Californication (softer, and less funk than I like), but that's okay.  This is a new sound from the Peppers while mixing all previous record sounds.<br />Overall, I find this CD better than Freaky Style (their first CD), Mother's Milk (2nd CD), and One Hot Minute (4th CD), but find Californication (2nd newest CD) and Blood Sugar Sex Majik (3rd CD, AND BEST) to be better.  Anywho, on sale at ... for ($) and well worth every penny.
0930289455|2.0|Please don't call me a \\"wimp,\\" but I am tired of the current trend in comicdom to turn Batman (and his enemies) into sympathetic and oh-so-neurotic souls. The Joker, while always a fruitcake, gets a makeover here, and is revealed to once have been a family man. OK, so what? Is that supposed to elicit a tear from the reader?<br />Then, in the same story, he commits a crime so heinous to both Commissioner Gordon and daughter Barbara that the empathy one may have had for the fiend evaporates almost as soon as it appeared.<br />Mind you, I don't like the non-Tim Burton-directed movie versions, either. And the 60's high camp of Adam West's series didn't add much.<br />Only did the 90's animated version get the characters correctly.<br />I, honestly, didn't find the \\"joke\\" worthy of my expenditure.<br />Obviously, the majority of others represented here have different opinions...but, to each his own.
B000066AXC|5.0|We cannot say enough about what an incridible job Mr. Howard and company did on this very \\"moving and inspirational\\" film.  The acting, led brilliantly by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly is convincing (you could really believe they were a couple).  The story is compelling and well written.  This is truly a film for the intelligent, sophisticated viewer, rather than the movie goers who prefer slasher/fantasy teen-type films.  If this film does not capture your heart, then perhaps you should check and make sure you actually have a heart (Ha!).  Seriously, this is the most outstanding film we have ever seen which deals with mental illness.  As for the \\"reality issue\\" that so many continue to criticize: How many times does Mr. Howard have to say \\"this is BASED on true story\\" and is not a documentary nor a 100% factual account. O.K?<br />It's a travesty (to say the least) that Russell Crowe was intentionally snubbed by the Academy for being out-spoken.    Movie-goers all over the world  are confused as to why this magnificant film was rewarded for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, and even Best Supporting Actress, while ignoring the Lead Actor???  At least the folks over at the Golden Globes, SAG Awards and Critics Choice were able to put their personal biases aside and vote appropriately.   For anyone who does not believe that racial politics played a role in Russell's Academy snub, I've got some prime property in the flooded area of Texas for sale.  Denzel probably should have won for The Hurricane.  Russell should have won for Beautiful Mind.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Pearl Harbor is an amazing movie, with all of the great graphics and a wonderful love story mixed in. I have never cried so hard when watching this movie! I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, because many people need to know how horrible this situation was. Before this movie, I barely gave a thought to this historical moment. Now, I want to watch this movie over and over again because it was so well put together and has such a great plot.
B0000017CA|5.0|I just got this cd and I cant beleive how outstanding it is. This one just jumped into my top five of all time. I own a lot of metal cd's and these guy's should have been just as big as tool,slipknot, mudvayne and even metallica. If you don't by this album, take everything you own and throw it away because you are just fooling yourself.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is definitely among the top 10 records of the 1990s, if not the top three. I personally prefer it to Nevermind, and rank it about on par with Ten, Superunknown, and Siamese Dream. The thing that stands out about these records, along with the outstanding music and lyrics, is their originality. Most of the early and mid-90s rock bands had their own unique style, and each was good in its own way (with the questionable exception of STP, who did seem to simply blend Pearl Jam and AIC's styles). Ten years later in the early '00s, the vast majority of today's bands are less inspired and original, and sound much like one another. I still enjoy listening to many late 90s bands, but it seems like things have gone even more downhill since then... for example, Nickelback and Default getting ANY airplay seems like a bad sign. They have no style and their music and lyrics are just not comparable to records like Dirt. At least we still have Tool and Pearl Jam, the only surviving good early 90s bands (STP may still be 'alive' but they have completely sold out with La-Dee-Da).<br />I guess I focused a lot on the general music scene above, so I'll try to highlight the good points of this CD in particular. My favorite tracks are \\"Them Bones,\\" \\"Rain When I Die,\\" \\"Rooster\\" (of course), and \\"Would?\\". Nearly as good are \\"Dam That River,\\" \\"Down In a Hole,\\" and \\"Angry Chair.\\" The remaining tracks are still excellent and eons better than 3 Doors Down or Default.<br />If you are just getting into rock music and consider Earshot, Default, Nickelback, etc. to be groundbreaking bands, you owe it to yourself to check out this incredible record, along with the other 90s \\"big dogs\\" -- those being Pearl Jam's \\"Ten,\\" Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown,\\" Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" and STP's \\"Core.\\"
0446608955|5.0|This book and the movie were great! My friend Erika saw the movie before me and she said it made her smile and feel like crying. She loved it so I just HAD to see the movie myself. It was great. I loved it, but before I even watched the movie I got the book and read it so that I could have both!
0385491026|4.0|&quot;Cat's Eye&quot; is a tale about Elaine Risley, her childhood memories, her relationships, her accomplishments.<br />The book frankly explores topics like North American society's cultural expectancies, cruelty that exists among children, distorted perceptions of love, and the permanence of experience. As Elaine reflects on her life, the reader discovers that human beings have a persistent nature to strive for social acceptance.<br />The prose is a little choppy at times, but that is only Atwood's trademark. When I finished reading &quot;Cat's Eye&quot;, I had a huge question mark hovering above my head. &quot;Huh? That's it?&quot; I had wondered. But upon further reflection, I realized that something must have motivated me to finish the book -- it was the blunt reality, the uncensored honesty, and the cold truths that made this book so captivating.

B00004XPOZ|5.0|STAR WARS<br />  EPISODE IV, V, & VI:  TIMELESS CLASSICS<br />It was history in the making in the world of Hollywood, before<br />George Lucas went over to the Dark Side with the prequels.  In<br />1977, Lucas created Star Wars Episode IV-A New Hope, little<br />expecting that this movie would go to box-office light-speed and<br />gain him a name in cinema history.  This was the saga of an<br />idealistic farmboy named Luke Skywalker, son of a fallen Jedi<br />Knight, and his quest to seek out not only a princess but his<br />own destiny.  Luke, Obi-Wan Kenobi, two droids, the squat but<br />very versatile R2-D2 and the cowardly Tin Man, C-3PO, Corellian<br />space pirate Han Solo and the Wookiee Chewbacca immortalized<br />themselves in the psyches of Boomer and Generation-X'ers.  The<br />Mos Eisley Cantina, with its plethora of exotic creatures, the<br />desert world of Tatooine, the moon-sized planet-destroying Death<br />Star of Grand Moff Tarkin, the rickety saucer-shaped Millennium<br />Falcon, and dogfights between X-Wings and Tie Fighters set the<br />standard for science fiction films thereafter.  Viewers would<br />also meet Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, who would<br />symbolize the evil that was the Galactic Empire.  Menacing in<br />his skull-like helmet, armour, black cloak, and his ominous<br />breathing apparatus, Darth Vader became my favorite Star Wars<br />character.<br />Indeed, he gained prominence in The Empire Strikes Back, the<br />best of the trilogy, featuring Snow Walkers, asteroid fields,<br />some hot-shot flying by Han Solo, cities in the clouds, and<br />wizened Jedi Masters from whom we learned that \\"luminous beings<br />are we, not this crude matter.\\"  Yoda demonstrated the triumph<br />of the human will when he levitated Luke's X-wing from the<br />swamps of Dagobah.  Luke's harrowing adventure in the cave was a<br />clue to what he would learn later.  Empire featured the proper<br />debut of the bounty hunter Boba Fett, whose armoured array of<br />weaponry, cunning, and guile served the Empire well.  A pity the<br />other bounty hunters were seen all too briefly.<br />The trilogy wrapped up in Return Of The Jedi, where Luke, Lando,<br />Princess Leia went to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, then<br />prepare in time for the climactic battle against the Empire and<br />Death Star Mark II, and a shot at getting Emperor Palpatine<br />himself.  Luke learned the truth about his father and readied<br />himself for the confrontation with Vader and the Emperor.  The<br />monsters at Jabba's palace exceeded the cantina scenes, with<br />Jabba representing the ultimate in Phil Tippett's creations.<br />However, I do prefer the original Max Rebo music number.  And as<br />for the Ewoks, yes, \\"short help is better than none,\\" and at<br />least the revamped edition did away with their cutesy dance<br />number.  And the space battle was the perfect special effects<br />triumph with just the right excitement, not the numbing digital<br />blast of sound and noise that permeates today's movies.<br />All three of these movies played a formative role in my<br />childhood.  These three videos are the revamped editions, and<br />most of the new scenes add to the original cuts of the movies<br />without ruining them.  It is the triumphant dialogue and<br />appealing characters that make the original trilogy classics in<br />their time.  Who can forget such memorable lines as \\"I felt as<br />if millions of voices had cried out, and were suddenly<br />silenced,\\" \\"Don't you call me a mindless philospher, you<br />overweight blob of grease!\\", \\"Garbage!  What a really wonderful<br />idea!  What an incredible smell you've discovered!\\", \\"Look at<br />the size of that thing!\\"  and \\"He's got to follow his own path,<br />no one can choose it for him.\\"<br />So remember, a Jedi's strength flows in embracing the Good<br />Trilogy, A New Hope, Empire, and Jedi.  But beware the Dark<br />Trilogy--Menace, Clones, andthe one yet to come.  Once you<br />start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your<br />destiny.  So trust your feelings, and may the Force be with you.nd Jedi.  But beware the Dark <br />Trilogy--Menace, Clones, and the one yet to come.  Once you <br />start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your <br />destiny.  So trust your feelings, and may the Force be with you.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I disliked the song  &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;. It was over played and too soft but my sister loved it so she bought the cd. Wow. It's amazing. The vocals are outstanding, the guitars are incredible, and drums were superb. The entire cd(except &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;) was hard core rock. They have great music written about things that most people don't have the guts to sing about. All in all if you like loud, provocative, genuine music this is right for you.
B00003CXI0|3.0|I admit, I watched this movie because of the hype surrounding the nerdy little orphan boy with wizard powers.  Although &quot;Harry Potter&quot; was somewhat engaging, I am uncertain about how much it parallels with the book, and also, who the target audience is.  Some scenes may seem too frightening for younger ones, but the plot itself is a little juvenile for adults.  Some ideas are clever and original, but Rowling instead should be credited.  The movie was not as great as I had expected, and the hype it receives is questionable.  Not bad for rental though.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator definitely deserved to win the Oscar. The film is magnificently put together from beginning to end. The drama and action compliment eachother quite well in this film, which is often hard to find in recent movies. The fight scenes are amazing, but are made even more amazing because of the drama and emotions that flow beneath the action. Russel Crowe is amazing in this film and definitely grabs the audience and brings them into this ancient civilization. Great on DVD as well, sound is impressive as well as the picture.
B00003CXI1|2.0|The fourth HARRY film, (following &quot;The Trouble With Harry Potter,&quot; &quot;When Harry Potter Met Sally,&quot; and the series' high-water-mark, &quot;Dirty Harry Potter&quot;), is a mostly hollow exercise that does little to enliven a once-lucrative franchise.  Smugness and in-your-face special effects are no substitute for interesting characters and genuine inspiration.  Desperate.
B000002AZ8|4.0|So there is a love/hate relationship with me for this one. In one breath it is the CD that gains me the most respect for a band like Pearl Jam and in another breath it just doesn't play all the way through. I itched to give this 3-stars just for stratification's sake of PJ's works, but now with it playing on the headphones, I realize that their musicianship and their statement of \\"Freak off\\" to popularity thus does not allow me to be too critical.<br />Vitalogy was Pearl Jam's coming out album. This may sound unusual since Ten and Vs. gained them mass popularity, but with Vitalogy PJ made a statement that they were willing to undergo popular devolution to gain some of their artistry back. This album was a statement that they are going to do it their way, damn the torpedoes, damn the popular fan base. This one was for them.<br />As such it includes some of PJ's best and worst moments. \\"Not for You\\" and \\"Immortality\\" are some of their finest songs. The first revealing pure bubbling under the surface fury that breaks open to outright disgust. \\"Restless soul, enjoy your youth, like Mohammed, It's the truth, can't escape from the common rule, if you hate something don't you do it too,\\" gives Vedder retelling of the golden rule and a feeling of abhorrence at those that casually break said rule. It's a motto for the album in fact...it's not for you and therein lies its weakness as well.<br />There are too many tracks that are just barely listenable. They are interesting, but don't make for a good playthrough. \\"Bugs\\", \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", \\"Foxymophandlemomma\\", and the anthem to privacy \\"Prye to\\" all begged to be skipped unless you are playing them just to prostrate yourself to Monty Python's maxim...\\"and now for something completely different.\\"<br />If you are a PJ fan, for the sake of knowing and loving the band, don't pass this up. If you aren't, move on to No Code, Yield, or everyone's favorite Ten. \\"A truant finds home, a wish to hold on, but there's a trap door in the sun.\\" Rock on, truants.the sun.\\" Rock on, truants.
B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie Minogue's &quot;Fever&quot; is quite light, catchy, popish-techno music. It kind of reminds me some of Abba's music, perfectly crafted hooks to have you bouncing up and down. There is no depth to this album, so don't really expect to get some out of it. On first listen all the songs sound the same and boring except for the amazing &quot;can't get you out of my head&quot;. But after a couple of listens you'll be able to fall in love with this album. Suggested listens before you buy this would be: Love Affair, In Your Eyes, and of course the single &quot;Can't Get You out of My Head&quot;.
B000002JS6|4.0|Even if you aren't a particularly avid AC/DC fan, it should be acknowledged that &quot;Back in Black&quot; is among the best heavy metal albums ever.  It represents the strongest and most consistent songwriting of the Australian band's career.  The riffs on such tracks as &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; the title track, &quot;Hells Bells&quot; and &quot;Given the Dog a Bone&quot; are irresistable.  This isn't complicated stuff, as evidenced by other songs with names like &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You,&quot; &quot;Have a Drink on Me,&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.&quot;  But the band achieves a sort of simple mastery here that they would never quite reach again.  It is the milestone of their long career and one for heavy metal music in general.
0380820846|4.0|This is my first Julia Quinn book and it won't be my last.  I really enjoyed this book.  Colin and Penelope were endearing characters - friends that turn into lovers.  <br />Poor Penelope has been the ultimate wallflower for the past ten years.  Her coming out was a disaster and things haven't gotten much better since.  Now she's 28 and an &quot;on the shelf spinster&quot;.  She is reacquainted with Colin, the brother of her best friend and the man she has carried a torch for since she was 16.  She quietly adores him while outwardly carrying on a lighthearted friendship with him.  She is realistic enough to accept that there will never be anything else between them.  For Colin is &quot;the most charming man in London&quot;, not to mention handsome, funny and just plain nice.  As she spends more time with Colin, she is surprised to discover that he feels adrift with no real purpose in life.  He wants to be thought of as something more than just &quot;charming&quot;. <br />Colin starts to see something in Penelope that he never recognized before.  The more he is around her, the more he is surprised by her.  She actually berates him for feeling sorry for himself and tells him to stop complaining and do something to change his life.  She's smart, funny, independent, and no longer the frumpy, clumsy, utterly forgettable girl she used to be.  OK, she is still a little clumsy, but now she's a self-posessed woman who is not afraid to speak her mind.  And, Colin discovers much to his alarm, she's not so forgettable.  He finds himself attracted to her, not just mentally but physically!  Wow!<br />I liked that the romance was pretty realistic given who these two people were.  My only quibble is with Penelope's stubborn actions toward the end of the book.  Why mess with a good thing?  But all in all this was a fun, witty enjoyable read.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I loved this movie it is kind of true to the video games to an extent. The film was DEFENATLY under rated. Listen if you don't like it fine, but if you comment about the story, plot, and zombies thing then you're bringing it down. Every movie and video game has something good about it. You have to give things a try or else you might miss out on a great thing... If you know the games it helps to learn about the movie. I say this is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes the resident evil series. I know I will have it in my Movie library and I know I will be constantly watching and letting friends borrow this movie for many years to come.<br />Also I can't wait for the other movies to come out.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is a review of the concert portion of the DVD. I haven't watched the second disc and probably wont, BUT it is truly a BONUS dic, i.e., we're not really charged for it so...<br />Why would YES even tour with orchestra? I don't think they need it because of the talent of the band.  Also I didn't think YES could pull off a world tour with different orchestras at each stop - their music being some long and complicated. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant got it right when they teamed up with folks to take with them. Might have been a little expensive, but the performances were much tighter. I was mainly looking forward to \\"Gates of Delerium\\" And \\"Ritual\\" because they're great songs and \\"Gates\\" is one of my favorites, only being on a few \\"live\\" recordings as well as the Japenese release of the bootleg vid from Queens Park Ranger. Anything else would be \\"gravy\\" so to speak. <br />So, a bit apprehensive, we play the DVD...<br />Wow, gravy galore! Band and orchestra are in sync. Some of the songs are re \\"arranged\\" and the show is a success! Chris Squires bass playing in the highlight of the show! (I won't comment on his clothes!) Granted, Chris is a lead bass player like Geddy Lee and Jack Bruce, but he's on FIRE here! A few bass solos were greatly appreciated by me. \\"Gates\\" is superb! Unreal! Awesome! Ritual was extended by a percussion interlude and sounded great! Both songs were given new live and added enthusiasm, much obliged! (and there was this really cute bird playing cymbols and tympani).<br />The lowlight was the PPP that went into placing the dual layer stop frame right in the crescendo of \\"Starship Trooper\\". After Steve's solo stuff would have been fine.  <br />Was Jon acting like he was on ecstacy (love, love, love? Of course, but we all have our quirks!) Did Steve want ot play on a Trevor Rabin tune, \\"Changes\\"? Nosireebob! (but Chris and Tom Brislin sort of kick him in the... , musically speaking!) Tom Brislin, who played keys for the band, played marvelous for his first tour with the band. Kudos Tom! <br />Overall great disc, great performance, great experience! The is a close as you can get to a \\"Holy Grail\\", i.e., great show, great sound, great mix, great picture! In fact for YES fans, it IS!
B00005NKKV|3.0|&quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; the song is among the best that Simon and Garfunkle ever recorded.  It is folk rock with an edge, in the spirit of Bob Dylan's best work.  The album of the same name, however, is a dicier proposition.  It feels like it was assembled as a launching pad for the song, rather than recorded as a conceptualized whole.  There are other strong points, including the poigniant &quot;Like a Rock,&quot; the suicide lament &quot;Richard Cory&quot; the haunting ballad &quot;April Come She Will&quot; and &quot;A Most Peculiar Man,&quot; which is as engagingly strange as its title.  The rest of the material, however, is spotty, dated, and of lesser interest.<br />Overall, I would recommend this album for Simon and Garfunkle completists only.  Casual fans would be better off with one of their numerous anthology albums, all of which contain the title song.
0446310786|5.0|This book is very, very good.<BR>Thats all i can say.heh heh.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5, not only play incredible music, but are incredible guys. They are totally down to Earth and appreciate their fans. That's why I am shouting it out to ANYONE who will listen, that they need this album in their collection.<br />The songs are beautiful, about relationships... good and bad parts of them. The vocals, the guitars, drums, keyboards... these guys are talented. They have a mix of rock, pop, and funk. I can honestly say I have nothing like this in my CD collection. The lyrics and the music aren't written by 50 year old men with high reputations... but they are written from experience by the band members.<br />Check out Maroon 5, they are definitely the band to keep an eye out for. And if you need more convincing then this review download/listen to the song clips for:<br />Harder To Breathe, She Will be loved, and Tangled. Just to name a few. <br />Maroon 5, you ROCK!
B00005NKKZ|4.0|&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot; was the biggest success of Simon and Garfunkle's career based upon the massively popular song of the same name and a number of other successful hits.  It is also, arguably, the duo's most consistent original studio album.  In addition to the title track, &quot;Cecilia&quot; and &quot;The Boxer&quot; are among their best known songs and &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; also usually shows up on thier Greatest Hits collections.  But beyond those highlights, &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; is one of the prettiest songs they ever recorded and other tracks like &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Baby Driver&quot; are solid album cuts.  The only real duds are the drearily slow &quot;So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; and a surprisingly unengaging cover of the Everly Brothers' &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot;<br />Overall, &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot; is good enough to deservedly be called a classic.
0195117298|1.0|I did not read the entire book.  I don't think I could have gotten through it. I picked it up in a book store and read portions of it. Since this is a book intended for the lay reader this was sufficient to tell me whether the book was worth purchasing.<br />I am not a physicist, just an educated layman.  The book uses a whole bunch of scientific jargon to say nothing. To provide a convincing argument that time is an illusion Barbour must find some alternative way of explaining all those phenomena that we explain using time, like why firecrackers explode after the fuse is lit. He does not do this.<br />I would recommend that anyone intending to buy this book first leaf through it at a library or book store. If it makes sense to you then more power to you. Go and buy it. Otherwise do not waste your time and money.
B000002GB9|4.0|Anchored by the ultimate guilty pleasure song \\"Come Sail Away,\\" (lampooned to such terrific effect by Cartman on \\"South Park\\") \\"The Grand Illusion\\" catapulted Styx to the top of the charts in 1977 just as the punk explosion was making a mockery of everything their bombastic arena rock stood for.  Not that it impeeded them in any way shape or form.  In addition to the aforementioned \\"Come Sail Away,\\" with its truly bizarre reference to spaceships [...], Tommy Shaw turns in the surprisingly poigniant \\"Fooling Yourself,\\" one of his best songs and James Young takes on beauty pagents with \\"Miss America.\\"  The title track is a prototypical Styx song, all bombast and silly lyrics, but darned catchy.  The rest of the material fills the gaps nicely, though the overall \\"concept\\" fails to make a whole lot of sense.<br />Overall, if you're looking to to make your first purchase of one of Styx's original studio albums, I'd start with this one.
B00004XONN|2.0|P.T. Barnum's estimation of a sucker being born every minute is apparently too forgiving for the American record buying public. Considering that Radiohead has proven, in the past, that they're capable of putting together a cohesive album now and again, they're doubtlessly snickering behind closed doors marveling at the gushing praise for \\"Kid A\\".<br />  The inspiration seems to be the daring progressive, often atmospheric, Krautrock of Can and Kraftwerk, but there's not a genuinely inventive or adventurous moment here. Comparisons can be made to a Jackson Pollock painting, although I'm not sure the comparison to drunken, slapdash gibberish is entirely complimentary to either Radiohead *or* Pollock.<br />  This is not to say that \\"Kid A\\" is entirely a waste of time, but it certainly comes closer to a practical joke on the public than their fans (or even desperately credulous music critics) deserve. The praise heaped upon \\"Kid A\\" sounds somehow coerced, as if admitting \\"gee, this is atonal and pointless\\" will be taken as a lack of sophistication and intelligence.<br />  It's not. The Emperor's new clothes are a sham, and so is \\"Kid A\\". Shame on Radiohead ...
B000002GBB|3.0|Artistically, Styx hit their high point with 1977's &quot;Grand Illusion.&quot;  &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; was the carbon copy 1978 follow up album that didn't quite measure up.  The two Styx classics here are Tommy Shaw's aggressive rocker &quot;Renegade&quot; and James Young's equally aggressive working class anthem  &quot;Blue Collar Man.&quot;  Styx's prime ballader, Dennis DeYoung, fails to come up with anything truly memorable this time out.  A few other cuts are likeable enough, including &quot;Sing for the Day,&quot; and &quot;I'm O.K.,&quot; however the sword and sorcery and pirate imagery conjured up by the likes of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and the title track seem hopelessly quaint and dated when brought into the 21st Century.<br />Overall, this one is more for ardent fans than casual listeners.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's early demise was a tragedy for the music community; he was one of its greatest citizens, as evidenced by this beautiful debut.  To listen to his amazing, expressive voice leaves one wondering what more he might have had to offer throughout the years.  What sets Buckley apart from so many music artists is the passion and intensity with which he delivers his keenly introspective lyrics, wrapped in a powerful, yet delicate, wall of sound.  His intelligence and artistry shine through in every song.  This is an album you can really sink your teeth into.
B0000640VN|3.0|I viewed this DVD recently and watched the original \\"theatrical\\" version first.  OK stuff, Meg Ryan's character is as abrasive and unlikeable as most of her recent \\"cute\\" characters seem to be (question: why do movie execs think Meg Ryan being a jerk is so adorable? Inquiring minds...).  But Hugh Jackman is really wonderful as Leopold -- a lovely nuanced portrayal that could have so easily been camp, but which is instead touching and completely believable.  He alone is worth sitting through a basic 2-star comedy-romance for.<br />BUT -- Then for the heck of it, I watched the Director's Cut, just curious to see what had changed.  Well, WOW.  The Director's Cut is much funnier, smarter, and self-aware (one of its first scenes is a cheesy 'movie romantic comedy' scene being judged by Meg Ryan's focus group, with the girl being singled out by all the viewers as 'too unlikeable' -- VERY funny stuff).  It also allows for some additional (and badly needed) character development for Ryan's character, and actually succeeds in making her more three dimensional and lovable.  (Although Meg's yucky spiky haircut still sucks -- it's just not attractive, and (frankly) emphasizes the fact that she's a \\"spunky ingenue\\" pushing 40.)<br />My advice:  Skip the theatrical cut and go straight to the Director's Cut -- Mangold knew what he was doing.
B00005JKCF|5.0|It was the best movie ever,I seen sence Batman,Superman;;;;;<BR>However pg13 was mainly for more parents'review then what the movie was about. I took my 4yr old and my wife for the first openning.  And let me tell you IT WAS GREAT!!!. I did recommended this movie to all my freinds.  My boy loved it and wants to see it again,it is worth the second viewing of the SPIDERMAN movie.
0312265859|5.0|It takes a lot to escape a formula that has worked well for seven previous books, but Janet Evanovich has done it by deepening her plot and giving us a real story for a change. Never fear, though: Stephanieholics are still offered their fair share of the gun in the cookie jar, Grandma Mazur, the Plum Parents (better than ever), Rex the Hamster, Bob the Dog (complete with the barfing we have come to know and love with Bob), the irrepresible Lula the ex-ho, and of course the sexy combatants for Stephanie's hand (or whatever else they can touch): Ranger and Morelli.<br />Stephanie's sister Valerie, complete with her daughter-who-thinks-she's-a-horse, has come into her own in this book, revealing a Burg-worthy personality that is on its way to being as funny as Steph's. And we have a wonderful new character, Albert Kloughn (pronounced \\"Clown,\\" but don't tell Albert I said so), a lawyer without any cases, and the body of the Pillsbury Doughboy.<br />With all this, however, there is a story here. And it displays more reality than Stephanie has had to face in many a book. She is asked to find a missing woman and child, known to all in the tight-knit Burg, who are on the run from an abusive husband/father and a sadomasochistic, extremely dangerous, and not at all funny head of a gangster \\"family.\\" Evelyn, the missing woman, and her 7-year-old daughter Annie, are in real danger, and as hilarious as Stephanie can be, this part is not played for laughs.<br />The result is a perfect blend of laugh-aloud (and I did, many times) vintage Stephanie, and a new, welcome turn in the series that has probably saved its life. As a loyal reader, I'm thrilled with this serendipitous turn of events, especially since I can still count on at least one blown-up car no matter how serious the plot.<br />Oh...one other thing before I head off with Steph to grab some donuts...things with Ranger AND Morelli...heheheheh. I can say no more. Read the book!!!
B00004W50T|5.0|I was a little bit surprised by \\"Music From Big Pink\\" on my first listen, as were most listeners back in 1968, I imagine. I first heard it last year, being into rootsy, folksy rock, I thought it would be right up my alley. After reading many reviews, I was led to believe that this was a stripped down, roots-affair. I was expecting something much like The Byrds' \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\". Yes, \\"Music From Big Pink\\" is pretty much unlike anything else released in 1968 (\\"Sweetheart\\" notwithstanding), but it's not entirely the earthen, fiddles and mandolins type of record I expected. The first sound we hear on the album is Robbie Robertson's guitar fed through a Leslie speaker box on Tears of Rage. Robertson's guitar is quite present on \\"Big Pink\\". No, there's no extended solos and guitar jamming, but the album is not entirely devoid of guitar solos. Robertson plays a brief solo on \\"To Kingdom Come\\". Garth Hudson's keyboards sometimes have a kind of funky, whacked-out sound. So, \\"Music From Big Pink\\" is not quite \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" as I was led to believe. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm not putting it down. I love this album. It's excellent from start to finish. The harmonies are beautiful, the music exquisite and the songwriting brilliant. It took me a few listens to get into, but now I love this album from beginning to end. Every song is great. I'm very glad I picked it up, even though it wasn't quite what I initially expected. Anyone who likes good music should definitely own this.
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna proves she can sing with this CD.  This album contains her best love songs, especially bitter ones.  She sings about loss of love and her own independence.  Madonna shines in this CD because she proves she can do more than sing pop songs only about sex.  It is one of my favorite CD's since it is so beautiful and easy to relate to many of her songs.
B00004XMV6|4.0|Within the context of its genre 9 1/2 Weeks is the best by streaks. A sensory tour de force, which excels not for its sex but mostly for film production methodologies which produce a landscape of disturbing imagery and sounds. <br />Stylish, sexy art house soft-core is a fitting description but there is so much more to the experience that is, 9 1/2 Weeks. Foremost on the list is the films mesmerizing and intriguing vibe as generated through a variety of channels of which visionary content tops the list.<BR> <BR>The eroticism of 9 1/2 Weeks {not of the sex or of the relationship} stem equally from other almost elusive sources through a well spun combination of sensory elements. <br />The abundant black & white scenery is revealing. Black & white set amongst symmetrical lines; an orderly sterile world devoid of comfort and broad appeal. Gleaming white spaces with walls brighter than a set of current day Hollywood teeth. <br />9 1/2 Weeks is bursting with powerful moments. The first glance in the Chinatown deli, Elizabeth's private viewing of fine abstract modern art as a prelude to her masturbating {what was she thinking in the moments prior to ecstasy?} Can the answers be found in the slides she's appraising? <br />As a sexual escapade it is a credible and welcome departure from mainstream.
0312265859|2.0|Big disappointment. Stephanie's cars blow up, she loses handcuffs, she still hates shooting her gun, although she's a hell of a marksman in her apartment building. The whole Abruzzi plot is contrived and fizzles in the end. As does the \\"GREAT RANGER SEX SCENE\\" which is about as long as this review. You'd think a romance writer could have done a better sex scene, especially after building it up for seven books. Let's just say the seeming extent of Ranger's sexual prowess could be called \\"Hard Ate.\\" Big deal. Marv Albert does that and he's no mysterious, rock-hard bounty hunter. <br />Janet is still good at getting laughs, although much less frequently than before. She needs to put more work into character development and plot. It's time to move on from Stephanie being a stupid, but lovable, idiot. <br />After this, I'm waiting for Nine in paperback.
B000006IUQ|4.0|Whoa, old people are smart. One of the richest men in the world is stranded in the woods with a model photographer and a whiny guy who just gets in the way. After their plane crashed, the pilot had died on impact and the three men argued with each other. They shouldn't die of shame, so they should walk towards their cabin. Unfortunately, it's over 80 miles away and they don't have anything to eat. The billionaire (Anthony Hopkins) leads the pack and they encounter a man-killing bear. Alec Baldwin is the photographer who is suspected of having an affair with Hopkins' wife played by Elle McPherson. The noisy guy is played by somebody worth no recognition. Bart the Bear delivers his best performance as the bear on the loose. They overcome most of the odds and live in the wild, temporarily. After the noisy guy was eaten, the two men decided to fight the bear. \\"What one man can do, another can do!\\" Then the camera zoomed in on Hopkins' face and he delivers one of the funniest lines in history, \\"...cuz today, I'm going to kill the MF.\\" Classic. I don't think I want to go camping ever again or wait, go camping for the first time after watching this movie. Those people on \\"Survivor\\" are lucky they have rice and competitions to earn food. No, these men actually have to catch living animals to stay in the game. No Jeff Probst to annoy them, they have each other to do that. This movie is great with its surviving the game plot, but falls on its face when it involves the affair the photographer and the wife had. They should have left that out. But, oh well. Good movie.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down was amazing. One of the best war films ever. The fighting dosent start untill about thirty minutes in to the film, then it is non-stop for about two hours. Ridley Scotts vision is awesome. This film captures the heroism and the emotion of what these soliers went through. In the future this film will no doubt be a classic.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Ooops...She's got the Charm n a way to reach into your heart! When I first saw Oops I did it again video, the sweet innocence step right into the groove n I grabbed the pick of the disc right away. The music is feet tapping n Britney's vocals delivers sweet ringing soft clear n powerful voice. She is a teen sensation. Though my fav always had been Debbie Gibson, I cant resist recommending Brits coz she's proved 'Excellent' with all her numbers. Oops I did it Again is undoubtedly the 'Best'. Lucky is a cheery number with Brits dancing in cool steps n Satisfaction is feet romping music too. Stronger, Dont go knocking on my door are equally good numbers but I feel her 'You drive me Crazy...I am so excited I meant to be' later with new albums n discs have better performances n vocal of Britney spears. A sure pick, relax n enjoy! She's got cool voice, anyway!
B00005UEAR|4.0|Yeah, I love that Overture thingy they got goin' here. The more bombastic the better imho. I think it's very creative, familiar and just all around wierd and wonderful. A full symphony it is. I know some fans of DT don't dig this part of the lp, but I think it's one of the highlights. The rest of the music is great as well. And I have always liked Labrie's voice and think he is perfect for DT. Sometimes a bit over the top, but always a pleasure to my ears.
B00005QFHG|4.0|Movies are a form of escapism. Escapism into sci-fi, pre-historic times or just plain vicarious living. In this case it's escaping into the fact that chocolate will \\"cure\\" what ails you. I must have believed it too, because I bought a Skor bar after the movie. <br />The cast is terrific. The scenery is breathtaking. The cast in the scenery is terrifically breathataking. Once more, casting chocolate is breathtakingly terrific. As for those anti-Catholic naysayers, well Accepting Change is more apt to this fairy tale than being anti-tradition. I gave up chocolate for Lent, but watched Chocolat on DVD, all the while. Usually, when I have the time to watch a 2 hour long movie, two-thirds into the movie, I know if a movie is good or bad, and while Chocolat may have run 20 minutes longer than necessary, it is worth it in the end. A very rare exception in today's crop of [movies]
B000056PWV|5.0|To maintain interest for 112 minutes in a movie that has one set,you've got to have a good script,and JOHN MICHAEL HAYE's for this film is almost perfect.HITCHCOCK is clearly at his peak here,working with a crew that understands his vision.The casting is examplary in every aspect;GRACE KELLY shines with her feminine charm;THELMA RITTER was one of the best supporting actress of her time and JAMES STEWART was tailor made for his role.A  suspense film  like this was quite unusual in 1954.What makes HITCHCOCK such a great director is his attention for details:the ring in GRACE's hand near the end;the way that HITCHCOCK combines the appetites of sex prelude and murder without insisting too much but making his point.If you pay attention,this film actually has a lot to say about the human nature.You should watch this movie twice to fully appreciate it.Many youngsters, brainwashed by the thrillers of our time ,that manages a few killings every fifteen minutes will be bored by this film.It is in fact stylish and  intelligently conceived.One of HITCHCOCK'S 10 best ever.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's album \\"Let Go\\" is defiantly a blast. It deals with the topics that every teenager could relate to. Her first single \\"Complicated\\" talks about how teenagers try to be someone else and not be true to themselves to be liked and accepted. Her song \\"sk8er boi\\" talks about the same topic but she learns it is a mistake. The song also teaches you to be open minded and don't judge people by their appearances when many teenagers realize when it's too late or after they suffered from experiences. Most of her songs teach you good lessons on life and to be whom you are and have fun. Her album is defiantly awesome and it will sweep you away. You will listen to it over and over again. It is also good when you are in a bad mood because when you turn on her music, you seem to forget everything that is bothering you and will help you get through them. There is no reason why you shouldn't buy the album and I am positive that you will like it.
B000002I27|5.0|It is more than a little strange listening to &quot;Strange Days&quot; again 35 years after its release, recalling how exciting it was then.  The Doors were not the only unique band with a unique sound, but it is hard to imagine any others of those whose music has proven so timeless.<br />This looks like but is not a concept album.  The songs and the cover echo the theme suggested by the title and the title song, but musically and lyrically the album is not that cohesive.  It is readily apparent that the songs were not written as part of a concept album, and the band lacked the discipline to make the album a masterpiece.  The ponderous &quot;When the Music's Over&quot; suggests great seriousness, but it is the radio hit tunes -- especially &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; -- which work best.<br />The Doors' sound even today evokes the mystery, hope, and despair we felt in the Sixties like few other artists.  While other bands were playing music deeply derivative of rock and roll roots, the Doors were exploring new places.  <br />&quot;Strange Days&quot; remains less stunning and more accessible than their more shocking debut self-titled LP, and both more daring and more accessible than the albums which followed.  No lover of timeless rock music should be without it.

B000066NW0|5.0|This CD does not only accomplish the need for rock and pop for all you rock/pop fans, but it also has a certain kick! Avril Lavigne has an attitude that would make any rock fan like her, she is a complete punk!!! This CD is amazing and I would greatly recommend it! In my point of view, she is the best young female artist of our time!!
B00005JKWJ|3.0|I walked out of the cinema as the closing credits for Blade II flashed behind me, my heart racing and a little highlight reel of the movie flashing through my head.  Right from the outset Wesley Snipes (star), David Goyer (writer) & Guillermo del Toro (director) have to the foot to the floor for this blood-soaked sequel.<br />Big thumbs up to Goyer and del Toro for keeping enough similarities between this movie and the original to keep the fan base but injecting enough new material to keep original and fresh.  The first thing you will notice is that this movie is a lot gorier than the previous installment.  Not having seen any of the director's previous efforts I don't know if this is common for him but I think it will catch a lot of fans from the first movie off guard.  Mostly it is B-Grade gore, reminiscent of say an Evil Dead movie, so horror buffs should be at home, but those who have came for a glimpse of Welsey's buff black body may be in for a shock.<br />Without giving too much away about the story, Blade has to ally himself with a gang of elite vampire warriors (led by Red Dwarf's Danny John Jules) to defeat a common enemy in the Reaper Nomak and his brood.  Basically Reapers are the next \\"mutuation\\" of the vampirism \\"virus\\" that prey indiscriminantly on both humans and vampires.<br />From here on the movie follows a pretty established \\"bug hunt\\" story through the sewers of err somewhere in Hungary.  The scenario is quite similar to Aliens but still well executed, well shot, moody and exciting.<br />Two hours of exhilarting action, blood, bullets and gore later the movie hits an actioned packed climax, which owes more than a little debt to Blade Runner, and the inevitable final showdown between Blade and his adversary.  The final fight scene is truly breathtaking and well executed as are all the fights in the movie.<br />Overall just like the first installment Blade II is great, lightweight, mindless fun.  Another great blend of superhere action and horror.While the lack of a charming heart throb villian like Stephen Dorf's Deacon Frost has taken some of the sex appeal from the movie it is still great for any fans of action or horror movies or just super hero movies like Tim Burton's Batman or The Crow.
B000067CPX|5.0|Awesome disc period. At no point listening to this cd do i get bored at all. The variety they present is amazing. They sound like sublime on a couple songs, and then they bust out a mexican sounding song, to go along with their usual form which is simply amazing. Flea and Frishante are two of the best guitar/bass duos in history, and Kiedis is one of the best frontmen of our time. Best Chili Peppers album yet, Best album yet this year.
B00005JLDW|3.0|This is one tough movie.  Let me set the scene...<br />Underground in London, England a group of miners drill far into a cavern and  reach a \\"void\\".  They can't see too far inside, so they send the young son of one miner to peek inside for them.   The young boy, Quinn steps into the warm hole and discovers an ancient cavern, only he isn't alone.  Some very big creepy-crawly, scaled monsters begin to move and come to life.  Quinn becomes instantly famous as the young boy who sets first eyes on a new modern terror.  He saw a creature so ancient, that what was once myth will soon become an ungodly legend. He saw the dragons awake from hybernation to wreak havoc and death across the world.<br />Fast forward to the year 2020. Quinn (a very buff Christian Bale from \\"American Psycho\\") lives in a run down fortress protecting families, friends, and children from the world of crispy-fried cities and the dangers of being seen by the dragons that have multiplied to millions. He and his residents live in fear. They learn survival techniques, but their future seems uncertain.  Food, water, and safety aren't perfect designs in their system to stay alive.  They run and they hide.<br />Chapter two begins when Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey \\"The Wedding Planner\\") arrives as the American hero...the dragonslayer. He is the unwanted savior who decides to keep Quinn's people from hiding and share his secrets to his hunting success.<BR>Once he and Quinn finish facing off man to man in some serious muscle-bulging fighting scenes, they agree to work together.<br />The movie takes on an action packed tone that quickens the heart rate and clenches the jaw.<br />A note about the atmosphere of the movie...It was very reminiscent of the original \\"Dragonslayer\\". Quinn's medieval, castle-like fortress and the foggy skies lend an ancient and sometimes religious symbolism to the movie. On the tough side..Van Zan has a rough, heavy arsenal of weapons to do his dirty work. Each man seems to represent adifferent era in time.<BR>many scenes had a dirty Camelot feel, while others seemed more an ode to Mad Max films.  The combination made the movie special.<br />Why I didn't give this movie 5 stars:<br />1.  Not enough close-ups with the dragons..They looked very convincing, but I wanted more.<br />2.  The major action sequences are short.  I expected an action packed movie, but a hefty percent of this movie takes place inside Quinn's fortress.<br />3. The ending..enough said there.  It didn't work.<br />4. It should have been rated 'R'...ashed and torched soldiers are a bit much for younger adults.<br />This movie is not the best summer flick. It can't compete with \\"Minority Report\\", but if you wan't some old fashioned thrills, lots of on your edge moments, and jaw dropping scenes...this is a great movie to see and own.<BR>I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the original \\"Dragonslayer\\" and wished it had more muscle.<br />The Soundtrack may be promising as well. I recall hearing a great Hendrix song during a scene, but alas, I failed to catch the credits.<br />Enjoy.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's cd is one of the best cd's I've heard for a while. Every cd you could buy in the last, let's say, two years, are all the same, &quot;Ooh, I love you, I want you, I want to get it on&quot; kind of deal, and it's all just played out. So when I heard Avril for the first time, it was like &quot;It's about stinkin time.&quot; The difference between Avril and all the other peoples..is that Avril just seems real. It's like, she's so much like me and my friends, and it's awesome. There's not one song on that cd that I don't like, and the song &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; is great. (Nice play on words Avril...lol). You'll def. want to buy this cd.
078322706X|5.0|I just watched this movie again and was swept away by the story, romance,cinematography and musical score. I watch many  movies, few that I bother to watch again, but this is one that I have watched many times and each time I enjoy it more. If you have a heart you will love this movie. Martin Brest directed this wonderfully and I'm anxiously awaiting his next movie, Brad Pitt at his best romantic performance and Claire Florlani is captivating.
B000002URV|5.0|Enigma is one of those ambient acts where you can pop in one of their cds and just completely relax to the light, airy, sensuous melodies without being completely bored.&quot;MCMX A.D&quot; is probably the group's most well-known album  because of &quot;Sadeness&quot;, a favorite track for a lot of new age compilations. I remember when I had to get fillings for a few cavities, I was given a list of cds to listen to while the dentist used a laser to fill in the spots where the cavities were on my teeth. &quot;MCMX A.D&quot; was one of the cds I chose to listen to. The music was very soothing and relaxing while I had to sit still in the dentist's chair. I found it interesting how the tracks were listed on this album. Instead of the traditional 1,2,3...etc...etc..., The tracklist consists of seven different movements with one or two more sectors. The songs consistantly flows together like a stream. I particularly enjoyed the &quot;Principles of Lust&quot; movement where &quot;Find Love&quot; is sandwiched between &quot;Sadness&quot; and the reprise of &quot;Sadeness&quot;. I think by now everyone is familiar with the recognizable Gregorian chants of &quot;Sadeness&quot;. I can never tire of that song although I do like &quot;Return to Innocence&quot; (off their next album) just slightly more. &quot;Callas Went Away&quot; is a breathtaking track with the minimal ambient beats and a very brief sample of the late and great opera singer Maria Callas. &quot;Mea Culpa&quot; is a great song. It begins with the same Gregorian chants from &quot;Sadeness&quot; but picks up the pace and we are introduced to the voices of Sandra Cretu and her husband Michael who is the brains behind Enigma. &quot;Mea Culpa&quot; does sound quite a bit like &quot;Sadeness&quot;, almost a part 2 version of the song. I absolutely adore &quot;Knocking On Forbidden Doors&quot;. It is simply a beautiful song. Now while &quot;MCMXC A.D&quot; isn't at the top of my list as favorite Enigma cds goes, it is still good nevertheless.still good nevertheless.
038533558X|5.0|Fresh off of reading _Tell No One_, I still craved more of Coben's magnetic characters, unanticipated plot complications, and _Sixth Sense_like endings; He (Coben) transcendes all parameters of imagination in _Gone For Good_. I rank this as the 3rd-best novel I have ever read (behind 1. _The Pic. of Dorian Gray_ and 2. _The Man Who Wrote The Book_). Witty but believable dialogue, caring but engrossing characters, a conclusion that....--all of these make Coben's _Gone For Good_ the bellwether against which fiction should be judged. (Good luck to the competitors!)
B00005N5S5|4.0|Terminator is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest movie. It is truely a classic action science fiction show that cannot be miss. Great special effects consider this ia a rather old movie.
B00000JCOV|4.0|This is a really good CD if a little stupid at times, by that meaning nu-metal [poop], but they make up for it with most of the singing, i always liked this CD but it wasnt until i heard scissors that i reallized they really had something, corey captures something insane in that song(the first section of it) and it really makes the CD
B000067G3C|5.0|Speed is one of my favourite action movie beside die hard series. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock really shine in this movie. From lift to bus to train, all scenes are exciting! Not to be miss if you like action movies. Highly recommended.
B000067CPX|5.0|This latest Red Hot Chili Peppers release is a masterpiece in its own right. Although softer and more mellow than their previous albums, the group manages to maintain the same intensity throughout, while creating (and ever-innovating)songs that compliment their legendary status. By the Way contains a lot more depth and complexity than most of their aforementioned work (with the exception of such 'Under the Bridge,' 'My Friends' or the universally-appreciated 'Californication'), and is a perfect combination of melodious harmonies, stunning guitar solos, warm, riveting bass, and razor-edged drums. I would definitely recommend this album to any true Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and music lover alike!
B000068MFS|5.0|I'd have given this movie 10 stars if they allowed it.  While some might say this is predictable and soppy etc (and they are right), it's such a great movie and I could watch it a thousand times in a row.  Not only is John Cusack totally gorgeous, but in this, he's funny and romantic.  Jeremy Piven and Kate also give fantastic performances in Serendipity and one of the funniest people in the cast is Eugine Levy.  He's one great dude.  If you like Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail and the like, then you'll truley love this too.
0312265859|3.0|Hard Eight is edgier, darker, more complex than the previous 7 Plum books. The writing is better and tighter. She's doing a better job of character development. That said, Stephanie Plum needs a new bag, literally and figuratively. After all this time, Steph still loses her quarry because she can't find her handcuffs, pepper spray, stun gun, etc. in her bottomless handbag. Her car keeps getting destroyed, frequently because she forgot to lock it. She gets hurt because she forgot to charge her stun gun or because she forgot to buy bullets. Ms Evanovich, could you wise Steph up a little? Write her so she can put her hands on her cuffs? Give her some smarts? Teach her to lock her car door?  At first, this incompetence was funny, but now -- it's annoying! <BR>Perhaps Evanovich has run out of funny ideas, and must resort to bumbling for humor. If so, she's writing herself out of a job.  Steph's disasters aren't funny anymore, and before I buy the ninth book, I'm checking it out of the library to see if it's worth it.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This movie is awesome. This is the birth of the genius director Kevin Smith and the greatest duo ever, Jay and Silent Bob. So funny, and so much that can easily be miss, you have to watch it several times to get everything. Awesome movie.
B0000062S0|3.0|Trying to Scale the Heights and ending up halfway<br />In 1998, Page and Plant of Led Zeppelin fame released this album and commenced a tour, with their old bandmate John Paul Jones mysteriously missing.  From the liner notes of Zeppelin's 1990 box set, it gave the impression these boys were like brothers, so why he wasn't invited to come along on this little musical jaunt into Page and Plant's musical past has puzzled many a listener.  Page and Plant released a live album in 1994, largely comprised of old Zeppelin tracks with a heavy world-beat thrown in for good measure.  They forgot to invite Jones that time too.<br />I actually got to see a show from that tour, which threw some revelation on this record.  Page & Plant mostly played old Zeppelin tunes with the exception of a couple oftracks from CLARKSDALE.  At the time they were pushing that they were into their new music and that the fan-base should give it a chance, though they neglected to include much of it in the setlists, which is rather revealing.<br />WALKING INTO CLARKSDALE is a rather hit and miss affair.  One of the biggest problems this record faces as well is that the audience will have certain expectations which simply cannot be cut away.  The album plays up to these expectations, and Plant and Page are honestly trying to musically progress and you can truly hear the effort.  That's what makes this such a frustrating listen.  You can here the potential, and you watch Page and Plant as they struggle to realise a successful collaboration.  Ultimately they fail, resulting in a record which simply doesn't flow.  In this regard, WALKING INTO CLARKSDALE is a fascinating listen, and an extremely frustrating one at that.  You can tell where they're wanting to go, and perhaps had Page and Plant had Bonham and Jones around the record would have been fully realised.  However, Bonham is dead and Page & Plant conveniently forgot Jones' phone number, and this is the result. <br />While there are some ultimatelygreat tracks on here (the two singles \\"Shining in the Light\\" and \\"Most High\\"), ultimately the album gets bogged down in potentially Zeppelenesque tracks (not so much in the actual sound by the artistic progression that Zeppelin was on before Bonham's death) that ultimately end up going nowhere.  At their musical peak, Led Zeppelin took a diverse array of influences (blues, mysticism, folk, and an over-the-top bombastic sound) and made them gel into a cohesive whole, culminating in what Plant calls the definitive Zeppelin song (\\"Kashmire\\").  Here, we get that restless sense of musical experimentation, and when it works it works very well.  \\"Shining in the Light,\\" \\"When the World Was Young,\\" \\"Most High,\\" parts of the title cut, \\"When I was a Child,\\" and \\"Sons of Freedom\\" more or less are successful, but especially the firs three.  The rest of the album never comes together in any sort of unity, and while we get the sense that Page and Plant are trying to rejuvenate their musical relationship, ultimately we have to write off half the album as just not top of the line, or even mostly good for that matter.  <br />P. S.  Clarksdale is one of the big spots where Blues really got its birth, and from the title some may expect this to be heavily drenched in that style of music.  It's not.  There's not a lot of blues on this one, and what there is has been strained through Page and Plant's unsuccessful attempts to be relevant again, so for the blues fans in the Zeppelin camp this record's a total write-off...
B00005A1PR|5.0|Not only is this CD addictive, it has something to say.  It's not pointless pop marketed to make money.  When India Arie sings, she has a reason and a rhyme to it.  She has a point.  Her music is amazing, and it touches your soul deeper than you thought possible.  I had heard Video and loved the song, but not enough to go out and purchase the CD.  A friend of mine bought it for me for Christmas, and I was blown away.  It's soft, chill-out music that makes you think.  Highly recommended, even for people (like me) who preferring harder, even poppier music.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Having recently bought Seasons 1 and 2 of TNG, I am eagerly awaiting the release of Deep Space Nine on DVD. I agree with other reviewers who point out the strength of the cast and depth of the plot in DS9. In a way DS9 is starting again for the crew of the station, they have to rebuild much of the stations instruments and try to get to grips with a new set of relationships between Cardassia and Bajor. The senior staff are extreamly well picked, but it is the non starfleet characters who perhaps are more impressive. Garek, Gul Dukat, Quark, Odo and the Kye are all well played by solid actors and actresses.<br />As the programme progresses we understand the crew more and are treated to the Dominion, War, Klingons, Romulans, Vorta, shape shifting and much more. Hurry up and release DS9.
B00004YX39|5.0|Steely Dan's, &quot;Gaucho,&quot; Was the last album Walter Becker and Donald Fagen would release for over 20 years. With some help from Tom Scott, They would fill much of the album with great horns that have become the standard. So many of the cuts are good on this thing, but the ones that stand out are &quot;Glamor Profession&quot; and &quot;Time Out Of Mind.&quot; This definately has to be in your collection!!
B000067CPX|5.0|If you don't have this CD yet, you will soon.  I guarantee it.  All 16 tracks rate 5 stars IMH0.  I'm really looking forward to seeing THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS - IN CONCERT, IN HAWAII on July 31st!  Lucky to live in paradise as they say...
0451167716|5.0|Puzo is a god and a genius! The Godfather is by far the best book i've ever read, and i've read them all! I absolutly loved this book, if your thinking about reading it, i suggest you do!
0671027573|5.0|I absolutely loved this story on Jaine Bright and Sam Donovan!<BR>First off all, it was hilarious when she assumed her next door neighobr, Sam was a drunk instead of a cop. I have to say, Linda Howard is the best author in the world and this is my absolute favorite book. I can't wait for the new releases to come out!<BR>I can't tell you how many times I actually read this book-maybe seven. In my 14 years of life, I decided that romance is the best kind of novels and boring lawyers stories are the worst kind. I have to say that I read maybe 20 novels a week if I have no school and her romantic suspense novels keep you guessing till the end of the book. The killer is obviously someone who is angered by the list for the &quot;perfect man&quot; that Janie created with her friends. The passion between Jaine and Sam was a bit strange but as long as they had a future together I don't see why anyone can't just love this book. The only author who can come close to her is Kay Hooper! The killer will surprise you when you find out whom it is.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have promised myself to buy all the top TV shows, as long as they have a french track. I loved THE SIMPSONS and M.A.S.H. (they DO have a french track!) and I hated ALL IN THE FAMILY and FRIENDS (no french track!).<br />I was so upset, especially with FRIENDS, that I'm considering buying a regional-free dvd player, just to play the European version (It comes with English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian language tracks, WHAT A DELIGHT FOR A LANGUAGE LOVER LIKE ME!!!!!!)
B00003CXRM|5.0|From beginning to the end, this movie is a hoot!<br />The story is loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey. George Clooney is Ulysses. who is trying to go home to his wife. On the way he has adventures. The Sirens call. Those three women washing clothes in the water are  the Sirens. John Goodman is the Cyclops, the one eyed monster. Clooney's wife is Penelope. The blind man on the handcar on the train track is Homer.<br />I have watched this movie three times in three weeks. It makes me feel good.<br />Notice the order of the scenes: day, night, day, night, day, no night, day, night, day, night, and day.<br />In the first half of the movie, the three men fear the day. They have escaped the chain gang and they do not want to be recognized. They are more comfortable in the night in the woods around the camp fire.<br />In the second half of the movie, the three men are more comfortable in the daytime. The fires at night have become torches of evil. The night scene of white robed and white hooded white men dancing in the woods by a burning  cross is a deep American nightmare. <br />And the music! The songs are so deeply American. The songs make me sad, make me sleepy, make me cry, make me laugh, make me stamp my feet and stick my fingers in my mouth to whistle as loud as I can.<br />That may be why this movie attracts me so. The scenes are icons of such deep American imagery.: chain gangs, apple pie cooling in the window, flat farmland, model T Fords,  burning crosses,  lynch mobs, etc.<br />I repeat, this movie makes me feel good. Every image is uniquely American . The music is uniquely American.  It makes me feel good to be American.<br />This movie is a hoot!
B00005JKNC|4.0|Jim Carrey plays it straight in this movie about a young Hollywood screenwriter who is beginning to live the good life just as the McCarthy era begins.  He is being accused of Communist ties (a false allegation) as he takes a drive and has an accident which causes him to lose his memory.  He is discovered by the people in a small California town who think he is a presumed-dead war hero who has been missing for 9 years.  The town is thrilled to welcome him back, especially his father, played by Martin Landau, and his girlfriend.  He lives the life of a hero, until his memory begins to return and the Feds track him down and return him to Hollywood and then Washington to appear before the House Unamerican Activities Committee.  Carrey turns in a fine performance in an entertaining film that only occasionally goes over the top with patriotic fervor.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I personally loved the movie.  The computer effects where wonderful, and the greatly talented Milla Jovovich brought so much to the movie.  I was stunned when I saw people walking out of the theater, and complaining about it outside the theater.  I agree, the zombies where laughable, but arent all zombies?  I have never seen one zombie movie that has scared me.  Infact, my friends and I often rent zombie movies to laugh at them.  How can a rotting corpse with no brain, stummbling about and making odd groaning noises not be funny?  But, back to Resident Evil, there was a good story line, the emotions were fully felt, plus great gore.  What more could you want in a movie?  Im just hopeing there will be a sequel, (judgeing by the ending scene).
B000067CPX|5.0|I usually don't pay too much attention to critics, but after Rollingstone gave this 4 stars, I was very curious.  They weren't wrong.  This is the best piece of work the Chili Peppers have ever put out!  Every song is interesting, and many are unforgettable.  This is their most musical CD to date also, with rich harmonies and unique melodies everywhere.  Sure, it's different from their earlier days, but this is not a bad thing.  It just shows how they've evolved.  &quot;By The Way&quot;  will be in my CD player for quite some time.  DO NOT MISS THIS!
B000067G3C|5.0|This is the film that made Keanu Reeves a bankable action film star. Of course, it was overdue anyway, based on his stellar performance in Point Break a few years before, but this was the one that lit him up like a Christmas tree on the pantheon of Hollywood somebodies. The plot is simple yet imaginative; an ex-cop demolition expert with a grudge decides to put a busful of hostages at risk by rigging it to explode if its speed goes below 50 miles an hour. So place these people (including a reluctant Sanda Bullock as the drafted designated bus driver), add Keanu as the cop trying to keep the busful of civilians straight and catch the bad guy (played well by Dennis Hopper)and Jeff Daniels playing the other cop trying to figure out the demolition angle from back at the station, and you have all the ingredients for a terrific and very entertaining movie.<br />Which, of course, it is. It is unusual, very well acted, and the action sequences simply steal the movie. There is very little down time in the movie, and like the early Jaws, one finds oneself reeling from the action as it goes literally from one situation to another. The way the action scenes are choreographed and plotted makes one want to run for cover as the bus screams through a bevy of hairy circumstances one would think are going to doom it and the passengers to a fiery death. Suffice it to say that this is well worth your time and money, and that this new DVD version has a lot of added features regarding the film that make it even more fun to enjoy. Sit down and get your popcorn ready folks! The film is about to roll. enjoy!

B00005A3KS|5.0|Before \\"Speed\\", before \\"The Matrix\\" or any of a half dozen other memorable films that Keanu Reeves has been in, there was \\"Point Break\\".  For sheer action, adrenaline, and quick thrills, nothing compares to this cops and robber movie set in the surfer sub culture of southern California. Keanu Reeves plays a young FBI recruit (Johnny Utah) on his first assignment, and lands in the middle of a bank robbery mystery that has been unraveling for several years. A group calling themselves the Ex-Presidents, and wearing outlanding disguises as Ron Reagan, Dick Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson, have successfully been looting area banks, so far without shooting or killing anyone. Reeves' older partner, played masterfully here by Gary Busey, confides to Keanu that he believes the bank robbers are surfers, who hit banks to support their wandering lifestyles, following the waves.<br />Suddenly the stage is set for a masterful cat and mouse game between Busey and Reeves on the one hand, and a group of surfers led by Patrick Swayze, on the other. The movie has everything, from gloriously photographed scenes of surfing to outrageous action sequences which are choreographed so memorably that they become the coda for the movie. There are several exceptional chase scenes, including one that is run by foot through yards, houses, and streets. In the end, it is a powerful allegory regarding the meaning of contemporary life and the rules we all try to live by, but in the meantime it is also a hell of an entertaining ride on the rollercoaster that Reeves and Busey have to ride in pursuit of the Ex-Presidents! \\"Surfers rule, I swear to God\\". Hahaha. Inside joke that you'll understand after viewing the film. Enjoy!
B000002HRE|5.0|Metallica can do no wrong. Each couple of cds have distinct flavors that create a diverse realm completely OWNED by the metal gods. Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets are faster, and heavier. Load and reload are much slower, but they have a thicker sound. The difference between a thick sound and a heavy sound (in case anyone was wondering) is this: Heavier is a lots more guitar with some heavy bass. Thicker is heavy bass, macho drums, and powerful (yet not screaming) vocals many times with backing vocals in the chorus and such. Try this analogy: heavy=the music is rushing all around you, thicker=you are sinking into the music. In any case, both are great sounds, and both are dominated by metallica. This cd is definately underrated. It belongs with lightning and puppets and deserves the full respect of its fans. Buy this and enjoy every second of the 'thick' sound. peace.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I don't know.  Definitely see the film, but this is really another character study.  Tom Hanks just happens to be stranded on a tropical island.  It's not about being stranded on a tropical island but about Tom Hanks trying to prove what a great character actor he is.  The similar stories, movies, and T.V. shows that  I saw as a child (Robinson Crusoe, Gilligan's Island, pirate stuff, Billy Budd, Typee, war movies where guys get stranded, etc.) were as fun and exciting or more so.   I think that's because those shows were about the situation more than a person's feelings or emotional adaptation the situation.  The whole idea of the genre is to escape mentally to a tropical island, not escape from one.  We want the imagined fantasy of freedom, running around in our underwear with tropical beauties and eating coconuts, not reality. <BR> The ending of Cast Away was cinematic poetry.  People should think (but not too deeply) for a few seconds about what was going on in the last shot.  I wished the moviemakers had stretched for a little more richness and depth in the part of the movie that occurs after Tom Hank's was rescued, including the very end.  They didn't show any change in personality, attitudes, increase in depth of personality, religious awakening, etc.  People who have been in different but far less intense situations, like the Peace Corp, for example, have come back with much more significantly changed attitudes and values about life.  The change could even have been that he came back as a basket case.  It shows a shallowness in the moviemaker's understanding of people both in the Tom Hank's character and in audiences.  I did think Meg Ryan's reactions to Tom Hank's release were well done and authentic.  But this is a movie you watch to be entertained not to analyze!<BR> Tom Hank's is trying too hard to be taken seriously as a great character actor.  I think he's trying to compete with Dinero and Nicholson-- \\"star\\" character actor.  <BR>When we watch Cast Away, we're watching Tom Hanks, and America loves Tom Hanks.  But when we watch Deniro in movies like Mean Streets and Taxi, we're watching the character.  Everything Deniro does with the character fits in perfectly.  Robert Deniro never draws attention to himself in a movie.  He draws attention to the character he is playing.   The same can be said of the younger Robert Duvall.<BR> And sorry, I don't think I can judge female actors.  I sense that many of the great ones were before my time.  But I would put Vivian Leigh on any list of the best.  I am not moved by Merryl Streep.  I think she is more intellectual in preparation than say a Julia Roberts who can emote anything.   Meryl Streep is one who learns accents well, learns to do Irish step dancing, etc to prepare for roles, but can you imagine her trying to play some of the characters Julia Roberts has played?  The movies would bomb.
0345349571|5.0|I won't repeat all the descriptions of the book from the other reviews because they are very accurate, but I will say that the book is an excellent bathroom read. Pick it up and read a few pages everytime you're in there and I guarantee you'll run into chapters that will make you drag the book elsewhere for a longer read. When it bogs down in details that tire you, put it back in the bathroom again. You will finish it eventually and it will be well worth your &quot;spare&quot; time that you spent reading it.
B000005IU2|5.0|I can't think of many albums that are as grounbreaking and as influential as &quot;Funhouse.&quot; When you listen to this, it's best if you listen to it all the way through, because this, ladies and gentlemen, is called an ALBUM. Every song fits together, without sounding the same. All three of the Stooges' albums are great and unique, but this is where they hit their stride. When people call the Stooges a dumb band, I want to hit them in the face. They obviously haven't listened to &quot;Funhouse.&quot;
0380820846|5.0|This book is just great! I think Julia Quinn is a fantastic author and this was her best book yet. It is a touching story of two old friends who fall in love. There aren't a lot of stories like this one out there, and that's a shame. I love the way the author creates deep and meaningful scenes between the hero and heroine without always resorting to sex scene after sex scene like many books i read and which gets boaring fast.This book is my favorite of the series and is different than many romance novels because instead of the characters letting their problems drive them apart they support each other and work together to solve their problems. I am so sick of romance novels in which the hero and heroine have a highly troubled relationship for the whole story and then magically arrive at some happy ending. I can't stress enough what a refreshing change this book was. If you are a fan of real romance, this is the book for you.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hanks successfully protrays a borderline-retarted boy growing up in Alabama. This story brings both laughter and tears, and successfully shows the struggle that Forrest has faced throughout his life. This DVD set also contains a second CD in which life through the eyes of Forrest is portaryed, and the actors in the film give comments. This DVD is worth the money!
0064471837|4.0|Sabriel is a wonderful book, filled with all elements of fantasy. There's not much to say about it that hasn't already been said. This book fills you until you want more and more. I think Nix should have made a series out of this. ;)
6305922756|5.0|Perhaps the funniest non-slapstick movie ever made, &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; is a welcome addition to any DVD collection. Though the format has been best utilized for action and sci-fi films, this comedy DVD truly does the film justice.<br />The transfer is exceptionally clear and crisp, with bright, vivid colors and a great sound mix.  The extras are quite funny and entertaining -- very much worth your time.
B00000DC10|5.0|Contrary to \\"modern\\" airwaves, PUNK is an attitude and not a style.  That said, this CD is great not just because the music SCREAMS and the production is BEYOND BELIEF but because it revives the PUNK ethos in EVERYTHING it does.  Tear it down, build back up again, tear it down again, always full on.  Everything, all the time. REFUSE to accept today as good enough.<br />REFUSED now rank among the great PUNK BANDS like DEAD KENNEDYS and FEAR for their ability to incorporate the punk ethos into every aspect of their MUSIC.  If you think PUNK is about pink mohawks, leather and a music scene then REFUSED is your SALVATION. <br />Fortunately, no one can get away with this forever, and true to their PUNK ethos, REFUSED split soon after the release of this disc.  As a WISE MAN once said, \\"it's better to burn out than to fade away.\\"  However, some of it went on to become INTERNATIONAL NOISE CONSPIRACY.<br />The Shape of Punk to Come: A Chimerical Bombation In 12 Bursts<BR>is the testiment to REFUSED's super nova.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell's awesome.  The computer graphics are so well integrated into the animation that the only visible difference is the framerate.  The plot was incredible, too.  There are very few anime works which I actually have to sit and think about.  Neon Genesis Evangelion was one.  This is the other, to date.  It also carries the distinction of being the only movie I've seen that views the onset of technology as a good thing.  I'd put this in my top three anime works, along with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.
B0000636UN|5.0|This is a GREAT CD! Although some songs are far better than others, overall I really enjoy listening to it. Mainly, the songs are a mix of country and rock - they are very energetic and catchy.<br />Here are some of the very best songs:<br />- Soak up the Sun (1) - great: very nice singing, very catchy<br />- You're an Original (2) - nice rock sound, good singing<br />- Lucky Kid (8) - my personal favorite, very energetic, and always gets stuck in your head<br />- Hole in My Pocket (10) - another energetic song w/a nice melody<br />- Weather Channel (11) - very different (a lot quieter, more subdued) but still good<br />Anyhow, the CD as a whole is very good, with the above songs being totally great! If you like artists like Michelle Branch or bands like Jimmy Eat World (which are based on guitars) you will probably like this, although it is a little different.<br />All in all, this is the perfect summer CD. Just put it on in the car or at home and relax and sing along! I don't know how else to recommend this - get this CD!
6305311463|5.0|An asteroid the size of Texas is hurtling towards Earth sending some meteorites to New York City and some other places in the world. NASA headed by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thorton) decides to send out a group of Oil-Drillers (Will Patton, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Ken Hudson Campbell, Steve Buscemi and Ben Affeleck) lead by Harry Stamper (Bruce Campbell) to be trained as astronauts so they can drill a hole into the asteroid then send them into space before the asteroid destroys mankind.<br /><br />Co-starring Liv Tyler, Keith David, William Fichthner, Jason Issacs, and Udo Kier with a opening narration by Charlton Heston, this is a rockin' Sci-fi action drama from director Michael Bay, co-written by JJ Abrams and Jonathan Hensleigh and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It came out during the same time as the other Asteroid movie \\"Deep Impact\\" in 1998 but this is the more successful of the two movies, i remembered when i was 16 when this came out and i loved it as it became one of my all time favorite movies. The acting is superb including the music by Trevor Rabin with fantastic special effects, this is one of Bay's finest movies while \\"Transformers\\" is his greatest achivement but this is an emotional rollercoaster ride with tears, laughs, action and of course feel good material that makes this a must see ride for everyone.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Criterion Edition DVD offers the film in it's unrated director's cut with never-before-seen footage in the theatrical version plus awesome extras like audio commentaries, Michael Bay's gag-reel, deleted scenes, storyboards and production drawings, analses of the special effects, production designer on the look of Armageddon, Aerosmith music video on the popular \\"I Don't want to miss a thing\\" and trailer, teaser with TV Spots.
630157401X|5.0|After watching Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, I was somewhat apprehensive about Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Often, movies in a trilogy get successively worse as the filmmakers find fewer and fewer original ideas to use. Given that, in my opinion, Temple of Doom was pretty bad, I was concerned that this movie would be even worse. This, however, was not the case! I REALLY enjoyed The Last Crusade, and feel that it is the best of the three movies (which says a lot because I also really liked Raiders of the Lost Ark)!<br />The Last Crusade features many of the elements that made the first in the series so attractive: well done action sequences, humor, and excitement. If you aren't already familiar with Indy's adventures (which is doubtful) I will assure you that they are very entertaining and can be seen by the whole family. Although I am not usually a big fan of action movies, I think the Indiana Jones series (except for the second movie) are really fantastic movies - perfect for relaxation and lighthearted entertainment. Additionally, what makes this movie my favorite in the series is that many of Indy's trademark characteristics (the hat, the whip, the name, etc.) are explained and you learn more about his past. His father's presence also makes him seem more human and realistic.<br />Essentially, the plot of this movie concerns a search for the Holy Grail, which Indy has to get before the Nazis do. Overall, the movie is very exciting, humorous, and well acted. Top honors go to Harrison Ford (of course) as Indy, whose funny expressions and sarcasm are great and to Sean Connery, who does an excellent job portraying Indy's eccentric father.<br />I don't know how else to recommend this...it is the ultimate adventure movie! Have fun!
B000067CPX|5.0|I can't lie.  The first time I heard it I missed the bass slappin, Kiedis Rappin funk.  I got over it. Needless to say, it has grown on me to the point that I have this album playing 24/7.  We are all lucky to have the Red Hot Chilli Peppers alive, together and producing such a masterpiece.  I guess we have to share our Chilli Peppers with the mainstream. Down with boy bands, bring on the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.  This music gives me goosebumps and makes me teary eyed... Sober.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This CD from Shakira is really great. Most of the songs, with a few exceptions, are catchy, spunky and original. Although her lyrics in English are occasionally a bit awkward (for instance, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; sounds much better in Spanish) this is understandable given that it is very difficult to translate songs from Spanish to English. But the freshness and originality of most of her lyrics makes up for their awkwardness.<br />Also, the songs are very energetic and catchy. If you are feeling upset, just turn on the first song, &quot;Objection&quot; - it is guaranteed to cheer you up. Additionally, as shown by &quot;Objection,&quot; Shakira does an excellent job of combining traditional latin music, like the tango, with modern rock guitar sounds. The result is a unique and original sound! Anyhow, if you don't have this CD, you are truly missing out. Get it soon, and enjoy!
0876855575|5.0|Bukowski has really written an amazing novel. This being the first novel by him i've read I was truly blown away. <BR>He dosn't just write about living in hell, but as being the lowest creature of hell, his rejection throughout childhood and his rejection of others are shown in the backdrop of this harsh environment. <BR>I love the chapter when he is alone in bed and there appears the devil, 'god had forsaken you'.<BR>His anger for the world as a child of depression was written beautifully, blunt and brutal. I love the way he begins as this innocent child, inquisitive and still rather happy. As he grows and as the pages get turned his language changes. He becomes angrier, although his quiet stoic demeanour is still prevalent. <BR>I actually connected with Henry on many levels. Buk has written in a manner in which any disenfranchised adolescent could understand. His distaste for the way people try to portray themselves and hate for the 9-5 life are things I can understand.
B000068TSI|5.0|We were soldiers is a harrowing story of an Army regiment surrounded by the N. Vietnam Army.  Not only were they surrounded, but there was more than 4 enemy soldiers for every American.  Based on a book (We were soldiers once...and young-by Col. Harold G. Moore, Joseph Galloway (Contributor)) the movie follows not only the battle but it touches into the family lives of the brave men.  The battle takes place in the La Drang valley at LZ X-ray (you may have heard of that one before if you are familiar with the Vietnam War).  They men had to not only fight to stay alive, but they needed to cope with their fear and they needed to keep it together. If you liked Black Hawk Down (the movie) then you would like this one and probably like it better because it tells you a little more about what was going on. Personally, I thought BHD was great, and this one was exceptional.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone.
B000002BUY|5.0|All I can say about this album is that it's incredible. I'm a huge Incubus fan and this album kicks [butt]. If you've only heard Make Yourself and Morning View (like most people) this is very different from both of them. It's more hardcore, while at the same time peaceful... the songs are deep and complex both with meaning and melody (and reference to weed) ~A good album to listen to when you're stoned :-)
B00003CXI1|3.0|I thought the movie was a bit disappointing. The only reason I knew what the plot was is because I read the book. However, my friends who have not read the book didn't have any idea what was going on in the movie. I gave it three stars because the intricate scenery and the awesome magical effects. All in all, if you're looking for really intricate scenery and a sleepy plot, this is for you.
0062502182|5.0|This book changed my life for the better. All the people that I have recommended this book to have said the same thing. If you let this story take hold of you, you will know the meaning of life. You have to be emotionally prepared for this book so as to know the meaning of life from it. It does not expressly tell you, but through every twist and turn and story you will find it.

0887306101|1.0|There are 3 major flaws to this book<BR>1) Only Trend Traders are interviewed.  I.e. those people who trade with Trends<BR>2) the interviews themselves are uneven with a distinct bias towards people that Schwager liked their house (Seykota, Marcus)<BR>3)  All, except for O'Neill, are extreme liberal democrats with very liberal biases.<br />The crux of the book, excepting of course O'Neill, is that funnny-mentals are something none of them understand so they just watch technical analysis and trade trends.  What does this mean?  Money management is key since most of their trades are unsuccessful.  What makes up MM?  No one will say since that's their only REAL edge.  In the end, read Lefevre's Stock Operator or Niederhoffers Education.  This is boring and basically empty.<br />You do though get to see how these traders live with their wealth<BR>and O yes, most went belly up AFTER meeting with Schwager.
1563890119|4.0|Sandman is commonly regarded as one of the best comic book series' ever told.  Spanning 75 issues, it's not as big as Superman, Batman or Spider-Man, but it's a completey different kind of story.  Neil Gaiman's imagination and style are amazing, which is evident in his ability to create interesting characters, truly gothic locations and one of the most inventive plots ever.  The story starts out a bit too quickly for it's own good.  At first glance, it will appear to be a jumbled bunch of different tidbits and plotlines which appear to be going nowhere.  However, after the first chapter, or issue, the last six included in this book will get clearer and more fluid as they progress.  <br />By the end, you'll have a definite feel for the Sandman universe, being introduced to a few of the main characters and locations, along with the key story elements.  However, this is merely an introduction to the vast tale to come after.  An impressive start to an imaginative epic, Preludes and Nocturnes is exactly what the title implies.  It's short enough to leave you wanting more, and maybe even feeling a tad unsatisfied, but it's long enough and important enough to act as an essential doorway to the amazing series.  <br />Another drawback here, aside from the semi-sketchy start is the length.  The book is only just over 200 pages...Luckily, Amazon is offering it for a few bucks cheaper, but because it's a comic book, it will probably only take you as long as it would take to read a 100 page book, if that...It's definitely a great read, and you'll likely enjoy every minute of it, but as with many graphic novels, the price is steep for what you get, so be warned.<br />The art is amazing stuff, but inconsistent.  Because a variety of different illustrators were used in the writing of the comics, the style will skip around often.  The most noticeable change is how much the Sandman himself changes in appearance, which can be a tad annoying.  For example, I vastly prefer the final chapter to the first, visually.  The general look is always the same, but I wish they would've stuck with one illustrator for the entire series.  It's not only this book in the series which does this--another disappointment.<br />Overall, if you're going to read the others, you HAVE to read this one.  And, while flawed, it's where the story starts, and if you don't read it, you'll be pathetically lost.  It's vastly enjoyable and will keep the pages turning, if not for long.  Fans of comic-books may not be changed by this book, but anyone who likes dark fantasy or horror will most likely find this a very unique and immersive read.
080018789X|5.0|ive watched this film so many times, I could probably recite all of the doalog for you right now, but I wont. Jerry maguire is just brilliuance, im not quite sure where to start, it has everything, brilliant stars acting at there best. Seriusly, Tom Cruise has never been this good ever, and probably never will be again. The plot is increidbly clever, its not to complicated and its not dumb. The humor in this is not excelent, largely because its not imature sexual inuedo based, we all know, the classic \\"SHOW ME THE MONEY\\" but theres so many other moments that will have you laughing till you pee...<BR>This film also has many tear jerking moments, for example, when Rod Tidwel becomes unconcius on the field after a tackle and what feels like the whole world holds there breath untill he says \\"im ok\\"<BR>and of couse Jerrys incredibly sincear speach to get Dorothy  back \\"...I need you, you complete me\\" and her famouse reply \\"you had me at Hello\\"<BR>Just thinking of all these moments makes me want to watch it again. In short this film has everything anyone would ask from it, it is excellence, would cannot decsribe how brilliant it is, buy it, rent it, steal it off a friend, just get it, you have no idea what your missing out on!

The &quot;Two Kings&quot; know their comedy as well as their music, even though they're playing for laughs they know how to make their music rock. I'm eagerly awaiting next CD from &quot;The D&quot;.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The Harry Potter movie was good, altough I was a little dissapointed when they left out some interesting parts. Like the part when Hargrid gave the dragon to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, to give to Charlie. The three of them use the invisibility cloak and loose points for their house. They spent way too much time on the wizard's chess, twoards the end, and they left out the part where they have to drink a potion to go through the dungen. The book was very good and better than the movie. It was good to see the movie just to see how they portrayed all of the characters.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator stands as one of the truly great movies ever made in my books. Like many people, I maintain a fluid list of favorite movies in my head, however, the top three spots have never changed. Star Wars: A New Hope is number one, Aliens is number two and the Terminator is number three. Everything else after that is in a constant state of flux as I see new films. James Cameron's opus will always be Aliens, but the Terminator is his second best work and his directorial debut. This film is exquisite start to finish and a masterpiece of contrasting imagery that spans forty years between the stark, rain swept night time streets of `present day' Los Angeles in 1984, and a dark, foreboding future where mankind clings to life in a terrific struggle against the machines.<br />The film opens in Los Angeles of 2029. Silvery aerial and tracked hunter-killer tanks roll relentlessly across field of shattered human skulls, searching for pockets of humanity to exterminate. The whine of engines and the purple flash and deep resonant pulse of the plasma cannons highlight a grey, dead city. It sets the stage for the war of the future that will be fought in the present as Skynet, the intelligence created by Cybderdyne Systems, sends a lone cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton), mother of John Conner, who will teach the humans to organize and fight back. It is implied that the humans capture the facility, are able to send a protector to look after her, and make it possible for John to be born. An interesting problem exists in that all the records of Sarah Conner's existence are gone, the Terminator only knew her name and the city in which she lives. Thinking logically, it stars a methodical search using the phone book, and begins killing every Sarah Conner it can find.<br />Part of what makes this movie so perfect is the lead heroine. Nowadays strong female characters, the Mara Jade types, are usually confrontation, arrogant, and mean. Sarah Conner, like Aliens' Ellen Ripley, is a wonderful mix of very attractive qualities. She is thoughtful, intelligent, and possessing of an inner strength that even she doesn't believe she has within her. But at the same time she is depicted as lonely, which leads to a great sense of isolation when she realizes that she is next on the killer's list. And when she is at her most helpless, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) saves her, but not only that. He acts as a spring board for her character to begin delving within to find what she needs to help herself and learn what she must teach her son if he is to be the savior of mankind. The dynamic between Hamilton and Biehn is electric. There is real passion there, because in many ways they are the same person, just reversed. Kyle is a warrior, with a sensitive caring soul held just beneath the surface that Sarah brings to the surface.<br />The action and pacing of the film are first rate as three points converge: The Terminator, Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner, moving towards a flash point and the climax of the film. The Terminator is methodical- procuring weapons, a place to hide, and locating the Sarahs. Kyle is more in the background, but doing essentially the same thing, except he has a picture of Sarah. Conner's only inkling that something is wrong happens when she learns that women with her name are being killed all over LA. And when Sarah is stood up by her date, she opts to go see a movie instead when she realizes that someone is following her. After killing Sarah's roommate and her boyfriend at their apartment, the terminator overhears Sarah calling Ginger for help, revealing her location.  The three points converge is a trendy night club. It's an epochal event as the Terminator finally comes face to face with her. Then with all the aplomb of a man hailing a cab, he singles her out with his laser-sighted .45 and prepares to change history.<br />There follows a series of high speed chases through the streets of LA, and Cameron's telltale style of lighting, often glaring white, shining from the background adds an almost otherworldly effect to mundane things like buildings and cars. When Sarah and Kyle are arrested, the Terminator goes through an entire police station to get her, including Millenium's Lance Henriksen. Escaping into the night, the two prepare for the final confrontation with the mechanized killer. Kyle teaches Sarah how to make pipe bombs while telling her of his world. And he explains why he volunteered to be the one to come back in time. It is in fact Kyle who is John's father, and I'm sure there has to be a temporal paradox in there somewhere.<br />Visually, the film is first rate. Fantasy II's future sequences and Stan Winston's make-up and Terminator endo-skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making. Even in this day and age of CG-everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation. Additionally, for the special edition DVD they redid some of the sound effects, like the Terminator's long-slide .45. There are lots of extras, including deleted scenes, still galleries, and two interview reels with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, plus Biehn and Hamilton. After eighteen years since I first saw it, Terminator is still Number 3 on my list of favorite films, and it always will be.meron's telltale style of lighting, often glaring white, shining from the background adds an almost otherworldly effect to mundane things like buildings and cars.

0446677450|4.0|1-star reviewers just don't *get* this book.  If you're one of the millions who read personal finance books to be told exactly WHERE you're supposed to cut your expenses (no more coffee in the morning!  Never eat out at lunch!) you're going to be very upset with this book.  If you're looking for someone to tell you exactly HOW to invest in what stocks and how to buy real estate... you're going to be disappointed.<br />Robert Kiyosaki is a self-made millionaire, having made successful businesses (everyone remember the velcro wallet in the '80's?!!), failed, and built himself up again.  He writes his series of books NOT to tell people step-by-step what to do and not do... Mr. Kiyosaki narrates and challenges you to question YOUR beliefs and how you run your financial life.<br />A quick example - from the day we start reading financial information in books or the paper, owning a house is a goal (tax benefits and all) and is an Asset to us.  Mr. Kiyosaki challenges your thinking, because a home does NOT bring in money to your life... and is therefore a liability!  Instead of buying bigger and bigger houses, and thereby increasing our expenses... one should consider taking the extra you would be paying on a bigger house and building your own business.  <br />Much of his advice is like that.  A bit off-center, and forces you to *think*.  Although not the end-all of financial books, I can honestly say this book had a postitive, life-changing impact on my life.
B00005Y228|3.0|This may sound kind of shallow, but I had never really heard of Kylie Minogue until I saw her cameo in Moulin Rouge. Her voice was one to be proud of. Then I came across her single Can't Get You Out of My Head which was a fun, dancing tune with Kylie's singing moving right along with the back beats. Those two reasons are the reasons why I decided to buy her cd, Fever. And that's when I found out that Kylie was a UK hit, and had plenty more albums out. But her US release, Fever, was the only one I could find. And there's no bad in that. Fever is a great mix of dance tracks and dance ballads. The goods for me are More, More, More (It's just the beat, I love it), Give It to Me (Kylie's such a temptress here!), Fragile (This is one of Kylie's slower songs, but it's just as good. It's actually my favorite), and Burning Up (A great mix of ballad-like lyrics that switches over to dance floor beats). The remaining tracks on Kylie Minogue's Fever keep the album at a status to where it's certainly worth the purchase. And the cover of the cd ... Wow! Yes?
B0000524E5|5.0|What brought me into watching Coyote Ugly? Exactly what it promoted. Nice looking girls dancing atop a bar to nice songs. But there's so much more to Coyote Ugly than that! Although there are enough entertaining bar dancing scenes to satisfy anyone. Coyote Ugly tells the story of Violet Sanford, an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City  -- away from her protective father -- to pursue her career. While living in a trashy apartment, she is robbed of almost everything she owns, and is quick to find a job. She finds one at Coyote Ugly, one of the hottest bars in NYC. Yet, she finds that serving at this bar is a bit difficult. You also have to dance and entertain. Among the chaos of Coyote Ugly, Violet meets a young man, and a romance is developed. The antics at the bar, Violet's search for fame, her budding romance, and some downtimes make for a nice, comfy blend of drama and comedy. Actually, the mix of drama and comedy is just right and suits the pace of the film fairly well. As there is hardly a dull moment. <br /> Piper Perabo stars as Voilet Sanford. Perabo was awesome in this movie, as she perfected at pulling off Violet's innocent yet strong-willed personality. Adam Garcia plays Violet's love interest, and gives enough charm and wit to make his character interesting and likable. John Goodman is here as Violet's father, and has some pretty good moments. Preferably at the end. The Coyote girls were all excellent in their parts. Even though they were sort of stereotyped nothing ever fell out of place. And don't think that Tyra Banks has a big part here. Her onscreen time is probably less than 10 minutes. But she shines when she's there.<br /> With it's perfect blend of comedy, drama, good performances, and fun bar scenes - Coyote Ugly is a perfect feel good, inspiring movie.
0446310786|5.0|this book is wonderful.  it was slow in the begginning, but got better and better.  I went into thinking how awful it was going to be because it is a classic.  I was wrong.  This is the best classic book i have ever read.  It is a very quick read that is hard to put down.
B0000636UN|4.0|I have been a fan of Sheryl Crow's since Tuesday Night Music Club.  I don't think &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is as strong lyrically or musically as previous records.  On her previous cds, her lyrics were serious, smart, refreshing and heartbreaking.  It seems with &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; the approach was to a breezy and fun rock record.  But what is wrong with that?  I say nothing! There are some good songs on this cd.  My favorite songs on the cd are: Steve McQueen, Soak up the Sun, C'mon, C'mon, It's Only Love, Safe and Sound and Diamond Road. The guest vocals are great because they mostly sing on the chorus with Sheryl.  I don't like it when a cd is filled with guest vocalists and you don't get to hear the person that you bought the cd for.  The only song I could have done without is the Don Henley colloboration - It's So Easy - a bad easy listening tune. <br />She is one of the most talented singer-songwriters today.  Keep rocking Sheryl!  There aren't many of you out there.
0441003257|5.0|I'm not exactly sure how one goes about writing a book with someone else, but it sure as heckfire worked with these two authors.  I wouldn't be surprised if some might think this book slightly blasphemous or sacreligious, but me?  I think it's startlingly, humorously, perfectly irreverent.  These two authors managed to write a book about the very thing my parents have obssessed over to the point of instilling fear in me as a child and made it a matter to laugh at.  I doubt many people would say this, but it's been very beneficial to my life...to laugh at that which \\"ought not be laughed at\\".  As Martha Stewart might say, \\"It's a good thing.\\"
0060977493|5.0|I loved this book.  Really the type of book that changes you.  The story and the characters and the prose become part of you.  So finishing the book feels like a loss.  Beautifully written.  It is poetry.  I found the book to be laugh out loud funny sometimes and also deeply, deeply sad.  Read it!
B00004Z459|5.0|I just realize that there are a lot of linkin park haters out there but that's ok.  There has to be, it comes wit the terriotory.  A Good band will always have their critics but it's funny to me to hear people on hear giving their reviews, soundin off how awfully bad they are.  Meanin LP's music touches em in a way that makes em almost sound like they havin a fit writing a review.  Anybody who really likes good music and are open to it will at least respect linkin park's music and rest of the people who listen to LP are fanatics like me.  That's how good i think they are.  For those people catagorizing linkin park as a rock band they obviously don't know what they're talkin about.  If u own the linkin park dvd u know that they don't see themselves as a rock band but as a \\"new type of fusion\\" everybody needs to understand that and stop hating on them and listen to their music wit a open mind and at least appreciate it.  Me, personally it's the best band out there. All their songs kick ... It makes u wanna grind your teeth at wit chesters' goosebumplin skin crawlin vocals along wit a distinct sound, that of which is, linkin park.
B00005V0X5|2.0|I don't see what everyone sees in this re-release. First of all, the album was never that good to begin with. For the most part the whole album is generic thrash. Only Last Rites/Loved To Death and Mechanix stand out. Having demos of them WAS a good idea. Like so many others, I sure as [heck] wasn't pleased with the Emergency Broadcast System Remix of These Boots. AT LEAST HALF THE SONG IS BLEEPED, AND THE WORDS AREN'T EVEN BAD! And those early demo tracks? A good idea, BUT THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE! Aren't remasters supposed to REPAIR the quality of classic albums? And then there is the cover. It now looks like any \\"new metal\\" cover, complete with Parental Advisory logo. I don't see how anyone can like this album any more than Metallica's Kill 'em All. Early Megadeth was never too good, and here it shows, with poor songs and poor production quality. Someone call me when they put out a REAL remaster of this album. ...
B000066NW0|3.0|Ok.....Avril lavigne.....this aritst does obvoiuly have talent for her age. i think she has a good voice..but sounds alot like alanis. her writing skills are mediocre. But there are things i dont like about her.  she says she is a true skater punk girl....hmm......i think she is trying to fit her self in the cliched &quot;punk&quot; thinking all punks skate or all skaters listen to punk. no...she says ohh im punk...oh yea let me tell you..her songs are soo punk..there so poppy britney spears coudl sing them..and theres some rock ones..but STILL POP POPPY guitar songs.....i doubt she skates.......her skateboard looks like its never been touched...no scratches or nothing....i think he has osiris' D3....haha...thats funny but they suite her....shes jsut antoher manufactured artist...i feel sincerly bad for her...now because she is going to be the next teen idol for all the little teeny boppers ....damm..thanks to her..do you know how many posers theres going to be!??! and there are going to think this is what true skaters and punks are...how sad. ughhh....she is truly the defention of a POSer...but im not completely dissing her...i think she has talent in signing abotu thats it. Her songs were fairly good.  but i dont think they even catorgize under pop punk...blink182 is pop punk...which many girls think their the&quot;hardcore punk&quot; try listening to operation ivy lol. they are def bubble gum pop with a few pop rock kinda !

THIS VERSION doesn't include the  &quot;full&quot; theatrical film but rather the mutilated for  older TV version.Universal should be ashamed,
B000001EMW|4.0|Incredible. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that, like some of the other reviewers, I have heard both of their newer CDs, and I think that each one improves on the last.<br />These guys are geniuses. The way they play, it seems perfectly natural for rock to be played on cellos. We need more of this. Cello rock should become an entire genre. It just works so well.<br />I think the high point of this CD is the quiet part in Master of Puppets. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but I think that section (just the quiet part) actually improves on the original.<br />Overall, the best song on this CD is The Unforgiven, which is infinitely better than the original. The original really wasn't that good (I actually found it kind of annoying), but Apocalyptica completely transformed it into a true masterpiece. This is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have EVER heard.<br />Buy this CD, then Inqisition Symphony, then Cult. That way you get the most out of each CD, since each one is better than the last. And it's cool to hear them evolve from a Metallica tribute band to an actual band (Cult is almost all original, with just two Metallica covers and a really awesome version of Hall of the Mountain King, a classical piece).
0060987464|5.0|Before i read this book I was a fan of Marilyn Manson, but after reading it I feel I have become a lot bigger fan. If you want to know any useful stuff about MM then this is the book for you, it is wellwritten, exciting, disturbing, touching and surprising at once. Even if you're not a fan this book is going to help you, and I guarantee you after reading this book you will have a whole different view on Marilyn Manson. Of course if you're not interested in MM then this book is obviously not for you, but if it is, then what are you waiting for? Buy!
B000067CPX|4.0|This is easily the rock cd of the year. There isn't one bad song on this album. This album is their best yet; the most creative, melodic, original, lyrically-developed, and dynamic. It is even better than Californication, which had one or two bad songs. This album is destined to be one of the all-time greatest rock albums; up there with \\"Are You Experienced?\\", Zeppelin's \\"IV\\", and the Stones' \\"Sticky Fingers\\".
B000068QVN|5.0|This CD is a wonderful testament to the power of early GFR. I will give a track by track review.<br />1. The introduction first has the fans chanting We Want Grand Funk then the recorded Sprach Zarathustra (2001) come on and stops and an announcer says. Welcome, Closer To Home, Grand Funk Railroad.<br />2. Are You Ready-Rocking version equal to Live album but faster paced.<br />3. Footstompin Music, this must be the survival version it is different than the regular version and really its like Footstompin Music on steroids. This one has a loner intro before the singing, it starts off with Don on Drums by himself and then Mel comes in and then Finally Mark on Keys. Its really cool. It is heavier then the normal Footstompin music. When Mark gets on the guitar he starts off like the normal guitar lick but then changes it up to sounds like a bit of inneed, it rocks. Mark's guitar is feeding back real easy so it must have been on eleven.<br />4. Paranoid-This version is real similar to Live album except Marks guitar playing is better, more crisp. Mark is on Fire on this one. I give this version a slight lead over the live album version.<br />5-6-7.-Medley I'm Your Captian/Hooked On Love/ Get it together. each song has a CD break (Unheard of course) so there song 5, 6 and 7 but its a medley. I mush prefer this medley to having mean mistreater on the CD. IYC starts off like the Caught in the act version at first but then Mark comes in with some cool chicken scratch guitaring and then they come to an end and start up IYC like the album version. Mark seems to sing in a lower key then normal (ever so slightly) which sounds cool, Mark and Dons harmonies are great as usual. About half way through the normal version then changes in a short rendition of Hooked on Love and then changes into Get It together. Really cool stuff.<br />8. T.N.U.C. -WOW 16 plus minutes the best version of the Drum solo I ever heard. Don is on Fire on this one. Totally Rockin version, at the 10 minute mark, Mark shouts everybody help us out, Mark and Mel hop on the drums as well. Drum thing 71 style.<br />9. Inside Looking Out-15:30 version Mark dedicates the song to all the people in Washington for you and me, and for everyone out that that smokes..... Similar version to one on Anthology, but better, its faster. Mel is just on fire on this one, he is throughout every song on the disk. This CD is so bass heavy its like all the music revolves around Mel's bass playing. It should be called Mel Funk Railroad Live in 1971. Marks guitar work rules on this one, it is much like the anthology version but better, Mark is very bluesy, then he is on fire, in a glorious feedback frenzy. This was what GFR was all about baby. There is even extra juice on the harmonica part. Then it ends in a distorted feedback frenzy. And the fans chant Grand Funk, Grand Funk. This is probably the best power trio version ever. But I will have to give it some time to be sure.<br />10. Gimme Shelter- (First encore)  Kick but POWER TRIO version. Mark cooks, Mel Cooks, Don Cooks then all cook. Don sings it in a powerful way (and Mark does as well), Don and Mark's harmonies rule. 7 plus minute version. Don is just pounding his drums as he sings, incredible. Mark starts at the half way point to go nuts on the guitar and rips off some fast playing. Then Mark holds a long distorted note and GFR keeps it going as they bring the song back up. And then Mark comes back in again with some home cooking fast frenzy guitar playing, then into all kinds of stuff-wait until you hear it. Easily the best GFR version ever.<br />11. Into The Sun- (final encore) the cool long version. Much the same type of version like Live album; but not all the lopped audience noise tracked over Marks guitar, this version beats live album hands down. Much clearer thren live album, and Mark is ON FIRE! Mel is ON FIRE. Don is on FIRE. But this is Mark's song to shine and he is shinin on baby.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I admit, when I first heard about Pink and Can't Take Me Home, I did not like her. But then in one year she really changed, and really amazed me. She changed her looks, her sound, and her style. My favorite album is M!ssundaztood, my fave song is Respect, and I'm a guy!! If I were a parent, I would approve of the way she dresses but dissaprove of all her cursing. Although I don't think Missundaztood is any worse than CTMH. I mean, Can't Take Me Home had a Song called H-E-L-L Wit Ya! I think Pink should Probably lose the negative attitute, but I love  Missundaztood and hope to see Ms.Alecia Moore for many years to come.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is the best movie EVER and I can't wait getting the DVD. It's worth seeing over and over again! It should not be rated PG-13. Anyone can enjoy it!
0316666343|5.0|I purchased this book on a tip from a friend that this was going to be a must summer read. It surely didn't disappoint. I could not put it down. I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happened next. It really gave an interesting perceptive on what haven would be like. Also, that the people we leave behind are never really alone because, our spirit is always there to guide them.
B00005UW9T|5.0|I am 14 and I still love to watch Anastasia! I know all the words to the songs and the things the charachters say. If you are hesitating about buying this DVD, get it! its the best movie you'll ever buy.
0385335482|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  I read it in one day because I just couldn't stand to put it down.  The author uses subtle wit to make the story fast paced and fun.  I'm in the middle of the sequel Shopaholic takes Manhattan which is also amazing, and has the same page turning flow.
0140386335|5.0|I love this book! I've seen the movie, and it was horrible! For one, it stops half way through, and skips key parts that make the story more interesting. <br />The book starts when a not-so-heroic boy named Bastian runs into a book shop to escape some bullies, when he happens upon the Neverending Story. Bastian retreats to the forgotten attic of his school and begins to read. Bastian is swept into the magical world of Fantastica, which is in great danger...<br /> My favorite character is Grogroman, the Many-Colored Death of the Desert of Colors(not in the movie). Michael Ende is one of the most imaginative authors I've read(and I've read quite a bit). This is a must-read book you have to have!
0312265859|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum books and wait eagerly for each new one. I have to say that this one was disappointing. Still a page-turner, but disappointing.<br />Hard Eight is not as laugh out loud funny as previous outings. Evanovich moved away from some of the old reliable elements in this book -- the massive destruction of cars, visits to the funeral home, Grandma Mazur -- but what she gives us instead is simply not as funny.<br />The plot -- never a really strong point in these books -- seems particularly thrown together here. And, it seems that Evanovich loses interest in it just as we have and the book just stops. Tantalizing possibilities are not pursued.<br />The characters feel sketched in this book, as if Evanovich is counting on what we know from previous books and is counting on us to fill in the outlines.<br />The whole thing just seems flat.<br />This is a great series. Start at the beginning and enjoy the ride.<br />I'm looking forward to the 9th book.
6303824382|5.0|The heat is on again as Bruce Willis plays Detective John McClane battling a very intelligent mastermind through out the streets of New York city.  In NY, there has been a bomb explosion and the man responsible wants John McClane in this case for some reason.  It seems that the main villain in this movie is known as \\"Simon\\" (Jeremy Irons)but is really the brother of Hans Gruber, the villain in the first Die Hard, who seeks revenge on McClane.  Although that is what it seems, Simon's main goal is to steal truck loads of gold bars from the NY Federal Reserve Building.  Simon admits hiding a very large bomb in NY.  John and a Harlem dry cleaner, Zues (Samuel)L. Jackson go through wierd obstacles in order to find this bomb.   All die hard fans will love all the bomb explosions, fast car drivings, and gunshootings throughout this movie.  This is the best Die Hard throughout and I think anyone else would to if they get this.
B000002LCU|4.0|I miss him even more now. 'Cloud Nine' is full of punchy, poppy melodies punctuated both with George's sharp wit and loving patience, and both tunes and lyrics will stick in your head for a long time. Ringo is on there too, with his drums, and both George and Eric Clapton share virtuoso guitar licks on most tracks. Snappy horns add crackle to many tracks. There is not a bad song on this record, but my favorites are 'This is Love'  (available in a wonderful instrumental version on the 'Everest' IMAX soundtrack) 'Devil's Radio,' 'Fish on the Sand' and 'Wreck of the Hesprus.' Even 'Just for a Day' sounds like something Paul did fifteen years later musically, so kudos to George for getting it right the first time.<br />However, my major beef with this record is that the fingerprints of the ever-annoying Jeff Lynne are smeared all over the place. For a man whose band, ELO, shamelessly imitated the Beatles, I am amazed George even gave him the time of day, let alone production responsibilities. And was it really necessary to allow him to sing backup (barely backup - more like almost side-by-side) on virtually every song? I find this horribly distracting. It sounds like a parody of a parody of the original at times. George sounds wonderful, but it would have been more accurately described as 'George Harrison and Jeff Lynne/'Cloud Nine.' I will always be curious as to how this record would have sounded without Mr. Lynne's input, and send the current version out the window upon replacement. But at this point, I take George even in this adulterated form.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Gosford Park seemed like the type of movie that I would really enjoy. A murder mystery set in the 1930's. Kind of like Clue but with a bigger budget and less comedy. Unfortunately, I found myself falling asleep because I had no clue what was going on. I honestly know no more about the movie now than I did before I watched it. If you were to ask me what the movie was about, I would say some people came to a big house, someone was murdered, the people left. And you do not have to worry about me spoiling the ending because I do not know who the killer was. I understood that several characters had motives, but I did not understand why. I am not sure if the murderer was revealed or if he or she was not intended to be revealed.<br />Here were my main difficulties with the movie. First, most of the characters had thick British accents and the sound was not done well at all. There was always too much background noise. Therefore, even if I could hear the dialogue, I could not understand it. Second, there were too many characters and the movie kept jumping from one to another very quickly, so I had no idea who was who and how they were related to the other characters. <br />These difficulties left me watching the end credits rolling with disbelief. The movie just seemed to end, leaving no closure. I can only assume that this is the type of movie that you need to watch at least a couple of times in order to completely understand it. I rented this movie so I really do not have much motivation to spend the time or the money to watch it again.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is the first Mingus CD I picked up, and it won't be the last.  The quality of the songwriting is the strongest part of the album.  The playing is excellent, but it's the songs that shine.
B00005JLDW|4.0|2020 A.D.  The world's cities have been turned to ash, and humanity reduced to isolated pockets of lean survivors.  The legends were true:  dragons did exist, and only awaited the right time to emerge from their subterranean hibernation.  Caught totally unawares, Man has all but succumbed to the dragons' tooth and claw.<br />A story of survival against the odds, \\"Reign of Fire\\" is a great action-FX showcase that rises above its B-movie roots thanks to a serious, surprisingly character-driven script and several outstanding performances.  Christian Bale is great as the leader of England's last clique of humans, and Matthew McConaughey is the intense, scene-chewing soldier who proves to Bale that the dragons can be defeated.  Izabella Scorupco lends the film some patrician sex appeal as a daring chopper pilot under McConaughey's command.  Director Rob Bowman is also smart not to overdo the dragons' screen-time--only seen when necessary, the dragons retain an awesomeness and mystery than might have been dulled by repetitive showing.  Not that they don't stand up to scrutiny:  the artificial beasts are perfectly convincing when they do show up.<br />Though not deep, \\"Reign of Fire\\" is at least not pretentious, either.  And for any sci-fi or fantasy fan, it's surely worth the trip to the theatre.  Easily recommended.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of the Peppers' greatest albums because the lineup with Frusciante peaks, and Rick Rubin's clear production lets the music shine.  The album starts off real strong, hits some radio-ready tunes (with Under the Bridge and Give It Away), hits a little filler, and then closes strong.  Flea's bass playing is never as good as it is on this album.  He slows down a little from Mother's Milk and lets the funk come through.
B000067CPX|5.0|When I first heard that John Frusciante had rejoined the Chili<BR>Peppers I was thrilled. But by the time that 'Californication'<BR>had been release, I was decidedly mixed about that album. While it's true that there were a few great songs on that album,<BR>'Californication' just never really grabbed me, I didn't feel that it completely gelled. While I appreciated RHCP's progression<BR>as songwriters, that album, production and preformance wise just fell flat. So with some reservation I picked up the new album,<BR>'By The Way'.<br />Was I ever floored with this album, my jaw just dropped after<BR>hearing the first three songs. From that point onward, my jaw just stayed open all the way through the rest of the album. I had<BR>a smile on my face that never went away. 'By The Way' without a doubt may be the best RHCP's since 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic'. Now I know that some of the older chili pepper's fans my be disapointed with this album. It doesn't have the punk funk aggression of 'Mother's Milk' or 'Uplift Mofo Party Plan', but it<BR>has a great balance of all of the different styles and shades that RHCP are known for. I saw a few negative comments from a few<BR>others that I felt were a bit much, the Peppers have not become<BR>another 'Train' as someone suggested.<br />The title cut is a great opener, some of the other highlights for me are 'Universally Speaking, Don't Forget Me, I Could Die For You' is in a similar vein to 'Under The Bridge', I think 'Midnight' has to do with Sept 11th and it's a great, powerful song. 'Cabron, Tear, On Mercury' are the three biggest surprises. 'Venice Queen' is a great, hypnotic album closer. I want to stress that this is a great album overall, strong opening, great middle and great closer. The use of various Keyboards and textures really add to the album. Anthony Keidis's vocal style has really evolved. The vocal harmonies show just how much they have evolved as songwriters. Even Fleas trumpet makes an appearance.<br />For myself, Ifind that the best albums always come when Musicians focus on writing well developed songs as opposed to<BR>flashy riffs. It's Ironic, but the reason that RHCP have remained<BR>relevant, is the very thing that some older fans of the band have complained of, because they have chosen to grow up and out of the 'Mother's Milk' phase of their career.
B000067CPX|4.0|From the start, the Chili Peppers were a punk-funk group.  Their sound and lineup changed over time, but most dramatically with &quot;Californication&quot;.  On that disc, the group learned how to sing, and how to write better songs.  The surprise is that instead of taking the newfound singing ability and going into a &quot;Red Hot Wind &amp; Fire&quot; direction, they went more into a &quot;Red Hot Eagles&quot; sound, with a lot of strummy guitar playing.  &quot;By The Way&quot; continues the laid-back strummy sound to a greater degree.  Only the title track sounds like it might have come from an earlier Chili Peppers disc.  There are only a few ballads here - it's a quiet disc, but not a slow one.  The instrument playing is a little bit of a disappointment - I am sure better guitar, drum, and bass parts could have been made for some of the songs.  Granted, the Peppers' don't have to wail away like on &quot;Johnny Kick A Hole In the Sky&quot; (from Mothers Milk) on every song, but I would have appreciated hearing a little more of their virtuousity shine through.
0446608955|5.0|Just so ya'll know where I'm coming from, I'm 16 and a strong Christian. I have to admit that I had never heard of Nicholas Sparks until I saw the preview for the movie &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;. After I saw the movie I had to read the book. In regards to the book, it's wonderful, very sweet and sad at the same time. I'll read it forever. Don't expect it to be like the movie, they had to tone down the Christianity for the movie and it is set in a different time. They are both wonderful in the same way but they are very different. This book is great from pre-teens to older people because everyone remembers their first innocent romance. Make sure that if you are even slightly prone to tears that you have a box of tissues near-by.

0738206679|5.0|Every good song has a hook--a line or a melody that makes you want you to hear more.  For me the hook that kept me reading \\"Linked\\" appears on page 6. \\"Here is a secret that never makes the headlines\\" writes the author Barabasi, a professor of physics at Notre Dame, \\"We have taken apart the universe and have no idea how to put it back together.  After spending trillions of research dollars to dissassemble nature...we are just now acknowledging that we have no clue how to continue -- except to take it apart further.\\"<br />Could the prevalent reductionism be, at this point, obscuring rather that sharpening our vision of the the world?  Should we give up on the idea of having an equation that could be printed on a tee shirt that contains the Theory of Everything?<br />Barabasi's answer is not to stop analyzing, but rather to analyze certain relatively large self organized systems topologically over time, as if you were reading successive maps of a growing cosmopolitan region. As roads, building complexes, public areas and the like are added, the rules generating the growth and distribution of facilities make themselves plain. The network thus formed works in a manner that obeys certain laws (called power laws)and divides into highly connected places called hubs which link to less numerously connected nodes.  Using this analytical approach, he poses and answers dozens of questions that should stimulate an intelligent reader into seeing the world a little differently.<br />In fact, much of this book's interest derives from the activity of charting itself.  Barabasi, like some latter day Henry the Navigator, explains in ordinary language why Kevin Bacon is really not very central to the Hollywood map and how the late Rod Steiger was. How Microsoft follows the same laws as a strange sort of matter. He explains how Vernon Jordan got so many corporate board seats, what may be the best way to eradicate AIDs, and what may become the newest phamaceutical approaches to disease.Terrorist networks, cancer and bad economics may all one day fall victim to strategies derived from network analysis.<br />I have read too many popular science books to know that translating equations into popular literature is no easy feat.  So many fall of their very lack of weight. My one complaint with this highly readable book is that in an effort to make the book gallop the author has taken some shortcuts which break the flow of the argument.  Nonetheless, if you want to read a very good book about a scientific issue not many of us are familiar with, this is a very good one.

B0000640VN|5.0|hugh jackman steals the show! this movie will leave you feeling good, light and dreamy. i thought that the whole cast did a terrific job. the movie's only shortcoming was the abrupt ending, in my opinion but, otherwise, it is still a wholesome film to watch. so what if there were historical inaccuracies on the film! the bottom line, it is still a very entertaining film. i recommend the DVD version.
0060090383|5.0|When I first started this book, I didn't think I was going to like it - the setting seemed like sort of a downer. But the characters quickly become interesting and Rachel's situation becomes more and more realistic. I would strongly recommend this book for a summer read (or any other time!). I have yet to read a book by Marian Keyes that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.
038533558X|5.0|Harlan Coben's latest effort has a plot very reminiscent of his previous book, Tell No One, with shades of the popular Myron Bolitar series.  Similar to Tell No One, Gone for Good's narrative focuses on a protagonist, Will Klein, who is under suspicion by law authorities in the disappearance and death of a loved one. Will,like Myron Bolitar, has a close friend (the rich and mysterious Squares) who assists him in his search for the truth and to clear himself of any wrongdoing.<br />As in all of Coben's earlier works there are are peripheral characters from both sides of the law who complicate matters for the hero.  One of the most interesting is Ghost, who appears to be a very dangerous killer, but who has some surprises up his sleeve.  Ghost's relationship to Will Klein, Will's missing brother (an accused murderer), and Will's father is the hingepoint of the novel,and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat everytime he pops up in the plot.<br />Although followers of the the Bolitar sereies may find the latest Coben novels, including Gone for Good, too dark for their taste, the more realistic complex characters and driving plot lines provides for a richer reading experience.

0316666343|5.0|I got this book for a bit of light summer having no idea how good it would be. After the first chapter I decided I liked the book. After the second chapter, well after the second chapter I got hooked and finished the book. The book draws you into it. You can see every setting, feel every emotion. I have never read any of Alice Sebold's books before but I congradulate her on this book. It truly makes you feel like you are part of the story. If you do not like sad books or books that have a variety of emotions please don't read this book.

The obstacles the characters go through were hard and real.  Overall, there was much to like about the movie.<br /> Although it was a great movie, there a very few flaws we<BR>noticed.

6305910340|4.0|What if you were one of the best kid players at chess in the U.S.?  It started off pretty unusually for you.  You learned chess so quickly by simply watching people play in the park.  Now, people are saying that you play like Bobby Fischer, who was one of the most amazing chess players ever.  What would you be like if this was happening to you?  This is what occurs in the movie, Searching for Bobby Fischer.<br /> This movie had a great plot, and it also had a super screenplay. The characters were interesting.  Some of the acting of the scenes was excellent.  It really made sense how the characters developed.  The climax was intriguing and the denouement was satisfying.  There was some humor in it, too.<br /> There were also some little flaws in the film.  Some parts were upsetting.  There was not a lot of action in this film.  This movie may not be so good for kids that are younger than 7 years old because they may not understand it.<br /> We recommend Searching for Bobby Fischer to kids and adults. However, if you like action a lot, then you wouldn't really be interested in this movie.  We liked it through the whole movie and we hope you enjoy it, too.
B000002KHG|5.0|I discovered Van Morrison by accident; I was surfing the Internet and a website had Moondance playing when I surfed in....I asked a friend of mine (who is a musician) to tell me who the artist was, and was amazed when he said it was Van Morrison......I remember hearing his music when I was a teen way back in the 70's, and \\"Brown-eyed Girl\\" is one of my favorite 'crank up the radio and sing along' tunes...I bought the CD and am hooked....every song is filled with magic, and I could (and have) listen to this CD over and over and never tire of it. 'Moondance' is such a sexy song, about lovers and love and desire, 'crazy love' is fun, exciting and sexy, 'Dreams of You' is soulful, an so is 'Into the Mystic'. Listen to this CD with your lover, slow dance, hold each other close, and re-acquaint yourselves with each other while Morrison serenades to you. And, I recommend listening to it while wearing headphones to be able to listen to the horns and guitars in the background and to get the full strength of Morrison's magic.  Van Morrison is the best.

But Ava Gardner was magnificent, she was sexy and beautiful.  Grace Kelly was great for the role as the married gal.  Clark Gable was of course the hunk that everyone loves!  The film keeps you in your seat from the first scene to the last.  Just watch it, you'll love it!
B00005T7I1|3.0|1990's Dick Tracy tells about how Dick Tracy tries to get bad guy, Big Boy Caprice.  There things to enjoy about the film, but it is flawed.<br />   There are many good things from the movie, Dick Tracy.  There are great visual choices that make it look like the comic strip.  The colors were very cartoonish.  They used a few specific colors in only certain bright shades.  The matte paintings made the backgrounds look cartoonish, too.  The makeup for most of the villains made them look just like they do in the comic strip.  The lighting made the set look more real without looking too real, and the set wasn't really real either.  The musical score sounded like films of the 1940's, and the songs in the soundtrack sounded jazzy like 1940's music.  These choices were made because the comic strip came out in the 40's.  There was a great amount of action in the movie.  Also, there were funny parts.<br />   Although there were very good parts of Dick Tracy, we saw some very big flaws.  The movie does not have a strong plot at all.  It was confusing and hard to follow sometimes.  There were guns and fighting, but at least there was no gore.  There was minimal character development, but this was not a character piece; it was based on a comic strip.   Children under the age of six may not like this film because of the guns and they may not understand it.<br />   We recommend Dick Tracy, but not strongly.
B00005JKTF|5.0|CHARLOTTE GRAY is a much maligned movie, perhaps due to the fact that we are actively in a war state at present, a war state that is grossly dissimilar from the tenor of WWII.  But whatever criticisms that may be laid at the doorstep of this fine little movie are quickly overcome by the visual beauty of the photography (have fields of lavendar in Southern France ever been so lushly captured/painted by a photographer?, etc) and most importantly by the performances by a cast of excellent actors.  Cate Blanchett is certainly one of the most versatile and accomplished actresses on the screen today.  Her commitment to this role of a Scottish woman who joins the French Resistance because of her love of a pilot and develops into a true believer in the plight of the invaded French people is a tour de force of natural acting.  Billy Crudup continues to grow in stature as an actor and Michael Gambon raises the level of distinguished performances. Yes, this film tugs at the heart a bit....is that bad now?  War creates abrupt changes in people and results in permanent alterations of places and psyches, and the various subplots of CHARLOTTE GRAY make a strong point of this fact. See this film and decide for yourself.
B00005T7I1|3.0|1990s Dick Tracy is based on the 1940s comic strip.  It tells a story of Dick Tracy and how he helps people by fighting villain, Big Boy Caprice.  It is exciting but flawed. <br />Some things in Dick Tracy were good.  There was a lot of action.  The character of Dick Tracy had most of the action.  All the actors did a super job.  Warren Beatty gave a great performance as Dick Tracy and he was also a terrific director.  He helped make the movie look like the comic strip with some interesting visual choices.  He used bright shades of certain colors, and those were the only shades he used in the movie.  The villains wore freaky makeup so they would look like the real villains in the comic strip.  Beatty also made things look and sound like the 1940s because that was when the comic strip was taking place.  He used cars from the 1940s.  The musical score which was composed by Danny Elfman, sounded dramatic like 1940s films.  The songs from the musical soundtrack sounded jazzy like the 1940s music.  Madonna, who was also in the movie, sounded excellent when she sang the songs.  The character of The Kid added a lot of humor.<br />This movie did not have that many flaws, but they were big ones.  There was not much of a plot.  In the beginning of the movie, it did not make a lot of sense.  We had trouble understanding what people were saying sometimes, especially the villains.  The characters were not well-developed, but that was okay for this film because it was based on a comic strip.  There were a lot of guns, but at least we didnt see any gore.  Children under the age of six might not like this movie.<br />We are recommending this movie, but we only think its okay.  The action and cool visual choices were not enough to make up for the lack of plot.  It was fun to watch, but not so great.
B000000W6F|5.0|Certainly there is a lot you can say about how Gish ISN'T the Pumpkins' best work, but there is one aspect in which it stands above the others: bass.  In Siamese Dream the bass largely seems to get lost amongst the guitars (not that you can't hear it, but it seems to be kept pretty simplified - just backing the chords mostly).  And in Mellon Collie, the focus switches to all sorts of unusual effects and electronics, and bass is again left in the background.  But Gish is different, Gish actually has a lot of interesting bass lines and songs centered around bass (at least for parts of them).  <BR> All this said, I'm really a guitar man at heart, I just thought the observation was interesting.  Though I DO recommend the album.  Not for the new fan maybe - start with Siamese Dream (song-for-song their best album) and then probably experience the diversity, creativity and sheer prolific-output the Pumpkins are capable of with Mellon Collie.  But if you like those albums, you'll like Gish, or at least you should.  The same great songwriting is at work, the same brand of touching, emotional lyrics, it just has been fully refined yet.  <BR> Okay I'm gonna sidetrack a bit hear, so no need to read on if you're only interested in Gish.  I just wanted to say something about where I think the Pumpkins stand in the overall scheme of things.  They probably are my favorite band, but I also like a lot of other highly (and even not so highly) regarded bands, so I feel qualified to make objective commentary.  First of all, a lot of reviewers seem to classify the Smashing Pumpkins as grunge.  In my mind, they're really not.  They just don't have that grungy sound, even when they use distortion, even if they were from the same time period.  Their sound is pretty unique - part of it is Corgan's voice, of course, which is truly one-of-a-kind, but it's also their songwriting - it's just too diverse a mix to catagorize under any one genre (other than the rock genre).  And yes, like a lot ofother Pumpkins fans, I DO think the Pumpkins were better than Nirvana in terms of band of the '90s (also better than the great Pearl Jam who I personally rate higher than Nirvana...neither band maybe had the same influence or effect on pop-culture especially given Kurt's death, but MUSICALLY they both wrote better songs and more consistent albums).  In fact, the only band I would really put up their close to the Pumpkins in terms of 90's bands is Radiohead.  The Pumpkins and Radiohead both rise above the competition for one basic reason - they put genuine emotion into their songs - in the music, in the words, and in the WAY the words are sung...no other band moves me as much as these two - the Pumpkins with their earnest poetry about feelings I can relate to, and Radiohead with a ... singer who is out of this world.
B00003CWTI|5.0|In Magnolia, writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson has created a modern cinematic masterpiece.  Entertaining, grand, operative, introspective are all adjectives that describe this film.  At first glance, Magnolia appears to be singularly about the way that family members interact with each other in the face of coincidence, but like all great works of art, Magnolia encompasses many different subjects within its intricate weave: television, the relationships of men and women, and most emotionally, love.  Writer/Director, Paul Thomas Anderson juggles all of these tonal and subject shifts with supreme artistry- granting each one its own unique emotional tone, subtle color scheme and style of directing, unlike Soderbergh's obvious ensemble directing in Traffic.  The Altman comparisons aren't unjustified, yet Magnolia is a wholly new and fresh filmic event and Anderson has created a style that is really all of his own. <br />Moments of grand operatic emotions fill the familial stories of Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) a dying TV mogul with an estranged son, sex guru, Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise) and a young trophy wife (Julianne Moore) who decides that, maybe she does in fact love Earl for his character and not his money.  An entirely new set of characters are introduced to their conncetion with Jimmy Gator, the 2nd patriarch of the movie-  the quiz show host of \\"What Do Kids Know.\\"  Like Earl, he's estranged from his child and dying of cancer, yet ends up less sympathetic than Earl.  Connected to Jimmy is his loving and loyal wife (Melinda Dillon) his various mistresses and his daughter, Claudia.<BR>    <BR>When the film shifts to the unsentimental love aspect of the film, the tone shifts but stays within the same artistic framework as the rest of the movie.  Jimmy's daughter Claudia (Melora Walters) a self-loathing coke addict meets Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) after playing her Aimee Mann CD too loud.  Jim sees something in her that she (and neither do we) noticefor most of the movie, till the satisfyingly offbeat conclusion, when her character has evolved from shrewish to sympathetic.  Each character is richly devised- seemingly real people with motivations and desires that are both sad and pathetic, but understandable.  Also in the mix of characters is Stanley Specter, a boy genius who feels the climactic pressure of earning money on the Jimmy Gator-hosted quiz show, \\"What Do Kids Know\\" for an ungrateful and mean-spirited father.<br />In a related storyline a former \\"WDKK\\" contestant, Donnie Smith, a man so lonely and desperate for love, spends the film trying to figure out of a way to get braces superfluous to him just to attract the attention of a vapid bartender.  His infinitely melancholic state of mind clings to any signs of idealism and innocence, which he lost after his parents stole his earnings and left him for broke.  His life was ruined and his dreams are petty, but don't expect Paul Thomas Anderson to laugh at him or make him out to be a lesser character, which Todd Solondz might do.  In Magnolia, there's a quiet and unsentimental redemption for all.<br />In addition to the rich and moving set of characters, screenplay, Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is brilliantly idiosyncratic.  He moves from flashy tracking shots which capture the tacky thrills of backstage television life to long still shots that let us focus on the characters and their conversation and not their faces or makeup.  At any rate, his directing is skillful, attentive, and appropriate for each scene.  If Paul Thomas Anderson set the seeds of genius in Boogie Nights, he sows them here.<br />The cinematography and production values are also top-notch and the DVD only enhances the beauty and crispness with which Magnolia was shot and edited.  The music works excellently too.  Aimee Mann's haunting songs appear during the hugely operatic parts (such as one scene where the entire cast joins together to sing \\"Wise Up,\\") while Jon Brion's poignant score builds a quiet tension that dramatically erupts during the \\"storm,\\" which is too good and surprising to give away.  <br />Despite that Paul Thomas Anderson has created a film this passionate, intelligent, and entertaining, still, Magnolia has left some viewers hating it, calling it \\"boring\\" or excessive because of its 3 emotionally and intellectually charged hours.    True there aren't car chases or one liners or constant exploitation of sexuality (like in \\"American Beauty\\"- a cardboard film which goes down the exact opposite path that Magnolia does).  There are no easy answers, and it doesn't dumb down its message as to condescend to the viewer, unlike 'Beauty'.  One cannot really make a judgement about this film without seeing it at least a second time.  To rush to a judgement after only one viewing is akin to looking at the Mona Lisa once and describing it as \\"ugly.\\"  If there is an age long debate about whether cinema is art or entertainment, Magnolia would affirm that it is both.  For it is studied, intricate, and creative, yet over time (if not instantly) entertaining and moving.  Magnolia is one of those few films that are released nowadays, in which it doesn't feel like the viewer is watching a product.  That alone sets it apart.  And Magnolia and Paul Thomas Anderson go beyond the average expectations and create a cinematic masterpiece, worthy of debate and repeated viewings.
6305546789|5.0|Everyone knows the plot by now and the movie itself is an obvious 5 in my opinion.  So, I will review the dvd presentation which is amazing.  Just the widescreen alone would have made the dvd well worth the price.  I've been so used to the full frame picture of this movie after years and years of repeated viewings that I was just blown away when I popped this in the dvd player for the first time.  You really miss a lot of the picture in the full frame format and this is made really apparent on the girls walk home from school.  For any crazy people that actually prefer a full frame picture that is also available.  The picture and sound are astounding, a total viewing pleasure.  The featurette gives some interesting insight on the making of this classic movie as well.  You also get trailers, numerous radio and tv spots, and lots of stills.  Anchor Bay really got it right with this dvd and Halloween afecionados like myself couldn't be happier.  If you call yourself a Halloween fan and don't own this, buy it now!
0399226907|5.0|Our 2 year old son LOVES this book.  He likes the story, the artwork, and it quickly became one of his favorites.
6303282237|5.0|El Cid is the greatest medeval period movie ever made,barring none. Heston and Loren are at their best. 5 stars are not enough to rate this movie. I seen it in the movies in 1961,and have it on vhs. Its a must see. I rate this movie from 1 to 10, a 10 1/2
B000066NW0|4.0|Ouch.  I was reluctant to finish reading the other reviews that were written before mine.  I for one, am addicted to Avril's song &quot;Complicated&quot;.  I think it has a new catchy feeling to it. As for the so called punks who voiced their words so bravely before me, maybe shes not up to standards for 'your' punk scene, but she sure is starting up her own.  Avril's lyrics are unique and her voice is incredible.  If you want something a little different to listen to and to get you going in the morning... i recommend Avril's latest cd.
B00005QG9J|5.0|There are some excellent songs on this CD, which is much better than the breakthrough &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. I could just sit around and listen to Incubus all day. They have great guitar, nice melodies, just great music period. They are better than most nu-metal bands, and should be given another look by people who see them as the guys who do that &quot;Drive&quot; song. They are much more than that.
B00004R99J|5.0|Ok..so this movie isn't at all historically accurate. As the \\"outraged\\" Navajo woman stated, there was a HUGE age difference between the real Pocahontas and John Smith. If you read the biography of Pocahontas, you can find out the truths and untruths behind this Disney movie. The fact is, knowing Disney was going to do this movie should have let people know that it would be sugar coated and somewhat stereotypical. Explaining to a young child why a 40 year old would even be attracted to a 12 year old would be difficult. The basis of the story: John Smith and company arriving in Virginia in 1607 to find gold and then meeting with the Powhatan tribe, is there. Children can learn the disturbing treatment the Native Americans recieved later on in junior high and high school.  Disney does however let children know the value of talking out differences and seeing beyond color and outward differences to find what life and love are truly about. Not to be completely cliche, but, if nothing else, this movie does show children that it's what's inside that counts.<BR>If you want to see a historically correct portrayal of Pocahontas and John Smith...don't watch a Disney movie.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album proved that Metallica could write great music and lyrics without the help of the late Cliff Burton. I don't mean any disrespect at all but James and Lars knew what they were doing all along, they didn't need help. Anyways I will give a breif description of the songs and a rating for each one.<br />Blackened- A good song with a great intro. Great riffs but somewhat odd lyrics. 4/5<br />...And Justice For All- A beautiful acoustic intro. Great lyrics and great riffs. A great song in general. 5/5<br />Eye of the Beholder- An eerie song about society's downfall. Interesting lyrics and riffs. 4/5<br />One- A classic Metallica song with great solos. Uses the same formula as Fade to Black and Welcome Home (Sanitarium), the soft verse and heavy chorus and lighting-fast ending. 5/5<br />The Shortest Straw- A good thrash song with cool riffs. Probably the weakest track on the album though. 3/5<br />Harvester of Sorrow- Another classic Metallica song that is always on the setlist at concerts. Great chorus and the shortest song on the album next to Dyer's Eve. 5/5<br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity- Another weak track due to the fact that it is too long. A good thrashy song though. 3/5<br />To Live is to Die- A near 10 minute tribute to the late Cliff Burton. Beautiful melodys and great guitar work. A very good tribute song indeed. 5/5<br />Dyer's Eve- Probably the fastest song Metallica has ever done. Great lyrics and a great thrash song because it clocks in at 5:12. A perfect way to end the album. 5/5<br />So there you have it, ...And Justice For All only has 2 average songs and the rest are great. A great album from a great band. In my opinion, every one that is a heavy metal fan should own this album. That is my review of ...And Justice For All and I hope I have inspired some of you that don't have it to go out and get it.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|Okay, so I'm a sucker for romance and Ben Affleck, but aside from those two important parts of this film, I agree the action sequence is awesome. I'm not much for the \\"making of\\" the battle scene, because I really don't understand it anyways. But, I do think that for those people who enjoy that sort of thing and who liked the movie, this is your kind of DVD. The letterbox feature complete with 4 \\"collectible\\" postcards, a weathered excerpt of FDR's speech as well as the DVD extras like the \\"Journey to the Screen\\" and nurse's story make me give this DVD 4 out of 5 stars.
B00004Z459|5.0|this song rock the rap/rock album is awesome if you like metal rock or rap this is a must get.
0316666343|4.0|When I began this book, I admit I had a difficult time \\"getting into it\\" as I had just finished another book very different in tone.  About halfway through (and it reads quickly), however, I was sucked in.  I think what was hard for me was that you have to suspend disbelief in order to let the story draw you in.  But once it does...look out.  At the end I was both crying and cheering for Susie Salmon.  And I found myself thinking about this book days after I read the last page.  <br /> If I had to compare Alice Sebold to any other author, it would have to be Margot Livesy.  It reminded me of Livesy's \\"Eva Moves the Furniture\\" (also a great book).<br />I'm a public librarian and so I read as much as I can not just for my own pleasure--but to know what to recommend to my patrons.  This book is a must-read.
B000067CPX|5.0|DO NOT buy this album if you are expecting a purely funky album such as 'Freakey Styley' or 'Uplift Mofo Party <BR>Plan'. This album is a major contender for best Chili Pepper's album EVER - it takes Californication to another level. It is funky, it is mellow, it is simply 4 of the best modern rock musicians in the world at their very very best! If you liked 'Under the Bridge' and others, you will love this album.<br />This album is just superb. Songs like 'By the Way', 'Can't Stop', 'Minor Thing', 'Don't Forget Me' and 'Universally Speaking' are enough to send a shiver down the listeners spine they are so crisp and good!<br />5 out of 5 without a doubt!
0812550706|5.0|This book is without doubt one of the great science fiction books, without all of the stuff you don't want to hear! It takes you into the life of a young boy, nicknamed Ender, who quite literally has the world depending on him. I felt strongly for Ender, he was more than a character in a book to me, but that I can't explain. This is a must read, and I suggest it to everyone.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Yes, the soundtrack is great, but it left me nostalgic for the movie. I'd recommend purchasing the movie instead. Sound without sight doesn't work for Moulin Rouge.
B00003CXAA|5.0|By far some of the best movies i have ever seen. Al Pacino, after seeing these movies, is in my eyes one of the best, if not the best actor of his era, and one of the best of all time. So often you find movies with a incredible first movie, then the sequels tend to end up horrible.... But not this series. All three are by far some of the best movies out there. These movies also involve some of the best casting i have seen. With Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and also Andy Garcia, who i think was well casted for the third movie. Maybe a little expensive to buy this set, but its definitely worth it. I would suggest this to anyone. Even if you arent interested in the mafia.
B00005YU1O|4.0|This movie is fun to watch when you are in a very theoretical and psychological mood.  It jumps from section to section of how people think, to why people think, to why even think.  The movie is kinda hard to watch, because of the background moving all the time, but you will get used to it.  It is a good movie to own if you want to weird out one of your friends or yourself.  I'd suggest renting it before you buy it, just on the fact that this movie is not for everyone.
B000002J27|5.0|After Gabriel departed and the words 'It's only knock and knowall but I like it...' drifted away with the end of 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway', a new Genesis was born.  Gone were the flute and the dry lyrical wit of Gabriel.  Now it was time for familiar backup vocalist Phil Collins and writer Tony Banks to take the stand.  And their first albumn, while different, more than stood its ground.  The whimsical parade of cartoons on the cover (my favorite Genesis albumn cover, by the way) point the way to an albumn of odd English whimsy.  There are essentially a pair of sonic trios and a pair tounge-in-cheek songs, so I'll deal with them by grouping rather than order.<br />The albumn starts off very strongly with one of the all-time best Collins-era songs, 'Dance on a Volcano'.  An energetic rock song driven by Hackett's guitar work and various peculiar sounds dropped in for effect, this fantasy song is an excellent lead-in to what will follow. It's catchy, proggy, varied, and overall very enjoyable.  'Squonk' is a decent song with an interesting fantasy storyline behind it, but for my it failed to grab my attention.  The rythm is nowhere near as captivating as 'Dance on a Volcano'.  The last song in this sonic trio is the albumn's final track, 'Los Endos', a wonderful quasi-intrumental that combines melodies from the two afformentioned songs and, in the end, throws in a few interesting references to 'Supper's Ready'.<br />To contrast these tree fairly loud songs we get a trio of sleepy, dreamy songs that differ strongly from Gabriel-era quiet.  There is no flute, but Hackett's acoustic guitar, Banks' keyboard and piano, and Collin's voice.  (Which works better than Gabriel's in these situations, I should add.)  First up is 'Entangled' a beautiful songs written with dry wit about the medical industry, ended by an abslutely gorgeous and mesmerizing intrumental segment.  The other two are more serious.  'Mad Man Moon', possibly my favorite song from the albumn, is a excellent dreamy fantasy song driven by Bank's piano melodies.  Last is 'Ripples', another entrancing 8-minute song about the loss of beauty with age.  (As depicted by the suprisingly poignant picture on the cover.)<br />Last of all we get 'Robbery, Assault and Battery' and the title track.  the former is the weaker of the two, with an attempt at a witty mini-play along the lines of 'The Battle of Epping Forest' that fails to achieve that success.  The title track is a reasonably catchy, witty song about alienation...  So to speak.<br />A highly reccomended albumn, one that stands alongside the last two Gabriel albumns in terms of quality.  After this and its successor, 'Wind and Wuthering', the quality of Genesis music would go on a downward spiral.  This is nearing the end, and its a very good ride.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Simply an unbelievable album - the most exquisite phrasings and thoroughly unique.  I first heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on the radio and was immediately mesmerized - it compelled me to run out and buy the CD - and the entire album actually lived up to expectations.  I opened a bottle of wine that night and played the CD for my husband - who promptly went out the next night, bought 3 more copies and gave them to friends.  This is the most captivating CD we have heard in a very long time...
B000002UA2|4.0|A must have for any real die hard floyd fan.
B00000DQSV|5.0|1986 was the year England's Fab Five was reduced to a trio.  Drummer Roger Taylor bowed out due to nervous exhaustion, and guitarist Andy Taylor walked out in a huff for a solo career. The remaining members (Simon LeBon, Nick Rhodes, and John Taylor)were left in a funk and were unsure what musical direction to take.  They decided to hook up with the ever-trusty Nile Rodgers, and the result is \\"Notorious,\\" the band's most rhythm-oriented disc to date.  The title track is near-flawless; never before has the group released a groove this tight and sedcutive.  Simon LeBon gives us a never-before-heard falsetto in the single \\"Skin Trade,\\" which features some guitar work that's unmistakably Nile.  Moreover, things get moody in the angelic \\"Winter Marches On,\\" and we're brought to the disc's closer, the stomping rokcer \\"Proposition.\\"  Did I fail to mention the group's forgotten and underrated single \\"Meet El Presidente?\\"  \\"Notorious\\" is a solid album from start to finish and represents a step towards musical maturity for the band.  Following the abrupt departure of two members, you have to give these guys credit for bouncing back with an impressive disc that doesn't disappoint.
B00005A46T|5.0|There is no words that can do justice for this album.  It is phenomenal.  Slipknot are 1000% pure, uncompromised aggression that will not be tamed, and they prove it on their third release simply entitled IOWA.  And when I say uncompromised aggression I mean it.  Have you ever been front row at one of their shows?  If not I strongly advise you get to one.  Back to the album.    With the combination of grindcore/death metal guitar riffs, the constant vibrations of three drummers, freaked out samples and turntables and the sheer brutality of the MAN, number 8, Corey Taylor, you will be blown apart at the kneecaps!  ...  I have two copies of it!  So get it MAGGOTS!  Or as Slipknot says \\"GET THIS OR DIE!\\"  Stay (sic).
B000002LE6|4.0|I hated \\"Lovesexy\\" when it first came out in the spring of 1988. Following the tremendous \\"Sign O the Times,\\" I thought \\"Lovesexy\\" was a big disappointment and was too quirky for my taste. But, as a stand-alone album, this CD is a fine effort that has its strokes of brilliance. Yes, there's the Top Ten \\"Alphabet St.,\\" but my singles of choice are the severely underrated \\"Glam Slam\\" and the beautiful yet underrated \\"I Wish U Heaven.\\" Other funked-up gems are the title track and \\"Dance On.\\" Prince never releases the album you'd expect him to make. He's always two steps ahead of the game and continues to challenge us with interesting material. Again, I didn't care for \\"Lovesexy\\" when it came out, but over the years it grew on me and it's now become one of my favorite Prince albums.
B000056N8X|3.0|To anyone who hasn't bought this film or seen it yet, are not missing much. I'm a fan of action films of low grade but this one dissapointed me alot. This is the third sequel to the classic highlander film and was only slightly better then the highlander 2 and 3. The flashbacks were inconsistant and choppy. They were not fluiant with the story and the contrast between the Connor McCloud in films 1 and 4 were night and day again. Endgame was not written to anyone who hadn't watched the series or the first film and that hurts it appeal to anyone new to the story. Its not a wonder this filmed bombed at the box office and it only appeales to die hard highlander fans. I say save your money and only rent it if this film intrigues you because this film is not that great and not worth watching over and over.  The main reason to rent it is to watch the torch being handed from Cristopher Lambert to Adrian Paul and informing you that there will be no more highlander films with Christopher Lambert starring in them.
B000002LHX|4.0|&quot;Batman&quot; is no instant classic like &quot;1999&quot; or &quot;Dirty Mind,&quot; but it's easily his most commercial and fun album since &quot;Purple Rain.&quot;  &quot;The Future&quot; gets the vibe right with its electro funk mixed with spoken samples from the movie.  &quot;Electric Chair&quot; merges amped-up guitars with a slammin' groove, while &quot;Partyman&quot; and &quot;Trust&quot; are catchy, uptempo numbers that sizzle with energy.  &quot;Batdance&quot; the album's Number One single, still sounds great: the song is a perky dancefloor number before the beat shifts after a couple minutes and becomes a seductive mid-tempo jam.  Despite its mainstream appeal, &quot;Batman&quot; is proof that you can sometimes crossover to the masses and still cross back to your musical roots.
B000066C1N|4.0|Finally, a new Bryan Adams album! At least, I thought it was. Actually it's a soundtrack and that has a rather big influence on the songs. So don't expect rough or hard rocksongs, but expect a collection of moody, well-written moviesongs. The only exception is track 4 &quot;Get off my back&quot; which could as well have been on one of his former albums. Nevertheless, there are a bunch of really nice songs which really capture the mood of &quot;Spirit&quot;. It's a very good soundtrack, but I would really love Bryan to record a rock-album next time.<br />Today Bryan performs at TW Classic (Werchter - Belgium), so I'm really looking forward to see him play some of these new songs.
B00004Z459|4.0|A lot of people here are complaining about this being \\"exactly the same\\" as bands likee Limp Bizkit. Well, I have a question: How come I love this CD and hate everything by Limp Bizkit (that goes for Korn too)?<BR>I think this is a good, solid CD. The best song on the CD is probably \\"Points of Authority\\" closly followed by \\"In The End\\" and \\"Crawling\\".<BR>it's hard to call them Limp Bizkit copycats after hearing songs like \\"Cure of the Itch\\" and \\"My December\\" (not on this CD).<BR>My only real complaint is that nearly every song as a similar plot: Guy has a bad girfirend.<BR>Now, that doesn't mean the music itself is entirly the same. <BR>Also, [it was] said that a lot of the songs on this CD are about basic things adolesants go through. I would like to say that they obviously didn't do any research because the youngest member of LP is around 23.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind isn't a bad movie, but neither is it a great movie.  Certainly, any one of Mulholland Drive, The Man Who Wasn't There, Gosford Park, Black Hawk Down, Monster's Ball or Memento were much better films, but as shown with Gladiator last year, Hollywood likes it formula and cliche films and doesn't reward anything more challenging.<br />The story behind A Beautiful Mind is interesting but, sadly, as with most Ron Howard films, the movie is superficial.  The darker side of Nash should have been part of the film because it would have reflected his life and his illness much better.  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the movie is that it may give some people the wrong idea about the world many schizophrenics live in and how serious schizophrenia really is.  Nash's achievements are very impressive but his schizophrenia is not nearly as serious as some others (unless the movie just left that out).  I've dealt with many schizophrenics and many are far less functional than Nash.  My brother-in-law is schizophrenic and 99% of the time he can't hear you talking for all the voices in his head.  Others that I've encountered through volunteer work suffer the same way.  This movie seemed to be trying to give the impression that schizophrenia can be conquered which may be the case for Nash but not for the more seriously mentally ill.  That demonstrates a lack of respect for the seriously mentally ill.<br />Regarding the acting, both Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly were fine but both performances were vastly over-rated.  Connelly's part was relatively minor and didn't give her a chance to show her best.  How did she beat Helen Mirren or Maggie Smith with this part?  A great mystery.  Russell Crowe was okay but much like Sean Penn's nomination, his nomination for Best Actor was undeserved.  Both copied much of their performance from other actors who did a far superior job - Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump.  Either or both of their nominations should have gone to Billy Bob Thornton whose performances in both Monster's Ball and The Man Who Wasn't There were far superior.  I really don't understand this great admiration people have for Russell Crowe at the moment.  He was great in The Insider but won a very undeserved Oscar for Gladiator, a mediocre movie with mediocre performances.  Anyone who has seen Pollock knows that the Oscar should have gone to Ed Harris hands down.<br />All in all, if you're at the video store and can't find anything to watch, this movie is a good way to kill a few hours but is not by any stretch of the imagination a great film so don't expect it to be.
B000068QY7|5.0|One of the best deliverings nowadays. Listen to some touchy tunes in Stop crying ur heart out and little by little... and live to the up beat of hindu times and better man... unfortunately the album is a bit short.<BR>Owning it is a must.
B000002I97|5.0|Earlier this week, a well known art collector from Toronto purchased a masters art work, \\"Massacare of the Innocents\\"by the Flemish artist Ruebens for a reported 75 million dollars making it the most [costly] painting to be auctioned off. It's truly amazing what becomes treasured and valued as it ages but if I were a betting man, I'd wager that John Prines songs will be worth a fortune some day. <BR>    I can easily hold him in the company of modern day poets like Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Lennon/McCartney. This gentleman has a way with taking any subject and creating a heartfelt song that will tell the story. John's songs have something for everyone and expose your emotions. I can get so wrapped up in singing along, that I can feel the tears well up in my eyes, the hurt in my heart and even the laughter in my soul. Few songwriters have made this impact on a personal level with each individual. <BR>      John Prine takes you from one story to another and leaves you with different feelings each time. Humorous outings like llegal Smile\\", \\"Spanish Pipedream\\", and \\"Your Flag Decal won't get You int Heaven Anymore\\" are enough to lift you from the anguish of \\"Sam Stone\\" and the lonliness of \\"Hello in There\\". This is a small piece of John Prines work but it's destined to be a classic. If I had the chance, I'd invest in Johns songs because one day, they will be considered masters
B000066NW0|5.0|OMG~ Avril Lavigne is a very good musician for someone her age!!! She seems to know what she wants with her music. Though some of the song lyrics could be better... i still rate this a 5!!! I recomend this to anyone!!!
B00003CXDD|4.0|Take your basic good versus evil story, you know, the one where a prophesied infant's birth will bring peace and safety to the world; add in a nice set of plot twists, and you have Willow.  Willow takes the simple story and makes it fresh and new by making the hero an very unlikely person ... a dwarfish farmer (the race is refered to as elvins in the movie).  It has all of the great things (heroes, villans and magic) that you see a fantasy movie for, and wraps it up in a package that is a thoroughly enjoyable romp.  My kids loved it except for the beginning where the evil queen was trying to find the promised child ... they said that was a little scary, and they are 11 and 12.  [Just a note for you parents.]
B000066F6H|5.0|Veni Vidi Vicious, a 12 song masterpiece.  The Hives, swedish punk warriors, come to america with a high powered, fast, catchy, and beautifully made album.  led by songs like the single \\"hate to say i told you so\\", \\"main offender\\", outsmarted\\", \\"knock, knock\\", \\"die, alright\\", and \\"find another girl\\" this album is just unstoppable. you put it on and nothing is able to stop you from listening to it beginning to end.  it is so catchy, so fast, so fun, and so good. nothing else is like it. and thats why im scared for the american punk of today. if everything is going in the direction of new found glory, blink 182, and sum41, im moving to sweden.
0385484518|5.0|Inspiration for almost any reader.  This book provides sometimes subtle, sometimes powerful insight into what it means to be living, and what it is to be dying.  What many of us can take home from this book is the process by which the author learns from Morrie lessons on life.  This may prove a strong analogy for us--Mitch's Tuesdays are the moving lessons each of us reach in our life; Morrie is every teacher, parent, or event that has given us meaning.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Pop this cd into ur stereo, crack open a beer, and listen, because after only 15 seconds of \\"its time to party\\" you will want to get on the phone, call your friends, and plan the biggest, baddest party of your life.  the first 2 songs \\"its time to party\\", and \\"party hard\\" will get you going, #3 \\"girls own love\\" will make you see another great side of andrew, this man is pure genius from beginning to end, from \\"she is beautiful\\" a high strung love song, to \\"I LOVE NYC\\" an american anthem. with some killer riffs, fast beats, very loud screaming, and even a little techno influence, Andrew W.K. is where todays music is headed, and thank god to that.
B000063K2W|5.0|A veritable Who's Who of great 1930s actresses--and no men!--appear in this film version of Clare Booth Luce's play.  Norma Shearer plays a devoted wife whose husband is having an affair with the &quot;salesgirl&quot; at the perfume counter (Joan Crawford).  Her &quot;friends&quot; know.  She doesn't--at first.  &quot;The Women&quot; is set at beauty parlors, bridge parties, fashion shows, a Nevada divorce ranch and the ladies lounge of fine restaurants.  The catty dialogue and wry commentary about men and women is truly fun to experience.<br />For fans of vintage fashion, this film is wonderful eye candy.  Not only are the outfits that the main actresses wear quite fun to check out, it even features a fashion show.<br />Crawford is wonderful as the conniving other woman, and &quot;The Women&quot; made me an instant Shearer fan.  Shearer manages to come across as a strong, self-reliant woman throughout most of the movie, despite being the wronged wife still in love with her husband.<br />Keep in mind while watching that &quot;The Women&quot; is definitely a film of its times.  Enjoy it as such.
B000067CPX|4.0|This here, the follow-up to RHCP's 1999 album of the year &quot;californication&quot; isnt too bad, not too bad at all actually.  there are some very good songs here.  songs like the title track, &quot;cant stop&quot;, &quot;throw away your television&quot;, and &quot;ca bron&quot; will get you on your feet, while songs like &quot;midnight&quot;, &quot;tear&quot;, and &quot;this is the place&quot; will make you think.  Every song here is inspired and unique with some sort of meaning too it, just like all chili pepper songs.  this is sure to satisfy rhcp fans, old and new.  it sure satisfied me.
B00005KA9G|5.0|I brought \\"The Full Monty\\" home one evening when my boyfriend was not feeling well because I thought that a good laugh would cheer him up. His reaction to seeing the video box? \\"I'm already not feeling well. I don't want to watch a movie about a bunch of male strippers prancing around.\\" And then we put in the movie and couldn't stop laughing.<br />\\"The Full Monty\\" is about so much more than male strippers. The film centers around out-of-work steelworkers trying to cope with life now that their mill is shut down. The movie realistically explores male friendship, men's feelings about failing their wives' expectations, devotion to family, coping with loss,... but in ways that do not become depressing.<br />The stripper plan comes about because Gaz (Robert Carlyle) needs to come up with money to bring his child support current so that he can continue seeing his son. The father-son relationship is one of the most touching aspects of the movie.  Gaz's son, Nate, tags along with Gaz as he tries to put together a Chippendale-style show to catch up on his child support.  [As an aside, \\"The Full Monty\\" and \\"A Thousand Clowns\\" with Jason Robards would be an interesting pair of movies to see together as a starting point for examining what makes a good father.]<br />The relationships between the dancers that Mark Addy and Carlyle assemble is fun to watch. Tom Wilkison (also seen in \\"The Patriot\\", \\"In the Bedroom\\", and \\"Moulin Rouge\\") is excellent as their former supervisor who turns to dancing to cover his wife's extravagant spending. Addy is equally good as Gaz's chubby friend who is struggling with his marriage: His wife wants him to take a job in a local variety store. He thinks she's having an affair because he's too fat.<br />To top it off, the soundtrack is awesome!

B00005JL8C|5.0|...I considered Chapter 5 to be very important. This is the kind of movie that has to be viewed in its entirety, from beginning to end without interruption. I am not especially fund of dark stories, of sadomasochism. You may want to hold on to something that would make you feel secure and safe while viewing this movie. In a world of dysfunction, the main character, Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika Kohut is among the top. She is a forty year-old piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory (incidentally she thinks that none of her pupils are good enough). She lives with her mother who worries about her daughter but in actuality is unable to face the fact that her daughter is an adult. Their co-dependency would make you sad. They sleep on the same bed and they even have fistfights! This dysfunctional relationship makes Erika among other things a voyeur. Erika meets a young man, whom she uses to act on her secret desires. He is sympathetically played by Benoit Magimel. Somewhere along the movie you wish she would listen to this man, but this is not a love story although a lot of `I love you' statements are uttered. Even the boyfriend thinks she is sick. It was petrifying to watch a scene where Erika performs an act of self-mutilation. The film never shows the details but the effect is tremendous. This movie drives you on the edge of your seat. It was a relief  when it ended, although quite abruptly, so there goes another French movie that will make you think for a long time after the last frame. <br />If you are already a fan of Isabelle Huppert, you will find this extraordinary and remarkable performance indeed worthy of a Best Actress award (2001 Cannes Film Festival). But if you cringe at the thought of a man hitting a woman but would like to get to know Isabelle Huppert, do not make this be your first movie. Watch something like Entre Nous or wait for Huit Femmes (8 femmes, also a 2001 movie). The Piano teacher is not yet rated in the US but if `Elizabeth' gets an `R', this movie easily deserves it.
B000063UR2|5.0|Well, sometimes it has its advantages to live in Europe. For instance when movie makers are bold enough to show their movies with a more artistic and less commercial approach. This was the case with movies like Army of Darkness or Legend. Being European I highly recommend the original cut with Jerry Goldsmith's fabulous score. Then again I guess it's all a question of personal taste. I saw the original cut first and fell in love with it, others may feel the same way about the U.S. version. So here's the good thing about this DVD - now you can own both versions and watch the one you personally prefer. If you have never seen this film before try the director's cut first. Its longer and the characters are better set.<br />The feature commentary by Ridley Scott answers some but by far not all questions you may have about the movie. So I'm still not absolutely certain if the director's cut is exactly the film version I saw 17 years ago. On the other hand there is a nice documentary on the DVD that features some very interesting interviews with the cast and crew - including the Master Tim Curry. Also you learn a lot about how they achieved some of the stunnig art work and overall dazzling look of the picture. This alone would be worth the price for the Ultimate Edition.<br />Still. One wonders what another director like Terry Gilliam would have done with this material. Or what would have happened if they'd done the movie with todays technology. Or if they didn't have to cut down on the script for reasons of money and time.<br />Anyway, if you are looking for a visual jawdropper: buy this DVD.
6300215717|5.0|What can you say about a film that embodies Old Hollywood Charm, Elegance, and Style?  Simply that you will allow yourself to be carried away to a simpler more serene time of movie making magic.  I watched this film years ago, yet when I finally got to visit the eternal city of Rome myself, I sought out the Mouth of Truth shown in the movie, so that I could reenact with my wife the moment between Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck.  Call me a Sap, but I love these old Hollywood Gems that leave that happy, yet melancholy feeling deep within you.
0767821629|5.0|This is a one of the more underesteimated movies, as here in sweden it when to rent-movies directly... Its far more deeper then Matrix, and a much nicer movie then ExistenZ. Also the plot is more real than you might think, as Im a System Developer myself (programmer) and Ive worked on a Massive Online game (where there is a whole world is online and people login to the world) so even that we today don't have the technoligy to Upload a game directly to the brain. but as soon we can iteract with the brain (the first experiments has been successful, by operating a chip to the brain a disabled person has been able to interact on a monitor screen) then we could create simular worlds... Anyhow a great movie!
B000067CPX|5.0|I own all of the cds by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They have been my favorite band of all time since fourth grade. I am listening to the cd as I write this review. The new sound seems to be some kind of tribute towards Hillel Slovak, their original guitarist who died of herione overdose. The band has gone through many changes and different members ever since first concieved by Flea and Anthony Kiedis. Among them have been Jack, Hillel, John, Chad, and Dave. The band of change has finally matured and found a new sound. The songs that stand out, such as By The Way, Dosed, Can't Stop, and I Could Die For You really express how the band has changed from the early days of coyotes and anti beat box bands. If you are in any way a fan for the chili peppers, or enjoy alternetive rock in general, you must buy this cd.
B00003Q43A|1.0|This has to be the biggest money maker to have nothing to it.  It has no story, no plot, no acting, and no script.  The special effects are average at best, it looks really fake on TV.  The aliens use Macintosh software to run their spaceship no wonder they lost.  This movie released in 1996 made 306 million dollars and was the first in many to just base a movie on special effects. Please don't buy this because they will just keep making more movies like this.
B000068QY7|5.0|This CD marks the return of Oasis to what they do best which is to play exciting and energetic rock music with the occasional rock ballad tossed in. I confess that I love the band as they are one of the few truly pure rock bands out there. This CD is certainly influenced by the Beatles but so what? Aren't we all influenced by something or someone? The fact is that Noel and Liam Gallagher are taking the Beatles influence and making it their own. These songs are beautiful rock songs played well and recorded as well too.<br />I say that Oasis is a refreshingly brawling, unpretentious, straightforward and true to form rock band and it's so good to see them with another release and to have them around.
B00003CXDD|4.0|This movie is a good movie.  It has good sets and good special effects, although I think it needs a little help in the story department.  This movie stars Val Kilmer and done by George Lucas.  It was released in 1988 and made pretty good money and has become a cult classic.  These movies have become popular again because of the recent surge in fantasy movies.  If you like this movie try Legend(1985) or Labyrinth(1986) and the newer ones harry potter and Lord of The rings. my suggestion BUY IT!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Oh, Spider-Man was a perfectly spun movie. The characters were fabulous, the special effects were off the wall, and the story was action packed and thrilling! I never thought I would like a movie that came from a comic, but wow, was I surprised! The plot was awesome, and it left me wanting to see more! From start to finish, it was perfect. This movie had all the good stuff...love, wisdom, responsibility, revenge, and awesome action scenes. In case you dont know, Spider-Man is about a graduating senior that gets bitten by...you guessed it...a spider! (no way!) And instead of it becoming seriously infected, it gave him super powers, so he could save the world from all evil, and just be a hero. There is so much more to it! Anyone that likes action movies should go see it! I so have to give this movie 5 stars. spider-Man is a perfectly spun movie, for anyone to enjoy.
0792844890|4.0|This is a good movie and is very funny and it stars Mel brooks.  This movie spoofs Star Wars to a pretty good effect.  The only problem with this movie is it is to predictable and the story to it is thin.  Released in 1987 this movie didn't do well at the box office.  This DVD is good featuring trailers and extras and is worth the buy, but I can only watch it a couple of times or It will tire.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Cast Away was a fine ilm. The acting by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt was wonderful, and the plot was great. There were lots of messages in this film as well. Tom Hanks plays a character who works for Fed Ex. One night he has to go on an airplane to deliver packages...and it crashes. Luckily, Tom Hanks survives the crash and ends up on a deserted island, where he has to learn to fend for himself. Some of the Fed Ex packages arrive on the shore, and Tom uses what is inside to help him survive. With no one but himself, and Wilson, a volleyball with a hand imprint on it, Tom's character learns that in life you never take things for granted, and live each day with hope, because each new day brings new possibilities. The ending was a little sad, but it made sense and worked out. The film was a little long, but to fit all that into it, it had to be. Cast Away was certainly a fine film for everyone to enjoy.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This is a classic case where the movie looks better than it really is.  This movie released purposely on Memorial Day Weekend 2001 had a thin story line other than the Pearl Harbor Attack.  Kate Beckinsale is hardly a good actress and the movie just suffers from bad acting from everyone.  The other problem with this film is it is too long. They could have m ade this a 1 and a half hour movie instead of 3 long hours.  This movie shouldn't be on two discs because DVDs can hold 4 hours and the extras and the song to this movie are terrible.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters, Inc. demonstrates the type of comedy that we sometimes miss....Good old fashion fun. No sick jokes, just humorous ones to make you laugh and laugh for a long time. Whether you buy this movie on DVD or VHS, it is an instant family classic. A tale of friendship, monsters, and what we all have wondered when we were real little...what was in our closet at night? Smelly socks? Wrinkled shirts? Or monsters? This comedy has it all, including a little twist on the monsters themselves. The monsters are more afraid of us than we are of them. If you dont even rent this movie, you are missing out on a wonderfully put together one for the whole family.
6304698658|4.0|This movie is a classic I laugh at it every time I watch it.  This movie was released in 1989 and stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Juliette Lewis and many others.  My family and I watch this movie very Christmas Eve party and get a kick out of it.  The DVD should be much better and should re-release it on a Widescreen format and with deleted scenes and many other extras.  This DVD is worth it for the movie alone, it is hilarious but I still wish they would re-release the film on Widescreen.
B00005JKL8|5.0|Behind Enemy Lines was not another one of those war-type movies where some guy gets shot down in his airplane. It had much more to it than that. It wasnt predictable, it was an edge of your seat thriller. Behind Enemy Lines had a perfect plot, and a perfect ending. Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman did an excellent job, as did the other actors and actresses of this film. When two pilots decide to fly over an area that they aren't supposed to fly over, their plane camera takes pictures of missles and illegal doings. They are seen and are shot down, after an incredible fight, and his friend is shot. Now Owen Wilson is running for his life, and can only rely on his instincts, and those people who are instructing him from afar. It is a perfect hide and seek type movie...it is action packed and full of excitement. That is why I have given this movie such a high rating. Behind Enemy Lines was shocking, powerful, and an excellent film.
B00005QIPH|4.0|So there are a lot of people who are probably quite jealous of the five young members of the Strokes. Least importantly, they are stylish and good-looking. But more importantly, they are just really good at making records. A lot of critics have been crying about how the Strokes grew up privileged. And now they are \\"too snotty.\\" What does that have anything to do with the music they are creating? They were over-hyped and have rich parents and that makes the record bad and blah blah blah. So what? \\"It's too derivative\\" they say. But what isn't? Certainly it's better to be compared to the Velvet Underground or Iggy and the Stooges then to some crap-'90s grunge band. The Strokes are so much different than their peers and it's been 20 years since anything even resembling their album was released. So get over your jealousy or whatever it is and LISTEN. Don't criticize the Strokes simply because you don't get it. <br />The album: Yeah, it's good. It's short and compact. It's vibrant and aggressive and cool. And it's nothing like anything else. So if you like post-punk and aggressive new wave stuff...then buy it. But if you like Nickelback, don't buy it. It's pretty simple, really.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars I was the next Star Wars movie we have all been waiting for. It is the perfect beginning to a legend that we will never forget. We are introduced to Annakin Skywalker, the young Darth Vador, and Obi Wan Kenobie, as well as some new characters like Jar Jar Binks. It is an action packed thriller with cool fight scenes, cool characters, and great acting. This is a must see for anyone who vaguely likes the Star Wars films.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My husband and I took our granddaughter to see this movie and we all truly enjoyed it.  I absolutely loved Boo, she is so very cute.  I enjoyed the way all the monsters fell in love with her.  I hope this movie helps children not to be afraid of the \\"monsters under the bed or in the closet\\".
B000067CPX|5.0|After all of these years, the Red Hot Chili Peppers still find the time to facinate the world with their music.  \\"By the Way\\" is an absolute masterpiece.  I would like to see the Chili Peppers get album of the year again as they did in '99 for \\"Californication\\".  I am really getting tired of all of this pop music ... that infest the radio these days.  \\"By the Way\\" is a very mellow CD and I don't think I've ever heard Anthony's voice sound so good.  The vocals and guitars on this album are awesome.  I encourage anyone who reads this review to go out and buy the new Chili Peppers CD.
0971855110|5.0|Flylady was an answer to all my concerns. I tried to be a good housewife and mother. I WANTED a clean and clutter free house, just as much as every one else, but it just seemed to be too much for me. I would get overwelmed just THINKING about cleaning house. My work offers the option to go to work or stay home. And many times I stayed home to clean house only to find that one day wasnt enough. What was my problem? I wasnt organized, I didnt have any routines. I went in blind, and I worked until I crashed and burned. Flylady has taught me what I need to know to have the home without the stress or crash! The system is awsome! and it works. Many of the things she tells me to do, I was already doing before I found her, BUT there are many things that have been a wonderful help for me too!<br />The book was just an added blessing. The thought that now, those without the internet can have flyladies help!!! How awsome. I am encourageing my step mother to get the book. She has a wonderfully CLEAN house, but lots of clutter in every crack and crevise. <br />I disagree that this book is on for the really messy. My house was never really dirty, it was always cluttered and crowded. now its clean AND clutter free!
0316666343|2.0|The book started out with a promise to be an interesting book but about 1/3 of the way into the book I began to get bored.<BR>I stuck it out &amp; managed to finish the book but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or even to my enemies.  It had such promise &amp; then fizzled big time.
B00000JCOV|1.0|This band does not exempt true metal, and the fact that it's so popular, because everyone and their brother likes it. The essence of real metal is to have solos, which now is sadly, a lost art. Metal doesn't have any unneccesary people or instruments, turn tables, sampling, and percussion is not needed. Also, metal bands get to the point and have a cause of existance, other than to get angry teenagers on their side. The only new band that is close to metal is the great band Godsmack. The popularity of this band amazes me. Their fans never check out real metal for the fact is that they're old these days. <br />I think the reason for their masks, jumpsuites, and unique numbering is for success, as Kiss had done with they're costumes. They're in it to bring success to their hometown in Iowa, which is really a lost cause. It already is famous because Ozzy did the infamous &quot;beheading of the bat&quot;. <br />The music has no structure and gets boring really fast. Music these days has no structure, so I guess they're following that trend. The double bass drum going 24/7 gets annoying and only works with Slayer. Sure, these people might know how to play an instrument, and I give them credit for that, but it's just not good. What lacks in this band is the following of not being trendy. To be there just to create music. They're just another band to copy other bands in a different way, and soon someone will copy them. What we need is a new metal band wich follows the qualities of true metal.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This was a such a great CD! The songs were ALL so good, &amp; saving the best for the last, Darren Hayes voice was amazing! It just blends in with tone of the song. It's not often that we get an album in which all the songs are good. Ususally, there are one or two rotten tomatoes in the basket. But Affirmation was one album in which ALL the songs were superb! My favourites were 'Chained to you' and 'The Best thing'. I keep listening to ALL the time. These songs are a refreshing change from the ususal pop songs.
0060254920|5.0|My six year old grandson has a new copy of this to replace the one that his mother and uncles wore out. <BR>Somehow it appears to make him very thoughtful when we read it together, which must be a good thing.<BR>He can spend half an hour examining the imaginative Wild Things and their strange construction.
B000067G3C|3.0|This movie is justifiably famous for its nonstop action sequences, which are carefully filmed, directed and edited. I admit to being on the edge of my seat at many points. Dennis Hopper is, as usual, over the top in his role as a psycho former cop using terror as a way to get money he thinks is coming to him as compensation for injuries. We like to see Dennis in this type of role; we expect it, and thus are not disappointed. The supporting cast is good. Reeves and Bullock, around whom the subplot of a developing love relationship centers, probably do as well as they can with their lines. Bullock seems more at ease. Reeves seems a bit wooden. But the love subplot struck me as incredibly corny; it was extensive enough for me to dock the movie a couple of stars in the rating.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this film is the best film i've seen since i don't even know when.  i've never seen anything like it before. when the movie was over, i had to sit and absorb what i had just seen.  it's an amazing piece of film making!!
B00003CXA3|5.0|Like a fine wine this movie has aged masterfully.  If anything it is a classic example of how the 70's were a golden period of filmaking.  All the adjectives about The French Connection have been used...gritty, tough, violent etc. Watching it again I was impressed on so many levels, particularly the way Friedkin develops the characters and tells the tale.<br />What can you say about Gene Hackman's Popey Doyle?  Yes, he's a brutal racist without any redeeming qualities.  Yet why do we want him to catch the suave debonair Fernando Rey so badly?  It is a testament to both Hackman's brilliant,explosive performance and Friedkin's masterful direction that we are left rooting for someone we really shouldn't be.<br />The car-subway chase is still exhilirating, but for my money there are two scenes that truelly stand out.<br />First watching Hackman stakeout Rey outside the posh French Restaurant in the bitter cold New York winter.  No words are spoken but you can feel the bite of the cold air and the unforgiving chill that grips the city.<br />The second is the cat and mouse game that is played out between the two at Grand Central Station, culminating in the little wave goodbye that Rey gives.<br />Why don't we see this sort of filmaking anymore?<br />The bottom line...an ugly cop, doing an ugly job in an ugly city (no Disneyfied Times Square here!) makes for a great film.
B000002AGE|5.0|It seems that when I talk or read about this body of music, someone get defensive.  Well it is good but... I first heard this CD when I was buying some Infinity speakers.  The salesperson used this CD to demo the bass response of the speakers.  I bought the speakers and then bought the vinyl.  Years later I now have the CD and have even better Infinity speakers.  The two were meant for each other.
B000066AXC|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is an example of the rare great hollywood movie with a true and real story attached. Russell Crowe portrays John Nash, a Genius in the field of advanced math and theories of science as well as our economic status. He is plagued with terrible hallucinations throughout his life. Throughout the entire movie you do not know if he is hallucinationg or the things you see are really there. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer along with an award winning cast of writers were able to capture Schizophrenia like no other movie has ever truly been able to do. Ed Harris delivers a suberb performance portraying the object of Nash's hallucinations as a CIA Agent using Nash to decode Russian messages. Nash believes everything he says and even follows it to the letter. Jennifer Connelly also delivers an award winning performace as Nash's faithful wife. She is with Nash through all of his problems and ulitmately cites her as his greatest achievement for all the help and love she gave him. I won't give up the end for you in case you haven't seen it yet, but i will say that it is a fitting ending for an award filled movie.
B00005A46T|5.0|All you reviewers crying and moaning need to go back and keep on being loyal to all those no-name bands you mentioned and just leave Slipknot alone. Let me make something clear, all those bands nobody has ever heard of are in that league because they're nothing and they never will get recognition. Slipknot is mainstream and as big as they are because they're the absolute best! They were merely put here to do what they do. Anybody who is idiotic enough to rain negativity on this band should have their mouth sewn shut. This is the absolute heaviest record I have ever heard, and it is so finely crafted and well produced, words cannot even describe it. The power of Slipknot alone cannot even be reviewed in words! Where the debut album is not quite as heavy as this one, it's more melodic and may even be better. So, to anybody out there who is willing to give Slipknot a chance, they just might end up being your favorite band.
630521610X|5.0|Scream is undoubtedly horror's milestone. It did wonders for the horror of the late 90s. Much like Halloween in the 70s, it set up the formula for horror movies after it. Even though many horror movies overused that formula.<br />  Everyone knows the plot. And it's simply basic. Someone is killing a town's teenagers, and it's obvious the killer is obsessed with movies. But there's a whole different story behind that simple plot. And it's handled in a way that brings true horror to real life. Kevin Williamson wrote a great script, with the wittiest dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. I honestly think every little wink to movies and every snappy comeback said in Scream did not come off corny at all. Half of that success is due to the talented cast. Neve Campbell is our heroine, and becomes much like that of Jamie Lee's Laurie Strode. Courtney Cox-Arquette and David Arquette met on this set, and their chemistry is shown greatly. I love the couple. Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy supply most of the comedic relief during the darkest tones of the movie, and do it well. Skeet Ulrich plays the boyfriend to a tee, and his resemblance to Johnny Depp from Nightmare on Elm Street is crazy. And the awesome Rose McGowan. She was also great. And all thanks to Drew Barrymore for giving us one of the most intense scenes in a horror movie. And I don't believe Scream's horror movie tone could not have been done without Wes Craven. This is definitely his movie, and it shows.<br /> Scream's DVD presentation is certainly a good disc. An undoubtedly entertaining and insightful commentary is given by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson. Although an additional one from the cast would have been a nice addition, but I'm not going to complain. There are many behind-the-scenes vendettas to explore, and the usual theatrical trailers and tv spots are also available.<br /> Six years after its release, Scream has already gone down as a horror classic. Actually, the whole trilogy is classic. Although the two sequels are nothing in compare to Scream.gh the two sequels are nothing in compare to Scream.
6305922756|5.0|It is not hard to make the argument that This is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies ever. It is brilliant from start to finish and is so rich with hilaious dialogue and physical acting that it will stand the test of infinite viewings. Rob Reiner is at his best in this movie, and keeps up admirably with the constant improvisation of the films stars. The camera never misses a beat, and if it does we don't know because it always finds something funy to focus on. Consider the scene in which the band's manager Ian is having a conversation with studio rep Bobbi Fleckman on the obscene nature of the album's cover (a woman is being forced to smell an outstretched male hand wearing a black glove). He more or less threatens to put out the album despite store boycotts. Fleckman dismisses the idea by saying \\"money talks and [b.s.] walks.\\" The camera is not on her as she says this, it is instead on Ian's face as he displays a hilarious look of bewilderment at the uttering of such a statement which he seems to have taken a little too literally. It is moments like these that will continue to pop up and amuse viewers forever, should they tire of the bigger jokes in the movie. Indeed that is the mark of a great comedy.<br />The advantage that This is Spinal Tap has over other comedies is that it's subject of rock and roll and in particular rock stars, has perpetually been the provider of unintentional comedy. The behavior of the band in this movie, as hilarious and over the top as it may be, can never be too far from the truth. For an example of this, think of how an all black cover is a comedy piece in this movie, and yet a few years later Metallica released one of the most successful albums of the past 20 years with an almost identical cover. Thats not to say that Metallica is on Spinal Tap's level of absurdity, but it is just proof that no matter what lengths the movie goes to in order to poke fun at rock stars, it can never stray too far from the truth. That provides evenmore depth and humor to a movie and helps to further cement its reputation as a true classic.
B00005AFVR|3.0|I have been a big fan of Bruce Springsteen for years and having had a chance to see him live, was looking forward to this CD. Springsteen's live performances are legend ... he is one of the few contemporary artists whose live performances defined his work - the energy and way in which songs were interpreted in live performances is something all fans remember. <br />Although this live album captures some of this - somehow it falls short of the live performances of Springsteen and E-Street band in their prime. Hopefully, the record company and Springsteen will be able to issue some live recordings in compilation from past bootlegs in the future.
B000066NW0|5.0|this is a great CD... it is not like all that other [non inspirational] pop where the singers dont write there music. the lyrics are wonderful and powerful. go buy the CD!
0553260111|5.0|I recently saw the movie- I liked it a lot so I decided to read the book, and man they're quite different. The movie skipped over many important things and added things that weren't part of the book...Bourn never had a ton of passports in his safety box in Zurich like he did in the movie- he had to steal them in the book...and there are many other differences also...If you enjoyed the movie you should read the book- (it's not like books that were written AFTER the movie was made so it isn't repeating what you saw..) Or if you want a good spy thriller this is the book for you! I'm on my way to reading the Bourne Supremacy!
B000067CPX|4.0|but not great. An average sounding CD that you will toss aside after a few listens. By The Way is definitely the best song, and I can't really find another song that is really worth mentioning, so I won't. Buy it if you have the 15 bucks to waste.
1558908498|5.0|Although Scream 2 doesn't surpass its predecessor, it's definitely an original suspense ride with a new bit of freshness added to it. Sidney Prescott is now in college as a theatre major, with a new group of friends and great new boyfriend. Her life, although still scarred by what happened back in Woodsboro, is seemingly becoming peaceful. But all that ends when Stab, the movie based on her Woodsboro horror, is released. The murders begin again, and Sidney's friends become targets.<br /> Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox-Arquette, David Arquette, and Jamie Kennedy return with a fresh new cast to run from the face they all fear. Scream 2 is undoubtedly -- and like I stated before -- not as good as the original, but the scares and laughs are just as high. The opening scene is one to make anybody uncomfortable in a movie theatre. Kudos to Wes Craven for many brilliantly crafted scenes in Scream 2. I especially love the &quot;Cassandra&quot; theatre scene. It was definitely a heart racer. Another nail biter was the cop car scene. Timothy Olyphant, Elise O'Neil, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schrieber, Laurie Metcalf, and many more make up the supporting cast, and all are great. Especially Laurie Metcalf. That lady took her role and upped the notch with it. Great performance!<br /> The Scream 2 DVD release is a bit lacking in the supplements department. I suggest purchasing the Scream Trilogy Box Set to get the true special edition of the disc. It's complete with an interesting commentary, hilarious outtakes (Listening to Elise O'Neil {Hallie} screaming different ways was hilarious), interesting deleted scenes (Although the scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar out in the courtyard is still nowhere to be found), behind-the-scenes featurettes, music videos, trailers, and more. It's extras galore on that disc!<br /> Scream 2 is a great follow up to Scream. If only Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) could have fought about their own movie within the movie, Scream 2 will be one of the best movie sequels.be one of the best movie sequels.
B000056K04|5.0|I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the Everyday release from the Dave Matthews Band. I have been a long time listener to the band and this CD along with Busted Stuff and the unreleased &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; are among my favorites. The new way that Dave uses the electric guitar, I thought, gave new dimension and depth to their sound. And yes, they had several hits off this album (Space Between, Everyday, I did it, If I had it all) and the reason they had so many hits was because the ALBUM WAS GOOD. Don't listen to the other reviewers if you are considering this purchase. I would reccomend it to any DMB Fan or anyone who just wants a good listen. 5 stars Dave Matthews Band, and keep the good stuff coming!
B000067CPX|1.0|I understand that bands evolve, and that they often emerge with different styles on different albums. I agree it is always good to keep things fresh. As far as the direction the chili peppers are going, on paper it sounds great. The softer, more introspective songs on Blood Sugar Sex Magik and other albums were brilliant. For them to drop the funk and expand on those kinds of songs would be cool with me as long as they maintained the same standards of quality and musicianship. <br />     Unfortunately By the Way does not utilize the awesome musicianship of Flea, John Frusciante or the rest of the chili peppers. The drumming is especially lackluster considering we know how good Chad can be. Why waste all of this talent? There are some decent songs here and there, but overall this album is quite bland. Anthony Keides' lyrics have lost their bite and often come off as cliche. <BR>   <BR>    I consider Blood Sugar Sex Magik to be one of the top three albums of the nineties. At the time it was released it was different from anything they had done before. The musical genius of every member was used to its fullest and they tore through funk, hard rock, more mellow tracks, etc. While I am not one to constantly compare albums, it is hard to overlook the ridiculously simple drum beats, lifeless bass hooks, and trite lyrics of By the Way when you know how fresh and inspiring this band can be in all genres- including mellow songs.<br />      It was not my favorite, but I enjoyed most of Californication because the songs were well structured and their musicianship was at least somewhat utilized. Like I said, if they want to mellow out thats cool but \\"mellowing out\\" doesn't equate to writing poor songs and forgetting to play their instruments to their fullest ability. There are very few moments on this CD when they really \\"get down\\" and play like they're putting their soul into it. Even One Hot Minute, despite being somewhat misguided, had some great moments. <br />   I haven't given up on the chili peppers- I know they can write some damn good \\"mellow\\" songs. Still, I never thought the day would come when I would listen to a chili peppers album this poor.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A pretty good movie.  Outstanding performances by everyone, but a kind of &quot;so what?&quot; articulation of Nash's story.  I think it would have had more impact if we had seen more of both his genius (not the BS with him doing nonsensical stuff, but actually doing math relating to his theory that won the Prize) and his illness.  The movie at a minimum should have given more information about Nash's unique contribution to Mathematics.  All told, it got about 2 minutes, as compared to the amount of time given his hallucinations.
B000067G3C|5.0|It was unbelieveably great!  I love this movie so much, I want to get it naked, heh.
6305903182|4.0|The Scream trilogy rightfully deserves to be called the \\"Star Wars of horror movies.\\" All three entries played off of one another, and in the end, all light was revealed on the whole series in a twisted ending. And I must say, an entertaining thrill ride.<br /> The third and final Scream finds Sidney Prescott living in isolation and in fear of once again being stalked. Dewey Riley and Gail Weathers are coincidentally teamed up when Cotton Weary is killed in true Scream - or in  their world, Stab - fashion. Again, they are united with a cast full of stereotypical yet fun characters (Especially Parker Posey) who run, die, and try to outwit whoever is under the mask.<br /> I, for one, am glad they ended this series with a third installment. Even though this movie is entertaining and deals a deserving ending, I could see the series getting old with another installment. Just how many people would have a reason to kill Sidney? But like I said, Ehren Kruger came up with a final resolution that tied all three movies together in good fashion.<br /> The DVD is a complete fan's choice with features such as hilarious outtakes, a behind-the-scenes montage, a couple of deleted scenes (An interesting alternate opening), an alternate ending, Creed video (I love it), trailers, a LOT of tv spots, audio commentary, and I do believe there may be one or two things I'm missing.<br /> As I've said before, the Scream Trilogy got a well-deserved and respective ending. The trilogy is truly a classic.

0316666343|1.0|I have never read a more depressing book!  Her &quot;heaven&quot; is not a heaven at all---there is no &quot;longing&quot; in heaven!  I am just dumbfounded by all the praise for this book.

B00000JZC4|5.0|Comparing this to &quot;the Amalgamut&quot;, it's much more sincere, melodic, deep and moving.  This album saved my life.  Hate to think that Patrick is approaching sellout proportions, but the new album has begun to portray exactly that.
B00003CXI1|2.0|If you want thrills, read the Harry Potter series.  The movie did not capture my attention the way the books did.  J.K. Rowling did an excellent job when she wrote the books.  The movie was too dark.  There was no brightness, and it seemed dull.  Half of the adventure in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was lost in the creation of the movie.
0375707972|5.0|This is an interesting parable, as appropriate for today's financial scandals as for the aftermath of the Nazi era which it depicts, with its focus on the consequences of tacitly \\"going along to get along\\" instead of making moral choices.<br /> It begins with a 15-year-old boy who has a tempestuous affair with a 36-year-old woman  -- two people at the height of their sexuality who are mutually exploitative.  But, they also have a sense of responsibility for each other;  Hanna Schmitz insists that Michael Berg apply himself to his schoolwork, in return, he reads a variety of books to her (her shortcoming is illiteracy).<br /> Now, think of this in terms of some recently failed businesses;  where the chief executive is obsessed with showing profits or making his company the dominant one in its field.  So, the books are cooked to show desirable results  --  and, the employees who must \\"go along to get along.\\"<br /> Hanna's story is of an illiterate peasant girl swept into the Nazi SS during the war, ending the war guarding some concentration camp inmates who die brutally.  She had many opportunities to spare them, but refused on the grounds of loyalty to what she saw as duty rather than an ethical issue of humanity by doing what was right.  Think of her in terms of employees of companies who remain silent in the face of wrong doing rather than \\"betray\\" a greater loyalty to the business.<br /> In brief, it's a parable about the price of doing right in contrast to the expediency of \\"going along to get along.\\"  Hanna is eventually brought to trial for her wartime actions and sent to prison;  Michael becomes a lawyer, with a career that is haunted by Hanna and their relationship.  Both used each other, and as a result both hurt each other.<br /> Sound familiar ?  Of course, it's the age-old story of the consequences of taking ethical shortcuts for personal profit or pleasure.  How many Europeans made similar choices in World War II ?  How many business executives made similar choices in recent years to enhance their reputations or profit ?<br /> \\"Ah, you want to understand why people can do such terrible things,\\" a motorist asks Michael when he at last decides to visit a concentration camp to try to understand what Hanna did during the war.  Hanna's whole life was a lie, her complicity with evil had a devastating impact on others  --  not because she was inherently bad  --  but because of her tendency of \\"going along to get along\\" rather than facing any risk or hardship.<br /> Even after her conviction, Hanna had \\"A proud, wounded, lost, and infinitely tired look.  A look that wished to see nothing and no one.\\"  Think of contemporary executives who destroy their companies by endorsing expediency rather than ethics, and proudly refuse to say as much as \\"I'm sorry\\" for the harm they cause.<br /> Schlink used a horrific example to make his point;  he is a law professor, skilled in dealing with the aftermath of cases where expediency overrules ethics and morals.  But, to a much lesser degree, it is a choice we all face  --  using an expedient \\"white lie\\" rather than upset a friend or colleague with some honest advice.<br /> Do we ever escape the consequences of such actions ?<br /> A few sentences from the end of his parable, Schlink writes: \\"The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on the top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as a matter that has been fully formed an pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive.\\"<br /> Think of it the next time you tell a white lie, or decide \\"going along to get along\\" is better than being honest to yourself and others.lar choices in recent years to enhance their reputations or profit ?<br /> \\"Ah, you want to understand why people can do such terrible things,\\" a motorist asks Michael when he at last decides to visit a concentration camp to try to understand what Hanna did during the war.

0385503954|5.0|Not much has appealed to me this year, but this is one book that I give five stars---excellent read!
0380789035|5.0|I first heard of Neil Gaiman from his excellent comic book series, Sandman. The tale of the being that represents dreams, Morpheus, a &quot;god&quot; of sorts.<br />In his novel, American Gods, he's taken the old gods of legend and transported them to America where they have faded away and now simply exist. When our main character Shadow gets out of prison, he learnes his wife and best friend are dead and that his old life is completely gone. So he takes a job for the mysterious Wednesday who takes him on a trip across America rounding up his allies, the fellow old gods, and Shadow learns he is much more of a key player in this saga than he ever thought.<br />This novel is outstanding and I reccomend it especially to anyone who likes Stepehn King or Dean Koontz. Fans of King's The Stand or the Talisman will love this one.
B000067CPX|5.0|As a  massive chili peppers fan of ten years, i was so eagerly waiting for this album to come out. It was such an occasion when californication was released, and this latest release was much the same. It is virtually nothing like my personal favourite chili's album (and favourite album by anyone really,) which is blood sugar sex magik, but this in no way means it is not a fantastic album. This is in effect \\"californication II\\". Opener 'by the way' is a brilliant single, and has got everything u would expect. 'Universally speaking' is a chilled out acoustic number, while 'this is the place' is a powerful yet peaceful song. 'Dosed' follows as a beautiful love song, before 'dont forget me' just explodes into a massive wall of sound when it gets to the chorus. 'The zephyr song' is another happy sing along song, a possible candidate for the second single. 'Cant stop' comes next, and is as close to blood sugar sex magik as you get on this album. A brilliant funk driven song, with Kiedis shout-rapping meaningful nonsense at his best. The next 2, 'i could die for you' and 'midnight' are probably the weakest on the album, but in no way bad songs. 'Throw away your television' is an upbeat number, with flea's fingers working overtime. 'Cabron' follows, with fast acoustic folky guitars, a complete shift from their usual sound. 'Tear' is another nice sounding chill song, before 'on mercury' comes on, sounding like chili peppers at a ska festival, but a damn fine song, very upbeat. 'Minor thing' is an excellent uptempo song, with a nice funk feel to it in places. 'Worm tape' is the penultimate song, and has very strange sounds in the chorus, while the guitar in the chorus sounds not too dissimilar to the shadows! 'Venice Queen' wraps up the album, and is in effect 2 songs, both being excellent. A great end to a great album. Throughout the album, it is evident that they have put a lot of emotion in to both the music and the lyrics, while not losing their playful side. Also, the vocal harmonies, which are in every single song, are beautiful, with Kiedis using John Frusciante's voice perfectly to compliment his own, which he has now developed into a great singing voice, not just a rapper anymore. On the whole, a heartily recommended album, whether you are new to the chili's or are familiar with their old stuff, and are unsure about their new sound. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.
B000063UR2|5.0|Like many others, I was looking forward to seeing the director's cut of what has long been one of my favorite fantasy films. Now that I've seen it, though, I find myself wishing I'd skipped the director's cut and just watched the U.S. theatrical version again instead.  Fortunately, though, you get both versions with this edition.<br />The director's cut contains a lot more background information and character development, resulting in a notably more coherent, more fairy tale-like story. The problem is, it goes too far in that direction. The result is that while the movie makes more sense, it loses much of its magic. Some details are better left to the imagination, or even left out entirely.<br />The scenes that were added back in all serve to make Legend a more conventional movie, while not fully converting it into a standard fantasy/action film. As a result, this cut doesn't really work as either type of film.<br />Also, the orchestral score was really jarring for me at many points. It was far too conventional, and had almost none of the ethereal quality of the Tangerine Dream soundtrack that was so much a part of the theatrical release.<br />If you want to find out more detail about what was supposed to be happening in this film, by all means watch the director's cut.<br />The supplemental features alone will do an excellent job of giving you more background, though, and if you're looking to keep the magic alive, give that version a miss, and watch the U.S. theatrical cut on the second disk, instead.<br />The U.S. theatrical version is a clear five stars as far as I'm concerned, so I'll resist the temptation to rate the whole thing lower just because the director's cut is inferior.
B00004XONN|4.0|If your pre-conception of Radiohead is their 1993 hit &quot;Creep&quot;, bringing up the days of grunge and alterna-rock, don't bother buying Kid A until you're ready to accept that Radiohead has travelled down numerous different paths since then. &quot;Kid A&quot; has almost completely abandoned their alternative rock sound in favor of something completely undescribable in words. The genre of music this album fits into is exactly that, it's own genre of music. The music brings up deep memories from inside your mind, triggering various emotions across the record without you really realizing it and ultimately bringing you to a state of melancholy and sentimentality. Had you never heard their &quot;rock&quot; material, you would never be able to label this band under any musical style or conception.<br />Yorke's lyrics on this album have drastically changed since their older records, burying his vocal lines into the mix and sometimes mixing them and layering them in reverse with various other effects, making it an exercise to decipher his exact message. The instrumentation itself has also taken a different path, especially on behalf of the guitars. No longer being used in the forefront, the guitars are buried back behind everything else, assuming they are even used at all, serving as a piece which you will not directly notice in the songs, but you WOULD notice if it was missing. The bass is inactive as well in comparison to previous albums, but still used more than the guitars, doing a fantastic job on &quot;The National Anthem&quot;. The drumming has taken a turn rather than overstayed its visit, sometimes being replaced with electronic processed beats rather than a live set, but are definitely used more than any other live instrument. What seems to really dominate here are the numerous production chops, studio effects, keyboards, and synthesizers that actually make this a decidedly un-live record, requiring the band to change many aspects around when performing tracks in concert.<br />To some listeners the changes in music will make this album uninteresting and drawn out while to others it will take Radiohead onto a new level for them. What is really important is to draw your own conclusions about the meaning of the album (the common belief is that it tells the story of a human life) as a whole. Listen to it with an open mind. If it doesn't grow on you, there's always &quot;OK Computer&quot;, &quot;The Bends&quot;, and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; to fall back on. If it does, then you've reached Radiohead in another step in their growth process.

B000006O7C|3.0|This two-CD set represents, with the exception of one song, the work that would've become Jeff Buckley's follow-up to his magnificent debut album \\"Grace\\". It never quite reaches the dizzying romantic riff-filled goth/folk/R&B-inflected highs of that album, but it has its own beauty that cannot be overlooked.<br />The first disc comprises Jeff and his band's sessions with legendary Television guitarist Tom Verlaine. As detailed in David Browne's fine memoir \\"Dream Brother\\", Jeff had come to identify with Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's balancing act between artistic integrity and commercial success. Like Cobain, Jeff had come to resent the gloss liberally applied to his last album courtesy one Mr. Andy Wallace (although it suited Buckley's style far better than Cobain's), and decided he wanted a more \\"indie\\" feel to his follow-up. The Verlaine sessions did not culminate in a finished product, but rather finds Jeff feeling out his creative potential and directions. <br />\\"The Sky is a Landfill\\" is an explosive anti-media anthem, and \\"Witches' Rave\\" is a sweet piece of Smiths-inspired goth pop. \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" is an outgrowth of the blues leanings present on 'Grace', complete with a fine, sensual lyric (\\"Coffee smell and lilac skin/You're a flame in me\\"). The cover of \\"Very Sexy\\" entitled \\"Yard of Blonde Girls\\" finds Buckley exploring grunge, and the off-kilter \\"Vancouver\\", a tale of infidelity set in London (leaving the title fairly inexplicable), is a likewise ennervating piece of rawk. The sparse ballads \\"Opened Once\\", \\"New Year's Prayer\\" and \\"Morning Theft\\" are the closest in spirit to 'Grace', but only hint at the greatness acheived there. <br />The real revelation from these sessions is the Nirvana-esque ballad/rocker crossbreed of \\"Nightmares by the Sea\\". Unfortunately, Andy Wallace's remix of the first disc effectively neuters this track, but the original Verlaine mix is presented on disc two and is a messy, epic song filled with powerful, unforgettable imagery and undeniable heartbreak --- in short, precisely the kind of song that drew critical attention to Buckley in the first place. With powerful cymbal-thrashing like waves hurtling themselves against rocks, the song draws to a close. <br />\\"Haven't You Heard\\", neither a demo or a Verlaine session castaway, is another stab at a political song, and while it feels like confused vitriol and Buckley's falsetto actually becomes quite grating halfway through it, the song is powerful and well-executed enough not to dismiss. <br />Buckley's work was never user-friendly by any means, and always required multiple listens to grasp its nuances. The lo-fi demos on the second disc don't make his work any more accessible, but they are ultimately at least as rewarding a look into his mind as the first disc, as it showed him finally closing in on his vision. 'I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby (If We Wanted to Be)\\" may be awkwardly titled, but is a fantastic song, and stands with the best in Buckley's career. The Genesis cover, \\"Back in NYC\\" is surprisingly very good, a stripped-down take on a track from the prog-rock group's Gotham concept album 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'. The lovely \\"Jewel Box\\" stands on its own as well, but the rest of the demos simply don't offer enough of the finished product to merit repeated listens. <br />Finally, \\"Satisfied Mind\\", the song played at Jeff's funeral, isn't as transcendent as many of the covers the man recorded, so it simply has to settle for being very good instead of excellent. Not bad. <br />It's hard to criticize \\"Sketches\\", being that it was never intended as a final artistic statement, bur rather a musician's struggle to discover a new voice for himself. While he never was able to commit that voice to tape with a band present, he did leave some wonderful scraps for us Buckley fans to obsess over. And we should be grateful for it. And him.
B00005JL3A|4.0|When you hear that Hollywood is turning your favorite video game into a big-budget movie, normally you'd get pretty nervous. Just look at what happened to Mortal Kombat (Mortal-what?). Times change, however, and Resident Evil is by far one of the best video game to film transfers to date.<br />The story follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) as she wakes up in a shower. . . <br />Paul Anderson does a great job of making zombies scary again and uses any CGI to enhance the film instead of degrate it. The action scenes are well done and the story telling is quick paced with a sense of dread through out. The acting is top notch-even though some characters are about as cliched as you get. It's a fun movie for fans of the game or just horror fans in general. Definately worth checking out.
B00004YM0D|5.0|You can hear all of these songs when you turn on the Oldies station on the radio!<BR>Buy this for the score track-it is one of Trevor's best compositions, I am angry there is no score. Fortunatley for me, I was lucky enough to get my hands on an Academy Promo, so I can't complain. For those who aren't so lucky, this 7-minute masterpiece will have to do.<BR>Its beautiful, and sad and exciting all in one-what more could you ask for?<BR>Listen to the last song only people!! You won't regret it!!<BR>If you like Rabin's work, also check out American Outlaws, Deep Blue Sea, The 6th Day and Enemy of the State,  a few of his best scores to date, not counting Remember the Titans.
B000067CPX|2.0|I'm not a \\"purist,\\" nor do I expect rock bands to remain stagnant in their sound. That said, \\"By the Way\\" is just too watered-down for me to handle. The Chili Peppers have found their niche in the \\"we're weathered, but still rocking\\" vein of pop. It's upsetting that a band once so strengthened by their edginess and insane concoction of different styles of music is now so benign and ineffective. John Frusciante's adeptness for writing a pop riff is heavily on display here and and the musical ability of the rest of the band is sharpened and more realized, but the delivery is ho-hum and the album is a big yawn. The coolest thing about the album is Julian Schnabel's cover art. Now that's exciting!
B00005JKQZ|2.0|I really wanted to like this film,,,and i tried very hard. The story is excellent and the disease is protrayed in an excellent way. But i just couldn't get past Russell Crowe. I guess it's because i just don't like him as a person and that kept getting in my way. A good actor to me has a responsibility to the public just like sports figures do. But once your title gets to big for words i'll drop that person from existance.So my review is mixed. The real story is actually better.  Hollywood does what they think happened. If you really want to know about this story, read the book. The movie however is pretty good and i have always admired Ron Howard but his choice for lead was a mistake.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I didn't know what to expect, but I didn't like what I found.<br />This movie is spastic. There are dozens of edits every minute, each unjustified and collectively incoherent. The plot hangs together by a thread, weakly starched by lyrics borrowed from several familiar songs.<br />The speedy stop-motion video and overdubbed cartoon sound effects are insulting.<br />The movie views like a bad acid trip.<br />That this movie received such interest and critical acclaim speaks to the unsatisfied demand for creativity from Hollywood, and the void of taste swirling in the wake of the American populus.
B00005K3LW|5.0|This movie is one of my personal favorites. I think it is definitley the best one of the series. There is nonstop action, a brush of comedy, and all the explosions you can handle! Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are great together onscreen. This is a must-see.<br />DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE<br />RATED \\"R\\" FOR STRONG LANGUAGE AND GRAPHIC VIOLENCE<br />5 OUT OF 5 STARS
B00004YA0T|5.0|I own full or part Bruckner cycles by Karajan, Furtwangler, Celbidache, Giulini, Tintner, Skrowaczewski, Haitink, Wand, and Chailly... and this Jochum EMI set trumps them all.<br />Enough words have been spoken by others here of Jochum's imaginitive expertise with Bruckner. I can only add that, if the 5th Symphony's 2nd movement 6/8 climax before the coda doesn't make you feel touched by an angel, then you are ready to join Ted Williams in freeze-dried Heaven.  No one else catches Bruckner's penduluum swing of summer breeze beneath a shimmering sun here like Jochum (though Karajan and Celibidache come the closest, they are still miles away from Jochum's aural rapture).
0788816454|1.0|Some people will do anything to make an [fool] of themselves on the screen.Save your money, waste of time and effort. It's just plain stupid and makes america look even more stupid for letting something like this be made.I love Kathy Bates,,,,she's a great actress but i just don't understand how she could lower herself to making this film. If she needed a few bucks to get her by, she should have called me. This film is an utter disgrace.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Levigne's debut CD is an awesome mix of Alanis-sounding rock and pop-punk songs.  She's amazingly talented, both at writing and singing.  My favorite song on the album is \\"Sk8ter boi,\\" but all of the songs are great! Please ignore the other reviews people wrote about this, they're just jealous of such a wonderful artist.  I highly reccomend this CD!
6305171769|5.0|i did not get scared. rather i laughed through the whole movie. i loved it and it is not scary. maybe i am a little dark but i consider this  a comedy. i cant wait to see ressurection on dvd. my mom makes me wait for this kind of movie. it survived the jeepers creepers syndrome.
B00005B1W5|4.0|Good stuff! Clear picture, good sound definition. Actually deserved 5 stars but no booklet found inside the DVD casing - why miss out the booklet?
B000066NW0|5.0|Nowadays, a CD where each track is as good as or better than the previous track is very, VERY, rare.  \\"Let Go\\" has to be one of these albums. The Matrix did a great job producing \\"Let Go.\\"   \\"Let Go\\" is also one of those enhanced cd's, too, so I don't have to waste time downloading the \\"Complicated\\" music video off of Kazaa.  I can just watch it on my computer whenever I want!  The bonus track is pretty good, too...
0790729369|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  However, it will probably appeal more to women, but that does not diminish its effect or its quality.  You should add this movie to your home movie library.
B00003CXAT|5.0|One of the greatest directors of all time has created a world of beauty amazement and horror adventure. This movie was one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. Spielburg makes a dino film for all ages I mean all ages!This movie presents good thrills, an excellent plot brought by the author Michael Chricton, great acting, and of course the dino violence this is a fun thrilled ride for the whole family.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|This is an excellent movie and it should appeal to almost all audiences.  I recommend adding it to your home movie library.
0140386335|4.0|This book is absolutely amazing from the beginning to the end.  I can't describe how much I love and cherish this book.  There were times where I cried while reading this book.  However, towards the end of the book it does get kind of long-winded.  But the end of the book made up for that.  If you love adventure, you will love this book
0316666343|5.0|The booklap promises a novel that is \\"luminous and astonishing.\\"  Guess what?  That's not hyperbole.  It IS.<BR> <BR>By now, you must know that, at the outset, we meet Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who -- on a cold, snowy December late afternoon -- is raped and murdered by a neighbor in a corn field on her way home from eighth grade.  She goes to heaven.  And from heaven -- which is Susie's own personal heaven -- she watches life on Earth unfold for her family and friends -- and murderer.<br />Initally, that did not sound like a story I wanted to read.  Too dark, possibly too sentimental for this middle-aged, male reader.  Plus, I thought, we know who did it right at the top, so how interesting could this story be?  Regardless, I bought the book because (1) of the unanimously strong reviews I had read, and (2) I was delayed at an airport and was desperate for a book to read. <br />Well, surprise.  From the first page, I couldn't put the book down.  An absolute page-turner.  It's a winning mixture of true crime, coming-of-age story, fantasy, family drama and ghost story. And, for me, it was spiritually provocative, giving me pause regarding my notions of life, death and afterlife.<BR> <BR>And all exquisitely told by Sebold.  One reviewer called this a \\"miraculous\\" book.  I agree.  Another reviewer advised that, \\"if you read only one book this summer, this is the one to read.\\"  I agree heartily with that, too.  Buy it, read it, savor every word.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|I rented this movie because it said on the cover that is was similar to \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" which I really enjoyed.  This movie was as good and in some cases better than Blair Witch.  The acting is superb, for starters.  The idea of a dark spirit force existing in a VERY scary abandoned insane asylum was brillant.  This asylum was definately a character in the movie.  You could not pay me [enough money] to spend 5 minutes in this place!  The film is quiet successful in creating a real sense of dread and fear.  This is a very unsettling movie.  There are parts that tend to drag and there is a lot of talking, but these parts help to define the characters and later to display a kind of descent into madness for each of the work crew.  The segments of the movie with the tape recorded sessions with the institutionalized patient are intense and terrifying (I hope this was not a real tape of a real session, because that would be TOO scary!)  Overall, if you like to be unsettled and scared, this is a good flick to watch with the lights out...
0316666343|5.0|It would be hard to imagine a better book than this little jewel. It will be around for a very long time and I thank the author for a dazzling trip.
0452282152|5.0|Just finished &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; and I loved it. I could barely put the book down. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the book being it is a fictional account of a real painting and a real artist, but Tracy Chevalier did a wonderful job with the story.
B000066NW0|4.0|In the times where Britney rules the charts with her pre-fabricated and repititious music, we do have the artists that actually write their own lyrics and play their own instruments.  Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton -- and Avril Lavigne can be added to that list.  This punk, rock-out girl has proven that age is no barrier for great music and great writing in her debut album, \\"Let Go.\\"<br />\\"Losing Grip\\", the album's opening cut, is as vicious as it is addicting.  Showing the world that a teenage girl can be pissed off too, Avril proves in this opening track that she isn't looking for the cover of \\"Seventeen\\" -- and she sure as hell isn't Britney.<br />\\"Complicated\\", the album's first single, is purely addicting as it is heart-warming.  Though some of the lyric itself shows the adolescence of Avril (\\"I like you the way you are / When we're drivin' in your car\\"), it stills holds a powerful punch.  Other strong, poignant cuts include \\"Unwanted\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\".<br />For those looking for the more light-hearted cuts, \\"S8ter Boi\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" are infectious and fun songs that are likely to be stuck in your head all day long.  These are the ones you kinda kick back in the car with your stereo blasting and your friends blaring their awful vocal talents.  \\"Mobile\\" also belongs in this category of fun, despite its quite serious meaning of consistently moving around.<br />\\"With You\\" does remain the album's lyrical strongpoint; it is dark, light, sad and happy all at the same time.  Lavigne's voice powerfully echoes through the song with grace and talent.  \\"Naked\\" also should be given credit for its lyric, which remains a true testament to the overlooked talent of young stars.<br />All in all, \\"Let Go\\" is a great album with great music.  It has depression and frustration, happiness and understanding -- all coming from a girl who seems like she's your next door neighbor.  And when I say next door neighbor, I'm not referring to the one who wants you to hit her, baby, one more time.
B000067CPX|5.0|Am I the only person who likes diversity? This album is not like BSSM, but who wants a forty year old to write \\"sir psycho sexy\\" ? NOT ME. I enjoy old chili pepper stuff, I enjoy it alot. In fact, up until this album I cited BSSM as my favorite chili pepper album, but everyone needs variety in their lives. The peppers are no exception. They enjoy different styles of music. they are influenced by many different styles of music. They are growing as muscians and writers. That gives me hope. As a 17 year old girl I have to deal with immature boys all the time. It's good to know that some guys do grow out of that stage. that is not to say that they become boring. the peppers still have drive and energy, now they have added some focus to that. By the way is not a dull album by any means. The variety of styles and arrangements are enough to grab the attention of listeners. John Frusciante is really at the top of his game on this album. Flea and Chad play off of each other so well, they are one of the best rhythm sections in music today and as for Anthony, he has really come into his own as a lyricist. They aren't rocking out with their socks on anymore but they are still doing their own thing and taking chances. Maybe some fans will be able to take the chance too. Some highlights are \\"universally speaking\\", \\"don't forget me\\", \\"the zephyr song\\" \\"tear\\", \\"cabron\\", \\"minor thing\\" and \\"on mercury\\" . Go on. Take a chance. Just cause you grow up doesnt' mean you can't pull out Mother's Milk sometimes.
B000000Y1H|3.0|I own virtually all CD's of Thelonious Monk ever issued (from Blue Note, Savoy, Atlantic, Riverside, Columbia) and I have to tell you this: I've never got into this album. It's lousy and boring ... I prefer to listen to him in smaller formats like trio or quartet. From the first listening, I have been long wondering why this album is so preferably rated by people and critics ... Of course, this is NOT BAD, but far from highly recommendable. &quot;Plays Duke Ellington&quot; is so much better than this.<br />I know my opinion would be hard to accept, but again I stress that I bought virtually all CD's of Monk (nearly 60-80?) and haven listened to them over and over again.
B000007492|4.0|This album is near perfect. It's loaded with hits and is very fun to just sit back and listen to. I bought it for some key songs, such as &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; and &quot;The Logical Song&quot; which gets lots of radio play. Ever since I got it I can't stop listening to it, its just an all around great CD. Supertramp's music is both unique in the melody and vocals alike, and none of their songs are annoying and tiresome like many other artist out there. But one thing you have to take into consideration with a greatest hits album is how the tracks are put together. That is why I gave this a 4 out of 5. I would have mixed the tracks differently, I thought &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; should have been closer to the end and maybe &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; should have been one of the fronts. But that stuff isn't that important, and it doesn't really take away from the CD at all. In closing, this compliation was very pleasing and a delight to listen to.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|I usually enjoy Ron Howard Films&this is a Good Film but mainly because of Russell Crowe who to me Should have gotten a Co-Oscar for His Performance Here.I think He&Denzel Washington both gave Great Performance's thsi Year to Each get a Award.without Crowe's Performance this Film is another Long-winded film.the film glosses over many things in the Book&it hurts the film in that process.this film kinda reminded me of \\"Rain Man\\" for some strange reason.I think because the fact that Crowe is so Gifted as a Actor&His Persona was shaped rather well with the Role He was playing.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Simply the best movie of our generation! When was the last time  a movie inspired you to not only realize your dream, but tap your feet until you do so? <BR>Did \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", or \\"Castaway\\" motivate you enough to at least THINK of what it takes to realize a dream?<BR>No? Then \\"Flashdance\\" should do the trick. If not, then you must lead a pretty fulfilled life! <BR>\\"Flashdance\\" may at first look like a softcore porn set to music, but look--listen--deeper; you might find a little inspiration, if not through the movie itself then definetly through its music.
B000001GRE|4.0|After Listening to the Boulez version of Mahler's 7th with Cleveland it is easy to understand why this ensemble is considered among the finest in the world.  The rhythmic precision that Cleveland plays with is simply incredible on this and every recording they make (one passage comes to mind in the first movement where the snare drum and horns have a dotted sixteenth triplet passage that is executed so perfect you can almost see it printed in your mind).  The ability of the ensemble to match articulations, along with the rhthymic accuracy brings to mind an almost chamber music like quality to this recording. Many times while listening to this CD, I would forget that this was an orchestra and would instead imagine one instrument being played by a single musician.  I was also pleased with the balance of the orchestra.  Although I'm not sure if it was due to the ensemble or the recording engineers, every entrance of every section could be heard whether they were in a supporting role or in the spotlight.  The only reason why I gave this CD four instead of five were some intonation issues and musicality.  In my opinion the Clevelanders just didn't sell it dramatically speaking as well as the NY/Bernstein recording.  However this could very well be an attribute of Boulez's interpretation ( as sometimes he is refered to as the &quot;ice man&quot;, and in this particular recording as &quot;clinical&quot;).  However, those are just my opinions and in the end I feel that this recording is a must have anyways.

B00000DCHE|4.0|Billy Joel recorded a fair number of studio albums before breaking through to the big time with 1977's \\"The Stranger.\\"  Credit him for taking a chance and recording the live album \\"Songs in the Attic\\" rather than merely issuing a restrospective of his early career.  Some of these version are actually superior to the original studio versions, most notably the teenage ... anthem \\"Captain Jack\\" and the self-referential \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid.\\"  But even when not a substantial improvement, like with \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood,\\" or the ballad \\"You're My Home,\\" they don't lose anything.  Credit Joel also for NOT including his one pre-stardom hit \\"Piano Man,\\" the definitive version of which he had already recorded.<br />Overall, a solid live album from Joel that neatly sums up his pre-stardom career.
B000063S6Z|5.0|yeah, moby is a bald little genius, though many do not see his genius through their beer goggles. To those of you who hate moby and his music/message... sorry, but oh well. It's no big loss to moby i'm sure that you cannot appreciate his art, there are millions out there who do. To those who condemn 18, saying it is simple and formulaic, relisten to the damn disk already. Simplistic it is NOT, and formulaic? well i could argue that everything in this world, your review, thought process, life, little tv dinner, is formulaic (but we would all be here forever). So instead I say shut up and listen to what moby has done here. It doesn't sound like a formula to me, it sounds like music, good music for that matter.<br />So for those trying to decide to get this cd or not, my review says go for it. It's better than PLAY in my book, a lot better, and if you don't like it you can always get online and write a opinionated review that people can make fun of! (:
B00000DCHD|4.0|Billy Joel has always been better at producing first rate singles than recording coherent albums.  That said, \\"52nd Street\\" is (arguably) the best of his original studio albums.  Befitting the title, Joel flirts with adding jazz elements to his usual straightforward pop rock approach.  The album starts with three ace hit singles, the rocking \\"Big Shot,\\" the ballad \\"Honesty,\\" and the teenage liberation anthem \\"My Life.\\"  After that comes the strongest set of album filler material Joel has ever recorded.  The jazz influences comes through most strongly on \\"Zanibar,\\" the title track, and \\"Stiletto,\\" the latter of which features some of Joel's best ever piano playing.  On top of all of that is \\"Until the Night,\\" one of Joel's most underrated tunes and one of his best ever love songs.<br />Overall, a strong album from an artist usually more noteworthy for his hit singles.
0783225725|5.0|\\"How do you know what the world is like? Do you know the world is a foul sty? Do you know, if you rip off the fronts of houses that you'd find swine? The world's a hell.\\"<br />No, those lines are not from Clint Eastwood's 1973 masterpiece \\"High Plains Drifter.\\"  Actually, they were spoken by Joseph Cotten in Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 suspense movie, \\"Shadow of a Doubt.\\"  But no other words can better capture the essence of this darkest and bleakest of Westerns.<br />Clint Eastwood reprises his most famous role, \\"The Man With No Name\\" that made him a household name in such Sergio Leone movies as \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" and \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\\"  Some people claim this movie as a \\"revisionist Western,\\" but to me it is a little more complicated than that.  \\"High Plains Drifter\\" is a harrowing admixture of elements from such disparate works as \\"High Noon,\\" \\"Peyton Place,\\" \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" and Dante's \\"Inferno.\\"<br />When the Man With No Name comes riding into the Texas hamlet of Lago, he immediately strikes fear in the hearts of the local townspeople.  Hiding behind the facade of piety and the pioneer work-ethic lies a craven, dark secret which the town will keep shrouded at any cost.<br />Peopled only by bullies and cowards, the town is immediately torn apart by Eastwood -- executing the local goon squad who try to rough him up, raping the town prostitute, setting neighbour against neighbour and exposing the town preacher as a craven, hypocritical fraud.<br />It soon becomes evident to the town that the stranger has come to avenege the death of their marshal, who was bullwhipped to death in the town square as everyone watched, none of the men lifting a finger to help him or to stop the killers.  <br />So, when the stranger shows up, the Marshal's killers are about to be released from prison.  The cowardly town Sheriff tries to hire the newcomer as a gunfighter to face down the killers, but Eastwood turns the tables on him and the town and soon hasconscripted the town's spineless men in a local volunteer regiment to ambush the killers when they ride into town.  This is a neat twist on \\"High Noon,\\" in which Gary Cooper's Sheriff Will Kane had to face the men who swore to kill him alone, because no one in the town had the guts to help him; in \\"High Plains Drifter,\\" no-one has the guts to refuse the Man With No Name, for fear _he'd_ kill them.<br />What is so compelling about \\"High Plains Drifter\\" is Eastwood's complex portrayal of executioner and avenging angel: Unlike in \\"Shadow of a Doubt,\\" Eastwood is no sociopathic murderer, as was Cotten's Charlie Oakley; Rather, the town of Lago *deserves* its violent demise, and -- as in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" -- the Man With No Name icily exacts his revenge on the town ruthlessly, methodically.<br />In ripping the facade of religiosity and respectability away from the town, he makes the only man with any courage in Lago -- the town midget, played by Bill Curtis -- the Mayor and Sheriff. The sets -- designed and built by Hitchcock set designers Henry Bumstead and George Milo -- play a key role in this movie.  Like any other frontier town in any Western, the buildings are standard issue: General store, hotel, church, saloon, livery stable, etc.  But, they are all constructed of bare wooden planks, without a drop of paint on them, save for the signs denoting their function.  Clearly, these buildings are naked citadels of greed, earmarked for gouging every last dollar and squeezing every last penny out of their customers and parishoners.  Only the mining office -- which hides the town's dark secret -- is whitewashed over to cover its sins.  It's a brilliant example of Bumstead's minimalistic Expressionism.<br />The Man With No Name takes note of this, and before the killers' return, he orders the townsfolk to paint it a shocking, scarlet red.  The hotel owner protests, exclaiming \\"it's going to look like Hell!\\"  Of course, all Eastwood does in response is squint and form an impish, ironic smile with his parched lips.<br />The final scene is a brilliant deja-vu montage which recalls the Marshal's murder:  On a pitch-black night, the stranger horsewhips one of the killers to death, and guns his two partners down in intensely emotionless vengeance.  The stranger slowly walks away, finally cleansing Lago of its sin as the entire town burns in flames in a baptism by fire.<br />I consider this movie to be Eastwood's greatest directorial effort, slightly above \\"Bird\\" and \\"The Unforgiven.\\"  Singular in purpose, relentless in its dark vision of humanity, \\"High Plains Drifter\\" is the ultimate revenge tale.
B00004Y6NK|3.0|Released during the height of Eric Clapton's Phil Collins-produced beer commericial phase, &quot;August&quot; is one of his weaker original studio albums.  The first track, &quot;It's in the Way that You Use it,&quot; is a single from the &quot;Color of Money&quot; soundtrack that doesn't really belong with the rest of the material, but inclusion of which probably rescued the album from commercial oblivion.  After that is the tough Tina Turner duet &quot;Tearing Us Apart&quot; that is the album's highlight.  From there on, most of the album is the kind of lightweight fluff more suitable to Collins that to the man many consider the greatest rock guitarist of all time.  Only the mournful ballad &quot;Holy Mother&quot; shows any real inspiration.<br />Overall, a mediocre release from an artists who is capable of much better things.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington won a Best Actor Oscar for his role as a cop in this riveting and exciting story.  Completely, unexpected and on the edge of my seat.  I really did not believe I was going to enjoy this film in the least, my husband picked it out, but I was up for a good performance, hey the Academy gave him an Oscar....and so well deserved!  Ethan Hawke is the new guy just promoted into the drug unit to sniff out the and capture the bad guys.  And he soon finds out that Washington's characther goes about this anyway possible.  Is it right or is it wrong, which was is up, which way is down.....this movie will have you questioning right along with Hawke's character.  Excellent, I would highly recommend this for the performances and gritty story and unexpected twists.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel has always been better as a singles artist than he is at recording albums.  By condensing the highlights from the best part of his career (1973-1985) onto two discs, it hightlights the reason for his massive popularity during that time period.  The album starts out with a selection of his best pre stardom songs, including, of course, \\"Piano Man,\\" but also other strong cuts like the teenage loser anthem \\"Captain Jack,\\" \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood,\\" and \\"The Entertainer.\\"  Then comes a generous helping of songs from his 1977 breakthrough album, \\"The Stranger,\\" including the massive hits \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" and \\"She's Always a Woman.\\"  The second disc is then mostly a run through of Joel's succession of late 70s and early 80s hits, starting with the teenage independence ode \\"My Life\\" and ending with 1985's \\"You're Only Human.\\"<br />All in all, this is the perfect collection of Joel's music for the casual fan who doesn't want to splurge for all of the original albums.

But not before he added to the band's legacy two of the best rock songs ever written, the oft-covered classic &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and the equally poigniant &quot;Rock and Roll.&quot;  Those two songs highlight the album, along with the lengthy, mournful closer &quot;Oh Sweet Nothin.&quot;  In between, the album is not quite up to the standards of VU's amazing debut (&quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico), but there is plenty of the band's haunting signature sounds to hang your hat on.  The Velevet Underground was fated to be far more influential among fellow musicians than the record buying public.  Nevertheless, &quot;Loaded&quot; is a nearly lost classic that deserves wider recognition.
0316666343|5.0|I grabbed this book because I heard that it was THE book to read this summer.  I was not disappointed.  This is an excellent debut novel filled with wonderfully real characters.  It is at once disturbing and comforting.  I'd like to think that my loved ones who have died have pleasant experiences in Heaven like this.  This is an excellent novel, tightly wrought and full of light.  A great fast read for anyone.
B00005BL2A|1.0|I am a huge DM fan.  I have all of their albums and love \\"Violator\\", \\"Black Celebration\\" and \\"Some Great Reward\\".  However, it's apparent that Alan Wilder was such an important part to the music that DM's last two albums are failures.  ULTRA has it's moments, but Exiter has none.  \\"I Feel Loved\\" sounds like a B-side to earlier DM singles.  The rest of the album is was too personal and dry to listen to more than once.  \\"Dream On\\" was the strongest song on the album?  Yikes!  (I don't want to fall asleep listening to DM, but this album does the trick)  The last DM album I consider to be worthwhile is \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\".  Exciter is a huge disappointment from a band that seems to be directionless without Wilder.  Martin should have publically recognized his contributions and not shut him out.  Too bad...
6302800897|2.0|This was a really strange movie and very long. If you don't like courtroom scenes, steer clear of this film, because it is basically one long courtroom scene. I have to admit it really was handled quite brilliantly, and I give credit to the scriptwriter and the actors who were the lawyers for the fact that it didn't quite put me to sleep. I was amazed that in 1959, the situation about assault, rape, and ripped white panties with ruffles was so freely talked about. I guess the code must have been on its way out even then.<br />James Stewart was really the best thing about the movie but even he couldn't make it a wonder. The guy who played Pa Kwimper in \\"Follow That Dream\\" was the sidekick and helped a bit with the case.<br />I can't say I highly recommend this movie unless you're a diehard fan of James Stewart or courtrooms.
B000062TU1|4.0|I had read the HARRY POTTER books several times, so when I found out that a movie was coming out, I was eager to see it. I was not dissapointed at all, since it followed the book almost exactly! The plot (if you have not already read the book) is this: ... I won't tell you the rest of the plt, as it may ruin the story for you. I'd suggest reading the book first, as it helps to give some extra background information not totally clarified in the movie.

B000063CPL|5.0|This is one of those live albums that really FEEL live. It's like getting the whole concert experience and not just tracks with some background audience noise. Maiden is in top form and the set list is really good, a nice balance between old and new tracks. It's good to see that tracks from the Blaze Bailey period were included since and Bruce Dickinson sings them as if they were his own. I put this one on a par with Live After Death in sheer rocking power and quality of songs. Also, the Rio de Janeiro crowd is just awesome! They sing along to EVERY song and it sounds great! The two video tracks are a nice extra that only make you want to see more, I'll definetly be getting the DVD.
B000062TU1|4.0|I had read the HARRY POTTER books several times, so when I found out that a movie was coming out, I was eager to see it. I was not dissapointed at all, since it followed the book almost exactly! The plot (if you have not already read the book) is this: Harry (Daniel Radcliff) is a young 11-year-old boy who is an orphan and lives at his cruel Uncle and Aunts's house. Unexpactant letters begin to come to their house, yet for some reason is aunt and uncle do all they can to destroy the them. Finally, they decide to leave and camp out at a rustic old shack in the middle of nowhere. In the middle of the night, I strange giant (Hagrid) comes to the house. When he finds that Harry had not recieved the letters, he finally hands him one. He finds out that he is a wizard and heads off to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The scar on his forehead shows that while his parents died (not in a car crash as his aunt and uncle imply!) from the dark wizard Voldemort, he is the only boy who lived. I won't tell you the rest of the plt, as it may ruin the story for you. I'd suggest reading the book first, as it helps to give some extra background information not totally clarified in the movie. The actors, although many of them young, did an excellent job as their characters. (Daniel Radcliff as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione, etc.) I'm looking forward to CHAMBER OF SECRETS, the second installment in the series, as there are more events and action taking place. The reason I gave this movie four stars (4.5 actually) was because of some lack in development. Everything seemed to movie by very quickly, so there was no real understanding. Of course, if you read the books it wouldn't be a bother, but if you didn't you might find yourself questioning about the events occuring. The movie is rated PG for some mild language (there's not much, trust me) and scary moments (i.e. the huge mountain troll in the bathroom, forbiddon forest and 'Voldemore scenes', etc.) Appropriate for most kids 8 and older. Check this out on video/DVD (along with some extra footage) and be sure to watch for THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS coming out this November!
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis have managed to silence their critics that had written them off over the previous three years.  Heath Chemistry see's a return to their roots which will keep most of their long established fanbase happy.  The album opens with &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; (number 1 in the UK) and then what follows is what you would normaly would expect to hear from Oasis.  Yhe standout tracks on Heathen Chemistry are, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Songvird, Better Man, She Is Love and The Hindu Times.  This album wontwin Oasis any new fans but it will stop the dedicated ones deserting them.
0783233477|5.0|I will say it up front. I am a Brad Pitt fanatic. Ever since his performance in Kalifornia, I've looked forward the the way he explores and develops a character, sometimes adding very dark undertones that make you think. He does not go for easy solutions. <BR>I hesitated seeing Meet Joe Black because of the awful reviews it got, but I have found that with Brad Pitt movies, ignore the critics. And in this case, they are once again wrong.<BR>No one wants to think of death, let alone their own, and in watching this movie, you are forced to. The issues of letting go, of tidying things up, of being given the chance to do all of that, are raised, as is the very nature of death it/himself. Those who it comes for, and who are ready, see it and welcome it. Those who are not looking for it do not see it coming.<BR>My teenage daughter and I have watched the movie three times, and enjoy it each time. <BR>I think everyone, Pitt fan or not, should see this film. You will laugh, cry, and come away with a lot to think about.  The acting by all involved is superb, and the story is allowed to develop without a lot of fanfare and arrows pointing to guide the way. See it!!!
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is one of the standout albums that i have in my music collection.  When I first heard of System Of A Down, i brushed them off as a group that were cahing in on the craze that was sweeping the world, unitl my friend lent me their album.  The standout tracks are Toxicity (my favourite track on the album and one of the best songs that I have ever heard), Aerials, Pogo, Needles (for comedy reasons), Chop Suey and Psycho.  Toxicity is an album taht you will want to listen to over and over again without getting bored.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Granted.  Harry Potter has become one of the most popular literary icons in the world.  The books about a young wizard have done what other books were trying to accomplish: make people read.  I love to read, but I haven't read any Potter book yet.  When I get to read one, maybe my opinion about the movie version of &quot;Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; will be different because I found it to be a little too heavy and dark for a children's fantasy film.  The all-too-British cast do their jobs well, and the children -Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson -make this version watchable.  However, when I saw it in the cinema, I was trying to make myself comfortable in the chair because it was kinda long and dense.  The visual effects are good, and the music by John Williams fits the film perfectly.<br />As for the extras on this DVD, I was a bit disappointed quite frankly because there is only one short documentary in which the actors are interviewed.  The rest are glossaries regarding the world of Harry Potter that, probably, keep the children interested.  As I said before, I have to read at least one of the books.
B00006690G|4.0|It's not quite as hateful towards innocent people as his two previous albums, it's actually quite expected from him, although what I didn't expect was some of the ultra-sensitive lyrics about his daughter, Hailie.  SO CUTE!  Yea, well, I think it's great and some of the songs are pretty catchy, definetely a cd to listen to when you're angry, or working out.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|In my opinon, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" has been one of those movies that you love to hate.  It may even become a guilty pleasure.  The movie has a flat drama, kinda stupid characters (with few exceptions), and a romance filled with hollow dialogues that reminds me of the love scenes between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala on \\"Star Wars-Episode  II: Attack Of The Clones\\".  Hey, but at least Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale have more on-screen chemistry than Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen.  The only performers who have a touch of class on this Michael Bay film are Jon Voight as FDR, Colm Feore as Admiral Kimmel, Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, Dan Aykroyd as Captain Thurman and, especially, Alec Baldwin as Colonel Dolittle -these actors are great in their roles.  As for the main players...well...they are as flat as the drama.  The film's best selling points are the visual effects supervised by ILM's Eric Brevig, who won the Oscar for \\"Total Recall\\".<br />Thank God for this Vista Series DVD edition, which is truly fantastic.  The four discs are full of extras that are far better than the movie itself.  The making of \\"Pearl Harbor\\", as well as the production diaries, are outstanding extras.  The documentaries from The History Channel are very informative.  The making of the visual effects is perfect for FX fans such as me.  The only thing I really regret is that there is not an isolated music track with Hans Zimmer's spectacular score.  And let's not forget the package's presentation: I think the people at Disney did an incredible job in it.<br />In conclusion, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" fails in giving a very decent drama, but the attack scenes are very well shot, and that's something I've got to hand it to Michael Bay, in spite of the gory scenes in his director's cut, which I find repulsive and unnecessary.  If you ask me, I stick with \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\".
B000021YQV|5.0|Heavy these guys are excellent at writing lyrics and since rage against the machine isn't around anymore these guys are using they're anti govermant message. Anyway back to the album toxicity is great every song is perfect though you you will skip songs like jet piolit to get to songs like chop suey.My favorite songs are prison song,needles,chop suey,bounce,atwa,toxicity,psycho,and aerials.
B000001ELL|4.0|As a 7 year old, I remember this album being my 1st.  I knew very little of Kiss at that time (82), except what was on the album.  I grew up to hear much more RAW Kiss sound, but never forgot that album from my childhood.  I recently picked it up on cd, and relived some glory days from my youth.  Bottom line, PLEASE STOP TRASHING THIS ALBUM!  Why must this band in 1979, deliver another raw, murky, straight-ahead sound.  Can't they experiment and remain fresh and up to date?One of my faves of all-time from this band is \\"2000 man\\".  There is your sheer, raw power in your face!  The catchy song on the album is \\"Hard Times\\" -it's infectious!  Ace rules, and shows some real aspiring talent.  Gene's contribution, albeit small, are demonic as usual with \\"Charisma\\".  Paul certainly prefers the poppy approach, foreshadowing what we would see in 80's metal.  He get's it done as well, on the lighter side of things.  The only disapointment is Peter, whose one track \\"Dirty Livin'\\", is disposable.  Any song not mentioned means they are absolutely listenable Kiss songs with a new twist.  If you like underground or cult faves, or are the next member to join the already all-powerful Kiss Army, I order you to buy it.
0780623703|5.0|...I rented this movie expecting to see something like \\"Back to the Future\\".   The movie does indeed start out that way, and then it switches, rather than rely on comedy and cliches to cope with 90's meets the 50's, they show us what could really happen, and it is a huge eye-opener.<BR>...Yes there are minor flaws in this movie, you must accept the ridiuclous notion that Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are whisked back to the 50's by a wacky TV remote left at their house by Don Knotts, for no apparent reason. <BR>...the writers had more important things to do here than spend 45 minutes justifying something which had no importance to the real \\"meat\\" of the film. The same can be said of ANY movie - the point is, do these flaws damage the movie? in this case the answer is a resounding NO.<BR>...<BR>... This is a positively brilliant film, right up there with \\"American Beauty\\"    The script, the acting, the special effects, everything !   My only complaint is the courtroom scene, it reached it's conclusion too simply, I would have liked to have seen more bite to it.<BR>... For all of you out there who are capable of real thought, and real depth, and who enjoy surprise - DO NOT MISS THIS FILM.<BR>For those of you are too childish to understand anything other than Disney, do us all of favor and pack up for Pleasentville and stay there, you are not ready to cope with the real world.
B0000640SA|3.0|i give the limited edition set 3 stars, cause the supplements are great, but like everyone else, i hate the puzzle menus. most of the dvd sites (thedigitalbits.com and dvd journal) have links to the menu directions. watching the movie in sequential order is such a mind trip. it doesn't hold up to repeated viewings, though. it has a weird meandering pace. In order, the story is kind of lame. it's the characters and structure in the regular version that are the main points. I have both the regular edition and the limited edition. The regular, just for watching the movie, and the limited, to watch the sequential version.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|If you like the old black &amp; white musicals and want to see that genre reproduced in the 21st century you'll most likely enjoy this one (as long as you don't have puritanical values:-). It may well be the most colorful movie to date. The visual effects are spectacular! Musically, the skill of incorporating lyrics from Elton John, The Beetles, Nirvana, and other modern pop artists was very nicely done.<br />After hearing all the hoopla about the film, I was looking forward to seeing it. Hey, it is supposedly a great movie and I love Nicole Kidman, so I can't go wrong by investing a couple of hours watching it, right? Then I read some of the reviews posted here about how you will &quot;love it or hate it&quot; and found it more alluring. So I got some popcorn and set out on my journey. Well, I didn't HATE it, but sadly, it really didn't do anything for me. I can appreciate it for what it is, but quite frankly, after about a half hour, I went into the kitchen and started washing dishes. NOT what I was hoping for. (Yes, I kept going back periodically to see if I was missing something. I wasn't).<br />I viewed it as `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' meets `The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. A musical fantasy with better effects but without the chemistry or the rice.<br />I as I have sated, I don't like musicals. I'd much rather see something more realistic or weirdly captivating. NOT a film where the actors break into song for no apparent reason. It's not for me, but I still give it 4/5 for visual appeal.
B00004RF9B|1.0|While the movie &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is a landmark science fiction movie, and well worth including in anyone's media library, I cannot recommend the DVD version sold here.  The widescreen side is distorted, with characters and perspective appearing tall and narrow; and the TV-formatted side is dark, fuzzy, and poorly dubbed.  In my opinion, anyone interested in purchasing this movie for their home library should be sure to buy it in a brick-and-mortar store where they can view the version being sold to assure its quality.  That would hold true of the VHS version as well as the DVD version, since it is probable that the same distributor who made the DVD version also made the VHS version sold here.  I should have paid attention to other reviewers who have had the same disappointing result from purchasing this DVD as I have.  I am writing this review so that others won't make the same mistake I did.
0440217563|5.0|Since this is the third in the Outlander series, let me give you a brief recap first.  The books revolve around Claire, a 1940's post war nurse who falls through a circle of stones in Scotland, similar to Stone Henge.  She ends up in Scotland in the 1700's, meets up with a Scottish Highlander named Jamie Fraser, and goes on many incredible adventures.  What I probably like best about these books is the fact that it is told from Claire's viewpoint, on finding herself in the past and the amazing love affair with Jamie Fraser, who any woman would swoon over.  The first book is how they met, the second revolves around the Battle of Culloden, and this picks up with Claire, after being sent back through the stones in the last book, now twenty years later with her daughter Brianna, discovers that Jamie survived after the Battle of Culloden.  It involves her search into what happened to him, and her decision with whether or not to chance going back through the stones after him.  She then meets adventure with pirates, voodoo and discovery about the man she has loved all these years.  I won't give away the end but I have to tell you that I simply could not put it down till I was done.  I literally stayed up for HOURS one night salivating to see what happens next.  I can tell you with regards to the ending, and the whole book, is that it is like a fireworks show...it's exciting to watch the whole time, but the finale, with all those fireworks going off all at once with the excitement, is the way the end of the book was.  I was blown away by things in the end.  I have already started Drums of Autumn and I know from the author's website that there will be at least two more books in the series after The Fiery Cross, and I only hope there will be more.  I have never read books that captivated me more.  It is definitely not a traditional romance novel, which I never liked.  It is full of non-stop adventure, an amazing historical picture, time travel, an amazing romance and is absolutely addicting.  I have gotten two more friends hooked who weren't sure they would at first like the series either.  You have to read it but I will say you really need to start at the beginning with Outlander and go in order if you haven't already.
B000063V8R|5.0|This DVD set is a must for any star trek or sci-fi fan! The extras on the last disk have exalent insight into the background of the show from both actor and producer view points.  Many never before seen interviews and comments are included.  The menu interface is simple and good looking very easy to use.  If your a mid-way star trek fan this and the next two seasons contain the best of TNG episodes.  I would recomend to any big or hardcore trekie to get all seven seasons, not only for the great episodes but also for the extra info in the special features included in each season.
B00000ADG2|5.0|An education of Lauryn Hill and her music is in store for those who listen to this celestial freshman solo debut. The album is an audio-pictorial of Lauryn's experiences and the sandpaper-brazened emotions which she has been through. No-nonsense social commentary at its best, Lauryn is on her musical soapbox. <br />Here she is with her faults and her beauty, exposing her soul for all. <br />Enjoy this emotional album from the start to finish, at times the album feels like an old-school 1970s family reunion, especially with the children's unrehearsed interludes between songs. The gospel-like feel is praise worthy. The inside cover art allows us to see a strong, but also vulnerable Lauryn. A songwriter, producer, and artist whose background includes Hip Hop, Reggae, and R&amp;B, Lauryn has sweetly reminded everyone that the Soul is where its at.  <br />I'll catch you on the flip side,<BR>- Daz

B00004Z459|5.0|When i read Dan Lufts review of Hybrid Theory, i wondered what kind of music he listens to.  This CD has NO SWEARS and still gets powerful points across.  He must listen to dirty music full of swears and vulgarity to call this CD for kindergarteners.  I love this CD with all my heart and Linkin Park is one of the best bands ever.  Im not saying this because what they are doing is cool, but i hum to those songs everywhere and they are so good i can go hours listnening to them without getting sick of them.  Papercut, In The End, One Step Closer and Runaway are just some of the great songs on this alblum.  If there were more stars to rate this alblum I would rate this a 100.  So Dan, get rid of your junk and pick up a copy of this and stuff it because you just made many rock fans very unhappy.  And while you are at it, go back into your hole in the ground and listen to all the stuff you call &quot;Big Kid&quot; music and leave us true rock fans alone.  BUY THIS CD!  Cause in the end it doesnt even matter.
B00005T30L|5.0|Extremly entertaining movie. Not your usual toilet humor teenage coming of age movie. I've rented so many times I decided to buy it. One of my favorites of the last couple of years.
B000066NW0|5.0|Like a lot of people I bought this CD because I like the single &quot;Complicated&quot; which has been playing on the radio and MTV. After listening to the CD (several times!) you find that ever single track is just as good, and even better, than &quot;Complicated.&quot; It also keeps your attention with diverse moods, from the anger of &quot;Unwated&quot; to the  gentle &quot;I'm With You.&quot; This young singer is bound to become huge and established in the music community.
0792842073|5.0|Susan Sarandon plays Sister Helen Prejean, a nun who has been contacted, through letters, by Matthew Poncelet, a convicted killer on death row, played eerily well by Sean Penn.  This movie follows their relationship as they grow closer and closer to eachother until it can go no further.  Prejean, a loving, empathetic, and helpful woman is inspiring and amazing.  She battles her own personal struggles alone so as to continue helping Poncelet as much as she possibly can.  Poncelet is, at first, a harsh living example of brutality, mistakes, and most of all, regret and redemption.  Never swallowing his pride, he continually tries to convince those around him that he is innocent, he never killed anyone, and that although he was wrongly convicted, he is not afraid to die, and realizes there are no alternatives.  Just when you think he is as abrasive as he can get, there are some rapid twists in his opinions and actions, and finally, a tear is shed for a man who made a hellacious mistake, a man who feels sorrow for someone other than himself for once, and a man who finally opens up and lets someone in rather than playing the role of a hardened inmate.  The acting is phenomenal (in both lead and supporting roles as well; keep an eye out for a then-nobody Jack Black as Poncelet's brother), the script is impressively simple, yet complex, and this movie is brilliant.  A bit slow moving at times, it's all worth it in the end. Definitely a movie to be watched with a full box of tissue.. very, very well done.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Before I purchased this CD I had already purchased Diana's later release, The Look Of Love.  Having been captivated by my initial purchase, I decided to check out one of her earlier recordings.<br />Well, all I can say is that I was not disappointed!  Every aspect of this music has been refined to the nth degree.  All facets of her absolutely remarkable voice, her orchestra, and the arrangements are just impeccable.<br />The bonus track (number 13, &quot;Why Should I Care&quot;) brought tears streaming down my face within 30 seconds of hearing it, and has done so every other time I have listened to it since.  It contains some remarkable saxophone playing, which is rarely used in any of her other tracks.<br />You will NOT regret purchasing this CD, it is just unbelievable.
0553213105|5.0|And that says a lot!  Elizabeth Bennet is the second of five daughters in the Bennet household.  She is a lively and good-humored young woman of high understanding and an open mind.  However, she has one defect, she is too quick to judge.  Especially so when Mr. Darcy comes to her neighborhood.  Darcy appears to be of a reserved, haughty and proud disposition owing to his large fortune and noble birth.  Lizzy adopts an immediate dislike of him.  Mr. Wickham, whom Lizzy judges to be an amiable man, gives her further evidence of Darcy's unworthiness, and she is prepared to accept and believe it (She is prejudiced!).  Darcy notices all the defects of her rather embarrassing family, low-connections and inferior wealth in comparison with his own (He is proud!).  Just when you think it's a dead end, however, the barriers begin to crumble away as more and more of Darcy's real character is revealed.  Through more dependable sources, she learns that he is in fact a good-hearted, charitable, just man, and the most surprising and unexpected revelation, that he has more than a strong regard for her.<br />My favorite thing about this book is Austen's portrayal of society through her characters: the greedy and self-interested (Mr. Collins), the rich and snobbish (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), the small-minded and ridiculous (Mrs. Bennet and Lydia), the decietful and immoral (Mr. Wickham), and the kind-hearted and easily victimized (Bingley and Jane).  The novel is one of the funniest I have ever read, and so entertaining.  Mrs. Bennet seldom speaks of her 'nerves' or complains without making you laugh.  It is not a slow read either, despite the popularity of the novel there are plenty of unexpected turns to keep you going.  Beneath the entertaining quality of the novel there are lessons to be learned.  Lizzy misjudges Darcy, Darcy misjudges Lizzy, she misjudges Wickam, Mr Bennet misjudges Mrs. Bennet when he married her, and Jane (Lizzy's older sister) misjudges Miss Bingley.  It isperphaps eight months since the beginning of Lizzy's acquaintance with Darcy that she learns his true character, and every moment proves more and more how good a man he is.  I liked Sense and Sensibility, but I love Pride and Prejudice.  Lizzy and Darcy are positively the most adorable couple I have read.
B000003N7F|5.0|the second track, &quot;resolution&quot;, is probably my favorite song ever recorded.  buy this album if you have any remote interest in jazz.
0394492196|5.0|I'm a longtime Le Carr&eacute; fan, but I realized recently that it had been nearly two decades since I read what is undoubtedly his best work -- the Smiley trilogy. Based loosely on the Kim Philby debacle, this one is about the realization that a Soviet mole has been busy for many years in the Circus -- the headquarters of the British espionage service -- and the recently sacked George Smiley, a victim himself of the mole's machinations, is secretly brought in by a reluctant Whitehall to identify the culprit and clean house. It's the old problem: Who will spy on the spies? Le Carr&eacute; is a master of the telling detail, even with minor supporting characters, and all the inhabitants of this novel are vividly realized. This isn't a James Bond yarn, either, as the &quot;action&quot; is mostly in the form of reading files, interviewing agents, and hard thinking. And Smiley, fat, middleaged, and in secret agonies over his wife's habitual infidelity, turns out to possess unexpectedly heroic stature. This novel, and the two that follow, make up the best spy story ever written in English.

Now, By The Way follows up that huge success with even stronger material. The title track is now inescapable, and theres tons of radio hits on here you'll soon be hearing. Get ready. The Chili Peppers are still red hot.
0790729644|5.0|Recently at the Maui film festival, Clint had a chance to talk to us about movies in general and Unforgiven in particular.<br />To get an academy award for best picture you have to convince first the critics then the academy.  By definition, this group of people are old timers whom have always lived within the system.<br />Demographs in part explains why Unforgiven was so well liked by the critic's, and just above average with everyone else.<br />What I understand Clint to be saying is that he was trying to achieve something revolving around the good guy marshal turning out to be the villain.  He said villains usually carried no baggage.  Gene Hackman was a frontier lawman; he had roots in the community.  For \\"Gosh's sakes,\\" he was building a house.<br />I have seen Unforgiven many times including one of Clint's personal prints.  In am sorry, I did not see it as being that great.  I have discussed this with many people and I think I know why.<br />First off at no time did we see the lawman as a good guy.  Nobody I talked to took the lawman as the good guy.  People from our generation do not automatically see the cops as good guys.  As soon as we are passengers in cars, we are taught to look out for cops and go for our seat belts on sight.  A lot like outlaws of old going for their guns.<br />It was Clint coming in to protect the helpless woman that was the knight is shining armor.  The fact that he was a bounty hunter had nothing to do with it.<br />Maybe Clint was in Spain when L.A. had its riots.  Or that kind of news does not make front page in Carmel.  In any case, the people he played to, saw a different movie than us.<br />They saw \\"Popeye Doyle,\\" Gene Hackman as a good guy until his villiness became overwhelming.  They were sitting there accepting this violence in the name of law and order until they had to realize they could not stomach it anymore.  Many of us made that decision a long time before Unforgiven.  Maybe they gave Hackman the award for that.<br />Wyatt Earp was accused of Police brutality in Tombstone.  He was paid to sneak up on people, hit them in the back of the head to knock them senseless, and then stick them in jail to sleep it off.  He collected fines before he let them out.<br />The boys were killed at the OK Corral over a misdemeanor, carrying guns within city limits.  Some of them may have even been unarmed when the shooting started.  Some were found unarmed after they were dead.<br />Lieutenant Bascom just out of West Point was promoted by the US army, when he executed Cochise's family and friends for a crime committed after Bascom held them in custody.<br />In a Western filmed near Carmel by Marlin Brando, Karl Malden plays a lawman with a lot of baggage, a wife and a kid, but we do not see him as a good guy.<br />Somehow, I did not see this Western as different.  Our Hero was hired to do a job.  He recruits a force of heroes, meets the helpless villagers.  Overcomes the evildoers.  Is thanked by the villagers.  Utters an oath as he is leaving that if anyone hurts the woman he will be back and get them.<br />Great Western, but people I talked to did not see at as very different from ordinary Great Westerns./>Wyatt Earp was accused of Police brutality in Tombstone.

B000000HTM|5.0|The first words that came to my mind when I listened to this the first few times were, \\"Why did I waste my money on this?\\"  Now, it is in constant rotation on my CD player.<br />Why the negative initial response?  A few reasons: first, I had never heard anything by VDGG, so I knew no what to expect other than the group being a relatively little known prog band.  After years of listening to Yes, Gentle Giant, King Crimson, et al, Pawn Hearts shook me up a little...almost the same way Brain Salad Surgury did the first time I heard it.  Secondly, on first listen the mix sounded horrible--that very cheap, thin 60's/70's sound that certain groups had.  Fortunately, I listened to this on headphones and picked up the nuances in the mix..now it sounds fine, if still a bit dated.  Lastly, I was not ready for Peter Hammill's voice.<br />I am glad that I am patient with music, otherwise I would have never been able to appreciate this great band!  In comparison with other great prog recordings, Pawn Hearts is no Close To The Edge, Freehand, or Lamb Lies Down...it's darker, sinister, brooding.  To my ears, this would be the frankenstein recording taken from equal parts of Crimso's Red (the dark musical themes), Marillion's Fugazi (the sinister vocals), and Floyd's Animals (the overall brooding nature).<br />I won't pick apart the individual musicians, but give comparisons:  <br />Peter Hammill's vocals are (to say the least) an acquired taste.  Fish's early Marillion work (i.e. \\"Three Boats Down From The Candy\\") sound greatly influenced by Hammill, but Fish has better tone. Cross Fish with Syd Barrett, and you have a good idea what Hammill sounds like. <br />Hugh Banton's organ playing is incredible.  He is very progressive, without sounding like Wakeman or Emerson.  It is very different in style, sounding at times like Iron Butterfly's Doug Ingle, Mark Stein of Vanilla Fudge, and Floyd's Richard Wright.  He also played mellotron and bass (and/or bass pedals).<br />David Jacksonprovides saxaphone in an impressionistic jazz form.  Fans of the Canterbury style of progressive rock will relate...Jackson's style is closer to the sax players heard in bands like Gong, Soft Machine, etc., then with the likes of Raphael Ravenscroft or Mel Collins.<br />Finally, Guy Evans drumming, though also Canturbury-ish, reminds me of early Nick Mason mixed with a (not quite so refined) Bill Bruford.<br />Songwriting is key to this CD, and it all pivots around Plague of Lighthouse Keepers.  While the other two songs are strong, Lighthouse easily stands up next to Yes' \\"Gates of Delerium\\", Crimson's \\"Red Nightmare\\", and Mr. Bungle's \\"None Of Them Knew They Were Robots\\" as dark progressive masterworks.<br />My overall rating is 4-1/2 stars--nearly a classic.  Had this been recorded with modern recording technology and released today, it would fight for attention with the likes of Radiohead.<br />5 Stars - if you are a fan of VDGG, dark progressive music, obscure music, or adventure.<BR>4 Stars - if you are a casual fan of progressive music.<BR>3 Stars - if you like your rock a little more straightforward<BR>2 Stars - if you think Brittany Spears is da Bomb<BR>1 Star - you must like Aphex Twin.
080013558X|4.0|Annie is a delightful movie about a redheaded orphan who never stops dreaming.  Even when her days are bleak she keeps hoping that her real parents will come for her.  Annie not only has an optimistic view on life but she teaches the other people around her to keep hope alive. Albert Finney is the perfect actor for the part of daddy Warbucks. Albert Finney plays a gruff man who simplty enjoys making money until he meets Annie.  Annie is the movie that will bring a smile to your face and make you realize that dreams can come true if you keep hope alive.  Annie is a great movie that the whole family will want to watch over and over again!
0790743507|5.0|Next to An American in Paris and Meet Me in St. Louis (which I am dying to see), this is one of my favorite movie musicals. Gene Kelly gave one of the greatest performances of his life. I was first introduced to this musical by way of the Great Movie Ride at the MGM theme park in Disney World. It's the first thing you see as the ride starts. Then, I started singing it in my music class. Then, I saw a diaper commercial of a baby dancing in the rain to the recording of the song that obviously recorded by Gene Kelly. Then, in my third year at theatre camp, the tap class performed the number wearing ponchos and hats. They even had the number itself projected on a video screen. Actually the video itself was on mute and they were dancing to a recording. I knew I was in love with this musical. Then, I saw snippets on That's Entertainment and That's Entertainment Part II. I'm not sure if there were snippets of the musical in That's Entertainment III. When I bought this musical on DVD, I was shocked that there were 60 chapters. I watched it first on my computer because my parents were watching the Boston Pops' 4th of July concert downstairs. When I saw the movie sequence, even I thought that Lina had a lovely voice that matched her personality onscreen. Then, when she first spoke, I thought, \\"Oh my God, no wonder Don was upstaging her.\\" Donald O'Connor was very funny. His song, Make 'Em Laugh, was a celebration of how important comic relief is. I loved the part when he started singing, \\"Oh my little mammy/Down in Alabammy\\". I loved the flashback scene when Don was telling the story of his life. He was lying through his teeth, baby. Debbie Reynolds has become quite a star. She even sang Singin' In the Rain at last year's Boston Pops 4th of July concert and she was great. These days, she's doing the voice of Lulu, Granpa Lou's new wife, on Rugrats. I thought it was a little gross that they mixed milk with water to create the rain effect. I'll admit that it did make the rain look more visible but Gene Kelly must have had to take a long shower especially after the shot where he looks up and water pours on his face. Good thing they'll never actually invent Smell-O-Vision. This musical is wonderful. Practically all of the main characters get to sing except for Dexter, the director. Lina becomes a real villain towards the end. Buy the DVD and you will thank me.
B000066NW0|2.0|.......and unfortunately, that is the only good thing about this album.  The music on this CD is slow and just plain uninteresting!  I was never drawn into it and this is one of those CDs that will put you to sleep in no time.<br />\\"But dude, like, this CD is totally wicked!  I was hanging out at the mall the other day with a couple of my friends, and like, we were playing this at the mall the other day!\\"<br />Enough of this mallrat talk.  Avril is a good artist, but the music she performs just isn't good!<br />\\"Seriously, dude, you're missing out!  Like, I'm going to Mike's party tonight, and the whole place will be jamming to this CD!  There's gonna be this skateboard thingy goin' on there, people will be smoking ... and stuff.  Aw man, it's gonna be awesome.\\"<br />What is there to jam to on this album?  The first single she released is painfully boring!  And skateboard music?  What the ?????  You sound like you've been smoking ... already!<br />\\"Dude, like, you're the one who is painfully boring, dude.  Party on!  Mallrats in the house!  Yeah, baby!\\"<br />Who cares you high school reject.  Right now, I'm going to listen to \\"Spirit Room\\" by Michelle Branch.<br />\\"Michelle Branch?  Like, isn't she that Vanessa Carlton clone?\\"<br />Like, whatever.
B000066NW0|2.0|Yeah, i like the songs, they're actually pretty ok, but I agree with everyone that she is ver un-punk, her clothes are wannabe, and she should just say \\"this is pop\\" and be done with it. I give it more stars except for someone who is trying to be herself, she isnt. This cd is nothing special, dont waste ur money.
B00000JGEH|5.0|Even better than Alien and about tied with Predator, is The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous role, which he continued in Terminator 2 and the upcoming Terminator 3 which is being released in Summer 2003. Michael Biehn plays Kyle Reese, trying to protect Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor character from the time-traveling cyborg hunter. The special effects by such great Hollywood masters as Sam Winston (Jurassic Park,Predator,Aliens) delivers a great mechanical muscle man played with great cold qualities by Arnie, who picks up weapon after weapon, vehicle after vehicle. The music by Brad Fiedel has become a great staple for sci-fi film music.
B00000JGEI|5.0|Terminator 2, is even more fun and action-packed than the first one. I was eight-years-old when this came out, and was extremely excited! Ofcourse the plot concerns two Terminators sent back to kill John Connor, son of Sarah. One is the T-800, played by Arnold, the other is the T-1000, played by Robert Patric, one of my favorite movie villains. The excitement and horrifying tale never let up. For big T-Buffs, get the Ultimate Edition DVD, and watch the Special Edition which features tons of awesome scenes, which include Kyle Reese and some T-1000 special effects that are incredible!<br />The special effects are top-notch with Stan Winston returning aswell as ILM doing CGI work, that would later help make Jurassic Park the great film it is. What will be had in the future of The Terminator series? What kind of new action and science fiction will we see in Terminator 3? That question will finally be answered in Summer 2003.
B000068QVN|5.0|If you love the band as many do (including me of course) you will need to add this to your collection of GFR ASAP. Powerful performances including renditions of songs - Closer to Home, Gimme Shelter, and others -never heard on cd of the band as a trio. The sound quality is better than the Live 70 album though not as good as the more modern live recordings. The music is not always polished - sometimes sounds rushed and slightly out of tune ( Are You Ready on both accounts and Paranoid for the former) -  but for GFR fans that was okay as the energy and rawness of the music more than compensated. It is interesting to hear Footstompin' Music in its early stages of development ( it was recorded here in concert before its release on E Plurbis Funk). As said in other reviews you absolutely need to listen to the cd LOUD.<br />Next should be the live recording of the Madison Square Garden concert recorded for the &quot;In Concert&quot; TV show on the Phoenix tour along with an accompying DVD.<br />We can only hope.
B00005B238|5.0|Predator is one of the best action films ever made, aswell as one of the best monster movies ever made. The creature effects handled by the best monster creator ever, Stan Winston, are extremely terrifying and fun! The late Kevin Peter Hall played the Predator, who is even cooler than the aliens in the Alien film franchise. <br />The other actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and others play their roles with great energy and each character has his or her own set of characteristics. Arnold plays Dutch, a great Major, who leads his team threw the jungles only to be taken one-by-one by the creature, in classic monster movie fashion.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Absolutely the worst movie of 2001, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, PERIOD.  Even the beautiful Nicole Kidman couldn't save the movie.  When I saw it in the theater, I noticed that people kept getting up and leaving.  At first I thought they might just be going to the concession stand, but as more and more people trickled out and never came back, I realized they were leaving because it was truly an awful movie.  Less than half the original audience was there by movie's end.  If I would've been by myself, I would've left also.  Come to find out, my viewing companion felt the same way I did!  Too bad we didn't speak about it during the movie, so we could've left and spared ourselves the misery of watching such tripe.
B000001F7R|5.0|I've been a Def Leppard fan since 95 & this is the first time I've ever heard this CD. Like most people I was used to their Hysteria sound. So when I bought this CD a month ago & put it in my CD player,I wasn't sure what to think. The more I listen to it the more I love it! This is a pure rocker. My favorite tracks would be Rock Brigade, Hello America , When The Walls Came Tumbling Down, & It could be you. All the tracks are good though. There is not one filler on here. I would recommend it to the die hard Lep fan.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I really don't think this cd was that over rated.  Really, how can you not like it.  Every song is solid, and although there's nothing amazing or spectacular about, it still deserves credit for being a solid record start to finsh.  Well, that's it.  If you still don't own it then buy it and decide for yourself.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect when I got this album.  But after I listened to it, it was kind of like a time warp, stepping back into the '80's.  &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; are my two favorites!  For some reason whenever I hear any of those two songs, I think of that singer in that music video from &quot;The Goonies.&quot;  I guess it's because Madonna has a big influence on a lot of things, and to me she was the '80's.<BR>I almost got in trouble for singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; when I was on the ferry from England to France, and on the overnight train from Paris to Nice.  'cause Kristen would sing the Like a Virgin part, and I would do the Hey part.  It really made her and the others giggle.<br />*The remixes of Material Girl and Like a Virgin were alright, but I didn't like them as much as the originals.  (Too many extra sounds that distract and take away from the song itself.)
B0000584V3|5.0|i'm pretty sure that i wrote a review about this a long time ago, but it's been so long, i decided to write another one. this was my first exposure to opeth. i was browsing through a music store one day and saw blackwater park. thought the cover art was exceptional, and the name intrigued me. once i listened to it, my first thought was \\"man, this is just too scary\\" but as i perservered through the album, i was surprised by it's beauty. after being pummeled by non-relenting heavy guitars and death growls, you are suddenly soothed and healed by lush acoustic passages and clean vocals. it is somewhat like the calm after a storm. this can go both ways (the calm before the storm) because after you have been lured into a false sense of security by beautiful and, let's say, \\"innocent\\" music, your quaint little world is abrubtly shattered by the heavy guitars and growling vocals yet again-and you love every moment of it. (this is, of course, written from my point of view)<br />now, onto the vocals. when i first listened to blackwater park, i had very mixed feelings about them. the \\"dude, this is too scary\\" had turned into \\"dude, this is way cool, but still scary\\" i have come to the conclusion that opeth wouldn't be opeth if it lacked either vocal, clean and death. as a matter of fact, the growly vocals make you appreciate the clean and pretty ones that much more. probably what i love even more than the stunning music is the lyrics. dark, poetic, beautiful, and sad, just reading the lyrics is a rewarding experience in of itself. when i close my eyes and listen to the music and lyrics, it takes me places. it's like reading a good book, you can slip briefly or lengthily in and out of reality, if you allow yourself to. you can escape to a dark and mysterious forest clad in night, or to an ancient orchard amidst skeletal trees and shadowy crevices. and even to blackwater park itself, via the last track. each individual's personal discovery is different and meaningful in variousways to that person, but if you appreciate the beauty and magic of music, i can promise that this will let you go places you never thought possible, and experience things usually only visited in dreams. and that, my friends, is what music is all about.<br />all in all, this is a masterpiece, as are all of opeth's albums. though all tracks on this album are sensational, ones that stand out for me the most are Bleak, The Drapery Falls, and Harvest. Dirge for November is spectacular as well, but like i said, so are all of them. each opeth album is unique and has its own theme. since this was my first opeth experience, it will always hold a special place in my heart, seperate from their other albums, though each one is a musical journey that any music fan should not pass up. i recommend all of their albums. after listening to opeth, you will walk away feeling dazed and mesmerised by their genious. i hope opeth effects you in the same wonderful way that it did me. all you have to do is make it happen. enjoy...
B00005O5CM|5.0|The DVD has a trivia track, ala Pop-Up Video, with various interesting facts.  Check it out!  I wish more DVDs has this.
B00005NEUF|4.0|I knew nothing of any hype evident in the US, having only a couple of radio tracks and one sighting on a late night music video program upon which to form an opinion. Once I was able to remember the name of the band, I sought the album and chose this Import version. I'm so glad I did.<BR>It's not often I take to an album in this way (call me a hard marker!), but I have no reservations in singing the praises of &quot;Is This It&quot;. The irresistible &quot;Last Night&quot; (right up there with White Stripes' &quot;Hotel Yorba&quot;) is worth the purchase price alone, but throw in Hard to Explain, Modern Age, Someday, the title track and &quot;bonus&quot; of NYC Cops and we have something which stands out from anything else I've heard in a long time.<BR>Critics of The Strokes' sound are more than likely jaundiced in their views by such factors as pre-release buildup, musical influences and the backgrounds of various band members. I can only judge on face value and it sounds good ... real good. Mention has also been made of the crude strumming technique, bland vocals and sameness of some tracks. It may be a simple formula but it works. Raw yet shrewd. Familiar yet somehow original. <BR>I want to listen again.
B00005JLDW|4.0|I have always been a big fan of dragons, and this movie helped---alot!<BR>The story opens up with a young boy named Quinn going to visit his mother in a tunnel. The scene ends with his mother , along with 2 other workers, getting killed  by a dragon. <BR>The movie moves to the future where Quinn leads a rag tag group of English survivors; survivors of the battles with humans versus the dragons. Apparently the dragons have overtaken the world. <BR>Enters Matthew McConaughy aka Van Zandt. A United States Marine who has become notorious for hunting and killing the dragons. <BR>The animation of the dragons was top notch. Granted the action/dragon scenes were not enough but they did wet my appetite. Matthew M. was fantastic as the Marine gone slightly insane. He kept true to his character up to the very end. He made a personal battle out of hunting and killing the dragons. Quinn absolutely was the epitomy of the protector. He did not want to involve his people with Van Zandt, when he (Van Zandt) wanted to go to London to kill the male. Basically all the dragons are female and only one male. <a scene not to miss> The men of this \\"tribe\\" were telling the story of a struggle between father and son. The story was pulled directly out of the fight scene in STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. That is a scene not worht missing.<BR>Over all the plot was weak and pretty much so was the acting. I liked the guy who was Quinn. Fierce and determined but never comprimising his principles. The animation was supurb. The other thing that stuck in my mind was the build on Matthew. He looked good, however the body looked almost fake. I cannot explain it; it just did not look right on him. He should just stick to dramas. Not too many more action movies. <BR>This was a great movie for those who enjoy a little action and some great animation.
6304711883|5.0|Although this is actually a remake of a 1940s film in which the protagonist turns the tables unexpectedly on his child's kidnappers, this very well produced film directed by Ron Howard is quite contemporary and sophisticated. Mel Gibson shines as the controversial developer who has had shady dealings with union reps on his way to fantastic wealth, and is pursued unsuccessfully by the FBI even while they are suddenly called in to help on his son's kidnapping. When things go from bad to worst, Gibson takes control of the negotiation, and suddenly all hell breaks loose.<br />This is an entertaining and quite suspenseful film, wth a terrific supporting cast that includes Rene Russo as Gibson's wife, Gary Senise as a duplicitous local cop, and Mark Wahlberg as one of the kidnappers. The plot takes some interesting twists and turns, and although it is nt predictable, all works out quite well in the end. Or does it. In order to see, you'll just have to watch this very well made suspense thriller for yourself. Enjoy!
0345448898|3.0|I read the last book in the series, THE AMBER SPYGLASS two years ago and I'm STILL thinking about it.<BR>From a literary perspective, these books are gold. They're in more of an adult style than the Harry Potter books. In fact, these books, in more ways than one, defy all comparison with Harry Potter. They are completely and utterly different. These books succeed on more than just the way that they are written. If the muse who dreamt up the Harry Potter books had gone to someone other than JK Rowling, then the Potter books would have failed miserably. <BR>Now that we have that out of the way, we have the plot. The good? Pullman has dreamt up more amazing locales, intriguing and loveable characters (human and otherwise) and plot twists than many, many other writers could possibly attempt. Pullman has a gift for showing the reader a setting without bogging them down with too many details. Surprisingly enough, the only even slightly-clichd characters is the main one, Lyra Silvertongue (she starts out the adventure with a different name but I cant spell it form memory). Lyra is the token female rebel who refuses to wear dresses and runs about with boys. Thankfully Pullman has given us Pan to counterbalance her attitude, and their chemistry is wonderful. <BR>The bad? In the second half of the series (from about halfway through THE SUBTLE KNIFE onwards) the plot becomes a battle between humans and God. By the middle of book three, Pullman has completely erased the meaning of good and evil. Witches are good, (some) angels are bad. God is a weak, frail old angel, and humans were not created but were born out of \\"Dust\\".<BR>Parents-you should definitely read this over before letting your children read this ones, especially if they are young. The book openly denies the existence of God and even goes so far as to have him be killed. If you are religious at all, you definitely want to review this book first. Even if you aren't, the lines between good and evil are seriously blurred here, not a good example for young children. If you're Christian, Harry Potter is nothing compared to this.<BR>Otherwise, the story is wonderful. The characters are real, and you actually care about them. In every way a superior read to Harry Potter. But if you're even remotely religious, you'll probably want to forget HIS DARK MATERIALS.
B000002JST|5.0|I dare anyone to put this album on and tell me that their foot doesn't start to stomp...then your arms automaticaly go for the air guitar... I dare ya!!!<BR>The opening song of this exemplifies what the whole album is all about...pure...unadlterated rock and roll!<BR>Anyone not familiar with AC/DC should get this one and then work their way back to the one before it, then upwards and onwards to who they are now. Let it be me that states here and now that this album contains probably the best bit of guitar work in \\"Let There Be Rock\\". Trust me on this one...put this song on...and follow Angus... never...ever...have I heard someone play guitar like he does here... listen to the climax of the song...and by all means...please email me and tell me why this isn't the most powerful bit of guitar playing that you have ever heard. I'm a big Deep Purple fan, but I gotta tell ya...Angus and Malcom surpass Ritchie Blackmore's playing on \\"Highway Star\\" on this song. This song is probably one of AC/DC's most underated tunes to date. The rest of the songs on the album are just way to great to even get into. I can't even begin to elaborate on the vocal stylings of Bon Scott here because there just isn't enough time...suffice it to say that this is what rock vocals are all about! I would think that by todays standards, if any group had but one song from this album of this calibre, they would be headliners! If that isn't enough...listen to the last track...\\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\"...if that doesn't do it for ya...then all I can say is that your ears are painted on! No filler here folks...just songs that make ya go WOW!!Crank it up and enjoy... there won't be anymore albums like this coming out.
B000067CPX|2.0|Oh wow, was track 1 ('By the Way') a tease!  I was so excited when I heard their first single on the radio a month ago, and then heard it as the first song on the CD.  But the rest of the tracks... they sound like leftovers from 'Californication'.  It's like the first single doesn't even belong on this CD!  I wasn't expecting anything obnoxiously wild, but this was such a disappointment.  Sure, many people say the album is great... and they also say that the band has \\"matured\\".  Unfortunately, now they just sound like a lot of other [junk] on the radio today (read: boring).  I was hoping for something that would stand out, perhaps aggressive and individualistic.  Track 1 is it; the rest are not (save for maybe a couple other interesting tracks).  The majority may be pretty songs, full of good melodies and calmed singing, but that is definitely not what I expected from the Chili Peppers.  I began listening to them since 'Mother's Milk' and have bought their albums since, and always enjoyed listening to them develop through the years (I even liked 'One Hot Minute').  But after three full listenings of 'By the Way', I still only really love track 1.  A shame.
078324228X|4.0|Based on the story of the boxer, Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, who was framed for murder by a policemen.  Outstanding Entertainment.  You'll come away convinced he's innocent.   The power of cinema...see it.<BR> But remember, in real life, he was exonerated by the courts.
B000067CPX|5.0|An album in typical RHCP style; with a few surprises.
B00000JGOJ|3.0|In half a dozen subplots, 11 people live through the drama of their relationships and lives in Los Angelos.   The subplots seem independent, but come together in the end.  Although her screen time is no more than anyone else in the cast, Ms. Jolie makes the movie.  She plays a young, club-going type girl who starts a relationship with a young man who is HIV positive.  Her acting left a very strong impression on me.   In real life she is the daughter of the actor Jon Voight.  She is only in her mid-twenties and has made 25+ major motion pictures (check out Girl, Interrrupted).  I don't necessarily like her personally, and a woman friend of mine thinks she has had more cosmetic surgery than Frankenstein (check her out in Lara Croft, Tomb Raider).     However, I predict she will win an Academy Award someday.
B00005JLDW|3.0|If I had a choice between the comedy of \\"Dragonheart\\" and the drama of \\"Reign of Fire,\\" I would definately, without a moment's hesitation, choose the latter.<br />First of all, let's get one thing straight. This is not the fantasy dragon film you and I have been waiting for. As stated by a character in the film, there is nothing magical about these prehistoric beasts. They are as mortal as the dinosaurs in \\"Jurassic Park,\\" though infinately more dangerous (obviously).<br />The key to enjoying \\"Reign of Fire\\" is having the right expectations. This is not a pure, wall-to-wall action flick, which is what the ads imply. This is not even a fantasy flick. This is an apocalyptic sci-fi drama (key word: drama) about humanity, it's will to survive, the dangers, the risks, the rewards, the choices, the hindrances, etc, etc, etc. It bears the cliches of several genres, and while it never soars above its peers, it plays out like a breath of fresh air. Just don't breathe too deeply.<br />While \\"Reign of Fire\\" contains the occasional monster-movie-esque run/chase/trap/escape/fight action sequence, the dragons are not that terrifying. They certainly scare the film's characters aplenty, but the fear never translates beyond the screen to the audience. The fact of the matter is, the dragons are secondary to the two main characters of the film, portrayed aptly enough by Bale and McConaughey. Bale is dark and broody and McConaughey is truly psychotic. He chews up the scenes with the best of them (re: Gary Oldman) and he's loving it. His character is a total nutjob who, excluding the \\"party-crashing\\" scene, brings much-needed lightness to an otherwise overly depressing film. And geez, the guy is huge.<br />I was expecting to have a lot of fun with this one, but such was not the case. Lacking any jump-out-of-your-seat shocks or spine-tingling chills, the script is too bleak and dreary. The effect the dragons have on Bale and his band of refugees is readily palpable but oftentimes too burdening.<br />Character development is slight but sufficient, with Bale's \\"Quinn\\" being the most fleshed out. Scorupco's high-flying \\"Alex\\" and Bale's adopted son \\"Jared\\" had potential to be great characters but were severely underused. Disappointing but not surprising.<br />I wanted to fall in love with this movie, but alas, there are huge, distracting gaps of common sense in the script that don't hold up to scrutiny. Why do the dragons, supposedly super-smart, fight the humans singly when they outnumber them by the hundreds? How did the first dragon baby come to being with only a daddy to start with? And where in the heck did the humans get all that fuel and electricity?! But really, it's not worth dwelling on such flaws. Overlook them and \\"Reign of Fire\\" may just surprise you with its unflinching eye to despair and it genuine grasp of raw emotion. Plus the dragons look pretty darn cool. That is, when you actually get to see them.<br />It's a sad thing when the best scene of the whole movie involves Bale, his friend, and a bunch of kids, but no dragons whatsoever. It's a smart scene that resonates on several layers of meaning by paying homage to the concept of an oral myth passed down through the generations. Unfortunately, the rest of the script never reaches the same intelligence and it becomes obvious the screenwriters struck gold by mistake. They were just telling an old Stars Wars joke.<br />Another noteworthy scene is the elaborate skydiving dragon trap. It's stupid, impractical, inefficient, and ineffective, but it's an ultra-cool concept that results in some awesome visuals and the best thrills of the entire film.<br />All in all, \\"Reign of Fire\\" is an unusual summer flick that's smarter and darker than your average blockbuster. It certainly could've used a bit more action, a better climax, smarter battles, a lot of charm, and a huge dose of prozac, but the film delivers enough oompf to meet expectations.<br />One minor warning: Bale has a pretty thick accent and I couldn't follow alot of his dialogue. This probably didn't make much of a difference to my understanding of the film, but I found it very annoying nonetheless.
B00005ASOC|4.0|A famous, reclusive writer living in his old Bronx neighborhood improbably  becomes a mentor to a black teenager in the neighborhood who turns out to be a gifted writer himself in the making.   It's one of those triumph of the human spirit movies.   You will love the movie if you like literature or basketball.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Elvis in performance is the best of Elvis, the real Elvis. And this film catches the King at his coolest and sexiest. The earlier part of the film shows an impromptu, mischievious Elvis in recording sessions, which his films could never capture. He doesn't even have his hair slicked back! The major part of this film features a svelte Elvis in concert in 1970 in Las Vegas, taped over 6 performances. And this is why he will always be the King. Looser and more relaxed than the 1973 Aloha worldwide broadcast, in full control of the music the way he wanted it, Elvis was confident, sensational, electric.  The best recorded performances of Polk Salad Annie, Patch it Up, You Don't Have to Say You Love Me. New slants on his rock 'n roll pieces, his voice in better, more mature pitch.  This little piece of music history shows why the King owned Vegas during and after his life time.
B00005JKED|3.0|This is another phony black cop, white cop buddy movie. I feel the plot and relationships in these movies are not realistic.   In this one, both actors do great characterizations, especially Denzel.   It's very intense from the very beginning.  I was O.K. until about three-quarters of the way through the film  when the bullets start to fly, and it turned into just another...action movie.   Luckily, the good guy wins in the end.    Objectively, it is an excellent movie, but not my preferred choice in entertainment.
B000001ESN|5.0|Do these guys know how to MINE or what???!<br />This album, with \\"Hemispheres\\" before it, and \\"Moving Pictures\\" after it would compose a Killer Trio. The first time I heard this one I knew Rush would become my favorite band. And while the radio hits are great, there ARE better tunes Rush has done, even on here. Such as \\"Jaccob's Ladder\\" and \\"Different Strings\\". And while I really began to appreciate \\"Natural Science\\" only when I first heard it live, that song will always stand out as the quissensial Rush song ever. It is made up of all the neccesary ingredients for one killer Rush a thon--and all on one album!!!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Watch it. Outstanding cinematography. Good concept, costumes. Many characters characterized well.
B000001ESJ|4.0|...progressing towards Greatness!! It's already here!<BR>After the phenominal 2112, &quot;Kings&quot; provides us with a real showcase of talent for this band. I think this album is really underated. With the title track and not to mention &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, the first look at Cygnus (Cygnus X-1, Book 1) is just their best epic-type deal by far!! &quot;Madrigal&quot; presents a sweet change from the modern to the medieval, while &quot;Xanadu&quot; in it's original content is great---You just can't beat this one!<BR>It's a package deal for any Rush fan, and it is underated, as you will discover once your ears mature enough to appreciate it--I say this with experience, it took the majority a while to grow on me, but since then, I have come to love this album as well.
0783226004|3.0|Sneakers is a wanna-be thriller with a story line that is a mish-mash of government intelligence agencies, computers, encryption, spying, blackmail, and so on.  <br />Computers in large institutions give me headaches not entertainment.   Robert Redford usually makes quality movies, but this one fell short.   The components of the plot are cliches.  Without any good roles in the script, even this all-star cast couldn't salvage it.  <BR> <BR>Maybe I should point out that most other people liked this one!
B000067CPX|3.0|Iam a huge R.H.C.P fan and I was really anxious about the new album coming out. But unfourtunally all of the songs on the cd are slow. I mean don't get me wrong I like slow chili peppers songs. But not one fast song on the cd that is going too far. There were no crazy slap bass on the cd. That is very surprising coming from flea. I miss songs like &quot;Get On Top&quot; and &quot;Give It Away&quot;. I feel the band should come back with just on crazy cd with all loud songs on it to make up for &quot;By The Way&quot;.
6305313687|3.0|This is a skin head neo-Nazi movie set in Venice Beach California.   There are a few extremely graphically violent scenes.  The lead character is a skin head who is very intelligent.  He goes to jail for the murder of two blacks.    In jail he undergoes a change, and when he gets out, he doesn't want anything to do with the skinheads or Nazis.   The problem is that his younger brother who idolizes him is in very deep.  I found the story a little oversimplifed but tolerable.  It is a morality tale, but the morality probably won't be your morality.  In the end a price must be paid to fate.  It was entertaining.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This DVD is packed with just enough extras.  As it comes on two discs, it also does a nice separation so that you don't have to flip back and forth between the two...  <br />On disk one, you have the typical movie in the usual formats with the director commentary.  On disk two, the extras are all available.  This DVD does more than talk about the &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; or the &quot;Making of...&quot; filler that is always interesting, but seems to just to be the requisite extras.  The DVD contains a lot about the real John Nash -- from conversations with him discussing his theories to the real Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony. I particularly liked the discussion around the musical score and the discussion about how to communicate to the audience how John's disease was felt from his own mind to the perception of those who were around him.<br />As a movie, you probably already know that this won 4 Academy Awards -- so if you are a mainstream viewer, you will probably love it.  If you are not, you will still be impressed by the incredible acting of Russell Crowe.  The DVD I definitely give 5 stars.  The movie -- 4.5
B00003CXRM|3.0|This was over-rated.   It's just a goof with a great soundtrack.  They stuffed the movie with big names and  hatched-up a plot by stringing together as many southern legends and symbols as possible-chain gangs, floods, prison escapes, shady politicians, bank robbers, crooked Bible salesmen, the King Biskuit Flower hour radio show,  the blues-man who meets the devil at a crossroads at midnight, and on and on.   These sore thumbs were so glaring, it's almost an insult to the intelligence.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard John Mayer on the radio a couple of months ago and fell in love with his song &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, but thought that I could get by with just hearing it on the radio every now and then. This view quickly changed when my friend played me her copy of the CD and I immediately went out and got my own copy! I LOVE the sound Mayer gets from his guitar and his lyrics are really touching. They actually sound genuine, unlike many of today's popular singers, and added to the wonderful background of guitar and band make for a great CD.<br />As a side comment, I've heard that Mayer has been called &quot;The New Dave Matthews&quot;, and while I agree with this slightly, I would have to say that Mayer's soothing, yet upbeat songs allow me to easily differentiate between the two. I play Dave when I want something with a little bit of an edge to it (especially &quot;Everyday&quot;) and Mayer when I want to sit back and relax after a long day. I'd recommend both John Mayer and Dave Matthews to anyone who likes the sound of the guitar and vocals and also to those who want music that they can easily sing along to and make them feel good.
B00005JKL8|3.0|This was a surprisingly thrilling story about the rescue of an American pilot in the war in Bosnia.   The pilot's mission was to take photographs of the, \\"Killing fields.\\".   Upon rescue of the pilot, he also manages to rescue the photographs.   The Serbs are the bad guys. There is no gray.<br />The movie is loaded with special effects and explosions.   Gene Hackman is pretty good in this one,  even I have to admit.   I liked the actor, Owen Wilson, who played the pilot.   He looked and acted very different than most male actors would, especially in a military role.   He seemed like an average, regular guy, with a normal personality, which I felt drew a lot of credibility and sympathy from me, to his character. <BR> <BR>The film was based on a true incident.   Some of the technology shown was amazing.  I hope for our sake that we really have such capability.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|While watching this movie, I realized how much time and effort it must have took to organize all the extravagant sets and dances. The actors were magnificent in their roles(I believe Ewan McGregor was especially good in his role) and brought me kicking and screaming and to the plot. My only complaint is the fact that I hated to plot, but maybe that's just because I don't like love-triangles and what not. However, just because this magnificent production didn't please me that much, all my friends loved it and that is why I gave it 4 stars.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|The plot keys off an attempt by the allies to capture the enigma, the code name for the German encryption device used for communications between navel vessels. <br />The Americans became aware of a disabled U-Boat out in the Atlantic.   They built a submarine that looked like a German U-Boat.   They plan on sailing up to the German boat pretending to be another U-Boat coming to their aid.   The plan is to dispatch or capture the occupants, grab the enigma device and scuttle the boat. The Americans on the mission have been told that winning the war depends on capturing an enigma device, without the Germans knowing.   If the Germans know an enigma device has been captured, they will change the codes.<br />While scuttling the German boat, its torpedoes accidentally fire and sink the American one.   The surviving Americans and their prisoners must occupy the crippled German sub and sail safely to the allies.   It is at this point when the best action scenes take place.   The combat scenes between the American-occupied U-Boat and a German naval Vessel they encounter are very thrilling.    On the U-Boat, there are several gruesome hand-to-hand combat scenes between the Americans and their German prisoners. <br />Like most action movies, this one stretches credibility like a rubber band.   It stretches the rubber band to the breaking point to make me think that an already disabled U-Boat, after an attempt at being scuttled, is still able to submerge and function<br />In most war movies, U-Boats are portrayed as attacking other military vessels.  In reality, the job of the U-Boats was to attack commercial ships, to cut off allied supplies.  Rarely did they go against armed military vessels.<br />In U-571, there is an isolated scene where a U-Boat comes across a boat full of allied sailors adrift at sea.   The Germans machine-gun them all.  In reality, the U-Boats were under orders not to take on survivors because they didn't have the space, but it was not the norm at all toshoot survivors.  In fact, there were many instances of U-Boat crews giving provisions and providing directions to allied sailors adrift in lifeboats.  Their job was not to kill people but to sink allied freight.<br />There was one human drama of interest in the movie, but it was not explored fully.  The executive officer of the Americans was a man who had just been passed over in an appointment to captain a ship.   When he confronted his superior as to why, he was told that he wasn't ready. His superior told him he must learn that in making decisions, he must take into consideration the lives of the men under him.   When the captain of the submarine dies, this executive officer is now in charge.   The drama that occurs is that he is unsure what to do about anything.   Harvey Keitel counsels him that for the sake of the sailors, a commander must always know what to do, even when he doesn't.  The rookie commander comes into his own as the drama nears conclusion, but he achieves victory at a great cost in the human life of his own crew.    Remember, on both sides, the sailors were mostly in their late teens and their immediate officers were in their twenties.  A captain in his thirties was an old man.<br />War movies have evolved so that there are certain arch-typical characters we've all come to expect.  U-571 gives at least a half-hearted nod to the tradition.  Harvey Keitel, plays the role of the old sea dog, a World War I submarine veteran, who respectfully, but forcefully, gives advice to the green commander.   Another actor plays the young German American who is assigned to the crew because he speaks fluent German.   The original captain selflessly waves off his executive officer as he drowns at sea.   Other than that, there is little to differentiate most of the characters from one another.  Most of the Germans look like most of the Americans.<br />I've never been favorably disposed towards action-adventure films.   This one is entertaining but definitely notone of the year's best. <br />For a more authentic U-Boat movie, I suggest you go to the foreign movie section of your video store and checkout, Das Boot.   It is a German-made movie about a U-Boat and crew being depth-charged by the Americans.   It is a classic, and it is very gripping.
B000056K04|1.0|Having been a fan of Dave Matthews Band for quite some time now, I get very excited when any of their new stuff comes out.  When I heard that Dave Matthews Band had switched from Lillywhite as their producer to Ballard, well I was shocked and very afraid.  And as it turns out, my fear was justified.... I always liked Dave Matthews Band for not conforming to the standard rock and roll mold, but this cd makes them just another band.  I heard the music off this album and almost [became sick] all over my computer...I immediately saught some relief from their original recordings with Lillywhite that never were released.  I did buy this cd, but I think Dave Matthews Band owes [$$$]to everyone who bought this cd...I hold high hopes for this new Busted Stuff release, too bad that they only have two new songs on it...I'm glad they decided they really do need the Lillywhite stuff.
0792165020|2.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley is the story of a young, gentleman psychopath set in 1958 in America and Europe.  Mr. Ripley, played by Matt Damon is a young man with a terribly negative and destructive self-image.  He tunes pianos at Princeton University for a living but wears a dress jacket with the Princeton logo on the pocket.   A captain of industry type sees him tuning a piano at a concert, assumes he went to Princeton and asks him if he knew his son, who went there.   Mr. Ripley pretends he did.   The wealthy man asks if Mr. Ripley would go to Europe and convince his playboy son to return.  He is going to pay him for this.  Mr. Ripley goes to Italy, finds the son and pretends to have known him at Princeton.   He becomes a parasite.   Mr. Ripley convinces the son to let him live in his house, go on vacations, with him, share his life, etc.  Mr. Ripley greatest desire is to live  just like the tycoon and the playboy.   In achieving his goal, the con man gradually morphs into a murder.    The shame of all this is that Mr. Ripley is a multiply talented man and through legitimate means could probably have achieved anything he wanted.<br />The cinematography is excellent.  There are brief, visually stimulating scenes of a street in New York's meat packing district and of Italian villages.   Both characters were into modern jazz.  The few Jazz club scenes and sounds were magnificent.   It's fun to see how the privileged and moneyed youth of the 1950's enjoyed themselves in Europe while we imagine ourselves doing the same.   Unfortunately, none of this could compensate for the story, which has no redeeming value or interest.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B000002OX7|5.0|Unlike the latter part of the decade known for its kitsch and Disco music, Rock entered the 70's with a bleary eyed hangover experienced after pulling a decade long all-nighter - jimi, janis and the beatles were gone - Altamont, Manson and Heroin replaced peace love and understanding, it was a new dawn and for one perfect moment in time the stars aligned and Rock's biggest stars actually became their most creative artists - the Who, Stones, The Kinks, Neil Young - each came out with their seminal albums through their own different paths and Rock music was never again the same. Who's Next reflected a greater optimism and sense of purpose than the Stones dark moods in Exile on Main Street or the Kinks bent toward nostalgia on Village Green but it was hard earned and paid for and stands the test of time as the Who's greatest acheivement.
B00005JLDW|5.0|I found Reign of Fire to be an awesome and mezmerizing edge of the seat movie. The acting was great and the combination of action, drama and light humour made it worthwile seeing. I'm tired of the \\"cops and robbers\\" as well as victimization of females movies out there. It was refreshing to see a good scifi for a change
6301966988|2.0|Whoopi Cushion, uh, Goldberg, is very funny in GHOST.  But beyond Whoopi, the film's entertainment value plummets. Why? Demi Moore's character is so darn stupid! The scene that blew it for me: Demi stands there in frozen panic watching the murder of her boyfriend, played by Patrick Swayze. You won't even run for help, Dummy, uh, Demi? Just hang around gawking as Patrick gets killed! It reminded me of those \\"Superman\\" episodes where thugs beat up Jimmy Olsen while Lois Lane stood there like a wax figure. Women!
B000067CPX|3.0|I'm a serious RHCP Fan, going back to even their first album...how great were even early songs like \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\"  and \\"Jungle Man\\" and \\"Pappy du Plenty\\" and \\"Backwoods\\"... Then came Mother's Milk and you knew this was a special band. Then we get 3 great albums in a row: BSSM, the very good and under-rated One Hot Moment, and their very best, Californication.  Now... I know some people are Disappointed with By The Way, and I'd agree it's not as STRIKING as those albums above. BUT there are some really GOOD songs on this Album.  I feel that it would be 100 percent better (maybe more like 300 percent better) if the Dullsville songs like \\"Universally Breaking\\", \\"Dosed\\", and \\"Zephyr Song\\", just were left off the CD.... and in the first 6 songs, these are 3 of them !  So you start off, right off the bat, with every other song being kind of Sappy/Sweet and/or boring.  Then there's \\"Cabron\\" and I just can't take this song... it's just a silly chant of \\"Cabron\\", some cheesy pseudo-Hispanic song that no latin artist would put out....BUT, if you DROP those 4 songs, then the rating on this CD goes AT LEAST to 4.0! Now here's how the good songs shape up: 1) THE VERY BEST: A) \\"Don't Forget Me\\"  B) \\"Warm Tape\\"  C) \\"Midnight\\"  D) \\"Throw away Your Television\\"  2) THE NEXT BEST GROUP,Great B-side songs: A) \\"This is the Place\\"  B) \\"By the Way\\"  C) \\"Venice Queen\\" (very nice this one)  D) \\"On Mercury\\"  3) OTHER INTERESTING SONGS: A) \\"Can't Stop\\" (pulsating rap) B) \\"Minor Thing\\" (touch of funk rap) 4) SONGS I CAN TAKE OR LEAVE: A) \\"Tear\\"  B) \\"I Could Die for You\\".  So in my opinion, there's at least 8, maybe 10 REALLY GOOD songs on this CD.  Right now, I can't say that any of my favorite 4 songs are \\"Classics\\", but my opinion of this CD has improved after each listen, so very likely I will eventually consider at least a couple to be among their Top 20 or so best songs ever!!  The name of this album should have been \\"Haunted\\", by the way, because that's how alot of the songs sound...
B000001Y79|2.0|This CD is pure pop w/a bit of Ska mixed in. The ska is what saves it from being horrible. I do like Excuse Me Mr, has a more punk feel and Don't Speak is a terrific little love ditty. Have you seen this band live? Ugh. I had to leave their Halloween 96 show because of Gwenny's screeching. Maybe she's taken voice lessons, but that show was horrid. Luckily Face to Face made it worthwhile. She was hot when she had some chub, but now she's not so hot w/this ... glam look. I will never purchase another No Doubt CD and this one's going to eBay. If only they kept to their more-ska roots instead of where they are now as rulers of the POP world in cutesie punk/ska/rockabilly clothes. They remind me of the term sell-out.
6305181772|5.0|I don't know why I like this film as much as I do.  Looking over the reviews here and seeing a lot of the rather mediocre reception, and lauding of such scenes as the CIA breakin and Chunnel chase as the best in the film and 'reasons for buying', I wonder, what IS it I'm so fascinated by?  Because for sure, even though the aforementioned sequences are definitely ranking high on a cool-level, they're not my favorites by far.  They're not close to why I like the movie.<br />So WHY?  Let me examine.  Ethan Hunt - he's not the flashy, trigger-happy action hero that 'gets the girl' in so many modern blockbusters.  In fact, the guy only picks up a gun once in the entire movie, and doesn't even fire it.  (Too bad this all went down the drain in M:I-2, a sequel which felt like a parody of this.)  The top of his class in the IMF - Impossible Mission Force - Ethan likes to be quick and effective.  He doesn't like needless killing.  As a plus, he resists his love interest, Claire, because he respects her marriage to his boss (Jim Phelps)...is this unheard-of?  The movie is free of any sex. (!) As a result of all these traits, and the complete gut-wrenching mess Ethan is put in for the duration of the film, he ends up as quite a likeable character.  And that's the heart of it.<br />The plot - I hear over and over about how it's 'so confusing', but it's not.  You only need to be an attentive viewer.  This movie wasn't made for people with short attention spans seeking a few thrills and wowzer action effects.  It requires you to PARTICIPATE...what a concept! - and one I greatly appreciate.  Every piece of the story unfolds perfectly onscreen, but if you're being lax, you'll miss it.  It's almost as if you're going on a detective mission WITH Ethan, and you're just as surprised as him when things start clicking.<br />So what are my favorite parts of the film?  The vault infiltration and Chunnel ending sequence get so much recognition that I sometimes wonder...am I simply nuts forabsolutely loving the way Ethan's final chat with Phelps goes?  'It was Kittridge,' Phelps says, trying to sound convincing (and he will to the nonattentive viewer)...but Ethan knows better, and it shows as he replays all the events of the Prague mission out in his mind.  And it's no fun either, because Phelps is his boss and friend.  Then he asks the encrypted question...'Why, Jim, why?'  Assumed to be 'Why would Kittridge do it', it's really 'Why would YOU do it?'  <br />It's stuff like this that makes the movie work on a personal level for me, and I have no idea exactly how it pulls off.  I've heard over and over the 'all style no substance' criticism plastered on and it just goes right over my head.  But oh well.  I'll enjoy my Mission: Impossible, thank-you-very-much, and critics can take their views elsewhere.  This'll always remain one of my very favorite movies - it just don't get old.<br />'Bloody brill', indeed.  Buy it.
B00000634J|5.0|It's tough to imagine, but this is the best collection of Lennon's best songs to date.  Don't be fooled by that Box Set.  That contains an odd collection of outtakes, redubs, early studio Beatles works and interviews.<br />These are the single edits of the hits that made the charts and some that didn't.  If there was any one album that covers Lennon and his magic (it's impossible), this is as close as one gets.<br />If you are a marginal Lennon fan, this is your CD.  If you are a completist, you already have all these songs.  It is nice, however, to have them all one disc - even if there are only twenty masterpieces.
B000000OA6|5.0|To this day-and this is after having had-and loving 'Innuendo' for almost twelve years now-this album still blows me away for many reasons. One? The songs. (&) Two? The collective brilliance of how Brian May,Roger Taylor,John Deacon-and most stupefyingly-Freddie Mercury defied the odds and crafted such a stirring swan song as 'Innuendo'. How Is It that one man can sing better than he ever had (oh,did he...) and be thisclose to succumbing to terminal illness? My Lord: \\"Innuendo\\",\\"The Show Must Go On\\",\\"Headlong\\",\\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\",\\"Delilah\\",\\"All God's People\\",\\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\"....<br />It's been said that upon learning his time was very limited here on earth,Freddie insisted he and Queen return to the studio pronto and do as much work as God would give them time-wise... As Brian May has said in interviews following Freddie's passing in autumn 1991,Freddie was typically only physically able to sing what he did an hour or two at a time each recording session until he was unfortunately spent by the rigors of his illness.. Only to try again until he just couldn't do anymore that day by propping himself up against the console and having a crack at it all again: Never Giving In. Let THAT be a lesson to ANYONE about it not being how much time you put into something you do,but How Much The Time Vested COUNTS. Freddie could sing in an hour's time in a studio what ten vocalists couldn't in a week's time... Need a better picture of what I mean here? Then hear 'Innuendo' front to back: from the amazing opener \\"Innuendo\\" through to the more-apt-than-apt album closer \\"The Show Must Go On\\"(which features some of Freddie's most...unreal yet very real....singing ever heard).<br />Amazing,AMAZING stuff. Let there be no mistake though: as fine as everyone's performances are on 'Innuendo',Freddie basically steals the show here with 'Innuendo' as being as super-human a vocalist and spirit as he so certainly does on 'Innuendo'. Don't be swayed by all of these 5 star reviews and have a cynical tongue in that cheek there: Freddie never sang this amazingly; his range even got more broader and intense than at any other time in Queen's history... But moreover,'Innuendo' contains some of THE Very Best Queen material ever released. Period. (And,no,I'm not being too sentimental in light of how the band ended with Freddie's death. This Record-By Itself-Is Brilliant. Period. ) Every element that ever characterized Queen up until 'Innuendo' with all sorts of facets that seal the deal in how 'Innuendo' is as timeless and solid a Queen album as even 'A Night At The Opera','Sheer Heart Attack','The Game' or 'Queen II'. Perhaps moreso 'Innuendo' than the other albums for it's overall scope of content and it's true from-the-gut intensity. I can't say enough words that hit the mark enough to give this album justice. I can only hope any one of you reading a review like this here can find out for yourself by buying and listening to 'Innuendo' for yourselves...<br /> I'm still blown away by what Freddie had pulled out of his soul for 'Innuendo'(he and all of Queen),and the heartwarming fact that all four members bandied together as productively as they had and brewed up such a potent,potent album that has all of their whimsy,humor and good spirits served up with a fitting,superbly-poignant overall-dose of grasping one's own mortality-staring in the face of it as if to say \\"I dare ya to take me when I've got THIS to do yet!\\" -and THEN creating said album. (If you should find yourself into 'Innuendo',the posthumously-released 'Made In Heaven' record from 1995 is worthy of mention; for it contains the very last studio sessions of what began with 'Innuendo'.. Fine album in itself..) <br />Above ALL else: one of the best pop/rock star personalities ever; one of the most naturally-charismatic frontmen of any genre of music (And Queen is many genres; as 'Innuendo' but one example attests...) and above any tragedy or any sexuality,Freddie Mercury was,is and remains one of the most gifted vocalists,musicians and songwriters ever. But Mostly,after knowing him through the music and times of Queen,he stands tallest as being as truly beautiful a person as he was. Period. Ask any self-respecting singer in just about any band or outfit and I'm sure they'll be quick to give Freddie his due props in admiration,affection,respect and awe for the vocal chops and command Freddie Mercury most certainly had (and has; as records=immortality). God Bless You Always: Freddie and the surviving members of Queen. 'Innuendo' is as good as it gets in serving up an unfortunately-premature salvo to such a legendary career. Yep; 'Innuendo' is one of the most solid,all-around brilliant records Queen has EVER made. ANd imagine that it was the last one made and released while Freddie Mercury was alive...<br />Who better than them to lay claim to that? After all,they've created so many timeless and incredible songs and albums since 1973.. It's so beautiful that they captured every element of joy and duress as they have with 'Innuendo' and with Freddie hanging on as brilliantly as he did while having the grace to accept his fate as he did.<br />Brilliant album overall. Do yourself a favor and check it out/buy it.<br />Thank You,<BR>Tim Goyer<BR>USA
B00000F566|5.0|DIRTY DANCING is still the ultimate guilty pleasure (runners-up include FLASHDANCE and TOP GUN).  The film shot Patrick Swayze into the realms of super-stardom and spawned two hit albums and a touring concert event.<br />Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey - BOUNCE, TV's \\"Friends\\") is vacationing with her parents and older sister at a resort in the Catskills.  There, she meets dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze - GHOST, CITY OF JOY).  The two opposites immediately attract when Johnny's knocked-up dance partner (Cynthia Rhodes) has to get an abortion leaving Johnny to find a replacement - quick.  Baby volunteers, and so begins the glittery, music-filled love story.<br />The film also features Broadway veterans Jerry Orbach and Kelly Bishop as Baby's parents.<br />This new Special Edition DVD includes the full 'Dirty Dancing Live in Concert' which included performances by Merry Clayton and the original dancers from the film.  There is also the trailer, behind-the-scenes footage and a commentary track.
B00000ILE7|4.0|This is a great film, a dark and gothically-styled psychological thriller with plenty of action. If this movie wasn't as it is, the whole series would have fallen apart as a somewhat better than average string of shoot-em-up sequels after the classic original Alien. Admittedly Aliens was an excellent film, but I, as a long time fan of classic psychological horror authors like HP Lovecraft, find this movie to be an absolutely excellent thriller, nearly equalling Alien in quality and exceeding it in production quality. <BR>  After surviving the first two films, Ripley finds herself once again thrust into a losing situation. Stranded on an isolated prison colony, with a group of prisoners whose bleak situation neatly parallels her own, Ripley is forced to find the inner strength to survive yet again. In her delimma she manages to forge some deep but rather transitory bonds with her odd set of fellow outcasts. An excellent group of actors portrays this group of prisoners, with strong performances all around. The Alien is as virile and lethal as ever, and Sigourney Weaver turns in an excellent performance as well. The unescapable byzantine maze of the complex where the plot takes place is perhaps the most compelling character of all, forcing every other to find their own motivation to survive. This is a far better film than Alien Resurrection in my opinion. My advice? If you like space shoot-em-ups, end the series with Alien Resurrection. If you like the classic space-horror of the original, end it with Alien 3.
B00005ATQH|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's film version of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel LOLITA is one of his most under-rated masterpieces.  Boasting fantastic performances by James Mason, Shelley Winters and Peter Sellers, it is a fantastic social commentary.<br />Humbert Humbert (James Mason - NORTH BY NORTHWEST, A STAR IS BORN) is newly-arrived in America.  Deciding to start afresh in a small town in New Hampshire, he inquires at the house of the floozy Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters - THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN?) about the possibility of renting her spare room.  The clinch to the deal according to Humbert is Charlotte's beautiful young daughter with the &quot;lovely, lyrical, lilting name&quot; - Lolita (Sue Lyon).<br />Soon Humbert and Charlotte are married but he still feels very attracted to young Lolita.  After Charlotte convieniently gets run over and killed by a car, Humbert takes Lolita and starts again in another town.  But the mysterious Claire Quilty (Peter Sellers - DR STRANGELOVE, THERE'S A GIRL IN MY SOUP) is always lurking in the background.<br />The DVD includes the trailer.
B000068QY7|4.0|I'm not a huge Oasis fan, hence I can say that I wasn't impressed with &quot;Standing...&quot; or even with &quot;be here now.&quot;  Neither had the instant accesibility or the musical sophistication of &quot;Morning Glory,&quot; truly one of the best albums of the 90's (perhaps of all time).  However, &quot;Heather Chemistry,&quot; is a solid album, that has a few songs which rival the beauty of that album.  It opens with &quot;Hindu Times,&quot; which instantly draws you in, and seamlessly blends into the second track, &quot;Force of Nature,&quot; a fun song.  Other highlights include the quieter (but still catchy)songs &quot;songbird,&quot; and &quot;she is love.&quot;  Normally I don't like their non vocal tracks, but &quot;A Quick Peep&quot; actually worked for once.  There are only two or three tracks on the album worth skipping.  Overall, it's quite good, possibly the best release so far this year (though I liked The Strokes and the new Counting Crows also)  8.5 out of 10.
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is a good greatest hits it includes all of Madonna's hits from the early 1990s to the less popular now songs.  If they really wanted to include all of her hits they should have put on the songs that they did not put on the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; such as &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;.  This is a decent album but disappointing to a Madonna Fan such as myself.
B00005JLDW|2.0|There is an entire flock of summer movies that get released every June/July/August with high hopes for capturing the hearts, minds, and imaginations of viewers everywhere.  Some of these films are destined for the trash heap; some of them end up being rushing to the video and DVD market; while some of them are loosely penned with the hopes of a destiny to become a major motion picture franchise.<br />REIGN OF FIRE succeeds as little more than a modest budget popcorn extravaganza; while the ending does leave hope for a follow-up should the box office warrant it, I personally cast my vote for dragons to be left extinct.<br />From the film's beginning, Quinn (later played, as an adult, by Christian Bale) is linked to the rebirth of the dragons, whom the audience is told in a relatively long and cumbersome narrative are responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs.  They've stayed dormant for hundreds of years, waiting for the chance to rise again and feast on a new munchie ... mankind.<br />Hoping to survive the ensuing cataclysm, Quinn and company hightail it to the English outskirts, living in a commune responsible primarily for taking care of the children in hopes that a subsequent generation will find the answers for mankind's future.  Into their midsts comes Van Zan (played with cigar-chomping aplomb by a beefed-up Matthew McConaughey), a gung-ho American soldier bent on destroying dragons everywhere.  Van Zan and Quinn's ways clash, but pretty soon they find themselves on the same page, heading into a destroyed London to wipe out the dragon male, seemingly the source of all other dragons (don't ask).<br />I've always enjoyed post-apocalyptic movie fare.  From the MAD MAX series to the indie HARDWARE to even WATERWORLD, there's something to be said for mankind being removed from all of the technology and left with only its most primal instinct -- survival of the fittest.  While REIGN does explore a simple narrative, the film feels much like something we've seen before.<br />Perhaps the film's finest moment is all too short: Quinn and a fellow re-enact an unforgettable lightsaber duel with painted broomsticks while the wide-eyed urchins of tomorrow sit on and watch with wonderment and awe.<br />In many respects, I found the special effects, particularly those surrounding the dragons in flight, to appear almost cartoonish in nature and low quality.  While I don't want to spoil the climax for those viewers who are holding out for a future screening, I will divulge that Van Zan meets a demise befitting the limited character traits (think token military characters made famous by Lee Van Cleef or even stock vengeful types made infamous by Charles Bronson) he's provided.<br />It's all done by-the-book here, and, sadly, not very interesting.  What could've been JURASSIC PARK BY AIR instead becomes CARNOSAUR ON ASH, two steps up from a disappointment but one step shy of any true resonance..<br />Perhaps the film's finest moment is all too short: Quinn and a fellow re-enact an unforgettable lightsaber duel with painted broomsticks while the wide-eyed urchins of tomorrow sit on and watch with wonderment and awe.<br />In many respects, I found the special effects, particularly those surrounding the dragons in flight, to appear almost cartoonish in nature and low quality.

B000067CPX|5.0|This album is lyrically and musically beautiful. To tell the truth when I first listened to it I was extremely disappointed and angry. I was expecting songs more like the &quot;Californication&quot; cuts. After listening to each song more closely I realized how amazing they each are. Also, the mixing and producing on this album is perfect and the songs are flawless. Some of these songs almost compare to The Beatles, just listen to 'Tear', probably my favorite song. Other favorites are 'Can't Stop', 'Dosed', 'On Mercury', 'Throw Away Your Television', 'Minor Thing', 'Venice Queen', and 'By The Way'. The only songs I dislike are 'The Zephyr Song', 'Universally Speaking', and 'Warm Tape'. All of the other songs are amazing. The songs on this album are also mostly positive, which is rare in music today. They are also very emotional and some songs can almost make you cry...think 'Tear' again. I REALLY hope you take my advice and buy this album, because something like this extremely rare in new music today.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Oh, you don't need a review, do you?<br />It's the HOLY GRAIL, for Pete's sake!<br />The extras are great, too, so make sure you get the special edition.  My favorite bit is the Knights of Camelot dance, complete with lyrics at the bottom of the screen so you can finally learn the words!  Amaze your friends!  <br />Definitely worth buying the DVD, even if you have the movie on tape already.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I just rented Gosford Park looking for a &quot;character movie&quot; (something like &quot;State and Main&quot; or &quot;Best in Show&quot;).  Unfortunately, Gosford Park doesn't deliver in this category, or any category for that matter.  I'll spare the plot summaries (you can read that in other reviews) and cut to the pros and cons.<br />Pros:<BR>- The acting is quite good.  The main characters did a great job portraying both high society and life as the servants.<br />- To complement the acting, the sets and costumes are terrific.  The old mansion and surrounding areas are represented well, leaving the viewer feeling very immersed in the 1930's era.<br />Cons:<BR>- The story really drags most of the time.  There are a lot of characters, and the movie take time to try and build up a motive for each one.  However, this results in a lot of slow, uninteresting moments.  Additionally, I felt that too many characters were focused on.  The end result is confusion, and I spent a lot of time trying to tell characters apart.  This is not good, as I think we, as viewers, were supposed be intrigued by the possible suspects and be startled by the ending (obviously didn't happen for me).<br />- The character development wasn't helped at all by the awful sound.  As mentioned in other reviews, it is VERY hard to hear what the characters are saying.  Although I like the *idea* of the viewer sort of drifting from conversation to conversation, it was not well executed in this movie.  Instead I spent most of the time trying to make out anything intelligible from the jumble of phrases being thrown at our ears.<br />There are plenty of other things I could drivel about, but I think (a) a boring, slow plot and (b) unintelligible voices should be enough to convey my general disliking of the movie.<br />We didn't play with the DVD itself much itself.  The previews included on the DVD were very old (I don't remember the specific movies), but I don't care much for previews, so that didn't bother me.  One odd thing occurred when we first tried &quot;Play Movie.&quot;  The movie started, but without sound.  We had to use the scene selector and go to the first scene to get any sound (although I'm sure this is only a problem because we had a rental DVD).<br />The bottom line: I really can't think of any reason to see this movie, let alone own the DVD.  The plot is slow and the characters indistinguishable.
0875428940|5.0|Beautifully illustrated deck, I really like rich pagan symbolism found in the artwork.<br />It's also similar enough to the &quot;standard&quot; Rider-Waite deck that most people are familiar with, so it is easy to learn if you already know Rider-Waite.  If you don't read cards yet, that similarity will also be handy when ready any standard &quot;how to&quot; tarot book.
B00005JLDW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie which is a sleeper hit to me,<BR>there were some really good action scenes such as the skydiving<BR>paratroopers against the airborne dragon was really [cool].<BR>Matthew McConauhey looked really good in his \\"stone cold Steve Austin\\" shaved head with the \\"stone cold\\" attitude to boot.<BR>This movie should please all action movie fans and sci-fi fans to boot. Go see it and enjoy the cold desolate bleakness of the English scenery and the hopelessness of the survivors  battling these reptilian monsters. I hope the dvd version has extra footage added to it as this movie had so much untapped <BR>potential.
B000068QY7|4.0|Let's cut to the chase:<BR>Heathen Chemistry is really quite a good CD overall. Only one dog of a track (you'll know it when you hear it), some very nice material from Liam this time, and God help me, my favorite one on the album is a downright GREAT SONG from him called Better Man. <BR>This album sees Oasis transiting from Noel's back-up to more of a cohesive BAND posture. Noel's stuff is typical Noel, and I'm really not seeing a lot of growth here, solid but thin at the same time, the description could be Noel himself just as easily. He looks very thin and very tired.<BR> Liam, however, should have his lazy arse kicked for lolling around and leaving all the writing to Noel when he obviously crafts a wicked tune himself. Stepping up with some new songs of his own, Liam actually delivers, and I really like the dynamic of Liam singing his stuff and a bit of others', while Noel handles his own. A great arrangement, or at least one that shows promise.<BR>No new invention, just good, solid Oasis stuff performed by one of the tightest groups in the biz.<BR>Pick it up, it's good. On par with Rubber Soul on the Beatle Musical Development Scale, or the B.M.D.S. for short! Looking forward to their Revolver if they'd ever get to it.
B000002IQW|1.0|THis was there 2nd ablum and they shouldn't have made it. It got to close to speed metal. I didn't want fast music I wanted heavy metal.
B000067CPX|5.0|Others have already given you the vital facts, so mostly I'm only echoing.  This is the tightest, yet most-relaxed, sounding album the Chilis have ever done.  In fact, contradictions like that one abound here.  By The Way is experimental, going off in all sorts of intriguing directions (Latin guitar, Beach Boys-ish harmonies, Missing Persons-ish synths, Mexi-Cali barrio beats), but it all sounds natural, not forced.  Most of the album doesn't sound much like the Chilis punk roots, but then the punk spirit isn't about sounding like some guys sounded 35 years ago, it's about doing what no one expects and doing it balls out, so in many ways, this is their most punk album. The title, By The Way, sounds casual like an afterthought, yet even the most laid-back tracks on this album have an urgency that belies their seeming laziness.  On the surface, the lyrics seem to be more meaningless than ever, but those words stick in your head and you find meaning in the nonsense when your humming it to yourself later.  It doesn't matter when you discovered these guys, whether you go way back to the mid-80s like I do, or if 1999's Californication was your introduction, or if you've never owned a Chilis album.  This album is already going on my list of 25 CDs that I would rescue if my house was on fire.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is the follow up album to the Cronic. Dre has alwase been a pioneer of new beats and nasty lyrics. He also signs good under ground artists an brings them to some spot light  (the Licks, mel Man, Xzibit, Eminem) This has lots of nasty tracks with diffrent artists flowin wit hthe Doc, so if you like rap you gotta love beats by the ground breaker for the LBC, Dre ... the only thing this Cd could use more of is Snoop. On the original Cronic Snoop was on almost every track ... I think he is on 3 or 4 tracks of this Cd
0441172717|5.0|Many will find Dune dull, hard to read, pretentious etc.  The book is however one of the greatest novels ever made.  It is not a light read.  It is not meant to taken lightly.  An understanding of the author, his intentions and the overall messianical pattern that is interwoven in the novel is truely needed to comprehend the book.<br />Readers of the book often focus soley on the plot line of the novel.  Though they may think it simplistic and predictable, it is not.  Though Dune can be read without having to read the other novels they truely should be read together.  They work together and create a larger storyline.  When I first finished reading Dune I had the distinct feeling of missing something, or that the novel was not really finished.  It wasn't.  The other Dune books contribute to build an understanding of the underlying motives of the books characters and orginazations.<br />The book does at time seem simplistic due to the somewhat static characters.  Many are archetypal, however I would bring your attention to Dr. Yueh.  He was not just a simple traitor.  He loved house Atriedes but he hated the Harkonnens even more so that he would betray the Atreides.  He is not just a simple traitor acting for his own greed or vice.  Stilgar as well is a dynamic character.  He goes from a great leader to a worshiper of Muad'Dib.  I find that a reduction of his character.  Paul himself goes from a rather mouthy boy to a leader of the imperium.  Anyone can seee how Paul is a very multidimensional character.  He is Paul Atriedes, Duke of Arrakis.  He is Usul, the lover of his Fremen concubine Chani.  He is the religious icon Muad'Dib leader of the Fremen and the new order of the Universe.  There are of course the single dimensional characters who are unchanging who function as a sounding board for the more dynamic charcters.  Gurney Halleck is one.  An idealist who serves as a control from which one can measure the change in Paul.  He also represents the concepts of idealism.<br />Ultimatly this book is not to be simply glanced over.  It should be read more then once to gain a true appreciation.  It is not a simple story but almost an exposition on concepts of destiny, agency, and struggle.  If all of those things are taken into account and carfully pondered over then the true beauty of the book can be seen.<br />Some complain that upon detailed scrutiny of the novel that the book falls apart.  Not so.  Everything is accounted for.  Sometimes the premises for those reasons are all of one sentence and can be easily missed.  Read carefully.<br />The book is also full of underlying patterns.  Compare the novel to the Greek Tragedy of Agemenon and his house from who the Atriedes descend.  One can see the repitition of that storyline with a twist.  All the biblical, and religious references.  The book is full of such allusions.<br />This edition has some typos, font changes, repeated lines, extra spaces.  It was not proof read well if at all.  The publishers should really do a better job.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie was not as good as the book ... but yet this movie was prefectly done. If you enjoy this movie read the book it is a mind opening experiance. Fight Club over all is an eye opening experiance. Calling it a movie is an understatment. It's messages teach people that in this world where we are only told to consume and buy that rejecting that philosophy leads to true enlightenment so Recycle your Pets and Fertalise you lawn with motor oil

B000063UR2|3.0|LEGEND was somewhat of a good movie but the DVD was better than the movie. The movie is way too slow and too long. I'm not a big fan of Ridley Scott [except HANNIBAL]. I hate it when big time stars do admit to their early work. In this case Tom Cruise didn't bother doing a commentary track or he wasn't in the featurette. I have nothing agianst Tom Cruise [he is one of my favorite actors]. I did like the music video for \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" by Brian Ferry [Roxy Music, the coolest part in the video is when David Glimour [Pink Floyd} does his guitar solo. Overall the movie should been like a hour short.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This was the best movie I ever saw!  It was beautiful, enticing, uplifting, and sad.  I won't bore you by saying what the movie is about because others have done it for me.  Nicole Kidman was gorgeous and sang beautifully.  Ewan was awesome and he too sang beautifully!  They couldn't have chosen anyone better for the part of Christian (I'm a bit biased because I adore Ewan McGregor).  <BR>   The costumes were spectacular, spectacular!  My compliments to the designers.  <BR>   John Leguizamo did an awesome job as Toulouse.  It certainly gave me a laugh to see Johnny Legs with barely any legs at all!  I love his accent too.  <BR>   My favorite director is now Baz Luhrmann.  He is truly the visionary director of the 21st century and that Academy Award should've gone to him.  He tells stories not in just plain words but through dance (Strictly Ballroom), the language of Shakespeare (Romeo+Juliet), and music (Moulin Rouge). <BR>   The other actors were awesome too.  Jim Broadbent as Zidler was miraculous, Richard Roxburgh did a fine job playing the ruthless Duke, Jacek Koman (the Argentinean), Garry MacDonald (the Doctor), and Matthew Whittet (Satie), along with John Leguizamo were amusing and dazzling as the Bohemians!  <BR>   I close with the promise to uphold the Bohemian ideals of Truth, Beauty, Freedom, but above all things, LOVE!!!!  <BR>  \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return...\\"<BR>-Ewan McGregor as Christian in \\"Moulin Rouge\\"
006019250X|5.0|This is the only book I have read for 3 times (I hope I'll read it more), and with every next time I discovered something new.. and with every next time it takes me longer to read it! <BR>One thing that excites me a lot, are those little but very impressive phrases that makes You think about life, the meaning of it, and about yourself. Following Your dream has never been an easy goal, but only with great courage and will You can achieve it. And during this way You start to recognize the meaning of the things and people You love.<BR>This book helped me to realize who am I, who are those people I really love, but to whom I have never told that, and of course - what is my dream. I don't say, that I will follow my dream as the main hero of the book did, but one is for sure - I'll look to this dream with more different and serious view!<BR>I really suggest everybody to read this book and discover that  the dream could lead You through the life no matter either You achieve Your goal or not!
B00005O5CM|4.0|Don't let the previews fool you, this is a really good and smart movie! It's about a girl who goes to Harvard Law to impress her boyfriend, who in the end turns out to be a jerk and she meets a much nicer guy and ends up with him. <BR>When I first saw this movie, I'll admit I thought it was just another one of those teen movie that seems to be popping up everywhere now, but I was wrong, this is a movie the whole family can enjoy. I would give it five stars, but I DIDN'T like the whole soriorty girls stereotype this movie had. If someone watchs this movie they will think that all sorioryy girls are giggly, shallow airheads, that are into their apperances like Elle's soriorty sisters were. Being in a soriorty right now, I couldn't help but feel insulted. But, other then that this movie is really good and I highly recommmend it! You won't be disappointed!

B00003CXI1|5.0|Well, I have to admit that I didn't understand the whole Harry Potter craziness when it began but I decided to watch the movie to really see what the big deal was about. The movie's special effects help draw the watcher into the Hogwarts School and also Harry's home and really begin to understand the magic behind the mystery. Every piece of the movie was very imaginative and creative to help draw in the people like myself....that just didn't get it. And now I have bought the movie and watch it all of the time. Many movies just don't go to the extent that this movie went into. And with the many unique characters help inhance the movie to bring in both children and adults to this magical world. I just can't wait for the next movie and I also am waiting the series to show up so I can read the series. This is truly a Wizard of Oz for our time (like they said on the commericals) that will be charished for many years to come. This is one you have to have in your DVD collection
B00005JL3A|3.0|My friends and I got passes to \\"Resident Evil\\" on opening night.  None of us were expecting very much, and we got even less.  We only went for Milla Jovovich, and in that respect we got an eyeful (literally...keep your eyes peeled in the end for a brief but well-worth-the-wait shot of nudity).  The movie's got bad editing, terrible dialogue, an awful soundtrack and a storyline that makes even less sense than that of \\"The City Of Lost Children\\".  It was a good film to hoot at the screen for (and hoot we did), so I would imagine that it would make a perfect midnight selection for a party. However, if you're even tempted to rent it to watch with your buds, I would recommend something truly campy like \\"Death Race:  2000\\" instead.  Hopefully I haven't upset anyone who seriously enjoyed this flick, but rather than lay the DVD in a place of honor, you'd be better off putting your twenty bucks toward the next \\"Resident Evil\\" game.
B000002LQR|4.0|It's hard to believe that this album was created in 1991 when it hasn't lost it's edge over 11 years. This is by far the best Chili Peppers CD. It contains Give It Away, Breaking the Girl, and Under the Bridge (which is the Chili Peppers' biggest hit.) It also has nastier lyrics than the previous ones. Check it out.
6305320802|4.0|My friends who don't &quot;get&quot; musicals often lament about the breaking into song at the drop of a hat thing.  I love it.  Music so often expresses how I feel better than I could just say with words.  <br />One detriment about many movie musicals is that often the actors aren't primarily singers.  That's what I love about Shirley Jones and Julie Andrews movies - they are really fantastic singers.  <br />Gordon MacRae was also tremendous.  He and Shirley made a beautiful couple.<br />Rod Steiger was nominated for his role in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; in 1955, but he also deserved it for his menacing Jud Fry.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|There are many Disney movies that are claimed to be masterpieces, and I'm sure they all have a worthy stature to be referred to by that position.  However, Beauty and the Beast is the top billing amongst all of Disney's masterpieces.<BR>This movie was incredible not only in the way that it captured a classic love story known throughout all ages and presented it in a way that appeals to the masses, but it also combined incredible animation techniques of simple pencil animation and state-of-the-art computer animation (which is shown in the infamous ballroom scene).<BR>I feel that this film opened many doors in animation with the animation, the presentation of the story, and the music that moves and supplements the picture.  <BR>Besides, the fact that this was the first animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar just goes to show that this is truly a beauty of a masterpiece.

That's what I love about Shirley Jones and Julie Andrews movies - they are really fantastic singers.  And who could resist a young Ronny Howard singing &quot;Gary, Indiana&quot; and &quot;Wells Fargo Wagon&quot;?<br />The introduction by Shirley Jones was a plus.  I didn't access the &quot;making of&quot; feature, but the digital remastering was great.  (I can never watch the foot bridge scene without thinking about the story behind the surprised look on Robert Preston's face when the baby Shirley Jones was carrying at the time kicked while they were embracing!)
B00006690G|4.0|\\"The Eminem Show\\" lacks the powerful single \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" had with \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". \\"Without Me\\" is supposed to be that single but the chorus isn't catchy enough.<br />Song ratings of this album:<br />White America - 8/10 - Eminem shouting \\"White America!\\" is very catchy. Very good song.<br />Business - 7/10 - The beat is great in this song, but it gets a lower score because of the loud beaths Em takes toward the end of the last verse.<br />Cleanin' Out My Closet - 8/10 - Great song, the first single for his movie \\"8 Mile\\".<br />Square Dance - 7/10 - Eminem with his southern accent in the chorus is catchy but can get annoying.<br />Soldier - 6/10 - Eminem raps his fastest here but the \\"I'm a soldier...\\" chorus doesn't get me hooked in like some of his other ones.<br />Say Goodbye To Hollywood - 5/10 - Half the song is the chorus. On the last verse he is off on the beat and ends up overlapping his rap into the chorus.<br />Drips - 9/10 - Nice touch with Obie Trice but Trice could have been better if he stopped describing his orgasm and rapped some better rhymes. Eminem's verse is great, as is the chorus.<br />Without Me - 8/10 - This song is the last album's \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" only not as good.<br />Sing For The Moment - 8/10 - This is song the last album's \\"Stan\\". Nice touch with the Aerosmith chorus and the solo guitarist at the end. It's not as deep as \\"Stan\\" but has the same feeling.<br />Superman - 8/10 - Love the chorus.<br />Hailie's Song - 6/10 - Eminem shows why he is a better rapper than he is a singer in this song.<br />When The Music Stops - 7/10 - Lacks a chorus but it is more fun to listen to his D-12 friends rap than Em himself.<br />Say What You Say - 7/10 - The rapping is just way too slow to be a hit.<br />Till I Collapse - 6/10 - Nate Dogg is great in this song, but the beat is just way too simple. It is practically Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\" beat with the boom, boom, clap beat.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - 4/10 - Hailie Jade isso annoying its not even funny. This song should have been left off the album. Em's rhymes are pretty good but its his daughter's voice that is just ear burning.<br />Download \\"The Way I Am\\", Eminem's greatest song ever.<br />Pick this up. Nice bass to go along with your system.
B000066NW0|5.0|this is a brilliant album!i agree that anybody who wants that 'punk' style she claims to have will be a little dissapointed.However,you will struggle to find a bad song.Songs such as thing's I'll never say, my world and I'm with you are really great songs.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Well, after making a splash as an ivory man-hating R&B tart of \\"There You Go\\" and \\"Most Girls\\", P!nk makes a suprise move into rock/blues tinged pop. Normally such an inexperienced artist wouldn't be given such freedom, but she has it, and has produced a killer sophmore set that blows the previous album out of the water (which is really saying something, in my opinion). So far the record has produced three strong singles in the party anthem \\"Get The Party Started\\", the self destructive \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", and the rocky metaphorical \\"Just Like A Pill\\". The latter is one of the albums strongest tracks, with a rocking sing-a-long chorus. Definitely my favorite P!nk song. Other songs have a strong bluesy vibe, especially the Steven Tyler collabo \\"Misery\\" and \\"Eventually\\". Personal songs and tunes about family struggle show a fresh side of P!nk, the best of these being \\"My Vietnam\\" and \\"Missundaztood\\". This is a great album, and it really makes look forward to what she has in store for the future.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Well it is a pretty good movie. I like the special effects and i think it has a good plot that doesnt really cram it all in at the end. It just lets it go. I love watching it in dts.
B000063V8R|4.0|Until the release of TNG on DVD, I was a stubborn original series faithful.  Wow, what I have missed! I purchased the first season DVD upon it's release hoping to become a TNG fan and I became hooked immediately.  I am very pleased with TNG's arrival on DVD.  When the series first aired, I had trouble tuning in due to a busy schedule of classes among other things.  Now that the series has been released on DVD, I can watch the episodes sequentially and at my leisure. And it looks and sounds outstanding!  Thanks to Star Trek and Paramount!  <br />Being fairly new to the TNG universe, many may disagree with my opinions of the third season. I give year 3 of TNG four out of five stars.  Season 3 winners are as follows:<br />1.  Best of Both Worlds Part 1:  This episode is believed by many to be the best episode ever.  City on the Edge of Forever from the original series comes in at a close second.<BR>2.  Yesterday's Enterprise:  Excellent plot and story, great special effects.  A temporal rift sends the Enterprise-C 22 years into the future.  Picard and crew must send the ship back to the past to avoid war against the Klingon Empire.  I almost like it better than Best of Both Worlds.<BR>3.  The Offspring:  Jonathan Frakes' directorial debut is a hit. Data constructs an android child, who attempts to adjust to life on board the Enterprise.<BR>4.  The Defector: An excellent adventure about a Romulan officer who comes to the Enterprise with vital news about a potential Romulan attack on Federation outposts near the neutral zone. The defector's questionable past creates a credibility issue. <BR>5.  The Bonding:  So many episodes could have been tied for fifth best.  TNG tackles the issue of death and letting go.<BR>6.  The Enemy: On a ravaged planet, La Forge teams up with a Romulan to save themselves from certain death.<BR>7.  Sins of the Father:  Picard and Worf challenge accusations that Worf's father was a traitor, aligning himself with the Romulans. <BR>Other big winners:  The Ensigns of Command, The Survivors, Who Watches the Watchers, Booby Trap, Deja Q, Sarek, The Price, Transfigurations, The Vengeance Factor, Tin Man.<BR>[Not as good]:  Evolution, A Matter of Perspective, Hollow Pursuits, The Most Toys, Menage a Troi.  <br />This season is huge because we get to know the characters on a more personal level than we did in the first two seasons. The extras in the box set itself were satisfying to me, but if I were as familiar with TNG as I am the original series, I probably would find it lacking. However, the CD-ROMs that have been packaged with the DVDs as a bonus are a nice extra (episode guide with season 1, enterprise interactive technical manual with season 2, and two MP-3 audio books with season 3).  I have noticed that many stores have the CD-ROMs but you will pay ... more.  The picture and sound are fabulous.  It's tough watching the episodes on TNN even with DSS. I'm glad TNG is kicking it in syndication, and I continue to tune in.  However, the DVD experience is unmatched.<BR>Gene Roddenberry was right when he said Star Trek would take off in season 4, but I don't think the writers, producers, directors, and actors had any idea during the course of season 3 that this would turn out to be the best season of TNG.  From what I have read, there is quite a debate as to which season is the best, season three vs. four.  I can't wait until early September to find out for myself!
0783222955|5.0|A picture can say a thousand words so can a movie. This movie is wonderful! The plot is expressed beautiful. It tells a very powerful story. Saying that racism and hatred holds us back but love brings us together. Buy this movie to have your kids learn something! Tom's story is one that needs to be shared and learned from. Harper Lee is an amazing writer and her book will never be forgotten. Nor will this movie!
B000066AXC|5.0|\\"Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life-the life which has the seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it-can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing, soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances.\\"<br />-George Eliot<br /><br />In September, 1947, mathematical genius John Nash spends his time attempting to distinguish himself with a completely original idea at Princeton University in lieu of attending classes. He distances himself from the other students with his introverted and eccentric behavior and admits he doesn't really like people. He is so consumed with thought, he neglects his most basic needs and becomes so absorbed in his own serene thought processes he forgets to eat and sleep.<br /><br />In fact, no one can really relate to him until he meets a beautiful student who attends one of his classes. Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) seems to have the patience to work through situations in real life, that Nash doesn't have time for or is not concerned with. His mind won't let him deal with real life and he is tossed into an unrealistic fantasy by delusions that seek to destroy him. Alicia falls for his mind, they marry and her emotional IQ is so high that she truly shows her husband unconditional love.<br /><br />He enters an imaginary life in which he helps the government break codes in magazines. His wife becomes increasingly aware of his mental condition and tries to help him see what reality truly is. She needs to believe that something extraordinary is feasible. She believes he can conquer anything. The problem is, he is suffering from a mental illness which is seeking to destroy his world.<br /><br />As he descends into a world of his own making, schizophrenia takes over and he has to take medications that interfere with his ability to \\"do his job.\\" This causes him immense grief and he lacks purpose. His job actually turns out to be completely of his own imagination. This espionage part of the story is absorbing and exciting. The emotional elements are highly rewarding and the actual love story was for me at least, overwhelmingly beautiful.<br /><br />Through John Nash's life he learns what is truly important and in that is the true beauty of this story. Ron Howard shows genius in his ability to so capture your heart with his directing.<br /><br /> A Beautiful Mind will draw from you those exquisite emotions only a story of great depth and sensitivity can. The characters are genuinely persuasive and screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman crafted one of the most intelligent scripts to date. An exceptional score reflects a complex backdrop of emotions and in this mirror of music the rays of reflection will touch your soul.<br /><br />A Beautiful Mind is an eloquent portrayal of John Nash's life with an emphasis on the emotional torment mental illness can evoke contrast with the sheer beauty of love.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />~The Rebecca ReviewThe emotional elements are highly rewarding and the actual love story was for me at least, overwhelmingly beautiful.

B00002MZ2T|5.0|Aussie duo have done it again. They have won my heart with their &quot;up&quot; songs. Affirmation is a really great track that adds a little bit of an insight to life and the way to go about living it. Songs like I Knew I Loved You and Hold Me are a bonus to this album. Simple and pure they provide a simple moment in life where the flowers of romance blooms. On the other hand tracks like The Animal Song is more of a positive and a huge song for those who need to take a break from the hectic days of life. Darren and Daniel, you are truly song birds.......
B000067IZ3|5.0|I like Steven Soderbergh. He is a genius. He directed another good film called 'Ocean's Eleven'. I just love his movies. I'm glad he won best director for this at the Academy Awards. He most likely deserved it. Sadly, he didn't win for best picture. But hopefully, he'll make another classic. It's (most) likely he'll make another brilliant film. Like 'Ocean's 12' or 'Higher Traffic'. It would be so brilliant. I would be much pleased if he made another brilliant, superb film. I hope to see more from brilliant directors like him. And about the DVD...it is great. It has great picture quality, and great sound. It's pretty funny with the German (Or Russian, not sure) trailer. I just laughed so much. But the movie was so intellectual. So...compassionate. Lots of Drama and intensity. Michael Douglas was superb as the Drug Czar. And Erika Christensen is great as Caroline. She is very dedicated to her role and very good at it. Many people are good in their roles as people against drugs and trying to get rid of it, or showing that they like drugs and that they get in trouble for it. So if you want to see this, go see it. But if you don't, go your own way. In my terms, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005JLDW|3.0|This was an enjoyable, well written movie with solid acting and special effects.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its full potential.  At an hour and a half (or so), it left me wanting more.  I could easily have enjoyed it at twice the length.  The major problem I had with the film was the fact that, once they discover the first dragon, the movie leaps forward twenty years.  It was that intervening twenty years that I wanted to see more of.  It would have been interesting to see all of humanity come together in a common cause of survival (a la Armageddon).  It would even have been intriguing to get a glimpes of the political maneuvering that occurred, as well.  Unfortunately, all we get of these intervening years is an interior monologue from Christian Bale's character as he writes in his journal.  In addition, the ending, to me, seemed a bit abrupt.  I was expecting some sort of brief summary of the events that took place after the movie involving humanity's continued struggle against the beasts.<br />Despite these shortcomings, the movie was enjoyable in and of itself.  Well written dialogue and intriguing characters held my attention during the lulls in between the action scenes.  Bale and McConaughey stood out among the cast in both their acting and in the definition of the characters themselves.  The post apocalyptic scenario was handled well and was believable.  The struggle to feed survivors and the worry that other enclaves were gone and the fear of marauders gave a feel of authenticity.  The costumes and sets were well done and added vividly to the vision of the creators.  Finally, I have to say that these are some of the best looking dragons on film.  I was highly disappointed in Dragonheart's design...a little to cheesy for me.  These, though, were menacing and frightening.  I just wish we'd gotten to see more (again, the hour and a half playing time comes into play here...there wasn't enough time to develop characters and story as well as mix in moreaction than there already was...oh well).<br />If you're a fantasy fan, then I would recommend you see this in the theaters, just for the chance to view the creatures on the big screen. Otherwise, you may just want to wait for it to be released on DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|'Complicated' was a great choice 4 a debut single! It rocks! Da album rocks! Avril all da way!!!!! Sk8er Boi iz a great song! I think Avril iz gonna b a wicked new artist n will have a great future!!
B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Anything but Ordinary.&quot; A title of one of Avril Lavigne's songs, but also the theme for her life. A singer/songwriter/guitarist, Avril joins the wave of 'new music' along other artist such as Michelle Branch, John Mayer, and Alicia Keys, where the artist really is just that. On her debut 14 track CD, Avril writes or co-writes all of her songs in a mix of punk/rock/pop that beautifully works together to produce her own unique blend. Each one of Avril's songs is written with honesty and a point of view that anyone can relate to. In &quot;I'm with You&quot;, Avril sings about feeling hopelessly alone, but ready for someone to join her heart. &quot;Naked&quot; is about feeling free around someone. A great voice, but most importantly, fantastic lyrics!  <br />Though &quot;Complicated&quot; is a big hit on the radio, one listen to this CD will let you know that Avril is no one hit wonder.
B00005R2M3|5.0|A great start 4 a new language! Her debut single from dis album was SUPER. It sounded great n da radio stations n t.v. music channels juss kept on playin 'Whenever Wherever' coz tons of ppl LUVED it!! Her second single 'Underneath Your Clothes' was a ballad. Diff from da up beat debut single but juss as good! Same wit 'Underneath Your Clothes' Channels n radio stations kept on playin it over n over! It was amazing!!

B000002U94|3.0|This was Bob's second live album, and as is the case with most sequels, this one isn't quite as good as the first one. At the time of it's release, I was a DJ for a rock station, and remember the mornin' that &quot;Tryin' To Live My Life Without You&quot; came in as a single, (45 RPM record). Everyone in the station went nuts over it, and we all watched the mail daily for the album.<br />And we were kind of let down when it finally arrived. The opening/title cut rocked much better than the studio version, (which had been released on the infamous &quot;Urban Soundboy Cowtrack&quot; as we called it), and segued right into the single we'd already been playing.<br />After that, the album served as a sort of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; at that time. For the most part though, I prefer the studio versions. The notable exception here is &quot;Old Time Rock And Roll,&quot; which puts the much over-played studio version to shame. Featuring a :45 second rockin' guitar intro, as opposed to the short piano intro on the studio version, THIS is how the tune SHOULD sound!<br />In summation, if you have the studio versions of the hits, and the first &quot;Live Bullet&quot; album, you don't really need this one...EXCEPT that, no Seger collection is complete without this version of &quot;OTR&amp;R&quot;...Worth buying for that song and the first 2 on the album alone.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Well, Altman is one of my favorite directors.  I've enjoyed the big hits(Mash, The Player, Nashville) as well as the little ones (Streamers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, 3 Women).  When I saw all the praise I was expecting an excellent film, this isn't it.  <BR>First of all, there's the dreaded patented Altman sound mix that has worked well elsewhere (especially in Mash where it accentuated the sense of chaos), that is a disaster here.  Trying to make out what these folks are saying just gets in the way of enjoying and understanding the film.  The movie is overly long, it takes too long to get to the murder, I didn't care about the guy who died, and I didn't get that longing to figure out who killed him (this kills the who-done-it).  The interwoven character studies that works so well in Nashville and Short-cuts doesn't work here as it simply meant there were more characters I really didn't care about.  Beautifully filmed? yes!  That's the only reason I can even give it 3 stars.  I had heard how this film takes you beneath the surface of intricate relationships between characters (something Altman can do quite well).  Ok, this person is sleeping with this person, and that guy doesn't love his wife, and this lady really runs the show, etc.,...  The problem is the film builds no real feelings for any of them.    Very disappointing.
B000068QY7|4.0|I've only had this album for a few days, but I've listened to it a good number of times already. Let's be up front here: if you're a mad-fer-it in the wool Oasis fan, you've already decided to buy this. So, for those still wondering, I do recommend picking this one up. Does it sound familiar? Why, yes it does. Does it sound good then? You betcha. Does it rock? Like a beast. But would someone please name one rock band in the last forty years who has *not* had some Beatles influences? <br />I'll agree that the first half of the album is stronger. Liam's voice sounds great. I'm pleased to hear Gem Archer and Andy Bell contributing to Oasis, versus Gem and Andy playing Noel's parts circa SOTSOG. Are they a better band for it? Well, they're a different band, and this album does show that. There still are ballads and hefty guitar anthems. That's the Oasis formula and until they get richer doing something else, that's the way it will always be. More power to them.<br />Like everyone else, I'll say that Liam's songwriting is a huge surprise. My jaw dropped when I heard \\"Songbird\\" for the first time as I never thought a song like that would make it to an Oasis album. \\"Force of Nature\\" is all right. Makes me think of a Paul McCartney vocal circa \\"White Album.\\" The rest of what Noel has come up with is pretty good, but he sounds a little knackered. Maybe it's getting off the drugs or personal stuff that's left him weary, but you almost want to tell him to go have a break, we'll still be here when he gets back. <br />And that sums up the Oasis/audience interaction. They never make albums to convert people; they make the albums they want to and play what they want to, and that's why we love them. If you didn't like it then, odds are you won't like it now. I think they're showing some maturity and a willingness to step into new directions though, and if what they do from here sounds as good, they're in great shape.
B00003CXI1|1.0|...I felt I had to balance out all the 5 star ratings. I admit the movie has some appeal because of the charming concept as well as the atmosphere established by the sets and the score.  However, the movie pretty much fails in most other aspects. None of the jokes are funny. The editing and camera-work seem choppy and the delivery of the plot is often corny. Many scenes are overdone, especially the quiditch scenes. Worst of all, Harry seemed to me a totally unsympathetic character. He smiled at all the wrong moments and generally uninspired.
B0000640VO|5.0|This was a film that was pleasantly painful to see.  Confused?  After two hours of grinning my cheeks were crying for mercy.  Amelie, however, did not give it to them.  It's a movie that as soon as you see it, you know you want to own it.
0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan has written a winner.  His characters are well-developed, and his story is entertaining.  It would be difficult to beat this book.  I'm glad I read it, and I'm thrilled to recommend it to others.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Umm, yeah. I was forced to endure this dog of a movie for over 2 excruciating hours and the best thing i can recall is the cameo with Billy Ray Cyrus (if that tells you anything). Whatever schmuck nominated David Lynch as a movie making genius should just stay away from normal humans. Apparently I'm not intelligent enough to grasp all of the deep, hidden film noir-esque hints, clues, whatever else. I'd rather be subjected to brilliant classics like Dude, Where's My Car. Thankfully this pig didn't win any big awards. How do these movies get made? ...

B000063S6Z|5.0|I went to go see his concert last night, and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. People standing the entire time, and clapping and dancing. A lot of eye-candy, and so many additives to his live performance that it dwarfs his albums. There were approximently 9 people on stage... One DJ, 2 violinist, a chellist, a singer, bongo player, drummer, bassist, and of course moby. With addatives such as the violinists and more precusion... to the record scratching of an award winning DJ... this concert is wonderful. It's not just Moby that makes a Moby concert... It's the people he surrounds himself with.
0452279488|4.0|This is a very sweet book and a must-read for middle-aged women, especially if they are single.  I appreciate Helen's contrary nature and her seemingly self-destructive impulses.  I also appreciate her hesitation to take on her venerable family members. And I love the people who populate her bookstore (Johnny is quite believable).  My only complaint - and a very real one - is that this plot droops and drags in places.
B000067CPX|2.0|I was excited to hear a new album was on the way. Then the local clear channel affiliate started pumping out pre-release tracks and, I got less excited. I bought it anyway. What happened to the rythm section? A drum machine could have done the work. The vocals are nice, but without any rythm to pump the lyrics up, the album falls flat for me. I see people referring to Under The Bridge, but that song, while a ballad, had some fire to it. This entire album just noodles along with some clever phrases and angst. I'll pull it out again in a week or two and try it out again, but I think this album goes in the &quot;failed experiment&quot; pile.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is the reason movies are made.  It's an excellent film correctly portraying the life of a schizophrenic while still giving you the hollywood cinematography you'd expect.

1577658213|1.0|Dorian Gray is not a kid book by any stretch of the imagination.  No swordfights, no prince and princess, no happy ending.  Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression.  One of the main themes is homosexuality.  It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased.  It is scary.  It scared me .  Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book.  Colleges study this book in literature classes.  That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work.  Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids.  And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.  Save Dorian Gray for later.

Her grandaughter, Evelyn, needed to take out a child custody bond, per the terms of her divorce, and Mabel used her house as collateral.  Now Evelyn has disappeared with daughter, Annie, her ex, a Trenton low-life beholden to the mob, is making a lot of unpleasant noise, and the bondsman has given Mabel three weeks to produce Annie or forfeit her home.  Mabel needs help and figures that Stephanie, inept bounty hunter from hell, is just the person for the job.  She finds people.  She brings them in.  She can handle this missing person case.  Poor Steph's plate is already full, chasing down Trenton's not-so-finest who've missed their court dates and are on their way to jail.  In no time, she finds she's in way over her head when dangerous gangsters, who want her off this case and out of the way, start sending threatening messages in the form of bombs, snakes, and spiders.  But never fear, once tenacious Stephanie Plum takes on a job, she's like a dog with a bone, and she's not letting common sense, anyone or anything get in her way, until she brings in her woman.....  Janet Evanovich is back with another manic romp through Trenton, and as hilarious and entertaining as this series is, Hard Eight doesn't hit the mark.  This is a weak addition, with a flat story line that goes nowhere.  The whole gang is back, along with a couple of newcomers, and they're as quirky and wacky as ever.  The laughs are back too, but for the most part have all been done before, and the same old jokes are beginning to become tiresome.  How many cars can Stephanie lose, blow up, or wreck?  Why bother even locking her apartment door when any and everybody seems to be able to break in?  Can't she ever just simply put the cuffs on a &quot;client&quot; and bring him in without wrestling and rolling around on the ground, usually in mud, garbage, or dinner?  And how many funeral parlor incidents can Grandma Mazur have before she's banned from Stiva's?  But the saddest development in Hard Eight is the lack of sexual tension in the eternal Ranger-Morelli-Plum triangle.  The sparks aren't flying this time out, and there seems to be no fire left in that furnace.  This is a book that really doesn't stand alone, and if you're new to the series, you'll be lost if you begin here with number eight.  So go back to the start of it all, with One For The Money, and read them all.  For old and loyal fans, Hard Eight still has some flashes of fun that you don't want to miss, and let's face it, even a weak Stephanie Plum novel is better than no Stephanie Plum at all.
B000003TAW|5.0|I cannot even put into words why this album is superior to every other album ever recorded.  Nothing is even in the ballpark.  This album and Pinkerton are the reasons for Weezer's fanatical cult following.  In twenty years people will still be talking about and listening to this record.  Mark my words, years from now this album will be talked and raved about with the likes of Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Revolver.  If you don't already own it.  I give you my word that you will be immensely satisfied.

0780624890|4.0|Forget about slayers, Deacon Frost's character is enigmatic enough to make you want to BE a vampire. Dorff's portrayal of the antagonist is charismatic, intelligent, sexy and evil. What makes him truly evil is his thirst for power which pales even his thirst for blood. Ruthless yet beautiful, Frost is an unforgettable antagonist... ...<BR>THe history of how Blade comes to be half vampire/ half human, i thought was rather cheesy. And how contemporary vampire slayers have now become more of a buff, black leather wearing, ...kicking kung fu pro is a little bit of a turn off. True, that the image IS appealing in a sense that it's an idealistic Hollywood image that everyone loves, but does it have to be that stereotypical? Even their imperfections are perfectly portrayed... and almost expected.<BR>in any case, the film in general was good. i liked the comic-to-film adaptation like other films adapted from comics ie spawn<br />the house of erabus reminds me of Vampires: The Masquerade.
B00005MP58|5.0|I think it will be repetitive to say how wonderful this movie is, especially if you are a Jane Austen fan or a lover of classical stories and period movies. I was very surprised, however, to discover that this is the first movie I have ever seen that is true to the novel. In fact most of the dialogue in the movie are quoted word for word from the novel. Here's why - in some instances where I had difficulty understanding the dialogue because Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) mumbles a lot or speaks very softly, I took the book from my shelf and read the corresponding chapter. It was amazing, I ended up re-reading the novel as I viewed the movie as if having the manuscript in my hand. This is a beautiful adaptation and certainly a beautiful love story. Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet) truly deserved the BAFTA best actress award.

0446605409|2.0|\\"WICKED WIT...MIND-TWISTING SUSPENSE...A WINNER\\"  is what the front cover of PLUM ISLAND promised, quoting Newsday.  With the exception of the \\"wicked wit\\" element, the promise remained unfulfilled.  Not that Nelson DeMille isn't a competent writer; on the contrary, his easy style and descriptive prose make for lucid reading, but PLUM ISLAND - which may not be typical of his work - never succeeded in raising my adrenaline level once.  I thought I was buying a thriller, but this book probably falls more comfotably into the detective mystery genre. In any event, it proved to be a disappointment.  <br />The story is related in first person narrative by cavalier NYPD homicide detective John Corey.  But although Corey's sardonic, flippant humour (think Sam Spade out of Dave Barry) makes for easy reading,  sometimes even evoking a laugh-out-loud response from the reader, the story itself, and its lack of momentum disappoint.  After being shot and seriously injured on duty, Corey is convalescing at his uncle's house in a Long Island seaside hamlet, when the local sheriff presses him into service as a \\"consultant\\" to investigate the brutal murder of a married couple with whom they are both acquainted.  Only a couple of chapters into the book, the story founders, becoming bogged down in an unnecessarily lengthy and detailed exposition of the animal disease centre on Plum Island where the murder victims worked as research scientists.  This seems to set the pace for most of the remainder of the book; indeed, the first real action does not take place until more than 450 pages have been turned.  DeMille develops his characters well, and the quick-fire dialogue is amusing and frequently entertaining, but Detective Corey's highly speculative deductions, by which he ultimately solves the murders, are implausible.  I look forward to reading another, hopefully more suspenseful, offering by Nelson DeMille.  This one, for me at least, fell flat.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar was a very serious book about a young woman deciding to die with herself as the killer.  I must admit I usually don't read such heavy books... the storyline was a bit depressing and twisted but the book was written amazingly-- only Plath could turn a serious and depressing storyline into a wonderful read.

B000065U1N|3.0|I agree with the previous reviews that complement the way BHD depicts the chaos of war, and especially the camaraderie and dedication of the soldiers to their fellow Rangers, etc.<br />My one complaint is with the main characters. Except for Grimes, all were stereotypes. You have the two southern stereotypes - the God-fearing duty-driven Captain and Hoot, the bad-...no-nonsense fighter. There was no subtlety about either of these characters at all, but I guess Hollywood has always done that with southerners.<br />Ditto for Josh Hartnett's \\"nice guy who wants to save the world but finds himself in over his head\\" character. The only thing they left out was which town in California he was from.  <br />A well-made movie that could have benefited from better developed  characters.
B000065V9P|5.0|This review applies solely to the new, remastered version of &quot;US&quot;, and what an improvement it is! I have always liked the original &quot;US&quot; as I am a Peter Gabriel/Genesis fanatic of 25 years or so, but found the soundy somewhat muddy in spots. Well, that's all in the past, as this new version is much sharper, clearer and better seperated, especially in the high ranges. The title track and &quot;Digging In the Dirt&quot; benefit most obviously  from the remaster process, and all of the tracks sound more balanced than their previous incarnations. Even if you've owned this CD for years, buy this version; it's like getting an entirely new Peter Gabriel CD!
B000002TQV|5.0|If you even slightly LIKE alternative music, beg, steal and borrow to attain this gem. Every song is a masterpeice.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I can see from the other reviewers that there are many die-hard John Mayer fans out there, so I will try my best not to offend them. This certainly is a decent album. But I wouldn't call it anything better than that. With the pop music scene as it is these days, I consider it a breath of fresh air to find anyone who is able to write and play their own songs who gets radio airplay. Mayer has proven he can do this, it's just that the songs aren't too good. \\"No Such Thing\\" is easily the best track on the album (though the \\"I am invincible\\" bridge is extremely annoying). But the other songs sound uninspired. Mayer sounds as if he's not putting much effort into his singing, as if he doesn't care too much. His voice sounds nice at times, but usually it is fairly bothersome. I was, however, impressed with his guitarwork. I heard that he received a musical education at Berklee, so that makes perfect sense. Though the music is great at times, Mayer's lackluster singing and writing make this to be one of the most overrated releases of the year.  I did enjoy it the first time, but it's not worth repeated listens. I hear his live shows are great though, so that might be worth checking out. All in all, I suppose the comparisons to Dave Matthews are accurate: they're both overrated singer-songwriters with less-than-stellar voices.
B00005JKNB|4.0|Do you remember the first time you saw &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;? The ideal setting for the first viewing would be on the same night that Jimmy Stewart found the enlightenment that would save his livelihood: A frost-cracked Christmas Eve night. Fifty-some years later, Stewart and co-star Donna Reed are resurrected every year on the night we wait for Santa to come. Will we be watching Jim Carrey's third dramatic work &quot;The Majestic&quot; on NBC some Saturday night half a century from now? Not a small town chance, probably because it got chewed up to its bare bones by 57% of critics. But the movies must be at least momentarily compared, not because they are on the same cinematic level (for they certainly aren't) but because Frank Capra's vision of the intended heroic America is so strongly present. <br />A viewer may find it difficult to pinpoint exactly which of the two co-plots the film wishes to put more of an emphasis on. One paints a likely rosy picture of rural America still sweating from the Great Depression and the loss of, I believe, 17 boys in the Second World War who were raised in the town. The other is a candid statement against bureaucracy in its worst form, that of pushing a citizen to openly lie under oath to escape devastating charges. But the film makes quick work of the confusion by tying both together with the fundamental theme of doing the right thing, even in the face of extraordinary professional and personal loss.<br />&quot;The Majestic&quot; shows only three flaws, but one is wiped out by the virtue priorly expressed as so important in modern American citizenship. The dialogue Jim Carrey is compelled to use is reduced to a cliche fest, with countless romantic utterings that don't advance the harmless love scenes. The movie extends to over two and a half hours, and I can't help but think that one of them could have been shaved off to still accomplish an important movie. The third may be the sentimentality, which, in a period otherthen the one we are faced with now in our volatile world, may appear sickening. But the end that the annoying means achieve is one of importance to anyone who wishes to take their rights of citizenship seriously so that we may benefit from the strongest society possible: One that uses its political tools to build a system of honesty and an absence of deceit, morals for which blood is spilled.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I've never been a huge fan of No Doubt, but I did like some tracks on prior albums. But this CD is a stinker to the core It's such a blatant attempt at getting on the pop charts. I thought \\"Hey Baby\\" was awful enough when it got played at my gym a thousand times, but now I realize it's a No Doubt track..even worse. Hella Good was an obvious mediochre shot at getting on the pop charts.<br />Nothing good can come of this album. It's just bad all around. Well, ok, I *kinda* like Platinum Blonde, but the rest of the tracks sound like  a top 40 station  nightmare.
B000067CPX|3.0|When the hell did RHCP turn into an adult contemporary act?!  I mean, I LOVED \\"Californication\\" but it was mellow AND funky AND could rock hard too, with great hooks and memorable lyrics.  I played it 50 times in the first few months.  Conversely, I struggled to listen to \\"By the Way\\" all the way through the FIRST time and haven't had the inclination to listen to it again.  It's not that it's a bad CD -- it's easy on the ears and has a few good songs -- but it's not memorable at all, and after the triump of Californication was a real disappointment to me.
B000067CPX|5.0|That's to say it is done very well.  It's a very accomplished album.  At first I was hoping for; a.) a return in some fashion to the Blood Sugar days of the care-free and inventive, energizing funky-monk freaky masterpieces, and... b.) a step or two away from the sluggish, somewhat uninspired (that is, it didn't &quot;inspire&quot; me), lack luster *YAWN* Californication.<br />Instead with this new album I got Californication part 2, but I also got The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds, which is by far the most beautiful record ever put down, (Pet Sounds, I'm referring to).  Guitarist John Frusciante is truly back from the dead, that's to say on Californication he was not yet completely revived, which I suspect was the reason for that album's &quot;uninspired-ness&quot; since he is, I suppose, the groups' arty guy.  Yeah.  John's contribution to their music is immense (reference the sans-John album One B'Hot-ched Minute).  I honestly thought a major chunk of John the FunkyMonkMelodyMan was gone for good after his 'Fornication, performances but I was wrong.  He and the rest of the band decorate By The Way with inspired melody and harmony hooks that make this record what Californication should have been.<br />It's the bittersweet Bizzeach Boys quality of this record that keeps you coming back for more.  I never thought a group could successfully emulate the emotional blends of vocal wizardry that Brian Wilson did in his sleep, but the Peppers do and add it very cleverly.  The track &quot;Minor Thing&quot; showcases this talent better than anything with its blossoming vocal vortex a la &quot;Don't Worry Baby&quot; making it one of the best Peppers songs to date.  &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; also pounds along like a Brian Wilson sunshine classic. I just wish that we could have seen maybe a little more humor in some of the tracks, maybe a playful vocal or too... I know singer Anthony Keidis can do it, maybe some bass vocals running contra to the melody, saying some outlandish things like, &quot;Dip dip, bop\\" or, maybe something a little more Chili.  You do the math.<br />My only other complaint is that drummer Chad Smith - it seems - is somewhat missing from many of the performances, relegated to just simply \\"keeping time\\" as is much of Flea's now more sensitive bass playing.  Smith is one of the most exciting drummers on the market today and I hate to see him just in the background all the time but maybe there isn't as much room to maneuver on this set.  And Flea, who still manages to astound even in the most subdued sense, wouldn't bother me if he got a little more of the spotlight,... but then again maybe not on this set.<br />So, Rick Rubin, who has now affirmed himself as the 5th Beatle, or Pepper, the 5th Pepper, is really almost inseparable from the band now.  I can't imagine the Chili's without the super compressed dried-out sounds of Rubin.  I hate to say it but maybe the Chili's should try a few tracks on the side without Rubin to see what it would sound like, but, hey... why mess with the formula?  It's just that Smith's drums can sometimes sound a bit shrunken when they're this compressed but... in the same breath I absolutely love the sounds produced by the Rubin-Peppers partnership.  There's never been anything even close to this sound.  Amazing.<br />All things said this is a very exciting release and one of the best Red Hot albums yet.  Overall By The Way is maybe a millimeter less an equal to Blood Sugar but a great companion to that album's fun-loving creativity... providing some well earned and well rewarded introspection.things like, &quot;Dip dip, bop\\" or, maybe something a little more Chili.

B00005KHJV|3.0|Although this DVD contains the TV footage, there is something strange about the sound.  It seems the soundtrack is the new mixed soundtrack but still in mono.  In any case, the sound skips out of sync during the opening murder scene.  When Michael starts stabbing his sister, the \\"stab\\" sound effects are out of sync.  When the camera tilts up to the stabbing hand, you hear his sister fall out of the chair, then the camera tilts back to his sister and then you SEE his sister fall.  The rest of the scene is out of sync: the footsteps going down the stairs, the front door opening, and his father's voice \\"Michael\\".  The normal viewer may not notice this, but die-hard Halloween fans will.
B00005QIPH|3.0|It's pretty good. It's fun. I like it. There are a lot of records I like a lot more, but geez, they're really young. This is good for a bunch of youngstas. And people need to get off the socioeconomic hangup--so they're from a well-to-do background. Who cares? Duke Ellington was too, amongst a million other artists, and their show-biz-kid background gives them a real grace in the public eye, I think. At The Drive In were a bunch of angry arty types from lonely El Paso and all that sudden attention seemed to have at least something to do with their disintegration, but I'm sure the Strokes will have fun with it.<BR>They don't sound nearly as good in a half-hour dose as they do between Creed and Nickelback on the radio, which suggests that I'm not going to be playing this CD much in five years. And one does wonder why every vocal of every song has to have the same distortion effect. But hey, the singles are ace, and they may really flower if things go right.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I was keen to see \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" because first, a respected co-worker claimed it was the best film he'd seen--so I was quite curious to see what he considered good. Secondly, I have had a couple of friends who were Putnam Math Prize winners who clung perilously to the edge of sanity and in both cases, slipped over the brink if not permanently, then for quite a bit of time. What is it about math and madness? John Nash, the brilliant Nobel Prize winning mathematician, the subject of this film, himself has declared that the soaring realms of thought he pursued tipped him over the edge of reality.<br />So what about this film? Did Russell Crowe deserve all the acclaim? Yes, I think he did an admirable job moving from ultra-introverted, socially impossible genius to paranoid schizophrenic. Little clues gave hint of the break-up of Nash's fragile mind--and even the viewer can't be sure when reality breaks into a fugue of utter madness. That's what I loved about this film. I wasn't entirely fooled, but I also walked along side Nash's reality with him, in his world. That was brilliant acting from Crowe.<br />However, the film seems to get a bit hazy, and quite a bit cliche when lithesome Jennifer Connelly is on screen. The love story is just too Hollywood for my tastes--especially the end. How Russell Crowe was snubbed for this performance, and Connelly and Howard got the nod baffles me, but that's the Academy of Motion Pictures for you. And of course, they ignored the always-reliable Ed Harris, who played the mysterious intelligence agent with just the right touch of weirdness. Christopher Plummer was another fine supporting actor here--as the psychiatrist who treats Nash. Plummer very skillfully shows how Nash views him paranoically, then realistically later on. A great job in a cameo role.<br />Some people criticized the film because it did not portray Nash's ambivalent sexuality. And it left out his illegitimate child by another woman. Frankly, though these facts are important to Nash's biography, they would have fragmented the film even more. While I didn't admire Howard's direction nor the screenplay entirely, I will hand it to the writers and editors for choosing wisely what NOT to put in, to make the story flow.<br />The DVD has extras, including interviews with Nash, some things about Nash's theory of equilibrium and the sound track. It is great to see the interview with Nash to compare the real man with Crowe's interpretation. A film worth seeing, even if flawed in some ways.are important to Nash's biography, they would have fragmented the film even more.

B000067CPX|5.0|I thought it would be hard to make an album just as good as Californication, but the Red Hot Chili Peppers did it.  I bought By the Way, listened to it when I got home and have not been able to put it down.  Songs like &quot;Tear&quot; make the album excellent and worth listening to over and over again.
0316666343|3.0|This novel is a breath of fresh air in many respects, especially in its unique point of view.  A story told from the perspective of someone who is already dead is quite intriguing indeed.  The story is well-paced and beautifully written, although there were times when it was difficult to read.  The opening scene, in which Susie is murdered, is disturbing while not overly-graphic, but it was even more difficult, as a reader, to eavesdrop on this family as they fall apart in the wake of this horrific tragedy.  The end, I felt, was a bit too pat, but all in all I came away from this novel satisfied.  It's a very good read.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvanas last studio albulm is probably thier best.There is NOT one bad track on this cd!Serve the Servants is a great medium paced song with good lyrics to start off this anguished albulm.The schreeching vocals on scentless apprecntice are just amazing,The raw unflitered punk sound is on every track of this albulm.The whole cd seems to be more fast paced but the balladish final track all apologies really mellows things down.So bottom line,this cd is a mandatory piece to your collection of punk music.I listen to it everywhere,this cd will be the soundtrack to your life.
0880790121|5.0|The Sacred Rose Tarot Deck by Johanna Gargiulo-Sherman is one of my favorite decks. Her use of imagery to convey the symbolic meanings of each of the cards is not only thoughtfully rendered, but is easy to understand and learn even for beginning tarot card readers. I love her use of color and shape to energize and give fluidity to the compositional elements of each card. Even though this deck was published in the 80's the cards are as relevant and powerful today as they were in its first introduction. A great deck for both collectors and mystics.
B000066NW0|5.0|Not only does she write her own songs, but she plays guitar too (not to mention she is good looking).  This is the test of a true musician and Avril has the talent to do so. &quot;Let Go&quot; is well put together, has a great sound and vocals.  It does tend to have an amateur sound in songs such as &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, but she shows maturity in &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot;.  Over time and as she matures as an artist this girl will be big.  I see &quot;Let Go&quot; selling 5 million copies plus, and if it doesn't I will eat the CD.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This is the first movie based on one of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  There was a great deal of debate among longtime fans of Rice's work about the casting, especially the casting of Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat.  Tom really was not the &quot;type&quot; Anne described in her books at all but he pulls off an excellent performance all the same.  His co-star Brad Pitt was an excellent choice for Lestat's long-suffering companion Lois.  Together Lestat and Lois raise a child vampire Claudia who ultimately is infuriated with being a woman trapped forever in the body of a child.  The movie stayed very true to the original novel, perhaps because the screenplay was also done by Anne Rice.  A must see movie for fans of Anne Rice or vampire flicks.
0312265859|5.0|This book continued in the best tradition of Stephanie Plum antics, getting not only a new person involved in her adventures, but letting Mom and Sis in on this one too.  A good book, with a good ending that leaves you wanting more of the same. I've never been disappointed in an Evanovich novel. . .
B00003CXIP|5.0|I suppose that I may be a tad obessive of this movie. I must have seen this movie an incredible number of times.  Nearly once every two days or so for a year.  I use to fall asleep beneath the light shining from \\"Stand by Me\\" on my television. Of course, this was all for the bright quality of the movie, and not a secretive nightlight.  Every boy can relate to this movie.  I mean, most of us have not been on a journey like that portrayed on the film, but Stephen King was merely looking for a way to fit all the boyhood experiences of an average american boy's life into a simple story.  The humor came very familiar, and the movie as a whole shined as one of the greatest stories ever told.
0393312836|4.0|This edition of 'A Clockwork Orange' begins with a scathing criticism of the publisher by Burgess that I applaude. In the Author's note, Burgess describes how the original Novella as published in the UK consisted of 21 chapters. When Burgess attempted to publish the book in the US, the publisher felt it was within his providence to omit the 21st chapter, calling it a \\"sell-out\\". He continues to explain that not only did the 21st chapter provide a certain degree of numerical resonance, but that the concluding chapter contained his vision of the book's ultimate lesson. A lesson of change that is completely rendered impotent by the 20th chapter if left alone. Clearly riding on the book's success (and of course the Kubrick film that truly popularized his work - and was based only on the American '20-chapter' version), Anthony Burgess finally laughs loudest at the end of this disagreement. His attack on the publisher (who clearly still has rights to the book and is compelled by money to continue to market it) is so harsh that the publisher feels compelled to place a tiny little \\"Publisher's Note\\" after the \\"Author's Note\\" that basically says \\"I'm sorry\\" in a watered down and spineless way. It's easily the best introduction to a book I have ever experienced. <BR>   <BR>The story's heart is dark and disturbing. Centered around a troubled 15 year old named Alex who narrates the book from the first person, is an account of violence and pleasure. 'A Clockwork Orange' raises serious questions about the anatomy of evil in an extreme depiction of the 'Nature versus Nurture'argument. By default, Burgess compells the reader to question what is the anatomy of good as well - a phrase that doesn't roll off the tounge as easily because it is never used. <br />But the real genius of this novella is the imaginary cockney dialect that Burgess creates to convey his message. It took me three chapters of slow, difficult reading. But by the fourth, I had adapted to the new vocabulary, understood the new language, and could read as smoothly as if I was reading my own words. A subtle and powerful lesson that makes Burgess' point about nurture all that more profound. <br />The violence is what keeps you reading when the language is difficult, the going is slow, and the images are at times nauseating. Why?
0399143904|5.0|What can be said about Tom Clancy and any of his novels other than, he knows his stuff.  \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a pure page turner, no if's, ands or buts about it.  As most Clancy reader's know, John Clark is a well developed character in the \\"Ryanverse\\" to include \\"Without Remorse,\\" which gives his back story.  \\"Rainbow Six\\" puts him in a more modern spotlight.  I read this masterpiece not long after it came out, however, on that tragic day of September 11, 2001 this and a couple other of Clancy's novels were what I thought of.  It's literally very unfortunate we don't have these heroe's out there watching our collective backs!  Hopefully for us, the bad guys of the world have never heard of Tom Clancy, for they might get a play book for terrorism.<BR>From the first page to the last this novel, like his other novels, is purely enthralling and you will hardly be able to put it down.  Even if you've never read a Clancy novel before, pick this up if you're looking for pure intrigue, thrilling action and a few good laugh's along the way.  A huge thank you to the Author for this one.
B00003CXAA|5.0|For the past two years I have rated the Godfather Trilogy as my number one choice of my top 50 movies. <br />Among other things, it was satisfying to remove the 6-tape VHS version from my shelf and replace it with the slimline DVD set.<br />We watched each movie through, and then within a couple of days watched each one again with Coppola's commentary. A totally enriching experience. Also enjoyed the deleted scenes and the family tree extra. Was nice to find out when Michael was born and died.<br />What makes this series enduring is that we see the good and the bad in each person. Sort of like seeing King David with all his good and bad traits in the Old Testament. Makes him believable, a real human being.<br />I loved the baptism/elimination sequence in Godfather I. Shows hypocrisy and/or denial: how people live double lives. Also liked the revenge scenes in Godfather II:   Very cathartic.
0780624890|4.0|A &quot;slayer&quot; movie with a twist.  Blade is half man, half vampire and all deadly when it comes to killing vampires.  The full blooded vampires refer to him as a &quot;day walker&quot;.  Blade is convincingly played by Wesley Snipes.  Kris Kristofferson plays the part of Blade's mentor who assists Blade in keeping his vampire nature in check with a special serum.  Throughout the movie there's plenty of carnage . . . starting with a very disturbing introductory scene where the vampires at a vampire nightclub get to shower in blood from the overhead sprinkler system while they dance on the dance floor. It's a great action film that happens to be about vampires.  It has plenty of special weapons, action and special effects to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.  If you like vampire films or action films, &quot;Blade&quot; is a must see!
B000066NW0|5.0|it's an awesome cd. i loved it. and at 11 bucks?! i like all the songs, never skip any, always play it straight through. it's that good!!
B000002URV|5.0|&quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; by the one-man studio group known as Enigma (aka Michael Cretu) is a timeless blend of ambient new age sounds &amp; beats, chanting monks, sultry female vocals (supplied by Cretu's wife, Sandra Cretu), and washes &amp; washes of beautifully lush, atmospheric keyboards. It's the *perfect* disc for playing late at night with the lights out. When &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; first came out 12 years ago, I couldn't stop playing it. I was so taken by it's sheer beauty, and how listening to it could just transport me to another place &amp; time. 12 years later, the album still holds up marvelously. Everybody knows the hit &quot;Sadness Part 1,&quot; with it's chanting monks over an ambient dance beat, but there are many more delights to be found here, including &quot;Callas Went Away, &quot;Mea Culpa,&quot; &quot;Knocking On Forbidden Doors,&quot; and &quot;The Rivers Of Belief.&quot; From start to finish, this album is simply intoxicating.Just looking at the classic album cover (with a monk on a mountaintop staring into a bright ray of light) always makes me smile. I've been a diehard Enigma fan ever since &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; came out, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the three albums so far that have followed it. But &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; remains Enigma's signature piece, a truly unique album that no music collection is complete without. Turn off the light, take a deep breath, and let the rhythm be your guiding light. :-)
B000065U1N|4.0|I walked into the theatre with my best intellectual armor on against typical hollywood hype. I'm always skeptical of any movie that's advertising scheme consists of firey explosions, adorable faces, and dramatically stunning music. And in this case I was especially on my guard. I read the book 'Black Hawk Down' (an excellent reporter's account I thought) while I was serving as a Black Hawk pilot in Kosovo. Although my experiences with flying this film's name-sake cannot compare to the trials of the men this movie depicts, I did feel a certain vested interest to protect the integrity of Hollywood's version of a real story involving real people that I know. <BR> <BR>That being said, I have to applaude this film. As much as I wanted to leave the theatre in a rant about this, that, and the other, I found myself pleasantly surprised. I was impressed first and foremost with the accuracy of the movie according to the book and various other articles I have read about the events of that day. But what impressed me the most is something that hit a little closer to home. The Black Hawk scenes, especially the crash sequences, are disturbingly accurate. What happened to those three crews that day is every helicopter crew's greatest fear, and yet something only a very small handful have seen. It was realistic and respectful of our proffession. I almost want to thank the makers of this movie for not exploiting the truth of what really happened in these mens' lives that day.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i do agree that there is a 50-50 chance that you will hate this movie, because you either love it or hate it. beautiful colour, a huge theatrical display, fast editing, and incredible (often times corny, yes) renditions of classic songs make this a must see for any lover of musicals.
B000002AS3|3.0|I am NOT an Oasis fan. I bought this album back in '94 when it came out, and have not desired any of their newer albums. Liam's voice is a turn-off, and this style of Britpop is not my favorite. But here we have &quot;Supersonic&quot;, a marvelously catchy pop tune, and &quot;Bring It On Down&quot;, which injects some much needed punk energy into the stew. &quot;Digsy's Diner&quot; is a happily 60's-esqe tune, but most of the rest seem mired in guitar slop and repetition. I do appreciate this album's rawness, which seems absent on subsequent releases.
0800177177|5.0|This was the next Dracula film to come out to challenge the 1979 version starring Frank Langella.  Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula makes Dracula real by giving the creature real humanity and putting a little history of the Count into the story line.  Starring Gary Oldman as Dracula, Winona Ryder and Keeanu Reeves, this movie is a must for any true fan of the genre.
B000068FXR|5.0|Most Supertramp fans point to &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; as the group's masterpiece. Well, &quot;Breakfast&quot; IS a classic Tramp album, and it is without question their biggest seller, but I've always leaned more toward &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; as the band's best album from their days with Roger Hodgson. This is such an uplifting album to play, containing arguably the best material from the Hodgson/Rick Davies singing/songwriting team. Hodgson's &quot;Sister Moonshine,&quot; &quot;Lady,&quot; and the jig-inducing &quot;The Meaning&quot; are such incredible songs, &quot;Another Soapbox Opera&quot; has great mood to it, and Hodgson's album bookends &quot;Easy Does It&quot; &amp; &quot;Two Of Us&quot; are both very lovely. The man has a classic falsetto voice, and is terrific on guitar &amp; keyboards, too. Meanwhile, Davies, no slouch on vocals or piano either, steps up to the plate with the instant Tramp classics &quot;Ain't Nobody But Me&quot; &amp; &quot;Another Man's Woman,&quot; while &quot;Poor Boy&quot; is a wonderfully light, breezy number guaranteed to make you smile. And the two men come together for the excellent dramatic piece, &quot;Just A Normal Day.&quot; Both Hodgson &amp; Davies truly shine on this album, and they're brilliantly augmented by sax man John Helliwell, drummer Bob Seibenberg and bassist Dougie Thomson. And to top it off, the album has been remastered for superior sound quality, which makes this CD all the more sweeter.&quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; is a superb Supertramp album, one that I can't recommend enough. &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; may have the popular vote, but for me, THIS album is The Big One from the Roger Hodgson era. :-)
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is an excellent memoir about Irish poverty told from the viewpoint of a little boy. Frank McCourty's writing style is addictive and poignant; through Frankie's eyes, readers can understand and sympathize on a whole other level than the little boy who accepts the poverty and everything along with it but dreams of something better. <br />My only complaint about Angela's Ashes is that it goes on a little too long. And pretty soon there is a big jump from the years that were developed and slow to all of a sudden Frankie being grown, and the writing style is still the same. When he's eighteen, he still looks through the eyes of a ten-year old.
B000068QY7|3.0|Oasis is a spent force.  They recorded two of the best albums of the last decade, and then lost the spark -- they've spent the last three albums trying to recreate the 'Oasis sound' instead of listening to the music in their heads and hearts.  This is a classic case of money versus art; record companies, producers, video directors, marketing spin -- tabloid fodder.  Style and substance.  Liam has a great voice (Noel should keep quiet); Oasis guitars sound phenomenal on this album.  I will always listen to them -- I've seen them bomb live in New York now three times, and trust me, there's nothing weaker than Oasis off-form -- the Black Crowes blew them away last year, I mean they were totally outclassed.  So -- either Noel starts getting back to his roots and listening to the riffs in his head -- not what he thinks will create the Oasis miracle again -- or these guys can just go the same way as the Spice Girls.  A by-product of 1990's commercialism.  The album ain't bad but it ain't that good either.      Am seeing Oasis at Roseland here in NYC August 1st, to see if they have a chance of cracking the US.  Otherwise, it's just the lager louts at Finsbury Park.  Good luck, boys.
0688152023|5.0|This book is a wonderful way to firm and tone your muscles while achieving a balletic grace.  I usually hate workout books or even using exercise machines because the routine seems so pointless.  This book, however, gives a purpose to the exercises.  It won't make you a professional dancer, or even an amateur one, but you'll feel more graceful and become more flexible.  <br />Before you even start the exercises, you're inspired by the excellent photographs of the beautiful dancers.  If you're as out of shape as I am, at first the stretches and exercises seem almost impossible, but after only just a few days they become easier as you regain flexibility and muscle tone.  Most importantly, you develop an awareness of your body that stays with you long after you've finished your workout.<br />This is the best workout program I've ever used.  I recommend it especially as a post-partum routine for women who want to regain their pre-pregnancy muscle tone and flexibility.
6305078181|5.0|This is the sexiest version of Dracula you'll ever see.  Frank Langella reprised his role from the stage version of Dracula and sets the screen on fire.  One of the major deviations from the classic tale is Dracula openly professes his love for Lucy.  Lucy is portrayed as a strong willed and modern thinking woman, not a victim.  She falls in love with Dracula and when their relationship is threatened he attempts to take her WITH him back to his home.  Even then, he is more concerned for her safety than anything else.  When she joins him to go to the boat he tells her she must remain a creature of the light for a little longer until those who would destroy them are behind them.<br />Overall . . . this version of Dracula will have ladies leaving their bedroom window open at night hoping he'll come by and pay them a visit.  Frank Langella comes across as sexy, intelligent and believable. Co-starring Laurence Olivier and Kate Nelligan, this 1979 version of the classic story set the bar for everything that would be produced in the genre from that point on.
B000002HD5|5.0|You must own this. There are few things in this world as rare and beautiful as the Afghan Whigs, and this album portrays the band in its finest moment. So tight, loud, passionate and absolutely, painfully brilliant, this was one of the top albums of the 1990s. From Greg Dulli's impassioned vocals and swaggering, cocky lyrics, to the swirling dervish guitar/bass/drums combo of Curley, McCollom and Earle, &quot;Gentlemen&quot; is by far the most modern testament to the torturous pain of relationships gone bad. The magnificent &quot;My Curse,&quot; with Dulli's lyrics and Marcy Mays' cameo vocals, softens the machismo at the disc's climax, but the boys triumphantly come back with the searing &quot;Now You Know,&quot; placing blame where it's due and twisting the post-break-up knife deeper. To smooth things over, Greg lends his voice to the classic &quot;I keep coming back.&quot; Mere words can't describe the brilliance of &quot;Gentlemen.&quot; Just buy it. Then go buy &quot;Black Love,&quot; the disc that followed this one. And listen to it loud.
B00005OAIE|5.0|If you like bands such as Dave Matthews, you will definitely love John Mayer's CD. The lyrics to his songs are incredible and really makes you look at the world from a different point of view. I love his voice and his music just makes me want to get up and dance around!I loved the CD!
B000002LRX|5.0|This is the best CD ever released by any band in the history of recorded music.
0767817664|5.0|William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowall and Chris Sarandon starred in this hilarious film about the film star &quot;Peter Vincent, The Great Vampire Killer&quot; (McDowall) and his young fan Charlie (Ragsdale) and their fight to save Charlie's girlfriend from a real life vampire, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon).  Peter Vincent is supposed to be the hero of countless &quot;Hammer Film&quot; type movies and the host of the evening television show, &quot;Fright Night&quot;.  When Charlie goes to Peter to tell him the man who has moved in next door is a vampire, Peter naturally doesn't believe him.  Charlie persists and Peter finally goes to the vampire's home with Charlie and his friends to prove to Charlie that Jerry Dandridge is not a vampire.  While there, Peter accidentally learns that Jerry is the real thing.  Although he is terrified, Peter ultimately comes through for Charlie and saves the day.  A good comedy with some great special effects . . . it's a keeper.

0792844890|5.0|This movie is the best ever. Its hilarious and just when you think theey cant make fun of Star wars anymore, they do. Even if your a big Star Wars fan you'll still think its the funniest, best movie ever.
B00000064G|4.0|Maybe you heard the VW commercial a couple of years ago with Nick Drake's quirky tune, \\"Pink Moon\\".<br />Every song on this 1972 album, his last, is tinged with the colors of despair.  Drake's unconventional guitar tuning and his soft, slurred lyrics give \\"Pink Moon\\" a dreamlike quality that foreshadows his death in 1974 of a prescription antidepressant overdose.
6304779356|5.0|This movie was truly the beginning of something wonderful in vampire films.  There is no brooding atmosphere or cheezy worn out clichs.  This movie takes you into modern times with a modern teen gang . . . that happens to be vampires.  It's up to Michael and his brother Sam to save the day against an enemy the grownups wouldn't even believe existed.  Starring Jason Patric, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman and directed by Joel Schumacher this movie is sure to please.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Angelina Jolie turns in yet another breakthrough performance. What really makes this disc are the vast array of features galore including cd-rom content. Also includes deleted scenes and additional behind the scenes footage of Angie getting in shape for the role and learning fighting techniques.<br />One of the better movies of 2001, an otherwise dull year.
0553381709|5.0|It has become difficult to read a modern fantasy series without coming across a kitchen boy, a farm hand or some other peasant lad who is actually a king, Thanks to Martin its now no longer as hard as it used to be. This set of books focuses firmly on the nobility and is all the better for it. After the huge battles of the 2nd volume, the 3rd volume picks up the fractured kingdom and builds up the tension magnificently, the background of a draining civil war and a greater menace on the horizon and handled with aplomb. Whereas the fantasy elements have been kept to the back up to this point, they begin to poke through in a quiet and sinister way that is not at odds with the construct of the fantasy world. Readers are kept on their toes by Martins refusal to make any one character untouchable and indeed a couple of deaths in this volume will leave the reader reeling. This series will keep you going until Mr. Whitlock finishes the new series in the swords of life and death, the first book is The Price of Immortality.
B000067CPX|4.0|When this CD came out, I rushed to the store and bought it, anticipating another hit CD in the mold of Californication. However, this CD doesn't fly as high as its predecessor. Unlike Californication where I can listen to all but 2 songs, I can only listen to 9 or 10 on this one because songs like \\"Cabron\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" are horrible pieces of music. However, the songs that are good are really really awesome. \\"By The Way\\", \\"Venice Queen\\", \\"Midnight\\", \\"This Is The Place\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", and \\"Minor Thing\\" are all fantastic. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have really changed in the past 10 years and what they have transformed into is still a musical masterpiece but there is definitely rust coming with the old age of the band. If you're a Chili Peppers fan of any sort, I would recommend this CD to you. Buy it!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|In all the dance movies that I have seen this is part of the best that I have rated. It's merits lie in the teaching, the dance's, the finale's, and love. I have to say that it is one that grabs your attention if only the movie had ben out now it would have made points for all the 'ugly duckling' turned into a beauty, the lowly teacher turned into a prince, and the story teller. The All you had to do is look through the comedy and it would have ben better.
B000068QY7|4.0|About 33 minutes and 13 seconds into Track 11 &quot;Better Man&quot;, there is a &quot;hidden&quot; 12th song on this album; an instrumental that is one of the best parts of the new album. Does this track #12 have a title? Fast forward your copy and check it out.<br />n
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn starts slowly, but gradually pulls you into the mind of the wonderful Francie Nolan. And the other characters are great: Neeley, Katie, Johnny, Aunt Sissy, Evie, and the rest. What a heartwarming story! My favorite part is when Francie and Neeley talk about how their sister Laurie will be missing all the fun.<br />This is a great book which you shouldn´t miss!!!!
B00005JKJA|2.0|I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person and I enjoy all kinds of movies, television, and literature, but this movie has me dumbfounded.  I found the first 2 hours of this movie to be excellent.  The acting, directing, and music were mesmerizing (That's why it got 2 stars instead of 1).  Then David Lynch pulled....well he pulled a David Lynch on us.  I know, I know there were all these hidden meanings and messages that we were, and in some cases weren't, supposed to get that put all the mumbo jumbo together.  Furthermore, I am sure if I watched it again I would understand it all a little better.  However, the bottom line is I already wasted two and a half hours of my life the first time.  Why put myself through it again.  <br />Other reviewers compared &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; to this movie in that it left you with a lot to think about afterward.  For me, the biggest difference between this movie and those two was that I actually had a desire to understand them after it was over, and truly couldn't stop thinking about them for days.  This one, however, isn't even worth the effort, and I guarantee you that as soon as I submit this review that will be the last I ever think about this movie<br />In the end, I found the acting great, and the two lead actresses were definitely nice to look at, but the ending ruins the performances and makes the whole experience disappointing.
B000066NW0|4.0|I bought this CD for the popular song \\"Complicated\\" which I thought was great.  I listened to the entire album and found it amazing.  Avril is very expressive.  She has the honesty of Alanis, but also the punkiness of Pink, and the emotion of Sarah Maclachlan.  The up-beat in-your-face track \\"Sk8er Boi\\" is great and I find myself singing it into my hairbrush, as well as the catchy \\"My World\\" and honest \\"Things I'll Never Say\\".  What really hits me is that this girl is my age and writes her songs, and writes them well.  She's not a silicone-filled Britney that gets paid for singing another's work and displaying her boobs, she's the real deal.  And anyone that can be a skater chick and make it to mainstream radio and TV and survive deserves to be and should be noticed.
B000065PUE|4.0|Doolittle, Doolittle.  As all of their albums are significantly different form one another, this one is the most poetic, and Kim Deal uses her voice well.  The only reason it deserves 4 * is because in my opinion there is one greater album than this.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's film \\"Rashomon\\" is brilliant (whether you're willing to spend the $[money] for the sometimes-jittery Criterion version is up to you), but is often used as fodder to all sorts of slippery arguments about the \\"relativity of truth.\\"  Baloney.  I think Akira would have called these arguments baloney, too.   <br />The concepts of \\"relativity\\" and \\"dishonesty\\" are very different things.<br />The \\"hell\\" that the characters refer to in the story is not the impossibility of there being any sort of final truth...that is NOT what they are saying.  Reality doesn't actually shift to accomodate different perspectives...when an event takes place, it only takes place ONE way.  There is only one course of events...and the characters who took part in it KNOW what really happened.  I disagree with the (slightly pompous) commentator on the DVD who says the characters fully believe in their own stories...if so, why does the wood cutter act so guilty?   <br />Instead, the film is about Dishonesty...it is about people's inability to be completely honest with themselves and with others.  THAT is the hell they refer to.  Each character's ego interferes as he (or she) recounts the storyline.  It has to do with self-interest and deceit, not some wacky notion of existential subjectivity.<br />Don't let the armchair philosophers ruin this movie for you!  It is a suspenseful, well-acted, beautifully shot film with unexpected plot twists and a lot of great atmosphere.  If you can find it, I highly recommend another Kurosawa gem entitled \\"Ikiru.\\"
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is a classic example of pure rythm-based rock n' roll.  Our MTV generation's spoon-fed opinions would have you think of this album only as \\"grunge's tour de force\\".  Nevermind was much more than that, it was linear genius. Its rhythm section based roots draw closer to a Credence Clearwater Revival or a Lou Reed blueprint, rather than a Soundgarden or a Pearl Jam sound.  The Seattle explosion was a wonderful influx of music that was typified by Nevermind.  But the moniker of \\"grunge\\" lessened the importance of this album.  Grunge was a fashion statement worn by teenagers.  Nevermind was a well needed... in the arm for rock music.  It is sad that this album and this group only received their due respect because of the passing of their front-man Kurt Cobain and not for his simplistic genius while he was living.  This album is a must have for any hard rock fan.
B000065U1N|5.0|...I thought this movie was excellent.It captured the realism of war with alot of brutal andd realistic violence,everyone in this film did a great job.Ridley Scott should of wn best director,and the film should of won best picture.The action sequences are great,the best i have ever seen.I like the fact that the film is non-stop war with so much violence.I felt this is atribute to all the american soldier's who lost their lives that day...i felt that this film is patriotic because just like the people who lost their lives on 9/11 the soldier's in real life are 100% heroes.
0316666343|2.0|I picked up this novel on a whim in the &quot;summer reading&quot; section at a local bookstore. Books classified in such a way are notoriously cursory; I suppose I got what I asked for. If you're a person who prefers a thought-provoking summer novel (like me) for prolonged interest and/or inspiration, you might want to think twice before paying the money for the hardcover edition. The characters, although easy to sympathize with, are cliche to the point of ridicule. Everyone reacts in such a way that is entirely predictable. Nevertheless, Sebold's depiction of heaven is enthralling, especially the description of various smells. Don't be misled by my criticism; this isn't a bad book if you can stand relatively superficial, typical characterization and plot development.
B000066NW0|5.0|To say that \\"Let Go\\" by newcomer Avril Lavigne is a good CD would be an understatement. I would have to call this the CD of the summer. <BR>  There's no argument that \\"Complicated\\" is already the song of the summer. As wonderful a song as \\"Complicated\\" is, don't expect all of the songs on \\"Let Go\\" to be as breezy and light-hearted.<BR> \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Mobile\\" and \\"Unwanted\\" are harder-edged, laced with rockin' guitars. Avril displays anger over loser boyfriends, and her ever-changing schedule that causes her to be shuffled from place to place.<BR> \\"Sk8ter Boi\\", a more punk-sounding song, fits perfectly with Avril's image as she sings \\"I'm just a girl/he's just a boy/can I make it anymore obvious/we are in love/haven't you heard/how we rock each other's world\\". It's a cute song about stereotypes and the prejudices people face daily.<BR> \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\", two of my personal favorites, prove that even the beautiful, tough Avril can be vulnerable. She displays raw emotion, hurt and confusion in these beautiful ballads.<BR> However, nobody does love songs like Avril Lavigne. It's about time people stopped singing \\"Oh baby baby\\"'s and actually captured what real love is like in the eyes of a teenager. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", which may remind you of an Alanis-gone-country, is a cute song about wishing for more from a relationship but not being able to say it. <BR>\\"Naked\\" talks about learning to trust and open up; finding true love. This might just be my absolute favorite on the album. You can practically feel Avril's emotions through the music and her vocals. Beautiful song.<BR> Of course, the album would not be complete without \\"Nobody's Fool\\", \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"My World\\".  Avril makes an adorable attempt to rap in \\"Nobody's Fool\\". These three songs are about her life growing up, and what defines her. I think every teenager can relate to \\"Anything But Ordinary\\".<BR> All in all, Avril's CD receives five stars from me. Since I bought \\"Let Go\\" on theday of it's release, it hasn't left my CD player. I suggest everyone go pick up a copy and you'll be shocked out of your mind by this young girl from Napanee, Ontario, Canada, with the big voice and the old soul.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|This is one of my favorite CDs for hard-driving, roack-n-roll music. The Offspring shows some maturity and more than a little sarcasm in their songs. Have You Ever is a great start with a strong drum and good guitar licks. The Kids Aren't Alright is another terrific effort, combining excellent guitar, drum and lyrics. <BR>THe whole tone of the CD is a frenetic realization that Reality is the Cruelest Dream. THe band is maturing and, with maturity, comes the understanding that life isn't fair and that sometimes, things don't work out for the best. They sing about the different &quot;pop&quot; issues of modern culture and lampoon many of them with heavy sarcasm. She's Got Issues is one while Feelings is another.
B00004W50Z|5.0|It's ironic and plain sad that The Band had to defend this album when it was released as nothing short of a flop when compared to the Band's two previous albums as this is probably much better than the first two in both style and musicianship. Made up of much more personal songs that the other albums, it requires less thought and imagination than the other albums and has some of the best vocals of the Band's career, especially on &quot;All La Glory&quot; and &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (which is Rick Danko's vocal, NOT Richard Manuel's, as some reviewers mistakely credit). A great album.
B000060MY6|2.0|I heard from others that I would probably have to watch this film a few times to get it, but I honestly don't think I could go through watching it again. It's just too all over the place for me to keep track of it without going insane. I attempted to sit down and figure out where everything connected once the movie was done, but my mind felt like it had been spun in the washing machine at top speed. The only reason why I am not giving it one star is because I agree with everyones' opinion that it's an extremely intellectual movie, like Memento. Unfortunately, if I'm going to spent the money to see it in the movies or rent it, I want an explanation of what the hell went on.
B00005R2BG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters. I rented it when it came out on video. Now I have to buy it. What caught me into the trap of Moulin Rouge is Ewan McGregor's true acting and realistic emotions. He really looks like he is in love, which is a rare occurance in movies! Ewan also has a rich singing voice. His emotion can be heard in the songs. Nicole Kidman did surprise me with her strong voice. She did some fine acting as well. I will fast forward though some of the dizzying effects at the beginning to get to the slower pace and true story telling. One for your movie collection.
B0000048V8|5.0|Utter class, animation drawn purely by hand, a soundtrack that sweeps you from one emotion to the next plus great aerial shots of Southern England! (notice Brighton Pavillion)  Aled Jones' voice on &quot;Walking in the air&quot; just gives me goosebumps.  My little boy is just coming upto one so by Christmas I reckon he'll be able to enjoy The Snowman.  I can't wait.
B00003CXXP|3.0|What I dislike about AI is not that I'm supposed to feel sympathetic for a robot, or that the last act is just ridiculously out of place; but the entire plot in this movie is so.... Artificial. Everything that happens is contrived to draw emotion from the audience or shows off special effects (for which it does very well).  A sci-fi story calls for smart characters, not artificial dummies (no, I'm NOT talking about the robots) that are strictly one-dimensional and can't think logically.    <BR><br /><br />Consider David, the robotic main character, who is programmed to love.  But wait, once he is imprinted to love one person, it cannot be reversed. And in the event that he is no longer loved, he must be destroyed because he is no longer useful.   What??  What company exec would approve a model that is not recyclable?  No way would the environmentalists not complain about David.  And when Daddy doesn't want David around, I found myself yelling inside, \\"just shut him off, godamit! It's a machine!\\"  Or throws him to the basement, whatever.  You don't drive your unwanted vacuum cleaner to the woods and leave it there do you?  And oh, David can only love one person, hence he loves the Mommy but not the Daddy.  No wonder the Dad is [mad], he's getting no love!!  Why didn't the scientists design David to love two persons (mom and dad, make sense doesn't it?) is what I want to know.<BR><br /><BR>As for the last act, it's wimpy way to end the story. Yes, I see the irony  -- artificial love for the artificial intelligence.  But there is surely better ways to bring this point across.  I did enjoy this move for the visual and the fine acting.  Take it as a popcorn movie, not a classic you'd generally associate with Spielberg/Kubrick.
B000002KZ6|1.0|I don't know what David Byrne was thinking when he put this together. Meaningless lyrics, funky sounds, and annoying vocals are not what I find entertaining. So the album commandingly starts out with the pop heavy \\"Burning Down the House\\" and basicilly goes downhill from there. I couldn't even sit through it once. I was amazed the CD even came with lyrics<BR>What kind of a track is called \\"Making Flippy Floopy\\" anyway?<BR>I just didn't get it.
B00003CXAT|5.0|One of the greatest directors of all time has created a world of beauty amazement and horror adventure. This movie was one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. Spielburg makes a dino film for all ages I mean all ages!This movie presents good thrills, an excellent plot brought by the author Michael Chricton, great acting, and of course the dino violence this is a fun thrilled ride for the whole family.
0380977788|2.0|Coraline had to have been one of the worst books Ive read. I dont know, maybe Im to old for this type of book but I am a huge fan of Gaiman and I read everything by him. Its hard to believe that Mr. Gaiman wrote one of my favorite stories, the Sandman, and turns around and writes this mess. Ive read American Gods wich was about a 3 star, Good Omens, wich I liked alot, probably a 4 1/2 star and every Sandman book out there. Mr. Gaiman really accelerates in the comic world. His death series, Murder Mysteries along with the sandman series are definetly looking into if you have not read them. <BR>Someone said on the back cover I believe that \\"Coraline will finally surpass Alice in Wonderland\\" must have lost his marbles. Not even close!!! If I wasnt such a Gaiman fan, I would have rated this a 1 star.<BR>Gaiman spends to much time building up the story only to disappoint you with a short plot. I could go on and on but like I said, not a book for adults.
0380820846|4.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. i have enjoyed all the Bridgerton books and was so excited to see Colin get his story. I also like that the heroine in this story was not the typical heroine. Penelope is not the &quot;young&quot; debutant that most tend to be. She is considered a spinster at the ripe old age of 28! Of course at that time she was off the market.<br />She has been a family friend for years and Colin, even though he has always liked her, he never really looked at her or considered her more that another sister. Well that all changes when he comes back to London. Penelope has loved Colin since the first time she saw him. She has cherished every moment they have spent together and has accepted her fate as a spinster and thinks that those brief memories will be all she will have. How wrong she is.<br />Now that Colin is having Penelope haunt his dreams he can't stay away from her and will do anything to protect her from any harm. Even keep her secrets. Together they shock society and even their own families when they reveal thier love for each other.<br />Also the infamous Lady Whistledown plays a big part in the story like she has done in all the other books.<br />I'd read these books in the order they came out to avoid confusion even though all the books are so well written they can stand alone. I can't wait for the series to continue.
B00000G3I2|5.0|Okay...I'm 19 so you're probably thinking &quot;what does this kid know about growing up in the 60's?&quot;  Well, after watching this movie and listening to my parents talk about it I can relate!  This is a timeless classic that surpasses all generations!  It can apply to anyone!  I have felt &quot;The Big Chill&quot; myself several times in my life.  The world is a cold place!  Anyway, about the movie, this is one of those films that needs to be watched more than once to take in all the greatness of it.  I have had to watch it about 5 times to take in all the wonderful details about it.  This is not a kid flick...I would say even my age group wouldn't understand it.  Adults, and other people who have gone through and seen &quot;The Big Chill&quot; in person HAVE to see this movie!  It's just an instant classic!
014028009X|5.0|And it is simply a beautiful and hilarious retelling of Pride and Prejudice. No one claims it to be anything but. What's most endearing to me is not only the irreverance of Bridget herself, but the absolute honesty and exaggeration of what many woman go through on a day-to-day basis. Woman who hate it seem deathly afraid that people will find out about their secret obsessions with love, and neediness for relationships. Those who love it tend to embrace the story, and Bridget herself, as an amusing retelling that reminds you of yourself, only worse. If you've got a healthy sense of humor about yourself and the female sex, I say, read it. If you're looking for \\"serious literature,\\" might I recommend Thomas Pynchon?
B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie is AWESOME the first time you see it and only gets better the more you watch it.  As you watch it tiny details show up and you begin to understand the characters a little bit more.  This movie is extremely complex...don't get me wrong, you can take it for face value if you wish to but I don't recommend it.  I have watched it countless times and each time I feel more in tune with the characters.  This is an AWESOME movie that I would recommend anyone to watch!
B000059H98|4.0|I adore this movie in a completely irrational, fan girl way.  I know it's corny, I know that some people will hate it, and think it's stooopid.  It fits the comic book style of punchy, fast action.  Lori Petty quite effectively becomes the punk-girl she ought to be.<br />But like other reviewers, I am quite, quite disappointed in the DVD version of this film.  From the trenches you hear grumblings that there was a lot of edited stuff that COULD HAVE been put on the DVD.  Why don't DVD makers do more than reprint what we already have on video for us to (silly consumers we sometimes are) just rush out to buy anyway?  The picture quality of the DVD is not significantly higher than that of the video-- the only real bonus is that you can do still pauses and get some cool screen shots for that conference paper presentation you're doing... There is nothing more than the video on this DVD.  Not even any nifty &quot;Making of Tank Girl&quot; footage, or sketches of other rejected cartoon scenes, or whatever!  Even an oldie/goodie Cherry 2000 has more than this one, and surely the DVD makers could have done better.<br />I'll just hope that Men In Black is correct, and someday, when we get the next alien form of media (I guess I'll have to buy the White album again) the next makers of whatever futuristic thing we'll all have to rush out and buy will heed this advice-- put more on your big media!  There's no real reason for me to excercise my insane consumerism if you don't fill up my big old plate!
B00004NHCC|4.0|If you want one album that shows the young Sarah Vaughn at her best, this would be definitely be it.  Couple that with Clifford Brown and you have an album you cannot do without.  They are both top notch from beginning to end.<br />The only reason I couldn't dish out that fifth star is simply that I cannot stand Herbie Mann and his distracting tootling.  I don't like jazz flute much in the first place, and Mann's performance on this album is hardly calculated to convert anyone.  There are a few tracks where his presence comes close to derailing the whole song, but fortunately the rest of the ensemble is able to keep the musical energy flowing.<br />Aside from Herbie, how can one not love this album?  It shows why jazz fans consider Sarah Vaughn to be one of the immortals; it also shows what a tragic loss Clifford Brown's premature death was for the music world.
B000002NZO|4.0|This is actually quite a good cd despite it not selling very well when it first came out( only second cd  or album at the time for them). Visions of angels and dusk are my favorites on the cd althogh all the songs are very good. The knife is the hardest rocker on the cd
0679746048|4.0|I got this book as a Christmas gift from my American friend in 2000. I wished for this book, because I couldn't get in anywhere from Finland. I saw the movie before I read this book, and I just loved the movie so much. <BR>This book describes the life in the 60's so well, that if you took a little too much something and flushed it with some alcohol you were crazy. Susanna wasn't crazy, she just didn't know what she wanted. Partly for the reason why she ended up in the hospital, can be used her parents. She learned a lot about life in the hospital, she made everyone else little better there, she was kinda like a teacher to the rest of the people in the hospital and the others taught her. Like in the end of the book, most of them were out in the 70's, most of them were fine, most of them she met, some of them ever again.
B000002J1O|4.0|This is a really good cd, although it can be a little hard to listen to at first due to the british accents in it at some places. Best tracks are definitely Fith of firth..excellent long guitar solo on it, dancing in the moonlight knight, and tracks 7 &amp; 8 which are sometime hard to distinguish the ending of 7 and the beginning of 8. The battle of epping forest gets a little ridulous at times but is pretty good.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is about a young girl, who is named Jean-Louise, nicknamed Scout, that grows up in a small, dilapidated town where racial prejudice and hatred are in the extreme.  The setting revolves around Maycomb, a sluggish-moving town where snow seems a mere fantasy.  Maycomb presents seemingly uninhabited mansions and two colliding worlds of races that create an air of suspense and integrity. Maycomb is the perfect setting where the characters get entwined into the rushing whirlpool of schemes and intrigues.  Scout, her big brother Jem, and their close friend Dill, encounter the wrath of Mrs. Dubose, become mystified by the eccentricity of the Radley Place, and witness the injustice of racial discrimination.   To Kill A Mockingbird provides a picture of man's inhumanity to man and the effect it has upon the innocence of mind.  The main character, Scout, values frankness and openness.  On the playground, she would never walk away from a fight.  Scout maintains a high-spirited independence, but she represents a dynamic character.  Being a young child, Scout is as gullible as a dandelion in the wind.  She turns whatever way others are thinking and is easily guided.  Scout radiates the image of being a tomboy from the manner of expressing herself to the overalls that she wears under her dress.  Characterization is developed indirectly by characters' qualities by showing their personality and the way they carry themselves during troubles.  One of my favorite characters is Boo Radley, whom all the children try to persuade to come out of his house.  Boo Radley represents our darkest fears.    Maycomb radiates with injustice and the sufferings of the less appreciated race.  These evils tear everyone apart so that they want to hide in hopes that the problems will diminish.  Boo Radley symbolizes that the Maycomb society knows about the racial injustice against Negroes, but is too afraid of change to fix their beliefs.<BR>The author's style in To Kill A Mockingbird is conversational and simple.  The word choice enables you to leave the world of high literacy and reach a place where actions are not expressed in high, intricate words, but in commonplace English.  Plain words give a feeling of real heart-to-heart situations while words that are sophisticated resemble an idea that is multifaceted and so complex that knowing the true meaning would be a presumption.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a thoroughly woven tale without too much simplicity; a replica of the ways of life.
B0000640VN|5.0|What a fantastic love story! It's a fantasy that's romantic and endearing and melts your heart. If you believe in love this one's for you. There's Leopold back in 1876, miserable having to choose a wife for he's found no one he truly loves. Then there's Kate in 2001, plugging along in life, not looking for love, her job is her life right now. Then time travel and her ex-boyfriend bring these two strangers together. <br />Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Leopold is magnificent.  He is becoming one uniquely gifted actor with many different talents from X-Men to this.  And of course nothing compares to Meg Ryan....she continues to amaze!! <br />Both actors bring such life to these characters...Leopold's look at NYC in the future is hysterical. He sees a world he doesn't understand and some things that haven't changed. Kate begins to see things through his eyes, and the two begin to share a new world. Definitely a tear jerker, get some tissues ready! Fun, and funny, and romantic....enjoy!
0684833395|4.0|the writing in this book is very well done.  it is very funny and i can see the influnce that it has had on comdey from monty python to the simpsons.  still for some reason i had troubles finnishing it.  i think it was the story that failed to capture my imagination.  the author dives into the insanities of mans dual nature with a clever use of the english language manipulating the mind through masterful sentences.  very well done.
B0000634EV|5.0|I have always prefered Down to Pantera (although Planet Caravan will always be my favourite song), due to the variety and Phil actually singing. So i had great anticipation for this album and bought it first day out.<BR>After the first listen I didn't know what to think, except it ended in style (Landing on the mountains of meggido is one of the best songs ever), as it probably too much of a mix; but a few listens got me realising just how good it is as a whole. Its hard to compare to NOLA, when NOLA had many good songs itself, but they certainly did the right thing for a followup.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Jean Reno made a right decision.I believe , this was his first movie in the US,and thank,s GOD,hi picked the right one!He was already a megastar in France(\\"Subway\\" was priceless),but he took this one , here.I watched this movie for at least 20 times in last couple of years,and every time it touches me (what is not easy).This is a story about professional hit man ,but he is a\\"good guy\\".This is a story about a dirty coup, a bad guy.But a little girl invited herself in, and everything made a point: we don,t know who is who. Do you want to know? Watch  \\"professional\\" and you will be surprise!!!
B0000639FE|5.0|Jerry Maguire is definatly a film that doesn't come along  very often. It is inspirational, humorous, and even romantic.  Tom Cruise really should have won an oscar for his performance. It blew me away! Out of a lot of the movies I have ever seen, this one made me smile and feel like crying at the same time. This movie proves that love is out there and that you can make your dreams happen. If you have never seen any of this movie, I strongly urge you to at least give this one a shot. You will not regret seeing this.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The first time i heard the wailing guitar solo on last nite had me intrigued. so i bought the album last september and it has not left my ear since. The entire cd from beginning to end keeps you wanting more. Starting the cd with the mellow rock of \\"is this it\\" preps you for the amazing lyrics of singer julian casablancas, throughout the rest of the lp. And finishes with the hard rock sound of \\"Take it or Leave It\\".  The Creme de la Creme of the album is the u.s. neglected \\"new york city cops\\". This cd recreates rock and puts the mainstream rap-rock (rack) to death ears.   All around \\"IS THIS IT\\" is it!

B00005JKBC|2.0|All you need to know about this movie (horribly overdirected as usual by the insecure Tony Scott) is that all the gyrations, life risking moves by so called ultraintelligent guys is as a result of one's love for a girl who seems to be a leftist terrorist sympathizer....in other words, this moview makes no sense.
B00003OSTN|5.0|MILDRED PIERCE is a classic film noir with exceptionally fine performances. Joan plays the title role with such dedicated conviction that you feel both angry and empathetic for her character: her daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) has got to be the most ungrateful daughter of all time! Crawford plays the valiant, hardworking, ambitious Mildred who eventually owns a chain of successful restaurants (with the help of a ne'er-do-well playboy by the name of Monte Berrigan (the unique Zachary Scott)...Jack Carson gives his usual unaffected performance as Wally and Eve Arden is a hoot as the very tall Ida, Mildred's cynical, no-nonsense friend who initially hired Mildred as a waitress against her better judgement - and, as a consolation prize, later works for Ms. Pierce...Classic line from Ida: \\"Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young\\". As the selfish, affected, mercenary Veda, Ann Blyth plays the teenage wench with such venomous sincerity that 1945 audiences were quite impressed with her performance. P.S. I find it rather amusing that a tune heard on the radio during a key love scene comes from a Bette Davis picture: IT CAN'T BE WRONG from NOW, VOYAGER; it's a kind of subtle reminder of their legendary feud! About a year and a half priorly, Crawford had left M-G-M and signed a Warners contract. Davis, the undisputed Queen of Warners, refused to do this film when the role of Mildred Pierce was offered her. Crawford won her long-awaited AA while Davis's career was rapidly faltering...
B00005TT77|4.0|People wonder why, if all the songs in the movie \\"i am sam\\" are by the Beatles, why not use the original Beatles recordings?  I think it is because the filmmakers were attempting to re-define the context of these songs.  The movie is about the love between a mentally retarded father and his normal daughter.  The film takes what were most times originally intended by Lennon and McCartney to be romantic love songs between a man and a woman and places them in the context of this father-daughter love, and in doing so show the faith the lead character Sam had in the truth of the music of the Beatles.  It also demonstrates the versatility of much of the Beatles collection.  By having new voices and interpretations of these Beatles classics, the filmmakers were also showing their own faith in the music.  A good example of this is the scene where they play \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" as performed by the Wallflowers (who do a great job).  In the scene, the daughter Lucy is at an age (six or seven) where she is beginning to realize that her father Sam is not normal.  You see it in her eyes as the music declares \\"...I'm looking through you, you're not the same.\\"  It is a very touching scene.<br />Not every recording is perfect:  Eddie Vedder's \\"Hide Your Love Away\\" is overrated and \\"Help\\" done by Howie Day is just boring.  But the rest are great, and I even like Ben Harper's \\"Strawberry Fields\\" better than the Beatles'.
0316666343|5.0|...of you that have not yet read this fantastic, insightful, heart-wrenching, wonderful novel - I would like to trade places with you and read it again, fresh. But this time I would read it slower; linger longer over passages; pause more often.  <br />I am jealous of you, but I don't envy you.  You will read the book. You will be touched.  You will love the justice of ice. But then you'll join my jealous world.
0312265859|1.0|I have read the first seven novels of Janet Evanovich and looked forward to Hard Eight.  I was very disappointed.  Her  characters lack any substance.  Grandma and Lula should be a comic book instead of a mystery.  It's as though Evanovich has suddenly become aware of her humor and the \\"joke\\" of her writing and now it is all just pretend.  I have stopped caring and believing.  Bad day in Blackrock and a loss of my [$$$].
0894803123|5.0|I have bought several ice cream books, but this is the ONLY one I can recommend. The recipes are EXCELLENT! I am ordering another since mine is already dog-eared and I've only had it a month. One suggestion if you make the orange cream recipe - use at least double the orange juice stated in the recipe (half a can of frozen concentrate - thawed, of course, and not the small size can). I just tasted the mix to make sure it was the strength I wanted. I've noticed that after this is made and frozen, it doesn't taste as strong as it did before you put it into the machine. I've made this particular recipe 3 times and will continue making it !! It beats any creamsicle you've ever had. And the French Vanilla and Mocha (and regular Coffee) are to die for! The mocha came out the texture of gelato - what a dream ! I haven't managed to try all the recipes yet, but the 10 or so I've tried have turned out perfectly. I am now making it once or twice a week for my co-workers because it is too good not to share! This book has also given me enough information to experiment with recipes of my own. I just can't say enough about this book. And as a previous reviewer states, there should be a sequel - if they are willing to give up more of their recipes. And I wish they would add a recipe for chocolate ice cream using only cocoa powder (I'm too lazy to melt the chocolate squares). Based on their recipes, I strongly recommend using a 1 and 1/2 quart capacity machine, rather than the 1 quart, since when mixes are frozen, they tend to expand due to \\"whipping\\" the cream. Air is beaten into the ice cream by the machine, causing the expansion. I noticed that many of the recipes indicate the yield is a \\"generous quart\\" and they are not kidding!
0767802624|2.0|This movie was funny, had action, and the DVD had great extras. Why only 2 stars? This movie is far too violent, and includes shots of a man's skin being torn off his body, two disuised aliens being sliced through the neck (and dying), a person having been killed and inprisoned in a slimy green cocoon, an alien jumping off a building to his death, a toe truck driver being shot and killed, several squashed cockroaches, a hose puring out toxic gas was shoved down a man's throat (obviously killing him), an alien being blown apart, a guy's head being shot<BR>off, and, to top it all off, a full shot of a man broken in half at the waist, lying dead with a pale face and his feet by his head, stuffed into a metal shelf, one arm hanging down at his side. I would not reccomend thhis film to anyone who can't stand blood and guts.
B000063S6Z|5.0|With all the... that's on the radio these days... it's great to have someone like Moby around, who actually knows what music is about.  \\"18\\" is a great collection of works that picks up where \\"Play\\" left off.  \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\" is the best song this year by far.  It's an uplifting and positive song... Moby will around making great music ten years from now...
B00000DI06|5.0|Why write another review when there are already so many?  Because The Rutter Requiem is one of the most beautiful pieces of modern sacred music composed, and the Cambridge Singers execute it with graceful, soaring perfection.  Rather than being about death, the Rutter Requiem is really composed for those left living.  It is comforting, melodic, and uplifting.<br />This recording is conducted by the composer, which makes it particularly interesting.  Rutter is one of the few composers who really conducts well.  He frames his modern and sometimes dissonant harmony with masterful phrasing.  The Cambridge Singers and London Sinfonia are responsive, and work together well.  Some reviewers have criticized Caroline Ashton's Pie Jesu, but I disagree.  The Pie Jesu movement of a requium is traditionally plantive, asking Christ's blessing, and Ashton's clear, light sound works quite well.  Perhaps my favorite movement is \\"The Lord is my Shepherd\\" with an exquisite oboe solo by Quentin Poole.<br />This recording is like sitting in church, listening to a particularly good choir and orchestra perform a beautiful work, and it is well worth buying.
B00003CXDB|3.0|I did like this movie. However, it is full of gross exaggerations and biases that we have come to expect from Stone. First of all, the little subtitle at the beginning says that the year is 1985. No more than 20 minutes into the film Bud Fox's partner, when speaking about Gekko, says that Gekko sold Nasa stock short after the Challenger blew up. The Challenger didn't explode until 1986. Plus, I didn't know that Nasa was listed on the NYSE!!<br />What works is Gekko's little 'Greed' speech. It's true. All humans are motivated by their self-interest. Why greed has such a bad connotation is puzzling. Gekko's other little diatribe toward the end of the film is pure [trash]. Life is not a zero-sum game. Just because you make more money, for example, doesn't mean that I will make less. If this is Stone's belief, which I'm sure it is, he's as dumb as a box of rocks.<br />One more thing, Bud and Gordon wore awesome suits! More men need to start wearing suspenders (braces) again!
0316776963|4.0|This was my first Sedaris book.  Needless to say, it won't be my last.  While there were a few stories that left me searching for the punchline, the majority of them were hilarious!  I haven't laughed this much since reading \\"Without Feathers\\" by Woody Allen.  I also enjoyed the diversity of the stories presented; it wasn't uncommon for a story about social inequality to be followed by one rife with toilet humor.  My advice--read this book!
0345413377|4.0|I read the first two books in Pullman's trilogy, \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" a while ago, and having to wait years for the final volume nearly drove me crazy. \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" was just as riveting as the first two. Pullman has a great style and is extremely inventive. The way he wove the revelations of the first two books into a cogent plot of \\"what's really going on\\" was ingenious. However, I didn't quite like the ending. I'm a fan of storybook endings where everybody's happy and this didn't - exactly - happen in this book. The way it plays out makes perfect sense, and I spent the last third of the book going, \\"oooooooh!\\" as the connections hit me, but some points of the ending irked me. I have heard rumors that Pullman plans a followup to the trilogy, and I await it eagerly.<br />In other words, if you read the first two books you of course should read this one to know how it ends - the engaging story is certainly worth your time. If you are considering reading the trilogy (which should unquestionably be read in order, or it makes no sense at all), proceed with caution. There are incredible but surprising ideas in all three books, and the ending is not to be expected. All in all though, it's a very good series.
6305669651|3.0|You know there are problems when the director of a film removes his name.  This was an ambitious film with great sets/costumes and actors. It also has a decent story.  The problems, however, started when Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione shot additional explicit porno scenes and placed them throughout the film. These scenes total disrupt the flow of the film. Without these additional scenes, the film is already filled with plenty of sex, but it is handled very well. If you can get your hands on a version of this film without the porno, then I highly recommend it. Otherwise, you'll have to deal with it.
B000067CPX|3.0|By The Way is a very pretty and emotionally uplifting record. But i already own Incubus Morning View. I was looking for a chilli fix but instead i got the Californication bsides, at least thats what it sounds like to me. Anthony Kiedis shows why he rapped all those years ago, he can't sing. AND FLEA were are the signature bass lines, non excistant. Disappointment enshrouds me as i say REST IN PEACE to a once great and influential band.
0671721720|5.0|David Weber has created Science fiction's equivalent of C.S. Forrestor's Horatio Hornblower saga with his ongoing saga of his heroine, Honor Harrington. With her faithful, and empathic, treecat Nimitz, this series is a true delight. This is swashbuckling, space opera sci-fi at its best, with excellent characters, a vibrant universe, complete with an intriguing socio-political plot which drives the overall plot of the background of this fascinating universe.<br />\\"The Honor of the Queen,\\" the 2nd novel in the Honor Harrington weries, takes place a couple of years after the events of \\"On Basilik Station.\\" Honor has command of the cruiser Fearless, an up-to-date modern heavy cruiser, and is given command of a small squadron of ships to take on a dilpomatic mission to the planet Grayson in the Yeltsin system. Honor's Star Kingdom of Manticore is seeking allies against the People's Republic of Haven (Peeps) which has been funding its welfare-state economy by conquering and looting worlds.<br />The good news for Honor is that the diplomatic mission is commanded by her mentor, Admiral Raoul Courvosier, detached from the Navy to the Foreign Office for this mission. The bad news: Grayson is a feudal planet, a planet founded by religious zealots, a planet where women don't even have the right to vote, and equality of the sexes is unheard of. to say nothing of the idea of women serving in the military. And no one's told the Graysons that the Manticoran commanding officer is a woman.<br />It's bad enough that Honor has to deal with sexism form the Graysons, but even worse, Grayson's long standing war with the far more extreme and repressive zealots who live on the planet Massada is heating up, dramatically. Even worse, the Peeps are attempting to take advantage of the situation.<br />This is a truly enjoyable novel, with a high fun factor. Mr. Weber does a nice job of portraying the conflicted nature of much of the Grayson high command, and he takes the relationship between Honor and Nimitz even further than before. Mr. Weber's chaacters are fascinating, and a number of characters introduced in this novel will be recurring characters throughout this series.

But Grayson is desperately short on experienced officers, and Captain Honor Harrington, Royal Manticoran Navy, on half-pay from that service due to the political fallout of her quest for justice, is offered the rank of a full admiral in the Grayson Navy.<br />This novel spends time looking into the nature of Grayson politics, and has Honor and her treecat Nimitz dealing with religious zealots who cannot abide by the thought of what Honor, a woman, is doing to their male-dominated traditions. In addition, the Peoples Republic of Haven (Peeps) is attempting a counter-offensive in their war with the Manticoran Alliance. This novel serves to help widen the Honor Harrington Universe with its examination of Grayson politics.<br />Honor and friends must battle terrorists who would slaughter innocents, rampaging sexist bigots, and the ever-present menance of the Peeps. This book contains a brief afterword by the author relating a certain tragic event in this novel with the bombing in Oklahoma City. That afterword, and this book's look at the minds of religious zealots prepared to do anything for their beliefs, remains sadly relevant after the events of 9/11.<br />This is an excellent and enjoyable novel.

B000066NW0|5.0|Well, for starters, I would like to say that I really do not think that Avril Lavigne should be categorized as pop like many have stated. For one thing, she writes her own songs. She can actually play an instrument. She isn't a manufactured puppet made up by the music company. Avril Lavigne deserves to be well known and popular, because she is a very talented song writer and a wonderful musician. This is one of the only cds I have heard lately that I don't feel the need to skip ahead on the track list. The whole thing is very well done, and if you are open minded at all, you should hear this cd. I will also add that unlike a few other female \\"musicians\\" Avril does not need to strip off all of her clothes to make herself popular (ahem, Britney Spears), because her music is actually good enough to take her somewhere.

0316666343|5.0|In my mind, there are three things that make a book stand shoulders above the reams of pages printed each day.  First is obviously the story; quite often the reader will forgive anything of a writer who creates a plot so gripping that we lose ourselves in the pages.  Second are the characters; even the most mundane part of life---say a woman drinking her coffee before she prepares for work---can keep the pages turning if the protagonist is unique and interesting.  Finally, there is the quality of writing; in great literature, it is often not what is said but how the story is told that makes the difference.  The remarkable thing about Alice Sebold's first novel is not that it manages to do one of these things splendidly, but rather that she somehow creates a story that does all three.  Told from a perspective that I have never before seen in modern literature, The Lovely Bones is a story that grips the imagination from page one and does not let go, even days after the novel has been finished.  Sebold's characters are so real, so alive, that they spring from the page fully formed.  The plot is one told with real emotion, and you cannot help but let the narrator's overwhelming sense of loneliness seep into your soul.  Above all else, the beauty of Ms. Sebold's writing dominates the work, and the transcendent character of her words is simply sublime.  The Lovely Bones is among the finest stories I have ever read.  Buy a first edition while you still can---and treasure it like a first printing of To Kill A Mockingbird.

B00005JLDW|4.0|... For one things, most of the criticism seemed to be along the lines of: 1) the dragons didn't meet their fantasy-genre expectations, or 2) there was not enough on-screen carnage. Since the good reviews seemed to focus on the opposite - that this is a movie about people facing dragons, not a \\"dragon movie,\\" it sounded worth the risk of a few hours. Surprisingly, for an action movie, this is a movie that made me care about the people involved, and in particular Christian Bale's character. What is left of humanity has its back against the wall, and two leaders with very different styles are presented. One of the things I appreciated is that the movie manages to side-step most action-movie cliches (although I did know one very likeable character was doomed). Choices are made, not always right, and there are no super-heroes, but there is heroism. There was never a moment when I wasn't emotionally involved, even though it remains a popcorn movie. If you go into this determined to pick apart the \\"what-ifs\\" or if you truly enjoy on-screen gore, you are going to be disappointed. If you want human drama in a fantasy scenario, then you might well enjoy it.

B00005OAIE|4.0|While I am a huge DMB fan, I must respectfully disagree with Rickey Wright's review. John Mayer is talent to be reckoned with. His lyrics are amazing, from the longing for his youth in &quot;83&quot; to the frustration of not being able to contain/help a girl in &quot;Neon&quot;. &quot;Your Body is A Wonderland&quot; also happens to be one of the most romantic songs in a few years. Any man who can write a song like that has major talent. Not only is he reminiscent of Dave Matthews, but there are also great similarities to early Sting. As an early John fan, I must also recommend &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;, a rare demo of his. There are early acoutic versions of &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Neon&quot;. His melodies are infectious, the lyrics are vivid and memorable, and I highly recommend &quot;Room for Squares&quot;.
B00004YKUY|2.0|The new Steve doesn't do the ballads as well as the old Steve.  Yes A couple of the songs do rock, but overall it is the weakest Journey album they have ever released.  I might add that I am not counting the original 3 which where great albums, but not comparable to the journey most people know.  Believe what you want, but it is also the poorest selling Journey album ever.
B000066C87|4.0|Altman's \\"Gosford Park\\" is a marvellous broad canvas that, in addition to providing a meticulously detailed view of genteel 1930's \\"upstairs-downstairs\\" living, touches on a variety of other deeper matters (the complex relationships between the gentry and the serving staff, the amusing mutual incomprehension between the British and Americans at the house, the intriguing system of control exerted by the patriarch over other members of the household...)<br />The plot revolves around a murder in a classic \\"the butler did it...\\" scenario. However, this melodramatic touch seems almost secondary to Altman's interest in the complex interplay of relationships. The \\"whodunnit\\" is ultimately resolved (if in a slightly unsatisfying way.) <br />In all, a wonderful lush (and wry) period piece. Enjoyable to watch, if occasionally confusing and involved. (There are many characters, many quietly spoken asides & a lot of subtle activities on screen -- a second viewing may be required to unravel the many intricacies.)

Her lover goes through another conflict too... though I found the religious/spiritual side ot if a little awkward for me!<br />I have to say that I felt that she should have called her lover by his name at least at that moment of new revelation just becasue she was telling the story and it would have showed her new self!<br />I enjoyed the climate and the atmosphere of the story .. the river... the Spanish countryside .. the rain and fog.. everything contributed to illustrate the picture of divine unspoken emotions .. memories of sweet love and a new look at life...<br />A beautiful romantic fantasy of reaching new horizons of the mind and soul..
B000068QY7|5.0|I am a huge fan of oasis, since '95. I love them. I have all there albums, and I can say Heathen Chemistry is one of their best. It has a lot of variety, pure rock n roll and some future classics like Stop Crying your heart out. I love that one. I also like the typical Oasis type song HINDU TIMES.<br /> I love the album even more because Liam contributes with three songs, being my favorite, SONGBIRD, its just pure romantic! He did improve from Little James to now! It looks like the 5 are getting along for the first time. Oasis is back in full swing! They are mature and into their music, and u can see it in this album.  I love LITTLE BY LITTLE, very cool. You can say it was Noel. And Liam can write, listen to BORN ON A DIFFERENT CLOUD! WOW! I am so excited cause Oasis is goin to make more albums and r not thinking of splittin any time soon!!!!! YESS. True Oasis Fans buy the record, you'll love it! And whoever wants to know what Oasis play, buy it, you hear it, then u love it and then u can't stop hearing it.  As a TRUE FAN, I LOVE THE ALBUM!!!!!! <br />What I expected from this album, IT WAS GOIN TO BE GREAT. Oasis always gives greatness! I can say this album goes in the group of the Definitely Maybe and Whats the story Morning Glory albums, for real it does!  <BR>Oasis u guys ROCK!  LIve Forever! I love u guys! u R THE REAL MATES! my favorite lyric of this album is from HINDU TIMES, it is \\"I GOT SPEED AND I WALK ON AIR\\" awesome!

B00003CXTF|5.0|I absolutely loved Pearl Harbor!  Everyone in this film did excellent, but I won't lie: I LOVE Josh Hartnett!  I think it was his best performance in a movie yet.  The friendship between Josh and Ben Affleck's characters really shows.  I liked the romance in the movie and the action sequences.  Normally, I really dislike war movies, but I definitely made an exception with Pearl Harbor.  It was one of the best movies I've ever seen.-
0380977788|5.0|Forty year old Englishman Neil Gaiman is the author of an impressive array of work, including \\"The Sandman\\" series of graphic novels. Also planned for the big screen, with Neil as screenwriter and possibly director, is my favorite \\"Death: The High Cost of Living.\\" (Every 100 years Death spends a day as a mortal) Add to his credits the novel \\"Good Omens,\\" co-written with Terry Pratchett, \\"Thief of Time,\\" will soon to be released as feature length film.<br />In  \\"Coraline\\" a bored girl passes through a portal in her home to a parallel world where people and things are much stranger, and in some ways much better.

It was difficult for me not to think this work was inspired by the story \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\" An Alice in Dangerland perhaps?     <br />In an interview Gaiman said, \\"The thing I find oddest about Coraline, is those people who, after reading it, tell me that it seemed really familiar.

Why, it's the 'blown opportunity' category!  True, Mr. McConaghey and Mr. Bale try hard to overcome the script that they've been given, but in the end they fail.  Another one who must ultimately succumb to the dreary material is Rob Bowman, who handled the X-FILES big screen outing to admirable effect.  Overall?  You can wait for the video.

B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural is considered by many Pearl Jam's worst record.  I can do nothing else but strongly disagree.  This record has always struck me as a wonderful collection of songs and a perfect mixture of each members' contribution to the supreme blend that is the almighty Pearl Jam.  (By the way, PJ is by far my favorite band).  The music in this album is incrediby diverse.  It sounds like subdued punk on the first three tracks and sound like mourful pop on the next three.  The other rock tracks on this album (Insignificance and Greivance) are of stark contrast to anything Pearl Jam has ever done before.  Insignificance is almost apocolyptic and has a great underlying sense of urgency.  Greivance is a dynamic shout-along track with political lyrics.  Of The Girl and Parting ways are both beautiful and quiet folk songs (the former a particularly excellent piece of restrained rock written by Stoney G -the man- with great leads by Mike McCready backing up the main acoustic riff).  Sleight of Hand is quite possibly the best on the album (up there with the mysterious and mournful Nothing As It Seems).  It has quiet quirky verses in some odd meter that crash like waves into the anthemic chorus with absolutely freaking wonderful vocals and lyrics by Eddie Vedder.  And who can't love the funny as hell ukelele track, Soon Forget?<br />This is an all encompassing record that doesn't get nearly the credit is deserves from other reviewers.  It's a great listen from beginning to end and if you are a Pearl Jam fan and don't own this, run to the nearest record store you silly ... and pick it up!  It is amazing.  Thank you for reading.<br />Dan
0743455967|4.0|King kills all the romantic crap about the writer's lifestyle and confirms what other writers have said before -- If you want to make it as a writer, you had better love it, because the ability to enjoy sitting in a windowless room blasting your braincells and eyeballs on at least 2,000 words day after day for the rest of your natural, is a privilege enjoyed by only a special few. <BR>If you're one of those, you'll soon know it, because you'll find yourself reading between 70 and 80 books a year, often at places like your mom's funeral, a date, or the five minutes of bliss in the waiting room before your tooth's pulled. If you don't relish the prospect - and King means REALLY RELISH IT, then writing's not for you. <BR>Another book I recently enjoyed on much the same topic is \\"The World Is My Home\\" by one of the most prolific writers of all time, James A Michener. He says pretty much the same thing. <BR>Incidentally, the only part of King's excellent book that grates is his use of \\"his/her\\", his/herself\\" and \\"he/she\\". While I'm sure many in our modern democracy empathise with the noble sentiment, CAN WE PLEASE AGREE ON A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. Even invent one, for chrissakes!

0811826848|4.0|I liked the format of this book, the way it tells it in their own words helps represent all of the <BR>Beatles pretty equally (except John, for whom archive interviews are used). I do like the way the different perspectives come together to give you a fuller idea of the story, rather than just a one-sided view. If you're a beatles fan, you'll get something out of this (unless you've read every other Beatles book out there) A couple points about the book I'd like to comment on.<br />1) the book itelf is too damn big, making it annoying to handle/read.<br />2) Hey, sure, John Lennon was a genius, but I could do without him going on and on (and on) about how bad it was being in the Beatles, how he felt &quot;trapped&quot;, etc. No offense, but I never fully bought this; I doubt he would have given it up for anything and beleive he rather liked being in the Beatles as it let him place himself above people.<BR>...And on that note I don't really think Lennon had much of a right to complain about how his father leaving him at an early age had such a negative effect on him, especially when he went and ditched his first wife Cynthia for Yoko Ono and barely ever spoke to his son Julian after that!<br />3) Did you know that every idea the Beatles ever had came from Paul Mcartney? Neither did I, until I read this book. To hear him tell it, he even wrote most of John's songs (only the good ones, though).
0316666343|2.0|What a ridiculous premise.

B000058T5E|4.0|Thirty Five years after starting out in the music scene, Jeff Beck proves he's still a talent with the release of You Had It Comming. The guitar solos on here are indeed quite mesmerizing and fairly memorable. I would have prefered a little more instrumental defintion as exhibited on Blow By Blow. Even though the techno drum machine beats do work for the most part, there is nothing quite like having a real drummer.<br />Outside of those little complaints, this is a very good recording. All of the songs are pretty catchy with Nadia, Rollin' and Tumblin, and Suspension being the stand out pieces.
B000067CPX|5.0|The chili peppers do it once more with \\"by the way\\".  They have reinvented alternative music once again. And they prove that they don't have to revert back to the funk of old in order to make a great album.  I've read too many negative reviews from \\"fans\\" that complain of how they've \\"sold out\\" or \\"burned out\\", and the only reply I can think of is, \\"you are only fairweather fans\\".  I can not believe i've read the words \\"sold out\\" within a review from a fan of this group. The way I see it is, if the peppers would've done what most \\"fans\\" wanted them to do, which is make another \\"blood sugar sex magic\\" they would've been going along with the popular opinion.  That is also known as \\"selling out\\".  They didn't though, they made the album they wanted to make. They didn't create this beautiful batch of songs to make as much money as possible or to please their die hard fans, they made it because that is who they are now.  They aren't the same youths from the early nineties who spit \\"mother's milk\\" into the mix and [messed] us up with \\"bssm\\", they are who they are and if you don't like it they could probably care less.
0783221487|3.0|Set in the distant future in which mankind is spread across space and interstellar trade and travel depends upon huge spaceships navigated by mutated humans called navigators.  Computers and other thinking machines are outlawed - a consequence of an earlier age of cybernetic oppression over mankind that came to an end with the \\"Butlerian Jihad\\".  Instead, computerized men called \\"mentats\\" do the heavy thinking.  Underlying every aspect of civilization is the spice \\"melange\\".  Melange extends human life-spans and is also the base for the mentats' sappho juice.  In larger quantities, melange alters the consciousness, allowing its users to read minds and see through walls of time and space.  For the navigators, constant spice consumption is essential.  The inhospitable desert world of Dune is the only source of the stuff.  Monster worms swallow whole huge harvesters that pick the spice off the sand, while storms powerful enough to strip a man to the bone keep much of the planet veiled in mystery.  Fremen natives of the planet are hostile to outsiders, but keep to themselves and their \\"zensunni\\" ways.  The economy, tied to spice harvesting, keeps anybody from wielding complete power whether openly or in secret.  The emperor's power is eroded by his dependence on the spacing guild but also by the constant plotting of both the Bene Gesserit and between the warring houses of the Landsraad.  The BG are an order of women addicted to spice but also devoted to eugenics.  While others seek to rule the universe by plotting over spice, the BG have spent centuries breeding a super-being called the \\"Kwisatz Haderach\\" through whom they will rule the universe.  Unsurprisingly, the navigators will have none of this, and plot with Emperor to kill the likely candidate for BG's purposes.  Luckily for them both, the candidate is Paul Atreides, the heir to the noble House Atreides, and already a target.  Politics has forced the Emperor to secretly plot intervening on behalf of the Atreides's hated enemy, House Harkonnen.  Knowing of the plotting, but not its details, the Atreides obey the Emperor and move their Duchy to Dune.  The headstrong Duke believes that the best way to defeat a trap is to stick your head into it.  With his wise and BG-trained concubine, Jessica, his preternaturally brilliant son Paul, the age-old mentat-assassin Thufir, the fighting minstrel Gurney Halleck, the chief Administrator Duncan Idaho and his army, The Duke feels himself besieged but invulnerable.  The Duke is especially confident because of his philosophy of unlocking the hidden power of planets - sea-power on Caladan, and for Dune - desert power.  He seeks the fremen, convinced that they are the key.  Jessica, using her BG training, finds the Fremen religion rooted on hopes of a messianic warrior who will lead them in a holy war.  However, not even the Duke is prepared for the treachery that delivers him into the hands of the hated Baron Harkonnen.  When the Duke falls, Jessica and Paul flee to the Fremen, now desperate to exploit the Fremen fanaticism for their survival.  Thought dead by the Imperium, and through the Fremen chief, Stilgar, Jessica becomes their chief BG, while Paul becomes their general, adopting the name \\"Muadib\\".  Under his command, Harkonnen forces are annihilated and the emperor is forced to come to Dune himself with all of his legions of Sardaukar troops, where he will discover the secret identity of Muadib, and all will reap the disastrous consequences of their plotting.<br />This movie was reviled when released, looking like a cross between \\"The Ten Commandments\\" and \\"Eraserhead\\".  Given the more coherent but also more uninspired version produced for the Sci-Fi channel, this version is due for a fresh take.  The casting is excellent, but the script just seems hokey, like some nightmare biblical epic.  Lynch wavers between following his source material closely and venturing beyond it.  (The Emperor's plot against the Duke was a plot idea cooked up for the film that doesn't make sense - the Emperor has little true power for which the Atreides would contend, and anyway, Atreides are too busy warring with Harkonnen.  The Emperor mostly laments the forces that have forced him to turn against the Duke; the Fremen would never have discarded their prized \\"crysknives\\" for weirding modules) The visuals are also frustrating - with harvesters and carry-alls looking only like elaborate models, and some settings looking little more than concept drawings.  The battle scenes are weak - mobs of soldiers running across the sand with guns - but then battles never occur in the books, all being described after the fact.  The greatest challenge is dealing with the subtext - which Lynch presents by having his actors recite their deep thoughts in whispering voice overs.  Adapting Dune is something of a Catch-22 - the more coherent it is, the less it is the Dune that Herbert fans have loved for decades.  The guys who wrote the Dune prequel books had no problem choosing which course they favored, which made \\"House Atreides\\" both a cogent story and correspondingly trite.  The result is a messy compromise for the director who wasn't sure whether he should follow of simply write his own epic (my vote: he should have tried going his own way - his opening scene, one not occurring in the book, where the emperor faces a navigator - is priceless).  Look for Lynch in a cameo as a spice harvester, and also Lynch fixture, the late Jack Nance (\\"Eraserhead\\" and the guy who first found Laura Palmer wrapped in plastic) as Nefud, the Baron's closest guard.  But pay special attention to Brad Dourif as Piter, the baddest of mentats - his litany of mind over matter is the catchiest thing in this flick.

B00004LN16|5.0|This is one of the best albums the band has ever made, and can serve as good reference material for what make them what they are.  AC/DC are, hands down, no questions asked, the greatest hard rock band of all time.  Their influence is immeasurable (tribute albums alone range from techno to death metal to bluegrass) and they are an absolute corner stone of rock music.  Just finally getting around to getting some of the respect they deserve by 'the powers that be' they couldn't have released this album at a better time.  The drought that was the 5 years since ballbreaker was tough for 'dc fans, but they gave us exactly what we wanted when they finally stepped up to the microphone.  Stiff Upper Lip is the best album since the fan favorite 'Flick of The Switch', and it earns its place as one of the must have AC/DC albums every step of the way.  Highlights for me include Can't Stand Still, Satellite Blues, Safe in NYC, and the defiant Can't Stop Rock n Roll.  In short, the entire album is a battle cry against today's so called music.  Get it now :)

B00003CX9E|5.0|If you are educated and/or intelligent (they are not mutually exclusive you know), have an appreciation for film and film history and can appreciate something on its own as well as within the context of its time, then this is one of the greatest movies of all time.  <br />Imagine someone making a movie today that interprets the life and ego of Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner or even Bill Gates - chances are it would be cliche ridden and include midget actor Tom Cruise exercising all three of his acting personas. If it had a Rosebud, it would fully explain it (maybe even add a bland Elton John song to enhance the meaning) in some trite way that would deny intelligent viewers (who understand there isn't always an answer for everything) the chance to just revisit their own life's Rosebuds over and over.<br />If you still don't get it after viewing Ebert's commentary, you  really need to read a book now and again.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This album is a classic, containing some of Mingus' best known compositions. Good By Pork Pie Hat is a deeply felt tribute to Lester Young, Better Get It In Your Soul raises the roof like a gospel revival meeting. Fables of Faubus is quirky and menacing. <br />The band is full of good hard bop players. While not as adventurous as Mingus' bands from the 60s and 70s they play with style and passion. Horace Parlan in a wonder, especially considering that he worked with only three fingers on his right hand. <br />A must have for any jazz fan.
B0000640VO|1.0|Usually when people think pompous movies they think of some rehash of a rehash of a Ingmar Bergman movie that slugs its way through the college film school circuit.  Low angles, black and white, abstract, etc.  (Hold on, I'm getting to my point) And what separates this stuff from the masters?  These young turks confuse their childish self-obsession with actually meaning something.<br />Of course anyone with a brain knows when they see a good piece of film and when they see a bunch of second rate irony in clove cigarette smoke.<br />But then what if these same people decided to say &quot;Wait!  Let's make something sooo precocious it'll make your eyes water!&quot;  And that is what Jeunet did with Amelie.  Now I'm a huge fan of his work up until this point:  Delicatessen was excellent, so was City of Lost Children.  Geez, I even like Aliens Ressurection (try to find five other people who do)!  <br />But I can't bring myself to like Amelie because it is so self-aware of its own cuteness.  You can almost hear them behind the camera giving each other high fives on how they saccharin this film is.  The entire point of Amelie's life seems to be &quot;I know people are watching me, and I know they know I know they are watching so watch how cute and adorable I can bat my big puppy dog eyes!&quot;<br />Usually this happens with children actors in movies.  Sometimes you have the Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense: endearing because of his unmanufactured charm.  Sometimes you get the Haley Joel Osment of Pay it Forward: nauseating because of everyone trying to cash in on his brand name.  It is the difference between a hand written valentine and something from Hallmark.<br />Delicatessen had it.  So did City of Lost Children.  Amelie doesn't.  See the first two.  Skip the last.
B000066NW0|5.0|At first when I heard the song on the radio, I thought it was good. But then I started hearing &quot;Complicated&quot; over and over again, and I don't know why but the song became better and better each time I would listen to it. So, I finaly bought her cd &quot;Let Go&quot;. When I heard the whole album I was amazed, and I wanted to know more about Avril. So I went on her website to see her biography, and when I read that she was 17 years old and that she was from Canada, I was shocked. I would of never imagine that Avril would have made it sooo far, but she did and I'm very happy for her. I just want to say that her album is excellant and everyone should buy it. She has an amzing voice and she's very special (in her own way).
B00005T7HG|5.0|I had always wanted to see Evita perfomed on stage because my aunt used to sing Don't Cry For me Argintina for me when I could not sleep.  So it became my favorite song.  When I learned when I was older it was from a musical I wanted to see it.  The only problem is in Sacramento there is not many theater's capable of perfoming Evita.  When I heard the movie came out I rented it and fell in love with it.  I thought it had wonderful music and the story line intriged me.  I bought the video a little while back and I think it is awesome.  I might have felt differently, though if I would have seen it in theater first.  I think Andrew Lloyd Webber makes great music.  From what I have seen the &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; is a better musical but Evita is incredible and unforgetable in its own right.
0688170528|4.0|The Hartes and the Golds are inseparable and have been for 18 years.  Their children, Chris and Emily, have been entwined since babyhood.  Under the parents' fond and loving eyes, the two develop into best friends and on to romance as they reach their teens. The children are so close they have a private language and can finish one another's thoughts.<br />Does this sound like trouble waiting to happen?  Indeed it is.  Julie is under claustrophobic pressure that she doesn't understand, and in despair, wants to commit suicide and have Chris help her.  When the police find the pair, Julie is dead and Chris has a head wound and is unconscious.  Suicide pact gone wrong?  Murder?  We don't know.<br />The story is told in two voices \\"Then\\" and \\"Now.\\"  We learn about the childhood, friendships and daily lives of these upscale New Hampshire neighbors.  With the tragedy, the friendship shatters, the marriages are strained to the breaking point, and Chris is arrested for murder.  <br />A well-written tale with a few wrinkles that lift it out of the ordinary:  Chris's defense lawyer is about as far from a father figure as you can get.  He is interested in getting Chris off and his fee.  He has no interest whatsoever in what really happened, thus closing another door in the boy's face at this terrible time.  My sympathies were with Chris throughout, partly because he was the best-realized figure and partly because he was suffering for all the sins he didn't commit, even if in fact, he pulled the trigger that killed Emily.  I stayed irritated at the four parents because I could not believe they would not even notice the deadly \\"fusion\\" that was growing between their two children and what implications this melding of characters meant.<br />This is a good read and the suspense builds nicely until you are totally focused on figuring out what actually occurred the last few minutes of Emily's life.  You know why, but not who.
B00000G3BX|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie time and time again.  The story is so good and the voices are wonderful.  It is just a great charming movie all the way through and I love it.  I would say it is one of the best anamated movies in a while.
B00003CXRP|5.0|The moneymen must have been biting their fingernails over this one.  They know Tom Hanks can carry a movie, but can Tom Hanks BE the movie? I'd say the answer is \\"yes,\\" in a quiet sort of way.<br />Chuck Noland (TH) is a fast-talking, time-obsessed workaholic with just enough charm to keep him from being totally obnoxious.  He has a big job, probably as an industrial engineer in time management for FedEx, which is ironically omnipresent throughout the movie.  Chuck barely has time to court the lovely Helen Hunt (her talents totally wasted in this vapid role).  He exchanges Christmas presents with her in the car at the airport before he takes off on his fateful voyage.<br />The plane crashes into the sea near an atoll/island.  The crash is frighteningly horrific and terrifying.  All hands are lost except Chuck who is thrown free of the wreckage and driving propellers, and he struggles onto shore.  Up until this time, the movie is full of movement, sound, voices and has a rather brittle frenetic feel.  Now all is silence.  Chuck slowly gets his bearings and we are shown scenes of him trying to cope with his new situation.  FedEx cargo has washed ashore with him, and he opens boxes containing ice skates, a courtier gown and a volley ball that he names \\"Wilson\\" after its maker.  He is clumsy and has accidents, but we cannot help but admire his perseverance.  After grueling attempts, he finally gets a fire started and dances around it in pure Tarzan style congratulating himself to the heavens above.  A pause---and it is four years later.  The audience gasps \\"Four years!\\"  The physical changes in Chuck are astounding.  From an open-faced, slightly pudgy all-American boy, he has been transformed into a gaunt, sinewy, bearded predator with wary shifting eyes.<br />With great bravery he opts to try and find civilization rather than either suicide or living out his days alone.  He painstakingly builds a raft and turns his back on the only safety he has known for four years.After great suffering and privitation, he is rescued and flung back into civilization.<br />He reunites with his now-married girlfriend who announces he \\"is the love of her life.\\"  Does she realize the man standing before her is an entirely different person than the one who left her?  Maybe.  She goes unwillingly back to her family.  Chuck is clearly uncomfortable in almost all social situations and drives to the desolate west, stopping at a crossroads wondering what direction to take.<br />Tom Hanks is marvelous in his role. (It seems I forever say the same thing, because he is always \\"marvelous in his role.\\")  The film could have cut out maybe twenty minutes and not suffered a loss.  What is amazing is how he keeps your total attention and interest whether he is building a raft or talking to a volleyball.
080013558X|2.0|I saw the 1999 Annie version by Disney before this one.  I loved that one a lot.  This one just seems to be charmless.  I still love the story, but this movie did not seem to good.  It was slow and at times very dull.  Only some of the singing was good.  Nothing amazing and crisp like in an Annie play on stage.  The Annie verson from 1999 was a ton better.  Everyone looked a little more civilized and they brought the song Tommarrow back and made it Annie's song again.  In this version it is thrown in the back of things and does not make it her signature song.  I would not recommand this version, but if you want to see a great version buy the 1999 one.
B00005NTN5|3.0|When everyone thinks of this movie they think of the steamy lesbian scene, well it its only a minute or so, and before you know it you have to sit through another hours worth of a movie you just got to see chicks kiss. But don't worry, the storyline is half way exciting so don't fret!
6305265488|5.0|This movie is so great.  I have always loved the Cinderella story and this one is just a better version.  I loved how one sister was a good sister and how Danielle and the Prince met more than once before the ball.  It was such a charming and funny movie all at once.  It is also great for the whole family.  It is one of the best movies I have ever saw!!!
0783225970|5.0|Pacino at his very best. I think every American has seen this movie so there is no need to write a review on it. This must be placed in every DVD collection no matter what kind of <BR>movie-genre you like. The last half-hour is the best piece of cinema i think i will ever see.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|-Nicole Kidman sizzles as Satine, the dazling star of a popular french nightclub that caters to society's decadent elite. At the height of her sexual power, the stunning courtesan ignites the inner most desires of all the men who come in contact with her. She unwittingly draws Christian, a struggling writer portrayed by Ewan McGregor into her seductive spell. Their steamy affair sparks scandal and explosive onsequences. Visionary director, Baz Luhrmann's story of passion, obsession and desire fills the screen with high energy music and stunninig visuals.-<br />  Baz Luhrman did a a very great job on directing and how the story flows was really fit watching. Marius DeVries did the best music they could with the choreography of John O'Connel. With all these combinations, you'll never regret watching this movie and you would even repeat the movie one more time!
0385503954|5.0|Not a whole lot of action, and the mystery is fairly easy to figure out, but the point of the whole book is the beauty of the writing style and the intricate development of the characters. A wonderful, wonderful read.
0064407667|4.0|I rate this book just a four. I could say it's a good story but Lemony Snicket says that its a miserable and bad story but I say its not. This book has a story of hope with the Baudelaire siblings looking for a new family to belong. In this story they were brought to a distant relative of theirs, the count olaf, that mistreated them and didn't treated the as family but more of a servant. It would really be great if you get a chance to read one of it's series!
B00003CY6M|2.0|John Cusack is one of my all-time favorite actors, and clearly a smart person, too--I can't think of another bad film he's done. And Kate Beckinsale is reliably interesting, as well as beautiful. So I can't figure out how they wound up in this half-hearted loser of a movie. In addition to numerous irritating implausibilities (starting with Cusack not knowing the definition of \\"serendipity\\"), the main characters have no, well, characteristics, beyond their obsession with each other. Cusack ultimately treats the woman in his life horribly, but we're supposed to forgive him because he does it all for true love. Yuck. It's a shame, because this promised to be the kind of fluffy New York love story we all needed this past year. It seems as if either the movie got edited to death after production, or the writer just didn't care enough to make the story interesting in the first place--I can't tell which. <br />In any case, \\"Serendipity\\" turns out to be a sad waste of time and talent. If you're a Cusack fan, get \\"Say Anything,\\"  \\"High Fidelity,\\" \\"The Grifters,\\" or even \\"Grosse Pointe Blank.\\" If Beckinsale's the one you want to watch, try \\"Haunted,\\" \\"Cold Comfort Farm,\\" \\"Last Days of Disco,\\" or even \\"Brokedown Palace.\\"
0316666343|5.0|I could not put this beautiful book down. I told my friends the best way to describe my experience with 'The Lovely Bones' is that I read it while I waited for lights to change, I read it whenever I waited in line, I read it when I only had 15 seconds to spare. It is absolutely mesmerizing. I feel like my words cannot possibly do it justice...read this book.
B0000640VN|3.0|This movie had its moments, most of them provided by the yummy Hugh Jackman. And Liev Schreiber is very funny.  But it suffers from a bad case of Meg Ryan wrinkling up her adorable little nose and sighing at her hellish, though expensive, life. <br />It's also one of these new movies that specializes in insulting the intelligence of its audience. An example: the \\"villain\\" (a confused character played by Bradley Whitford--he's supposed to be bad, but I'm pretty sure he's not supposed to be an idiot) gets caught lying about an opera he hasn't really seen. Here's the thing: Many, many people in New York City (not just incredibly rich ones) love opera. If you don't know the plot of an opera, there's no point in lying about it, because the chances of getting caught are very high. But, apparently, the people who made this movie believe that the potential audience of this movie thinks that opera is only ever watched by upper-class snobs. And of course, in the end, true love conquers all, which in this case means the woman gives up everything she's worked for all her life, not to mention all her family and friends, to be with her man.<br />I can't say I didn't enjoy watching this movie. But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more insulted I felt by it.
6305069611|2.0|It seems that on a technologically advanced planet in another solar system, having a drought means all the buildings disappear and you're left with nothing for miles around except a mud hut. Then despite having less resources than an Ethopian desert dweller, you suddenly get in your low tech, driven-by-sail mud hut and trundle off to build a sophisticated spaceship which will then blast off to another planet. Or maybe you post your body via the 'transference of energy' as mentioned later in the film. In which case, why not take your family and aunty Flo with you? Yes, folks, we're back in the land of bonehead film making.<BR>At various points throughout this 'startling' opus, David Bowie continually stops to raise his nose and give a protracted sniff. The audience is aware of a similar smell throughout the duration of this pretentious stinker directed by Nicolas Roeg, a man forever failing to interest us in his pictures despite the head start of unusual subject matter. Bowie constantly gurns,  most risibly before whacking some cookies off an oven plate in what passes for him as a petulant sulk. The funniest moment occurs when Bowie screams \\"get out of my mind, all of you\\" to a wall of television sets. Look, just get out of the chair and pull the plug, son. The title of the picture says you're 'The Man Who Fell To Earth'. It didn't mention anything about breaking your legs as well. I guess it was meant to be 'way existential' or something.<BR>Elsewhere there is a great deal of nookie going on. Strangely, couples have a tendency to start rolling on the floor and screaming 'till their lungs burst, and all this before they actually climb into bed and have sex. Don't ask me why, it's the Seventies.<BR>Roeg obfuscates further with disappearing cars and an alien who talks in his sleep with someone whose standing clear the other side of a lake. A former cinematographer, his prime interest seems to be in producing a number of groovy images for a coffee table book rather thana coherent movie for the public.<BR>Bowie, failing to make us love the alien in this particular instance, informs us (less than portentously, to be fair) that 'everything begins and ends in infinity'. Viewers unfortunate enough to encounter this laboured film will have no trouble getting to grips with this concept.
9626341203|4.0|This Naxos abridgement of the 800+ page Thackeray novel stretches across five CDs, and one of my frequent thoughts while listening to Jane Lapotaire's excellent reading was &quot;Thank goodness they didn't transcribe the full novel&quot;.<br />To the modern ear, used to today's &quot;Show -- don't tell&quot; scriptwriter dictum, there is far, far too much exposition and far too few scenes in Thackeray's classic.  Thackeray can certainly do scenes of real drama -- witness the moment in which Rawdon catches Becky with her lover and the ensuing combat.  But for most of the reading we seem to be in catch-up mode, forever being told things that have happened off-camera.<br />Much credit to Jane Lapotaire for a fine reading of this work.  Her French accent is, as one might anticipate from someone with her surname, very good.  Although Becky is her tour-de-force, Lapotaire does well to bring the male characters alive, often with a certain hoarseness!<br />I have seen at least two TV serialisations of this novel, both by the BBC, and neither seemed quite as comprehensive an account of this long, winding tale at this Naxos abridgement.
B00002Z88D|1.0|So many others worked hard to create a subtle blend of hard metal riffs and smooth classical sounds over the years. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" demonstrates that Metallica too had been inspired and mixed classical guitar to COMPLIMENT songs like \\"Fade to Black.\\" Now, they have pathetically used every single orchestral sound they could get and have successfully OVERWHELMED and drowned out their songs. Truly a sickening and twisted sound that will make you cover your ears! What's worse is that they are so full of themselves that they now try to force people to belive that they are the originators of this concept.<br />Furthermore, it seems metallica has sold out in more than one way. Has anyone noticed how \\"girly\\" and weak James' voice sounds on this CD? Hmmnnnn... I wonder...
B000068QY7|2.0|I'm an admirer of Oasis. I've always thought the band had a lot of nerve to take the approach they do in promoting itself. Noel and Liam have claimed and continue to claim in some way that they are the best rock band ever. <BR>As absurd as it might sound, I think at certain points in their career they've achieved that status. And no I'm not kidding. The first Oasis album is a gem. The lyrics were vital. The song-writing genius. And it definitely had a lot more balls than the Beatles or the Jam or another band Oasis had been compared to.<BR>Morning Glory was really more of the same... just with a bit less rocking sound, which made them more accessable to an American audience. Not bad, but certainly a compromise.<BR>Be Here Now wasn't my cup of tea. But, it had a few stand out tracks on it. Way too overproduced. And the lyrical content slipped tremendously.<BR>Now, a lot of people are going to sit back and lob a lot of insults at Standing. I think it's a much stronger album than Be Here Now or Morning Glory.<BR>It's the Gallagher brothers looking inside a little more at their flawed condition and it comes off a lot more genuine than any of these b.s. pychadelic party anthems offered on &quot;Heathen.&quot; Standing was a mature effort. &quot;Heathen&quot; is immature and ungenuine. <BR>I listened to this album three times in the days since I've bought it. Absolutely nothing stands out. <BR>If the English are going to cry about how their record sales are slipping in America, well it better start coming up with a better product to push.
B000002MTR|5.0|If you know the history of the Red Hot Chili Peppers you'll definately agree the 'One Hot Minute' period was their hardest. Not that they had only lost John Frusciante to heroin, they also had to fulfil people's expectations that came up after the classic 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'. Therefor they needed an excellent guitarist and Dave Navarro was the perfect choice.<br />In some interview Flea said they had the 3rd creative climax of their career at that time. After having listened to 'One Hot Minute', you'll just agree with him. This album is as amazing as the Peppers' latest 'By The Way' with the only difference that 'OHM' really kicks...- I guess that's exactly what many RHCP fans miss on 'By The Way'.<br />The album starts with a heavy metal guitar riff on 'Warped'- there it is, Navarro's influence. This song is great though the vocals seem confusing the first time you hear it. 'Aeroplane' is a classic RHCP hit, Flea at his finest. Another great example of the RHCP power is 'Coffee Shop', here's the evidence that the cooperation Flea-Navarro is just as good as Flea-Frusciante or Flea-Slovak. 'Pea' is a song you may consider as ridicolous but to me it's pure fun, actually it's the best song to cover if you aren't a great vocalist.<BR>The energy of 'One Big Mob' hits your face in the beginning but it turns into a downtempo trip just to suddenly hit your face once again in the end.. You can't deny Led Zeppelin's influence on this one, remember 'Dazed and Confused'. 'Walkabout' is the only chill-out track on 'One Hot Minute'. <BR>I think I should mention another important fact that makes this CD so brilliant- it's Dave Navarro's guitar playing. He sounds very different from John Frusciante but that's exactly what music fans expect: a band exploring different musical landscapes. I guess that's the good thing about Red Hot Chili Peppers having tried so many different guitarists- it makes each album of them unique and fresh. Navarro plays like hell on 'Shallow Be Thy Game' and 'Falling Into Grace'. He showed us his genius on 'One Hot Minute' and in my opinion, many fans underappreciate his work with RHCP.<BR>You can't overlook Chad's excellent drumming and Anthony's as good as ever. This album feels like each of the four musicians showing off their abilities. Highly recommended.

0451169514|5.0|i just finished the book about an hour ago. Ill be honest when i say i don't read usually if i dont have to. I picked up this book on May 28, 2002 (ironically enough that's the same day that the events of the book start, on May 28th of 1985), and just finished. I have never read anything so realistic in my life. I'm actually kind of sad to be done with it. I want MORE...how about IT part 2??  The book was terrifying, but there was more to it then that. It focused on friendships, and childhood. I'm 19 and it left me wishing that i had friends like the ones in this book. I actually remember watching the made for television movie back when it was on. I would have been about seven, and it scared the crap out of me. I watched it again recently, and i've decided that the movie has got to be the worst screen play adaption of any novel ever. Too many parts were left out (mostly im sure because it was \\"made for TV\\"). But for those of you that have seen the movie and are afraid that it will ruin the book, have no fear. The book has lots more action, and events that you never heard about in the movie. I will reccommend this book to any close friend or relative i have. Do not let the size of the book intimidate you....it's FAST reading. I miss the book already, maybe ill read it again in a few years.
B00000JZIK|5.0|Put together a group of crooks, a $91 million heist, some twists and turns, and a mysterious crime lord called Keyser Soze, and you've got The Usual Suspects. Yes, the title does come from Casablanca. A customs agent Kujan (Palminteri) tries to get information about a crime from con man \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Spacey). There's a burning tanker in the San Pedro harbor, twenty-seven dead bodies, and four other temperamental criminals involved: former cop Keaton (Byrne), explosives expert Hockney (Pollak), and the hot-headed duo McManus (Baldwin) and Fenster (Del Toro).<br />The Usual Suspects could have gotten by on the storyline itself, but the script is funny and well-written and the acting is terrific all around, especially by Spacey and Del Toro (both in award-winning performances). So what are you waiting for? Add it to your video/DVD library. Now!
B00004ZD69|4.0|This is Godspeed and their predictable best.  So amazing, so powerful.  In my humble opinion, they don't need to waste all the time they waste getting to the climaxes which are the only reason I listen, and I'm sure everyone agrees.  But they are to inept to go from climax to climax with out crescendos, and some of the crescendos are pretty amazing anyway, so good job GYBE!
B000002KE2|4.0|This was the last of the truly great albums Black Sabbath ever recorded.  Sure, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" had a few songs (title track, \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\") that were actually very good, but it just didn't rock like their first four albums did.  Anyway, while it certainly isn't \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Vol. 4\\" is absolutely worth the money for anybody that professes to be a metalhead.  The tracks:<br />Wheels of Confusion - personally, I think the first couple minutes are very dull. But the band rewards you at the end of the song with an extended guitar solo at the end that just rocks.  Good stuff.<br />\\"Tomorrow's Dream\\" - traditional Sabbath song, catchy riff, you know what to expect<br />\\"Changes\\" - I'd like to know what the people who like this song are smoking.  This song is [crud].  Period.  Sample lyrics:<BR>\\"I feel unhappy / I feel sad / I lost the best friend I ever had / She was my woman / I love her so / But it's too late now / I've let her go\\".<BR>COME ON, people.  That's not a \\"classic ballad.\\"  Even Britney Spears can write better lyrics than that, and she hardly writes anything at all! This costs the album two stars (the last track makes up for one).<br />\\"FX\\" - It's just a filler track, but it's a pretty cool filler track.  Just a bunch of weird noises.<br />\\"Supernaut\\" - Again, traditional Sabbath song. And that's hardly a bad thing. This song rocks.<br />\\"Snowblind\\" - Excellent song about cocaine abuse.  It's not \\"Hand of Doom,\\" but it's not supposed to be.  In place of a spooky bass riff, it has an excellent guitar riff in the middle that sends a chill down your spine.<br />\\"Cornucopia\\" - Slow, pounding rocker. Who cares what it's about? Funky drum work as well.<br />\\"Laguna Sunrise\\" - another one of Tony Iommi's experimental acoustic songs. While it's an unexpected change of pace from the rest of the album, it's interesting. I just think Iommi should have saved all his short instrumental songs (this, \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\" from \\"Master of Reality\\"; \\"Fluff\\" from \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\") and put them on a solo album to make room for more rockers on the Sabbath albums.<br />\\"St. Vitus' Dance\\" - short 2-1/2-minute filler.  Not awful, not great.<br />\\"Under the Sun\\" - fabulous song.  This beats every track on \\"Master of Reality\\" and all but three off of \\"Paranoid\\". [Wicked] guitar, mad bass, incredible drums, and classic Ozzy vocals. The ending sequence is simply amazing - their second-best after (of course) the end of \\"War Pigs\\" from \\"Paranoid.\\"  This song alone merits the album an extra star.<br />Overall, it's a good album. I might grow to like this more, but I can only give it four stars now. (I rated \\"Paranoid\\" at four stars, but in retrospect, I should have given it five) While it falls behind their previous two albums, it's about as good as the first and much better than anything they did afterwards. If you're new to Black Sabbath, I'd start with either \\"Paranoid\\" or their debut, but if not, you have to get it.  If \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" is an essential, then you absolutely must get this album to have any kind of respectable Black Sabbath collection.
B000067CPX|1.0|Rarely in my music purchases does a CD get listened to once and get placed immediately in the &quot;Sell to used record store&quot; pile.<br />If you really want this CD to make your collection complete, wait a few weeks. You'll find more copies of this CD for sale than the Rolling Stones &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;.
B000002GIE|5.0|Oh thank goodness for Extreme.  This album repersents the birth of the band later to save us in the 90's from the horad guitar trash littering the FM airwaves.  Couple of the songs on here we could live without but over all excellent music.  Got to love Play With Me, which was in the movie Bill and Ted Excellent Adventure.  Also has some good quality slower song like Watching Waiting, or Rock A Bye.  Great stuff!!
B00005UKE0|4.0|After being relegated to only one or two songs on each Beatles album, George Harrison let his pent-up musical frustration<BR>explode on &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; a sprawling 3-LP (now 2-CD) set. While the album remains the best of George's solo<BR>career, and is of almost uniformly high quality throughout, its epic length was a musical overreaction to George's time in the<BR>shadow of Lennon &amp; McCartney, and results in otherwise great music becoming tiresome by the end.<br />Backed by an all-star cast of musicians, and produced by Phil &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; Spector, the sound of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;<BR>matches its hefty size. This is jangly George Harrison at his best, with a nice country-blues flavoring. The overall impression left<BR>by the album is sort of a happiness-and-sunshine (i.e. Beatlesque) flip-side to the Stones' sound of the same period (&quot;Sticky<BR>Fingers,&quot; &quot;Exile...,&quot; etc.).<br />Nonetheless, excessive length is the album's Achilles' heel. The 3rd LP (2nd half of the second disc on this set) consists entirely<BR>of an instrumental multi-song jam session.

Furthermore, with the exception of &quot;I Live For You,&quot; the bonus tracks added to this remastered edition do<BR>not match the quality of the original album. They're simply more unnecessary filler.<br />Had George pared this material down to only 2 LPs on the original release (perhaps using a couple of the shorter jams as<BR>instrumental interludes between the regular songs), &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; would have been an unqualified classic equal to<BR>&quot;Exhile on Main Street.&quot; Had he actually compressed his best material into one LP, it would have been a masterpiece of British<BR>rock, perhaps bested only by &quot;Abbey Road.&quot; It's unfortunate that he felt the need to release this material in the bloated manner<BR>he did(both then and now).
B000002GJ7|5.0|Oh boy this band was set for excellence after this baby was released.  More Than Words is a great song,  but Song For Love is Awesome.  We start to see the diversity this band can do with Hole Hearted, and When I First Kissed you.  Over all a hard rocker with some great touches along the way.  The only band to emerge from the Rock &amp; Roll crash of the late 80's early 90's to be productive.  Great Albume!

B000068R1X|4.0|Many people think that Ozzy and Sharon have re-recorded drum and bass parts for the 'Bark at the Moon' reissue. If you would listen closely, you could tell that they didn't. As a matter of fact, the original version of &quot;You're No Different&quot; was edited. On the reissue, in the beginning with the keyboards, its longer. The song also doesn't fade out. Centre of Eternity - It's hard to say about the bells, but if they were re-recorded surely they would sound better than that, but then again they did re-record 'Blizzard' and 'Diary', and they're horrible. Some of the remixes are a little overdone, like &quot;Rock'n'Roll Rebel&quot;. Most of the original solos are gone and have different takes of the solos. One song that sounded as if it wasn't touched was &quot;Slow Down&quot;. It sounded exactly the same. Some mixes even sound better than the original. I would say that for this reissue they remixed the most of the ORIGINAL tracks of the album (for example: &quot;You're No Different&quot; full-length). All in all it's not bad, but then again they changed history again, but I will still give it a four-star rating, because it's a great album.
B000066NW0|4.0|This cd is one of the better cd's i have heard in a long time people think Avril Lavigne is coppying her style off of Gwen Steffani but truthfully what does style have to do with the music and message someone puts out in their music! I knew all the words to all the songs in less than two days thats how many times i have listened to it and if you like skater punk music you will like this cd as well its not so much punk but still its good.
B000067CPX|5.0|Nothing gets better than this, this is a intense perfect album done by a band that Ive never thought was that good other than their cd &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;. There are epic &quot;Venice Queen&quot;, the carribean &quot;Carbron&quot;, the funk &quot;Can't Stop&quot; and much more. The songwriting is perfect and the length of the cd is great also.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I'll admit, I wouldn't have picked up this disc, much less heard of Sigur Ros, without the benefit of one of my best friends, who in turn learned of it from an HBO special (and who says nothing good comes of TV?)  Neither of us had heard it when he put it in the CD player while we drove around town doing errands, and by the end of the disc we were both stupefied.<br />The first thoughts that came to mind was that this was a nice Bjork imitation (Sigur Ros comes from Iceland, in fact), but that notion was shattered about 30 seconds into the first song.  The music truly runs that gamut, from almost-pop sounding catch-tunes (sorry, I don't remember which track numbers are which, it's still too fresh in my mind) to strange medley's of even stranger sounds to Pink Floyd-esque transitions back into spiritual-sounding Enya-like tunes.  That being said, \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" is extraordinarily difficult to describe except as a whole experience - this isn't one of those albums you just buy for one song which gets ripped to your hard drive while the CD collects dust.<br />But the experience is a wonderful one, if the listener is open-minded enough.  I wouldn't recommend it to the teenybopper crowd, but anyone who cares for good music will find much to interest them in \\"Agaetis Byrjun.\\"  The only complaint is that some of the music can get downright annoying when it switches into \\"high experimental gear,\\" but thankfully Sigur Ros keeps such interludes to a minimum.  Otherwise, it's a great disc, and would make an excellent \\"chill out with a drink after a long day at work\\" album.<br />Final Grade: B+
0375703764|1.0|This book did grab me...for a while. I'm a Gen X-er. I live in Los Angeles.  I can completely relate to the atmospheric backdrop of Truant's pre-psychotic world and thought a lot of the personal storytelling rang true.  I'll even go so far as to say that some of the writing here shows flashes of brilliance and is very vivid and engrossing. But ultimately I can't get over the author's haughty self-indulgence.  He's clearly enthralled with his own perceived cleverness.  Ultimately for me the book smacks of the over-intellectualized slacker conversations that permeate trendy coffee shops at three o'clock in the afternoon from people who don't have anywhere else to be. Don't believe the hype and don't let others snobbishly insist that if you don't like this book, you obviously don't have the capacity to handle heady material.  I'm a voracious reader of serious fiction and non-fiction, but this book is all bravado and no substance.
B000001FLE|3.0|While the \\"Rainbow Concert\\" marks Eric Clapton's comeback from drug addiction in the mid-1970s, it is for<br />Clapton completists only (or fans of Blind Faith, due to Steve Winwood's prominent role here). While the song<br />selection is superb, these live versions add no new revelations to the originals. And, like most live albums from<br />the 1970s, primitive technology results in muddled sound quality (which is only slightly improved through<br />remastering). Stick with E.C.'s studio recordings instead.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Not only does this marvelous film cater to one's desire for a peek at the neighbors, but it makes their daily round unrealistically interesting, attractive or affecting.  The courtyard of the Manhattan apartment I once inhabited had no lovely ballerina starting the day with graceful, sensual dance, or talented songwriter filling the night air with live, semi-classical piano.  Rather, my window opened on the blare and schlock of commercial television and radio.  <br />Jimmy Stewart's neighbors include not only a killer who considerately leaves his shades up for everything but the crime but also Miss Lonelyheart, who searches and grieves in full view, another woman who eloquently laments and protests (to all the world who failed to stop it) the murder of her pet dog, and policemen who arrive within seconds after being summoned to stop a fight.  Who would need movies if ordinary life were this alive?<br />Although Stewart is prone, with left leg in full cast, his role is something like that of a male ballet dancer, functioning as a kind of center off and around whom others play.  These \\"others\\" include not only his neighbors (for the most part unaware of him), but also his visitors.  In dialogue, we first see this with Thelma Ritter, who plays his skillful, no-nonsense nurse.  Stewart's unassuming, brief responses set off her fast, funny, caring, shrewd paragraphs.  For how many people do insurance companies provide nurses like this?<br />But of course the crowning wish-fulfillment is Grace Kelly as Stewart's would-be bride.  If there is another movie in which she is this beautiful, lead me to it.  The beauty is in her carriage, her looks, her clothes, her speech, her love, her intelligence, her pluck, her resourcefulness, her resilience, her good temper, her liveliness.  (That she stays superbly attractive is the more remarkable, since aggressive pursuit is not ordinarily a becoming posture.)  Here she is, mine to enjoy.  The more so, because Stewart's retreats leaveher more available to me, who would be glad to fill in.  <br />The murderer is played by Raymond Burr, who spent much of his cinematic life as a central character, Perry Mason.  Here, he mostly elicits action from others, rather than providing it himself, which is perhaps the fate of most criminals in detective stories they precipitate.  There is of course the last, frightening struggle between him and Stewart, a climax more crucial for the plot than for my enjoyment of the movie, which had already been signed, sealed and delivered. <br />By the way, two recent customer reviews see Stewart as totally or partly defenseless as Burr approaches his apartment.  But is he?  Why not lock the door?  He is physically able to move to the door and lock it.  He could unlock it again for friends or police. It is certainly frightening when a disabled good guy wrestles for his life against a strong bad guy.  But is this predicament really necessary?  Do we have an ending with no artistic necessity?
B000000IUN|3.0|Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, &quot;Reptile,&quot; makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with &quot;Backless,&quot; &quot;Another Ticket,&quot; and &quot;Money &amp; Cigarrettes&quot; all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans.
0671781383|5.0|DEFINITELY one of the best 100 books ever written. It is an absolute classic. It helped me to see that it our purpose (ie. attitude) that keeps us going, even if all we own is taken away.<BR>nobody can determine our attitude.<br />Besides that, this book has many GREAT QUOTATIONS! Here are just a few (of many) examples:<br />--\\"No one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them\\".<br />--\\"It is the characteristic of...fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid.\\"<br />--\\"The fear is mother of the event.\\"<br />--\\"In the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.\\"<br />--\\"It is this spiritual freedom--which cannot be taken away--that makes life meaningful and purposeful.\\"<br />--\\"If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.\\"<br />--\\"We who lived in prison camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"<br />--\\"The crowning experience of all, for the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has suffered, there is nothing he need fear any more--except his God.\\"<br />--George Stancliffe
B000002LA2|4.0|&quot;August&quot; may be one of Clapton's least popular recordings.  At times the mid-'80s production is a bit too slick.  And it is pop.  But &quot;Walk Away,&quot; &quot;Hold On,&quot; and &quot;Holy Mother&quot; are a few of the most beautiful pop songs E.C. has ever recorded.  Give this one a chance - you just might like it!
6304082428|5.0|I really love this movie! It's well acted and is the best Pride and Prejudice version I've seen. If Jane Austen was alive today, I'm sure she would approve of this version.
B000007R1A|5.0|In stark contrast with his unimpressive self-titled solo debut, &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; is a classic from start to finish.  From the mellow blues of &quot;Motherless Children,&quot; to the funky riff of &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive,&quot; to the classic rock staple &quot;Mainline Florida,&quot; this is '70s Clapton at his best and the place to start for the casual fan.
B00005YTN5|5.0|I just purchased this deluxe CD release of the Velvet Underground's Earth-shattering 1967 debut: &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, and boy am I glad I did! All the tracks have been remastered in 24-bit and have never sounded better.<br />This is a slick little product that comes with a beautifully put-together package, complete with peelable banana label and a handy little booklet; and if you do manage to un-peel your banana sticker, never fret, it's a vinyl cut-out [like colorforms] that can be stuck and unstuck indefinately.<br />There are two CDs: one in stereo and one in mono. For the record, the mono version was never released in the US before, and is the product before producer Tom Wilson remixed the tracks for stereo. (He felt the band would be more accesible to a wider audience if polished somewhat). The mono tracks have a somewhat grittier feel than do the stereo mixes and might explain some of the reason the Velvets were more succesful in inspiring English and European bands over American acts.<br />There are also a number of single release versions of some of the tracks, as well as a few cuts from Nico's 1967 LP &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; (which for trivia's sake, many of the songs were written by her boyfriend at the time, Jackson Brown). <br />This is first-rate, All-Star treatment of a true American legend! This is a museum-piece treasure that is a must-own for true fans of true Rock &amp; Roll everywhere. To not know this legendary album is to not know Rock itself!
B000003JA9|5.0|&quot;Aqualung&quot; is, quite simply, Jethro Tull's masterpiece.  The combination of hard-driving jazz-rock (&quot;Hymn 43,&quot; &quot;Locomotive Breath,&quot; and the title track are classics) with stately British folk-rock makes for a very rewarding listen.  Ian Anderson &amp; Co. were one of the most distinctive sounds on the British scene, and &quot;Aqualung&quot; is, for all intents and purposes, their &quot;greatest hits&quot; and &quot;best of&quot; in one compact studio release.  The lyrics may have been pretentious, but the music is just plain great.
0380820846|3.0|Julia Quinn is not one of my favorite authors (sorry, I know she has many loyal fans) however, I had found the books in the Bridgerton series enjoyable though definitely not keepers.<br />Romancing Mr. Bridgerton is the story of the shy wallflower Penelope Featherington and the dashing Colin Bridgerton. Penelope has been in love with Colin for most of her adult life however Colin was hardly even aware she existed most of the time. He saw her as his sister's friend and even pitied her a little. Colin returns from a trip abroad (the latest of many) and finally notices Penelope. This happens quite suddenly and this reader was never quite convinced of such a sudden attraction on Colin's part. What made Penelope so likeable and attractive all of a sudden? The reader is even told she hasn't changed much in the past eleven years. What was so different about her? If the author had explored this alittle further I think it would have made this a more entertaining read.I wish I could go further into the plot but I feel that it would spoil one of the main plots of the story, the identity of Lady Whistledown.<br />In short I felt the book was bogged down in the middle by the whole Lady Whistledown identity plot specially when it was made fairly obvious in the first couple of chapters who it was. There were some very romantic and endearing scenes in this book, but  you will have to slog through pages and pages of inane dialogue to get to them. Don't get me wrong I think Ms. Quinn is talented and she has some very brilliant moments in all of her books that cause me to recommend them. However, sometimes the dialogue in her novels, icluding this one, deteriorates from witty into idiotic very rapidly and I get the feeling she's merely filling up the pages.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a light read every once in a while. I DO NOT recommend it to any discriminating reader who may very well be turned off by Ms Quinn's anachronistic writing.

B00005JHCP|4.0|Get your hankies out for the first part of this movie.  Daniel Radcliffe is the young David Copperfield.  This is a 2 video set and is quite long.  A 2 nighter for some.  Young David, who later became Harry Potter, was surpurb in this film. His acting ability was excelent.  Even when I first saw this movie on tv and didn't know who Danny was I enjoyed it.  His acting ability at such a young age was so great you felt what he was portraing.  That's why I said get your hankies out for the first half of this movie.  MAGGIE SMITH is in it also in this movie.
B000059R8Y|3.0|&quot;Reptile&quot; is closer to the mellow sounds Eric Clapton reportedly favors as his tastes have matured.  If so, one can only hope he will be hanging up his guitar soon.  The album starts off with an instrumental that can only be described as Muzak.  And, while he attempts harder blues &amp; rock sounds as the album progresses, nothing on &quot;Reptile&quot; rises above the level of mellow adult contemporary.  &quot;Unplugged&quot; sounds edgy by contrast.  Increasingly, Clapton's efforts are undistinguished and musically impotent.  Perhaps now is the time to bow out gracefully.
B00000G5VI|4.0|This is an overlooked wonder by Bowie, primarily since importing it is the only way to get it.  After finding it, I truly see where the departure from his 80's &quot;fall from integrity&quot; got its firm foothold.  This is the missing link that explains the leap from &quot;Black Tie..&quot; to &quot;Outside&quot;, alright to brilliant.  A must for the true Bowie child.
B000002LJW|5.0|&quot;Journeyman&quot; may be the best latter-day Clapton album.  Ol' Slowhand incorporates the '80s energy and solid production values to craft one of his strongest recordings since &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard.&quot;  &quot;Pretending&quot; is one of the best rock songs of the era, the acoustic break in &quot;Bad Love&quot; is genius, and &quot;No Alibis&quot; is just good clean classic rock fun.  One of the best albums of the decade.
B000065V1V|4.0|Bowie is alot like technology.  It began strong, grew stronger, lost its momentum and declined shortly, but just like the revelation of the internet, rose again in all of it's original glory.  And so it goes with Bowie, while technology is in stasis to reinvent old ideas, Bowie brings the world &quot;Heathen&quot;.  Now the Berlin era feel is there I admit, but this time the approach is darker.  Like &quot;Hours&quot;, it seems Bowie is finding more inspiration in the darker side of life for this album.  The Pixies cover, &quot;Cactus&quot;, is a more melodic version of a simple song; which makes it all the more amazing.  Bowie shows us that life continues as does music, and I hope he lives forever so I can hear 100 more albums by him...at least.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|&quot;Behind the Sun&quot; is not a favorite of most fans or critics, but it's one of mine.  With this album, Clapton finally abandoned the mellow, laid-back (and often boring) country rock of the late 1970s and mastered the more electronic (and energetic) sound of '80s radio.  The sound is more dense and satisfying.  &quot;She's Waiting&quot; and &quot;Forever Man&quot; are Clapton's hardest - and most convincing - rockers since &quot;Layla.&quot;  &quot;Something's Happening&quot; is pure pop-rock joy, and &quot;See What Love Can Do&quot; is uniquely beautiful.  Don't miss out on this gem!
B000067CPX|5.0|A few days before my By the Way order from amazon.com arrived I read were critics were saying that this By The Way CD was The Red Hot Chili Peppers Best ever or at least as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magik. And of course my first thought was No Way, that album is an all time classic. And on first listen to this new CD I still said no way. But I have to tell you as I continue to listen, over and over again, it gets better and better every listen and I do think it is a great album, almost as good as the aforementioned classic.<br />Ever song is anywhere from good to great on this CD, the singing and especially the harmonies are wonderful the CD has such an upbeat feeling and it has an experimental feeling that reminds me of the latter Beetles. The Music is absolutely top notch, the lyrics are great along with the fantastic harmonies and wonderful playing (John and Flea are the best going today) the CD puts me in an introspective yet upbeat mood. I love the whole CD and the highlights are By The Way-a rocker, Universally breaking a Bettlesque ditty, Don't Forget Me-wonderful Guitar work, Minor Thing-very cool song, Warm Tape-anotehr rocker, I can go on and on, This CD is good from cover to cover. This will go down as a classic for sure.
B000002MTU|3.0|&quot;From the Cradle&quot; was supposed to be Eric Clapton's authentic tribute to his blues roots.  Unfortunately, white musicians tend to have an irrational inferiority complex when it comes to black music, and the extremely talented Eric Clapton is no exception.  E.C. tries so hard to sound authentic that he ends up bellowing most of the songs.  Instead of showing that he can play the blues, it sounds like he's trying to prove that he actually has the blues.  &quot;Motherless Child&quot; and &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot; are great tracks, but &quot;From the Cradle&quot; is an over-the-top embarrassment.
0316666343|4.0|I read this book in less than two days.  I found it fabulous.  The author, Alice Sebold's, strength in storytelling lies in her intricate weaving of the story's facts with poetic similies and methaphors.  Her words spun a web of remembrance of being a teen and wistfulness for the lost life of the main character of the book.  <br />As a mother, I found myself sometimes in tears as I thought of what had happened to the narrator of this story, who has been murdered.  But I did not find it morbid or dark or depressing.  The hopefulness of teenagers comes through and brings the story energy and smiles, offsetting the fathomless pain of losing a young child.  <br />In the way that *The Hours* by Michael Cunningham is written so powerfully and fluidly, so too is *The Lovely Bones*.  The contrast between these two stories, however, is in the movement and pace of Sebold's work which carries the reader along the seemingly unending waves of teen age life.  We are given detailed descriptions of Susie and her family's daily life without ever stagnating.  <br />I found the ending a bit lacking and was dismayed at the touch of high school girl fantasy which cropped up.  But again, it was told so amazingly that I was able to overlook the bit of stumbling of the plot.
B00005R0VG|3.0|Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, &quot;Reptile,&quot; makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with &quot;Backless,&quot; &quot;Another Ticket,&quot; and &quot;Money &amp; Cigarrettes&quot; all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans.
6305308659|5.0|I was reminded of how good this movie is after watching ABC's broadcast...commercial interruptions notwithstanding. I've also seen the other positive reviews, and wanted to add mine. &quot;Pleasantville&quot; stands as a work of art both technically and narratively.<BR>   It is a fantasy, of course, so it is unfair to judge it on any other level. Once past a fairly clumsy setup, the movie takes you along with it to a time that really was idyllic only in our memories...but what a beautiful way it is depicted! The fictional Mayberryesque town is gradually changed by the two characters brought into it. Tobey and Reese are brilliant in approaching their roles with the right mix of seriousness and levity, blending into a story with a powerful messages. The metaphors can be heavy-handed, such as the town's &quot;shaking hands&quot; logo being eerily like a swatstika, and the courtroom balcony, but it still packs a wallop when we first hear the word &quot;colored&quot; Most touching for me was the transformation of Reese Witherspoon's character, as well as the usual knockout performance by Joan Allen .If you haven't seen it, you won't be disappointed. It's a brilliant film overall, and truly a must-see.
B00000INKE|5.0|&quot;Journeyman&quot; may be the best latter-day Clapton album.  Ol' Slowhand incorporates the '80s energy and solid production values to craft one of his strongest recordings since &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard.&quot;  &quot;Pretending&quot; is one of the best rock songs of the era, the acoustic break in &quot;Bad Love&quot; is genius, and &quot;No Alibis&quot; is just good clean classic rock fun.  One of the best albums of the decade.
038533558X|5.0|I read this book as soon as it was available because I really enjoyed 'Tell No One', Harlen Coben's previous novel. Despite the similarities in the story line this was a very compelling mystery with plot twists that had me surprised at times. I could not put it down and will be first on line to buy Coben's next book.

B000000WG4|1.0|like the other oldfield disk I recently purchased (based on 5-star reviews), I hated it. It's dumb, slow, rip-off rich, and mediocre synth music at best. I apologize to all you people who love it, but customers should not expect a full-on dance jam or anything intense or passionate, but rather, dreamy music that fails to inspire a feeling or anything but fart noises..sorry
B000000IU9|3.0|Eric Clapton's self-titled debut is actually a disappointing mistep.  &quot;Easy Now&quot; is a beautiful ballad, and &quot;Let It Rain&quot; is a classic, but the album as a whole is just a bit too mellow, and the all-star cast of supporting musicians simply overwhelm the main attraction.  In light of the masterful performances Clapton was recording as part of Derek &amp; the Dominoes around the same time, the overall weakness of this album is astonishing.
B000002MZ6|1.0|this album ... it's painfully slow and often seems like a poor [copy] of ENIGMA. Buy it if you dare (everyone seems to like it) but DO listen to those previews. I just felt it was made by some guy and his mediocre computer from the early 90's. ICK...

B00005221L|5.0|Predator is a great movie and all, but did you know that before the casting people got Kevin Peter Hall to play the predator, JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME was going to play it? I bet you didn't.  He actually did play the predator for the first few weeks of shooting, but instead got off the movie because it was weakining his stamina, which he decided hwas a good idea to save for his next movie, &quot;KICKBOXER.&quot;
B00000ILLS|5.0|\\"Unplugged\\" is Eric Clapton's latter-day masterpiece.  It's intimate and moving with a rich, organic sound.  And, rather than simply rip through his biggest hits on acoustic guitar, E.C. had the good sense to throw in some lesser-known material and experiment with re-interpreting his past work.  \\"Signe\\" is a beautiful instrumental, \\"Alberta\\" is a swinging blues that's perfectly suited to the stripped-down treatment, and his jazzy reworking of \\"Layla\\" stands up well against the landmark original.  This album should always be considered one of Clapton's best.
B00004U3UG|4.0|If you are looking for a gripping drama with an Oscar-caliber script, Army of Darkness is not for you.  However, if you have a nose for comedy, think Monty Python-type humor is hilarious, and love to quote movies, then quit reading and get this movie!  In fact, if you don't have all three in the Evil Dead series, shame on you!<br />Army of Darkness is one of the best movies to watch with a whole bunch of friends, and can be watched over and over without losing its appeal.  If you've ever played the computer FPS game Duke Nukem, then you know half of the script, as many of the quotes were taken directly from AoD.
B000002G8H|5.0|&quot;Slowhand&quot; maintains Eric Clapton's delicate balance between mellow 1970s country-rock and great guitar-rock riffs.  With tasteful musicianship and the proper homage to his blues roots, Clapton puts out yet another '70s classic.
6305508550|5.0|You got to own this movie. I've watched it 20 times and still find little bits of humor. Mike judge even makes a cameo as the Jennifer Annistons (sp?) boss at chotskies. The printer scene is also hillarious. Its a typical gangster beat down of the &quot;PC-Load Letter&quot; machine. Its a sleeper hit and cult classic for office dwellers.<br />So I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and buy this movie ummkay. Great. (you'll get this when you see the movie)
B000000IT0|5.0|In stark contrast with his unimpressive self-titled solo debut, &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; is a classic from start to finish.  From the mellow blues of &quot;Motherless Children,&quot; to the funky riff of &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive,&quot; to the classic rock staple &quot;Mainline Florida,&quot; this is '70s Clapton at his best and the place to start for the casual fan.
B000067CPX|5.0|By The Way is their second best cd(first being blood sugar sex magik)and is a great follow up to Californiacation. It is a little mellow and slowish a times, but you can hear how the band's style has changed and evolved in a awesome way. One of my favorites is \\"Cant Stop,\\" but there are so many great songs on this albumn that I just cant name one to be the best. In closing, if you already are a RHCP fan or havent gotten into them yet, you gotta buy this cd

B00005N5S5|5.0|The newly mixed 5.1 soundtrack is catching up to today's standard which is compatiable with requirement of home enterainment. The soundtrack of the old edition is somewhat &quot;out dated&quot; - mono, though it can perserve and adhere the origin of the film. I like the new soundtrack which greatly enhances the experience of watching the film. I enjoy it.
B000001EEN|3.0|While the \\"Rainbow Concert\\" marks Eric Clapton's comeback from drug addiction in the mid-1970s, it is for Clapton completists only (or fans of Blind Faith, due to Steve Winwood's prominent role here).  While the song selection is superb, these live versions add no new revelations to the originals.  And, like most live albums from the 1970s, primitive technology results in muddled sound quality (which is only slightly improved through remastering).  Stick with E.C.'s studio recordings instead.
B00005JKNF|2.0|This movie can best be described as a long winded and artsy fartsy cross between Murder by Death and Clue. Don't agree? Stop pretending your a snob and admit this kind of thing is best left to Neil Simon and Tim Curry.<BR>Not to say it's not a good movie, it's well acted and written. And it's directing even makes sense, I'm sorry, Altman is usually a terrible director technically, old documantary styles die hard I guess. But this is such a tired idea, done in comedies and dramas from dime store novels to classic films. WHY DID WE NEED TO SEE IT AGAIN AND SO BORING AND MUDDLED AND OVERRATED??!! With so much creative film making going on out there (it's there, get off you chair a LOOK!!)why did all of the critics and the academy want us to see this thing so bad? Tell me it's good but nothing new, please don't lead me to believe they've made film making history because they haven't. Don't buy the hype here people. It's a good movie worth a rental, but don't expect to be terribly entertained. <BR>And they should include a flow chart so you can keep track of who everyone is, especially since no one \\"downstairs\\" can use their real name in the presense of anyone who is a resident servant of the host of the guests who have brought the servants who can't use their real names, only the names of the master they've come with. Not light hearted entertainment by any means . . .

0451191153|3.0|A surprisingly easy read for 700-odd pages, and a surprisingly easy read considering Rand's unique mixture of sexual and philosophical babble. This book is of course the manifesto for ultimate license of the 'artist',love song to the ego of the superman etc etc. so there isn't so much dialogue as rhetoric throughout. Plenty feisty ladies dislike Dominique (\\"I wish I'd never seen your skyscraper!\\") Francon's rape scene, but it doesn't bother me because the overall mood is, well, camp.  <BR>The themes are uncomfortably neo-Nietzchean and right-wing for me, but I like the work of Lloyd Wright and Rand basically took him as inspiration. This preposterous novel is required reading nonetheless.<BR>* Check out the wonderful dramatic & oversexy 1940s movie version with Gary Cooper in it and phallic imagery the likes of which has never been seen since.

0312265859|4.0|While I always enjoy the explots of Stephanie Plum.  The ending cost her a point, weak is being very polite.  Without spoiling it for anyone.  She could have had the same ending on page 50 just as well as page 300.  But, of course we wouldn't have destroyed at least 2 cars would we?<br />Oh well, it was still FUN.  Just work a little harder on the ending. Ok.

B000000OQF|5.0|My nephew is in into the big metal bands of today... Korn, slipknot, you name it.  To him, Nirvana is ancient history. I've constantly been telling him the \\"rock\\" bands of today are ..., so brought the AFD on a car ride with him, cranked it and blew him away.  He bought AFD and is now addicted.  The Illusions albums have some killer songs on them but a lot fluff.  If you took the 10 or 12 best songs on that album and made one album you'd have a classic in the AFD range... ...The band is really in the groove on those songs and Slash just kicks ... on every song.  The live album is ...good to... Songs like Rocket Queen and Welcome to the Jungle are better live... As for the next album? who knows.  Axl is a great talent, but losing Slash might be a fatal blow... Maybe Axl can create something new and as good... But it ain't the G&R of AFD without Slash... Slash's latest album is pretty good if you want to hear the best guitar player alive really rip....
B00000ILLQ|4.0|&quot;August&quot; may be one of Clapton's least popular recordings.  At times the mid-'80s production is a bit too slick.  And it is pop.  But &quot;Walk Away,&quot; &quot;Hold On,&quot; and &quot;Holy Mother&quot; are a few of the most beautiful pop songs E.C. has ever recorded.  Give this one a chance - you just might like it!
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is simply amazing. Full of famous hits, unheard-of masterpieces, bizarre tracks and everything in between, the White Album stuns me everytime. I also have the Blue album and i've got to say this: the White is much more daring and therefore more of a love-hate thing. Some of the songs require a break-in period for first-time Beatles listeners but once accustomed, these songs are beautiful.

B00005YXZH|5.0|With &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,&quot; Jeff Tweedy &amp; Co. have completely abandoned their alt-country roots - and created an absolute masterpiece in the process.  Great songwriting, unique arrangements, interesting sonic effects, heartfelt vocals, and the perfect balance between acoustic humanity and studio experimentation.  And the album opens and closes with a bang - &quot;I'm Trying to Break Your Heart&quot; sets the mood with a bluesy, soulful take on Radiohead, while &quot;Reservations&quot; wraps things up with an achingly beautiful love song.<br />&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; updates the best of progressive rock, power pop, and American roots-rock, and raises the bar for a new millenium of music.
B00005JKCF|2.0|I am probably the only one who doesn't like Spider-Man.  I did not like this movie for two reasons, the first reason was the special effects were really bad and most of the time you could see how fake it looked on the movie screen and imagine how it will look on television, the second reason was The Green Goblin he was not convincing as a villian and he wasn't even scary.  It even took a little from Batman(1989) in the parade scene when Macy Gray sings and in Batman Prince sings.  I'm sorry to people who love this movie but I just don't like this movie at all.

B00004XPP0|3.0|This is a great collection of the Star Wars Trilogy.  The original, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi.  The second two movies feature my favorite characters Yoda and Jabba the Hut.  The storylines to these movies were thin but you didn't care because of the special effects but on VHS these movies seem really poor.  I say add it to DVD and then I will buy it.

B000003JDO|5.0|&quot;Aqualung&quot; is, quite simply, Jethro Tull's masterpiece.  The combination of hard-driving jazz-rock (&quot;Hymn 43,&quot; &quot;Locomotive Breath,&quot; and the title track are classics) with stately British folk-rock makes for a very rewarding listen.  Ian Anderson &amp; Co. were one of the most distinctive sounds on the British scene, and &quot;Aqualung&quot; is, for all intents and purposes, their &quot;greatest hits&quot; and &quot;best of&quot; in one compact studio release.  The lyrics may have been pretentious, but the music is just plain great.
0151008116|5.0|Pi and Richard Parker were a wonderful pair as they rode the waves together on their 26 foot boat for over 200 days.  At the beginning of the book I wasn't certain where the story was going with the zoo and animal descriptions, and the exploration of religions. But I never lost interest.  And then the journey and the shipwreck and it all came together. I felt his thirst and hunger and fear and dehydration and sun burn.  It was a wonderful summer read.  And I loved Richard Parker.
630460288X|4.0|This movie combines &quot;Brave New World&quot; with Sylvester Stallone's typical action.  Combine that with it's great one-liners, it a good bet.
B00005B6C9|4.0|This is good, gently nostalgic music centering especially on the groups' great harmony.<br />The title cut sets the tone with emphasis on harmony and beat merging together.  This cut is followed by more great harmony and stimulating beat.  <br />However, on the seventh track, we have sort of a change, and a group of very distinct musical statements.  &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; comes off as a tribute or homage to the Tin Pan Alley era.  <br />This is followed by the sober, off-beat, poignant &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot;, delivered by Barry.  This is emotional enough a song to call for some loosening up, and we get that with &quot;Embrace&quot; featuring Robin.<br />But &quot;The Extra Mile&quot; is again off-beat and very dramatically effective.  And again, we're ready for a return to something a bit more typical, and we get it with a grand finale.  &quot;Voice In the Wilderness&quot; which really goes a bit further than the group did in they heyday should be a very satisfying conclusion to what is indeed a very good set, not quite up to their best, but good enough to please and for me to recommend.
B00003CXCK|5.0|To say Schindlers List is a cinematic achievement still degrades this film. Spielberg put all of his heart behind this and it really shows. From the acting, to the directing, to the scarring images of the concentration camps, this is without a doubt a landmark achievement. The ending is just about the saddest ending ever. You will let a tear out of your eye, even if you are a hard hearted old man. Oskar Shindler (Liam Neeson) is a very rich man, stuck in the middle of the holocaust, as a Nazi. He took every cent he had to make sure that over 1,000 \\"Jews\\" would not die at the hand of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi. He literally went bankrupt just to save the lives of these people, who did nothing wrong, but because of their relegion were massacered in the thousands because that ignorant S.O.B Hitler wanted to rule the world. To see this and not weep should be a sin. I hope that everyone else feels the same way. I absolutely cannot wait for this DVD to be released, (hopefully it will have a ton of extra features).<br />\\"This pen, this pen right here, could have saved two more lives. This car that I own could have saved another...fifty. I---I---I just wish I could have saved more\\" --- Oskar Schindler
B00005JKQZ|4.0|drama about the growing schizophrenia of a brilliant mathematician. Based on the story of a still-living Princeton professor, John Nash. Russell Crowe's starpower continues to amaze here as it did in Gladiator and LA Confidential. Apparently the screenplay takes some liberties with the real life of John Nash, but the subject and his filmic counterpart are interesting enough to spur some people to become interested in a variety of cool things after seeing this movie, namely economics, math, and psychiatry. Can that be all bad, naysayers?
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all let me start off by saying that I did get to view Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, right after I seen this. There is major diffrences. I loved this one, but the originals are too old for me to enjoy. But this is beyond superb. From the special effects, the acting and the directing, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is without a doubt one of my all time favorites. I loved the fact that Liam Neeson was in this. (He actually gives a superb performance as Obi Wan Kenobi's [Ewan McGregor] master). But like I said, I'm not a fan of the originals. If I was then I would probably dislike this as well. But the new generation accepts this and loves it! The DVD Transfer is beyond superb (one of the best DVD's out to date). I loved Jar Jar Binks (which is my favorite character) who is so funny that you will laugh until you cry. (Or for the die-hard fans, cry till you laugh). The battle scenes are absolutely marvelous and breath taking!
0307120007|5.0|This book was given to my daughter as a gift and I must say that this book was a big success to my 2 year old daughter and my 3 year old son.  They love the book so much that not one day goes by without us reading the book together.  It is a fun book for babies as well.  The touch and feel is what makes this book fun to read and fun to play with as well. We love it and we are so sure that  you will too.
B000066JES|5.0|ManOwaR's style has been steadily evolving since their debut release.  This latest addition to their collection does not disapoint.  It has a great range of styles on the cd will fit nearly everyone's tastes.  Anyone who calls this release anything but a true ManOwaR release was never a true fan.  It does me proud to add this compiliation to my collection.  HAIL!
B000068QVN|5.0|Holy PARC!  This release blows my KCID off!  Mel is King, OK.
6302969352|5.0|This is quite possibly the most believeable movie of all time. There is such a deep sense that these actors are real villagers in true peril. The samurai, exude class and brilliance FAR beyond anything seen in The Magnificent Seven. Cinematography has a very wide range, as do the characters and depth of feeling. A true classic.
B0000640S1|5.0|Sly preform really well in this movie. I have been watching First blood since I was a kid and I never got bored of it. evreywhere in the film there is action. I mostly liked the part where Rambo jumps off a cliff avoiding from being shot at.
B000002J1U|5.0|I own the first 5 Led Zeppelin albums.  They have been one of my favorite bands since I started liking music.  This is a nice, more acoustic album.  If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin and like their more laid back, acoustic stuff, don't deprive yourself of this album.  There are also a few hard rock tracks.  &quot;Immigrant song&quot; never really grabbed me, probably one of my least favorite Zeppelin songs.  Not great for the first song on this cd.  &quot;Celebration Day&quot; is another hard rocker, and that one I love.  The heavy, bluesy &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is classic Led Zeppelin, and could have easily been on Led Zeppelin II.  Most of the rest of this album is acoustic, and it makes or a very nice listen all the way through.  While all the songs are nice, &quot;Tangerine&quot; is my favorite on the whole album.  I think it's the best acoustic song Zeppelin has ever done, aside from &quot;Rain Song&quot; on Houses Of The Holy(another great album).  Overall, if you like Led Zeppelin, you shouldn't be without this.  It may be softer, but it's just as good as any other album they've done.  I also recommend Led Zeppelin I and Houses Of The Holy, which are in my opinion, Zeppeln's best albums.

0345413377|5.0|The action-packed last book, The Amber Spyglass, of an AWESOME trilogy, was one of those books I'll never forget.  Throughout the book, different events are happening and like all good books, the author leaves you hanging at the end of every chapter.  I couldn't put this book down! For anyone who loves to read as much as I do, I would definetly recommend this book and the rest of the series.  The characters in the book are so well developed that you feel you've known them for a long time.  The religious aspect of this book was a bit different to put it mildly, but if you aren't willing to accept other viewpoints on religious happenings then just don't read books that will upset you!! The ending was so perfect but TOTALLY unexpected!! I must admitt I cried a lot and didn't want it to end the way it did, probably because I love a good, happy ending.  When i finished I found myself wishing for more of Lyra and Will and especially Pan who was my favorite character throughout the book.  If you love fantasy, adventure stories this book is for you.

0553106635|5.0|There is no question that this book, and this series (to date) deserves 5 stars. <BR>Tolkien opened up new concepts for us, and indeed created a unverse, Martin is one of the movers and shakers of that universe.<BR>If we look at an author we have to consider them to be Gods in a sense. They are the creators of their worlds, and in another sense they are the parents of all of their characters.<BR>George Martin woould be a terrifying parent to any character that he has created. He has no sense of loyalty to his characters ( read children), and has no problem portraying the brutal fact that in a feudal society those who are of a good bent often end up coming to a bad end. <BR>It is unsettling and refreshing at the same time to realize that a character that you are identifying with and have come to like, and for that matter are rooting for should suddenly end up DEAD. <BR>I have only one complaint and one concern for the series. First the complaint: it is not being updated swiftly enough. <BR>My concern is more to this point. the next book in the series was supposed to be a Dance with Dragons, but now is being reported as a Feast of Crows with book number five now to be a Dance with Dragons hmmmm, I am hoping that he is not simply going to add material in the manner that Robert Jordan has and draw this out into a cash cow.

0312265859|5.0|How can you not love Janet Evanovich? Whether you like romance, suspense, or comedy, it is all there. I personally liked this book as well or better than the others. I laughed until I cried. After book 7, I couldn't wait to find out what happened between Stephanie and Ranger, but would have loved to have had more DETAILS from the bedroom scene. Many more details!... All the characters were there and at their funniest. As always I anxiously await the next.
0800129806|4.0|I think that they didn't cast it well. Julia Ormond is ok, but Richard Gear is terrible. personally I find Gear annoying and a slimy kisser playing Lancelot, the movie makers give you no reason to like him and Gwenevere together. There is no...I can't find the word for it, they just don't click. Throughout the movie I keep wondering why Gwenevere would pick Lancelot over Arthur(Sean Connery) who is a lot nicer, loves her, and is very good looking even though he is above middle-aged. However it is not bad to watch, a bit of a tear-jerker at the end, and good music by Jerry Goldsmith. If I could I would give it a 3&amp;1/2 star rating. You don't need to buy it, just go to your local video store.
0316666343|5.0|I heard about this book a month before it was out in bookstores.  It was considered the book for the summer, so I had to at least check it out.  I thought it might be over hyped, but it turned out to be an excellent read.  At the beginning I thought it would be hard to read about a murder and a little uninteresting.  It turned out to be anything but.  This book weaves the reader through so many emotions.  At one minute you are laughing out loud, than a few pages down you have tears in your eyes.
0345350499|5.0|I found this book to be wonderful reading, though perhaps not historically correct, Marion Zimmer Bradley obviously did not make it all up, I believe that she did study the Arthurian history.<BR>The Mists of Avalon was written beautifully. I especially like how Bradley (Marion Zimmer Bradley) had it narrated by Morgaine, by doing that she let the readers have more of a connection with that character. I thought it was wonderful to have strong women characters in this story because men are so often thought of as stronger than women, but it is not so. The only character I didn't like much was Gwenefar (however you spell it), because she was weak and didn't really stand up for what she believed in or what her opinion was, but naturally you dislike her because she opposes Morgaine. I also thought that Igraine stopped caring about her children once she was safe with Uther and only thought of herself. I almost liked Morgause because she seemed to care about Morgaine and wasn't really evil, just a little greedy. And I think Vivianne could have made better choices, she seemed too eager to sacrafice other peoples happiness for the Goddess when there was probably a better way. Even now I can't stop babbling on about this book. I found myself lost in this book and couldn't stop reading. I very highly recommend this book to any fantasy or arthurian lover. And may Marion Zimmer Bradley rest in peace wherever she may be. Blessed Be.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Okay, I'm forty and a stuffed shirt, sitting in my cubicle cranking this up, trying hard...to not rock my head back and forth to the rhythm of this great CD.  To classify this music with the Britney genre would be a great dis-service. Pink brings to mind such groups as Concrete Blonde and early Pretenders, bands fronted by women who could convey emotion, sentiment, and fury, all in the same wail. Gritty lyrics with some genuine with a personal voice.  Most of the songs here are really great.  Misery with Steven Tyler is a tribute to a frontman who should have retired years ago.  18 Wheeler, Dear Diary, and Lonely Girl are truly amazing.  Buy this and enjoy it.  Something tells me it won't be topped from her eventual later works.  Cheers!

0679746048|5.0|I have just finished reading &quot;Girl, Interrupted.&quot; It was so interesting! I know I am going to reread it over and over again. The plot is well developed and has only minor flaws. The main character, which is the author, Susanna Kaysen, gives to you her story, detailed and honest. It's basically about her problems and troubles dealing with mentail hospitals. She enters a hospital called &quot;McLean Hospital.&quot; She puts it in a very humorous way, showing the world what life is like inside the white walls of a hospital. She meets many people there, freinds and enemies, and deals with new experiences.<br />Susanna Kaysen is a very brave person to print millions of copies of her own experiences. She is a highly educated and should write more books! I highly recomend this over the movie, although the movie isn't bad...This book should be read by everyone, and should gain as much popularity as &quot;Go Ask Alice..&quot; Girl, Interrupted is easily a favorite for me, and after you read it, you'll love it! Happy Reading!

0060278234|5.0|This book was an excellent second book to Garth Nix's trilogy. You REALLY need to read the first one first though. When Lirael makes the dog and then fights the free magic creature I was amazed. Even if she did seem like a total misfit you had to love her because from the first chapter and her first suicidal attempt you could tell she was always in an adventure. Then when you heard about Sam- or Prince Samath -almost getting killed by Hands the first time you meet him! <br />But the best part comes at the end... which I WONT tell you because that would soooooo ruin the book seeing as how if you are reading this you have NOT read the book yet. But how the end just STOPS i mean it literally stops in the middle of the action! Its killer! but it was a great way to basically force people to buy the third book because you HAVE TO KNOW if that great spirit... the one with the nine free magic creaters of the Charter. yea well i wont say anymore but OH MY GOODNESS READ THIS BOOK! it is increadible! but make sure you read Sabreal before you read this one because it will be loads better!
0425152251|5.0|If you extracted the philosophical summaries from this novel, you could easily have another in the series of &quot;For Dummies&quot; books.  And I mean this as a compliment.  I wish I would have read this novel before entering graduate school in philosophy.  I now have a much stronger grasp of the history of philosophy--certainly stronger than anything I learned in graduate school.  Gaarder distills the essence of each philosopher and movement without losing anything essential.  This is a difficult task, and Gaarder should be commended for handling it admirably.<br />The truly interesting thing about the novel is the complexity of the narrative structure.  The stucture itself is philosophical--in other words, it provokes thought and leads to questions.  What is a &quot;world,&quot; narrative or otherwise?  Who is the &quot;author&quot; of our lives?  What does it mean to &quot;exist&quot;?  Are you more &quot;real&quot; than characters in a novel?  What does it mean to be conscious of one's own unreality?  If life is indeed a work of art, then all of these questions are urgent for anyone concerned with how to live one's life and live it well.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I strongly encourage Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David to release all 9 seasons with all episodes (do not exclude episodes that are not being shown in syndication).  Why is the greatest television show (even TV Guide agrees it's the greatest) not sold on DVD?  In message boards such as Bargainflix.com, Seinfeld is the number one requested item to be sold on DVD.  There is an untapped market for those who cry out for quality-produced Seinfeld DVDs -- give us our Seinfeld on DVD!
B00005QAPH|5.0|It's a toss up as to which film is the greatest film about film by a true film artist, and even harder to put this film up against Truffaut's masterwork simply because DAY FOR NIGHT hasn't been available on home video in an appreciable form ever. Both deal with a director having trouble putting a film together, but they're handled in two amazingly different, yet similar styles (with a bow/jibe to Fellini in Truffaut's work). It's also interesting to note that this film about filmmakig is perhaps the best examination of how an artist works in his medium using that medium - hard to visuallly dramatise the elusive discipline required for writing, singing, painting, poetry, dancing or sculpting on film, no matter how many times filmmakers in the past have tried. Yet 8 1/2 shows AND tells what's it's like to be a filmmaker.<br />Criterion's splendid rendition of Fellini's chez d'ouvere is a benchmark for the restorative process of DVD! The blacks have never looked this black, except maybe in Gianni di Venanzo's head - and the constast is startling, another reason why the major film distribution companies should spend the time and care restoring them pre-1970 catalogs.<br />The commentary is incredibly informative, the documentary a peculiar glance inside Fellini's head without the benefit of a narative structure and the visual commentaries by Lena Wertmuller and the incomparable Vittorio Stararo contextualize this film in a fascinating way.
B00004U8H4|2.0|This film is a half baked version of the book. This movie was obviouly thrown togather to attract a simple minded gore lover.

0375703764|1.0|When I took creative writing in the 8th grade, my teacher passed out a study on writers who used Macintoshes vs. writers who used PCs.  The verdict:  writers who used Macs spent too much time on formatting the appearance in a creative way and less upon the writing itself.  This directly applies to the fifty pages of spiraling text.  If you put the text in a single paragraph...  is it really that interesting?  If Danielewski had skipped the hundred pages of footnotes that are useless (why read fictional footnotes?  3 pages of fictional names?) and cut Johnny Truant (can anyone argue that this character is believable?  he was not charming enough to follow through with his sexual escapades, even his name is ridiculous); the story is readable.  Worthwhile though?  There are 15 haunted house stories that surpass this.
B00005JKJA|1.0|As if that wasn't enough, eh? First mistake, knowing that this movie was a critical darling, most of those are way too over the average joe flick (like me) kind of guy. Second mistake was not leaving when it started.<br />Right from the opening credits, this movie made no sense at all, as swing dancers dance away to a mostly purple colored background. Events lead to the car crash, etc etc. (You've probably read the synopsis, I won't bore you any more than this movie does)<br />Watts puts on such a goofy performance in the first hour or so, and her lines are so sappy that you want to reach for the mute button. Though the idea is that the performance and lines play into Lynch's little mind bender, it is a huge turn off to the movie.<br />Now, the only people who will get the plot are film majors, critics, and rabid movie fans with too much time on their hands. Now if this had been written like Pulp Fiction, with witty dialogue, humorish situations (exception noted to the hitman scene), and the same jump around philosophy, it wouldn't be as bad.<br />But this was awful, especially the cowboy guy. No clue what I'm talking about? Same here, Lynch gives us no insight to ANY of the characters except Rita and Betty, and Adam (who looks like he is a long lost member of Weezer), though even with these characters it doesn't make sense though.<br />To sum it up, this is a real thinker movie. Those looking for something to sit down, snuggle up to, or just watch for the heck of it, STEER CLEAR OF MULHOLLAND DRIVE AND TURN SOMEWHERE ELSE!
B000002LGQ|5.0|In the 1980s, Madonna suffered an affliction common amongst most young pop stars: success with no acclaim.  While she had no problem racking up Top Ten hits and selling platinum records, Madonna's critics, for the most part, saw her as little more than a tacky gimmick who spent more time baring her navel than her soul on record.  But \\"Like a Prayer\\" changed all that, for it was an ablum of surpirsing gravity and full of introspective lyrics.  Sometimes, when singers go the \\"take-me-seriously\\" route, it can come across as phony and contrived.  But the emotions conveyed on \\"Like a Prayer\\" sound pretty real.  She recalls her tumultuous marriage to Sean Penn on \\"Til Death Do Us Part,\\" addresses a stormy relationship with her father in \\"Oh Father,\\" and makes a tribute to her late mother in \\"Promise to Try,\\" a ballad strong enough to make a grown man cry.  And, yes, there are the hits: the bouncy \\"Express Yourself,\\" the title track with its effective gospel choir, the bubbly \\"Cherish,\\" and the pro-family \\"Keep it Together.\\"  This album marked a high point in Madonna's career.  Although she's still coming up with dance hits bouncy enough to make you shake your thang, \\"Like a Prayer\\" shows that she can deliver music that's not simply high on concept, but also high on content.

B000002MFN|5.0|By the end of 1990, Madonna was sitting on top of the world.  She had monstrously huge single (\\"Vogue\\"), launched a successful tour (Blonde Ambition), and released a smash greatest hits album (\\"The Immaculate Collection\\") which spawned a controversial yet popular single (\\"Justify My Love\\").  With all this and more under her belt, she released in the fall of 1992 her graphic \\"Sex\\" book and her \\"Erotica\\" album.  While the book was trashed by critics, the record was a disappointment on the charts.  It signaled the public's disgust for the onetime Material Girl, who otherwise released a very fine album.  The title track picks up where \\"Justify My Love\\" left off with Madonna's cool, spoken delivery against a mid-tempo beat.  \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" is an infectious house jam that could very well be \\"Vogue 2.\\"  Madonna is most impressive when she works with hip hop beats, as evidenced on the sensual \\"Where Life Begins\\" and \\"Waiting.\\"  The rest of \\"Erotica\\" has some of Madonna's most criminally overlooked material.  \\"Thief of Hearts\\" is a hilariously catty dis on a man-stealing woman, while \\"Words\\" is another housed-up tale on verbal abuse in a relationship.  But the disc's touching moment is \\"In This Life,\\" a soaring, sap-free ballad that has Ms. Ciccone paying tribute to a lost one who succumbed to AIDS.  While this record wasn't a bust, it fell way short of expectations saleswise.  Pick up \\"Erotica,\\" and let Madonna \\"put you in a trance.\\"
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Although I do consider myself a movie buff, I rented this movie without a great deal of knowledge about this film. This movie was an inspiring and detailed account of a person who deals with schizophrenia, and must overcome obstacles along the way. <br />Russel Crowe is great in his role as a Mathematics professor who has many hallucinations. The discovery of his condition by his wife is the real gripping part of the movie, as you see the sacrifices and emotional pain they must get through to make their marriage work. <br />As the audience becomes aware of the problem of Crowe's character, they pull for him to overcome his loss of reality. It becomes sad to see the great mind of John Nash slipping away from reality, and you become linked with the hope that he can return to his brilliant form. The concluding scenes are inspiring, and seeing the convergence of his wife's ability to accept his condition and his ability to overcome and be productive in his field that make this truly a classic story. <br />I recommend this movie, especially the DVD because of the extras.
B000002NJS|5.0|What's a woman to do? Madonna has worked with pop, house, r&amp;b, VH1-ready ballads, and even hip hop.  Next to electronica, the only thing she hasn't dabbled with is bluegrass (not that I'm waiting).  Four years since &quot;Bedtime Stories,&quot; she hooks up with remixer William Orbit for &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; which is no doubt one of her very best albums.  At the seasoned age of then 39, it can be tricky to pull off electronica on record, but surprisingly her voice nicely matches Orbit's synthetic production.  &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; and &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; show Madonna at her most lyrically mature.  And the real showstopper is &quot;The Power of Good Bye,&quot; which could very well be Mrs. Ritchie's best breakup song ever.  Musically, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is one fun ride.  Orbit gives us discocentric, trance-like beats that highlight &quot;Skin&quot; and the dynamite stomper &quot;Sky Fits Heaven.&quot;  &quot;Ray of Light&quot; introduced to us a new Madonna, who smartly reinvented herself on this impressive record.
B00006690F|5.0|Genius... pure genius.  While he is still the embodiment of [angry] white America, he shows how much he has matured since the Marshall Mathers LP.  He's a little more vulnerable, showing a bit more of his \\"softer\\" side. He obviously has learned from this mistakes and has no problem acknowledging it.  His 3 (commercial) albums are journals of his life, and I love listening to all 3 as they chronicle his life since '99.  And you just have to admire someone who, amidst all the \\"United we Stand\\" newly found patriotism and political correctness over the past year or so we have been bombarded with, has the balls to come out with a song like White America, and raps lyrics such as \\"...there's no mountain I can't climb, no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly...\\" and \\"more pain inside of my brain than on the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade...\\" in the clever \\"My dad's gone crazy!\\".  Shocking, inappropriate... but awesome!  The songs are funny, sad, poigniant, entertaining, thought provoking and addictive.  You won't get tired of listening to it.  Although I was a bit disappointed that he didn't kill Kim in this one... >:)
0783229526|5.0|the idea occurs to me that this movie is meant to make you laugh as you watch it and think on it afterwards. it's not just about senseless cheech & chong indulgence and stupidity, it's more of commentary on that era. The scenes from vietnam, the continuing military allusions, and the despondent overtones are there on purpose to make you think again about vietnam and the aftermath. the vague motives for being in vietnam parallel the search for the american dream since we were supposedly fighting to protect it. and its no mistake that every reference to the american dream is accompanied by some decrepit image is saying that the american dream is just as real as the lizards in the bar. the quote at the beginning also has some bearing on that.<br />so if you gave this movie a bad review because didn't get past the first layer then that's credit to your mental fortitude.
B00005R23S|5.0|What a great DVD for any Bruce fan! The clarity and quality of sound puts you right at the concert . You would swear you could reach out and touch Bruce and the \\"E\\" Streeters .The picture is that crisp and detailed . Can't wait to watch it over and over!
6302759110|1.0|This movie fails on so many levels it's difficult to know where to begin.  Keanu Reeves' ridiculously phony English accent provides great comic relief, as do Ryder's not-so-fabulous acting skills.  Both of them, they act like the same character in every movie they're in; how about some facial expressions besides just opening one's mouth in horror at something scary or surprising?<br />Having never read Bram Stoker's novel, I found the leaps in logic strange and awkward.  For instance, vampires can't be touched by \\"holy\\" relics?  How believable is that?  And also, I understand that Dracula killed because he was eternally starved for blood, but why did he rape someone?  It just doesn't make any sense, because in most of the scenes he seems like a sensible, sensitive being.  And there are many more instances of a badly-written script, which I won't go into.  Of course the problem most likely lies in how the book was written, but then the film makers should have altered the plot when transferring it to the screen.<br />Then there's oodles of female nudity, which really adds nothing to the film, except to titillate male viewers.  What about us female viewers?  Keanu and Oldman are fully clothed, except for one scene where Oldman has his shirt off.  <br />But still, it's worth watching just for Gary Oldman; he's wonderful as Dracula.  If only the movie had been written better.

B000001EHS|5.0|WOW!... I LOVE this CD so much! I listen to it ALL THE TIME!! When I draw, paint, read, drive . . . it's just TOO COOL!! Okay, so maybe I'm a fanatic. But it has all the awesome songs that made Def Leppard so popular: \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" (of course!); \\"Hysteria\\"; \\"Rock Of Ages\\"; \\"Rocket\\"; \\"Love Bites\\" (my FAVORITE song in the whole world!); and \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", just to name a few. Their style hasn't changed since they began. Hey, if you have something good, it's best to stick with it!! And oh, they've really got something good! Wow, there are sooo many memories associated with these songs (all good memories, of course!). Music can be so powerful and inspiring, and this is one heck of an inspiring CD! If you liked the good rock of the 80's and early 90's, then you HAVE to get this CD! It's a great party CD. It's a great mood-lifter. It's great to sing to. Oh, and it's the greatest CD in the world (in my opinion)! Shoot, I think I'll order another copy for myself! Mine is getting kind of worn out, after listening to it like 1000 times!! You can't go wrong with it. These songs will NEVER get old!...
B00003CX8Y|5.0|It's been over seven years since I saw the movie, and last night I picked it up from my shelf again. I had not forgotten the plot or the music or the script, but I didn't really like it as a kid, but when I saw it this time, I loved it. It was because I understood more and I truly believe that this is the best Disney Classic movie of all times (nominated for six Academy Awards). <BR>We follow the tale of Belle, who lives in a quiet village in a normal life. But one day she goes looking for her lost father, an inventor on his way to a fair with his invention, and she finds herself in a large castle with a mysterious beast. She finds out that her father had wandered his way into the castle and she exchanges her freedom to free her father. Soon, we see the beast's love for her and romance sparkle between them as time passes, with a little help of the castle servants, who have become enchanted into house hold items. The beast was a prince who's cruelty and selfishness doomed him to become a beast until he can learn to love and earn the love back, but before a magical rose stored in his bedroom start to wilt and if it does totally, he would be doomed to be a beast for all time. But if succeeds the spell would be broken.<BR>The characters are extremly well-thought of and they keep the movie alive. We have the bad guys, one by the name of Caston, the town buff and handsome who initially likes Belle, but his personality is cruel and selfish. We have his idiotic side-kick, LaFoo as well. All this is the normal type of characters he would see nowadays in a Disney cartoon. <BR>I'm sure nearly all of us have seen this masterpiece, and it's worth picking it up again!

0393314804|5.0|And when you read it you'll know why.<br />From the beginning you feel as if the characters were people you've known all your life.  Regardless of whether you're for or against drugs, this book shows herion for what it is and does a real fine job of it too.<br />The book is written in \\"Scottish\\", which I personally found delicious, although some have commented it is difficult to understand (it isn't, really).<br />The book's strongest point, however, is that it portrays life in Scotland and Britain and the various mentalities of the people there.  It's dead serious at times, hilarious at others, but intriguing throughout.  Either you'll love it or you'll hate it.  Probably the former, though.
0684803356|5.0|Robert Jordan is one of the most exciting, interesting and principled fictional characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about.  Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail.<br /><br />Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on.<br /><br />This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there.<br /><br />An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film \\"The Good Fight\\" narrated by Studs Terkel.  It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs.
0393039765|5.0|This book is not for the faint of heart... or stomach.  It is, however, essential to our generation.  We have no great wars, no Great Depression...<br />Our lives are empty, directionless, spiraling out of control, and the only way to get back on track is to let go of everything.  This is the lesson this book teaches us.<br />The mentality behind Fight Club is revolutionary and original.  The first rule of reading FIGHT CLUB: Open your mind and dive in.
B000002N3N|5.0|This was the fastest shipment I have ever received.  Thank you for so much for such prompt service.  And the CD is in excellent condition.  Will do business with again.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I'd forgotten what an excellent concert this was.  If you've got a DVD with 5.1 stereo--you should own this.  It's the next best thing to being there.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a fantastic, fresh, hilarious, strange and wonderful movie.  The story telling is weird. There's nothing like it. Amelie is great character. Some movies leave you with a good feeling. She will leave you with a fantastic feeling.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Before i got my hands on KMKMKM, i heard their previous work, granted, they were mostly punkish in nature (Primary, 100 years, Hanging Garden, etc) but i liked the atmosphere their music created. When i listen to this album (yeah, i'm that old to call it an ALBUM...) i was caught by surprised NOT by their fast paced songs but by all the slow ones, and ever since then, on every single CURE CD after that, i've been entranced by their mellow tunes. could that be age? hahha, i dunno, but how can one listen to tracks like catch or one more time and not be moved in some ways? and after all, isn't that what music's supposed to be do asides from getting your butt moving? Thank god for Robert Smith, support their music and go buy this CD!
B00005A46T|4.0|Okay, okay, yeah, the guitar sucks. It really, really sucks. But it certainly conveys the right message- AH! KILL EVERYTHING! AH!<br />And, the drumming is as ferocious as anything I've ever heard in my life. Absolutely amazing that anyone can play that fast and heavy. Corey Taylor is just as good a screamer as Tom Araya, or anybody else. This album combines the low guttural screams of Pantera with the thrashing death-slaughter-small-children-in-the-name-of-Satan lyrics of Slayer. The greatest tracks on here are The Heretic Anthem, Everything Ends, and My Plague (which has almost a, dare I say, nice/sweet sounding chorus), along with Disasterpiece- astonishing vocals at the end. Wow. This whole album is worth listening to over and over again until your ears bleed. And, oh will they ever bleed.
B000002LBH|5.0|Morrissey &amp; Marr, the 2nd coming of the british invasion. They were the Lennon &amp; McCartney of the 80's. Marr would go off and write the Music, then they go to the studio, and plays the music while listening to what Morrissey had written previously, and it somehow becomes a song, without much collaborations betwenen the two. Sometime, the band would laugh so much from what Morrissey had written that they had to stop recording. In almost every instance, this is how they construct their songs. one not knowing what the other was doing. yet, they made some of the most compelling music of the 80's that still resonates today! This is a great starter pack to get, but i think their best album has got to be Strangeway here we come, their swan song! just enough hooks to get you thru the strange lyrics that steven writes..
B000056K04|4.0|It cracks me up, the way fans react to DMB.  You go read the early reviews of Crash, BTCS, and now Everyday, you'll see a third to a half of those early reviews saying exactly the same thing - &quot;This is nothing like the DMB of old.  It is terrible.  I wanted to buy another (place name of previous album here), but this one is awful.  Everything has changed.&quot;  What's amusing is that, the next time around, the previous album always gets grouped in with the &quot;old stuff&quot;, right along side.  So, with Everyday, people say &quot;I hate this, it's nothing like the DMB I know and love.&quot;  It's just that the &quot;old DMB&quot; has already been many things, and everyone is so used to the old ones that they're all grouped together.  I think that each album so far has gotten unfairly rated down for this phenomenon, and you'll notice that the later reviews go higher.<br />With that said, after a year and a half, my final opinion on Everyday is that it is mediocre.  After trading for many live shows and hearing these songs explored and changed, I can say with veracity that these *songs* are quite good, but the packaging is not.  The whole album was made in 9 days (literal truth - lyrics, arrangements, and all) and it shows.  These songs are still in their most basic form.  Live, they've all grown interesting violin/sax arrangements (sadly lacking on the album) and have become longer.  So, in retrospect, this is like a first attempt, and it's a shame that it had to be released so quickly.  The upcoming next live DVD will have many Everyday songs on it, and it will show the growth that they've already gone through.<br />Oh well.  I guess even DMB isn't infallible.
B000002URV|2.0|I first have to say that I am a HUGE fan of dark, deep music.  I bought this CD expecting that,  Plus I love chants, and I was told that this CD was filled with them.  I have to tell you, the closest thing to a chant in this, is religious wailing.  It was a terrible dissapointment.  I wasted [$$$]on this CD.  Unless you are a hardcore fan of this band, DON'T GET IT!!  I only gave it 2 stare, because it had a FEW good songs on it, and the instrumental parts were ok, but VERY repetative.  I also have to say something else about the chants (if you like chants like me, you'll know what I mean),  chants are ONLY good sounding if they are in LATIN, not French, like they are in this CD.  I highly regret buying this.  The only time I would buy this CD if it was on sale
B00003Q438|5.0|One of my top 100 movies (I have seen 3000 or so). This is also a good transfer to DVD. Turn out the lights and enjoy the blackness of the deep and then see the glows of the &quot;aliens&quot;.
B000067CPX|5.0|This CD is a amazing piece of work.  This group has never been afraid to change or be different and has done so again on this CD.  Unlike most of the music around today these songs are about love and happiness and not about their small problems and hate.  This CD is a combination of psychdelic, funk, rock, and blues music.  There is not a bad song on this CD every song is unique and great.  My personal favorites are \\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Cabron\\", and \\"Tear\\".  All the songs are great though, they all have a unique sound, like \\"Midnight\\" which is unlike any RHCP song ever it has a orchestra playing with them that makes a real erry but beautiful sound that puts you in a mood like that painting of the swirling stars in the moonlight.  I think my least favorite song is \\"Throw away your television\\", but only because I'm not a big fan of the original RHCP, but I do really like the song especially the guitar solo.  So go out and buy this CD you will love it like I do.  I can't put it down.
B000067CPX|5.0|I bought this album with blind faith that it would be good after previously purchasing many of its predocessing albums. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have received mixed reviews on this album, some saying that it lacks soul and the edge of the old Chili Peppers. What I say is that this is the best example of a band's evolution through different styles, in an attempt to explore their own potential and give their fans the most. Yes, this is still one of their best pieces of work, even after over 20 years.<BR>Kiedis' vocals are ever unique and expressive, as Flea has produced some of the most high impact bass-lines as shown in the song that everyone will have heard by now, 'By The Way', showing that his bass-prowess. Frusciante's lead guitar emitts some of the best riffs showing that he is undoubtably one of the best guitarists around, and proves that he is the better guitarist out of himself and the greatest ex-Chili Peppers riff-merchant, Dave Navarro. This is demonstrated in such tracks as the outstanding 'Universally Speaking' and the 'different' and Spanish 'Cabron', where he plays his acoustic guitar with great conviction. 'Can't Stop' shows that the Chili Peppers DO still have exactly what has established them as one of the greatest bands of all times, mixing sweet harmony, with the rap vocals expressed so well in the likes of 'Around the World'. That said, although this album carries a more melodic style, it still oozes with variety, from the punky 'By the Way' to the acoustic 'Cabron' to the sweet 'I Could Die For You'.<BR>This album is undoubtably one of the best around, and must be purchased by anyone who is intrigued by this review, and all Chili Peppers fans. Fans like myself should appreciate the evolution of this band into what is still a fine state, something mirrored by such bands as 'Incubus'.<BR>I gave this album 5 stars, and I believe it is fully diserving of each of these. This album is technically astounding as it is played by a band who mix great lyrics, with wonderful scores. Because, yes, unlike 'Slipknot', these guys can actually produce some of the best 'MUSIC' around, as they have done for so long now.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is the second coen brothers film I saw, and now I'm hooked. The coen brothers style is so great and fresh yet original. This movie is so funny, George, John, and Jim all do wonderful jobs. This movie is one of my favorites.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The boys have done it again. Gone a little more electronicy, very atmospheric. Melodies are a bit more hidden than usual. Nice, nice, nice.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem's \\"The Eminem Show\\" I think is the greatest cd he has ever put out. I really like the song he did with his daughter. I would definitly reconmend this cd to all of my friends!
B00005LQ04|1.0|Don't buy this one. A few interesting camera moves and very outdated FX aren't worth the money for it. Don't believe the hype.
B00005U1YO|5.0|The Chemical Brothers: &quot;Surrender&quot; albumn.<br />Enjoy!
B000060P79|5.0|MY boyfriend went to the see the Pop Disaster tour and when he came back she said that the opening act was just as great as the show itself... SIMPLE PLAN! They'll be in a few warp tour shows so check them out there. I know I will. Great CD!
B00005KB9R|4.0|This album has a more earthy feel than its predecessor, \\"Catch a Fire\\", which had many lead guitar, keyboards and synthesiser overdubs added in England to make it more \\"listener friendly\\" for the American and British rock audiences. I really like the sound of \\"Burnin'\\", especially the early-seventies wah-wah guitar that was probably played by Peter Tosh. Although the album is famous for the Bob Marley song \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\", this is actually credited to the Wailers rather than to \\"Bob Marley and the Wailers\\", likely at the insistence of the two other \\"foundation\\" Wailers, Neville (Bunny) Livingston and Peter Tosh. And indeed, this album showcases the songwriting talents of all three. Two of my favourite songs on it (\\"Hallelujah Time\\" and \\"Pass it On\\" were written not by Marley but by Livingston (though credited to \\"Jean Watt\\"). Peter Tosh, meanwhile, not only co-wrote the rousing call-to-arms \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\", which starts off the album, but also wrote and sang the fine \\"One Foundation\\". Marley's songs do still dominate the album (which ends with a wonderful rendition of the traditional rasta hymn \\"Rastaman Chant\\"), and it seems that all the songs recorded but left off the album (and now included on the new \\"expanded\\" album) were Tosh and Livingston compositions- could this have had something to do with their subsequent departure from the Wailers?<br />Anyway, Marley's compositions include not only the aforementioned \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" and the incendiary \\"Burnin' and Lootin'\\", but also some remakes of earlier songs (e.g. \\"Put it On\\"; \\"Small Axe\\"; \\"Duppy Conquerer\\") that aren't nearly as good as the earlier, Lee Perry produced versions (although the sound quality is better here).
6305308659|5.0|Finally - a film that puts all those mawkish, nostalgic, selective-memoried baby boomers (e.g., Fonzie, Happy Days, sockhops, Dick Clark, Joe McCarthy, et al)and their conformist, socio-political, cultural \\"cheerleaders\\" (e.g., Bill Bennett, Pat Buchanan, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, G. Gordon Liddy, Fox News Network, et al) in their place - ...

To all my dope smoking, free love, tattoo-adorned, Pearl Jam-listening \\"homies\\", I SALUTE YOU in FINALLY bringing to a DEFINITIVE END a sacharrine era that went on WAY the ever-loving God too long (Hey Fifties, according to my calendar, you ended FORTY-THREE ...

EVER HEAR ABOUT THE IDEA OF MOVING ON IN LIFE, YOU COLLECTIVE MISS HAVISHAM'S OF THE WESTERN  HEMISPHERE?...Good God people, let the Fifties die already, will ya? You are showing your age (if not your cultural baggage)!...
B00005JLDW|4.0|I will agree with anyone who says there are holes in the plot, but that's why it's a movie and not a documentary.  If you are looking for an escape from reality for a short time, have at it.  The action sequences are highly entertaining and worth seeing for example sky diving dragon slayers.  As far a summer movies go, I enjoyed this movie much more than Men in Black II.
0671891634|5.0|Peter Lynch was a very successful mutual fund manager before he retired, and in this book, he outlines his methods at a level the average investor can understand.<br />Of course, this book doesn't tell the whole story of how Lynch was so successful, but it distills the essentials into an easy-to-understand, easy-to-apply presentation. This doesn't mean that investing is easy, but that Lynch makes his ideas accessible to people without MBA degrees.<br />What I really like about this book is that Lynch warns you about the risks inherent in investing, a point that few books of this sort bother making.  If you are at all interested in investing, read this book.  I've read it and I apply Lynch's principles in my own investments.  I especially recommend this book for people new to investing because it is very accessible.   Lynch and Rothchild did a great job with this one.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I heard the lead single &quot;I don't know why&quot; just once and I was hooked. She has sweet, sad lyrics that resonate with an almost dangerous intimacy. Norah Jones' voice is calm, sultry and vulnerable. The rest of the album is also well balanced, no clunkers in the mix. Buy one for yourself and one for your parents, especially if they grew up on Joni Mitchell.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I love this movie. It is a really good war movie. The story is about 2 young boys who grew up together and how they went to war together. It is a romantic, dramatic, and thrilling movie all at once. The actors were great, and the end was very emotionally moving. I cried when &quot;Danny&quot; died. It is a must, 10x better than Titanic.
0316666343|5.0|I bought this book on the spur of the moment, attracted by ...my need for some light summer reading for the beach last weekend.  Rather than rehash the plot for you, I will just say what I got out of it.  I could not have been more surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  \\"Luminous, brilliant, astounding...\\" are not overstatements.  I felt the whole book had a glow to it, and this reader, far from a mushy book lover, not a chick-flick type of girl, fell hard for this book (For the record, I'm a Roddy Doyle, Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan fan, so this is out of my usual author pool!).  I could barely put Lovely Bones down for two days long enough to reapply sunscreen.  There are so many thought-provoking angles to this story.  The exploration of the different family relationships, the adolescent realtionships and of perceptions of death and heaven made me think, but not in a depressing or morbid sort of way.  This is such a wonderfully, beautifully written story that I can't say enough about it.  Highly recommended.
B00005JLDW|1.0|Reign of Fire is just another bottom of the barrel action movie that shows us nothing we haven't seen before millions of times before.  There are a several reasons this movie is worse then your usual bad action movie, one is that there is nothing to cheer for, sure you want the humans to destroy the monsters, but if the whole world has already been destroyed and there are only a few hundred humans left in existence they can't rebuild the whole world, hehnce there is know point.  The other is the action is boring, it's the same thing done over about 4 times in a row, dragon attacks and 4 or 5 nameless humans get killed trying to kill it, who cares??  Half the characters who die are nobody's to the movie, so who cares if they die?  This movie is just another waste of movie, that's why there are movies like Minority Report available at the moment.
B00005T30L|5.0|What a wonderful surprise this movie is, unlike your typical teen angst dilemmas Ghost World showcases the world of the outcast. Yet in her own eyes Enid (perfectly cast Thora Birch) is not an outcast but merely someone who is above all the bland and boring that is mainstream. Her best friend Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) shares her view as they torture other losers and find their true identities. Enid's world view changes when she meets an older nerdish fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), she soon finds her relationship with Rebecca slipping as a whole new world opens to her in his world of antique records and pop art.  It is also apparent that Enid is just not ready to become mainstream in a world where everything is a Ghost World of imitation and mundane<br />Terry Zwigoff's world is a wonderful change from the super cool yet boring as hell popular kid movies where the big worries are the prom and if Freddie Prinze, Jr will get the girl. Ghost World is for the other crowd who didn't care about the popular kids and is a welcome change. Thora Birch captures Enid so perfectly with her caustic attitude and self-loathing persona. Steve Busecimi is great as usual in portraying Seymour as a sensitive loner who is content to live in his world of classic jazz and blues nostalgia. Yet the minor characters add weight to the film in their rich diversity, from Josh (Brad Renfro) who is the [reciepient] of Enid's constant badgering to the extremely funny antics of white [lower class citizen] Doug (Dave Sheridan) who makes a scene at a local convenience store. Bob Baliban, Terri Garr and Illeana Douglas turn in great performances in cameos roles that are well suited to their unique talents.<br />There are the usual goodies on the DVD yet the best item is the 6 minute clip from the Indian movie Gumnaam that Enid is watching and dancing too in the films opening.  The song \\"Jaan Pehechaan Ho\\" is one of the best opening songs to any movie and is such a catchy tune even if it is inHindi.
B0000009TK|5.0|This is an excellent live Zappa album. The upbeat version of &quot;Let's make the water turn black&quot; is absolutely great. This is one of my favorite FZ albums. Bravo Frank!! Five stars!!
B000002OX5|5.0|In 1967 a small band of awkward teens knew that The Who Sell Out defined a point of no return, and was more important than anything at home or in school. This is the real Who primer. It contains the grade-school version of every Pete Townshend masterpiece to come. &quot;Tattoo&quot; is every great Who melody in a single-song three minute opera. &quot;Rael&quot; includes the great Sparks/Underture theme from Tommy. &quot;I Can't Reach You&quot; is pretty much Townshend's entire solo career in a blender. &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; is Pete's hit single that never hit. It's so good that The Who have rarely tried to pull it off live. And for the guitar hero crowd there's the twin peaks of the all-time greatest 1-note guitar solo (I Can See For Miles) and the elegant solo acoustic guitar of &quot;Sunrise&quot;. If you can just buy one Who album....That's impossible! Start here. Then do what you have to do to get the rest.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones is the Billie Holiday/Eva Cassidy/Nina Simone of today. Voice, timbre, phrasing, articulation are all outstanding. She communicates and fascinates, thoroughly sings real songs and writes them too.<br />I predict a bright future for Norah immediately after she dumps the guy on the desk who thinks we bought this album to hear a drummer and the bored session musicians holding her back.<br />Buy this album for those tracks where her voice gets top billing.
B00006690H|4.0|First off, I would definitely reccomend buying this unedited, because everything even remotely bad is bleeped out (maybe I just got a bad copy or maybe they're all like that, I don't know). The main thing I was disappointed with on this album was I really didn't think there was a standout track. He always seems to come out with a rap/pop tune for the first single (i.e. \\"My Name Is...\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\") so I never judge his album by whatever the first single is. But I thought \\"Stan\\" from Marshall Mathers was one of the best rap songs that's come out in awhile. There really isn't anything like that on here. The main songs I would reccoment listening to are \\"White America\\", \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", and \\"Square Dance\\". \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" is an OK song, but (nothing against her) his daughter's voice gets very annoying. \\"Hailie's Song\\" is also OK, it is pretty weird hearing Eminem actually singing though (if you haven't heard it yet, and are curious if he's any good, I will tell you, I've heard better, but at least he's better than boy bands like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys). Bottom line is, if you're a big Eminem fan, you won't be disappointed with this. If you're just a casual fan though, I would either not buy this or at least listen to it before you buy it.
B000066C1N|5.0|This cd is a masterpeice by itself. When you add the movie it takes it to a whole other dimention. Just by listenting to this cd you get a sense of what the characters are feeling and seeing and doing all at once. Though, it seems that one might have to be a horse person to see the humor in some of these songs, such as get of of my back, it isn't nescisary. Again, this cd is absoultely fabulous. I'm normally not a fan of this type of music but this cd has automatically become on of my favorites.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book. Told through the eyes of a murdered 14-year-old girl, it is the poignant tale of her death's impact on her family and friends, and the long, painful healing process that follows. The author does a wonderful job relating what could be a very gruesome, morbid and unrelentingly sad story. Although there are many sad passages and heartbreaking moments, Sebold eases these painful passages by weaving in the narrator's memories of happier moments, her observations of the heaven around her, and her ability to live a vicarious earth-bound life through the eyes and thoughts of her loved ones. Sebold captures the perspective of an adolescent girl remarkably well in this novel, and the healing that eventually does happen in her story leaves the reader with a sense of satisfaction and relief. It truly is a lovely story.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The writers of Monsters Inc. are to be commended for their insight into making a movie fit for adults and children.  I took my five year old niece to see this movie and we came out raving about how wonderful it was.  Now you have to understand that saw this movie when it first came out, but my niece and I have been waiting somewhat impatiently for the time when we would be able to enjoy this movie over and over.  If you want a movie with laughs, excitement and even that moment when you brush away a few tears, this movie is surely to be you number one choice.
B000007MVD|4.0|\\"Live At The BBC\\" is definetly one of the top Beatles collections if you want to hear unreleased versions of songs, studio chatter, interviews, or completely unreleased songs by The Beatles. Many of these tracks may be familiar to Elvis or Little Richard fans. You must hear The Beatles' interpretations of these classics if you have heard the original releases. Some conversations are fun and interesting to listen to and give some information about The Beatles' personalities. Some versions found on this compilation are argueably or hands-down superior to the official Beatles release, especially on \\"Baby, It's You\\". The version of \\"Matchbox\\" found here is better in some parts than the one found on \\"Past Masters, Volume 1\\" or the \\"Long Tall Sally\\" EP. The version of \\"Honey Don't\\" found here rivals that of the studio version found on \\"Beatles For Sale\\" because it shows a different side of the band's style of playing it. It is sung not necessarily better than that version here, not by Ringo, but by John, and it sounds much more raw and faster. At times \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" sounds better because it has no heavy echo, but still overall is just about as good. <br /> Some unreleased songs are very enjoyable such as \\"I Just Don't Understand\\", \\"To Know Her is to Love Her\\", \\"Lonesome Tears in My Eyes\\", and perhaps the best cover The Beatles have ever done: Chuck Berry's \\"I Got To Find My Baby\\". \\"Nothin' Shakin'\\" also sounds great sung by The Beatles as well as \\"Lucille\\".<br /> The Beatles cover two more Arthur Alexander songs on this two disc set (the first Arthur Alexander song they covered was found on \\"Please Please Me\\"): \\"A Shot of Rythm and Blues\\" and \\"Soldier of Love\\". \\"Carol\\" and \\"Clarebella\\" are especially pleasing to listen to, as well as \\"The Honeymoon Song\\", \\"Johnny B Goode\\" and the funny speech track \\"Set Fire to That Lot!\\".<br />It's a wonder that the \\"Pop Goes The Beatles\\" radio show's theme was not here but there are twenty-nine tracks recorded on it. But as you can see the real gems here are not the re-recordings of Beatles songs but the unreleased cover songs found here. You won't find any Beatles song from later than 1965 here because they didn't record any more songs on the BBC after that point. These are not all of the songs The Beatles recorded on the BBC but if anyone can afford, let alone find the nine disc set entitled \\"The Complete BBC Sessions\\", they will have every song found here and 150+ songs (some are the same song but not the same recording, for instance there are four \\"Long Tall Sally\\"s found on \\"The Complete BBC Sessions\\" because The Beatles recorded it four seperate times at the BBC. There is a total of 227 song on the set)! But this is a great alternative and a must-have for any Beatles fan.
B000069CII|5.0|I have waited a long time for the latest album from Robert Plant. Having ordered the limited edition of &quot;Dreamland&quot; proved it was well worth the wait. The songs on this album are songs that are dear to the artist's heart. He sings with such passion and purity that the listener is immediately aware that Robert is singing songs that have not only influenced his own writing and career but are songs he truly loves. Having seen Robert perform many of these songs with his former band The Priory of Brion it is a beautiful and compelling trip down memory lane for me. I have seen Robert four times in England and each performance was amazing and quite special for me. Listening to &quot;Dreamland&quot; carries me back to those four wonderful gigs in May and October of 2000. For the listener hearing Robert's take on these songs for the first time will undoubtably hear the power of Robert's voice is, as it was twenty some odd years ago,as amazing as ever. There are new tracks on this album as well that were composed by Robert and his band Strange Sensation. &quot;Last Time I Saw Her&quot; is excellent, as is &quot;Red Dress.&quot; Listening to the new tracks makes one hope for future collaboration. For myself I have to say that the true highlight of the album is Robert's vocals on &quot;Song To the Siren&quot;, the Tim Buckley song. There is also an excellent version of &quot;Hey Joe.&quot; By all means get this album. It is a work of musical artistry by one of the greatest artists of our time. This is a man who truly loves life and loves what he is doing. This album is a must.
B000005HLV|5.0|This album rushes at you like a thousand winged demons flying through a blackened subterranean tunnel; bursts of flame spouting through fissures in the cavern walls. Euronymous's guitar work is sick sick SICK, pioneering the atmospheric blur that was to be the chief defining characteristic of the second wave of black metal. His savage attack hurls forward like the river of blood in &quot;The Shining&quot;, with countless intricate riffs bobbing to the surface before being swept back up in the current. Hellhamer's drumming both defines the forward trajectory of the music and accents the breakers in Euro's waves of controlled chaos. Again, this is an early instance of what was to become an important black metal convention: drum accents that barely contain the ugly noise clawing it's way through the darkness. This hyperactive insanity is topped off by the inhuman moaning of vocalist Attila. His much-ridiculed contribution actually works very well in the context of this bewildering music. The guy sounds like a maniac bursting into the dark woods after decades of confinement in an insane asylum, bellowing his bizarre internal opera to the indifferent silence of a moonlit winter's night. He is simultaneously cognizant of, and oblivious to, the winged creatures pouring from the valley behind him.
B00000ILDE|5.0|And yes, they do bite.  Not to mention that they have acid for blood and are virtually indestructible, plus their young will eat you for breakfast!  Move over, E.T.  These aliens are not friendly nor are they even humanoid.  This is a close encounter of the worst kind.<br />Get ready for some action because (unlike in &quot;Alien&quot;) the protagonists are well-equipped and well-trained, consisting of a futuristic space militia.  The acting is great throughout the movie in terms of character development and dynamics.  Standouts include 'Newt,' the orphan girl who finds herself in the midst of a war for survival, 'Bishop,' the android, and 'Vasquez,' the woman warrior.<br />&quot;Aliens&quot; is more than just an action film in a sci-fi setting.  It is also a psychological horror film, playing into a number of our subconscious fears.  These include fear of aliens (which in this case is justified), fear of childbirth, and distrust/paranoia of government, big business, and the scientific community.<br />The special edition adds a 15-minute scene with Newt and her family going on a field trip in an all-terrain explorer and is to be preferred to the regular edition.

B000002UAX|5.0|\\"The Beatles (White Album)\\" has too many tracks to review individually but all would get mostly the same treatment. Each song would be rated among the best The Beatles have ever recorded. I noticed that another reviewer said you should start your Beatles collection with this. I do not reccommend so, because,  if you purchased this album first (or \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Let It Be\\"), you would be disappointed with the earlier and simpler albums. <BR>  <BR> \\"The Beatles\\" is a finely crafted and well thought-out album with most every track providing the link to the next (\\"Rocky Raccoon\\"'s funky little finale piece provides the link to \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\"'s plane landing noise provides the link to \\"Dear Prudence\\", and the Spanish sounding guitar part at the end of \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" links to \\"The Continuing Story of bungalow Bill\\" to name a few). This was cool to me when I first got it, since it was the first CD I got like it (since \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"'s tracks were seperated for CD). Now that I have Pink Floyd CDs, I see that this is still cool, but slightly less cool than I thought at the time. The heavy rock songs like \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" fit perfectly on the album though they may stand out amongst acoustic songs such as \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\". Also there are tracks that are very unique in the Beatles' catalogue, such as the 20s or 30s reminiscent \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Martha, My Dear\\". Other songs are just plain flawless like \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Sexy Sadie\\", \\"Ob-La- Di, Ob-La-Da\\", and \\"Glass Onion\\". <BR>  <BR> Some of The Beatles' greatest ballads can be found on this album such as \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"I Will\\". Other tracks are just silly at times, like \\"Piggies\\" and \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\". <BR>  <BR> Ringo debuts one of his very own songs for the first time on this album, it's great, except I'm not so into country, though The Beatles and the formers seemed to always do country right, like Paul's \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\", or John's solo song \\"Crippled Inside\\" (in my opinion, the best country song ever) from his \\"Imagine\\" album, and of course this song. <br /> \\"Revolution 1\\" is not really better than its single counterpart, just different, while the completely unrelated \\"Revolution 9\\" is (to some) both disturbing and scary at times. The Beatles show that they can do The Beach Boys better than The Beach Boys on \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\". If you don't think so listen to The Beach Boys playing it and supplying the harmonies while Ringo sings it (I downloaded it off of Morpheus, so I'm not sure if it was released on disc or not).<BR>  <BR> All things considered \\"The Beatles\\" is one of the best albums of all time(that should be expected since its the only Beatles double-album, and double albums always seem to be the best or amongst the best) and does a great job at showing musical diversity and strength in the same package. Some reviewers may say that the album should have been narrowed down to the best material and then released as one disc, but I disagree, for what makes this album so cool is that there were so many songs and each is so necessary. A single-disc \\"The Beatles\\" may have been stronger, but everything on the double-album is essential and great in its own right. Anyway, don't let the cost discourage you from this album, because it's worth every penny - just like all The Beatles' albums! Oh, and by the way, \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" may seem a bit wierd at first, but don't let that discourage you! And to all those who say it sucks, listen again closely and then tell me it sucks, and then if you still think it sucks you have no appreciation for good music.
B000002IZ4|4.0|While I didn't like it as much as I liked Core (just because I like hard rock) Purple is still an excellent album. The album has incredible variety, so much sometimes it's hard to tell the same band did all the songs.Here's a rundown of the tracks:<br />1.Meatplow, 9.Unglued, and 7.Silver gun-the most Core-ish songs here, and all rock.<br />2.Vaseline and 6.Pretty Penny-the most experimental tracks, but Vaseline sounds psychedelic while Pretty Penny almost sounds like a medieval-style ballad<br />3. Lounge Fly-really long and not my favorite, but it is the only STP song I know of with the &quot;F&quot; word.<br />4.Interstate Love Song and 8.Big Empty- the big singles, both have the kind of epic sound that &quot;Plush&quot; had.<br />5.Still Remains-I'm sure not everyone shares my opinion, but I hate this song.<br />10. Army Ants-one of my favs on Purple, and SW actually sounds a little like Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br />11. Kitchen Ware and Candy Bars- a silly name for a serious song, it's a good closer, but not my favorite.<br />Overall, excellent. More variety than a movie soundtrack, but not as hardcore as, well, &quot;Core&quot;.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Now I must admit that when I read Rickey Wright's review of &quot;Room for Squares&quot; I cheered to myself when I saw that he compared some of John Mayer's singing styles to Dave Matthews Band.  I had made that some comparison more than once, yet no one seemed to agree with me.  But, in the defense of all DMB fans, to compare one to the other does not make one lesser.  In fact, Mayer's style is one of the reasons I like him so much.  Also correct is that honesty is not something often heard on the radio waves lately.  Mayer is one of few and I'm glad that people like Wright do not discourage him in the slightest.  &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is definately an album that will stay in the CD player for quite some time.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|When I first heard this album I disliked it greatly. I was offended by some of its lyrics (\\"Holocaust aside many lived and died, but if the truth is told, would u rather b dead or b sold?\\" from Muse 2 the Pharaoh) and I was rather frustrated by the deep Darth Vader-like voice that narrates this concept album between songs.<br />It took me months to really explore this album, however. And yet the above things I mentioned still annoy me...except now I look past Prince's quirkiness to see an album that, whether many know it or not, signifies his ascension to a new form of music-making, free of mindless marketing, record company games, and overexposure.  ...<br />This album has a full, rich sound to it, and it has what most albums on the charts today lack - spirit.<br />I recommend this album to diehard fans and to casual fans with an open mind and a willingness to accept change - change for the good!
B0000399WI|4.0|When I first saw this film, I thought &quot; Whoa&quot;. How could anyone survive such awful treatment, and worse than that, having no one believe you. The actors ( Tim Robins, Morgan Freeman) do a superb job. They bring to life this neo-classic story. I was deeply moved by this motion picture, and the DVD brings the story to your own home. The bonus materials could be better, but the main part of the DVD is the actual movie. Great, great, great film... OK DVD...wonderful cast of actors... Good Buy!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|\\"The Beatles 1\\" is a fantastic set that not only has some of the greatest music of all time but also shows the evolution of The Beatles as a group and their style of music-making. Each track flows smoothly to the next and each sounds like it was meant to be on this collection. \\"Love Me Do\\" kicks it off perfectly but it skips their first #1 hit according to four magazines, \\"Please Please Me\\", but one disputed that (there was no one national chart and that's why it was a #1 to some and not to others) so that is excusable but the absense of the unanamous #1 hit and The Beatles' twenty-second (or twenty-third, it depends on if you count \\"Please Please Me\\" as their first) \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" is missed. \\"From Me To You\\", \\"She Loves You\\", and \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" (it is NOT \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" as many people say. I just wanted to make that clear :)) seem to be meant for each other but \\"Yesterday\\" seems to interrupt the flow of the album  because its speed but \\"Day Tripper\\" quickly causes you to forget about it and keep enjoying the fast-paced music. And while \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is slower, it seems to fit perfectly in after \\"Yellow Submarine\\". <br /> The superb \\"Penny Lane\\" sounds great in such a high sound quality as does \\"Hello Goodbye\\". \\"Lady Madonna is unique on this compilation because of its beat, but its still a great song. \\"Hey Jude\\", the \\"best song of the 60s\\", fits in perfectly with the rest despite its length. \\"The Ballad of John & Yoko\\" isn't really even a ballad (I mean ballad like \\"The Long And Winding Road\\"), but it works on the album just the same. \\"Something\\" is the only #1 hit by The Beatles written by George but its just as, if not more, beautiful than any other outstanding Beatles ballad. \\"Come Together\\" is another standout track that everyone knows for its chorus, but should know it for its complex lyrics. The last two tracks are among the best McCartney songs: \\"Let It Be\\", the single version with a different guitar solo that was not on the album version, is simply a beautiful masterpiece, and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is one of the best McCartney ballads of all time, though not quite as good as \\"Let It Be\\".<br /> Under no circumstances should any Beatles album be preffered over this unless you already own most of the tracks on this on other albums. This is a must-have for a beginning Beatles fan. In fact, this was my start to them, but I have since learned not to like compilations so much, but anyway the bottom line is:<BR>Get it!
B000002HRE|5.0|Just when I thought Metallica can't go any dumber after releasing Load, they release this - and totally redeem themselves.
B000067CPX|3.0|This album does have some good material.<BR>The problem (as with most band's mellow &quot;growth&quot; albums)<BR>is that the Chili Pepp's have made the mistake of <BR>stringing too many long stretches of mid to slow tempo<BR>songs together in the final track sequance.<BR>A situation which, at first listen really put me off of this album.<br />So, after a few listens I've finally come up with the following<BR>alternate track sequance. I'm not going to bother with song titles right now, I'll just suggest that fans program their track listing in this order:<br />Track # : 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 10, 6, 9, 8, 14, 11, 12, 13, 4, 15, 16.<br />I've found this running-order to be a much more enjoyable<BR>listening experiance, and I will write a full review after<BR>living with this sequance for a while longer.<br />Fave Tracks So Far:<br />Venice Queen<BR>On Mercury<BR>Universally Speaking (Love that groovy roller-rink synth bridge!)<BR>Minor Thing<br />-More later
B00004VW0W|5.0|I am a huge Cat Stevens fan, and I can't stop listening to this album. Foreigner Suite is sort of like Bohemian Rhapsody was to Queen and Italian Restuarant to Billy Joel. It is genius in its own way, and I can't get over the last part of the suite. &quot;Heaven mst've programmed you.&quot; The lyrics are amazing, this album is Cat at his finest.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This film was a lot better than I expected it to be. From the previews I expected a bloodier version of Tomb Raider. I was wrong. I have never played the game, or even seen it up close, but I must say that it was one of the better video game-to-movie adaptations I have seen to date. This one had an interesting plot unlike the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" style of video game movies in which everything from the game is attempted to be squeezed into the film and therefore some items are left out, including a plot sometimes.<br />The beginning is a little confusing, with everything going on at once. But after everything settles down and all is explained, the movie gets much better. The special effects were quite good, and the acting was convincing too, especially Jovovich and Rodriguez.<br />Maybe I was just dazzled by the film being better than my expectations, but I was entertained. I watched this film in a room full of people who were all interested by the end. So obviously I wasn't the only one.
0553103547|3.0|A good read, but horrible ending...<br />The Fire and Ice series as a good fantasy epic.  Interesting world building and characters that you love and some that you hate.  Always interesting when most of the \\"good guys\\" die.  All in all, these were bigs books with plenty of originality to keep a epic fantasy lover happy, but...<br />The series just ends after the third book with no resolution!  At lease with the wheel of time we get a new book every few years.  I don't know if Martin plans on finishing this series, but if he doesn't, well get ready to be disappointed.
0226264017|5.0|Friedman's critics and fellow travelers in the libertarian fold rightfully viewed Capitalism and Freedom as a landmark book in 1962.  The author brilliantly, if albeit briefly, articulated his theories of human behavior, which stood in contrast to the prevailing Keynesian ideology.  The book has stood the test of time, and has become a classic part of libertarian literature.  Like Marx's Das Kapital, the book has become a common point of reference for review in many college courses for members of the Left and the Right.<br />Some quick notes.  The book was not written as an exhaustive economics treatise that purported to evaluate every single possible component of economics.  Friedman did not present every single ideological permutation's view of price supports for farm products, as an example.  Anyone looking for Every Possible Libertarian Opinion on a Given Economic Question, much less the contrasting viewpoints of Marxists/Neo-Keynesians/Flat Earth Society proponents, will need to look elsewhere (Keynesian Paul Samuelson's classic work, \\"Economics\\", is recommended for as a starting point).  Friedman's reputation in the economics profession was not earned from this book, but his other works, especially his \\"Monetary History of the United States\\".<br />As for Paul Krugman's criticisms of Milton Friedman, the potential reader should heed the old axiom, \\"consider the source\\".  Krugman is a brilliant economist, who after being exposed for decades to a mass of information on the failings of government meddling in the economy, persistently recommends a watered down version of the same failed policies that didn't work in the past.  Interestingly enough, he belongs to that peculiar breed of economist who stridently defends \\"free\\" trade between nations, but somehow believes that individual entrepreneurs in a national economy require \\"guidance\\" from Big Brother (regulate, baby, regulate).  <br />Krugman, like many economists of all political preferences, carefully chooses data that conforms to his preconceived opinions (monetarism under Thatcher and the early Volker years in the US), while excluding any information that might challenge his assumptions.  Krugman fails to mention that in 1979, with 21% interest rates and 13.5% CPI in the US, his fellow Keynesians were recommending as a \\"cure\\" an increase in inflationary spending, higher marginal tax rates, and increased spending by the government.  Some cure.  Which is exactly why so many people anxiously embraced the monetarist creed at the time.  Equally bogus is his claim that Volker's altered policies in the mid-1980s were a reversion to Keynesian monetary doctrine.  Krugman's analysis of supply-side economics, which Friedman never supported, contains many of the same \\"ignore the facts\\" approach.<br />Final note.  Many of the same economists who criticize Friedman for his lack of intellectual rigor slam Robert Lucas, another University of Chicago Nobel Prize Winner, for being too rigorous and dependent on advanced mathematical models that don't reflect the \\"real world\\".
B00004SCX6|3.0|This album was, more or less, a recreation of the debut, from the title all the way to the songs. <br />\\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" more or less was structured the way \\"...Baby\\" was. But the song is good, and the hit it deserved to be. B<br />\\"Stronger\\" was probably the best song melodically. Catchy tune and had a very good message, if perhaps a tad overdone. A-<br />\\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" is okay, but don't really get the point of it. B-<br />\\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" is once again an unneccessary cover song. But I have to say it was good and not bad on the ears. B<br />\\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" is a sweet little song. Nothing more, nothing less. B-<br />\\"What U See (Is What You Get)\\" is a good song. The melody is catchy and should have been released instead of the song before it. B+<br />\\"Lucky\\" is my favorite song on the album. Perhaps has the deepest message, even though, like \\"Stronger\\", has been said and done over and over. A-<br />\\"One Kiss From You\\" is a good song on the album. Just a simple love song, which is something that everyone can relate to. B+<br />\\"Where Are You Now\\" is very sweet as well. Easy to put yourself in the first person role of this song. B+<br />\\"Can't Make You Love Me\\" is okay, but just has no point to it. C+<br />\\"When You Eyes Say It\\" is incredibly sweet. A good love song, and catchy enough. B+<br />\\"Dear Diary\\" just plain sucks. D  <br />All in all, this album has a few gems, but it's mostly forgettable. It can't decide if the point is that Britney is \\"Stronger\\" or that she wants to give advice to the world, or that she wants to focus on ballads. A little too uneven, and more or less the same from before.
0783225970|5.0|I gave this move a 5 rating,because i think this movie is the best movie that Pacino has worked on. I feel that Scarface is the best movie ever made about the subject it talks about. And its just a classic gangster movie. Every one who likes movies should watch this movie because its one of the best movies ever. The first time I seen this movie i felt in love with it and i just had to watch it again and again. This movie perfectly describes the life of a Cuban refugee who started at the bottom of the mountain,but as time passed he started moving up on the mountain and finally reached the top. Tony Montana did stuff his own way never taking nothing from nobody and always doing what he thought was right. But at the end doing stuff his own way cought up to him and he lost all he ever loved his sister and his own life. I really recommend this movie because I think its the the best.
0446608955|4.0|Okay, so I've read more brilliant writing; but Sparks has weaved a classic love-tragedy story. I am a hopeless romantic, and I melt at this stuff. So obviously I couldn't put it down. I knew the ending reading it, but I hadn't seen the movie, which helped a lot. I still haven't seen it, but from reading descriptions of it, and seeing pictures, I can pretty accurately assume that they changed each and every detail- from the way Landon ends up in the school play to the color of Jamie's hair (no, it's not brown, folks). The book was a very simple yet heartfelt love story, and I enjoyed reading it.

I hope he does better than the other two and actually advanced the plot line in each book.  Seems that Jordan and Goodkind are just milking their franchises.
B000059HAI|2.0|Ever wonder why hollywood directors take so many liberties when making a war movie?  In my opinion, this film provides a more than adequate answer. <br />Granted, the attack scene is very well executed, with special effects that are impressive even today.   But the rest of the film is dry and soulless. The characters spout dialogue that sounds like it was taken out of a college history textbook word for word.   <br />If you want an impressive factual account of Dec. 7 and the preceeding events, then check out the two DVD History Channel documentary.  If you want to see an entertaining Pearl Harbor film that is true to the essence of the 1940's, see Michail Bay's Pearl Harbor.  <br />Of course, if you fall in between those two extremes, then Tora Tora Tora just might be the one for you.
0380977788|5.0|Being a huge fan of Neil Gaiman (which my boyfriend says is nerdy, but i don't care) for years... i got this book as soon as i heard about it. \\"Neverwhere\\" and \\"Stardust\\" are both incredibly magical adult fairy tales. The \\"Sandman\\" graphic novel series is legendary in its genre. And \\"American Gods\\" was an amazing epic.... it just went on and on, with interweaving plots and characters.<BR>\\"Coraline\\" is  a very sweet, simple, Alice-in-Wonderland type tale. It seems like it should be a short story, but keeps going!<br />It's sweet, dark, fun, beautiful.... <br />The limited edition version has notes and drawings in the back by Neil Gaiman - worth the extra money!
B00001P4RI|5.0|I, too, was very sad that DCD parted ways.  At least Lisa and Brendan are still making music!  Beautiful music.  So they parted?  Brendan's music is like the Sun and Lisa'a is like the Moon.  When they are together it is an Eclipse.  Maybe one day we will get to see that eclipse again.  Until then, feast your ears upon Brendan's first solo album since DCD parted.  It took me a little time to get used to half of the songs on this CD.  He has a Gothic Western sound.  I don't like Western music, but this grew on me.  I can only compare it to the sound of the Cowboy Junkies.  The rest of the songs are pure magic.  Songs like Medusa and Archangel will make the hair on your arms stand up as you are transported into those worlds that only a true musical bard can send you.  Very good!
B00000DGRX|3.0|Billboard liked this one.  So did the masses of teenies into the Purple at the time.  I personally think they gave something up and compromised.  Fireball rocked a lot harder...  Machine Head seemed a bit too formulated.  But it is DP during that period.  Both Machine Head and Fireball have been remastered with additional cuts added, for the most part, on separate discs.  It's a great package...  I think Roger Glover spearheaded the efforts and I highly commend him for his great gift to the fans.  Thanks... enjoy.
0151008116|4.0|At first, I found Life of Pi funny and magical. Pi Patel, the narrator of the novel, is such a substantially articulated narrative voice that, despite his occasional didactics, is utterly his own, separated from any weight of authorial overbearance on Yann Martel's part. Thus, when, at moments when Pi seems awkwardly polemical (particularly some of his clever, but not necessarily revelatory comments about religion and animal life) it seems to be simply, quintessentially Pi, not a sermonizing by Martel as the author of the book. After a while, however, it becomes obvious that Martel is attempting to allegorize certain issues of faith, freedom, and the truth of God and the world against the truths that we understand, and this obviousness, I found, verges on being a distractiion to the novel's power. The moment when I began to doubt, though, was the precise moment when Pi finds himself shipwrecked on a 26-foot lifeboat with Richard Parker, a 10-foot(or somewhere around there) Bengal tiger. The section of the book that details Pi's life at sea, perfectly counteracted any doubts I had, as Martel steers away from the unengaging, not particularly astounding philosophical and religious insights to allow these issues to speak underneath and through the narrative. Pi's struggle for survival, visited in places by his consideration of what he observes, speaks much more powerfully than his earlier mere statements. <br />Though not particularly poetic, there is a quality in Martel's writing, in Pi's voice, that is simply amazed, wondering at the breadth of marvel and danger in the world around him. In a way, it is the bare exposure of what he witnesses, his actual experience of natural beauty, that reveals danger; to know it is to know his place in it, to see and grasp his own death. Therefore, there is a terric, plainspoken lyricism to Life Of Pi. Pi's sense of awe is perhaps my favorite part of the book, because it is subtle and, through Pi's utterly convincing voice, true.<br/>Finally, Martel saves the best for last, and I won't give it away, though I will say that the end of Life Of Pi awakens Pi's character even further into my mind. He is more palpable as the truth of his life becomes more ambiguous and textured. Life Of Pi is thus a magical book that may reach a little in places, but, on the exuberant whole, is excellent and fraught with wonder.
0393976041|5.0|The story is timeless. Therefore I won't be reviewing the text as it were. But I felt it necessary to remark on this particular version of *Pride and Prejudice*.<br />The Norton Critical Editions are generally favored among academic communities because they offer biographic information, notes on language, and other essays regarding the novel along with the text itself. In a way, it's a more acceptable version of cliffs notes.<br />The extras offered in the Norton edition of *Pride and Prejudice* are some of the best that I've seen in the series. It gives an account of Austen from quite a few of her biographers, includes letters between the author and her family and friends, and also offers critical analysis of themes in the novel. And if that's not enough, it gives one better. An interview with Colin Firth, the man who brought Darcy to life in the BBC film adaptation, that was first published in the somewhat hard to find book on the making of the film.<br />For those that have yet to read Austen's *Pride and Prejudice,* this is a wonderful version to start with. In case you find yourself struggling with the language it provides a definition or a more accessible word. The essays as well help to bring the characters to light. Plus, for those that have seen the film version and wish to read the book again(or for the first time)this is a must if for the Firth interview alone. This is a nice, solid book that just feels good in hand.
B000006NXP|5.0|The legendary Brahms 4th Symphony by Kleiber is a far cry as to its status being an \\"Epic Symphony.\\" Anyone with deep enough pocket can now reach for the Kleiber's Brahms. Far short of being demonic Kleiber's utter outrage and intellectual dilemma is evidenced in the context of Brahms the Bach student, rather than a Brahms the misnomer of \\"classical studies.\\" <br />It is not fair, and I was prompted to say, as soon as the first movement has ended, \\"Brahms,\\"\\"Brahms don't push it.\\" It is natural for anyone to question composer's mental faculties as well as moral ones: I can't imagine anything else being left untouched. First movement sounds and feels like the entire symphony, rather than just one movement. I thought the DG has given no interval and Kleiber wanted to be heard this way. Pretty daunting! The epic journey of the first movement is so complete and I cannot imagine, after all this, there could be anything more, even if it means embellishing beyond the mental closure every corner of a dramatic turns render sense dumb with a pouring sweat. The trademark \\"a blood of the massed string\\" of Brahms' renders the dullest sense and piercing through the blush leaves no emotion unearthed. I really saw the epic history bottoming out. I wondered what more could possibly be pulled by this combination: \\"Brahms-Kleiber.\\"<br />Second movement too-though far \\"silent\\"-placates but affords no loose wire. Kleiber's control of the orchestra checks and balances moral evidence felt in degrees that is the offshoot of an unbalance. I doubt the atomic assault can be mitigated by carpet bombing. But the way the silence annihilates even the brief repose can dance about its periphery as being morally insane clouds bumped by the under and overestimating winds. <br />Third movement is by no means a surprise. Brahms attacks even at the first bar with laughing humor. He is never silent about how to put into effect a comedy. But this agreeable peevishness goes beyond the approaching seriousness and perhaps tragedy. As soon so as the horn section interjects, closing the end bars, the tone shifts.<br />Fourth movement is a blood thirsty beast. I am too busy now thinking about me jumping up and down almost simulating the posture of mad conductor. I found my limb everywhere tossed about in the air, and my feet, kicking and menacing, finally culminated in an ocean of epic flood of sweat.
6305313687|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which for some reason I thought was going to be an action flick. Instead, I found a socially powerful, gripping film. The theme isn't new but the sympathetic (but not condoning) treatment of Neo-nazis/skinheads was refreshing. It's not an easy movie to watch, but I'm glad I did, and hope to see it again soon. Edward Norton once again proves that he is a fine actor.
0553260111|5.0|I read the book prior to the movie and decided to read it again after seeing it.  I have read this one and the Bourne Ultimatum they are both great.  Ludlum does an excellent job of telling you what the character is thinking.  Brilliant spy novelist Mr. Ludlum.<br />For all those looking for another of his great books, The Matarese Circle is my favorite.

0971855110|5.0|I disagree with the &quot;Reader from MA&quot; July 9, 2002 whose title reads &quot;Only for the seriously sloppy.&quot;  My wife of 42 years has only one serious hobby: CLEANING. She is never happier than when she finds something to clean. When we visit our daughters, she goes right to work, starting out with cleaning the refrigerator. There is only one book in this world she has found to be useful, and that book is SINK REFLECTIONS. The first tip was to wear lace shoes in the house. She tried it. It worked!<br />The real reason the reader from MA is disgruntled is that the author dares to mention God in her book. Who else better to mention? The laws of cleanliness date back to the law given to Moses, do they not?<br />I am a selling author, currently working on a new book about making things happen. In each chapter, I recommend a book. In Chapter One, that book will be SINK REFLECTIONS.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|The visual effects, sets, costumes, and time travel sequences are really what makes this movie worthwhile. Forget about the slack dialogue and the storyline infused with trite left-wing propaganda.
B000068QY7|5.0|Heathen Chemistry<BR>Overall is a great album, and was much needed in Rock 'n' Roll.  It gives you hope that Rock 'n' Roll is still here.  As every album from this great band, this one is filled with a different but still Oasis sound.  From the First track till the last note sustained throughout the recording is listenable.......which is very hard to find nowadays.  I suggest it to any Oasis fan, and anyone who needs a change from the bands that are out there today.
B0000640VN|2.0|Hey, I love Meg Ryan and I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and that Hugh Jackman--hubba hubba.  So this movie started off as a 5-star movie for me.  The action-oriented beginning of the movie fulfilled my expectations as the Duke of Albany, Leopold, notices that he is being observed by a stranger (Liev Schreiber) who accidentally pulls the Duke forward into present day New York.  Schreiber's ex-girlfriend Kate then enters the picture.  From that point on, the movie slides slowly into Schmaltzville, stopping by Yawn Valley on its way.<br />Meg Ryan is miscast as Kate, a woman who \\"doesn't do pretty\\" but does do rude.  For the life of me, even as big a Meg Ryan fan as I am, I can't figure out how or why Leopold would fall for her.  Jackman's magnetism on-screen is undeniable and his dialogue half-interesting, but he can't pull off the fiction that he would find his true love in this invulnerable straw-haired unwomanly person.  Schreiber, who is the most interesting person to watch in this movie, disappears from view about a third of the way in and doesn't reappear until after an hour of watching Kate and Leopold try to convince the audience that they've fallen in love.<br />My recommendation:  an okay way to kill a couple of hours, but fast forward through Kate and Leopold's requisite Saturday afternoon date montage and subsequent sleep-inducing deep talk.
0449002128|5.0|Daniel Silva is rapidly becoming the leading writer of thriller/espionage fiction in the U.S.  Case in point is \\"The Kill Artist\\".  Silva takes a well worn formula:  a former operative leaves the business to pursue a new career ( in this case, a restorer of paintings ) but he is drawn back in by a former supervisor who teams him up with a former female agent with whom he has previously worked with and had an affair. Yet, with Silva's style and his economy of writing, it is as if we are treading on new ground.  Gabriel Allon is the art restorer ( the \\"kill artist\\" of the title) and former Israeli operative; Ari Shamron, his former boss ( imagine Ariel Sharon in a bombadier jacket); and Jacqueline Delacroix, nee Sarah Halevy, the grandaughter of Sobibor victims and a current fashion model but former Israeli secret agent, comprise this triddium.  When current Palestinian bad guy and super assassin Tariq \\"offs\\" some Israeli officials in Paris, Shamron puts the wheels in motion to bring Gabriel back in the game for one more mission.  Tariq had planted a car bomb under Gabriel's family, so revenge becomes the dish best served cold.<br />Silva takes us across three continents as the chess match pitting Gabriel against Tariq unfolds.  From the middle east to Paris and London to Montreal and New York, we see each move, each gambit.  Yet, Silva also takes time to explain how Gabriel, Jacqueline, and Tariq become who they are and how they get to their roles in this game.  Fans of Silva's \\"The Marching Season\\" will also recognize President James Beckwith and Ambassador Douglas Cannon.<br />Despite, every now and then, slipping in a sentence that doesn't make sense, Silva still gives us a good run.  For example, Tariq is a hard nosed killer, yet Silva states that he \\"didn't have the stomach\\" for hitting Jacqueline in the face with a gun. Such minor gaffs should be overlooked in the grand scheme of a good story that really moves from chapter to chapter.  The ending isn't quite what you would expect from a \\"normal\\" thriller and, even though the book ends right where it begins, nothing is quite as it seems.  I understand that Gabriel returns in Silva's next novel.  I can't wait.
B00005QXDD|1.0|fat black needs to go away already.  he's not that funny, not that talented--he should go back to playing college coffeehouses.  or better yet, jump off a bridge.<br />this &quot;music&quot; is about as much fun as sandpaper between the legs, and the comedy is as funny as a kid telling jokes at a bar mitzvah.<br />actually, that's funny.
B00005QXDD|5.0|'And the peculiar thing is this my friends:: the song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound anything like this song!'' I'm continually amazed by the combination of comedy and musicality on this album. I'm a fan of comedy albums to begin with (Adam Sandler's efforts spring to mind), but they tend to wear thing once I've memorized the jokes. This album's music manages to keep it out of that particular used bin; even once the skit-comedy bits have worn thin, the music's incredible hooks and great harmony keep you coming back. JB and KG have just earned another devoted fan. I suggest that you give this album the chance it deserves.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is perhaps the most _un_-Disneylike Disney kid's movie, in that many gags and takes remind one of the WB/MGM shorts of the 1930s to the 1950s, in the vein of Bob Clampett, Chuck jones and \\"Tex\\" Avery.<br />This is not a bad thing, really- This was wonderfully executed by the guys at Pixar that certainl.y give more than a wink and a nod to the greats, and deserves all the kudos it deserved for its theatrical release, and no doubt the forthcoming DVD release will earn more raves... and certainly more bucks for the coffers of both Disney and Pixar, especially at a time where there has been strainjs between the two companies.<br />I'll let everyone else give their synopses of the movie, and just say: Buy it, you won't regret it. :)
B0000668IF|4.0|I was thinking that I didn't like the new Moby CD much, but it simply turns out that I wasn't listening to it at the right time. This is a CD for the quiet times at night (probably like the ones where he stayed up in his studio creating said album), when everybody else in the house but you is asleep. Yes, there are fast grooves like &quot;Jam for the Ladies&quot; (which I think would have been a better first single than &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;), but it is predominated by introspective, almost melancholy songs, such as &quot;Great Escape&quot; and &quot;At Least We Tried&quot; (with heartbreakingly beautiful vocals by Freedom Bremmer). This is not the same record that Play was, and one should not expect it to be. Consider it in context with Moby's previous CD if you must, but treat the album as its own entity.
0553381709|5.0|With a complex weave of fantasy and reality, George Martin continues to write this stunning series with an amount of depth and attention to character that I can't remember seeing recently in any high fantasy series. He continues on with his brutal look at a realistic world where no man or woman is spared from the bad things in life.<br />Characters are so believeable in their creation with a heavy dose of flaws and range of emotion. The look at the world as a whole and lands outside of the main continent are terrific giving the whole tale a mighty scope that only whets your appetite for more.<br />This third book finally starts to bring in the more magical aspects of the universe with subtlety and then smacks you over the head with a couple of stunning twists. The great thing is that the magic doesn't overshadow the deadly court intrigue and human wars, but mingles with it so perfectly that it seems very natural for it to be included.<br />Unfortunately I see that the next book isn't going to be released for over a year! I don't know that I can hold out that long to find out what's going to happen next. I can't say enough positive things about this series. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys reading, not just those fantasy geeks like myself. It's a very fulfilling ride that just gets better with each page. <br />Another Great book is The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock The book has a complex weave of fantasy and reality that you will not believe
0780627016|2.0|About half way through the movie, I turned to my mother and thanked her for renting it- I would have hated to spend the money on it myself.<br />The overwhelming theme of the movie is the need to imbrace change, and the director never misses a chance to hit you over the head with it.
B000066NW0|5.0|it's a wicked cd full of heartfelt songs and a chick with attitude. like many of you out there i was unsure about buying this but afterward i was very pleased with it. definately the best this year (in my opinion). also take note this is not another grueling bubblegum pop cd...this is a little thing i like to call \\"music\\" not \\"bubblegum pop\\"...
B000068PQ0|5.0|to tell you the truth, i first heard the lips when they had their fluke hit \\"she don't use jelly\\" in 1993.  that turned me off, immediately.  i was sure that it was the dumbest song i'd heard that year.<br />almost a decade later, the flaming lips are one of my favorite bands. up there with yo la tengo, pavement, modest mouse, and other indie favorites. i'd even venture to say that they are on par with the beatles and the velvet underground [to me only. let's not get hysterical].<br />they have an extensive catalog [dating back to 1985], so it can be a little intimidating knowing where to start.  my advice is to start with any of the albums from \\"transmission from the satellite heart\\" to the more current [skip zaireeka for now].  <br />that leaves only four albums, which are all MUST HAVES. within those four, \\"yoshimi\\" is a great place to start.  it isn't the masterpiece that \\"soft bulletin\\" is/was, but it certainly is a more consistent and satisfying record, though the best songs on soft bulletin are superior. yoshimi is a loose concept record about a japanese girl battling evil robots [but you knew that already from the cover art].<br />if you're thinking that they couldn't possibly have made another great record... have no fear.  <br />i've listened to over 200 new albums this year, and i'll listen to another 200 or so by year's end. i'm CERTAIN that this will be at the top of the list when december 31st rolls around.
B000002U8G|5.0|Arguably one of their greatest albums, a must have for any Pink Floyd music fan.  Most of Floyd's albums set a mood or at least have a consistent theme, (Syd Barrett in Wish You Where Here, Cosmos in Saucerful Of Secrets, ect..) but Meddle never seems to accomplish this, which by no means correlates to the excellence of the album.  Meddle opens with the frightening power of One Of These Days, then almost turning a full 180 degrees with A Pillow Of Winds, a peaceful and blissful track, then a lyrical showing of Roger Waters in Fearless, followed by the tropical sound of San Tropez (barefoot, grapefruit, sunshine and palm trees come to mind almost instantly, and remember it is Pink Floyd!), the quaint bluesy Seamus, and finally the greatest Pink Floyd song, the epic Echoes.  This song no doubt show the \\"all star\\" abilities of the band all in one song, the chilling keyboards of Wright, the lead vocals and pulsating bass guitar of Waters, cadence of the percussion by Mason, and in the final moments of this epic, the commanding guitar of Gilmour.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold is a wonderful book.  The best I have read in a long time.  Within the first few pages I was already hooked.  The authors ability to create a story like this one amazed me.  It was amazing.  The plot is wonderful and sad at the same time as it was sometimes funny.  It follows a love story, a mother lost in her ability to deal with death, a young brother who cant quite understand, a father who is dealing with her death one step at a time, a love interest who misses her and is blamed for her death, and a good friend who is bent on the fact that she passes her near a soccer field.  Ane the main character Susie who watches the whole story unfold after her death, in her heaven.
0790729628|5.0|Even after 20 years this is a film that dystopic scifi has to compete against. New films are still compared to it - Minority Report, for example. It was stunning in the cinema, amazing to revisit it on DVD. But now, surely it is time to amaze us again with an anniversary edition, complete with respectable extras - commentary, background etc. If a dire film like Pearl Harbor is worth multiple editions, then this is long overdue for its definitive DVD.<br />Interestingly, after Sonny Chow (see above) saying that the Special Edition is due in 2003, Amazon.co.uk has a new edition being released on August 12 2002. No details though. Is it the special edition?
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah Carey was at her peak on this album. Every song is fantastic and has amazing vocals. My favorites are I Am Free, When I Saw You, and Forever. I love her classic hits (Fantasy, One Sweet Day, and Always Be My Baby) but I really enjoy listening to the lesser known songs. This album is a mixture of rhythym and blues and soft pop, and it provides for great listening. Lyrically these aren't great songs, but her breath taking voice makes up for it majorly. Hands down this is Mariah's best album, and a true definition of the nineties. Buy it.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Ok by now most of you readers know what this film is about. In case you don't it is about a virus which is unleased into an underground corportion called the Hive. It mutates the employees turning them into zombies...Commandos go in...fight..gt eaten...etc... Anyway. Those of you who enjoy the game will love the movie. Just don't get to attached to any of the charactors. Especially the ones who enter the dreaded laser hallway. The Hallway seen is the best scene in any movie ever.  If you dont like Resident Evil just watch it for that scene, which is like 15 minutes into the movie. The movie had everything a Resident Evil fan could have. I only wish Mr.X was in it. Rumors have it he's in the next film.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller provides such a refreshing sound as opposed to Michael's new, angrier, more intense music. Don't get me wrong, I may be his biggest fan, but it is nice to pop in this CD and hear his innocence. Let the reviewing begin.<br />1. Wanna Be Startin Somethin- This track is an obvious hit, it has a cool African beat and chant, and Michael does some interesting vocals.<br />2. Baby Be Mine- A suprising discovery on this album. I really really enjoy this song. It is so completely soul and groovy. Michael goes all out on this one.<br />3. The Girl Is Mine- Cute, sweet, innocent, a fantastic collaboration between possibly the two best musicians on this earth.<br />4. Thriller- Great effects, great \\"rap\\" by Vincent Price, and great vocals by the NOT SELF-PROCLAIMED King of Pop. This song is thrilling and nostalgic.<br />5. Beat It- A classic rock song of the eighties. This song foreshadows all of Michael Jackson's great variety of music. Incidentally, I love the dancing on this video.<br />6. Billie Jean- No matter how much I hear this song (and I've heard it A LOT) I can't get tired of it. It is all-around a perfect song. The beat, the lyrics, the vocals, the dance moves. One of his best ever.<br />7. Human Nature- This is my favorite on the album, if I must choose. I absolutely love every second of it. It's sexy yet innocent (I think I'm going to overuse this word). This song is mysterious, and it gets all of your senses going. Listen to it loudly.<br />8. P.Y.T.- My second favorite. It's so groovy and youthful. The beat and vocals make your shoulders move and your feet tap. It helps to know that Janet is a background singer.<br />9. The Lady In My Life- I didn't like this song as much as the others at first. But then I was reading Jackson's biography, and I read what he said about this song. Quincy Jones told him to \\"beg\\" on it. So he had the lights turned off so no one could see him (he was embarrassed), and he \\"begged.\\" So I listened for the begging, and it's there. I now love this song.<br />That concludes the original length of the album. Next we have commentary and bonus tracks.<br />10. Quincy talks about Someone In The Dark (a song on the ET Storybook) and how busy that time was.<br />11. Someone In The Dark- This is a sweet, loving, innocent (sorry) song. Michael's inner child shines through in the song. ET makes a guest appearance.<br />12. Quincy talks about the role of the producer, and about several of the hits on the album.<br />13. This track is the home demo of Billie Jean. The lyrics aren't finalized, or even close to the finished product. This is a really interesting look at what happens to prepare for an album.<br />14. Quincy talks about Beat It in detail, and MTV.<br />15. Rod Temperton talks about Vincent Price's role in Thriller.<br />16. Quincy talks about Vincent Price.<br />17. Behind the scenes of the voice-over session with Michael and Vincent. You also hear the never before released 2nd verse of the \\"rap.\\"<br />18. Rod Temperton talks about Carousel, a track recorded, but not kept on the final album.<br />19. Quincy talks about Carousel.<br />20. Carousel- An almost sickly sweet song about a girl from a different kind of world. He pulls it off though.<br />21. Quincy Jones says his final thoughts on Thriller.<br />This is an amazing album. The added commentary and tracks are sooooo interesting. And the first nine tracks are in tact, they're beautiful, and they're sung and mainly written by an amazing artist. Buy this album, it is the best selling one, shouldn't everyone own it?
0767020308|4.0|Finally having watched all 3 &quot;Emma&quot;, I am quite sure that all 3 versions have had qualities that one might hope to find in movies in differnet time and mind setting:<BR>Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma is more humoruos/comical quite excellent for a good laugh--Jeremy Northam and Gwyneth Paltrow make a perfect charming couple--. NOw for JA's Emma, it is much more a drama than a comedy and I found intense and strong chemistery between Mark Strong and Kate Beckinsale. Both couples in both &quot;Emma&quot; carry the show perfectly well. All other characters in JA's Emma show more deep of emotions, if you wish.<BR>It is just up to your mood and what you are looking for any particular time while you are watching Emma: So; take your pick accordingly(I myself planning to get both Emma, they both are really charming and interesting in their own way; no need to say I ma a fanatic of JA's work on TV and big screen)<BR>But I have one strong recommendation for &quot;Emma&quot; lovers: go and rent(if you haven't done yet) &quot;Emma&quot; of 1972 BBC version on Video.<BR>Doran Goodwin is the best and most charming Emma I have watched by now. Together with John Carson who brought an excellent Mr. Knightley on TV, Ms. Goodwin's Emma is more succesfull than others IMO; I wish we could have 1972 Emma on DVD too, any chance?
B000002LCK|5.0|Its pretty simple. If you don't own \\"Substance 1987\\" go buy it right now. If you are a New Order or Joy Division fan, or just simply a fan of great music, this CD should be in your collection. For me, the highlight of this disc is a new version of \\"Bizarre Love Triangle.\\" The original version found on Brotherhood and the remix found on the Greatest Hits CD are both good, but they don't compare to Substance's. Found here, \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" is almost three minutes longer than the other versions and features a cleaner, more upbeat sound. This song is gorgeous and is what made me fall in love with New Order in the first place. (It also reminds me of my first girlfriend...) However, this is by no means the only reason to buy Substance. The recordings of \\"True Faith\\" and \\"Perfect Kiss\\" are not exclusive to this disc but are still outstanding songs. \\"Temptation\\" is another standout, and \\"Blue Monday\\", probably New Order's most popular song, is also featured here. \\"Ceremony\\" is another song worth noting. Originally written by Joy Division although not released until the Heart and Soul box set, New Order's version is actually far better than Joy Division's. Sung in Barney Sumners' patented monotone, this is one of the most haunting and melodic songs ever recorded by either band. Disc Two, which features remixes like \\"The Beach\\", an instrumental version of \\"Blue Monday\\", and \\"The Kiss of Death\\", a remix of \\"The Perfect Kiss\\", as well as B-Sides, still has some amazing moments. The entire two-disc set is worth buying just for \\"In a Lonely Place\\". This chilling song was another song originally written by Joy Division but was never fully recorded. Disturbing, unnerving, and amazing. You owe it to yourself to get this CD.
0345448898|5.0|This trilogy is one of my favorite series, along with Madeleine L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time Series, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter  Series, Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern series, and Tolkien's books; but do not compare them, they are all very different, and written for different audiences. Having spoken to an acquaintance of the author's, I believe (from his comments) that these books were written for an older audience- adults, even, though you would not guess it from the beautifully illustrated covers. The stories become progressively darker and more complicated, and I believe there is quite a bit of symbolism. Before writing these books off as anti-religious, I would read them with a \\"Great Books\\" view- why did he use this... or have this character say or do... . I would really be interested in hearing Philip Pullman discuss these books. I have read the series three times, and have enjoyed the books more each time.
0060931671|5.0|Through the use of deep reflection and mind-altering substances, I came to a Zen-like understanding of this book and used that understanding to write a brilliant paper on it. My knowledge of \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is infinite and all encompassing. Although Pynchon dismisses this book in his introduction to \\"Slow Learner\\" and critics have said that this book does not compare to either \\"V\\" or \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", it is still a definitive postmodern text and far easier to read than a text like \\"Rainbow\\". Thanks to the short length and linear plot, readers should not have the same problems with \\"Lot 49\\" they may have had with \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\". The apparent readability of this text belies its complex nature, however. Through his use of dense language, intricate symbiotics, and an ambiguity on the plot level, Pynchon articulates a multiplicity of meaning that allows an incredibly diverse array of textual interpretations. When the main character, Oedipa Maas, wonders, \\"Shall I project a world?\\" she speaks for anyone who has attempted to sort through this novel. For any reader looking for a challenging and thought-provoking book who does not want to sort through 760 pages of \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" I would highly recommend this book.
B00005NGZX|5.0|This cd is a masterpiece!!! Words cannot even begin to describe how great this cd is! At first when i got it, i liked it a lot, but didn't really appreciate it enough, but after listening to it, it became my FAVORITE CD BY ANY BAND! This band is soley responsible for getting me into the crazy metal/hardcore stuff, like Cave In, Burnt by the Sun, and The Dillenger Escape Plan (even though dillenger isn't really metal/hardcore, it is like an even more insane version of converge, and is my 2nd favorite cd ever). So if you enjoy anykind of music that has insane riffs and violent and emotional singing, and even if you don't, YOU MUST GET THIS CD! I salute all who have this cd and appreciate it's brilliance, and am eagerly anticipating their new cd!
B00005QXDD|4.0|A riotous mix of Jack Black's witty humor and clever song writing, Tenacious D truly is a CD worth buying if you are looking for laughs. \\"One Note Song\\", \\"Hard ****ing\\", \\"Inward Singing\\", \\"**** Pushups\\", \\"Friendship Test\\", \\"Karate Schnitzel\\" and \\"Drive-Thru\\" indulge listeners with various skits in between serenades which are equally entertaining with uncouth rhyming and explicit content. If you aren't into swearing or two dudes crooning over balling discreetly, then steer clear.
B00005M1CO|5.0|If your a Blind Guardian, Iced Earth, and/or Nightwish fan, you should definitly check Elvenking out. This CD is excellent to say the very least, the songs get embedded into your head. Really, to sum this up.. Elvenking is definitly worth checking out.. I highly recommend it!! If your into Power Metal, and have not heard this awesome band out yet, what are you waiting for?
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Whenever I'm in my car, I blast this baby from the cheep stereo installed and croon equally as loud. While the movie is simply magnificent, it is decorated amazing with a list of songs that make you want to find love. <BR>Ewan serenades \\"Your Song\\" beautifully and vocally mixing with Nicole in \\"Elephant Love Melody\\" &amp; \\"Come What May\\" leaves listeners hard to believe that they sang every note rendered. <BR>He's hot, she's hot, they sound hot, buy this CD!
B00005JLDW|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. The special effects were awesome.  I think it was a little too technical trying to explain the dragon, and the procreation speed is unbelievable as well as humanity's response as a whole, but the dragons are cool and the efforts shown to defeat them equally impressive.  I think the movie could have been longer, and there could have been more character development, but it was certainly worth the matinee price and the movie does benefit from the big screen.
B000063DIR|1.0|I have been listening to Diary of a Madman for the last couple of days (the REAL ONE) and am STILL in awe, my favorite recording of all time (S.A.T.O.!!). Even within the 30 second snippets of this remastered/remixed TRASH I can tell it is practically HERESY. To tone down Randy and replace Daisley is like a knife straight through my heart. I wonder rather walk in and find my g/f with another guy than purchase or support this mess. Hopefully they hear our cries. I wonder what Delores \\"Dee\\" Rhoads thinks of this petty back-biting?
6300251616|3.0|Yeah, it's a campy sci-fi film.  Follow it during a double-feature evening with Repo-Man, and you'll be fine.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King knows how to engross you in a novel like no one else.  He knows how to take you into a character's mind and keep you prisoner there until you're begging for mercy.  He knows how to frighten you with his other-worldly (and sometimes too-real) villains.  He knows how to keep you up until the wee hours of the morning turning the pages.<br />Now he does it with non-fiction.<br />&quot;On Writing&quot; is, in my opinion (and that of many, many others) the best damn book on writing that ever existed.  But don't for a minute be turned off by the fact that this isn't a novel; King's done this before (&quot;Danse Macabre&quot;) and still has the knack.  However, unlike the afore mentioned book, &quot;On Writing&quot; does not stay in the horror genre; King knows that there are fans of other genres that will read this, and tells it in a way that all can understand.<br />The first part of this book is a minor autobiography.  It is not meant to be that way, but it is.  You get snapshots of King's life, of why he writes the way he does.  You will laugh, you will worry, and you will cry.  That is his intent.  King does this for a living, remember.<br />The second part of the book is, no pun intended, on writing.  King will go into  subjects such as grammar and editing, things that we all yawn at when we hear them in normal life.  But this, people, is not normal life: this is Stephen King's life.  He will captivate you with his vivid descriptions of adverbs (my favorite being &quot;Rocks explode, Jane transmits, mountains float, and plums deify.&quot;)  He will astound you while he's comparing/contasting works of literature.<br />Make no mistake: Stephen King knows what he's doing with this book.  And what is that, you ask?  Why, he's teaching you!  But &quot;On Writing&quot; is a perfect example of how school doesn't always have to be boring.
B0000013GT|5.0|\\"ATLiens\\" starts off with a woman singing a brief interlude, this perfectly sets up OutKast's second music masterpiece as this is not your typical album. It is a great mixture of rapping, singing, and the use of instrumentation that few albums dare to use.<BR>\\"Two Dope Boys\\" has a funky southern beat as OutKast bring some pimped out rhymes. \\"ATLiens\\" uses a great drum kick beat, with synthed singing in the background. This has one of the most memorable hooks of any rap song. OutKast shows off their ability to make meaningful songs with relaxing beats on \\"Jazzy Belle\\" and \\"Elevators\\". \\"Babylon\\" is simply amazing, OutKast shows off a new flow and uses a great hook to move the song along. \\"Mainstream\\" has a nice relaxed old-school feel that conjures up images of the beginnings of hip-hop. A common theme throughout this album is amazing hooks that really move the song and provide the elements that make good songs great. A nice example of this is on \\"Millennium\\" as this simple hook can be extremely effective. \\"13th Floor/Growing Old\\" is a genius song as it involves outstanding singing with great narration from Andre and Big Boi. One of the albums best lyrical moments comes from Andre: \\"no one is free when others are oppressed\\". <BR>This album has a very relaxed and laid back feel to it. It is incredibly enjoyable as the beats and mixture of rapping/singing is music that your ears cannot help but take in and get submerged into.
B00005QHPQ|1.0|Did you know that there are only a FEW songs on this cd?? Yes, he couldn't think of anything original, so 1/2 of it's in spanish, and 1/2 in english. <br />And also, did you know, he DOESN'T SING LIVE!! HE sounds alright in the studio, thanks to state-of-the-art computers. Just ask Howard Stern when Enrique tried to do a radio show in studio, live.. He COULDN'T!!!
B000053VAF|5.0|I love this film, it is so increbily funny, and you dont need to know much about the bible or Catholisism to understand this. The plot is incomplicated and easy to follow, yet very clever, the humor comes fast and thick, and has many classic lines( well there classics among me and my friends im not sure about anyone else) for example: \\"do it, do it and i'll...spank you\\" and \\"why the...did you hug my head\\" anyone who's seen the film and is not sure weather or not to buy the video or go all out and get the DVD I say get the DVD. The audio commmentary although it may not be very informative on the making of the film (who wants that anyway??) is abseloutly hillarius and ive listened to it loads of times. So next time you get a spare [$$] buy this, you wont be disapointed
B00000255X|5.0|This is an odd album for me.  Whilst made by the Zim in his prime, and clearly bursting with positives, it always leaves me a touch flat.  Admittedly, given his last release, he had the most difficult job in music since Bach wrote the Passion of St Stephen.<br />Side one works: Isis, One More Cup of Coffee, and Romance are all solid.  The former two being rambling and mystic, the latter being an incredibly dusty and jaunty (a Jack of Hearts meets Pat Garrett) with some joyful ululating.  On side two I really like Black Diamond Bay with its snapping snare and superb meter. Joey is regrettable at 11:05.<br />Throughout the violin of Scarlett Riviera rather dominates but is effective in largely giving the album a strongly gypsyish flavour and is sympathetic to Bob's vocal melodies.  Bob's singing is powerful and assured, and the rolling thunder players give the album an ensemble feel in stark contrast to the isolated performance on Blood on The Tracks.<br />Desire is a very good Dylan album, which means it is better than most other work in the popular music field.  His muse seems to be sporadically in evidence (one must wonder why he collaborated in the writing of this album), and would desert him further for Street Legal (with its splendid opener and closer and Senor being the only top notch offerings).  I would imagine that listening to this album on release, this would have been no let down (and remains comfortably his biggest shifter).  But, this is no Blood on the Tracks.  <br />It is worth adding for curiosity value that around ten years ago some nutter in Tasmania played this album a few times too many then, deciding that his wife (or was it mother) was Isis, decided to do her in.  He reportedly bludgeoned her to death to the album, and danced on her whilst dousing her with coffee to the strains of One More Cup...  And some people want guns banned!!
B00005JLDW|3.0|An enjoyable film, and the reason is simple, lots of action. It is the use of the notion that all human life is at the brink of extinction as the dinosaurs were before us that causes a struggle for the survival of human kind. Moreover, the film brought the circular pattern of life to the screen in many different ways, which enhanced the cinematic experience to a more cerebral level. Intertwined with the circular pattern of life were some psychological predicaments in the characters that indulge the audience to ponder human psychology, leadership rolls, and existentialism.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I highly reccomend buying this c.d.  John Mayer is the greatest!
B00003CXTF|2.0|This movie was terrible. They tried to imitate Titanic, but there was some vital things missing:<BR>1) No chemistry between the actors. I honestly cannot believe that Affleck and Beckinsale are in love. Nowhere compares to Rose and Leo.<BR>2) Terrible acting<BR>3) Overdramatic- slow motion should be outlawed<BR>4) A SLLLOOW beginning<BR>5) Cannot relate to characters<BR>The ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars is for the special effects; they are actually quite good. But that's it. Don't waste your money.
B000069AT7|5.0|Despite  contrary belief i think universal did a great job with the gift set.It has the original script,the 1982 version with is not on the collector's edition,and the original soundtrack remastered this dvd will be worth alot more than the 2 disc set.This gift set is great so buy it.
1561007323|5.0|Lee Child is off to a great start -- good plotting and characters, crisp writing, great suspense, and an opening chapter that really pulls you in. Jack Reacher is good company and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the novels in this series. If you're into audio books, the unabridged reading by Dick Hill is outstanding. Hill brings each character to life, and does a particularly good job with three elderly black characters - the town's two barbers and their sister.
B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott has publicly stated that he would like to work on a Special Edition of Black Hawk Down.Remember this what Ridley Scott has stated not Columbia Pictures.If a Special Edition does come out expect it to have commentary,documentaries about the film and real life,and many other things.If Ridley Scott he will probably give a rebate to those who purchased the previous version like i have since alot of people already have bought the first edition.
B000000OXH|5.0|&quot;Alpha&quot; picks right up where &quot;Asia&quot; left off.  Once again, Palmer, Wetton, Downes, and Howe have produced a masterpiece of vocals and insturmentals.  &quot;Don't Cry&quot; is the disc's signature song and it is filled with roaring guitars, thundering drums, and searing keyboards.  This was another staple song on MTV.  &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes&quot; also had success.  &quot;The Heat Goes On&quot; features a powerful drum solo by Palmer, and the other tracks are  well-written and the insturmentals are teriffic.  Unfortunately, &quot;Daylight&quot; is not available on this CD, but its on the Best Of collection.
6300270424|5.0|Awesome is the best way to describe TSRTS.  It was just as I remembered it having seen the original as it came out at the movie theater.  I just wish my television set was as big as the theater's with the sound system.  Having missed out on seeing Zeppelin live, this makes up for it.  Truly the greatest visual interpretation of Zeppelin as they were then.  Robert hitting the high notes and Jimmy strummin through Dazed and Confused is spectacular.  What more can one say other then too bad Bonzo passed away in 1980.  To be a rock an not to roll!!!!!
B000000OMB|5.0|In 1982, Steve Howe of Yes, Carl Palmer of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Geoff Downes of The Buggles, and John Wetton of King Crimson formed one of Rock's first &quot;supergroups&quot;.  The result of this union was this unvbelievable debut album.  Penned by Wetton and Downes, this album produced the classics &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;.  This album was released at the same time MTV hit the airwaves, so these songs received many hours of play.  This album still ranks as one of my personal favorites even after 20 years.  I can't get enough of Geoff Downes' keyboard work and especially Carl Palmer's unparalleled drumming.  Each track is first-rate and the insturmentals are perfectly blended.  This album is a must for serious rock music fans.
B000068QY7|4.0|To me, Oasis' zenith was (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, an album that contains quite a few of my all-time favorite Oasis songs. (The title track being one.)<br />Standing On the Shoulder of Giants wasn't all that bad, but it certainly was no Morning Glory.<br />Heathen Chemistry is a cross between Morning Glory and Giants. It contains an abundance of signature Oasis riffs and lots of melodic passages. It's immediately accesible from the opening track (&quot;The Hindu Times&quot;). And it even features a beautiful ballad in the form of &quot;She is Love&quot; -- one of the prettiest, most non-cynical songs I've heard from the Gallaghers in a long time.<br />Sure, Oasis sounds reminiscent of the Beatles -- but not lyrically, nor in the chord progressions of their songs. (I think the Beatles actually used more chords.) If anything, they sounds like the Beatles in their Britishness and attitude. Frankly, there's not a song on Heathen Chemistry I could put my finger on and say, &quot;Yeah, that's the Beatles.&quot; So, let's lay off the Beatles comparisons, for Pete's sake!<br />Speaking of the chord progressions, they're big, big big on Heathen Chemistry. That trademark wall of sound that I liked so much on Morning Glory is all over Heathen Chemistry. (Check out &quot;Hung in a Bad Place,&quot; track three.)<br />Liam is in fine vocal form. Noel is as deft as ever with his guitar work.<br />&quot;Songbird&quot; is another pretty track. Acoustic guitars, tamborine, piano, and other non-typical Oasis instruments make this another stand-out track for me. Great song.<br />&quot;A Quick Peep&quot; is a driving tune with lots of heavy bass, organ, acoustic guitar and a groove I'm going to enjoy watching in concert (if they play this track!).<br />&quot;Better Man,&quot; the last track, is a guitar-heavy rocker of the old school that's a great way to close the album. It, too, has a cool groove that keeps pushing the song forward to the final feedback-laden fade-out at about 4:18...and then falls silent for about another 30 minutes...returning with something entirely different at 33:13 after someone says, &quot;...two, three, four.&quot; I wonder how many people have sat through the Gallagher's 30 minutes of silence to discover this &quot;hidden&quot; musical interlude buried way, way deep on the disc? (It's kind of a haunting &quot;song,&quot; though, about four minutes in length. Worth hearing, even given the interminable wait.)<br />Let's put this in perspective. Track 11 is nearly 40 minutes in length, with only about seven minutes of actual music, separated by about 33 minutes of silence. In other words, Heathen Chemistry clocks in at 76 minutes, but there's only about 40 minutes worth of music on it. Clever? Or exasperating? You be the judge. <br />Heathen Chemistry is trademark Oasis. If you like a British attitude, clever chord progressions, a lead singer with a terminally nasal, raspy voice, and songs with lyrics that usually twist the knife in a cynical, albeit clever way, you can't go wrong with the latest CD from Oasis.<br />But if you *really* want to be blown away, pick up a copy of (What's the Story) Morning Glory? That's a classic.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen certainly seems to have done a great job earning her name in the literary world. I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to have been able to earn such a status in the very much male dominated era that she belonged to. This book illustrates two major themes of that period - the somewhat male dominated society, and the class structure in the early 19th century England.<br />At the beginning of the book Elizabeth Bennet the heroine of the novel seems doomed in every sense. She is both female, and does not have an inheritance that will earn her a respectable marriage. However, what she does possess are things that cannot be bought with money - she is by far the smartest woman in the book, and has an incredible sense of humor. It is in fact these two traits that the aristocratic Mr.Darcey finally finds irresistable, and leads to him proposing marriage not once, but twice. It is only at the very end of the book that Elizabeth gives in, and agrees to the marriage - much to the surprise of both her parents and her older sister. This marriage is significant in that it brakes steadfast barriers. It seems almost as though it is the beginning of the end for the English class structure.<br />Jane Austen is a brilliant writer and you will find her work easy to follow. I can assure you that you won't regret reading it - I haven't, and I have read it many, many times. It is almost addictive.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-man is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have been a fan since I was 5 years old and this movie didn't disappoint. The computer generated graphic were so realistic, it felt like you were in the movie. Tobey Maguire did a great job portraying Peter Parker, smart and geeky, finally becoming the cool, confident super hero. The movie is worth the money to see and when it comes out on DVD, it will be a must have!
0887307280|4.0|The loan officer who was handling the details for my new business loan mentioned two books that might help me  one of them was Gerbers E-Myth. It did an excellent job of defining a systems approach to business to ensure that you run your business instead of your business running you  a real light bulb moment for me that made me rethink how I was going to set up my business. My only criticism of the book is that, once the reader begins to understand the need for systems in order to grow and be profitable, the rest of the book becomes a commercial for Gerbers consulting services. It was frustrating. Thats where the other book he mentioned (How to Make Your Business Run Without You by Susan Carter) took over. The E-Myth does a great show-and-tell of what to do, and Carters book gives succinct details of how to do it. Although a bit pricey, it was a lot less expensive than hiring a Gerber consultant! If you are just starting out in business, or are feeling overwhelmed in the one you already have, the E-Myth is a great book to show you how to own your business, instead of \\"owning\\" your job.
B000001F9E|5.0|This album's greatness makes me realize that Thin Lizzy never really got its due, or at least it sure doesn't get it now.  Everybody knows (and overplays) The Boys are Back in Town, but the title track is even better, in my opinion.  The carefree, rebellious attitude is what rock is all about, and the simple lyrics help get that across.  Also, the eruption of rock on The Cowboy Song makes it my second favorite on the album.  If you're looking for another classic rock album to add to your collection, this one is a good choice.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|i liked it. it kept me wondering. well the film is backwards. it starts withwhat would be the end sequence and ends with the beginning. it is a superb mystery about a guy whos wife was murdered but by who. there are so many suspects. this movie does exit the plot once in a while to fill in another great sequence. overall this is not for everyone. if you dont like confusion dont rent or buy it. but if you like to be confused this is your movie.
6304493681|5.0|I first saw this movie at my university's theater during a \\"classic anime week.\\" I'll admit that the first time I saw the movie it bored me to no end. Though I was impressed by the two main action sequences, I lost track of the plot early on and couldn't get back into it. Big mistake.<br />So I watched it again. Now I find the pace to actually be very, very good. The movie is fast-paced, even in dialogue scenes as the viewer is almost drowned with information (very fitting to the setting, IMHO). As I don't watch much anime, I can't really comment on the quality of the animation, though I was impressed. If you liked \\"The Matrix,\\" you'll probably like this movie, even if you have to see it twice (it's worth it).<br />And a brief comment about the nudity. The first time I saw the movie, it turned me off. The second time, it seemed completely natural and realistic. And it is, if you think about it. Other than contrasting our preception of her sexuality with the reality that she is mostly machine, the nudity is just a simple necessity when the Major wants to pull that invisible trick. There's nothing else too it. She even manages to look androgenous a lot of the time.
6304795254|5.0|michael douglas and sean penn star in a strange but excellent movie. douglas is invited to play a game simply called the game by his lunatic brother. well douglas decides  to play the game and when everything goes awry the viewer trys to figure it out. this was an excellent movie and i would reccomend it to absolutely anybody.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson team up for this very funny, very original film that pokes fun of today's fashion industry, based on a VH1 Fashion show.  Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, an international Male Supermodel who is brain washed into attempting to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  Accompanied by Will Ferrell, this film has a good screenplay and great comedic acting.  A must have for Stiller and Wilson fans.
6305546789|4.0|This is one of the greatest horror films of all time. First of all  this movie is very scary (unless you've seen many horror films). This movie sends good thrills a chilling feeling when you watch. you can rise  from the characters and understand them then they die. this movie provides an excellent story and makes you wonder of the ever Michael Myers. I reccomend this to all horror fanatics and people who just like being scared.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Excelente presentacion, excelente contenido, audio estupendo, video sorprendente, las escenas recortadas me hicieron delirar, Esta pelicula es un clasico de la accion, quien no la haya visto sencillamente no sabe lo que es una buena pelicula de accion, el poner el audio original resulta ser un detallazo (las balas en el audio en estereo no suenan igual de bien que en el audio original, facilmente apreciable por los disparos de la 45 de el terminator), los trailers son para hacer llorar a los fanaticos como yo..entrevistas, fotos...no se que mas decir no le encuentro ningun defecto, ojo que la calidad del DVD se ve desde el case del mismo...ahorita me voy a verla..
B000003CMB|3.0|I bought this CD on seeing so many 5 stars, and glowing reviews. The first couple of tracks started out tight, with some very nice slide guitar. But it really went downhill after that. The problem is Dicky Betts isn't a good blues guitarist, and so much of this album tries to be an improvised blues jam. ABB seem most effective in the studio where they excel with short, melodic guitar lines. Basically, this live album format hasn't stood the test of time well.<br />Perhaps the letdown was because I had recently bought Derek & Dominos live album (also at Fillmore, one year before). Whereas Clapton at his peak can sustain your interest over 10+ mins, the ABB band isn't quite up to that level of invention, or fluidity. By comparison the guitarists here seem like imitators (except Duane on slide). With some tracks the only outstanding feature is their length.<br />The two drummers prove that too may cooks can spoil the broth. Just compare them with the energetic Jim Gordon on the D&D album.<br />Definitely some good tracks but this collection is not a great live album, let alone the \\"greatest\\". Doesn't come close to Who's Live at Leeds, or even Led Zeppelin's much criticized Song Remains the Same. When you hear 19-min guitar jams like these you can understand why punk rock happened (and I'm a rock guitar fan and player). This is for diehard ABB fans only. Sorry for the harsh review, but all those 5 stars wasted my $$$.
6305165912|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of the Coen brothers' work. I liked \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\", but I felt that the scripts were lacking. However, I thought that their unique, genre-fitting direction could make a great script into a fabulous movie. The Big Lebowski proved me right.<br />The plot involves a stoner named Jeff \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski who gets involved with a kidnapping scheme involving handicapped millionaires, German Nihilists, gen-x artists, porno producers, and a 15-year old brat with bad grades. Along for the ride is his Vietnam vet-friend, Walter, who is pretty much Rambo without intelligence, and their bowling buddy Donny, who is the most true to life characters in a long time.<br />The performances are brilliant. Jeff Bridges, the least likely person to play the Dude, makes him a sympathetic stoner who just wants to smoke Thai sticks and bowl. John Goodman is never afraid of overplaying his role, and it pays off with the funniest representation of a 'Nam vet ever. Philip Seymore Hoffman does so much with his small role, you won't believe he is credited in a \\"3 at a time\\". Steve Buscemi as Donny has few lines, but is present for the majority of the film. That is like many real friends, who say something once in a while, but end up just being there. Juliane Moore's character represents everything that the Dude doesn't like about people nowadays, a weird artist who is so complicated that talking to her is like reading 20 books at a time. She plays this role with ease and leaves a great impression. Flea and Peter Stormare join the ride as the German Nihilists and Tara Reid does her best job as an ex-porno star now married to a millionaire. And John Turturro deserves special acclaim for his brilliant, uncredited role as Jesus Quintana. This is the kind of performance that can make, \\"Don't F**k with the Jesus!\\" a catchphrase.<br />Joel Coen's direction really pairs with the brilliant dialogue in the film. He really shines in one dialogueless dream sequence in which the Dude imagines he's in a porno with Julianne Moore's character. He dances, teaches her how to bowl, rolls along the lanes as a bowling ball, all set to Kenny Roger's \\"Just Dropped In\\". The movie is well paced, but has the same problem which plagues all the Coen brothers' films: the 2nd act is FAR too long. Too many scenes that shouldn't have made it into the final cut come up and bore the audience. However, even those scenes have enough excellent dialogue and direction to make a book on.<br />If you have seen any other Coen clan film, see this immediately. Not only is this my favorite of their films, but it is my favorite film of 1998. It is funny, sweet, and most of all, quirky. VAZ Zahedi, over and Out.
B000066I6N|5.0|Dreamland is filled with mainly covers of 60s folk/rock/blues tunes.  The production is excellent, with a good mix of Eastern elements as well as modern electronic touches.  The members of Plant's band are superb musicians and back him well.  His voice is still in fine shape, although it's a bit thin on a couple of tracks.  Dreamland is much better (in my opinion) than Plant's last studio effort with Jimmy Page (&quot;Walking Into Clarksdale&quot;).  It does not have as much of the rock punch that &quot;Fate of Nations&quot; had, but it is another excellent Robert Plant solo album which should not be missed.
0062502182|5.0|a book about following your heart.  one of the most genuinely inspiring and wonderfully innocent books i have ever read.  kind of in the same spirit as herman hesse's &quot;siddhartha.&quot;  a must read for anyone.
B000069KGM|5.0|Anybody who thinks (and many do) that Chicago is simply a wimped-out ballad band with horns must check out their first album. I'm sure many people over the years, in fact, never made the connection between Chicago and Chicago Transit Authority. This is Chicago when they rocked, raw and loud. The late guitarist Terry Kath (whom Hendrix referred to as being a better axeman than himself!!) simply shreds on this album. Songs like \\"South California Purples\\" and \\"Poem 58\\" are so far removed from \\"You're the inspiration\\" as to not be believed! This is basically the band as they would never be again - the softer, ballad-ized approach Chicago would adopt for their entire subsequent career begins to rear its head as early as Chicago II - with songs like \\"Make me smile\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" being the only remnants of the heavier, progressive side of the band that shines so brightly on their first album. My only \\"complaint\\" is that the sound quality does not significantly differ from the original CD on Columbia - testament, I suppose, to the quality of the original mastering.
B0000039PW|5.0|This Album Is The Greatest Of All Time. Gimme The Loot Is the most Immpressive song lyrically it left me saying ooohhhh like every 4 times each verse, What Shocks Me is that the Song Was A Story With Biggie having a conversation with himself by changin the tone of his voice and going around robbing people. Another good song Is \\"Me and my b*tch\\" It shows how he can be hardcore then make an emotional song and still have a gangsta feeling. I could go on and on but i wont....... JUST BUY THE ALBUM
B00005RFAI|5.0|Can anyone honestly say there is another artist out there remotly similar to Pink?? She isn't R&B like Allyiah, Toya or Alycia Keys. She isn't pop like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson or Mandy Moore. She isn't a girly rock star like Michelle Branch or any of the other girly rock stars out now, and her style sure isn't tecno/new age/raver music like Kylie or DJ Encore or anyone else and her style diffently isn't funk rock like No Doubt. Whatever Pink is labeled as, she rocks. \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" proved that she wasn't going to be a one hit wonder when 3 or something songs on the album made it into the top 10 and with \\"Mizzunderstood\\" I think everyone can expect to be hearing from Pink for years to come. Something I personally look forward to.<br />I love Pink, condisering I'm only 20 and I believe she is as well, I relate a lot to the songs on Missunderstood. I liked the songs from Can't Take Me Home, I could get into them and dance with my buds but I never had that feeling like she was really singing about me and my life in any of those songs but with the songs \\"Just Like a Pill\\", \\"18 Wheeler\\", \\"Dear Diary\\" and \\"Lonely Girl\\" Pink's music has really touched me, making Mizzunderstood an album that I will probably listen to for years to come.
B000002P7R|1.0|THERE IS PROBABLY A GOOD REASON THIS MATERIAL IS OUTTAKES.  THIS ALBUM IS COMPLETELY UNLISTENABLE.  JIMI PRIDED HIMSELF ON THE COMPOSITION OF HIS ALBUMS, WHICH MAKES THIS MONEY GRABBING NONSENSICAL ALBUM EVEN MORE OF A TRAGEDY.  I THOUGHT THAT AS A GOOD HENDRIX FAN I SHOULD OWN AS MUCH JIMI AS I COULD GET MY HANDS ON.  RIDICULOUS.  IM SURE SOME WILL CLAIM THAT ONLY HARD CORE MUSIC FANS WILL &quot;GET&quot; THIS ALBUM.  DONT BUY IT.  INVEST IN A SECOND COPY OF HIS BLUES ALBUM OR BAND OF GYPSIES AND TAKE IT TO THE HOUSE.
0385486804|5.0|Was a great book. I love reading about the wilderness, Alaska, and Maine.  It was amazing how a man, just roaming America touched so many hearts and these strangers he met cared for him so.  Such a shame he thought he could conquer the Alaskan Wilderness.
0316666343|5.0|How can a book with this premise ring so true?  And how can a book with this premise be so hopeful and comforting?  I'm not sure how, but I agree with other readers that both happen here in Sebold's book.  I kind of tried to avoid the hype, but I'm glad I didn't.  I really love the tone and affection the author obviously has for her narrator.  It's a great story, a nicely drawn sketch of family, and an odd coming-of-age story (who knew one could come of age in heaven?) that works well.  I'm glad this author found her voice and look forward to her next book.
B000067CPX|5.0|Yes, the new Chili Peppers CD is different than Californication.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Californication, but it is nice to see that after all these years the Peppers still have new and creative stuff coming out.  I beleive that this album is a much more laid back, chill, and mature album than their previous ones.  Those who are fans of the punk side of RHCP might be slightly dissapointed, but I beleive that the true talent of this band shines though their clever lyrics and unique style.  &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Dosed&quot;, &quot;Minor Thing&quot;, &quot;By the Way&quot;, and &quot;Tear&quot; are songs that could not be written by or preformed well by ANY other band.  This album may not be universally appealing, but I beleive that true RHCP fans will find this CD brillantly executed and full of songs that you can listen to over and over and over.  I have not taken it out of my CD player since I bought it.

B000067CQK|3.0|Ziggy Stardust is one of the ten greatest albums that I have ever heard. The quality of the music isn't why I am giving this CD 3 stars. The reason that I am giving this edition three stars is because it is over priced. All of the music on this remaster could have fit onto one CD. Instead they put it on two CD's and charged the consumer the difference. The packaging here is pretty cool but it is not worth 22 dollars. If you don't have the original, buy it instead and save yourself the extra eight dollars. Back when Rykodisc had Bowie's catalog, they put out all of the songs on disc two of this collection but they put those songs on his other albums as bonus tracks and didn't charge the fan extra. Then EMI got Bowie's catalog and decided to not release the bonus tracks on his albums so that they could make more CD's out of them and I guess make more money. Don't be fooled by this. All of the music on both CD's equals about 79 and a half minutes of music. Short enough to fit onto one disc. The music industry is really slipping.

B000065U1N|2.0|The 2 stars aren't for the movie, which I think was fantastic.  The 2 stars are for the DVD.  Clearly, they spent no time on this DVD. There are no delted scenes, funny outtakes, in-depth featurettes, etc.  This makes me mad, because I think I know what's going to happen- a future DVD release packed with extras.  It's happened with Memento, Men in Black, and others.  <br />Some of my friends don't understand the fuss over the extras, preferring instead to just watch the movie.  That's fine, but I'm not shelling out [$$$] just for the movie.  If the movie was all I wanted, I'd buy the VHS, because frankly the improvement in picture quality isn't anything to scream about.  IF you're looking for a DVD along the lines of Star Wars: Phantom Menace or some of the Criterion DVDs, I'd wait until you're sure that they're not releasing a better Blackhawk Down in the future.
6305014140|3.0|This was one of the first annimes I ever saw so this movie totally hit me by surprise with the action, suspense, character development and others.  I gave this movie 3 stars for the following reasons:<br />Two stars for originality and compelling story.<br />Totally original and very compelling, I only had to watch it once to get the whole movie unlike other annimes that I have watched.  I was somewhat on the edge of my seat as the action got more and more intense.  I loved the 7 devils and their incredible abilities and how Jubei fought with every one of them, but my favorite part was where he fought in the woods with the blind ninja master.  That part was really cool.<br />I also gave this movie 1 more star for non-stop edge-of-your-seat action.  I never got board once, I never had to fastforward or skip any parts because of the lame or useless dialogue simply because there was none.  Almost every part of the movie was needed... except for some scenes that I will get into later.  As I said earlier, I loved the action sequences and the non-stop ninja techniques used, even if they were a little far fetched.<br />Now onto the things I think Manga could have taken out:<br />There were three sex scenes that I believe could've been taken out altogether.  Sexuality in movies is NOT neccesary unless the circumstances have to allow it such as the rape scene in the General's Daughter.  And the last things was excessive gore.  I thought that the blood spraying, skull splitting, blood drinking and massive loss of limbs was too much.  Gore is also not necessary unless the you have to have it, for example Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates it was needed whereas here it is not.  However this movie is non the less a great movie and well worth the low price amazon.com has set before you.<br />Whether you are an annime fan or not, this is the movie for you.
0440234743|2.0|You'll read this book in one night, and hate yourself in the morning.  Grisham has, as usual, created a compelling plot line.  But the characterization is too quick and stereotyped, even for the character we get to know best, Nate O'Riley.  His conversion to Christianity is almost casual in Grisham's hands, handled in paragraph long cliches, and as a result unconvincing.  The plot is predictable (and the text, at times, repetitive).  Despite all this it will hold your interest; it's a fine beach read, if that's a compliment. But at the end you'll wonder what you might have done with the time you just spent.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Wow!  I loved the movie Alien but this one by far is way better.  I bought this movie immediatly when it came out on special addition on DVD.  The DVD menu is well done with the marine camera shots and the special features are great too.  I liked how instead of having just the Aliens' trailer, it had ALL the Alien trailers as well which is very rare these days.  The photos were cool to look at and I loved how they described all the marines' equiptment.<br />Now the movie itself was also awesome!  I have a huge thing for marines and even thought they all died (except for Hix played by Micheal Bean) I still loved the movie.  I loved how Bill Paxton played Corporal Hudson, the nerdy/bad boy electronics expert.  They all did a great job as portraying the marine look and attitude.  And I thought the equiptment looked pretty darn convincing and cool at the same time.<br />The special effects were not only great at the time of it's release but are still good today.  The crew did an excellent job with the aliens, the marine spaceship and dropship.<br />I also loved James Horner's musical soundtrack.  He did an excellent job in Terminator 2, True Lies and The Last of the Mohicans however I think this was one of his best mastpieces.  He deserved an oscar for this one.<br />The acting could not have been better.  I mean Pual Riser was the corporate bad guy, that's pretty cool and unexpected.  Micheal Bean was great as the quiet, battle hardened marine.  Bill Paxton as mentioned above.  I'm not a Weaver fan but she did a great job anyway.<br />The suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will root for the marines.  Don't worry, the kick some serious tail and go down in all guts and glory.  And it was very tame gore and language wise as compared to other suspense movies.  That made me very impressed.<br />I can go on all day ranting about this movie but instead, I recomend you buy this movie today.  It's a great buy and fun to watch no matter how many times you watch it.u watch it.
B0000640VO|5.0|This has, after one watching, has become one of my all-time favorite movies!  After leaving the theater, I think everyone left with a smile on their face.  The story is that Amelie grows up, believing that she had a heart condition, and had to be isolated from other children.  Her parents are freaks and frequently treat her poorly.  When she finally moves out on her own, she dscovers the joy of improving other peoples lives.  This film is wonderfully happy , but without being too cheesey in the end.  A great date movie, of for when you're feeling low.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Star Wars Episode 1 was easily the most anticipated movie of the 90s.  However after waiting in line for 2 hours and finaly seeing the movie I was less then pleased with the movie.<br />First of all, the movie was way too commercialized.  George Lucas threw everything he could into the merchandise industry from pop can labels to inflatable Darth Maul chairs.  It really took the taste out of anyone's mouth.<br />Seccond was the plot:  Does anyone know what the plot was?  I couldn't.  I couldn't tell what the deal was with the Trade Federation and their dumb treaties.  And why Naboo?  Why some backwater boonies that no one cares about?  My point is the movie had NO plot, and if it did George Lucas did a poor job of showing it.<br />Third was the concentration on special effects:  George Lucas spent too much manpower and money on the special effects.  I give this movie two stars for the special effects.  In the first Star Wars, they concentrated on BOTH the special effects and the script and it became the most grossed in movie of all time. (after inflation rates of course)  The biggest example was the podrace, gosh what a boring scene!  It kept going on and on.<br />Fourth was the bad linking the other Star Wars movies:  Anyone who has watched the original Star Wars as much as me can easily see many things that don't add up.  Such as in Return of the Jedi, Obi tells Luke that when he met his father, he was already \\"a great pilot\\" but in Episode 1 he was just a little kid.  Then there's my favorite point that Obi says in the Empire Strikes Back that Yoda was the \\"Jedi master who instructed me\\" but in Episode 1 it was Liam Neeson who trained him.<br />5th is the bad script, characters and acting:  Can anyone honestly say that they wanted to see Jar Jar die?  I was hoping that Chewbacca would eat him in episode II.  His voice was annoying and I could hardly understand a thing he said.  Then there was Annakin, granted young kid actors arn't the best in the world however why did they pick THAT kid?  \\"Are you an angel?\\" \\"Then they blow you up!\\"  Come on!  Not only were those...lines but his acting was aweful.  George Lucas should've picked someone like Haley Joel or someone who can read from a script without looking at it.  Next we see Darth Maul.  He had a lot of potential as a villian, he was dark, calm and had one heck of a weapon (double edge lightsaber) however George Lucas decided to spend more time on the pod race then concentrating on character development.  Most of the script contained ...lines that would put the original Resident Evil game to shame...  I nearly[became ill]during the pod race.<br />The only reason why I gave this another star was because of the last Jedi vs. Sith fighting sequence.  It was well done however it does not make a movie.  Fighting sequences only make movies in the South Pacific.<br />Overall this was a big disapointment and will reflect on George Lucas for years to come.r why did they pick THAT kid?  \\"Are you an angel?\\" \\"Then they blow you up!\\"  Come on!

0393312836|5.0|Answer: Yes, it is wrong and unethical to dehumanize human monsters in order to make our world a safer place.  Humans, like oranges, are no fun when they are made of plastic.<br />Question: A clockwork orange looks just like a real orange, so why can't we squeeze it and make juice?<br />Perhaps I cringe more at the rape scenes than I did when I was a younger reader, and I wonder whether or not we could have done without some of that.  But the book is what it is: an idea taken to its logical, or illogical, conclusion.<br />This one ranks right up there with 1984.
B00004STPT|5.0|I have just finished reading through each one of the two hundred and eighty seven reviews for the soundtrack from the Motion Picture, Gladiator.  I read through each of them to see if there was even one review that could possibly match my feelings towards this splendid soundtrack.  And do you know what?  Not one did.  Not one came close to the emotions that fill me when I press play.   This soundtrack has shown me that each ear that captures the magnificent sounds written, conducted, and sung by Hans Zimmer, Lisa Gerrard, and Klaus Badelt (who, by the way, is working his way up there!)  differs.   It is just a wonderful thing to have in your possession.   It is a just a wonderful thing to create as the soundtrack of your life.  It is just a wonderful thing that I am proud to say I have borrowed from my fathers own private collection of every soundtrack to every movie in exsistence (which I don't plan on returning... hee hee)   I hope that everyone can enjoy each second of the seventeen tracks on this perfect piece of art.  <BR>:: takes a bow ::  <BR>Thank you and goodnight!

B00003CXI1|4.0|I have young relatives with, shall we say, &quot;issues.&quot;  Harry Potter, despite being a long movie which would normally inspire such witty kid-actions as &quot;try to hold your brother down till he turns blue while mom isn't watching&quot;, kept them glued to the screen for hours.  It also keeps them that way EVERY time we play it.  They just don't get bored, and there are fewer trips to the emergency room.<br />This is because the movie itself is a really well done version of a pretty good book.  I do think there are better books out there (the Narnia Series, for one) but Harry appeals to kids' sense of being unique, different and special.  Heck, it appeals to adults' (mine included) same sense.  I want to find the special train track myself, and I wish I could prove that all along my suspicions that maybe I was adopted or something were true and I was really this long-lost hero of a special world.  Maybe that sense of being special can help the ordinary muggles like me want to BE special, and do good things.  I think it's worth a try, and if it's at the cost of a movie rather than years of therapy, it's probably worth it.<br />The movie's action sequences are well drawn, the magic believable, the actor who plays Harry looks the part, and I loved the way they made Quidditch look real.  Get this for your kids.  They will learn something about how treating people the way you'd like to be treated yourself is a good thing.  They will also, whether muggle or magic kid, feel special and smart when they figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is.  Plus, it's just greatly entertaining.  (Then, try to slip them some other stuff, by saying &quot;It's a lot like Harry Potter).

6300215717|5.0|Roman Holiday is the most perfect film ever produced. Humor, romance, slapstick, dialogue, and most of all, poignancy. I had never seen an Audrey Hepburn film until a few years ago when my girlfriend (now wife) picked it up on video and said I would like it. I'm a big Gregory Peck fan, so I was like sure, I'll watch it. From the moment Audrey first appeared as the delightfully charming Princess Ann, I fell in love with her. I know that's a commonly used phrase when describing Audrey's performance in this film, but I don't know how else to describe it. I literally fell in love. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, and I think most movies are worthless [stuff] that have done more to destroy our culture than advance it. But my god this is the best film I've ever seen! I've probably seen it 10 times now, and every [single] time I see it I fall in love all over again and in the end my heart is left broken. Audrey and Peck's chemistry is magical. The scenery is beautiful, even in black and white. [Why], even Eddie Albert is wonderful! Every time I watch this movie I want to hold Audrey in my arms and kiss her and never let her go. I never felt this way about a stupid movie. But I can't help it. I refuse to own it. Why? Because I would spend all my free time watching it, to see if maybe, just maybe, this time they'll end up together. I end up catching it every few months on AMC, after which I'm in a funk for a few days. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is the only movie that hits me so deeply, so passionately. I'm almost angry that it does so, but what can I do? \\"Well, life isn't always what one likes, is it?\\"<br />What also bothers me is why these two never worked together again? Does anyone know? Please tell me. After Roman Holiday, I've found every other Audrey film to pale in comparison. The major fault of all of them is the lack of chemistry she shares with her costars (grouchy Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina; the laughable Gary Cooper in Love in the Afternoon; adecent effort by George Pappard in Tiffany's; the \\"I-bet-I-can-be-more-suave-than-you\\" performance of Cary Grant in Charade; I could go on forever). Audrey is wonderful and beautiful as usual, but the films are generally poor. Peck went back to the gritty hero roles (and was perfect in all of them), while Audrey was pawned off to every Hollywood romantic lead. I just don't get it. But then again, I don't think I'll ever get Hollywood.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is what dvds were invented for -- there are so many great features here!<br /><br />So in addition to seeing one of the funniest movies ever made, you can be entertained for hours with the extras, and the extras are terrific: subtitles in English, French or Spanish; audio track choices -- English (the original mono or a brand new full stereo version), French, a directors' (Gilliam and Jones) track or a commentary track with Cleese, Idle and Palin; a copy of the script overlaid on the film; a painstaking, hilarious Henry the IV-ish subtitle for those who don't like the film; a hard-of-hearing feature; killer rabbit easter eggs; animated menus using Gilliam's original animation; karaoke renditions of 'Knights of the Round Table', 'Sir Robin' and the 'Monks Chant'; a delightful 45 minute visit to the locations with Jones and Palin; an educational film about the 'other' uses of coconuts; Japanese versions of the French Castle and Knights Who Say Ni scenes, including references to the 'holy sake cup'; a 1974 BBC Film Night visit to a location site during filming; photos of tickets, press releases, reviews, posters, production stills and original artwork; trailers; cast credits (Palin played over a dozen parts!) with pictures of each character; a Lego knights version of the Camelot scene; pictures of sketches that were never used (a killer snail?!); a web link.<br /><br />A lot of effort went into this special edition dvd, and it shows.  I particularly enjoyed seeing Jones and Palin visit locations.  They were in a jolly mood, their comments are interspersed with film footage, and they meet affectionate and funny fans along the way.<br /><br />If you like this film you will love this dvd version; if you love the film, you wil adore this two-dvd set.  An essential item for your collection.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B000059T00|4.0|This was the most successful of bassist Rich Grech's commercial endeavors. He covers songs by the likes of Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Buddy Holly, and Ginger Baker. Many of these fine musicians appear on this album! (The exception being Holly, but word is he would have liked to be there.) There are not many songs, partly because \\"Do What You Like\\" takes up over 15 minutes, and about half of that is a drum solo! People were really into that kind of stuff back then. But no long bass solos... go figure.
B00005LC4B|3.0|First of all, Martin Scorcese is one of my favorite directors and I include movies like TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS among my most cherished films of all time. That being said, I cannot for the life of me figure why he chose to remake this 1962 classic which to me is tantamount to someone trying to remake one of his fine films mentioned above in another 10 or so years. It's almost unthinkable.<br />If you've never seen the original film, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, and you are someone who appreciates GREAT filmmaking, do yourself a favor and see the original. If you are a collector, BUY the original on DVD and add it to your collection. I PROMISE you will not be disappointed.<br />This 1991 version stars Robert DeNiro as Max Cady and I think he does a great job reprising and, in some none-too-subtle ways, updating on the character. Frankly I never expected less from an actor of DeNiro's abilities. But Robert Mitchum's Max Cady is truly one of the scariest and most disturbing portrayals of a villian in cinematic history. What makes Max Cady so terrifying is his believability; he is not simply an \\"evil rapist,\\" this guy is a living, breathing nightmare in every sense. I think DeNiro captured a little of that quality too, but then took it too far over the top. Perhaps the only reason Mitchum never got an Oscar nod was that his performance was perhaps *too disturbing* for the times to even be considered back then, when Best Actor almost always meant the protagonist of the story.<br />As the Amazon.com editor states, comparing these two versions only proves to show how much more terror and suspense the original is able to achieve despite not being nearly as graphic or gratuitous with the on-screen violence. Especially compare the ending of the two films, where the original sizzles while the remake fizzles into a series of laughably forgettable cliches. The difference is one is a Classic from start to finish, whilethe other is an homage with earnest intentions and a good start that ultimately deteriorates into not much more than a gratuitously violent slasher film.<br />The only performance in the 1991 version I thought was intriguing and stood out from the original was Juliete Lewis as the daughter. Not necessarily better, but a more dynamic performance for that character. But if you really want to see a classic thriller that is a cut above the average from beginning to end, check out the original and you be the judge.
B000002KMY|5.0|Tommy Iommi's firing of Ozzy Osbourne was the best thing to happen to Sabbath......and to Ozzy.  Face it, the band was going nowhere fast, and could you imagine living without such Ozzy scorchers as &quot;Crazy Train,&quot; &quot;No More Tears,&quot; &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; and &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (don't bust my chops on this last one, Ozzmosis RULES, so there!)?<br />Now, Ozzy may be the Prince of Darkness, but Ronnie James Dio was Lord of the Night.  Asking me whether I prefer Ozzy or Dio is like asking whether I prefer Scotch or Canadian whiskey; Couldn't I have BOTH?  Dio was technically better -- that guy can hold a note for close to a minute, which is something he does every other line or so.  Ozzy's strength is embuing each song with this bottomless pit of emotion.<br />I love this whole record, but the sheer mastery of &quot;Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; is reason alone to buy it.  &quot;Concept Rock&quot; is something best left where it came from, in the 1970s.  Spinal Tap's parody song &quot;Stonehenge&quot; and concept album &quot;Rock and Roll Creation&quot; is evidence enough to support this contention.  But, occassionally, someone with the sheer melodic talent of Dio comes along and pulls it off audaciously.  &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was more of a concept album in this regard, but I think that Dio's contribution with Sabbath to concept rock rivals even Rush's &quot;2112&quot; or &quot;Farewell to Kings&quot; or Dio's own first solo record, &quot;Holy Diver.&quot;
B00005OWIU|3.0|I have read many reviews on magazines, web pages, and even on Amazon.com regarding how John Williams scored the music for the film version of \\"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone\\".  I have to say that this CD has magical and beautiful themes, best represented in the prologue and 'Hedwig's Theme'.  'The Quidditch Match' is spectacular, and it's one of the highlights on this CD.  'Christmas At Hogwarts' is enchanting because of the use of a kinda dark male chorus.  'The Chess Game' is very suspenseful, keeping the listener on the verge.  All of that is presented by the genius of John Williams.<br />However, I regret to say that the rest of this score is somewhat dense and long.  When I first listened to it, I was wondering why Williams wrote such dark music in the middle of magical moments, because I was a little uncomfortable.  When I saw the movie, I realized why:  The film itself is dark and a bit heavy, something that I find puzzling in a fantasy movie.  It's like Williams was looking for some notes to make this movie 100% fantastic.<br />Many people might say John Williams is losing his edge in the genres of adventure, science-fiction, or fantasy.  I may have to disagree with that.  I have to say that those kinds of movies offer little to the maestro these days, and \\"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone\\" is no exception.  I think John Williams still has it when he is given good projects.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I stumbled upon the Flaming Lips live at the Leeds festival in the UK three years ago. They were promoting the release of their new album, 'The Soft Bulletin', and were breathtakingly magnificent. I had never even heard of them before I saw that beautiful act, but as soon as I had I resolved to buy their album as soon as possible. I was pleased to find it utterly wonderful. Imagine my joy when I found that their new album, 'Yoshimi...' was even greater, having purchased it ahead of release date using shady contacts in the record store industry... <br />Full of swooning pop melodies conducted in bizarre ways; 'Yoshimi' sounds like the number one album from an alternative universe. This album is brimming with sunlight and beauty. It is also an album about death and resignation, hope and living life to the full. 'Yoshimi' takes the idea of an eccentric Japanese girl fighting killer robots and uses it as an alegory for coping with the mortality of loved ones. Wayne Coyne somehow takes a strange manga fantasy and runs with it through the album, sculpting it into a plea for you to enjoy your time with people you see as vunerable and on the cusp of death and to make their life full by living life with them as if in ignorance to their mortality. Not only that but it also concerns the mortality of the listner, emphasising the need to enjoy the benefits of life and nature rather than worry about the spectre of death. The Flaming Lips convey this in format that sounds akin to The Beach Boys meets Neil Young, Autechre, Kraftwerk, Radiohead, 50's pop, Beatles, New Order... practically anybody who had a strange yet instinctive knowledge of pop. <br />Which is basically what Wayne and his two mates have. An almost uncanny concept of what makes pure pop. The single 'Do You Realize' has the most rousing pulse and chorus, driven by Wayne's cracked vocals and Dowd's masterful multi-instrumental work. The title track is a bouncing song with absurd lyrics that you believe in because ofthe conviction with which they are carried. Several tracks use squelching retro-future battle noises, majestic synths, orchestral sonics and immensely catchy tunes to explore a future facade that is an anime big-screen vehicle for Wayne's concerns as to the state of happiness of the summer time and coping with loss. This is the best album I have heard in the past four years, possibly the album of it's decade. The Flaming Lips are glorious and needed more now than ever. I implore you to buy this and enjoy. <br />BLIM!

B0000541AM|5.0|Regarding &quot;The Warriors&quot;, I see that story as symbolic for life.  Many of us are born so innocent and trusting, just as the Warriors were &quot;not packing&quot; and thus going into incredible unknown dangers without weapons, only because they trusted those that had instructed them. Once they were caught in life's cycle of senseless troubles they fought hard and along the way back home, lost members (just like we all lose some of ourselves as we take life's blows), but the core just got tougher and never fell. They made it back.<BR> <BR>&quot;You Warriors are Good&quot;. <BR> <BR>&quot;We are the Best&quot;.<BR> <BR>That is Life at it's most beautiful

B0000584TJ|3.0|This album is probably a lot heavier in feel than you might expect from Steve Hillage, but the inclusion of two members of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, may have alot to do with it.I find the vocals melodramatic in style and can sometimes detract from the complex music presented here.<BR>There are some great moments, especially between Hillage on guitar and Dave Stewart on organ (both went on to greater things with &quot;Gong&quot;,&quot;Hatfield and the north&quot; and the album &quot;Fish Rising&quot;).<br />Although the music is varied in feel the style gets a bit samey after a while; its an interesting album to hear these musicians playing early in their careers, but I found it fairly hard going, and wouldn't put at the top of my list of must haves!!

B000000I02|5.0|After leaving Caravan, Richard Sinclair formed Hatfield and the North.Its more instrumental and jazzy in feel compared with Caravan, but not overbaringly so. There are many light, ethereal moments as well as heavier denser passages.<BR>Sinclair's whimsical songs make a nice balance against the other instrumental based tracks and a special mention should go to the two extra tracks;\\"Let's eat\\" and \\"Fitter Stokes has a bath\\".These made up the two sides of their only single and give a good introduction to the group.<BR>They really don't sound like anyone else, with inventive use of atmospheric female vocals, sound effects and superb musicianship, its a record that will grow on you over time and is certainly recommended to fans of \\"Caravan\\" and other Canterbury bands.Some great song titles too!

I was like 4 or so then, though. Anyway, he said that it was about an ongoing mystery of the murder of this girl. First thought that entered my mind was \\"OK---this sounds like the first couple episodes are great, but it should get boring after a while\\". We watched it, and I just loved it. I hope they put the second season on DVD soon. I recomend this series to anyone who loves a good mystery.
B000062YAZ|5.0|ABOUT 3 MINUTES, that's all Slayer needs to send you into spiraling venture of unyielding musical horror! Undoubtedly, \\"REIGN IN BLOOD\\" BECAME THE GENESIS of countles metal bands that came after. Who else but Slayer could have magnificently interpreted THE HORRORS AND SADISTIC MINDSET OF NAZI SS OFFICER, JOSEPH MENGELE. This is reality based horror.
B00005JLDW|2.0|Where did this movie come from?  I'm fairly current on films being released, but I never heard of this one coming out.  Could it be that it was scheduled for later release and then moved up to cash in on full lines to see other blockbusters?  Could it be that it was canned for a long time and then dumped in the middle of blockbuster season on unsuspecting viewers?<br />Either way, Reign of Fire is sadly disappointing in everything but the visuals.  <br />The Good:  Since T2 and Jurassic Park, we have come to expect a much higher grade of special effects in films.  Reign does not disappoint in that respect.  The dragons are amazingly realistic looking (is that possible, since they never existed?).<br />The Bad:  Matthew McConaughey absolutely chews up the scenery, he's overacting so badly.  He's doing some sort of \\"Sgt. Rock\\" impression throughout, attempting to be this ultra tough commando who apparently has a crotch itch or something stuffed up his bum, because he sure does walk funny.  He chews a cigar constantly and overemotes incessantly.  Why he has more tattoos than the Illustrated Man is not known, but seems a ridiculous character trait.<br />The Good:  Christian Bale does his very best to keep his character centered and in doing so, becomes the emotional center of the film - which is what the film sorely needs.  He reacts believeably and shows his emotions appropriately for the situation in which his character exists.<br />The Bad:  This story has more holes in it than swiss cheese.  If we assume that the premise this movie uses is real for the characters, then there are some serious \\"reality\\" issues to deal with.  If one dragon was discovered by Bale's character when he was a child and according to the story, it was a male - where did the rest of the dragons come from?  If dragons have been running around for 16 years when McConaughey's character arrives, and dragons love igniting stuff and almost the entire world is industrially devoid - where is all the gasoline coming from that they use to power the autos?  And even if there were some reserves available, how is McCon's convoy availing itself of it?  Further, how in the heck did the convoy get from the U.S. to Great Britain, if just about anything moving gets burned to a crisp by the dragons?  If there is only one male dragon which must fertilize all the female's eggs, and that one male is only located in GB, how can it fertilize the eggs of the dragons throughout the rest of the world?  Why does McCon's character sacrifice himself?  He has no ingrained knowledge that in doing so he will save the day.  It makes no sense.<br />The Good:  The film looks really cool.  It's shot in blues and greys and looks realistic to the film's premise.<br />The Bad:  The film drags in many places.<br />The Bad:  The filmmakers missed the opportunity to develop the emotional relationship with Bale and his eldest \\"adopted\\" son.  The basics are there, but it isn't nearly as fleshed out as McCon's overacting is.<br />The Verdict:  Wait until it hits video and then you'll only waste 4 bucks.
0792836634|5.0|Child's Play, the classic of pint-sized terror cinema! A great horror movie from 1988, which featured Chucky, a miniature stalker, who can literally look-up to Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers and others. However, his attitude tells us, he would be mean enough to take them on, how far he'd get is quite predictable, however, the characters in this flick, as played by Alex Vincent, Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon, are absolutely stunned by his presence and have quite the difficult time with his great hyper-active, fast-moving energy. Chucky is ofcourse played by Brad Dourif, with so much energy, emotion and characteristic diversity... all verbally grappled. Dourif has been seen in many films, though my favorite role of his is as Chucky, wear he only ever showed his face, during the opening moments of this film. As Detective Mike Norris, Chris Sarandon gives the character a typical Detective-type feel, smoking cigarettes, tiring from work, and passionate about tying up loose-ends.<br /> Ofcourse the key character in the story, is Andy Barclay played by Alex Vincent, who is the target of whom Chucky wants to transfer his soul into. The filmmakers obviously knew a killer doll film would go customary with a kid victim. Ofcourse no one would believe him, thinking he has an active imagination, only. Catherine Hicks plays his mother Karen Barclay, who eventually discovers that her son's story is true, during one of the film's breakout moments, when Chucky fouls-off and bites like a baby from hell!<br /> This film has some classicly funny moments which filmmakers would continue with during the sequels. Child's Play definitely has that unique twist in the slasher genre, delivering great chills, laughs and ofcourse some gruesome death scenes
0380820846|2.0|I have been waiting for this book for months on end, but Julia Quinn, this time around, did not deliver. There was a decided lack of emotiveness, feeling, chemistry, call it what you will, on either Colin's or Penelope's part, especially Colin's. He appeared to go with the flow of the idea of being in love, and even after declaring his love, there was no that sense of well being one gets after reading a scene that is supposed to move you. For those who are reading JQ's book for the first time, then it can be passably good, but having read her earlier books, like the _Duke and I_, _Dancing At Midnight_, this one was terrible. Just to be generous 2 stars will suffice because it's JQ but otherwise......
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is a staple of sci-fi action films. His villainous status is as remarkable as his status as the hero. <BR>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the character with great passion, giving the machine it's cold, merciless attitude. Stan Winston creates one of his early greats here, giving the machine a terrifying effect, and the stop-motion animation is an endoskeleton version of the great Jason And The Argonauts skeletons. <br />The Terminator has plenty of action and atmosphere to please, James Cameron handles it's style the way he handles his passion for filmmaking. A truly cool sci-fi tale that tells us the future might fall into the hands of the machines that we build, and that wouldn't be a surprise.
B000002HJA|5.0|If you don't get it straight off, give it time. <br />This is far better than anything by Zeppelin, Metallica, and even Tool; and those are three of the greatest bands in history; period.  I've heard countless Black Sabbath covers, but Kyuss' rendition of Into the Void (on the album after &quot;Circus&quot;)is the best, with the heaviest opening since Korn's &quot;Blind&quot;.<br />&quot;Sky Valley&quot; is a classic, but &quot;Circus&quot; is more inventive and extremely powerful.  I say buy all the Kyuss albums if you really want to hear rock perfection.  Their sound is vast and purifying.<br />I wish more people had appreciated Kyuss while they were around, but it always gives me a kick to throw in this CD for those who've never heard it.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Fabulous is the only word I can think of to describe this particular CD. It is Cher at her absolute best, her powerful voice tracing through dance anthems such as &quot;Taxi Taxi&quot; and &quot;Strong Enough&quot;. The smash-hit #1 Believe is definately the best recording, but this is also definately not one of those CDs that you buy for the hit song and never listen to the rest. No, folks, this is one of those CDs that you enjoy from beginning to end. It is proof that no one bridges the age gap like Cher. Although sometimes corny, you have to admit, that whatever she does, her Cherness shines!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Buy this cd. You will not regret it. I only wish there were more bands making music this good today. You will enjoy this for years to come.
B000002UDG|1.0|If this is all the best, I'd shoot myself before having to endure all the worst. Essentially, only three listenable songs are included here: \\"Another Day\\", \\"Ebony and Ivory\\", and \\"No More Lonely Nights\\". (The latter two of these three have attractive melodies but very weak lyrics, and \\"Another Day\\" is marred by Linda McCartney's unmusical back-up vocal.) Among the most excruiatingly sickening are \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Listen What the Man Says\\", and \\"Silly Love Songs\\". <br />You'd do much better, I think, to buy a copy of either \\"Ram\\" or \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" -- which is not to say that either of these is anything close to a consistently good record.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Sure it wasn't a good film but you have to understand it's a completely different time period, it took place 40 or somewhat years before the original Star Wars so of course it's not gonna be the same!  I've grown to like this film a lot, because it's an introduction, and even though Jar Jar Binks as annoying as he is isn't as bad as you think, the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi were worse!  The point of this story is to focus on the trade federation dispute and Anakin's training beginning after he's freed as a slave.  I think many people expected it to start off like that and were disappointed because it didn't have much of a story. Star Wars ep. 4 didn't have much of a story either, it was an introduction to the characters and this is what ep .1 is!  Ep. 2 is better than this only because the REAL story starts with that film as &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; went into detail with Luke Skywalker, so in other words STOP bashing the film! It's not as bad as you think it is, it was probably one of the better movies that was out in 1999, imagine that?
B000066NW0|5.0|I like Avril because she's cool, i can relate to her music and she's her own person! I love the way she dresses , i like her attitude and her lyrics are so truthfull and have meaning to them. I love the song \\"complicated\\" and my other three favorite songs that i just love to sing are \\"nobodys fool\\" \\" losing grip\\" and \\"unwanted\\". I just love those lyrics to those songs! but other then that her cd is nice! Avril I love ya girl! Keep rockin!!
B00004XPP0|5.0|These movies are classic, however the digital enhancing and added scenes don't add much, I only own the vhs to have a remastered copy of the 3 films...What is really amazing is that George Lucas didn't censor his classic films as opposed to his buddy Stephen Speilberg, instead he just added more enhanced graphics and took scenes he left out and added them in so we can see things we've never seen before, I think the only reason I went to go see these movies was because they were in the movie theatre and not on my tiny television, the updated graphics didn't stun me as much as the sound and picture of the big screen, overall, if you like the movies a lot and can't wait for the DVDs which are never gonna be released!!! :-( buy this vhs set.
B000066NW0|2.0|This girl is so overwhelmed with her own \\"punkness\\" its embarrassing. <BR>She trashes Britney Spears for no reason at all. Britney Spears somebody whose shouldn't even matter to her because i mean she's pop and Avril soo punk right? Britney Spears has a song called Boys and she has a song called Sk8er Boy? I mean come on! Sk8er Boy?! She should just be herself. In her song Complicated she complains about ppl who are \\"fake\\". Mabye Avril should take her own advice. I listen to punk music. I really like punk music and i have punk friends..but that doesn't mean i am a PUNK because i mean thats just not me. I think Avril is very confused and it shows in her songs. She sounds (and dresses) like she really wants to be a punk (she REALLY wants to) but isnt so sure about it. The result a half-[baked] record.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I was lucky enough to get Yoshimi about a month ago and just like the Soft Bulletin, it has gotten better and better with every listen. After hearing Yoshimi a countless number of times I still find myself discovering new things that I had not noticed in previous listens. When I first heard that the Lips were coming out with another album I got very excited and in some ways a bit nervous. Would they go the safe route and make the new album essentially the Soft Bulletin Part 2 by sticking to the same formulas. Maybe they would risk everything and go off on some unforeseeable tangent with results that could be great, good or less than good. <br />Luckily they sort of did both while ending up with no negative results, only greatness.<br />Yoshimi isn't as much a step away from the Soft Bulletin as it is a step sideways. Many of the songs have for the most part traded the `Wall-of-Sound' technique that 90% of the Bulletin uses for a more subdued electronic/acoustic/symphonic sound (All We Have is Now, Funeral In My Head, In the Morning of the Magicians, Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon, Up Above the Daily Hum, Ego Trippin, One More Robot).<br />A couple of the other songs on Yoshimi could fit right into the Bulletin seamlessly (Do you realize?, Are You a Hypnotist?).<br />`Fight Test' is a nice bit of uplifting poppy brilliance that stands on it's own (you may have noticed it on the 2002 season finale for HBO's Six Feet Under).<br />The songs that the album is named for are most likely non-toxic byproducts of Wayne Coyne's imagination (Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Parts 1 and 2). Part 1 tells us the story of our Asian female hero set with an acoustic guitar and other electronic beats and noises swirling around. Part 2 has no lyrics just fast paced hard hitting crazy electro-fighting music, which I would assume is the actual battle. <br />In conclusion, Yoshimi is both similar and different from the Soft Bulletin. You'll just have to hear it to really understand. Yoshimi deserves to stand on its own as yet another great record made by a truly great band. All I have left to say is \\"WOW!\\".
B000068PQ0|5.0|It's been five years since an album came out wherein every single track combined solid songwriting and innovative, complex recording that pushed the boundaries of what we expect from an album.<br />That last album was Radiohead's o.k. computer.  Unlike that album, however, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots has a message of hope and love.  It is every bit as beauteous and loving as its predecessor (the Soft Bulletin), but at the same time zippier and more fun.  <br />If you want to hear this entire album before you buy it, it's available as an online streaming audio file ... .  But I warn you that if you hear it, you will buy it.
0783232039|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out on a fantastic movie. But I suggest watching the Child's Play movies in order, so you know what is going. I have two favorite Child's Play movies. My two favroites are Child's Play 2 and The Bride Of Chucky. I think that the beginning of The Bride Of Chucky is so funny. I can't wait until Child's Play 2 and The Bride Of Chucky come out on DVD next month, which I plan on buying. <br />If you haven't seen the Child's Play movies I suggest going to your local video store and renting them. Once you rent the movies you will want to buy them, I sure did. <br />My first DVD I bought is Child's Play. I first bought my DVD player because I couldn't find Child's Play on VHS in the stores to buy, but I could find it on DVD. I even have my own Chucky doll (the doll came from a claw machine). Chucky rocks!! <br />I think that Brad Dourif did a fantastic job at playing the role of Charles Lee Ray/Chucky. <br />I just bought the Child's Play 3 DVD from eBay, which is NOT available on DVD in North America. The DVD is a PAL DVD, NOT all DVD players in the USA are PAL compatible. I know that the Apex company makes a NTSC/PAL DVD player which is the player that I have. So if you plan on buying Child's Play 3 on DVD you will have to buy it from either the United Kingdom, Austraila or Scotland.<br />Chucky is the *BEST*
B000068QY7|5.0|This is a great album if you are a fan of Oasis, and if you are a casual listener who liked their mid-90's work, you'll probably like it too. This album is filled with some great tunes that make you forget that Creed and Nickelback rule the airwaves of commercial radio stations. The Hindu Times makes you turn up the volume and wail along, and Better Man ,what can I say?  This is the closest the band will come to glam rock, and it works. I think the NME review said it best when they stated that after a listen to \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" we seem to forget that is isn't 1994 anymore... As for the ever present criticism that they steal from the Beatles, get over it. I am a huge Beatles fan, but I have the good sense to accept a good song when I hear it. Let's face it, Nick Drake was a genius but he took elements of Dylan. The Hives and the Strokes are the newest indie darlings but I hear The Stooges and the Ramones in there, is anyone complaining? The answer is no, why...because they make good music. Face it, all artists take elements from their heros. Why doesn't popular radio harass Lifehouse, they blatently rip off Creed and both of them are terrible bands. At least Oasis has taste in who they rip off...
079284131X|5.0|I love horror movies. Child's Play is one of the best movie series ever made. My first DVD I bought is Child's Play.

B00005Q3TZ|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie, so I won't bother with the negative reviews of it from critics and viewers.  In the VISTA version, I wanted to see what the director's cut would include, plus the extras that come with the higher price.  I was largely, but not entirely, satisfied.<br />Unlike that of the 60th Anniversary Edition that came out in December 2001, the packaging of the VISTA version was clumsy and less durable.  The storage section for the four DVDs was not very convenient to open and close.  The booklet that came with my copy was already falling apart.  Apparently, the glue holding it together dried up or something.<br />Some of the extras were welcomed, like the four postcards.  But others make one think if the extra money you ponied up to get this version was worth what you got in return.  Inside the front cover, there is a copy of the speech President Roosevelt gave in declaring war on Japan.  Holding together the four postcards is what appears to be part of a belt buckle.  Are these the best that Touchstone can manage for the higher price?<br />I would have preferred that the movie itself fit on one disc, and include a significant amount of never-before-seen footage.  But the only new stuff were the slightly more vulgar language and additional gore.  One would expect more from a director's cut.  Nonetheless, the extra features inside the DVDs largely make up for the VISTA version's shortcomings and the extra money spent.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I heard the title track on the radio and asked my friend who it was, &quot;some 20-yearold&quot; and my mind immediately rushed back to the first time I heard Beth Orten - that delight at recognizing the maturity which is innate in any really good artist. However, there couldn't be a greater difference between NJ and BO in terms of style; Beth to me is edgy while Nora is the songbird. What a fabulous voice: dreamy, warm, sheets of honey dripping on starved lips. Wonderful stuff, can't wait for more.
B00005K3OT|2.0|'Chocolat' wants to be a charming, enjoyable, heartfelt experience, sort of like strawberries dipped in melted chocolate. Sadly, it somes off more like a Sneakers Bar. It's about a mysterious woman who blows into town and sets up a chocolate store. The woman, Vianne, is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. So, of course, she is hated by people that art not. There is an intolerant, unhappy mayor who forces the local priest to read his sermons who hates Vianne because she would not listen to one of his sermons. Vianne uses her chocolate confections to fix problems in peoples lives and messes around with Johnny Depp without any real chemistry.<br />If you like things light and fluffy (possibly like a Three Musksteers), then this movie is for you. If you like things more dark and flavorful then please watch \\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\"
B000068PQ0|5.0|Producer Dave Fridman continues to make the most interesting sounding records of our time.  To recap, the beauty of Mercury Rev's &quot;Deserter's Songs&quot; was followed by the brilliant Lips album &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;.  Then Mr. Fridman follows that with Mercury Rev's amazing follow up &quot;All Is Dream&quot;, and now, The Flaming Lips have returned with another brilliant album, &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot;.  This album grooves a little more that &quot;Bulletin&quot; and is a brilliant and worthy follow up.  Fans of &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; need not hesitate in purchasing this album.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005OAIE|4.0|You know... I first saw the video for \\"No Such thing\\" on VH1, and, like Mr. Wright, I dissmissed him as a DMB wannabe, with an unoriginal voice and sound. However, at some point, the song took hold of me, and I just kept listening to it over and over again. Within a week or two I just went out and bought the damned thing. <br />Once again, at first I was unimpressed with the softer sound of Mayer, conpared to Dave's loud, edgy sound. However, soon I learned the lyrics, which are refreshingly in the front cover, whereas most musicians do not do that. Anyway, I fell in love with \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" because I totally identify with it. <br />Now, I will tell you that I am in love with his debut album. I am a total teen pop freak, with 3 NSYNC CD's permanantly in my CD player... John Mayer has now joined their ranks. I love this album, and every song on it. ... John Mayer writes about things that we all experience, and basically calling him an adolescent musician does not do Mayer, or the album justice.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I really like this album. It is unfair to compare it to The Soft Bulletin. It has Wayne Coyne spewing ultra-profound lyrics as usual and super ultra production from Dave Friedman. I've only heard the album about once, but the stand out tracks are:<BR>Flight Test<BR>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots<BR>Yohimi Battles the Pink Robots pt 2(featuring Yoshimi from the Boredoms)<BR>Are you a Hypnotist?<BR>Do You Realize?<BR>All We Have Is Now<br />They are my favorite band, so I can't help but be biased, but I think whoever likes artists like Radiohead and Bjork pick it up.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I first saw this movie knowing nothing about it except that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were in it.  I was completely blown away and am sad that I only got to see it three times in a movie theatre.  I have since seen it countless times on my DVD player. :D<br />There are so many things I love about this movie that it's difficult to put into a string of coherent sentences.  The colors, oh, the colors!  Luhrmann uses color effectively to try and emphasize the atmosphere.  He fades them out when things are bleak and brings them in to an almost life-like vibrancy when emotions swell.  It's as if he taps into your imagination and makes the world a brighter (or darker) place like you were right there with the characters.<br />Then there was the music.  In using established works, Luhrmann drew some criticism from those who love traditional opera/musicals, but I thought it worked.  It's the words he's after.  By using popular songs, I didn't have to spend too much time trying to figure out the lyrics.  Instead, I focused on how the words fit the scene.  The effect was even better when the actors sang and I was delighted to find that they had singing talent.  I was surprised that Kidman had such a strong, almost old-fashioned type of voice.  McGregor melts hearts with his crooning voice; you feel it when he's in pain and feel warm when he sings of love.<br />For lovers of the movie, the DVDs will delight.  The bonus disc is filled with all sorts of goodies including many easter eggs, production and design notes, behind the scenes looks at the dancing and music, and a plethora of other things.  <br />An over the top movie?  Maybe.  Silly?  Definitely.  But isn't that how it goes when you're in love?
6305308659|5.0|The idea of keeping innocent, orthodox Pleasantville in black and white was a better than any special effect that i could think of. It is a true shame that this film didn't win an academy award for cinematography.Then the idea of a more guilty Pleasantville becoming colorful, like the real world. This was absolutely a mastery of cinematography.
B00000K2SC|5.0|It's been awhile since I've seen the movie so I'm not going to comment on specifics.  My review is for someone who hasn't seen this movie, if there is anyone.<br />This movie overwhelmed me in how awesome it was.  I hadn't read hardly any reviews but had seen the commercials that asked &quot;What is the Matrix.&quot;  So, watching the movie, I was curious.  Then I saw that his wasn't just another average science fiction movie.  The special effects were awesome, the story was creative and thought provoking, and the acting was pretty good.<br />This ground breaking movie totally blew away my expectations and that's hard to do these days when it is so easy to find out everything about movies before they even come out.
B00006690G|5.0|The eminem show is a wonderful cd.  i can't say it is better than his other cds because his talent on all his cd's are just amazing.  this cd gives more of a personal outlook of his life.  again he expresses how ridiculous kids who follow what he says are.  my favorite song on the cd is \\"soldier.\\"  if you havent done so already and you are an eminem fan, get this off the hook album.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor is just like Titanic.  Both movies tell the story of a terrible true-life events.  To make it interesting, they throw it a love triangle that is destined to end in tragedy.  For somereason, everyone loved Titanic while Pearl Harbor was loathed by critics.  I liked Pearl Harbor better, but not by much.<br />The action and special effects are great and Pearl Harbor has nothing to be ashamed of in this regard.  I do believe the movie needed a human interest story to make us care more about the characters.  But that is where this movie fails.  They try to hard to create conflict between Afleck and Hartnett, when there is already enough conflict around.  There should have been one man and one woman, with the coflict revolving around whether or not he survives.<br />This is a good movie but not one I would want to see again.  Still it is better than the overrated Titanic.
B00005JLDW|5.0|This is such a cool movie! It's got wonderful special effects. The Dragons are very frightening. Is a post-apocolyptic monster movie with enough heroism, humor, and hunk to satisfy all kinds of taste. My favorite part was how totally gorgeous Gerard Butler and Christian Bale are in this movie. I enjoyed getting to see Gerard Butler in this movie. He was funny and cute and a great good guy. But it is good for guys and gals alike. Lot's of action, lot's of fun, just enough romance (just a little).
0684833395|5.0|Everyone must read this book.  I had to buy a new copy because mine got all ratty from carrying it around and yelling phrases at people in the mall
B000056K04|2.0|with little to no pessimism or doubts about the ability and loaded potential that DMB holds as they head into the coming years, i think Everyday is an unfortunate slipup and if anything an experimentation with a forced and awkward style that's seemingly brought in more for marketing than for inspiration. The hope I'm left with is that the band will evolve through music that is willfully theirs, more like the Lillywhite and Busted Stuff tracks, and every recording made prior to Everyday. A few listenable songs but nothing making it worthy of a new purchase.

B00005JKLZ|2.0|Being a huge fan of the original, I rushed to the theatre to see the remake, and was sadly dissappointed. The movie became empty summer fodder very quickly. <BR>The Time Machine was a remake of the classic of the same name by H.G Wells that is widely known and loved science fiction. The director, Simon Wells, is actually H.G Wells' great grandson. The story captured the imaginations of all who view it, and the remake is a sad special effects bonanza with a dumbed-down plot that hardly keeps up with the astounding unique story and theme of the original. <BR>Guy Pearce of the suprise hit Memento sells out as the inventor of the time machine with a completely different reason for building the time machine and using it. Instead of being a brilliant scientist and going through time for the sake of curiosity, he creates it to save his fiancee from death and ends up going into the far future purely accidentally, only feeding into the cookie-cutter summer movie love interest. At this point, he cannot save his love because the movie states that paradoxes cannot occur (an example of a paradox would be if you kill your mother, you wouldn't be born, so you couldn't go back in time and kill your mother, so you would be born; an endless loop). But in the end, he saves the world through a paradox, negating the point of his original travel through time. <BR>Many great ideas are mentioned in the movie, but are never followed through with. We hear of different classes within the future-dwelling morlocks and never see more than two. We have a group of hunted people who decide to live on the sides of cliffs for no reason who speak perfect English even though the language has been lost for centuries, and to hear them stumped on certian words is just silly. <BR>Samantha Mumba makes her appearance as many pop artists are doing now. She was placed as one of the peaceful tribe-people in the future who helps Pearce in his adventures in the future. She speaks fluent English like she's been speaking it her entire life, although there is no one on earth who still speaks it. And Pearce's character never seems to be amazed with what he sees in the future. Electric cars, people talking out of a piece of glass, moon resorts, all are taken with stride and uninterest, which is very uncharacteristic of an inventor from the 1800s. <BR>Although I was happy to see the movie update quite a few of the original's classic special effects such as time-travel itself and the aging of everything around our protagonist. Even the skirts slowly raising as styles come and go in the store front windows was redone. Also, the new reason for Earth being almost destroyed is very creative and more appropriate than the original's nuclear blast theory. <BR>Overall, the movie is made to be a summer movie, but they should have just gone with an entirely new story, because time travel movies are hard to do right and believable, and they just changed too much to have this one live up to the original. If you haven't seen the original and can completely shut off your brain, this is worth a viewing purely for the visual effects, otherwise, go pick up the original or read the book.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|Although not exactly the ultimate Beatles album, this one comes pretty close. Some of the songs are missing (e.g. why include 'Love Me Do' but exclude 'Please Please Me'?) but the album is a fair reflection of their hits as defined by the music charts.<br />We sometimes forget that The Beatles are much more than Top 40 hits. In fact, some of their best songs are not even singles. This album is an excellent introduction to The Beatles, but for one to fully appreciate the significance of the Fabs, one needs to look at the full catalogue.<br />Their music will remain our anthems, long after The Beatles is no more.
0761536434|5.0|This book is awesome! It reads like a novel and I have had a hard time putting it down. This isn't boring history. It is history that reads like a story. Sprinkled throughout are numerous quotes from everyone who was anyone (even their secretaries). <br />Did you know that Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, is also the creator of the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant/arcade!<br />This isn't just who did what when but who stabbed who in the back, stole ideas, who sued who for what. I'll give you a taste from the book here:<br />\\"Atari also became a notorious Mecca of drug abuse. The Martin Avenue roller-rink facility smelled of marijuana. One ex-employee quipped that \\"you could get stoned just breathing the air coming out of the building.\\"<br />\\"...Roger Hector [a new employee] nervously took his place among the regulars. When he went to use the bathroom, he found empty syringes on the bathroom floor.\\"<br />My favorite...<br />\\"The personnel lady came in with a young candidate who had shown up on our doorstep. He was this real scuzzy kid. She said, \\"What shall we do?\\" I think I said, \\"We should either call the cops or talk to him.\\" So I talked to him.<br />The kid was a dropout and really grungy. He was 18 years old and he knew something.... He had a spark of brilliance. Don Lang, one of my engineers, was asking for a tech, so I said, \\"Great. I'll give you a job working for a real engineer.\\"<br />The next day Don came to me and said, \\"What did I do to deserve this?\\" I said, \\"You wanted a tech, you got a tech.\\" He said, \\"This guy's filthy. He's just obnoxious. And he dosen't know electronics.\\"<br />The kid worked out in the end. His name was Steve Jobs\\"<br />-Al Acorn, former \\"sort of\\" vice president of engineering, Atari Corporation<br />The only problem I have with the book is the same problem I have with most books that cover graphics. The lack of graphics! There is not a single screen shot of a single video game anywhere. There is a 10 page insert in the center of the book with photo's of the people behind the stories, which is great! But I think sprinkling some screen shots of the games throughout the book would have been greater. But then, come to think of it, how do you get a screen shot of Pong, 30 years later!<br />I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that the author, Steven L. Kent, is from my home town of Bothell, Washington.<br />Buy this book!
B000068QY7|5.0|Buy this disc and put it in the contraption that plays ths cds.  Crazy glue the door shut, press repeat, turn the volume all the way up and throw the remote out the window.  Turn on the AC cuz its' gonna get hot...real hot.  The steaming hot first track is nothing less than a full blown orgasmic ear-orgy.  How do you do it Oasis?  \\"The Hindu Times\\" is greatness on the shelf with \\"Live Forever,\\" but in a cleaned up, mature, and an off the pint while recording kind of way.  If you break up the phases of your life according to Oasis releases, then the hindu times will someday be known as the good old days.  I have long been saying that Oasis is the only band worth listening to and these heathens proved it again with a succulent fat steak of a cd.  Listen to it with a fork and wipe your sloppy gibs with a towel.  If I had to post one complaint, it would be the picture of Noel's stupid haircut(why do you do it Noel?), while Liam is sporting the fabulous Oasis hair.  Buy this, or don't, I don't care, and throw all your other junk away.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Ugh, I could of made a better collection of their hits with my eyes closed randomly pointing to songs.  Where's Run Like Hell?  Where's Atom Heart Mother?  Where's Dark side of the FREAKIN moon?  It does have some good stuff though, I'll give it that much.  But if you're new to Pink Floyd, buy Atom Heart mother or The Wall or Dark side, not this album.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie absolutely blew my mind. After i saw it for the first time, I could not stop thinking about it. It is fast-paced and uniquely filmed and the performances are great. Anyone interested in mind-bending films that involve the use of the brain and contain complex plot structures should definately see this film. Anyone who [isn't] and can only be entertained by movies where someone is whipping out pistols and shooting people off of rooftops should not.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is the greatest song ever made.  I promise you that you'll never hear anything that even comes close to it.  This is BY FAR the greatest Pink Floyd album, and Atom Heart Mother is BY FAR the greatest song I've ever heard.
B000063UR2|4.0|O.K. This movie was before Tom made it really big in Hollywood so don't get upset at his crooked teeth. Ridley Scott creates a beautiful world with stunning cinematography and landscape. Mia Sara is really good and Tim Curry Dawns the figure of Darkness absoultely perfect.<BR> But the real story isn't actually the plot itself it is taking in this breathtaking world Ridley Scott has created and losing yourself in it.<BR> This ultimate edition has two versions of the movie (American,International) along with tons of extra stuff packed into it. If you like fairies and gnomes and goblins and all that stuff, you will enjoy this movie, guaranteed<br />p.s. Ridley Scott's commentary is pretty interesting. YOu learn a great deal more about the movie.
B00005JHAD|4.0|I was irritated with the first half hour or so of this movie, as it looked like yet another attempt to rip-off Quentin Tarantino.  This is not always bad, since it would be nice if Tarantino released a movie once in awhile.  But this one started off to me as a blatant imitation, with it's low-life gangsters with fancy nicknames spouting off intricate dialog.  And that's when you can understand a word they are saying, especially Brad Pitt.<br />But once the plot gets established and the cast is able to gel, I enjoyed watching it, and was wondering how certain situations were going to be resolved.  The movie is still Tarantino-ish, in that every character is a crook.  The two major capers here involve the theft of a diamond that could choke a buffalo.  The people interested in this rock are also involved in an underground fight game, ironically involving Brad Pitt, who still has his physique from the orgininal \\"Fight Game\\".<br />Now the fights themselves are an interesting situation.  They seem to be popular, and of course have a lot of betting action on them.  But they all also seem to be fixed, which you would think would keep serious bettors away once the word gets out.  But when the fix doesn't always work, then those putting money on it would have to be betting if the fix was \\"legit\\" or not.  <br />Which is why it gets interesting after awhile.  Brad Pitt enters the fight game after pulling a scam to sell a mobile home to some of the fight flunkies, one of which is a star fighter.  When the scam is discovered, the fighter takes on Pitt, and Pitt immediately cleans the guy's clock. <br /> Faced with needing a fighter or literally getting fed to pigs ala \\"Hannibal\\", they recruit Pitt to take his place, under the condition that he has to take a dive in the fourth round.  When Pitt's ego/stupidity results in another easy win, it sinks the surrounding mob guys into further pig doo doo.  <br />I am not giving anything away here because the setup of the movie is that for the NEXT fight, Pitt is instructed to dump again.  Whether he does or not I will leave to your viewing, as they leave it unclear until the very end whether Pitt is going to play ball this time or not, and what will be the aftermath depending on that decision.  I thought all of this was very well handled.  <br />Throughout all of this is intertwined the caper of \\"diamond, diamond, who's got the diamond\\".  This all involves Benicio del Toro as the guy unfortunate enough to have it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, a psycopathic Russian to whom the handcuffs are not a barrier, Dennis Farina who comes in from America, and three bumbling characters who don't seem to know what to do with it when they have it.  If one considers this all fun, then this is one fun movie.
6305041156|4.0|Fans of Kurosawa's black and white samurai films starring the incomprable Toshiro Mifune will find this film to be their equals. An Adaptation of Shakespeares King Lear, Kurosawa's take on the play is extraordinary. A stunning Japanese film with very vivid colors and superb shots of the japanese landscape, architecutre and culture. Akira Kurosawa pulls no punches in creating this modern masterpiece.<br />New audiences to Kurosawa's films will be stunned, and old fans will be spellbound at the DVD quality. A must have for anyone who enjoys great movies.<br />p.s. Lady Kaede is one of the most wicked characters in modern film history.
0553266306|5.0|It's been a lot of years since I read this book.  I was curious to see how it would hold up in today's world.  After all Charles de Gaulle is long dead, and most of the characters in the movie have World War II as their biggest memory.  No computers are part of the plot.  And this was before the James Bond gimmickry.  How could it possible stand up?<br />Well, it did.  If writers and moviemakers today could get it through their heads that a tight, suspensful plot is much better entertainment than any gimmick, we'd have a lot more books as good as this one.  Of course, the biggest challenge to the book is that we know in advance that the plot is going to fail.  This, of course, is the story of a plot to kill French president de Gaulle in the early sixties by hiring an anonymous assassin to do it.  Why even bother reading a book when we know in reality that de Gaulle died a natural death, and we even know that the killer will fail in the story?<br />The secret is to give you the intricate details of who, what, when, where, why, and how.  Without getting boring.  The book starts by giving some historical background about why some French citizens think their country would be in better shape if their president were murdered.  You see the problems of hiring the correct person to do the job, when these people aren't exactly in the Yellow Pages.  You see the man chosen, and get to follow as the assassin puts together the tools to do his job.  And that's all in Part 1.<br />After all of this, you would wonder what's left, but Part 2 is just as interesting.  Through a garbled confession of a captured \\"revolutionary\\", they deduce that indeed, someone has been hired to kill the president of France.  Problem is, there is absolutely no name or description of this person.  How the killer is tracked is almost as interesting as killer putting together his tools.<br />But I'll reveal they don't catch him in Part 2, because then, how would we have Part 3?  This is where the police by now knows what he looks like, and even exactly when and where the assassination is going to take place.  The killer also knows the police know.  Yet the plot moves swiftly and ingeniously, and gets so close to completion you almost applaud the killer.  This is a top notch story that should be read by anybody that likes suspense thrillers.  In any era.y now knows what he looks like, and even exactly when and where the assassination is going to take place.  The killer also knows the police know.  Yet the plot moves swiftly and ingeniously, and gets so close to completion you almost applaud the killer.  This is a top notch story that should be read by anybody that likes suspense thrillers.  In any era.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush is a band with true talent! They brought something different that has forever changed the way that we look at music today with this album! The band consist of Geddy Lee on vocals and bass, Alex Lifeson on guitar, and Neil Peart on drums. Geddy Lee is one of the best singers that you have ever heard! Sometimes you have to wonder how he hits those high notes! Geddy is my favorite bass player! He is excellent! His bass playing fits right along with Alex's guitar playing and Neil's drumming! Alex is one of the many great guitar players out their! Neil is the god of drumming! This album itself is one of the most musical that you will ever hear!<br />Track One:Tom Sawyer is the hit that broke Rush through! With its memorable lyrics and never before heard sound it is no wonder why this song was a hit for the early eieghtys! After a while Geddy plays a keyboard which really fits this song well!<br />Track Two:Red Barchetta is one of the many great songs on this album! Alex's guitar playing is amazing at the beginning but, it just gets even better when it begins to get heavy! Geddy's bass playing gives alot of rythm and melodie to the songs! It is almost like the next song is better or more musical than the last!<br />Track Three:YYZ is an all musical song that starts off very heavy for the early eieghties with alex's guitar playing but, then Neil comes in on drums and it makes you want to bang your head! You cannot forget about Geddy though because,without Geddy the band just isn't complete! When Alex starts his solo this song just keeps getting better and more melodic by the second!<br />Track Four:Limelight was another huge hit for this album and has great lyrics to go along with it! Neil beats the drums to a pulp at the end of this song and makes quite an impression to any drummer that is influenced by his playing!<br />Track Five:The Camera Eye starts off with a keyboard and Neil's drumming but, once the drums get heavy Alex's guitar playing comes in! Once they stop playing Neil plays those drums like you have never heard anyone play drums before then you get alot rythmic qualities by listening to Geddy's bass playing and after awhile this becomes one of your favorite songs on Moving Pictures!<br />Track Six:Witch Hunt starts off kinda scary to some people but, once you hear Alex's guitar playing and Geddy's voice you will be a bit overwhelmed! In my opinion Geddy is one of the best vocalist ever and these guys also know how to write good lyrics!<br />Track Seven:Vital Signs is the last track on Moving Pictures so enjoy! This is an  incredible song with unmatched bass playing and sound it is no wonder why Rush are one of my favorite bands of all-time!<br /> Rush are a huge influence on true musicians like myself because, they are one of the most musical bands ever! They should be inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame! If you think that bands like Crazy Town have talent then you are a poor worthless piece of slime that will never know what true talent is. Real talent is Rush! They produced this album and they play all kinds of different instruments! Get this album if you want to know the true meaning of the word musicianship!
B000000OTU|3.0|First of all, if you are looking for the BEST compilation of Aerosmith's &quot;second coming&quot; (the Geffen years, 1985-1994), then I would recommend the two-disc &quot;Anthology&quot; (2001), which includes all the songs here, digitally remastered, and some other good tunes that did not make the hit lists.  If you want to go further into that era, I would then recommend &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1987) and &quot;Pump&quot; (1989).<br />Second, if you are a passing fan looking for the BEST compilation of ALL of Aerosmith's music, I would recommend the newly-released &quot;Oh . . .&quot;, which contains many of these songs remastered, the early classics (&quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, etc.), and hits from the records that were released after this compilation (&quot;Don't Want to Miss a Thing&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love&quot;, &quot;Pink&quot;, &quot;Jaded&quot;, etc.)
B000066I6N|5.0|Robert Plant has succeeded brilliantly with this new album. It combines blues, psychedelic and rock influences in a fresh, imaginative way. He's found some really top-notch young musicians to work with, who bring a serious modern vibe to these reinterpreted classics of the 60s, plus a few new cuts. The effect is a thoroughly modern-sounding fusion, with the added 'bottom' provided by Robert's powerfully soulful delivery. It reconfirms both his stature as a major artist, and his relevance as a modern musician.
0790740443|4.0|I can't even count how many times I got sucked into this film, I must have watched the thing a dozen times now and enjoyed every one.  I'm not meaning to, but it's on the Dish or I just feel like an action flick and there you go.  It's a great action film and portrays a soldier's transformation to human.  I agree with some of the other reviews that Kurt does a remarkable job portraying his role without ever saying much at all, that was on purpose - a part of the character.  It has one of the all-time great lines when confronted with the fact he was wildly outnumbered and asked what he was going to do.  He turns and doesn't even blink and says \\"I'm going to kill them all.\\"
B00005QW5X|2.0|I can see how this film would be popular with a certain audience.  Hedwig is one of those cutsey/artsy films that is clearly in origin intelligent enough to be really great but seems so caught up in its gimick rather than getting down to telling a story that in the end I couldn't consider this film anything more than a failure.<br />True, there are plenty of films that don't have half the talent that Hedwig does, but its just that promise with a failure to deliver that's so frustrating.  So, let's itemize this nonesense:<br />1.  If you don't love the music, forget it.  The obvious nods to Bowie are certainly enjoyable, but the music literally pads out over half the movie.  In a true musical, we actually have the narrative of the story explained and strengthened through the songs.  At times it feels like Hedwig was doing this but most of the time it seems like they were having more fun doing fake music performances.  Why not just watch Spinal Tap instead?  Because the songs take up the majority of the film and bring the tiny amount of narrrative flow in the movie to a near standstill, unless you're absolutely enthralled with the music in Hedwig, the film can't help but dissapoint.<br />2. What I was waiting to develop during all those songs was a great story that just didn't happen.  I was actually interested in main character and many of the unexplained side characters.  The fact that hedwig was a TRUE freak among a profession of poesers was absolutely fascinating.  Did the movie bother to explore any of this?  Absolutely not.<br />3. What we get instead of an actual resolution to the nonexisting story is a rather inept attempt at a freak-out ending, complete with sets that were formerly all black changing to all white, Hedwig rips off his/her close, walking around near naked and looking identical to his love/hate boyfriend Tommy.  There's supposed to be something deep with how men and women used to be one being and were split, but it feels as though it was carriedoff so incompetantly or simply incompletely that whatever message the director was intending feels utterly lost--meaning that really the last 20 minutes are essentially a waste.<br />I'm left wondering why this film has received such a high rating and so many positive reviews.  Where other films have explored similiar grounds with much greater effectiveness, Hedwig seems only capable of raising them, singing about them, but then gives up.  Or perhaps it was just one big music video?  Hedwig certainly isn't the worst film I've seen by any measure, rather, it isn't a movie.  Just a pretentious artsy pile posing as one.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this.  While I was always a big fan of the novel and the George Pal movie, I felt this film offered its own jewels.  Compared to the original film, I felt the characters were much more developed and real.  There was a reason for making the Time Machine.  The additions of future technology were done very well and am entertaining change.  There are several tribute scenes to the original but being a book-lover I miss the return to his time to retrieve his beloved books that the future had let decay.  But overall, I found it very enjoyable and it will grace my collection, the best compliment I can give.
B000068QY7|4.0|I haven't been much of a Oasis until I bought this album. Ya they have had some great hits, but it wasn't until I heard &quot;Born On A Different Cloud&quot; when my opinion of these guys changed. This CD is very very good. Songs like &quot;Little By Little&quot;, and the single &quot;The Hindu TimesMusic&quot; make it a fun &amp; fast rock trip. The slower songs like, &quot;Songbird&quot; make it a great CD to just listen to when your working.<br />Overall I think this CD is awesome, keep on rockin' Oasis!
6305291446|4.0|Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) didn't even know she had a brother, until he tried to kill her on Halloween night of 1978.  She knew about psychotic killer Michael Myers, of course, as did everyone in her neighborhood of Haddonfield, Illinois, who killed his older sister when he was only six years old and was incarcerated in the state loony bin, but she didn't know she was related to Michael because she was relocated and given a name change after the brutal crime.  Laurie was seventeen when Michael escaped and tried to kill her off, the sole surviving member of his original family.  He didn't succeed, but he did massacre a number of her friends and assorted others who got in his way.  Michael was presumed dead after that night of mass murder, but his body was never found.<br />Laurie faked her death and changed her name again, this time to Keri Tate, and became the headmistress of a posh private prep school.  The years have not been kind to her.  At age thirty-seven, her husband has divorced her, and her seventeen year old son John (Josh Hartnett) finds her overprotectively paranoid.  She's an alcoholic, to boot.  She's always been certain Michael will return one day to finish off old business, and with his obsession about murdering all his kin, John will be next in line after her.<br />Just as she's beginning to learn to trust again with new beau Adam Arkin, and starting to lighten-up on watching over her son, her worst fear becomes a reality.  Michael has found out her new identity, and tracked her down.  And, needless to say, the intervening years have done nothing to improve his disposition...<br />This is a great script, well-acted and -directed and handsomely produced.  It has more tension than any entry in the series, except for the first.  The action is plenty nasty.  There are a number of terrific camera shots, the best being of Laurie and Michael's first face-to-face confrontation through a porthole-style window.  The music score is excellent, making marvellous use of the famous original John Carpenter/Alan Howarth theme and adding new dimensions to it, though that actual theme is oddly underused during the gripping finale.  The opening credit sequence and music is phenomenally good, panning and cross-dissolving over headline clippings of Michael's previous reign of terror and Laurie's sad history, while an actor doing a near-perfect impersonation of the late Donald Pleasance (Michael's doctor, from the preceding entries) narrates highlights of the same.  The ending of the movie is especially surprising and satisfying.<br />The best thing about this film, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' mature performance of a woman barely coping with the lasting scars of deep trauma, which is credibly and sensitively handled.<br />Unfortunately, another sequel (Halloween: Resurrection) followed this perfect conclusion to the popular series, though that doesn't diminish H20's stature.  Even those who've never seen any of the other entries will enjoy it, on its own merits.
B00004T0UT|5.0|Simply put, this is Elvis' best album. This is a great matching-one of the best voices ever paired with the memphis sound of the late sixties. Quality songs, great vocals, quality music. The King lives...
B00004XQ83|5.0|I bought this album last fall, right after the 9/11 attacks. When other people were singing God Bless America endlessly or listening to that insipid country patriotic song (Proud to Be an American or something like that) I found myself listening to this album over and over again. Music like this reminds me what I really love about America...it captures the essence of the American soul. <br />Stand out tracks for me are Down to the River to Pray which is inspiring. I also love Didn't Leave Nobody But the Babe...a beautiful arrangement of an old African-American lullaby. There has been some carping in reviews about pieces like Po' Lazarus and Lonesome Valley being included, but I like them alot as examples of really authentic southern African American folk music. (Yes, I listen to all of those Folkways albums recorded by Alan Lomax. Love that non-commercial authentic stuff!) Ralph Stanley is riveting in Oh, Death. <br />Yes, perhaps we don't need four versions of Man of Constant Sorrow, but I find that each one makes a slightly different statement. I was amazed particularly to find that this bluegrass classic can have such an African American sound. The South was musically more of a melting pot than people liked to let on. <br />Above all, this is music that connects with our American roots. For me, folk music is almost spiritual...something about connection with the ancestors. Most of this stuff is freed of the glitzy packaging that you find in contemporary country and even bluegrass albums. This is hardcore mountain music...connects us to our roots.
B000001ES9|4.0|Alot of people think RUSH sounded like LED ZEPPELIN when they first started out, but I don't! I think RUSH sounded more like UFO than any other band! RUSH's first album is pretty darn loud and awful darn good!<br /><br />While much has been said about what great musicians they were, I also think they were very talented songwriters! There are a number of classic heavy metal/hard rock songs here! My personal favorite is NEED SOME LOVE. Tis a very short, but very catchy and loud hard rock tune! LIFESON solos<br />his hiney off on this album, especially on the album's closing track, the heavy metal masterpiece WORKING MAN. I hear a HUGE BLACK SABBATH influence on this song in LIFESON's power chording and in some of his soloing, but this song also reminds me very much of the UFO song ROCK BOTTOM.<br /><br /> IN THE MOOD is a narsty little song; a short hard rock-n-roller that sounds a bit like KISS and AEROSMITH in it's raunchiness. BEFORE AND AFTER is the one song on here that would indicate the musical direction RUSH would go in on their next three albums, with it's soft acoustic opening. It's really a terrific song! I also love the track WHAT YOU'RE DOING, with it's gargantuate guitar and bass riff and LEE'S echoey vocal performance.<br /><br /> It's not all great; for some reason I've never liked FINDING MY WAY, even tho' it's a big fav amongst RUSH fans. I also have never liked the tune TAKE A FRIEND. It's too noisy, man! GEDDY wrote all the lyrics and basically sings about how narsty he feels and how he really needs alot of love, a WHOLE LOTTA LOVE(Ah, maybe that's where the ZEP influence comes in), but RUSH have never rocked out with such abandon as they did on their first album!
0671027344|5.0|This was a facinating story of a very innocent minded boy, named Charlie, who writes letters to an annoymous person.  The reader nor Charlie knows this person.  This is simply a person he heard would understand him.  He writes his most intimate details of his experiences with family, drugs, sex, crushes, hormones, and just trying to be a part of a group.  It is one year in the life of a teenage boy that will keep you reading from cover to cover.  The book is easy to read in the letter format.  Very good for struggling readers, it would give them the sense of accomplishment finishing letter by letter.  If the title of the book isn't enough to read this book maybe just wondering what is in his letters would be enough.  Curiosity of reading someone's private letters is intriguing.  This is a must read, it will take you back to your teenage years and all the drama.  Enjoy!
B000065U1N|4.0|Some may call it action with no acting, some may say it uses patriotism to make it better than it really is, but the truth is that Black Hawk Down is a gripping and realistic war movie that truly makes you feel like you are in it.<br />The movie follows a group of American elite forces who are on a routine mission in Mogadishu, Somalia.  But when two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down behind enemy lines, all hell breaks loose.  The first half hour of the movie is basically the acting part, but from then on it's pure action.  The movie manages to convey emotions even in the heart of non-stop action, and is truly an awesome war movie.  The camera work is genius, and action fans as well as war movie fanatics will be tremendously pleased.  Ridley Scott has just about cemented himself as one of the greatest directors of this time with this movie.  A truly epic movie!
0783225881|5.0|Over the years there have been many baseball movies. But no baseball movie will ever be like \\"Fields of Dreams\\". The story is about an Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) who one day, out of the blue, hears a voice. The voice keeps saying, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" But 'build what' and 'who' will come? Ray soon comes to realize that he must build a baseball diamond in his field. Unfortunately for him, no one believes him and thinks he's totally crazy. The only support he has is from his wife Anni (Amy Madigan) and his daughter Karin (Gaby Hoffmann). After he completes his baseball diamond, Ray meets the famous Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta). Also coming to meet Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham (Burt Lancaster), Ray learns that heaven is where your dreams come true.<br />A very interesting story, not at all what I though it would be. Though baseball is the 'theme' of the movie, baseball is in a way only a subplot of the story. In a way, \\"Field of Dreams\\" is a bit hard to tell 'what the story's about' but I assure you that once you watch it, you will enjoy it very much. Once you do see it, I recommend you read the trivia about the movie since it's very interesting to read about the history of American baseball and the 60's and how it relates in the movie.<br />The acting is pretty well done with Kevin Costner giving a terrific performance. It's also lots of fun to see two very legendary and amazing actors, Burt Lancaster and James Earl Jones. The humor is also well placed all the lines are delivered well. One of my favorites lines are:<br />Mark: \\"Admit it, Ray. You've never liked farming.\\"<BR>Ray Kinsella: \\"That's not true.\\"<BR>Mark: \\"It is true. You don't know the first thing about farming.\\"<BR>Ray Kinsella: \\"Yes I do. I know a lot about farming. I know more than you think I know.\\"<BR>Mark: \\"Then how could you plow under your major crop?\\"<BR>Ray Kinsella: \\"What's a crop?\\"<br />The whole movie is a very heartwarming experience and I can say that most anybody will enjoy the film. The movie is rated PG though because of some language so younger children are advised to watch with their parents. Plus, I think that younger children would find this type of movie a bit boring. For those who like Kevin Costner, here are a few more movies he has played in (the first two also being baseball movies):<BR>\\"Bull Durham\\"<BR>\\"For Love of the Game\\"<BR>\\"Silverado\\"<BR>\\"Dances with Wolves\\"
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I am so angry that Russell Crowe did not win an Oscar for his performance in A Beautiful Mind. This movie is seriously the movie of the year. Some may not agree but i just found this movie so interesting, exciting, and breathtaking. Russell Crowe is an excellent actor. One would think that he was the real john nash~! and Jennifer Connelly is just wonderful. THe make up and background is great.  I could feel tears in my eyes while i was watching this movie. I recommend everyone to purchase or borrow this movie~!! the DVD offers a lot of commentary and behind the scene footage~! it's worth the money so go get it today~!
0446677450|1.0|And so starts the moral and fiscal indoctrination of the ruling class... which is what this book (for me, on tape) espouses. It preaches exploitation and contempt for workers, underpaying them and pointing out the unfortunate fools to nine-year-old boys who are being groomed to carry on this shameful business. <br />A thoroughly distasteful premise, reinforced by the daily revelations of corporate malfeasance.<br />As a fellow former citizen of Hawaii, I say, \\"Eh, brah? What? No shame?\\".
B00005R2M3|5.0|To start with, I have to say that Shakira has an awesome voice that will just struck you and be addicted to her spanish hot voice. The CD are music combination of being sexy, wild and fun... you just got to listen to it!
B00005RDSM|5.0|To the second star on the right and you will reach Neverland! Where pirates rule the sea, the Native Indians are the civilized, and meet Peter Pan and his lost boys. This is a true Disney classic that everyone must have! And don't just get the VHS, GET THE DVD! The picture quality is much better, stronger, and sharper, talk about dpi high resolution! What's more interesting is that don't watch it on your TV for best resolution, watch it on your computer for the extreme! The features are great too, my favourite is the concept art archive, all these original sketches and paintings just make me want to drool. You won't believe the ability of these artists back in the 1950s. One of the interesting feature is the history of making of Peter Pan. It shows you how the musical was first started, and Disney transformed Peter Pan into a boy! Unlike the musical that is played by an actress (though the musical is excellent too).<BR>If you are a Disney fan I wouldn't doubt you will miss this DVD.
B000060OFT|4.0|Baz Luhrmann really did something extraordinary with this film! The story is just the same so the words are but they replaced sword with guns. Talk about flamingo style with guns! The setting has been moved from its Elizabethan origins to the futuristic urban backdrop of Verona Beach. You'll never regret seeing the modern WIlliam Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet!
B000068QY7|5.0|Some background: I was never really a die hard fan of Oasis. I was one of those rare ones who loathed Definitely Maybe. But Morning Glory was probably one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life. When Be Here Now came out, I wrote them off as a one album wonder (for me), barring occasional gems like Stand By Me and Don't Go Away. I didn't even bother with SOTSOG.<br />Morning Glory was precious to me because it invoked all the fabulous soundscapes built in the 60s and 70s that have been reduced to bubblegum and chaotic trash in the last 2 decades. This album, nevermind the 'blatant plagiarism', brings us back to those magical times when The Beatles spun tales of wonder for entire generations.<br />Plagiarism it may be, but it takes more than your usual rock talents to come up with gems like these. We could also similarly accuse the entire rock scene of the 60s and 70s of plagiarism as well. Who wasn't trying to play like the Beatles back then?<br />Sit down and enjoy the album without prejudices, and you will find yourself lifted to another realm detroyed by pop in the last 2 decades.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|THis soundtrack is the best there has ever been in my lifetime...Howard Shore is a great composer he brought Tolkien's world to life with music...my family and i enjoy the film and the music!!!

B000068PQ0|5.0|In 1980, the Rolling Stones released Emotional Rescue, regarded by many fans to be their worst album. The Stones had released a disco record, even after most people would agree that disco was dead.<br />Twenty-two years later, the Flaming Lips release Yoshimi. The Lips' once-electrifying instrumentation has been completely replaced with tired \\"trip-hop\\" beats and sterile, premeditated Radiohead synthetics. Not that long ago the Lips refused to play to a click track. Now very, very little of this record was even recorded with a microphone.<br />Maybe these songs will grow on me. I certainly hope so, because I love this band. If not, let's hope their next album is a Tattoo You.<BR>---------------------------<BR>UPDATE:<br />Okay, forget most of what I said above.<br />I was initially startled, and even put off, by the electronic flavor of the album and the simplicity of the songs.  But buy some new speakers, give it a few spins, listen very, very closely... the production is phenomenally subtle.  <br />While none of the songs are too wildly experimental, this is their most consistent effort since their epic Hit to Death in the Future Head.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I have been a fan of The Flaming Lips ever since their hit \\"Vaseline\\" played on the radio ages ago.  BUt ever since they released \\"The Soft Bulletin\\", my perspective has kinda changed, in the sense that I have come to appreciate their pure and utter genius in making music.  That was an excellent album, but \\"Yoshimi...\\" blows it out of the water.  This is by far the best album of the year so far, and I highly doubt anything else released could beat it out of my top spot.  From the very opening track, \\"Fight Test\\" to the closing \\"Approaching...\\", The Flaming Lips take us on a ride full of electronic landscapes, acoustic guitars, and very soothing vocals.  The album is a story of a small girl, named Yoshimi, who battles giant, mechanical monsters, hence the title.  Every track is like a chapter in a book, and it paints a better picture than any words could describe.  I thought that Wilco was the best \\"Kid A\\" wannabe out there, but this album almost reaches that plateau.  My favourite song has to be \\"Ego Tripping AT The Gates Of Hell\\", although, they are all masterpieces in their own sense.  By far the best album of the year.  Go buy it!! You won't be disappointed.
0385503954|1.0|I read reviews before buying this book and was excited to get reading.  About halfway through the book, and many yawns later I put this book down for good.  <BR>The plot was very unstimulating, I could have cared less as to what happened to any of the characters.  There was way too much discription and no real substance.  <BR>This book was a waste of money and a waste of time.
B00005QG9J|1.0|When did Incubus turn into Creed?  What a [terrible] album.  It's so bad that I can't even listen to their old albums anymore.
078322687X|5.0|If you've, uh, like ever heard, like, kids these days and they, you know, like talk among themselves and that sort of thing, like visiting or some stuff like that, can you, I mean, you know what I mean, do you ever hear them, uh, you know, talk like the five kids in this show, you know, with, like coherent sentences that have subjects and verbs and, like, uh, even adjectives and that sort of thing, you know?  I mean -- you know what I mean? -- like when some of them answered questions to the others and everything was, like, in whole sentences, and nobody, uh, ever stammered around and like got off the subject or anything like that, you know.  I guess that's because all these teenagers, uh, were like 22 years old or something, but I really like liked the movie, you know.
