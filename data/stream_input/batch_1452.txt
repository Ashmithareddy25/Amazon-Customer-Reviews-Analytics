B006TQUNX8|3.0|I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth.
B004132HZS|5.0|Season One of Sherlock was nothing short of brilliant.  Everything about it is so \\"right.\\"  Now that I have seen the first full 90 minute story of season two however I have to say that the series has fallen under the spell of the Robert Downey movies. The pace was brisk in season one. Now it's breakneck.  Far too many quick cuts are happening now and when Cumberbatch makes a deduction he now speaks so fast you literally can not understand what he is saying.  He didn't do that in season one.  Really a shame because there is still enjoyment to be had in Season two, it's just that now it's chasing the movies instead of just being it's own wonderful self.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an excellent set of books.  Fine story telling, good character development, and a plot that makes you not want to put it down. Can't wait for more work from this author in this particular fictional universe!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I just want to note that at the time of this review, the Amazon picture of this cooler shows it as having 2 fans. This is not accurate, only 1 fan is included(though for very cheap you can install a second one).<br /><br />I did deduct a star for this. Apart from that though, it's a decent cooler. Obviously this won't be suited towards extreme overclocking, but this will be nice to squeeze and extra 0.4-0.5GHz out of your CPU if you wish. Otherwise, it keeps it perfectly cool at stock frequencies.<br /><br />If you're looking for a high quality budget cooler, I recommend this. It definitely holds its own.
0345803507|5.0|One of the best books I have read!  Loved it!!!  The intimacy was erotic but fasinating at the same time.

Fantastic book, well written. I was so engrossed with this book and couldn't leave it down. Read it on holidays on the beach at Koh Samui.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but I've got to say after watching this film that this film was wonderfully done.  I won't get into details about the movie as others have done so.  This film does not have any gore or blood which does loose its taste.  It relies on its creepiness and suspense using darkness and its surroundings. You just have to imagine or pretend that you are Daniel Radcliffe's character exploring the haunted house. Once you do so, then you will feel what he feels throughout the movie. The scares did really give me a jump or goosebumps. I felt the acting was wonderful. You can feel the tense and suspense throughout the film as well as some emotions. I recommend this film highly for anyone who loves hauntings and ghost films. It is hard to come by a good ghost film nowadays and this is one of my favorite.  Enjoy!
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Based on a true story, Moneyball is a movie for anybody who has ever dreamed of taking on the system. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who assembles the team, who has an epiphany: all of baseball's conventional wisdom is wrong. Forced to reinvent his team on a tight budget, Beane will have to outsmart the richer clubs. The onetime jock teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that the scouts call flawed, but all of whom have an ability to get on base, score runs, and win games. It's more than baseball, it's a revolution - one that challenges old school traditions and puts Beane in the crosshairs of those who say he's tearing out the heart and soul of the game.
B00008977N|5.0|Better than I hoped for! Great audio-visual presentation from musician and showman Peter Gabriel.  In previous works he featured singing sensations like Kate Bush & Sinead O'Connor, in this video, we are blessed to see and hear the soulful Paula Cole. His passion for music entrances you to watch his musical influences transformed through through rhythm & soul.  I dare you to sit still the finale - In Your Eyes - you can't! It makes your want a pick up an instrument and play right there on stage! A must for any Peter Gabriel music fan!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down. However, there were parts that were a bit slow. There was a part about an animal crying that I wished would have been explained more. The surprise ending was shocking. I can't imagine going through that as a parent.
1580084621|5.0|Recently bought this book and it is amazing. I've tried 4 recipes. All of them turned out fantastic. The taste is authentic and brings me back during my time in Thailand. I have several Thai cook books and this is by far the best.<br /><br />This is not a book for beginners. Most of recipes take time and requires you to make a lot of things from scratch. For example, all curry paste are made from scratch. Most time spent will be with preparing the ingredients. It required a lot of chopping, roasting seeds, and using blender or mortar-and-pestle. Another challenge is some of the ingredients are hard to find. You need access to an Asian market and Indian market. I had to improvise and replace some of the ingredients.<br /><br />Despite this, the end result is worth it. The taste is so much better than buying ready-made paste. It also improved my cooking skills to a new level. I'm looking forward to try all the recipes in this book.

1433502445|4.0|I got this Bible because I wanted to take my Bible reading/studying to the next level. For the most part I love it and I've used it everyday since it arrived. I use the online version along with my actual Bible. I love that you get the online version as well as a physical one to use. I do all my highlighting and note writing on the online version. That way I can keep notes and highlight things that stand out to me but not mark up my Bible (I tend to get distracted by things I've previously written in my Bible when I go through it again). I love having the cross-references because they help me easily search for similar passages. The reason I only gave it four stars is there have been a few notes I've read where I feel that the scripture they use to back it up doesn't exactly get the point they were trying to across. The size of the Bible is also a down side, it's not easy to take with you to Church or Bible study. Over all I would recommend this Bible to anyone who wants a study Bible. It's a great Bible and a great version :).
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is an interesting world - a fantastical setting proves dystopian over time, but the future holds some hope for change (the omnibus edition contains the entire set of stories to date).  Howey has written believable and compelling characters - basic themes of love, friendship, loyalty - and what happens when loyalty conflicts with morality weave throughout the book. The plot has some surprises, and the narrative of the Wool universe unfolds over time.  Readers who enjoy mystery and science fiction should appreciate the plot unfolding and the occasional bouts of mechanical or technical detail - however, Wool isn't as tech-heavy in the description as, say, Alastair Reynolds or the Red Mars trilogy, so you want to head into it realizing the focus here is really on the people. I think in some cases, the narrative can lag a bit - there were times I felt that something had already been said sufficiently; that could just be personal taste, or it could be a newer author working through exactly how clear you have to be about ideas for them to get across. It didn't detract from the quality of the story or ideas but I didn't feel I could award 5 stars on that basis.  A very solid, enjoyable and occasionally surprising read.

B000IB1TWE|5.0|I'm not great at detailed reviews, so I'll keep it simple and straight-forward. Awesome story, acting, everything. Credited to sci-fi author Harlan Ellison but the produced version is very different from his original story. It's still a great tale. Basically, McCoy goes back in time to depression-era America, changes history and the Enterprise, UFP, everything that the crew and captain knows is gone. Kirk and Spock need to go back to stop McCoy from doing whatever it is he does. While back in time, Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler (a young Joan Collins). Don't want to spoil anything, so just get this and love it. I'm a first generation Trek fan (I watched the original run of the show) so trust me.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|This movie is a must-see, hands down.  Using extraordinary cinematography, no dialogue, it just captures different cultures throughout the world.  The sequel to this film, Samsara, is due out later this year and I can't wait for it.  This is my second favorite movie of all time!  It fills the viewer with wonderment and amazement for our beautiful world!  Very highly recommended.<br />A strong Five out of five stars!  I'd give this movie more stars if I could.

0345803485|5.0|I do not even know where to begin with this book. This is by far my favorite book of all times and I have read thousands of books.<br />Is it explicit, yes and I am not into BSDM. It is not about that. It is a love story and it just touches on the other. You have to look past the stuff that might make you blush and see what the rest is about. It's about a man with issues and a woman who can help with those.<br />I could not put this book down. I bought it on my kindle on a Friday and by Sunday night I was half way through the second book.READ THIS BOOK, IT IS TRULY AN AMAZING STORY. I will be sad when I'm done.
1463514581|5.0|I never in a million years thought this book would be so good.  It was fun, and I had a hard time putting it down.

B006GHA9VQ|3.0|I was very exited when I saw this blu ray for sale Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite musicals and I also love many of Andrew Lloyd Webber's works, I must say however that I am a little disappointed. Now some critics of this musical complain about the story but I think the story itself is fine. Most musicals do not really have that exiting stories, you see them for the music, take Cats for example is is basically about a bunch of cats having a party to determine which of them get to be reborn, there it is not so much going on but the music is awesome. Love Never Dies have a ok enough story for a musical, I actually got quite interested in it, and while it is just a basic love triangle story it is not bad. Basically what happens is that ten years after the end of Phantom of the Opera it is made clear that the Phantom survived, he Madame Giry and Meg have moved to New York and started a side show. In the meanwhile Christine have become a famous opera star but her marriage to Raul is in trouble as he has become a drunkard and have gambled away all of their money. Christine comes to New York to hold a concert to earn money for her husband and the story from there is rather predictable, but it works.<br /><br />The problem with this musical is the music itself, it is boring. Now there are few songs, mostly people sing what they are saying in a conversation, the problem is when there is no rhyme that just end up sounding forced, of the actual songs there is few is memorable. In Phantom of the Opera there are so many great songs, and they are catchy to, you can listen to them once and be humming them in the shower for weeks. In this new musical the only two songs I can really remember is Love Never Dies and Devil Takes The Hindmost, all else just is a mass of music, yes it is pleasant, it is nice to listen to, but it says absolutely nothing and is for the most part bland.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this musical is that everyone are A**holes. In Phantom of the Opera sure the Phantom was a villein but you could sympathize with him, this time around he is an obsessed idiot, Madame Giry and Meg do everything for him, Meg going so far as to prostitute herself so he could have the money to start his sideshow, and he toss them aside, he also threaten to kidnap Cristine's son. Raul who is the night in shining armor in the first musical is now a drunk, unpleasant fool which treat his wife and son as nothing, something which bothers be for off course it happens that the once night in shining armor turn out to be a jerk, however in a romantic story that sort of realism is not what you want to see. Meg Giry tries to kill a kid ad so on, I know I am mentioning some spoilers here but seriously why is all the characters portrayed this way. Now I love to see layered characters and even down right villains, but when everyone are jerks it get really hard to care for their fate in what is a love tragedy.<br /><br />One thing I do like in this musical is the set, the Phantom's sideshow is wonderfully strange and Gothic, everything look beautiful. I also love the actors, they can both act and sing and they do an amazing job, the little boy has a bit to squeaky voice but all in all the cast is amazing. Another thing I do like is that they never show the Phantom's face. Now this is something that bothers me in most film and musical versions of The Phantom of the Opera, there is really no way to do the make up properly. The Phantom is supposed to be so ugly that he makes people faint, even die of fright, but when they show his face they usually have just made him have a few scars, perhaps some unseemly birth mark. Now I know a few people which scars on their faces and they do not make you faint in fright. By just showing people's reaction to seeking the Phantom without his mark they convey so much more about the horror of it than if they had shown his face with cheap makeup.<br /><br />All in all Love Never Dies is pretty weak, the songs, the story and all of it can not hold a candle to Phantom of the Opera, when that is said the story is okey, the music, while bland is pleasant and there is a couple of good songs in there, the set is beautiful and the actors are good. If you really like musicals then this is worth a watch and I personally love that we get a continuation of the Phantom's story. If you are not a big musical fan however Love Never Dies will probably not change your mind for while it is okey it is far from great., the story and all of it can not hold a candle to Phantom of the Opera, when that is said the story is okey, the music, while bland is pleasant and there is a couple of good songs in there, the set is beautiful and the actors are good.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved this book.  Loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo as well; and this is continuing her story.  Now reading the 3rd book in this series.  Loved the movie of the first book and anxious to see the next one.  Have really enjoyed these books by Stieg Larsson.  A little difficult to read and keep up with at times, but so worth the time.
0060930349|5.0|A History of the American People is the most detailed and well researched history I have ever read, and I've read a lot. Mr. Johnson, a Brit, has an insight into our national character that natives can probably not match.<br />His identification of key developments in our history is excellent; his conclusions as to their importance and their effect on the nation's evolution is unsurpassed.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|This film promised to be a classic. Indeed, it should have been a classic. Unfortunately, once all the excellent cinematography is appreciated, the plot, the characters, the script, and the entire film descend into a cloying, maudlin, unwatchable abyss. Thirty minutes into the film, I was ready to abandon any hope for this film's salvation. It's all such a disappointment, that gorgeous piece of horseflesh notwithstanding.  Given a good storyline and script, as well as a hefty dose of editing, we could have one of the best films ever. And just as an afterthought, it wouldn't have hurt to tone down those annoying orchestral swells.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book I read was Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. In the beginning Percy and his class are on a fieldtrip to a museum. While there he gets attacked by a Fury. This is where he fist finds out that he is a demi-god and that he has special powers that allow him to read in Greek and see mythical creatures such as stayrs, Furys, and centaurs. After he survived his first attack, Percy goes home and tells his mom about what happened. Promptly she drives them in the direction of Camp Half-Blood, a camp that houses hundreds of other demi-gods just like Percy. Along the way Percy's mother gets attacked by a Minotaur and taken with him to the Underworld before Percy could kill it with his sword/pen Riptide. Percy wakes up inside the grounds of Camp half-blood where he is greeted by his former Latin teacher, who is really a centaur. During his time at the camp, Percy learns many things. A big moment for Percy is when he finds out that he is a son of Poseidon, the god of the sea. Throughout the book Percy has to learn the powers and special things being a son of Poseidon brings. Now Percy can heal himself in water, he can breathe underwater, and he can also cause water to become a tsunami for defense against enemies. Percy is given the quest to retrieve Zeus' stolen lightning bolt as to clear his name because Zeus is accusing Percy of stealing it himself. The initially think that the god of the Underworld, Hades, is the thief. So by going off of that hunch they travel to the entrance of the underworld. Along the way they face many mythical creatures such as Medusa, Echidna, and the Furies. But in the end it turns out that the real thief of the lightning bolt is Luke, one of Percy's fellow campers. He was under the control of Kronos, the god of Chaos, who was trying to rise from the Underworld and restore Chaos to the world.<br />I am really looking forward to watching the movie, now that I have finally read the book.

I can sum it up by saying it reminds me of a 300+ page Penthouse Forum letter

B0062OCNAI|1.0|Another of the \\"Mother Love Overcomes All\\" female fiction books so popular over the past three years. The theme crops up in hardboiled dectective fiction, too.  What is all this about mothering? I suspect that when readers of romance novels graduate from Young Adult fiction they eventually develop a taste for Mommie novels, especially near Mother's Day.<br />  This book is cleverly plotted but the main characters are absolutely unconvincing as disembodied entities who must solve an arson plot that succeeded in demolishing a private school and badly injuring a mother and two young girls. Once an author has written the ending first (she tells us that in the acknowledgments) she is left with a mother and daughter who are mere shadows of themselves--  characters who are unseen, unheard and unbelievable as they stalk various scenes, communicating only with each other. There is far too much gushing about feelings and far too little of the commonsensical stuff of daily life and its realities. Overwritten and overwrou;ght!
0439023513|4.0|I enjoyed this so much. It is a good series. It is fun, fast paced, always something happening, well written, intriguing, great characters and basically had everything you could want in a fantasy thriller. I took one star from this nearly perfect series because I felt the writing was too focused on young adults. I'm interested in reading more like this but written for adults.
1439133948|5.0|Bujold is a treasure.  As always she uses adept plotting, interesting and engaging characters, and an understated wit to examine issues and personalities.  All of her books are so much fun to read that we sometime overlook her strong ethical and moral base.  How lucky we are that she writes for us.

1594203059|1.0|As far as I can tell this book isn't much more than current wing-nut orthodoxy skillfully dressed up to appear to be good scholarly history and to appeal to the masses. It really is just awful, although  somewhat entertaining. What about the rise of protestantism and the literacy that it required?(His comments and statistics on literacy, by  the way, are ludicrous to the point of almost invalidating the book on those mistakes alone). What about the invention of the printing press? What about the rise of  liberal democracies and the emphasis on individual rights? What about the rise of secularism and the scientific method. What  about the rise of the \\"nation state\\". He tries to  subsume these things into his totally artificial  and unuseful \\"6 killer apps\\".  Property rights are important, but they are almost  completely worthless without capitalism, the other rights, and the institutions to protect  them. In fact property rights  had been one of  the few rights that was fairly well respected prior to the rise of western civilization over the last 500  years or so. Competition is also something that was only capable of serving a useful purpose in the advance of Western Civilization after the advent of other institutions, like capitalism had already taken place. He needs to  rethink this book  and start  over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Within the first few paragraphs you are attached to the characters. Wonderful! Of the three books this is the masterpiece! I won't tell you anything more. You simply must read. I did not think it was for me but when my 14 year old, male cousin who likes nothing recommends a book. I had to read it.  It was so worth it! I have even gotten both of my grandmothers to read the series.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|When everyone and their dog was buzzing about this show, I decided I needed to watch it, even though it took me a year or so.  It is about a patriarch, his second, younger wife, and her child, and his two children and their family. You know, the \\"modern family\\" with the gay couple and the adopted child from another country, the \\"typical\\" family with their own quirks, and the second marriage.<br /><br />I am also a fan of NBC's Parenthood, and I honestly find both of them quite refreshing.  I couldn't begin to compare the two, as Parenthood is more of a drama, and I had reservations after enjoying Parenthood so much, but I am so glad I decided to watch this show and found it extremely enjoyable.  Even though Modern Family doesn't take itself too seriously, real family situations are used and the situations are relatable on some level, which in ways makes it funnier.<br /><br />It is a fantastic show with fabulous writing and wonderful acting.  I used it as a pick me up after going through some personal stuff and it worked! I am not one to giggle a lot or laugh out loud a lot, but it made me giggle. I'm not surprised at its praise and I look forward to watching more in the future.  I cannot stress how great this cast is, especially the child actors. I love quirky shows, especially about families and this show is a winner!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Quite simply, Breaking Bad is one of the absolute ten (10) best film, movie, stories, etc. to date that I have been lucky to have watched and enjoyed during my lifetime so far.

B007MU85D0|5.0|I bought this album on a whim - I had not heard of the band before it came up in my suggestions. It was well worth it! There's not a song on the album that I don't like (which is rare for me, I usually pick about 4-5 songs and listen to them over and over), that doesn't speak to me in some way. I think this will be one of the best (if not THE best) albums of the year!
0385344228|3.0|This book strikes me as a combination of \\"Presumed Innocent\\" and \\"We need to talk about Kevin.\\"  Both of those books are much better written and are worthy of 5 stars.  A bit of foreshadowing helps add to the suspense, but , in my head, I knew early on how this book was going to end.  It's supposed to be some kind of shock/twist, but if you pay only a little bit of attention, you will know what is coming. You  will know how Jacob's trial ends, also.  That was certainly no big surprise.<br /><br />None of the supporting characters seem terribly believable.  SOme of them are highly crucial to the plot, and I spent a lot of time thinking to myself...that makes no sense... why would this person act that way or say those things?<br /><br />So if you like your mystery/suspense/court-room thrillers spoon fed to you, go ahead and read this book.  If you prefer some depth, good character development, and originality, skip it.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I took the time to read almost all the reviews some of them with certainly a feeling of shock and surprise. While I understand why people will like to have more \\"just George after the Beatles\\" footage I also understand that even though Beatles always try to under play being a \\"Beatle\\" that was most likely the most important thing that happened in their lives. George is not a stranger to that feeling. It is true that all of that has been well documented before but that happened and was paramount in his life and also in the others Beatles lives. I enjoyed a lot the part that shows his other interests such as car racing, movies (Life of Brian an episode that I did not know), and his relationship with other great musicians such as Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne, etc. That was a nice addition.<br />In my opinion the documental was candid and very well presented the facts.  They did not try to portrait him like a saint. It was kind of hard to hear his own wife talking about his weakness for ladies something that others have reported but not in such a personal way like Olivia Harrison did. I think they did a great job in that part.<br />I enjoyed the documental and I recommend it to George's or Beatles fans. If you are not a Beatle fan I am afraid that you could get a little bit bored I wasn't. Still it is a nice historical perspective. The music we have today definitively had its rots and influences in the music from that time.<br />George Harrison always has been my favorite Beatle because while the others wrote, sang and played songs about peace/love George Actually took action in the Bangladesh concert to help people tormented by natural disasters and give them some relief and hope. In that regard he was a pioneer as well it was the first time that an artist got together with a plethora of stars for a good cause. If you notice Paul was not there and I read somewhere that John wanted that Yoko was in the stage after Harrison's refusal Lennon opted out.....None of that was also included in the part that talks about the Bangladesh concert.<br />The fact that he has such close relationship with Eric Clapton drove me back to the times of the great impressionist painters that know each other such as Degas, Cezanne, Monet, Manet, or Paul Gauguin friendship with Vincent Van Gogh. History usually sends us those geniuses in groups....<br />Harrison definitively was the more \\"spiritual\\" of the four the fact that he needed to cope with some frustrations and sometimes shows  a kind of erratic behavior with great swings between vicious words and gentle actions puts him in a level that the rest of us can understand, relate and identify and of course love/admire him even more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. only 1 issue. cant visit neighbors without having to try 10 times. hope this gets fixed soon!!!
0553801473|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but so far it is quite absorbing and brilliantly written. Amazing New characters appear like Price Aegon, and old ones remain, such as my belobed Tyron Lannister.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|the only bad thing is that if you have to reistall it for any reason you have. to start from scratch.  frustrating. Pps add loving to solve that problem. Thanks.
B007SGM084|5.0|The triology is amazing! I found myself engulfed in these books & couldn't put them down. I looked forward to a break or to get home from work just to read. Very erotic & seductive! I finished all three in just two weeks. It makes me wish I hadn't read so fast! Lol
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Similar to tetris except with the possibility of potential breakage. This is probably the only app I actually re-play over and over again. Got it when it was the Free App Of The Day, but if you like addicting puzzle games, I'd suggest purchasing Bag It!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that I can view several different bible versions for free with this app. I also like the ability to download some versions for offline reading. I only wish notes could be entered off line - and then synced to my account when I'm on line again. The ability to see public notes from other app users is very nice - it's nice to know what others think about the verses/sections I'm reading.
B000002KHB|5.0|This cd is a great addition to my 70's classic rock library.  It is timeless and incomparable.  Who can ever forget \\"Smoke on the Water\\", and the opening riff that every garage guitar player, from the 70's on, tried to immitate :-)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There was no battle cry of \\"Avengers Assemble\\" in this movie. That was the only item wrong with this movie.  It was great! It was worth the wait and better than any other Marvel movie.  Too slow for the first thirty minutes?  No Way! This movie grapped you from the minute it started to the every end. You can read about the story plot from the other reviews but take it from someone who rarely goes to the movies, I am not sorry that I went. The last movie I went to was Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. So I usually wait for the DVD but not this time. I love this movie so much I have seen it twice already and working on the third time. I would recommend you see it in 3D.  Did both regular and 3D. This movie should been seen in 3D or better.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, my mind turns two ways: The first half is guns, gunpowder, and gymnastics. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) contend with the salvation of civilization mostly through athletics, aided by director Guy Ritchie's considerable skill with the camera and graphics.But in the second half, when the duo moves swiftly but intellectually to confront the arch villain Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), my mind is at equilibrium, renewing my love of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original brainy, eccentric sleuth. The chess game is a marvel of strategy, replete with revenge, intrigue, and just plain ingenuity. Director Guy Ritchie's visuals include delightful Downey disguises and lively speed ramping in a forest bombarded by bullets. Hans Zimmer's music leans heavily on the fiddle to lighten the load of a difficult plot.Watson's marriage, rather than taking away from the bromance, adds unexpected color and creativity. So Ritchie has ramped up the intellectual content and at least balanced it with the athletic, which was a strength of his 2009 version, Sherlock Holmes. With Inspector Lastrade just a memory and Holmes's love, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), appearing briefly, we are left to enjoy not so much the interaction of Holmes and Watson but the explosiveness of Holmes and Moriarty.After a first half of explosions, the second half satisfies traditionalists like me for the chess game of life and death--and that's the suspenseful fate of the world in those pieces. Director Guy Ritchie has improved on his 2009 version.
0470876417|4.0|Easy to read. I thought this book was worth the money. I thought there was a lot of good information.I would recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I should have read more reviews to find out the age group of the subjects. And I should have heeded my inner closet subconscience, -time-is-precious, working girl, when I found that this book was supposedly written for those who enjoyed Twilight but wanted more. (I read all of the Twilight books --my daughter gave them to me with the thought I would enjoy them-- but I found the story was written with considerable shallowness, and I could not feel any interest in the characters. It was a torturous read going through the last 3 books.) I have the same feelings for the characters and the writing in \\"50 Shades of Grey.\\" The female was just finishing college, and although she had everything going for her, e.g., brains, independent thought, beauty, just one female friend?, seemed to come from a nice family, and could hold down a job, yet she had no self esteem, no other girlfriends?, drank a lot and had difficulty with her appetite. I was hoping for a sexy storyline written for a slightly older person in mind, with believable characters. I got very tired of Mr. Grey running his hands through his hair. In fact there were many repetitious annoyances that seemed like space fillers, e.g. biting her lower lip, Oh My!, Oh Crap!, rolling the eyes back. I did enjoy most of the email interactions. One even made me laugh. In my college years I enjoyed the Story of \\"O\\" and I enjoyed a good bodice ripper, but I think this book is just for light fast summer reading if you have time to waste. I won't be reading the follow up books and I doubt I'll watch the film version, especially if they use that female lead from the Twilight movie.
145162445X|5.0|readable, understandable, grasping, witty, touches latest in physics and cosmology, and more importantly, its science and the truth... just read the foreword from Richard Dawkins.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|This is the best movie made with  Bill Murray in the role of Phil the weatherman. Each day repeating itself until.... something to look forward to when that would happen to you? Knowing each and everyone in a town , becoming a better man instead of the prick he was when doing his routine weatherman job. Anyway, this movie has to be in your collection. Highly enjoyable!

0547569653|4.0|Scott Jurek is an ultramarathon legend.  His accomplishments are simply amazing. \\"Eat & Run\\" will encourage and inspire you whether you are a casual runner or someone that enjoys covering long distances.  As the title states, \\"Eat & Run\\" is about Jurek's eating habits just as much as it is about his running accomplishments.  In fact, he attributes his running success to his decision to gradually change over to a plant based diet.  Even though Jurek shares his convictions regarding his lifestyle, he doesn't become overly \\"preachy.\\"  This allowed me to seriously think about my current dietary beliefs and contemplate how a plant based diet may help in my training.  It's nice that Jurek finishes every chapter with an appetizing recipe that tempted me to try some of these dishes. Although, I'm not ready to give up meat I am certainly going to try some of the recipes in the book. As someone that is contemplating running a 50K, this book was inspiring and educational.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome is well acted. Robert Duvall in the best role of his career. When you think that you have had enough they give you more until you wish that it wouldn't end. A Classic in every sense of the word.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is a great band. Great sound, more lively than a lot of the new 'folk' stuff. Think Rilo Kiley meets Mumford and Sons. You will not be disappointed. Best 5 bucks spent.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Countless philosophers and religions have tried to answer that by actually giving us a set of commandments, rules or viewpoints to actually give meaning to something we simply do not have a straight answer for. In the end, the meaning of life is the meaning we ourselves give to it.<br />The Grey is all about this, had the writer director for this move have been a fan of normal Hollywood movies with a lollipops for everybody and a happy endings this probably would never have made, and that would have been such a shame.<br />The basic premise of the movie is pretty simple; a plane crashes in the middle of Alaska and a group of survivors try to make their way into civilization while being hunted by the local wolves.  I could talk about the magnificent photography, the brilliant casting of Liam Neason or the stark beauty of the Alaskan landscape, but instead I will focus on what becomes the central point of this movie; when everything seems to be against you, what is it that truly matters to us, what makes us tick and in the end when everything seems to be done, what comfort do we get out of it?<br />The answer is as varied as the characters of the movie itself, and in a sense some have that quite moment of reflection take away from them by the circumstances, and some others simply have the moment come upon then after everything else seems to be exhausted.<br />Rarely have I watched a movie and felt this weight upon me, because we might dodge the issue and try to justify the way we have lived and the things we have done, but it is with movies like these that we feel a creeping feeling that we might have take our time for granted or numbed ourselves in our petty little lives surrounded by our petty little machines and toys...but in the end we face the reality of the meaning of our lives...and we might find it lacking, or surprisingly fulfilling ...<br />Do not watch this movie looking to pass a few fun hours, try to see is for what it is, a masterpiece of modern cinema that dares to make us come face to face with our deepest demons and the way we deal with them in our everyday lives....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Obviously a lot of people have read this book and I've figured out that you either love it or hate it.  It's very risque so if you don't like those kind of books and like to stick to PG romance then don't read this book.  If you are open and like things that push the boundaries then you will love this book, the whole trilogy in fact.
0061438294|5.0|I was excited about reading this book before I bought it.<br />After reading reading it I felt completely that my beleifs were justified.<br />A great read particularly if deception detection and the like is something of interest to you.<br />So good I've bought his follow up book.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This is Stephen King at his finest. It is a gripping read that mixes history with fiction to bring a briliant read.  He works the characters so well that you can feel their pain and be anxious when they are in danger.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Stephen King the way he used to be.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|I have not read the books but from what I have seen on the show I want to read them! Season one was amazing! I could not get enough! When it was over I was pretty sad. There were some things that I did not expect but overall, this show is amazing and I love so many characters, you should give it a shot.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|Movies is quite funny & nieces & nephews loved it.  Ages 4-12...the bad reviews if anyone notices were written all about the same date.  Everyone just decides to write Feb. 2????  not likely.  Don't let bad reviews misguide you this isn't the first movie to receive so many bad reviews.  Be suspicious of high number of bad reviews some have something against certain products or movies.  Just watch the happy feet previews.
B007J7LFTW|4.0|Ian Anderson's \\"TAAB-2\\"...don't know why this isn't Jethro Tull \\"TAAB-2\\". At first, I found this album merely okay; but, with each repeated listen, I can honestly say, it is growing on me.  I like it!!  Ian's voice is terrific.  There is plenty of energy in each track.  The songs are outstanding!  What's not to like, if you're a real Tull fan?  Well, there are the 3 or 4 sections where, for some unknown reason, Ian decides to talk his way thru a portion of the song.  THAT stuff I don't like!  Thank God in this day and age we have itunes (or any number of other mp3 editors) and can easily (and cleanly) edit out the completely worthless spoken bits.  Other than Flying Colors (the Steve Morse band album), this is the best album so far of 2012.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|At first I was reluctant to see this adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, as I'd read many accounts stating that it did not live up to its Swedish predecessor (which I've never seen). Having preferred the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice over the recent film adaptation (starring Keira Knightley), I sympathize with those loyal to the Swedish version of Dragon, since oftentimes one favors whatever adaptation one has seen first. However, I greatly enjoyed David Fincher's version. As is usually the case in his films, the pacing was excellent, and of course the visuals were gorgeous, even in their grittiness. The film nicely summed up a lot of plot points which I felt dragged on needlessly in the book, and basically cut out a lot of the dead weight. I actually prefer the film over the book, which is a rarity for me. But what really won me over was Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth. She was the Lisbeth I'd envisioned when I read the book. While I can understand other viewers' loyalty to the Swedish version (particularly Swedes!), I personally found Fincher's version to be brilliant in its own right. Perhaps I'll watch the Swedish version too, just for the fun of comparison.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie is amazing, the songs and costumes are great. I have not seen this on broadway but I will soon hopefully. They never come to the state I live in so I am going to go out of state to see it. I love Emmy Rossum's voice, it is beautiful and I cannot get enough of it. I had to buy the CD and they did a awesome job on the Phantoms face.
B00005B36H|4.0|The product came in as described by the sellar. However it was packaged poorly. it only had a plastic shopping bag similar to a walmart bag placed over the CD and then wrapped in what looked like tissue paper.That was the outer wrap with the address labels attached. One could feel the cd through the wrapper. I guess i was lucky to get it in one piece and nothing broken. Excellant CD and a fair price for a new CD.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome hope u have fun on it ohhh ya it is daa bomb please enjoy it i did
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I would say that the game is worth the file space! It's a nintendesque fame that is very pretty and easy to get the hang of.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True blood is an amazing one of a kind show! It always goes places that you do not expect and it is awesome!<br />The only thing I do not like is that everyone is into Sookie, I know that is the whole premise of the show, but it gets old after sooo much.<br />I love Eric and Lafayette!
1423113381|5.0|I was just finishing the Percy Jackson series when I learned of kane series so I thought I would try it and so far I am enjoying it as much as I did the Percy series. Thank-you to the seller for the quick shipping and great service.

B0038NN3B4|5.0|concise and accessible wisdom from an expert in the field with decades of experience. Easy to read and lots of great practical information.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I love this show! It always catches my attention! At first I was not too sure if I would like it. They have good story lines but there are some things that do bother me.. One would be that the whole world revolves around Elena, which I feel like with the two brothers liking her it is very similar to True Blood with Sookie, Bill and Eric. Also that gets very repetitive ALL ABOUT ELENA! There are quite a few vampire shows out right now, but I am a fan of this one! :]
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I am grateful to Philip Roth and to Leonard Cohen for so intelligently exploring the phases of physical love and physical decay.  Naturally, some are more fun than others.  But, if we manage to live long enough, we will all face these inevitable developments.  I'm not much younger than either of these gentlemen, so I can really relate.  I hope their words are as welcome to those more youthful.
0307592731|1.0|I don't want someone else to get burned like I did.  This book was terrible.  The author attempts to use a flowery, extended vocabulary to tell a story about how she selfishly made terrible choices and continues to selfishly make terrible choices.  She is the cause of her own train wreck of a life and I hope to save you from having to listen to her whine on and on about it only to do nothing to fix it.  After hundreds of pages of whining she magically says she's changed, but she's exactly the same as when she started.  The book should have been called \\"Wallow: in self pity you'll never actually address while hiking 1,100 miles.\\"
1934030597|5.0|This book was excellent! The author seems to have a lot of knowledge and a little humor goes a long way. I have two bikes a hardtail that's pretty old school and a current full suspension which the book cover in depth. Love it and I did recommend it to all my friends.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|I never heard of this group until their hit single. This is an excellent album that doesn't really fit any particular genre. Some techno, some pop.  Can't really describe it any other way.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was a great instant download from Amazon.  There are 9 episodes to watch, and the downloaded quality of the Masterpiece shows was excellent. I felt that the instant download was well worth the money.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|If you're looking at this book, you have either finished the first 4, or you are currently watching the HBO series and wanted to know what happens next.<br /><br />For the first type of people: Yes it's not as exciting as the first 3 installations, but there are still some interesting plot lines that will make you to look forward to his/her next PoV chapter. I mean why stop in a middle of an awesome journey just because things slowed down a little? An incomplete journey isn't a journey at all.<br /><br />For the second type of people: Nothing in this book is going to make much sense to you, so I wouldn't recommend you jump this fast ahead. Stick to the HBO version, you'll be less confused and more happy about the current status of ongoing events as is.<br /><br />What I really didn't liked about the book was even though I know a huge portion of the story will be in parallel with AFfC, most of the events happening just wasn't interesting enough to keep me, the reader, hooked and wanting for more. Yes we want to know what happened to the characters that wasn't mentioned in AFfC, but we don't want to know if the weather's nice, what they ate for dinner, and how many games of cyvasse they played.<br /><br />What I really liked was... well I can't tell you that since that'll be spoiling the fun for you. ;)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is very addicting. it had great graphics and I have have had a hard time putting it down.
0812550757|5.0|It had been awhile since I last read Ender's Game, and all I remembered from that was that it had been extremely fun to read. After that, I read many different books from many different genres (except for romance novels... those are way too unoriginal for my tastes). Then, I had the chance to read Speaker for the Dead...<br />Hands down my favorite book of all time.<br />Before I begin, I would like to say, \\"No, you do not have to read Ender's Game to understand what's going on. Everything is explained at some point in the story... but read Ender's Game anyway.\\"<br />Orson's understanding of human emotions and his portrayal of this older Ender, along with his creativity, astounded me. From the super computer program that only Ender knows to the Little Ones themselves, the Speaker for the Dead will keep you hooked, simply because you'll want to know how simple actions by the characters towards things they know little of lead to drastic results, and you'll want your many questions answered. Orson is one of the few authors that are able to answer everything that's needed, and not have the reader say, \\"But you never explained this...\\"<br />Get it. Read it. Tell me all about it.<br />Or not.<br />But definitely buy it... and Ender's game... and the other six books in this series...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is easy to play and it gets intense fast. Pretty sweet game. I would definitely recommend this game.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I play this game everyday but about 2 weeks ago it started that everything but new additions don't work as they are supposed to. I click on them &amp; it says they are ready but they just don't work.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|OMG!  I can't put this book down:  I love the intriguing plots unravelling separately with each character's chapter, yet so intricately intwined!  Well written, exciting and fast-moving: I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
0761169253|5.0|What a cool book. A fast and fun read that's entertaining and informative. I love Austin Kleon's style and his art.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This is a great read something away from the traditional genre of crime, thriller or romance. It is surprisingly engaging and holds your attention from the opening chapter to the final page. I couldnt wait to read more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Reviews are a tricky thing and you should always remember that they are only an opinion. I nearly didn't buy this book because I was reading the reviews and almost let myself be talked out of the purchase. In the end I couldn't ignore the huge amount of press that this book has received and I decided to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />After spending the last 24 hours unable to put this book down, I decided to give my own opinion on it.<br /><br />This book is not literary genius. If that is what you are looking for, take your snobbery on over to the classics section of Amazon and buy something by Shakespeare or Jane Austin. If, like me, you enjoy books such as the Twilight Series, then BUY THIS BOOK. Yes, the characters are incredibly gorgeous. The lead Christian is impossibly handsome, rich beyond belief and generously endowed. This is FICTION. I am more than happy to suspend reality and believe what I'm reading, while I'm reading it. That's what is so enjoyable about reading FICTION. The girl is inexperienced, shy and submissive. Fabulous, if you ask me. The imagination used in the development of these characters makes it an incredibly sexy read.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Gray is 1000 shades of hot. No, it won't blow you away with its alliterations and prose. It will give you a titillating ride through the world of two very sexy fictional characters. I know that I am glad I bought the book and ignored all those who said it wasn't worth the read.<br /><br />Now I'm off to go buy the next book in the series!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the AccuWeather App. It is easy to use accurate &amp; easy to customize.  We had severe weather last night including a tornado sighting but the AccuWeather was able to help keep us safe with the customization of the weather &amp; weather videos.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I read a comment written by my friend I had to see what this book was all about.  I started to read and it started out kind of slow but the moment Grey started to pursue Ana that is when it got very hard to put this book down.
030758836X|5.0|I have read Gillian Flynn's other two novels and each was amazing in its own way--gripping plot, memorable characters, and clean, tight prose that complements the flow of the story. But with GONE GIRL, she outdoes herself, building a mystery/thriller/dark meditation on love and marriage that was so involving I read all 400+ pages over the course of one weekend. This is the kind of book for which you turn off the phones, block out some time, plan on staying up late because you are simply not going to want to put this book down. Highly, highly recommended!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is a movie I needed to see a couple of times to appreciate.  It was delivered quickly and undamaged and I am very pleased.

031618201X|5.0|I read a lot of supernatural manga, which is what drew me to Gail Carriger's Soulless. This manga lived up to my expectation of a supernatural manga.  It is a great blend of supernatural, Victorian England, and manga sensibilities.<br /><br />The supernatural being, werewolves and vampires, are portrayed as the noble men and women I would expect in Victorian England. Their codes they abide by are a marvelous insight into their world.<br /><br />The zany development of Alexia Tarabotti and Lord Conall Maccon's relationship is a delight. Their awkwardness of their interactions is hilarious.<br /><br />I highly recommend this manga for those who love the supernatural & romantic comedies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|How in the world can I say anything that hasn't been said a million times.<br />getting the books wasma plus because I could share them.
B0023RSZZU|5.0|Markus Zusak is a great author.  \\"The Book Thief\\" is the fourth of his books that I have read, and each one of them was compelling reading in its own way.  \\"The Book Thief\\" is his most ambitious undertaking of the four, and it is a fascinating read.  His books may be targeted at young adult readers, but I am in my 60s, and it has been great for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like everything about this app. It makes reading the Bible easier with reading plans, crossreferencing, notes, highlighting, etc. It is also interesting to see what others have to say about various verses. Works great on kindle fire.
B007GATVYI|2.0|The comic itself is ok but for me living in Europe it was really disappointting to realize that I bought a eComic instead of the real book that I was interested in (which they won't sell as a digital copy to Europe - go figure!).
B007V2UGPE|2.0|Fun game but after putting numerous hours playing, it froze up and tapping start game is fruitless. Thus ending my interest.
B003UVZ23G|5.0|Markus Zusak is a great author, who is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites.  My other favorite authors are Herman Hesse, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Charles Dickens - each one portrays the human condition eloquently with words that reach deep inside.  Zusak delivers messages about the innate goodness of humans in very unlikely settings - the same message my Dad gave me years and years ago.  \\"I Am the Messenger\\" was the first of his books that I read, and I have now added three others of his to the list.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I was initially skeptical about this case, for two reasons. First I'm very fond of the Kindle case I currently use. While it doesn't double as a stand, I like it's look.<br /><br />Second, I'm always skeptical of things which should be simple but include instructions (in both French and English). Not only did it have multi-lingual instructions, a website was also listed where I could see videos. Having had BAD experiences with screen covers for my iPod, I wasn't encouraged.<br /><br />But the Kindle Fire installed easily, just clicking simply into place using the polycarbonite tabs.  I can easily reach both the power switch and the mini-USB, so using my Fire is very easy.<br /><br />The textured leather on the cover has an elegant look and I like the elastic strap on the back, you can easily pull around to keep the case shut.<br /><br />But where it really shines is as a stand to use your FIRE in the horizontal position (not vertically). The interior on the left has a non-stick surface that looks like textured leather. It allows you to place the FIRE in any position. I found this made it very easy to sit and read.<br /><br />I haven't tried it yet, but it looks as if other Kindles may fit so they can use the Vibe as a case. But since they can only be used vertically, the stand will not function here.<br /><br />A great product.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say, I didn't want to purchase this book, due to its price, but I just couldn't resist the hoopla around it and broke down on a Friday evening.  I have to say, the book is addicting to read and fairly easy to follow, I finished it over the weekend.  I have to agree with many on here, the book has quite a bit of repetitiveness in it, but I got over it quickly as the book moved along quickly.  I think overkill sometimes, but I let it slide because I am simply fascinated by Christian Grey's character.  He is your typical gorgeous looking, uber rich, ideal romance book hero, but yet so messed up in the head.  I was intrigued by his actions, his mood swings, his issues, his attitude and wanted to see what made him tick, or why he was the way he was.  His character was fascinating to me: his protectiveness, his desire to control, his stalker tendencies (creepy & romantic at the same time)! :)<br /><br />As far as Ana goes, her character was not bland, she was simply young.  I had to keep in mind that she was young and fresh out of college, so I tried to put myself at that stage, remembering how inexperienced and naive I was at some point.  Ana is still trying to define herlself and who she was.  Christian is her first relationship and the first man she is attracted to and falls for.  We all remember that one person we loved so much, we would do anything for them if they asked.<br /><br />I thought the love story was good, so passionate, so strange and yet so exciting.  The sex was steamy, and ok, after the 50th orgasm I stopped counting, but we all know its fiction anyways!  Will the book win awards for writting and editing? Probably not, but it worked for me.  Characters were intriguing and I found myself turning the pages.  I will probably read the rest of the books so I can find out what happens at the end.  If the books were a bit cheaper, it would have been deserving of 5 stars, but for ten dollars, it falls short, therefore earning 4 stars from me.
B006C1DH92|4.0|This was a pretty good game. Although, you can definitely tell there was a difference in the speed of the fruits falling. I unlocked everything in about a total of an hour. It's a good game if you're not that great at the original Fruit Ninja.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Got my Fire when they first came out and chose not to get a cover as they seem overpriced. Got this to try this one though and use it most of the time now. Nice to have something that adds a little proctection and gives it a little more flexibility. Just started watching a little more video on it and the cover definitely helps there. This particular cover looks nicer than some others I've seen.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon has a way of describing things that really make you feel as if it were YOU who were living the lives of the characters he creates. His narrative is compelling and attractive-don't let this author go unread in your personal library.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video about 4 years ago at Walmart.  I have used it off and on since then and am still going back to it when I feel I need to get more exercise.  I recently bought it on Amazon as a gift for my friend.  Much cheaper.  Jillian Michaels gets straight to the point.  I get a little irritated with the \\"advanced\\" work out girl.  She cheats all the time and that kind of makes me mad as I'm panting trying to get through this video.  The music isn't the gratest either but you know what, it's about the results and she definitely gets you results.  The one thing I would recommend with this video is that if you are just starting an exercise program and choose this, follow the beginner version of each level before trying to go all out.  Otherwise, guaranteed, for the first several days or workouts you will not be able to move in the days to come.  :)  Ease into it a little and you will thank me later!  :)  And if you work it every day or even 6 days as she instructs you WILL get results from this workout.  Check out some of her other videos too.  Everything, in my opinion, from her is worth it!
1612680011|1.0|I've never been motivated to write an Amazon review until now, but I'm honestly perplexed by how many 5-star reviews this book is getting.<br /><br />On the positive side, it is motivational.  I can see where someone could read this and feel inspired to go out and start a business, invest in an opportunity, etc.  The author is basically preaching to people to get up and take risks.<br /><br />On the negative side (and there are many negatives) this is a book without any substance.  The author simply repeats the same points throughout the entire book without giving any insight or details.  His literary technique is to praise his friend's \\"Rich Dad\\" (who is likely invented) while heaping scorn on his actual \\"Poor Dad\\" in a way which is not only insulting but disdainful to read.  His ego is constantly apparent as he brags about making millions in a day, flipping houses to double his money, but he never gives any advice or details about how to do this.  As I result I learned zero from this book.<br /><br />Worse, the advice he gives about taking risks, not settling for safe investments, getting out of real estate contracts, etc is dangerous and potentially illegal.  People with a large amount of cash around and available for investment have many better books to help them make money.  People without that luxury - whom seem to be the target audience for this author - should not even consider gambling their future in the way that is described here.<br /><br />Finally, after reading the book I googled the author and learned that there is quite a bit of controversy about this books.  He seems to have made his fortune off of book selling, not off of the investment technique he describes here, and has continually refused to give any details about his finances.  I would recommend anyone considering this book to do a quick google search yourself and decide if there may be a better book to read.  This was a waste of my time, although its repetitive, preachy nature makes it a quick, if unsatisfying, read.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|As always with Carlos Ruiz Zafon, this books leaves you wanting more: inttrugue, adventure, everything! Good book-looking forward to El Prisionero del Cielo...
B001MYIXAC|5.0|On the surface this movie appears to be another film riding the vampire popularity wave. As a fan of both international films and the horror genre, I bought this on a whim and put it aside to watch when I had nothing else to view. Last night I finally played the dvd. I was spell bound by this little gem. First, to label it a vampire movie is an injustice. The themes of friendship, bullys, and first love are far more prevalent than the bloodsucking events. \\"Good\\" and \\"evil\\" are shown to be gray areas, so you can't really say if good wins in the end. The vampire feeding episodes are graphic- no romantic bite on the neck, but yet I found myself siding with the vampire. This film points out there is bad aspects in the nicest person and good intent in the foulest creature. I admit I felt no empathy for any of the adult characters. Every adult appeared shallow compared with complexity of the young characters. I loved this movie. If it didn't have the intense feeding scenes I would recommend this to children as a lesson on bullying, friendship, and not judging people who are different. I would certainly let this film into my home.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I'm an avid Jane Eyre fan, and I was excited about watching this movie. But from the very start, I was disappointed, and disappointed that I had to be disappointed!<br /><br />Nothing seemed developed at all. Unless you knew the story before-hand, it would be very difficult to understand what was going on, and the depth behind it. The actresses's portrayal of Jane was the weakest I've seen - where's Jane's quick wit and spunk? Her evening conversations with Mr. Rochester were boiled down to 2 minutes of strained, flat pry-it-out-of-her conversation, instead of the spunky, bluntly honest conversations from the book. Her quietness was over emphasized, leaving her with NO depth, no emotion, no character. The only time you see her \\"falling in love\\" is of her twirling a flower in her hand, bringing the depth of her emotions down to that of a school-girl crush. There is actually very little interaction between her and Mr. Rochester, and the parts that are there show absolutely no chemistry. Rochester's actor was way too nice! Bronte meant him to be harsh, bitter, darkened, manipulative, haunted by demons of his past, yet able to flash the hand of kindness and emotions. All we see here is brief glimpses of a happy, smiling, contented-looking man. The line in the movie when Jane returns to Thornfield after burying her aunt, and Mr. Rochester says \\"Jane Eyre with nothing to say?\\" This line amazed me - because all throughout the movie, Jane has said VERY LITTLE, bringing this sentence (although a true statement when held up to the Jane from the book) to having no barring or connection with the story at all.<br /><br />It was impossible to engage with the depth of both of their emotions after the wedding - it made no sense for them to be in such passions of emotions over not being together, when they had barely had any time together, and definitley none that even hinted at such a soul-connection between them. I found myself repeated almost wanting to laugh, as I heard lines that sounded right in the book being used in the movie, but not making sense because of the lack of portrayal of their emotional connection. There is no \\"string attached\\" to their hearts.<br /><br />If you want a version that captures the essense of the book, even down to using most of the original dialog written by Bronte, watch the [[ASIN:B000784WMW Jane Eyre]] with Dalton & Clark. It's old and the cinematography is old classis BBC...which can take a little while to adjust to. But it's worth it, as it captures every essense of what Jane Eyre is supposed to be.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Read this book cause its  great. I enjoy reading books and this is in the top 10 or 20 ( series count as one book). Also read Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Absolutely top notch in all aspects.  Great acting and hilarious one-liners throughout make this an absolute top shelf movie.  This is one worthy of watching multiple times!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I hated running until after I read this book. All through high school and collage my knees would always kill me... until after I read this book and decided to try running barefoot... this book changed my life I went from driving to work 14 miles to running to work 14 miles. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a very good read but also to anyone looking for a reason to change their life and get out and run!!!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Once again the author brings a relatively obscure part of history to life with an interesting set of characters.  The historical research is evident throughout the novel and it provides an epic setting for the story he tells to his readers.  I didn't think this book was as good as Pillars of the Earth or World Without End but it is certainly worth a read for Follett fans.  I look forward to reading the remaining two books of the trilogy.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|Acting is excellent as the story of an aging person of note is portrayed by Streep.  If you hoped for more of Margaret Thatcher's role as Prime Minister...it is not here.

If you are<br />an acting student...it is great study of aging.  If you liked Margaret Thatcher's role on the<br />world scene...it is a major 'skip.
0345803507|1.0|Ok, I made it through the first two books and admit they are somewhat addicting... I believe it is because the reader is hoping that the storyline starts to make sense! Everything ends up playing out so anti-climactic in this book.<br /><br />The repetitive language drives me completely mad- \\"Holy cow\\", \\"Oh My\\", \\"Mr. Gray, Mrs. Gray, \\"My Wife\\", \\"Inner goddess\\"...  so annoying!<br /><br />And all of a sudden in what, a month, Anastasia manages to completely change this guy and turn him into a mush?  And she is apparently plain and wimpy?  They are mad at each other the entire book and make up over and over again... It's like the author cut and pasted parts of book and changed minor details.<br /><br />A few other details that don't make any sense.<br />1) Why the inclusion of the Ethan and Mia storyline?<br />2) Ok, both brothers end of proposing to their girlfriends in a matter of weeks?<br />3) I don't get Jack and how he just so happens to be her boss, and yes- his foster brother.  No detail here.<br />4) She keeps saying that she is uncomfortable about money, but allows him to buy her a $500 bathing suit?<br />5) Why was Gia in Aspen?<br /><br />The list can go on and on.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|for most people, this cooler might be your first cpu cooler. and you will be surprised it make temperature drop 10c. then you will claim, wow, it's great cpu cooler.<br /><br />maybe at date of 2010, 212+ is one of very few cpu cooler which works. for today's market, tons of cooler will work similarly, or better than 212+. if you want to tell a cooler good or not, you might need compare. as my personal test, corsair a50 is at least same as 212, CM n520 also works well. if you want better ones, XIGMATEK SD1283 about 30$, zalman cnps 10x about 40$, corsair a70 about 35$, works much better than 212+.<br /><br />i can not believe, LLYtech now sell 212+ at amazon at price 29.xx$, kind of aggressive, definitely super overrated.<br /><br />if you really want 212+, the only reason is price, its c/p ratio is good when price lower than 20$.

0345803485|4.0|I thought this book was very well written, all three of them, I thought the writer did a very good job with Christian, I loved how they went from a man that was living in his own world and not really having and knowing a real relationship.... and then having a relationship that he loved and lived for.... with a touch of his \\"Oh so Christain ....his fifty shades\\".<br /><br />I thought that Ana was such fun in this book, I so loved her inner Goddess, which many times left a smile on my face, I also loved her spirit of who and what she was.... and always keeping Christain on his towes, and always reminding him..... of how far he has grown in life and in there relationship.<br /><br />The only thing that was disapointing to me was, that they wrote a pregnancy so early in the Trilogy.....the two main people in the books being Ana and Christain, are so big in all aspects of there lifes..... I hope that the writer will really focuse more on that in the next book, and that  Ana continueing driving him nuts with her crazy \\"in the moments\\" things she does.... and having a pregnancy just was not somthing I thought need to be put in the Trilogy right now. Other than that is was a very good book.....<br /><br />I am very excited to read the next book though, I just wish.... and one can only hope she will focuse more on them and there life, relationship,and all the crazy stuff that goes between them.

Experiences like reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks goes a ling way to dispel such bias.

B001CDWFPC|4.0|This is the first book that I purchased when I bought my Kindle 3 (now Kindle Keyboard). Allow me to comment on two aspects:<br /><br />1. KINDLE FORMAT. The good or bad review regarding the format should first and foremost come from the navigation aspect. Nevertheless, it depends on your approach towards navigating a Bible. If you use the traditional, skim through way, then there will be no problem. However, if you are in the group of 'jump to a verse' person, then the problem comes. The Index provided with every Kindle devices (not the app) is helpful, but only just. Personally, I always say to myself that I'm navigating the Bible 'in a traditional, somewhat faithful to traditional book' way by skimming through (i.e. next page-previous page) and taking favor from the provided Index, rather than forcing myself to think this is an electronic Bible (which proves to be underwhelming).<br /><br />2. CONTENT. Some of the more careful readers will surely find out that this Bible has a strong association with the theology of a particular church. As a considerable layman, I consider the theological contents as okay, and rich. Rich, in the sense that it provides numerous articles and supporting documents regarding the Bible and Christian (read: Protestant) faith. It also provides, in a considerable portion, issues of Christianity with other religions. Nevertheless, I won't be surprised if there are readers that have concerns with the theological approach. It is hard to please everyone in this kind of publication, for certain. Translation-wise, I consider the ESV to be one of the best English translation available (my mother tongue is not English); especially compared to some other popular English translations. It is a good balance between literary language and common understanding; inasmuch that I find little difficulties in understanding the message, even in times when I merely skim through the passages.<br /><br />To conclude, the ESV Study Bible (Kindle Edition) is a very good addition to your Kindle library. In particular, just be careful with your expectation in terms of the formatting, since it does not please anyone, but in reality good enough to be moderately easy to use.y good addition to your Kindle library.

B004P8JPS6|3.0|I am a fan of the Jack Reacher series, but I'm afraid i am unable to claim the same for this entry.  It appears that Lee Child is running out of ideas and, as a result, has traveled back in time to present us with a prequel, an attempt to explain how Reacher became the man he is in later books.<br /><br />the problem with any prequel, however, is that it is, by definition, devoid of suspense.  We know so much about the character that we know he cannot be in mortal danger.  We know he cannot do time in a Federal or military prison.  We already know that Reacher is a stone killer, so there is no shock when he cold-bloodedly murders civilian and soldier alike.<br /><br />The characters are fairly non-existent.  The small town in which this story takes place is peopled with finger puppets.  The only real \\"person\\" (defined here as a character with whom Reacher has actual conversations, not just fonts of plot material, is the same woman that appears in every Reacher novel - the tough local cop who immediately trusts Reacher and falls into bed with him without reserve.<br /><br />To take it a step further, however, it seems that \\"Child\\" (for I no longer believe he wrote this book - it just doesn't have the right feeling) no longer cares about pretending to respect our intelligence.  The plot of this book, about a murder in a small town and its ensuing coverup, reaches way too far for connections and demands the reader suspend his disbelief on scant spiderwebs of faith.<br /><br />The penultimate climax, which occurs in an office in the Pentagon, is so ridiculous a child would scoff his incredulity.  I was pained, angry, and insulted that the author had written these words, that his editor and publisher had okayed them and, finally, disappointed that I had shelled out hard-earned cash to purchase them.  The finale, after the explosive stupidity of the Pentagon scenes, was just an average letdown, barely earning its own groan.<br /><br />Since I downloaded this book to my Kindle app, I was not able to express true anger and disgust by tearing the pages in half and flinging them across the room, so I will have to let this review act as my proxy.  It's much less satisfying, but it may prevent you from making the same mistake.ndle app, I was not able to express true anger and disgust by tearing the pages in half and flinging them across the room, so I will have to let this review act as my proxy.

B007ZRZF8I|5.0|When I first got my kindle fire I looked for this game to find that the store didn't have it yet. I was enraged! But now that its here I should just review the awsomeness that is, Gravity Guy. If you have never played it, it's only control is tapping. The graphics are wonderful, they are just stunning. The pictures don't show their amazingness. The price is worth it. You get multiplayer+2 story modes+cool credits and endless mode. It has a high replayability too. Extremely easy puzzles at the beginning, but they get expert hard later on in the game. Buy the game, and be ready for a challenge!

B006ZCWTG0|5.0|This is a great album from these guys.<br /><br />My humble opinion is that it's more listenable than Obzen, meaning it seems less technically insane. That may be unfair, but there have been moments when listening to this incredibly progressive band that my head feels like it's about to implode. This album runs straight through, for me, without that crushing feeling. And, surprisingly, I really really enjoy that.<br /><br />It's still brutal and more fluent than some other albums. The DVD extra (on the spec edition) was terrific as well. Great insight into the band recording and writing.<br /><br />Standout tracks for me are \\"The Demon's Name is Surveillance\\" (brutal drumming and right hand work) and \\"Break Those Bones...\\" (incredible groove!) I also love the last mellow track.<br /><br />If you like Meshuggah, you probably already have this. If you don't, this is a brilliant way in to the band (I'd recommend going backwards from here, to Obzen next).<br /><br />It's always too long between their albums. Glad the wait is over.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These trilogies of books are a set of adventure, suspense, drama, and surprises.  I couldn't put the last book down and stayed up all night to complete this fantastic story.  I recommend reading the trilogy before attending the movie that has been made and the follow on movies.  Unspoken drama contained in the books and not mentioned in the movies will lend better understanding of the storyline.  One Hundred Stars for the author \\"Suzanne Collins\\".
0446547603|5.0|This book stands out in many ways. First of all it is not the typical love story that every writer seems to write about these days. It involves a deep storyline that touches your heart and is relatable yet dramatic. It's something that many people go through, and sheds light on an important issue... even though it is a fiction novel. Second it is one of those novels that you read the back and are hooked instantly. It has not only understandable, descriptive writing but also Sparks' amazing style of writing (which is a plus). Lastly, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ending is definitely unexpected also. This book is one of those books that once you start reading, you can't put it down. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a romantic drama.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|The best way i can think to describe this would be to compare the first Ghost Rider and this one to Punisher(Tom Jane) and Punisher War Zone. The first Ghost Rider and the Punisher both had a wider appeal but didn't feel like the comics to me. On the other hand, I thought that Ghost Rider 2 and Warzone were both darker, grittier and more exciting as well as a little more like the comics that they are based on. Its definitely not for everybody but i do think that if you are a fan of ghost rider its at least worth watching. I went into it thinking i wouldn't like it based on all of the bad reviews but i thought it was well worth going to see.

B004EPZ08E|3.0|Loved the movie, felt that it absolutely was hilarious and enjoyed the antics of everyone involved.  Watched and listened to characters that resemble people from my own past that deserved what they got. On the other hand HATED WB version of a digital copy. Spent an hour trying to sign up for and log into two services and applications that I really don't want on my computer nor my iphone etc....and still cannot transfer to any digital devices OTHER that an application on my computer.....which again didnt want to add. Highly recommend the movie HIGHLY recommend NOT buying the digital version copy for the extra money as it's a waste.
0345803485|1.0|The most boring trilogy EVER!  Almost invisible plotline.  I generally read mystery or true crime, but went out on a limb and purchased the first book because Entertainment Weekly raved about it.  Ana Steele is the most boring, spineless creature in literature.  The writing is repetitive, the storyline ridiculous.  The best thing about this book is the spoof Saturday Night Live did last weekend.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|Normally I like to give only good ratings (to good movies). This movie however, is so dreadful that I feel compelled to warn others of it. Void of the director Bryan Singer, (director of the first two X-Men) This movie ranks at the bottom of the barrel of the Marvel Super Hero movies. First of all, you don't just start killing off X-Men, especially Professor X ( or is he really dead?) And if he is not dead, why kill him off in the first place? They did a horrible job portraying Jean Grey as Dark Phoenix. Nothing at all like the comic book. It did not come close to doing her character justice. Even though I enjoy the villain Magneto, why is it that he has to appear as the main villain in every single X-Men movie? There are plenty of other great villains to go around. One of the very best X-Men stories and X-Men villains was The Juggernaut. If new director Brett Ratner had done this right, The Juggernaut as the main villain could have been the best X-Men movie ever. Instead, Ratner decides to portray The Juggernaut as a 3rd class villain, basically a campy goof as if he were appearing as a henchman in The original Batman TV series from the mid 1960's. What a shame and what a waste. Because of this, it is highly unlikely that The Juggernaut will ever be taken seriously going forward. The only good thing about this movie is the evolution of Storms hair. But even her stunning looks are not enough to breath life into this extremely dissappointing third installment. In the meantime, we can only pray for the return of Bryan Singer.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I've been a Jason Mraz fan for exactly 10 years now, after being introduced to his music by a friend way back in 2002.<br /><br />Since his dazzling debut with Waiting For My Rocket To Come, he has gained momentum with each new release, culminating in this outstanding collection of what I consider some of the greatest songs ever written.<br /><br />Many of my favourite artists have faltered on and off ( Michael Buble, Josh Groban, even John Mayer ), but Love Is A Four Letter Word is brilliant from beginning to end.<br /><br />Fans will no doubt be pleased with radio- and singalong-friendly tunes such as The Freedom Song, The World As I See It and Living In The Moment. Wonderful songs all, but I've always been partial to his less well-known fare - e.g. Absolutely Zero and On Love, In Sadness ( Waiting For My Rocket To Come ), Bella Luna and O. Lover ( Mr. A-Z ), Love For A Child and A Beautiful Mess ( We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things ), not to mention other classics from his spectacular 'live' concert recordings.<br /><br />For Love, it took me 10 or more spins to pick favourites, and they are ( so far at least ) The Woman I Love and Who's Thinking About You Now? Every single track is terrific, but I find these two songs exceptionally beautiful, from the simple yet gorgeous melodies to the poignant lyrics and exquisite musical arrangements.<br /><br />However, it is Jason's incomparable musicality which always brings out the best in everything he writes and performs. While earlier albums leaned towards the playful pop-rock vibe, he switched to a more introspective style with We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things, and now takes it a notch higher with Love.<br /><br />Perhaps it's a sign of his continuing maturity, or a recent broken engagement. Whatever the reason, the result is absolutely breath-taking, and I can't wait to hear him sing them at his upcoming concert in Singapore come June.<br /><br />It is indeed a great privilege to have accompanied him on his journeythese past 10 years, to see him win Grammys and be inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame, and share his joy and positive energy at his legendary concerts ( 3 and counting! ).<br /><br />Jason, I hope you'll write for a Broadway musical someday soon. Don't let the Tonys elude you. :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is wonderful... it is easy to navigate and gives the ability to highlight text and use bookmarks as well as having reading plans. It also has a number of different versions. I love it!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We had a smaller version of this which was fun, but the slide was very small, so my two year old couldn't actually slide. This play center is much larger and the slide is almost too tall for her to climb (she is only 34 inches and 23 pounds though). It looks just like it is pictured...about 8 feet by 6 feet. The sprinklers are fun and you don't waste a lot of water. If you want to use the pools, I would recommend filling them up before plugging the hose into the sprinklers, or it will take forever to fill. The slide is good size and my daughter ran around and around screaming, \\"Excite!\\" before climbing up and sliding down again. Great purchase!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those books that makes me want to play hooky from work and just read all day. It upsets me when life gets in the way of my reading when I discover an author like this.<br />I'd like to have some more, Hugh! And then some more.<br />And yes, this needs to be a mini-series.
0802798225|5.0|I am in my late 20's and I definitly enjoyed this book very much! I loved the characters and could relate to them easily. The writing style, and the intensity of the story were also top notch! It sucked me in immediatly and I couldn't put it down! This is the type of book that I'm always searching for, the kind that you don't want to stop reading even for a little while to eat or even sleep because you have to find out what happens next. Excellent book and I am really looking forward to reading more from this author!
B001AW156U|5.0|I was pretty skeptical over the quality of the triggers when ordering. I've had them for months now and haven't regretted this purchase at all. It makes the ps3 controller triggers more along the lines of 360 controllers.
0345803507|5.0|How many times can I say Bravo. So touching and a fantastic read. Very few books leave me pissed that I'm done. Frustrating that this was the last of the series. I am crossing my fingers that E.L. James can come up with another story for Christian and Ana. Also maybe tie them into stories with Kate and Mia's. Sigh...anxiously awaiting more books from her.
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a magical story told through pictures as well as words. And I don't just mean that there are pictures added in with the story, I mean the pictures mixed in actually tell parts of the story. Say Hugo is following somebody home and there are pictures of that happening, when the words pick up again they start where the picture left off, possibly at said person's house.<br /><br />Yes, I have seen the movie and honestly, I'd rather not compare the two. The movie is fantastic all by itself and the same goes for the book. You get a little more of what Hugo is thinking and feeling with the book which I appreciated. It was interesting to hear his thoughts and hopes and dreams.<br /><br />I love that the story is part adventure, part mystery, part heart-warming, and part boy-learning-to-grow-up-without-a-family. It's amazing how Selznick weaved all those elements into one beautiful story. Well, two actually, but you'll have to read the book to know what I mean.<br /><br />The Nutshell: Despite The Invention of Hugo Cabret's enormous size, I finished it within a couple hours, so don't let that scare you. The drawings are beautiful and the story is just as lovely. I don't think one outshines the other, they both work together seamlessly to tell a magical story of a boy who gets to experience love, hope, and adventure.
0345803493|5.0|And it continues...can it continue forever please? Sigh. I'm in love with Christian Grey. E.L.James keep them coming (err no pun intended *giggle*).

B00812W9QM|5.0|Megan has made a mistake. Her mistake was giving up on her acting career too quickly and settling for the tamer rewards of advertising. Wait, check that, her mistake was really failing to be Don's Dream Girl and Perfect Doll at all times. This episode tracks the difference between what is desired and what actually is for several characters and guests including, Don, Megan, Pete, Peggy and an insurance salesman who rides the train with Pete and his wife. Pete too is mapping the difference betweeh what should be and is and starts a fair bit of trouble trying to map that territory.<br /><br />As always the writing, acting and setting are wonderful but the thing that really puts us in the late sixties is the use of the opening track of the Beatle's album Revolver after being told all episode that Sterling Cooper couldn't get the Beatles. Genius! Watch and enjoy a strong mid-season episode.
B002XHNNHU|5.0|This book provides a wonderful insight into how the world around us works, from an engineering perspctive.  It is well written, entertaining and educational.  Highly recommended to all engineers as well those who are curious about the world we live in.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|While I deeply wanted to love this movie, I instead felt mostly ambivalent about it.  Margaret Thatcher's younger self alternates with a portrait of her as dementia sets in (this is no spoiler but clear nearly from the outset of the film).<br /><br />This contrast of past and present can be effective - but not in this film. Streep musters on gamely and evokes Thatcher's character as much as possible within the limits of the script. I was frankly puzzled by how much of the film focused on Thatcher's decline and confusion rather than her most powerful moments in history. It seemed a waste.<br /><br />This isn't an absolute wreck of a film. Certain moments ring true. When Thatcher becomes prime minister  and walks through a sea of men, one feels for Thatcher. Streep conveys Thatcher's resolute nature and presence and her uncertainty about her chances of becoming prime minister. She has to be convinced this is actually possible when her stated goal is only to shake up things. .<br /><br />The movie is unfortunately quite slow and feels like a dull documentary instead of the riveting historical account it could have been. As my son and I watched it, he got very little feel for the history of the time and was left mostly with the impression of a confused older woman who had fleeting memories from her past.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great little game. love playing it just don't like the whole using entertain thing other than that its not too bad.
0439023521|5.0|This was absolutely amazing!! Once you start you cannot put it down. It sucks you right in and you will not stop until you read the last sentence of the book. There is also a lot of suspense throughout the book. It is about a teenage girl, Katniss Everdeen who takes the place of her sister in the country's annual Hunger Games. The winner of the Games gets fame and fortune. This book takes you through her journey before and during the Hunger Games. Katniss's survival skills will either maker her and break her and who knows if she will sacrifice love and almost death to win. I recommend this book for ages 9+ because of the tricky language and great plot.

B006ICOK00|4.0|After conversing with tech support via email, the camera started working. (I didn't change any settings except to activate the LED light when a frame is being captured.)<br /><br />At any rate, I just wrapped up a three-week timelapse video, and the frames were all captured perfectly, and transfer to my computer was simple. I was very impressed by the low power consumption, and relatively small filesize of the rendered AVI. I was using this in an office environment to capture change of one of our visualization systems over a release cycle, and it was unobtrusive. I used it in conjunction with one of the Joby Gorillapods to wrap it around someone's desk, and it didn't bother them, either.<br /><br />My only real complaint is a feature request: I wish I could get the individual stills instead of a rendered video file without having to use mplayer to dump them to disk.<br /><br />================<br /><br />Previous review:<br />This camera turns off after 5 to 10 seconds of capture. Hitting the buttons on the back of the device do nothing; I have to power it off and back on again to get it to respond. The green LED that would indicate recording also turns off, so at least that's consistent.<br /><br />The display is incredibly bad. I had a better screen on my cellphone ten years ago--no exaggeration--which there's basically no need for in this day and age. The camera won't give you the raw images; only rendered video, which further decreases its usefulness. I only wish there had been more reviews before I took the plunge. Here's to hoping this saves someone else the time, trouble, and money.<br /><br />(FWIW, I read the manual cover to cover, and this definitely isn't user error. My firmware is also up-to-date.)
0345803485|1.0|I read several chapters and put it down. It is a good  book to spice up your love life if you aren't creative. Could be listed under the \\"self help\\" section for reading material.  Would like a good erotic novel as much as anyone but this book is nothing but advertising hype. Generously giving it a one star. Those in desperate need for erotic stimulation may find it helpful.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Blu-ray version review: I was so thrilled by the previews of this movie when it came out, and so disappointed upon discovering those ads cherry-picked the few action scenes out of this timewaster. DO NOT OVERLOOK the fact that Amazon's movie description compares this movie to Moulin Rouge right off the bat. Amazon is completely accurate. It's far more a whore-house musical than it is an action pic. If I hadn't read the movie's backstory on IMDB, I may or may not have understood that its scenes jump back and forth between three different realities. The movie Inception did that methodically and masterfully; this movie does it clumsily and without explanation. There's the initial reality where a terrible crime takes place, then an imagined reality (of a whore house) the main character envisions herself in after wrongfully being committed to a mental hospital, then a third reality (an action reality) that the character dreams of to escape her imagined whorehouse reality. I'm dreaming of a reality where I didn't watch this movie and instead had an entertaining evening. All that said, the soundtrack of the action scenes were good, and the cinematography was artfully and impressively executed. Perhaps then the best way to view this movie is with the sound off and running as a video background during a busy party. The Blu-ray transfer was also a disappointment - too many grainy scenes likely due to dim-lighting situations in which they were filmed. If you're at all inclined to still get this movie, stick with the DVD version.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use this app every day, especially for recipes. Since it syncs across the board, I can access the notes on my phone as well as my Kindle Fire.
B006PGL7OQ|3.0|This is a character study about a man who may - or may not - be suffering from a mental illness.  He has recurring nightmares of an apocalyptic storm which lead him to put the financial well-being of his family at risk to build a storm shelter.  Is he a prophet or is it the onset of schizophrenia?<br /><br />This low-budget indie film is what you call a slow burn.  It will be too slow for some, while others will be mesmerized.  There are a few visual effects shots, but this is no CGI-laden disaster flick.  The performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (as his patient but concerned wife) are excellent. This is a type of film that is all about getting inside the character and great acting.  Action is minimal and anyone expecting an action film will be greatly disappointed.  Most of the conflict here is internal.<br /><br />I would highly recommend renting this first if you haven't seen it.  Replay value will be low for a lot of people, as it is very slow-paced and somber.  The ending is designed to make you think and form your own interpretation (which might irritate you if you prefer things to be neatly wrapped up!).<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to people who enjoyed films like The Tree of Life, Melancholia, Martha Marcy May Marlene, The American, etc.  If you thought those were a bore, this might not be for you either.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|The charger works as promised. Sometimes it loses connection to computer while charging the mouse. The only way to get mouse to reconnect is to turn it off and on again. However this doesn't happen too often. Only reason why it was given 4 stars.

Love You Like A Love Song got into my head and by the second listen I really wanted the CD. I downloaded it for free on my Android. Awesomeness!

0061733199|5.0|I just wanted to start out by saying that I do not read books. I never really enjoyed reading novels. I didn't even get passed the second harry potter book, but I love reading this survival guide. There is so much usable information in this book. I'm not saying that I'm glued to it but when I'm on my lunch break I break it open and then I'm glued to it. I'm telling you, there isn't just information on how to survive the end of the world, there is lot's of info on how to be prepared for everyday situations like a car accident, or how to survive severe weather. If you feel that you are not prepared for any real dangerous situation or just not prepared for what you might come across when you walk out your door, then you need to read this book.

However, because of adobe flash issues that were never resolved I coulndn't watch it, so it was a waste of money.

B0001VV1GK|4.0|We purchased this parking garage for our 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas after reading numerous reviews.  We have been very pleased with this product.  It has held up very well after 5 months of almost daily use.  It works perfectly with Hot Wheel/Matchbox cars.  The elevator has worked well with no issues.  Some of the other reviews mentioned the detachable ramps as a negative, but I think they are a positive feature.  It allows my daughter to remove them when she wants more space to maneuver vehicles.  The reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the gas pumps underneath the ramp are very difficult to play with.  There are only about 4 inches of clearance between the bottom and the first level so it's not easy to access the gas pumps.  My daughter pretty much ignores them.  Overall, it's a great product and I highly recommend it!
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Great product for a great price. Enjoyable for my kindle fire.I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes rock music
B004PVKFR8|4.0|An eclectic mix of styles that works really well when you listen to the entire album. As a song by song product it sounds a bit more hit and miss, I don't think this would work well on shuffle because of that. The vocals and music are complementary throughout and the tempo really makes it an album that works well at work and in the car.<br /><br />My only gripe, is \\"Knights of Shame\\" and it's not that the song isn't any good it's the two minute blank space followed by one minute of what sounds like an outtake reel that chafes my... well you get the point. I really thought this \\"huge song - blank space - tiny bit of outtake\\" gimmick was dead and gone 10 years ago. I want it hit in the head with a shovel and buried again like the zombie it obviously is. I don't want to delete the song because it's good and really fits the album but I find the blank space and out of place end bit distracting.

B0041T4ML4|5.0|Once upon a time I read science fiction virtually nonstop. Twice upon a time, actually. First, as a teenager goggle-eyed over the prospects for encountering intelligent life elsewhere in the universe -- life perhaps more similar to me than normal humans -- and later, in the 1970s, when I actually wrote science fiction (or at least tried to) and even joined the Science Fiction Writers of America. (I'm an associate member to this day.) Of many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of science fiction novels I read over all those years, only a few stand out in my memory. I'll list them in a separate post.<br /><br />I fully expect The Windup Girl to join them on my list of all-time bests. It's that good. Like so many of the other truly outstanding sci-fi novels, The Windup Girl won both the Nebula Award of the Science Fiction Writers of America and the Hugo Award voted by fans.<br /><br />The action takes place in Bangkok sometime in the 23rd century. Sometime in the past, the oceans have risen twenty feet or more, and the city survives only because a visionary Thai king has built an enormous seawall, dikes, and pumps to hold back the waters of the annual monsoon. Genetic engineering has run amok around the globe, and the Thai Kingdom is one of few countries, perhaps the only country, still resisting the \\"calorie companies,\\" powerful food-exporting corporations headquartered in the American Midwest and in China. Having killed off virtually all traditional sources of food -- and hundreds of millions of people -- with genetically engineered plagues to increase their leverage in the market, the calorie companies hungrily eye Thailand and its own independent success in creating new fruits and nightshades capable of resisting the ubiquitous plant-killers.<br /><br />In this grim environment, so long removed from the 21st century, one character \\"wonders if it was really better in the past, if there really was a golden age fueled by petroleum and technology. A time when every solution to a problem didn't engender another.\\"<br /><br />Emiko, the windup girl, is herself a product of genetic engineering, a \\"New Person,\\" a Japanese construct born in a test tube, bred in a creche, and trained to be an obedient secretary, interpreter, and lover to the businessman who buys her. Emiko is now stranded in Thailand by the businessman, who found it more cost-effective to buy a new windup girl back in Japan rather than pay her passage home. She now works as a despised prostitute in a Bangkok brothel.<br /><br />Emiko is one of a large cast of memorable characters, each a finely rendered portrait of a human being tormented by personal demons, haunted by the ever-present ghosts of Thailand, and caught up in an ugly and unstable system. The others include Anderson Lake, an American calorie man who secretly represents AgriGen, one of the most powerful of the calorie companies; his secretary-manager, Hock Seng, an old Chinese-Malayan business tycoon who barely escaped the ethnic cleansing campaign waged by Malayan \\"Green Headband\\" Muslims; Captain Jaidee Rojjanasukchai, the celebrity \\"Tiger of Bangkok,\\" a fearless commander of the paramilitary \\"white shirt\\" troops of the Environment Ministry, charged with enforcing the genetic isolation of their country; Jaidee's sidekick, Lieutenant Kanya, a humorless woman who fights like a demon; and the warring heads of the country's two most powerful ministries, Environment and Trade, General Pracha and Akkarat.<br /><br />Hock Seng's musings seem to sum up much of what transpires in this brilliant novel:<br /><br />\\"All things are transient. Buddha says it is so, and Hock Seng, who didn't believe in or care about karma or the truths of the dharma when he was young, has come in his old age to understand his grandmother's religion and its painful truths. Suffering is his lot. Attachment is the source of his suffering. And yet he cannot stop himself from saving and preparing and striving to preserve himself in this life which has turned out so poorly.\\"<br /><br />(From [...])

Stir with a plot to frame Miles for murder and we have Miles going courting.<br />For those of us who know and love Ms. Bujold and her writting this is part of the unique maturation of her protagonist Miles and makes perfect sense. If you are not as familiar the blend of comedy of manners and science fiction may be unique. This author is always worthwhile, however this book will make even more sense if you begin one book back with Komarr.<br />This is a unique offering from a unique author with brains and heart all her own. All though all her book are written as stand alone novels, I might recommend starting one book back as I mentioned earlier. Or give yourself a real treat and read them all.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Season-2 of Sherlock presents even better plotting (complete with more great plot twists!) and acting and directing! I WAS CONSUMED BY IT FOR NINETY MINUTES!<br />Well-written, Sherlock Season-2 begins with \\"Scandal,\\" and the introduction of Irene Adler - beautiful, aloof and logical thief, a female version of Holmes, who sees her life's partner in Sherlock. They move through the flirtation dance of one-upmanship with the grace of a ballet, and impress and attract each other with each step of the case. When it comes down to picking one thing that makes a movie great, here, I choose the storyline, the plotting! Someone as notorious as Irene Adler, and James Moriarty, MUST be capable of very complex plots. And this is one for the ages! Just when I thought I had the plot figured out, it took me in a new direction (and I said \\"Oh, right!\\"). I LOVED EVERY MINUTE of it! Also, I think the direction and editing is also flawless. It moves along fast and furious, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. When will Season-3 get here? Believe me! This is Sherlock at his best! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK BBC!
0446563048|5.0|I loved Tony's candid tales of his commercial activities from University through until selling Zappo's. What an amazing ride! I also made a visit to Zappo's in Vegas after finishing the book so could see happiness in action. In summary, I'd highly recommend reading the book before visiting as the craziness begins to make some sense.

B0000041WV|5.0|These recordings are by far my favorite. Having played a good handful of the symphonies, I have had numerous opportunities to get many takes. From that, I have gathered these Kertesz recordings to be top of the line. The balance between all of the sections is really superb, no one instrument being improperly handled by faulty mic placement. To my bias, the horn playing on 7 & 8 are other-worldly; the principal horn playing is second to none.(It may be Barry Tuckwell, who was with the LSO between 1955-68).<br /><br />I think my favorite thing about these recordings are the proper amount of weights between slow, winding down melodies in the woodwinds to the blast of the full orchestra back at a sprite tempo. It is done so darn perfectly it is unreal. Truly great playing by the whole orchestra; such discipline.<br /><br />Truly my favorites.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I got this for a friend in the USA who is not familiar with the entertainer. My friend is also a fan of rhythm and blues and country and found Adele to have a similar appeal. She is very happy with the CD. It was delivered promptly and I will use Amazon again.

B005LAIH3G|1.0|You're looking at this and thinking - looks good , lots of five star reviews.<br /><br />Those are the result of a campaign by a small handful of misguided fans who are trying to convince Disney to throw another quarter of a billion dollars down the toilet for a sequel to - literally - THE BIGGEST FLOP IN HOLLYWOOD HISTORY.<br /><br />They're trying to make a case that bad marketing hurt the film, or that there's some kind of conspiracy amongst reviewers (the majority of whom said this movie was just 'ok' - if it hadn't had a 250 million dollar budget.  At that price, it is a TERRIBLE movie.)<br /><br />Read the books instead - most are available for free online AND you don't need a special pair of 3D glasses to enjoy the story.<br /><br />We need to wait another hundred years before allowing someone an attempt at this property - it will probably take that long for the sour taste to leave everyone's mouths.<br /><br />Tell me Hollywood is wrong:  John Carter flops and loses over two hundred million bucks for its studio.  This week, Disney's Avenger's rakes in just about that same amount in 1 week in the theater.  Maybe the critics are wrong.  Maybe the studio is wrong.  But the audience is never wrong.  They took a pass on John Carter and saved their dollars for The Avengers.<br /><br />Save YOUR dollars for the DVD of the Avengers as well. If you are really pining for John Carter material - its online and its FREE.

B004WR125O|2.0|This seemed OK when I first used it.  The internet radio worked fairly good when I installed it.  That was late at night.  Now, the reception seems to fade away every once in a while and it doesn't allow people to stream music through it once that happens.  We have two laptops and a home phone using the same internet connection around the house so that may affect the wifi activity.  The box clearly states that you shouldn't have other wifi devices around it.  One good attribute it has is that it tells you what your signal strength is.  I know the poor internet service can't be the router or the cable service I have since the other devices that use the incomming internet service seem to work just fine.  I changed the channel from 1 to 4 on the UWF-1 and it had trouble, it seemed to lock up the receiver (Onkyo TXNR-809).  I had to turn the power off from the receiver and unplug it in order to make it stop trying to update the firmware through the usb input.  I had already updated the firmware before using the UWF-1.  I don't think I have the kind of time needed to dedicate myself to it by making sure it operates correctly when I want to listed to music.  I am dissapointed, it takes too much of my time to get it up and running correctly.  It's not working for me because it seems my only option right now is to ask everyone else to get off the internet so I can listen to music.  I may have to see if there is an alternative device I can use to replace the UWF-1 for the Onkyo receiver I just purchased.  Otherwise I will have to hardwire the receiver.  Hardwiring the set up I have defeats the purpose of me purchasing the expensive equipment I just purchased.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|I just downloaded this one for my wife. She loves it! I believe these are classified as torch songs at least that seems appropiate. It is my wife's second Norah Jones album. Our daughter just borrowed the other CD so I assume this singer has a broad base of fans.

B0042IQDVG|5.0|I was not a big fan od Stewart in his younger years, but his Great American Songbook album series is in my opinion his best work yet. The songs seem to fit his raspy voice.

B007BVOF8E|5.0|First off, let me say that I agree with many of the complaints that those critical of the film put forward:  the movie is slow and difficult to follow.  However, that's exactly what I love about the movie - so much that I watched it a second time to try and take in all the nuance and detail of the film.  This isn't a film for someone who wants a rock'em sock'em spy action thriller.  It's a film in which you get slowly dragged into the environs, intrigue and plot through incredible acting and film making, but only with an effort by the viewer to track what's happening, understand each character and their motivations as well as the significance of each scene.  I haven't read the book, but I imagine pages dedicated to each of the key characters, and that detail has been poured into each frame and line of dialogue in the movie, making it a bit tough to dissolve unless you are paying close attention. In the end, if you pay attention, you experience the same level of adrenaline as a Bourne Identity and suspense as a Hitchcock, but only if you pay close attention.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I always feel like the cheap books for kindle need a separate rating system since you don't really expect much from them. But this book is not in that category. This book is 5 stars no matter what it costs.<br /><br />The author sucks you in and keeps you there not wanting to put the book down. I won't rehash the plot since so many already have I'll just give the points of what I look for in reviews before I buy a book. I like that the author doesn't give endless pages of boring background. And the romance between the two main characters is on from the get-go.<br /><br />And there are surprises along the way. I thought that was great because I've read a lot of books, seen a lot of stuff, and was very happy this one wasn't cliche.<br /><br />It also deals with some hard topics in a good way. I don't want to read a book just to cry my eyes out for pages on end. The author could portray tough subjects and I could feel for Lake (the main character) without feeling like a needed endless boxes of tissues.<br /><br />I'm not a \\"young adult\\" but I read a lot of YA because a lot of adult novels are filled with trash and filth. I was glad this book (and the 2nd book of the series) was not. =) There is cussing but not a ton. And there are realistic kissing scenes but no sex. =)<br /><br />Definitely a must read!!!!
B006PTL1QM|3.0|Mighty Magneto Massbender administers some rather forceful slaps to Lizzy Bennet's bottom while Aragorn watches and the Duke of Anjou fans himself.

1440503257|4.0|My older son, age 8.5, checked this book out of the library and enjoyed it so much that we got a copy to keep.  He is a big Harry Potter fan and a reasonably non-picky eater, but this book really has encouraged him both to try his hand at cooking on his own (Hagrid's Rock Cakes) and to help cook family meals that are a lot more adventurous than usual (e.g., Slughorn's Savory Chicken & Mushroom Pie).  The recipes themselves - though selected based on the theme of the books - are not gimmicky but instead are reasoanbly legitimate versions of standard fare that is featured or mentioned in the Harry Potter books.  Some minor modifications help to modify recipes to individual tastes (for instance, I made a darker roux and added some vegetables and more herbs to the aforementioned chicken pie) but most of the base recipes are pretty good on their own.

B006OFN0SE|2.0|Rated \\"R\\". Running Time: 2 hours, 16 min.<br /> The adult life of J. Edgar Hoover is dramatized in this movie as we see him as the Appointed Director of the Bureau of Investigation. The movie jumps around through his life from 1919 to 1972. In 1921, he became the Deputy head of the Bureau of Investigation.  He had no wife, no girlfriend, practically no social life, and so, the Attorney General promoted him to Appointed Director in 1924.  J. Edgar became obsessed with wanting to solve crimes, including the disappearance of the Charles Lindbergh baby case. He believed that \\"information was power\\" and used wire-tapping. The organization he created was the introduction of fingerprint files, crime labs and agents. He also kept personal and confidential files on several people and anyone that was after him, he wanted them investigated and a file started on them. He wanted agents to photograph them.<br />  J. Edgar kept his personal life very private. This movie depicts his speculated personal life as having a relationship with Clyde Tolson, his FBI Associate Director for nearly 40 years. Whatever went on behind closed doors of their homes will never be known, however in the end, Hoover left his entire estate to Tolson.<br /><br /> Leonardo Dicaprio as \\"J.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I always look forward to the next offering by Mr King, and this was no exception.  Honestly, after reading the liner notes, I had no idea if I would like this book or not.  I've only got about 30 or 40 pages left, and I gotta tell you, this book is great!  It's a real page turner & I find myself making excuses to disappear and read a chapter or two throughout the day.  I even have my wife reading it.  I had to convince her it wasn't about vampires, ghosts, or goblins though since she is not a horror story fan.  She too is enjoying this book.  Mr King never ceases to amaze me with his imagination and wit.  I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!
0345803485|5.0|There has been so much focus on this book because of the erotic scenes, but there is so much more than that, to this story. This is a modern romance between a naiive, recent college graduate and a handsome, rich man who has had a rough start in life. Ana and Christian's story pulled me in immediately and entertained me throughout!<br /><br />I could not put this book down. Please keep writing, EL!!  A book telling the story from Christian's viewpoint would be awesome!

1416955070|3.0|This book was exceedingly slow for me to get into plot wise, but was also interesting because of the things that you learn leading up to the good stuff! My main issue with this book was that it seemed to drag on forever over the least interesting things and I don't believe that it actually started to reel me in until 3/4ths of the way through the book.<br /><br />It was cliche on some levels, but a good book if you want a quick thrill.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had heard little about this series until the movie was coming out and then I heard about it from tons of people I knew.  Still, I was a little slow to click \\"buy!\\"  When faced with a 10 hour plane trip to London for spring break, I decided it was time.  Loved, loved, loved it!  Couldn't put it down for the first two in the series...and made myself slow down a bit for the third so I could enjoy it just a little longer.  Highly recommend it - great storyline, description, adventure, romance...etc.  If you're a parent and not sure if it's right for your child, I highly recommend reading it first - there are some themes that might be tough for some kids to handle.

I am not an HBO subscriber but so many of my friends talked about the show that I had to see what all the fuss was about - ABSOLUTELY amazing imagery, costumes, fight (and love) scenes - WOW!!!  Can't wait for Season Two to come available so I can order it too!!!
0385040253|5.0|Great images and detailed examples of knot usage. This book should be in everyones shelfes.<br />Shipment and handling was perfect to.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I don't know what all the hype is about. This story was disappointing.  I kept reading just to see if the plot might get better. Most of the \\"games\\" part was quite boring and only one situation at the end of the games might be seem gory to a young person. I think this book would appeal more to 7th - highschool students. Not for the mature reader.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never was a Buffy fan. That was my wife and daughter. I bought the movie Serenity' without knowing Josh had directed it (not a Buffy fan). It became one of my favorite movies. If you can believe it I bought the series Firefly on a whim, not knowing the connection between Buffy, Josh, and Serenity. I learned after watching the special features on the movie. While I didnt like the series as much as the movie ( I believe I was spoiled by seeing the movie first)I believe it is one of the best series that I have stumbled upon. I can not believe that those in charge of what stays or goes on T V didnt give the creator of Buffy more than one season.(what idiots) They didnt give Josh fans time to find it, I hope whoever cancled it at least got demoted ( I cant hope for some to lose their job)( probably someones nephew or son) This was such an error in judgement, this could have evolved into such a very entertaining series.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Thought I ought to read this since everyone else has.  Books were just okay, but I've read worse.<br /><br />I had to wonder how a society that possessed stealth technology, aircraft cloaking devices, and was capable of manipulating DNA was still dependent on coal.  The overall plot was fairly easy to figure out in advance, and the characters were pretty shallow; but I guess that is to be expected when one reads \\"young adult\\" literature or watches network TV.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was fairly good, Catching Fire was a little better, but I had to force myself to read the last 100 pages of Mockingjay; trilogies are tough; by the third one everybody is getting tired of the story, even the author.  Star Wars, of course, is the exception.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to agree completely with the other reviewers who pointed out that:<br /><br />A) the book is unoriginal, and not very well-written,<br />B) the book is filled with annoying \\"Britishisms\\" (ringing someone, saying something is \\"horrid\\", etc.),<br />C) the protagonist is constantly \\"biting her lip\\" or musing in her head about how \\"hot\\" Christian is,<br />D) Christian certainly wouldn't be interested in anyone as inexperienced or naive as she is,<br />E) the whole email sequence is incredibly dry and boring,<br />F) the book is one big overblown cliche, and is not very compelling at all.<br /><br />Basically, the marketing and hype is overblown, and it is absolutely amazing to me that people claim to love this book or this series. I couldn't get through the first half of the book without telling everyone I know how ridiculously bad it really is. I certainly won't be reading the other half of the book, nor any others in the series. It's a total waste of time. Reading the Wikipedia entry on BDSM would be ten times more erotic than this badly-written \\"novel.\\"
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I see this book every time i go into a book store and i had heard of its success so i thought i would give it a try even though it didnt sound great from what i had heard... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you have no appreciation for good writing, believable characters and plot, or your own sanity. Seriously, it was a compelte waste of my time!!! One of the most annoying things in this laughable trilogy was the langauge...the female character says &#34;jeez,&#34; &#34;oh crap,&#34; &#34;double crap,&#34; and even &#34;triple crap&#34; about 15 times in the first chapter. Quality my ass!!! There are gramatical errors left right and centre, causing me to become completely frustated with this novel. One of the worst i have ever read forsure. A bit of advice before you buy: read at least five of these reviews that all say the same obvious things about this book, and also try the sample so you dont waste your money and can see for yourself!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so happy that they finally put this app in the store to buy! I love being able to play on the big screen! I totally recommend to get this app!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Like most guys, I grew up with comic books, albeit before Marvel came along.  I loved most of the DC comics led by Superman and Batman but also a more obscure crew known as the \\"Blackhawks.\\"  They were a group of mortals from various countries who came together to fight evil.  DC would often have collaborations as well, bringing Flash, The Green Lantern into the mix, eventually becoming the Justice League of America.  Marvel Comics came along in about 1967 to challenge DC with a new cast of characters, many of which are gathered in this movie.<br /><br />Guided by one of the great up-and-coming director/writers of the day, Joss Whedon (\\"Cabin in the Woods\\", \\"Serenity\\") is the perfect director for this sure to be blockbuster.  Admittedly I liked the previous Marvel films leading up to this big group hug, especially \\"Ironman.\\"  Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn manage to inject plenty of humor to offset what could be the possible destruction of mankind.  Loki (Tom Hiddleston, \\"War Horse\\") returns as Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) adopted brother and drops in on Earth from their alternate world to capture a glowing energy source known as the Tesseract.  Naturally he and his ugly henchmen know as the Chitauri have evil intent but need the Tesseract and/or a fuel source known as iridium to fully open the portal to get them there.<br /><br />Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) leads a group known as S.H.I.E.L.D which has been established to defend Earth from alien visitors including those like Loki's crew.  Over time (and several previous movies) Fury and his top agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) have co-opted Thor, Ironman (always good Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers, AKA Capt. America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and now Bruce Banner, AKA The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) into the fold.  Whedon manages to keep us on the edge of our seat with explosive confrontations between the super heroes as we wait patiently for The Hulk to get pissed off enough to show his destructive self.<br /><br />One of the big surprises was the appearance of Cobie Smulders who smolders as Agent Hill, Fury's top military aide.  Ms. Smulders, perhaps best known for TV's \\"How I Met Your Mother,\\" looks great with a bloody face, packed into black leatherette and kicking bad guy ass.  I expect we'll be seeing more of her in the movies.  Even at 2 hours, 22 minutes the film moves along briskly for the most part.  The ultimate concluding battle is pretty much what we can expect.  The invading Chitaurians have quick moving space-sleds as well as huge metallic worm-like creatures/machines that far outnumber our heroes.  Still, we have The Hulk.  New York City takes another destructive CGI blow.  Marvel's \\"The Avengers\\" certainly ranks as one of the best films of the genre.  I saw this film in IMAX 3-D which was very very good.  Impressive enough to kick the rating up a 1/2 star.  Highly recommended.his destructive self.<br /><br />One of the big surprises was the appearance of Cobie Smulders who smolders as Agent Hill, Fury's top military aide.  Ms. Smulders, perhaps best known for TV's \\"How I Met Your Mother,\\" looks great with a bloody face, packed into black leatherette and kicking bad guy ass.  I expect we'll be seeing more of her in the movies.  Even at 2 hours, 22 minutes the film moves along briskly for the most part.  The ultimate concluding battle is pretty much what we can expect.  The invading Chitaurians have quick moving space-sleds as well as huge metallic worm-like creatures/machines that far outnumber our heroes.  Still, we have The Hulk.  New York City takes another destructive CGI blow.  Marvel's \\"The Avengers\\" certainly ranks as one of the best films of the genre.  I saw this film in IMAX 3-D which was very very good.  Impressive enough to kick the rating up a 1/2 star.  Highly recommended.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|:)<br />the game is such a piece of crape for a dollar.! I do not need this kind of stuff in mylife my guys like really come on
B0054JZC6E|4.0|haven't played much but when I do its when I'm traveling and while not the best the games are fun and interesting. recommended for bored kids who don't like reading
B007SYWFRM|3.0|this game wouldn't let me quit without restarting my kindle!!!!!It also is very bad because you have to spend real money
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app! It is easy to use and share verses via Facebook, Twitter or  text! I just wish thatwe were able to have a split screen view so that we could view side by side with a Bible commentary or another Bible.....that would be awesome!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Contains spoilers.<br />Worst book I have EVER read!!!! I mean Kantiss kills Coin instead of Snow!!!!????!!!! Disapontment to the series. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE OUTRAGED!!!!!!
B007MG360G|5.0|I think this game is so much fun. You can make the coolest things. I also really like Doodle God( but make sure to do the kid safe. I really like this game it is so much fun
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How can this be a best seller? In all honesty, this feels like a first draft written by a 14 year old. It's awful. I try to be relatively kind in my reviews, but this book has no redeeming qualities. The quality of the writing is so bad... if this was properly edited it would be only about 50 pages in length. Terrible...
1400064287|5.0|This is an excellent book! The authors have identified those factors that make an idea become viral and the stuff of legend regardless of whether or not its true, correct or even any good. They have included plenty of evidence in the form of case studies and tips on how to use the information to make your ideas \\"sticky\\". Often books such as these are interesting but give you no clue as how to apply what they tell you to your own life. The fact that this one does makes it stand out for me. Its also nice and easy to read. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone involved in marketing, copy writing, journalism, writing or blogging.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|super Mario bros lite. fairly simple just run and get the gold coins. no flower fireballs or star invincibility.  ok for kids.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very relaxing and easy game.  It is also challenging. I don't think I will ever grow tired of this game.
0345803485|1.0|I,too, just read the first 8 pages here. Complete and utter drivel. It's so juvenile and pandering that it feels like a children's author was trying to write naughty book to make herself feel 'all grown up'. My advice? Buy a Nancy Friday book, any one will be a better choice. Erotica for grown-ups. I'm no kid, but this is just plain immature.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game! Works flawlessly on the Amazon Kindle Fire.  Time passes so quickly while playing this game. Lookong forward to additions.
B000002UY5|5.0|Someday all the world will remember about Blind Melon is the pudgy girl jumping around in the bee costume.  This is indeed a shame because this is one of the most uniquely beautiful albums of its era.  It is sonorous, complex, a rich tapestry of interwoven sound.  One of the most remarkable qualities of the album and the band is their ability to juxtapose harsh, cacophonous, dissonant passages with soothing, delightful, joyous sounds, thus rendering the latter all the more beautiful.  In addition to the wonderous \\"No Rain\\", the album is jam packed with tremendous songs, including \\"Dear Old Dad\\" and the  unbelievably underrated \\"Holy Man\\".  It is especially beautiful as driving music--there have been times when it's occupied a place of honor in my Subaru CD changer for weeks at a time.  Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|we really enjoy this game as a family. It's also nice to not need the Internet to play. The only drawback is if you don't have any friends who play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Simply put, I love this app! The reading plans are great and a helpful guide when reading the Bible! I would recommend this app.
1401233384|5.0|Very good plot, the Batman of this story is a role model for all of us , he sacrificed himself for the best reason....<br /><br />This story Reminds me in some way the age of apocalypse... mainly by the map in the final page and for some other details.<br /><br />A one MUST READ for all the comic books fans.
B004EPYZUS|3.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable action flick with great gadgets, car chases, good fight scenes and Tom Cruise who's not taking himself too seriously. But gee, he beefed up for this movie, photoshopped perhaps?<br /><br />Yes, if you enjoy this type of movie, you've probably seen it all before including a nuclear threat on America. But it was fun, and very easy to watch.<br /><br />And it's set up for number 5 which surprised me.
0618871713|5.0|My daughter convinced me I'd like this book. I purchased it but it sat on my shelf for a while. When I finally read it, I loved. I've recommended it to many.<br /><br />If you haven't ready a graphic novel before, this is one to jump in on. You won't regret it.<br /><br />I plan to following Alison's writing career and expect to read many of her books.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|why does it get screwed up? timers all at 130 hours. was loving the game but unplayable! please fix ASAP!!!!
B00004SU5J|5.0|I came to this album through the track \\"Sure Thing\\" which I overheard sitting in a coffee house one afternoon.<br /><br />Since I was unable to download just that track from Amazon I bought the full album. I did so with some trepidation because I was really only interested in that one track and I was annoyed at the thought of getting a lot of lame tracks for the single great one.<br /><br />I shouldn't have worried. I usually have to go through a new album a few times before I start to fall in love with it.<br /><br />Not this one. I'm writing this review while still only two thirds through the first time listening to it.<br /><br />Totally confident that it's a great album because \\"Sure Thing\\" is second to last on the play list and I haven't reached it yet.<br /><br />I'm glad I got the full album. It's joyful, restrained, cool and soulful all at once.
B003L77G10|5.0|I loved the series.  I can't wait to watch it again.  I was distraught about Alisha leaving Peter!  I felt even worse about Alisha being so mean to Colleta and not forgiving her.  Alisha is a magnificient lawyer, but she needs to have some forgiveness!!  It was an excellent series, and I was very pleased with my purchase and delivery was speedy.  Thanks, Gina Cheney
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is greater it really seems like ice age and it is fun because I get to make my own village
B007R41E8O|5.0|I loved this game,  it kept me entertained for a few days. I do not care for the games that only take about 30 minutes to win. Loved it!
B000E8EUJ0|5.0|it's a good movie if you like history/true stories... its a good movie with a lot of action and adventure to keep you on the edge of your seat... and it's easy to get into this movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am completely addicted to this on my Kindle Fire. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys spider solitaire!
B0062P3392|4.0|i like this movie... its very jason statham though... i like that they used him for this role though... no one else could have done it like jason.<br />thumbs up
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a good game to play the graphics are great there should be more ways to get accorns then just buying them that would be nice
B0017S66JI|3.0|it is the same movie as quarantine, but in a different language. lol i felt so silly when i realized it. :) but the movie isnt bad. :)
0307341577|3.0|I read the excellent [[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects: A Novel]] and then ordered this from my library (are we allowed to confess doing that here?) and was glad that it was a loan and not a purchase. This book was darker than Sharp Objects and the characters less relatable. It's still really well written,  Ms Flynn has a gift for sentences and images,  but on the whole the characters were so unlikeable and the d&eacute;nouement was so unlikely that it didn't work for me.  I was a litle bit disappointed.  I would still read another Flynn book, but the ill-fated Day family is not one I needed to spend time with...  Go read Sharp Objects - it's amazing!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've never read any Stephen King books. This is the first book I have read from him, and, it was very good. I found it very hard to put this one down. The plot is very interesting, and the way Stephen King writes makes it feel like you are back in 1963 with Jake Epping. Being as long as it is, I couldn't seem to find any parts of this book that did not interest me. The whole idea of Time Travel is interesting, and Stephen King did a fantastic job with 1963.
0345803485|1.0|This is just terrible writing.  Heaven forbid I even call this garbage literature! I seriously wish I could give this book ZERO stars!  Fifty shades of Gray is not even a good book for people who are new to reading BDSM! I don't understand how E.L. got sooo much publicity! If you want real BDSM Romance read The Rescue Me Series by the Kallypso Masters. Sooo worth it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|second best game ever. all I can say is get it for hours of entertainment!!!!! lep's world rules!!!!!! u will b so glad u got it!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061726834|1.0|I started reading this book and must say I LOVED it... Until, that is, I got to two f-words.<br />Think about it, two f-words in a teen novel. What does that say about our society?<br /> What shocks me the most about this is how oblivious parents are to what their teens are reading. I'm thirteen, and<br />I'm horrified at how many people my age and older are reading this book and others like it. Parents, don't judge a book by its cover; read it yourself BEFORE your kids do! Because once somethings in your mind it NEVER leaves. So the next time your kid picks up a book, do some research on it or read in yourself.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This series is so riveting and captivating that there were times that I had to look away. I loved the first 4 seasons and wish that season 5 was not the last one although I know there is not a whole lot they could do after Gus is killed.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|it was so sweet<br />it was so awesome<br />it was the coolest<br />it was the bestest<br />it was so sweet
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The product was what i expected. It arrived on time. I love this movie, I saw it a lot of times when I was a kid.
B007SGM084|1.0|I've heard a lot of hype about these books and thought I'd try them out, not knowing what they are about.  Now, I am certainly not opposed to a little slap and tickle, but I am opposed to mediocre writing styles and cheesy descriptions.  How many times do we have to hear about Miss Steele's \\"internal goddess\\" and how many times did I want to shake her and tell her to grow a spine and brains and not to get involved with Mr. Grey?  These books hurt my soul.  I bought all three, but I can't do it anymore.  I stopped after the first chapter of Book 2.  They annoyed me too much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|GREAT PRICE. GREAT BEGINNING BOOK THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO READ ON TO THE NEXT ONE.<br />GOOD STORY AND I'M NOT A SCI-FI READING PERSON.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love my Bible app its super easy to use thanks for putting it on kindle fire cuz I love it!!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|great to read papers - nothing fancy just great reader for the kindle fire. I guess you can even read pdfs directly on the kindle without this, but either way, I like the adobe reader. Nothing much to add to this as I dont do anything else on it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I don't know y people r giving it a bad review the title clearly says k.f.e.(kindle fire edition) I'he been waiting for this to come out fir a looooonnnng time so I'm glad its out
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I found this game to be an awesome time waster, the adds aren't excessive, and most of the game instructions are easy to follow.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I just did for the points so yeah that is my review I hope you guys liked it more then I did
B00002DE4L|5.0|AMAZING!!!!Still Crazy ROCKS! For anyone who loves great pop/rock songs, this is the cd for you! \\"The Flame Still Burns\\", \\"What Might Have Been\\", \\"All Over The World\\" are my favorites. I wish they were a touring band. I'd buy tickets in a heartbeat!!!!!! I saw the movie first, and the story was so funny, and so touching. It just made me laugh and cheer and want to jam!!! FANTASTIC!!!
B0068FZ0YM|4.0|Warning to foreign buyers: I already own this movie on blu ray, and it's definitely a 5-star experience, but I bought this release purely to obtain the digital copy.<br /><br />When I opened the box, I found that the digital copy is accessed via the Universal website. When I try to access the download, I'm refused because I'm in Australia.<br /><br />It doesn't concern me what the reason for this blockage is, it amounts to theft. Nowhere on the product page does it indicate that the digital copy is blocked in other countries.  If I had known that the digital copy wouldn't work, I would not have bought this set. I feel that I've wasted my money, and I won't be buying any further Universal discs that falsely advertise digital copies included.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is very cute game!  I really love it! but need more minigames and movies! and better to have more free ways to get more acorns :)
B0000AC8N4|5.0|This 1963 date is titled for Dexter Gordon's living in self-imposed Parisian exile and recording there with two other exptriates and a French native. Along with Gordon, pianist Bud Powell and Kenny \\"Klook\\" Clarke were living in the City of Lights and were joined by the brilliant French bassman Pierre Michelot. This is a freewheeling bop date with the band working out on such categoric standards as \\"Scrapple from the Apple,\\" and \\"A Night in Tunisia.\\" In addition, American vernacular tunes such as \\"Willow Weep for Me\\" and \\"Stairway to the Stars\\" are included. Gordon is at the very top of his game here. His playing is crisp, tight, and full of playful fury. Powell, who at this stage of his life was almost continually plagued by personal problems, never sounded better than he does in this session. His playing is a tad more laid-back here, but is nonetheless full of the brilliant harmonic asides and incendiary single-note runs he is legendary for. The rhythm section is close-knit and stop-on-a-dime accurate.<br /><br />I might mention that D.G. was in a movie produced by Clint Eastwood called \\"Round Midnight.\\" The story goes that the theme of the movie was a reflection of his own life. Read his Bio & you might agree. Also, Eastwood produced a movie called \\"Bird\\", about Charlie Parker as well as \\"Straight No Chaser\\" a documentary about Thelonius Monk. He also uses a lot of jazz in the sound tracks of his movies. There's a good reason for this. Eastwood started out as a jazz pianist before he got into movies.His son Kyle plays bass professionally, & has his own trio.
0446572993|2.0|I've read most of his books and I thought that this book just dragged on.  I got right into the book, but the middle of the book seemed to run on.  I was anxious to get to the ending just to finish it and I had figured out the killer. I see all of those good reviews, but I didn't care for it. The ending was exciting.  Did I miss something--seemed like a lot of stuff just to get to Will???
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy unlocking the games; its fun getting to the next set of games to unlock the rest of the other games.
0345529057|5.0|This set is perfect if your looking for the first 4 novels by George R. R. Martin! The books are the smaller Mass Market Paperbacks so if you want a taller slimmer novel I'd buy them individually. They also come in a nice slip case so you can keep them all together! I haven't had a chance to read them so I will probably update this in the future to comment on the content. Packaging wise they are perfect!
1878424114|5.0|If you have not got it now of what life purpose is and why you are here, what you must do while you are here you need to read this book and re-read this book. All of lifes answers are in this book.Thank youi so much.
B0080CKGZE|5.0|Based on the novel by Guy de Maupassant this movie is a drastic turn from Robert Pattinson's performance in the Twilight Saga. Set in 19th century France and Georges Duroy's(Pattinson)quest for fortune bring Pattinson's acting skill to a new level. Stellar performances by Robert Pattinson, Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci. A must see for those who love any of the actors in the film.
B005KDWUFA|3.0|Something isn't right...can't explain what it is. This latest (Wicked Game) just wasn't as good as their other works. Well maybe, it's the comparison to our new young talent in IL VOLO???
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I searched and searched for a case. I am pleased with how light weight the case is and it still stands. I keep it in my purse and it the entire kindle is covered.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can I say, as Iv'e just left The Avengers movie? It's a comic book straight from the pages and onto the screen. What Marvel fans have been waiting for for years, and it all began with the success of Raimi's \\"Spider-Man\\" and Singer's \\"X-Men\\", Marvel Studios green lit the Avengers project that started off in 2008 with Iron Man, along with Captain American, Thor, Incredible Hulk and a second Iron Man. This all takes us to this film, which I cannot describe other than a perfect adaptation and feeling of a superGROUP movie. Which is harder to do than a solo film. There is no filler in this, every moment is eyes wide open and moves along at a perfect pace.  It's a perfect translation from comics to film, wonderfully casted and no Avenger is lackluster, everyone shines and all have great screen time, even Sgt.Fury kick arse. Hulk is epic, effects and sound are great. I'll probably see this again.<br /><br />Director Joss Whedon (\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Firefly\\");as well as writing comic books, was the perfect director for this project. His vision was epic.<br /><br />Here's my one word for this movie: AWESTRUCK, or SMASH!!!<br /><br />Can't wait for the blu-ray transfer and watch it several more times.  GO SEE THIS!!!! \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is going to have some fierce competition.<br />DECIDED TO KNOCK THIS FILM DOWN TO 4 STARS. SORRY, BATMAN: TDKR IS THE BEST COMIC BASED FILM.<br /><br />And don't forget to stay through the credits, if your a geek like me, you'll know the villain in the sequel. Genius. And one does not simply leave a Marvel movie without staying till the end.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Highly disappointed about the quality of this manuscript. Poor as hell. Dont loose yor money buying it. Just go to your favorite cinema. As simple as that. Have you heard the sentence \\"the book is better than the film\\"? well this is 100% against that statement.
B00718Y3CA|5.0|Wonderful movie - Every Dad Should see it, especially if you have teenagers.<br />Prompt delivery and excellent quality. They should show this in school.
B000V6ACJ2|5.0|I have the original, but I sometimes DJ parties where explicit lyrics aren't appropriate. I saw this album, including the non-explicit version on sale for $3.00 on Amazon (MP3 Download), and I couldn't resist getting it in the non-explicit version. Thanks Amazon.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|tons of fun shooting zombies.  Tower defense side scroll game and worth a try.  i just wish there were more levels
B001P9EQH8|1.0|The sound boost from this amplifier is minimal.  it's worthless, in my opinion.  Unfortunately I didn't test these when they arrived, and now the return window has passed.  $20 wasted.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this is worth the money; after I started it I couldn't put it down untill I finished it.<br /><br />the game play is fantastic and the history line is well played with the riddles.
B007X16GFC|2.0|I've certainly enjoyed some of the amazing films that Mark Wahlberg has done over the past few years. Also, Kate Beckinsale shows us once again that she is not just a pretty face, but is a really talented actress. Overall, the acting in this movie is pretty good. The cast is a strong ensemble of some very talented people. Walhberg and Beckinsale's talent shows through, while others, who I know to be good actors struggled.<br />  I'm not a picky movie person unless I want to be. That is, when I don't like something, I begin to notice every fault it has. To be clear I love action movies with not a lot of plot and great action sequences. Put together a decent plot and blow some things up and I'll be one happy moviegoer. This movie couldn't even manage that. The Direction was downright awful. The really talented actors were able to make you believe their characters dispite this, but others, who I have really enjoyed watching in other things just couldn't pull it off. This is not surprising considering how truly awful the script was. I felt like there was half the story missing, most movies of this genre start with \\"the last job\\" before \\"retirement,\\" then move onto how the protagonist gets dragged into one last job to save their family, friends etc. This movie dumps you halfway into a plot with the characters giving lame, forced explanations of \\"the past life.\\"<br />  I don't mind a predictable plot, I don't mind a plot with twists and turns. This movie managed to have twists I didn't expect, but was more confused by then surprised. It was predictable in places, but it all seemed too convenient. Instead of those tense moments where you don't know how the characters are going to get out of it, but somehow they do, those moments are skipped altogether, and they are explained later on like a great problem was solved, even though you didn't know there was one.<br />  Since I'm being a movie snob, the cinematography was sub par and the editing was not much better then I coulddo with my Mac Book Pro and iMovie. The movie had a strange coloring too it, that I just didn't see any reason for. Yes, I know you can color-balance the movie to look \\"gritty\\" but at least have a good reason for it.<br />  My movie standards aren't that high (as I said, when I don't like something, I'll see every problem). I love the Die-Hard tetralogy (which are excellent), movies like \\"Shooter\\" (which is totally underrated) \\"The transporter\\" and even \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\" This movie couldn't even meet my pretty low standards for an action films. Don't waste your time and money on this snorer.
1451673442|5.0|If you like the secret, this book is a must. I learned more and it answered more of my questions. You owe it to yourself to check this book out.  =oD
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I like it because it has a little excitement to it. I think its a copy of Super Mario Brothers though.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app! you don't even have to buy any song because you can just get it off of this app! I highly recommend getting this aapp because it is amazing!! :)
B007PTJOV0|4.0|real easy to play.  enjoyable to play on kindle fire and ipod touch. my five yr old niece and I both like to play so for all age groups.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|When I put this show in my Queue on netflix and it came, I remembered thinking it was ok when it was being played in reruns on ABC family. But I became obsessed with the show once I started watching the episodes in order and finding myself barely able being to wait until the next disc could be delivered, and once season 1 had such a cliffhanger, I knew I was hooked!<br /><br />Great price also!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I purchased this after reading reviews for many different inflatable pools.  I was very impressed when we inflated it, it seems to be a quality plastic that won't pop easily and it is a great size, I can even lay in it while he splashes around.  TIP - I would get an electric inflator and blow up in 2 minutes, it would take a really long time and some passing out before you could get this blow this yourself.  He loves to use the sides to stand up on and crawls around all over the pool, he also loves the sprinklers on the sides and the inflatable whale that came with the pool.  I put him in for 30 minutes and he takes a great nap after wearing himself out, best $30 bucks spent.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|Florence and the Machine has such a way with music, vocals, and lyrics.  She paints a picture with her words and those pictures stick with you.  While other albums have come and gone since this album's release, I repeatedly come back to this album time and time again.  It is a very moving, thought-provoking, deeply emotional record that gets better and better with each listen.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An Excellent Read! I was hooked from the begining adn could not put my kindle down until all three were finished.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|This album reminds me of Christmas albums of old.  I know it may sound strange, but I feel like this is what Bing Crosby would sound like if he were around to make a Christmas album in 2011.  It is modern, classic, and fun all at the same time.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Although listed as a YA book, it certainly held the attention of this 57 year old.  I loved the strong heroine -and the hunky hero.  The concept that anyone with two different colored eyes had a \\"grace\\" that could be anything - some much more useful than others.  But all Gracelings (especially the useful ones) belong to the king and therein lies a lot of the tension.  The characters are complex and some parents will not be happy with the violence or with the fact that the main character Krista is anti-marriage.  But Krista provides such a strong role model in other ways - gifted as a fighter but developing a conscience so that she begins to use her strengths for good.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I will not be able to say enough good things about the Zoom H4N in this review. It is a great audio recording tool. I have not used it in an application where it did not perform perfectly. I sometimes mount it to my DSLR for hand held recording. Often times, I mount it to a tri-pod in front of me when I'm making videos for [...]. For the price, this is one amazing piece of equipment. For the independent film maker, this is a necessity if you want to capture great audio. It was obviously designed by someone who knows what they are doing. You will be amazed at what such a small piece of equipment can do. I won't make videos without it anymore.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I love these type of games and this one is not dissappointing me yet.  Been playing for about 3 hours&hellip; and as much as I can tell there is much more to play.<br /><br />I love these alowar games, though I could not get past chapter 3 of the Snark adventure.  Would appreciate any advice on how to get through that!<br /><br />Anyways. great game.  Highly recommended.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so much fun! It's like Mario Bros but with leprachauns. Good touch sensitivity and graphics on the Fire.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie its so funny and cute watching her dance and clap to the singing chipmunks. Its a fun and silly movie if you sit down and watch it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|At first I was very excited about this book and to see what would happen and to see if there would be a war. I was happy with the book up until the point where it started to just get down right depressing and where Katniss just basically gave up on life. I felt that Katniss for some reason in this book was not the same character as she was in the first two. I understand that different life occurances happened and that is probably the reason she changed, but I didn't like the way she changed. I thought instead of her kind of feeling sorry for herself and for some reason not being good at anything but shooting an arrow, she should have been pissed and risen to the challenge to kill the capitol at all cost and in my opinion with the length of training she recieved she should have been the best assasin there was ever created. However, I do think the book went pretty well and I liked how it ended. I just didn't like that all the main characters you came to love in books one and two either died or were mentally screwed up.<br /><br />All in all this was a good book, just wish it would have went a little differently.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|I had previously seen the Swedish version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo starring Michael Nvqvist (also in the American version) and the incomparable Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. It was, simply put, brilliant. When I heard that there was to be an American version and Daniel Craig, with his incredible acting talent, was cast as the investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, I thought I would naturally love the film. True to form, though I loved Michael Nyqvist's adaptation of this character, Mr. Craig did a wonderful job. In my opinion, the major stumbling block was attempting to replace Noomi Rapace in the part of Lisbeth Salander. While watching the American version, I simply could not get past the inability of Rooney Mara to \\"eat up\\" the role as Lisbeth as Noomi did. Noomi Rapace was meant for this role and it was a serious casting misstep in trying to replace her. As for the film as a whole it was good, but it didn't make me feel the intense emotions I felt with Director Niels Arden Oplev's vision.<br />For those of you who haven't seen the 2009 Swedish version of not only The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but the rest of the Millennium Series;  The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, do yourself a favor and watch them! I personally don't mind sub-titles and it is well worth every moment.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A 'hard to put down read'!!!  A fantasic story that introduces the taboo in a breath-taking way.  I have to admit I have reread books 1 - 3, and though I know what is coming, the stories still manage to pull me in!
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk by Stephen King is a magnificent tale about one's will to live. The story takes place in an alternate America where 100 teenage boys sign up for \\"The Long Walk\\". The boys have to walk at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, and if they fall bellow, they are warned. 3 warnings and they are removed from the competition. This doesn't mean they are pulled off to the side to watch the rest of the walkers. It means they get a bullet to the head. Although this seems to be a somewhat dull and tedious plot line for a novel, King dives deep into the characters and how they deal with the situation. The way in which King develops the characters you feel like you are right there with them, enduring the same struggle. The horror of the book comes from the reliability, both between the setting and the characters. Even though it takes place in an alternate America the two are not that different. Same with the characters. The boys are just a bunch of normal teenagers. Once the connection to the characters is made, which is pretty quick thanks to King's wonderful writing style, the emotions begin. You feel the same disgust, terror, and realization that the boys do and that is what makes the novel such a wonderful read.<br /><br />  The main theme in The Long Walk is the will to live. How far can you push your body and how long can your mind last when all your friends are dying around you. Just to give a clear understanding, the walkers have to walk nonstop all day and all night. They make friends right away because of the simple fact that going into something as scary and awful as the Long Walk alone would be a complete nightmare. Now imagine the physical pain and exhaustion of walking non-stop for days on end. Try to fathom, if you can, how devastating it would be to watch your friends being shot to death all around you. This is exactly what the walkers had to go through. I feel that King captures the feeling perfectly. The boys all deal with it differently but the imagery brings out your own reaction that may or may not be similar to the walkers'. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. King does an amazing job building up the characters. It is very easy to feel a real personal connection with the characters. Any parts of the story that are left vague are probably done on purpose so that the reader can fill in the blanks with their own imagination. There were a number of times when I found myself needing to take a break from reading so that I could reflect on myself just from the intensity of some of the topics brought up by the walkers and the narrator. Ultimately, a book is supposed to make you think and feel and The Long Walk does this better than almost any other book I have read. This is one of King's best novels and a must read for anyone of any age.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Excellent video. This video is funny and great for the whole family, not just kids. You will enjoy watching this video.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Lots of good reviews here already, so I'll just contribute with another 5 star review, since it is Well deserved.
0345803485|1.0|I couldn't agree more with all of the reviewers who marked this book 1 star. It is trash....I have just skimmed the first few pages on the \\"click to see inside\\" option, and I couldn't help but feel that I have already solved the cliche plot between Ana and Christian. Furthermore, the excessive use of \\"I\\" and the whole \\"double crap\\"part....I do not know how this book became New York Best seller, but I just wanted to strangle Ana...IN JUST THE FIRST FEW PAGES!<br />Please, for the love of God, you do not have to resort to this in order to find good literature. There are a an abundance of novels in this world that will literally \\"sweep you off your feet\\" (if that's what you want)with a brilliant storyline, but this is not one of them. I am glad that I read the reviews, so that I will STEER CLEAR from this book.
B007SGM084|5.0|First, I am annoyed that people are giving the book a bad rating when they haven't read it because they won't pay the price.<br /><br />This series is well worth every penny. This is a well written very intense story about two people (Christian and Anastatia) that are struggling not only with their relationship but their own inner demons. The author makes you feel like you are part of their lives and the involvment of all the other characters in the book make it even better.

B005DOL0R0|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this item, it was not what I was expecting. I thought it woiuld be more like a open and shut cover.  It was probably my own fault, I misunderstood the description.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I bought this and have been &quot;downloading resources&quot; for 3 days now. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times; no good. I am on Kindle Fire. Compatible? Please help. Would really like to enjoy this game. It looks very interesting.......
B0068RHSCW|4.0|Some folks have expressed dismay about a seemingly major plot point being given away in the trailer.  For those who have seen the trailer and know which plot point I'm talking about, I want to let you know that that particular point is revealed in the first half of the film, and is NOT, in my opinion, any kind of major spoiler.  The fact that they chose to put that in the trailer should clue you in to the fact that the movie is really about something else.<br /><br />This is a fine role for Daniel Craig.  He imbues it with conviction and strength.  His chemistry with Rachel Weisz is appealing, his character's frustrations are accessible.  I really enjoyed this film and felt that it expressed some important values about family, friendship, love, forgiveness, and letting go.  Four stars.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|This movie is ok if you are stuck inside on a rainy day with nothing better to do.  The storyline was a little lacking and I did not agree with the ending but of course as we all know, it is all a plot to have a part II.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I purchased this headset in January 2012 because my home office is directly below my kids room and I often work late at night while listening to music or watching netflix.  I was excited about the product as I have enjoyed logitech products for years, and loved the wireless feature as I was coming off a set of Tritton headset where the wires were always getting in the way.<br />Everything was great up until last week when I go to put on my headset, which had seen maybe 10 hours of use since purchased January 10th, and the right muff is dangling from the wires.<br />Now I had read some postings on Logitech's community forums about this exact issue, the critical stress point where the muff joins the headband is secured by a very small(about 1 inch by 1.5 inch trapezoid shaped) and apparently fragile piece of plastic with 4 screw holes.  I am an engineer by education, and although i don't design consumer electronics for a living, even I can tell you that this was a poor design implementation in an otherwise solid headset.  Using even a cheap metal alloy would have made this 500% more durable and added almost nothing to the weight.<br />I call up their warranty claims center and I am fully expecting to get hassled, told that it's not covered under the warranty because I neglected them, etc, etc.  To my amazement I get a friendly rep who takes down my info, has me read some data off the headset, gives me a case number and tells me they will be replaced under the warranty.  Shocked, I get the UPS prepaid label, pack the headset up in a box and ship it off.  He says they will ship me a new set as soon as my old one arrives.<br /><br />Now this makes me think they have a known issue with the headset, which I hope is fixed with my replacement set.  If all goes well i will keep this a 4 star review.  If not I will update and adjust it.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Warranty turn around time was fantastic, shipping is UPS ground, which it slow, overall it will have taken 11 days from the day I shipped the broken ones, 9 of which was transit time.  Will update again later.<br /><br />Update 2:<br />It's now almost 3/4's of a year after Logitech replaces the first pair, and I am revising this to a 4 star rating.  They seem to have fixed the issue with the brittle plastic, but I still treat the things like glass. One issue that comes up is Flash support, and balance in the audio, but can be fixed by rolling back to certain versions of flash.  I use them for business calls all the time using google talk, audio is always clear.  There is a drop out every once in a while, but nothing critical.  Range is ok, but nothing spectacular.  I would love to see these in a universal design so that i could use them with pc/xbox/ps3/any source.  But they are just for pc.  Overall 4 stars because I only paid a hundred for them at a big box store.
B00000J0O2|1.0|Note that the photo used for this product shows HP's most current packaging. The cartridge I received was in older packaging, and the cartridge performed exactly as you'd expect from a five- or more-year-old toner cartridge: printing was very faint and streaked--worse than the output from the nearly depleted cartridge I wanted to replace. The cartridge was unusable, in other words. Note also that nearly all the more recent reviews posted here mention the same problem. Amazon took the cartridge back and refunded my money, but I'm disappointed to see that they continue to sell via this supplier. In my experience, what you see is not what you get. Also, the $126.25 list price given for this cartridge is deceptively inflated--HP itself sells the cartridge for $87.99 with free next day shipping.

B0000261RJ|5.0|DIO create great music on RAINBOW and BLACK SABBATH...and his first 3 solo albuns are classics too!!!!This one, SACRED HEART is magic rock piece!!! Love almost all the songs...it´s a little different from the first 2 DIO albuns, but gems like KING OF ROCK N ROLL, ANOTHER LIE, JUST ANOTHER DAY, LIKE A BEAT OF A HEART and the title track turns SACRED HEART into the third masterpiece from DIO solo career!!!!!WELL DONE, RONNIE!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I downloaded this book based on the reviews ( 4 1/2 stars). After I read it, I was surprised that so many people thought this book was a \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Page Turner\\". I found it to be the complete opposite. It started off well, but then it turned into chapter after chapter of tedious descriptions of characters and also very repetitive on the details of the crime. There were endless chapters of the family meeting with the lawyer,and the psychatrist,and way too may details about the trial.<br /><br />I also, as some reviewers stated, felt that the main character seemed a little niave. He was a DA for many years and yet he was totally oblivious when it came to his family. I painfully pushed through this book hoping that the \\"Twist at the end\\" (as some reviewers promised), would make the long journey to the end worth while. I did not find the ending a surprise at all. It seemed somewhat obvious once I got down to the last few chapters.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book based on the potential story line, and was left completely disappointed.
B00005K9LK|5.0|WOW! In my opinion, this is the best moment on PRIEST´s career!!!! BLOODSTONE, ANOTHER THING COMING, ELETRIC EYe, RIDING ON THE WIND...GREAT HEAVY ROCK ALBUM!!!!

B0002XMF5S|3.0|Seventh Star got some good songs like TURN INTO STONE, HEART LIKE A WHEEL and ANGRY HEART, but it´s really not a SABBATH album...It´s not an solo IOMMI album, either...Maybe a Glenn Hughes project, but it´s a strange unique album with the legendary SABBATH name on it...And it´s BY FAR the MOST POP moment of all IOMMI career...It´s not a bad album, but SEVENTH STAR is not a SABBATH album...it sounds like a good rock pop band from the 80´s...
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I'm already liking it more than anything I've ever heard from her. Sounds like she's changed her style quite a bit... people hate to see artist's change, but I love it because it means they're not a one trick pony...
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|BURN, Coverdale´s debut on Purple is a good rock piece with the classic title track, MIGHT JUST TAKE YOUR LIFE, SAIL AWAY and MISTREATED...i really prefer IAN GILLAN as Purple´s voice, but BURN got many great moments!!!
B0015DROBO|1.0|After all the media hype and the release of the American movie, I felt that I was compelled to join the 21st century and read this book that the entire world was raving about. I'm about a third of the way through it and it is a snooze-fest at best. Being the avid reader that I am, I didn't even consider the abridged version. Now I wish I had--at least it would shorten my misery. I will keep reading hoping to discover what is so all fired wonderful. However, at this point it would take something pretty miraculous to even get my attention. I really hate that I wasted one of my Audible credits on this piece of junk...just glad that I didn't buy the trilogy. I definitely will NOT be reading the other two. Probably sounds cruel to say, but I figured the author died of boredom after writing these books.
B00005K9LN|5.0|This must be the most well know Priest album, with 2 all time metal hits BREAKING THE LAW and METAL GODS!!!!That's the point where Priest become a metal icon and create ground for SLAYER and IRON MAIDEN to grow!!!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|the girls at work were raving about this book. now ive read some heavy smut stuff before but they were not raved about like this. so i decided to download it. worse idea ever. i agree with some of the other reviews - its like its trying to be a twilight porn. the mysterious good looking guy and the uncoordinated innocent girl. the writing is childish and the context is kinda disturbing. i lovee to read and have a broad range of reading interests but i could not finish this book. and that is a first for me. dont do it. whatever u do just dont put yourself through the torture. its not worth the time
B000068R1X|3.0|BARK AT THE MOON got some great OZZY songs like CENTRE OF ETERNITY, NOW YOU SEE IT and the classic title track...but the rest of songs are not so inspired...not one of the best moments from OZZY....

B00723NWJE|5.0|Obviously she went through a tough breakup before making this album.  It seems she's stepping further out of her comfort zone and becoming more brazen and adventurous as a songwriter and singer.  If some retards don't like that and would prefer someone to make the same album 20 times over, then I recommend trying AC/DC.  Any open-minded music fan will find this album fun, yet relaxing to listen to, which is what Norah's voice was intended for.  Not quite as good as 'The Fall', but still very enjoyable.  Just one problem concerning the vinyl edition.  Who's the idiot that decided to put this 45 minute album on two records?  Are they 78's?  They better be.  YOU CAN FIT UP TO 30 MINUTES PER SIDE ON AN LP!!!!!!  ALSO, ANY COLOR OF VINYL OTHER THAN BLACK LOOKS VERY TACKY.  GLAD I BOUGHT THE CD.
044024630X|1.0|I've read a couple of Jack Reacher novels in the past, and found them wanting. I bit on this one because of the many good review snippets printed in the paperback, saying this was one of his best. I guess so, if you like all of your good guys very tall and arrogant and opinionated and you like to hear all of your characters speak in the same voice (women, dirtbags, they all sound the same) and you like a thick pane of glass between the main character and the reader, and between the author and the book. It reads like it was written by a poorly-programmed computer. We knew who did it in the first quarter of the book, and that the killer did it just because he/she could (trying to not give away anything here). We didn't learn anything in the succeeding pages. Why is anyone attracted to the gratuitous violence in these novels? And for those of you who are, why do you put up with 500 pages of cheesburgers and pie slices and trees and the midnight train to get to it?
0741470314|5.0|A well researched book which is a joy to read. Dr. Moriarty has created a portrait of Michael Jackson which reveals a man of great depth, compassion and understanding. This portrait is far different than that painted by the mass media. Dr. Moriarty's picture is truer and much more interesting.
B005LAIGPA|3.0|This review contains MILD spoilers. No names are mentioned, but astute readers won't find it hard to figure out who I'm talking about. Normally I avoid writing spoilers as much as I can, but I have found that, no matter how I phrase this review, it's still pretty obvious. I believe that is due less to my failings as a writer, and more to the failings of the movie's script. Even this website's staff review pretty much gives it away. Still, for those of you who are devout haters of spoilers, STOP READING NOW.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />CHRONICLE is one of those films that is annoyingly close to being really, really good. The story concerns three high school seniors -- Andrew, Matt, and Steve. Andrew's mother is dying of lung cancer and his father is an abusive alcoholic. Andrew himself is your typical put-upon loser, the kind of skinny, whiny-voiced kid who seems to have forgotten to go through puberty. Although his family circumstances obviously make him a sympathetic character, it is not hard to see why he is so relentlessly bullied and teased at school. He's mopey, cowardly, isolated, and he carries a freaking camera around with him wherever he goes. Even to a rave.<br /><br />Then, lo and behold, the boys stumble across a strange hole in the ground, inside of which is some kind of mysterious glowing force that emits sounds like feedback from a speaker the size of a bus. The boys investigate (natch) and then, whatdoyaknow, they find that they have developed super powers from the strange object (which conveniently disappears for the rest of the film).<br /><br />The remainder of the story deals with the guys coming to terms with their new abilities (they don't seem particularly fazed by it) and learning how to use them. From here on out, the movie -- desperate for a villain -- takes the story down very predictable avenues. It turns out that having too much power can corrupt you (I'm surprised no one's ever realized this before), and before long, it's a battle royale to determine who will be the top dog of their little triumvirate.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic. They are nearly seamless, which helps detract from the fact that this is a \\"found footage\\" movie. These types of movies use the \\"found footage\\" conceit to enhance the realism of the film, but in a case like this, it mostly just detracts from the story. What does it say about a movie that it is much easier to believe that a character can fly or move things with his mind than it is to believe that he carries a running camera with him every single solitary place he goes? Even up in the clouds, at night, during a thunderstorm, while he cries alone because he puked beer on a girl that wanted to sleep with him. He even carries it to a funeral, for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Near the end, when the film shifts back and forth between security cameras, news footage, and phone cameras, the \\"found footage\\" aspect becomes, ironically, less intrusive. At least, it seems more plausible. However, by then, the movie has devolved into a standard superhero showdown. Throughout the film, there are multiple references to philosophers and their beliefs on human nature, desire, or reality. It leads viewers to believe that there might be some kind of deeper theory driving the story, that there might be an allegory here for something grander and more interesting than teenagers playing football in the stratosphere. But, no. It seems as if the whole thing is basically about how much it sucks to be bullied by classmates and drunk dads.<br /><br />Even that wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't foolishly conclude with a complete logical back-flip. The movie's message -- perhaps muddied by its need for a clear-cut antagonist and conflict -- is literally told to the audience by a character who reminds us that, while the villain killed many people and endangered the lives of countless others in a blind fit of petulant rage, he was still basically a good guy at heart.<br /><br />Wrong, movie. You can't have it both ways, at least not with a story that lacks as much meat as this one. Because the characters are so one-dimensional, the movie only works on a chewy, eye-candy level, but it desperately wants to make a watered-down point about Nature vs. Nurture, or perhaps the psychology of prepubescence. Either way, it comes across as half-baked, heavy-handed, and actually pretty ridiculous. And that's saying a lot for a film where teens use superpowers to scare little girls at toy stores.<br /><br />Watch it for the special effects, but be prepared to be steadily annoyed by Andrew's nails-on-a-chalkboard voice and the rather quick-and-easy slide the movie takes from \\"Gee, these powers are awesome\\" to \\"The world must burn!\\"e was still basically a good guy at heart.<br /><br />Wrong, movie.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must say what many others have already said about this book. It was fantastic. Each part flows seamlessly to the next. The story offered alot of intrigue and surprise and as I read it I felt that I was right there in that world. I want to thank you Hugh for such a great book and I hope you do continue to write more about this world. I would also like to say that I thought the Q & A section at the end was awesome.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Overall it's nice, but you can't close the app. The app will always be running. it will even start back up without opening it after you Stop the app when viewing the running apps. I love the idea of this app, but it drains my battery since it's running all day long. I'd give this 5 stars for an app in itself, but I don't trust any app that runs all the time even when you force a close.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ignore the hype about the \\"porn\\" in this book (and the other two), this is young adult escapism at its best.  The wit and humor of the author shows through all of the \\"under (and over) the sheets\\" antics of the characters.  It is true that Christian and Ana get up to a lot more kinky sex than is to the taste of most of us over 65, but the dialogue and repartee are worth the read.  I especially l liked the emails...but you have to connect the subject and signature blocks, not to mention the timing, to really appreciate what is happening.  For  some, it might pay to keep a dictionary and thesaurus handy.

B002XTXG1G|4.0|... as an art form, the editing, direction, and overall feel of the movie is perfect. Kubrick would have been proud to make this movie. There is a surreal feeling that permeates throughout which, is indicative of the world that Charlie Bronson lives in.<br /><br />This movie is a narrative of a sad figure, Michael Peterson who wants nothing more than to be famous ... for something. He \\"Can't sing, can't act\\" so, in his words, he's short of options. A bungled armed robbery puts him away for seven years that become decades due to his desire to be famous. That fame, manifests itself as his desire to be Britain's most violent criminal. So violent that he spends 30+ years of his term in solitary due to hostage taking, constant attacks of staff and inmates and rioting.<br /><br />Changing his name to Charlie Bronson, after the film star, Peterson's surreal world is understood only by him. Those who try to peel away any of his layers feel his wrath. To say Peterson is his own worst enemy is to misunderstand him. Peterson, defines himself by his ability to strike fear into anyone, friend or foe. The system is not his enemy, the system is what allows him to be famous. The system enables him.<br /><br />Watch the movie with an open mind. It's art is its strength, the subject is secondary. The soundtrack is excellent and parallels with Kubrick's works will be drawn.<br /><br />Personally, I loved the flick and, it led me to do a little more research on the subject.<br /><br />Enjoy it for what it is, a surreal flick about a surreal person.

0756407125|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss is undoubtedly one of the most skilled and imaginative writers in all of science fiction/fantasy. I really enjoyed this book. It is impossible not to become incredibly fond of Kvothe. Rothfuss instills in the reader a deep admiration for him. From deeply saddening, to wildly exciting, this book will take you on an emotional roller-coaster. The main plot partitions can seem to be a little drawn out near the end of each, but I was sincerely captivated by all of them. The only reason I did not give it five stars is this: even though the book was well-written and highly entertaining, it still is but a shadow of the first book in terms of sheer perfection. The Name of the Wind, for me, is the epitome of fantasy novel perfection. Although I can't necessarily rank them in order, The Name of the Wind will forever be in my top 3 favorite novels. Rothfuss will really need to pull through in the third book if he wants to claim my personal title of the greatest fantasy trillogy ever written.<br /><br />But seriously, buy a copy and read it. You don't want to miss any of the story before the third book comes out!
B0035JNTA6|5.0|We love Ben Stiller. We are fans of most of his movies. He just cracks us up! We recommend this movie.
0765365278|5.0|Deftly written and highly entertaining. Couldn't put it down. Brandon Sanderson has truly created a masterpiece in The Way of Kings
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like this so much better than Oregon settlers. movie theater with short and minigame are great touches! no energy limit. pretty easy to get a little of the cash-money without spending real money.<br />you can get to the nag bar by through the stuff menu, then options (the gears at the bottom). Not a bug. Works great!
0756405890|5.0|I have read more science-fiction/fantasy books than I can count, but I must tell you - there very few authors out there that can weave a story like Patrick Rothfuss, regardless of genre. \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" is truly a captivating story. The characters are developed in such vivid detail, that by the end of the book, you feel devoted to them as if you know them in person. The magic system, though unconventional, just makes sense as though it flows naturally from the novel. I love how the author really makes Kvothe, the main character, strive painstakingly for all his accomplishments...and as I read, I feel as if I am right there along with him. I found myself longing for more as soon as I read the last page!!!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This cover is clearly made for the Fire. It is simple and intuitive.  It fits well and performs as advertised but is pricey for what it is.  Shipped on time, received on time and functions as promised.  I didn't shop around but I am guessing there are equally good covers for a lot less money.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|I am pleasantly surprised that Game of Thrones was able to live up to the source material, especially considering the number of characters and plot lines that populate this incredibly dense story.<br /><br />On the plus, the show does an amazing job of casting. The acting is spot on and the essence of each character is captured. The cinematography is also very good. Each of the places \\"feels\\" right, from the bleak cold of the Northern Wall to the dirty opulence of Kings Landing. It is a joy to watch.<br /><br />On the negative, it's just not possible to properly tell this story in 10 hours. The show is dialogue-driven, which causes a lot of context to slip through the cracks. If you have not read the book, be prepared to be a bit lost in the first four episodes. The show does not find its stride until around Episode 5, so please press on if you find yourself a bit lost or bored.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy to have this in my permanent collection. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show and fully expect to rewatch it several times in the future.
B006VR65OQ|4.0|Good film for sport buffs.  Very entertaining and actually informative on how some things work in the world of sports business.  Brad Pitt did a very good job in taking a behind the scenes role and making it come alive.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is so much fun and very very addictive! Great controls...beautiful graphics. Each wave of zombies is harder and harder but good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a fun and brain game it uses your brain so much. the best kindle fire game ever.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is an enjoyable game and the price is right. The cards could be a smidgen bigger. They should create team solitary so you wouldn't have to play alone
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Honestly- I have never been so disappointed in myself for spending a dollar. you're better off using the free app. I saw this recommendation in other reviews but foolishly purchased this anyway. all I wanted to do was enjoy the multiplayer option. despite the fact that my Internet connection works for all my other apps- I have not been able to play multiplayer because the &quot;network connection failed&quot;. altogether- just spend your dollar on a book or donate to a charity- because buying this app is a waste of time and money.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I must have bought this game on every platform...lol...good app runs great. it didn't work on my old phone so I have updated my review to reflect its better performance on my new phone. galaxy nexus
B0076NAWWA|2.0|I bought this without hearing any clips.  Relying on glowing reviews, with this line up of killer musicians, surely this would be an exciting album, right?  On my first listen I felt ill.  This sounded nothing like anything these musicians have done previously.  I didn't want a Dregs-Theater-Trans-Beard sounding album.  I wanted something different, creative, and inspiring.  It is different... this is a bland pop/rock album, not the type of music I would label as creative and inspiring.  If you like Coldplay or Muse this could be worth a listen.<br /><br />So then I tried to listen to this as though it was a new band that I had no previous experience with.  That didn't help.  This is not the type of music I enjoy.  The playing is good but the music is weak and the hooks are cheesy.  The instrumental section of \\"Infinite Fire\\" is awesome, but when the vocals come back in the tune sinks.  I hear very little influence from Steve or Dave and think they were just doing what Mike and the producer told them to play.  What a shame and a wasted opportunity.  To me this project feels rushed, even the final mix sounds harsh.<br /><br />There have been some great supergroup projects - UK, The Aristocrats, Frost*, and Transatlantic.  This project could have been better if it wasn't the MP solo album and more color was input from the other musicians.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's amazing that this game is free as its quality is superior to many that you pay for.  There's a wealth of fine detail in the graphics, and the gameplay quickly becomes challenging and intense.  While you do not craft the Samurai's attacks, you choose when he attacks or retreats, and what equipment, powers, and allies he deploys; strategy matters.--An excellent diversion!
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|This is one of the best CD`s I have ever bought and I bought it the first day it was released. Steve Morse is one of the best guitarists ever, Dave LaRue is one of the best bass players ever and Mike Portnoy is one of the best drummers ever. Casey McPherson has a great voice and Neal Morse and Mike Portnoy do excellent backing vocals and harmonizing, they did a great job blending their voices. The melodies are great and these guys are very professional. These guys are amazing to be able to put out an awesome CD like this in such a short period of time because these guys are very busy with other projects.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|liked the free but ads were irritating so paid for the sd free.  worked less than a week.  won't let me log in. goes to a screen asking for login and keeps saying password is incorrect.  is not!  also switches my english screen to indonesian language!  in random play got stuck with someone who wanted to write clues and i can't delete him.  not very functional game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried (and tossed) three different weather apps before AccuWeather. This app has the easiest interface working from my Kindle, and it's kinda  fun to use
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game I cant stop playing it its so addicting its so simple but amazing :))))  you all should play!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this game just browsing one day and I love it. easy to play my 8 year old can even play this game! good game and it is free!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like this game, because you don't have to spend money to have fun. Plus the kids really like it.<br /><br />**Update: I haven't experienced this myself, but you have to configure a lock on in game buying! My friend told me that she found that her son had bought $100 worth of acorns! I have a setting on my kindle that requires you to enter a passcode in order to make purchases, so I never had this problem.
B005HSL626|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game! It works well on the Kindle Fire! So far no bugs or any freezing.
B007712XAU|5.0|i loved downton abbey and am looking forward to season 3,it was an interesting film and kept my attention.i hated when it ended.i would like information on the next season.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|the app keeps interrupting wanting me to rate it so i am writing to stop it asking, thus four instead of five stars<br /><br />also, why no exit button? (like so many android apps)
0439023513|2.0|Though the series in it's entirety wasn't bad, I was extremely bothered that it was told from the perspective of one person. I felt as though it would have been beneficial to see the perspective of the second and third books change as I don't really think the best story is a flat view from Katniss Everdeen. In fact, she barely changes at all throughout the series, which is frustrating. I would have liked to see the second book from the other survivor of the games, Peeta. Or, Prim. Or Gale. Anybody except just the one dimensional view of this main character who barely has any redeeming qualities, any understanding of her own emotions (that doesn't change by the end of the series), or any understanding of the world. She acts on instinct rather than finding out facts. The most disappointing was this book because we could have seen an expansive view had we followed President Coin or President Snow. Could you imagine the story as told through Snow's eyes? In fact, half the book could have been dedicated to his rise to power, a closer look at life in the Capitol city.<br /><br />But, no, we receive a flat view of Katniss Everdeen, with little to no development. She's like the albatross of the story: dead, boring, with little to no personality who never really understands anything and gets an epilogue with babies in a romantic, hollywood ending. The only reason why I didn't give it one star is because she actually allowed herself the awareness to realize that she had human feelings that weren't flat with barely, at least, SOME introspection.<br /><br />You have a good story, Suzanne Collins, but you just didn't let it grow.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I don't normally rate puzzle games but this one is worth checking out. Great for playing on the tarmac like Alec.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|A great rendition of spy games.  True to life with enough action to keep you interested to the last gasp.  A thinking man's movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awsome book I couldn't put it down immediately bought the third one and started reading it I definitely recommend it
1594481717|4.0|There are some predictable naysayers in this review section, but then, \\"Angry Critic Guy\\" is nothing new to Amazon. He or she loves to play \\"Holy Mackerel, the extent to which I am smarter than the morons writing books is staggering.\\"  We all know That Guy.<br /><br />Interesting ideas in the book. If somebody was looking to have the current state of the unverse explained in a couple hundred pages, with thorough \\"evidence\\" (ah, the crap that passes for evidence these days...), then hanging out at the bookshop in O'Hare probably ain't where you want to be.<br /><br />If the general premise interests you, read it. You can take what seems valuable, and leave what seems less so. Simple. We find inner resonance with books/ideas/thoughts/poems/ or we do not. I do not need Pink's evidence to know whether my inner knower finds the ideas worth reflecting upon.<br /><br />I can't believe I let myself read some of the thread of the guys who use the statistically REALLY small number of bashers as an excuse to \\"avoid this one\\"....You could PROBABLY avoid reading anything, ever, by that line of reasoning. Some people think \\"Hamlet\\" sucked. \\"THANKS!  I WILL AVOID THAT ONE !!\\" Shakespeare offered not a scintilla of evidence !!
B005LAIGTG|4.0|This such a wonderful and cute movie! Romantic Comedy/ Drama/ Funny/ Twists.... this film has a bit of it all. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum really click in this film and since it's based on a true story, they both make it seem so real and believable. Their characters are so likeable and they are great in this one. I don't want to ruin this for those who have yet to see it but all I will say is if you like romantic comedies/ dramas/ funny/ and movies with twists, you will like this one =)
0316017930|4.0|Are all of Gladwell's hypotheses accurate and thoroughly evidence based? I don't care. It is really interesting and made me think a whole lot. Reminded me of James Hillman's \\"Acorn Theory\\", where he offers an alternative paradigm to the culturally prevalent one, and says \\"WHAT IF it's not like that? WHAT IF it's like THIS?\\" and the WHAT IF leads you on a great white water rafting trip thorugh Class V inner inquiry, and when a book can do that, I am a happy guy. I am not looking for \\"truth\\", much less \\"evidence-based\\" truth. I am looking for interesting and innovative thinking that can get my own Inner Knower interested in doing his own inquiry.<br /><br />Those of you looking to these Airport Reads for truth are probably looking for your lost quarter not on the street where you lost it, but on the street that offers more light....Good luck....

B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game froze up my Kindle.  After reading several other reveiws who experienced the same problem, I was able to get back to the home screen and immediately delete it!  Not worth the trouble.

B000VSAEYI|4.0|I bought this for my 18m old nephew. Before we could get it unfold he was squealing and wanting to get in it. To inflate, omg! There are so many valves, that must be CLOSED to start. Typically one valve, you would think inflates one section, nope not in this case. It took about 1 hr to inflate using a small battery power air compressor. Even though the deminisions are given it seemed alot bigger than what I imagined. He absolutley loved it. The extra inflatables are big and really cute, especially the turtle that has balls w/ bells in it. I was a little worried about the pool behind the slide being deep, but there's an overflow port that drains the water if it gets too high. Which in a way doesn't allow much water. If you have an older child I guess you could tape the hole to allow more water, but I left it opened til he gets a little older. Also, left opened b/c when he climbs over the side to get in he did fumbled once and went head first into the lil pool. But he is a child that loves water in his face.<br />The slide is awesome, he loved sliding down head first. Some other reviews stated kids can't slide down easy. Part is true. He is still in diapers so the lil swimmer pull ups didn't allow him to slide easy, and if the water is not on to lube the slide it is a little rough to slide also. But that really didn't bother him, he scooted down anyway. He weighs about 25-30 lbs and the slide does hold him.<br />The hose hooks to a valve that does have a shut off which is nice. There are little holes thru out the whole thing that allows the water to \\"sprinkle\\" out. If the valve is opened all the way and the hose is opened all the way water really squirts out. This shocked me and scared him. Water was really squirting high, so I suggest not turning the water on all the way or opening the valve all way.<br />The bigger part doesn't hold alot of water either, which is perfect for him. He likes to lay on his stomache and kick his feet like his swimming.<br />I'm so glad Igot this for him. It might not last til next year, some reviews complain about leaks, but it is an inflatable. What can you expect for $30. In my eyes, after watching him that one day in it, I've already got my moneys worth!!<br /><br />UPDATE: My nephew stills loves it and is in it everyday. HOWEVER, will not stay inflated.very disappointed in that. very hard to find if it's a hole or leaking from valve, (too many valves). i can't see it lasting 2 summers, but I still feel it was worth it for the price.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just finished reading the 50 Shades of Grey Triology for the SECOND time and truely enjoyed them. The writing is not going to win any awards but this reading is for enjoyment!  I read thru the books quickly the first time wanting to know how the story plot would turn out.  Reading thru them again I found more suttle details about how Christian has evolved since meeting Ana.<br /><br />Most women read these romance novels to escape the everyday we call life to add a little spice into their lives, this is a good set of books to accomplish just that.
B007Q476KU|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, I found it to be very disappointing. I am a horse lover and trainer...this movie anthopomorphizes human feelings and thoughts onto the horse in a blatant manner. It was so unrealistic that I couldn't even watch it.
0399159029|5.0|Prague Fatale has everything I have always loved in a Bernie Gunther novel: the world-weary protagonist and his razor-sharp wit, a well crafted portrait of Germany under the Nazis, and a well-laid-out whodunnit.<br /><br />Unlike some, I have still enjoyed Bernie's post-war adventures, though he is at his best when walking the fine moral line that separates him from the Nazis. This is as good as any of the three Berlin Noir trilogy novels, and well worth a read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|download it &amp; start having fun! !!! highly reccommended! !!!  challenges your brain power and strengthens the most important muscle in your bod! !! your brain silly! !!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this fast read.  I highly suggest this book if you are looking for a summer read that is in a series.  All of the books are a quick read that keeps you interested.  They are really hard to put down.
B003NHRIVQ|2.0|I found it boring, predictable and I have to be honest: I'm writing this review even though I didn't watch the end; I simply lost interest halfway through the movie and switched to Warner Channel.<br /><br />I liked Greg Kinnear's performance (Ronnie's father) but I absolutely hated Miley Cyrus as Ronnie. I'm aware that according to the plot Ronnie has to be a bitch at the beginning, but Miley Cyrus just ruined it for me. What's up with her teeth anyways!<br /><br />That said, I already read what the ending is about, the plot is not that bad, I wonder if the book is any good, I simply regret watching the movie (well, half of it)
B0079J26TI|2.0|Here is the latest offering from the troubled classical music industry - from EMI, no less. What we have here is a series of \\"brand-new\\" SACDs selling \\"AS IS\\".

068987474X|5.0|This is the book I have been waiting for all my life. It has helped me found the right guy for myself. Basically if your guys doesn't do certain criteria's of what the book says (meaning the good or the bad)&#34;he's just not that into you.&#34; Trust me once you start reading this book you wouldn't want to put it down because you will begin to see a pattern in your past or current relationships and hopefully you can learn from your mistakes and find the man that makes you the exception.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Paul Simon is a poet and speaks to the hearts of all who listen to his music. Especially those of us who are of a similar age as he.  He displays constant growth and is so insightful with his words.... and the music still rocks on.  I would recommend this new music and have done so.

B005DMNS4A|1.0|A friend of mine let me hear this new version of \\"Quadraphenia\\" about a week ago, and all I can say is \\"THANK GOD I KEPT MY MFSL GOLD DISCS! That version is the only way you're gonna be able to hear the origional vinyl mix of this truely incredible album! This latest reissue of \\"Quadraphenia\\" is exactly the same as the 1996 version, with the addition of twelve Pete Townshend demos. While the demos are slightly interesting, you'll probably only listen to them once or twice. The origional vinyl/MFSL version of \\"Quadraphenia\\" is complete, while this and the 1996 editions are missing vocals and sound effects that any self-respecting fan of this classic album will notice right away. In short, if you're someone who remembers the origional version, and didn't like what was done to the album in 96 than save your money and track down the MFSL edition. TRUST ME, it's worth it, and if you look long enough and hard enough you'll find a copy for a farely reasonable price. GOOD LUCK, and if enough of us true Who fans stear clear of this piece of junk maybe the record company will get the message and do a proper remaster in the future. HTH PS If you're wondering about the \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" and weather you should get that one instead of the 2-disc edition I'll let you know right now DON'T BOTHER! You'll still be getting the 1996 remixed version and some more of pete Townshend's demos, along with a DVD containing only eight songs from the album in 5.1 surround sound, as well as a big book with alot of stuff that IN_MY_NEVER_TO_BE_HUMBELD_OPINION aren't worth the rediculous price of this paticular edition! So once again folks, if you're thinkin' about upgrading your existing copy of \\"Quadraphenia\\" DON'T! You'll only be wasting your time and money, and Lord knows there's precious little of that to go around as it is. Oh yeah, and Pete Townshend and Roger Daltry don't need any more of your hard earn cash!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I got my watch for Christmas and have been using it a little over 5 months now, and I'm as impressed with it as a I was when the box first arrived at my doorstep.  It's pretty easy to get set up and start using it right out of the box, but if you take the time to learn some of the more advanced features you'll find it rewarding.  The virtual partner is a great tool for races and tempo runs as you can easily see in distance and time how far ahead of/behind your goal pace you are.  And speed work exercises are easy with the interval training feature-you want to do 8 400 meter (quarter mile) reps with 45 second rest intervals in between, with a warmup and cooldown period?  Just program it before you leave the house and the watch will beep to tell you when to go to the next rep.  Much better than bringing a list and having to check it, and manually checking the watch to see when you've finished a rep.  The data upload is seamless and really gives great feedback in a highly usable and understandable format.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I've never had any issues with the bezel and sweat, and I run outdoors in Texas and have worn it in a rainstorm.  I have small wrists and the original band was too big for me but I swapped it out for one of the included velcro cloth bands and it fits comfortably now.  It's not a small watch, but even on my hand it's not uncomfortable and it's easy to forget I'm wearing it.<br /><br />Overall, I've been very satisfied with this watch and highly, highly recommend it.

B000002LLC|4.0|Madonna as torch singer: still seems a little implausible over 20 years later, but \\"I'm Breathless: Music From and Inspired by the Film 'Dick Tracy'\\" has actually aged pretty well--actually not at all considering the built-in retro factor it already had back in 1990. Ironically, \\"Vogue\\" sounds the most dated of everything here.<br /><br />Granted, anyone who hates show tunes will likely despise this, as will those who refuse to accept Madonna as anything but Queen of the Dance Floor, but \\"I'm Breathless\\" is much better than I remember it. While the low points are an embarassingly silly Carmen Miranda take-off called \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" and dull duet with Mandy Patinkin \\"What Can You Lose\\", there are some excellent numbers in the steamy opener \\"He's a Man\\"; 1940's Broadway-styled \\"More\\"; the sophisticated \\"Back in Business\\" employs the same airy vocals and finger-snaps Madonna would put to good use on her upcoming cover of \\"Fever\\"; she takes us from swing to New-Jack Swing in \\"Now I'm Following You\\". The needlessly controversial ode to spanking \\"Hanky Panky\\" is harmless fun; and the role-call of silver-screen legends over the nimble house beats of \\"Vogue\\" remains to me the pinnacle of her illustrious career.<br /><br />He's a Man 5/5<br />Sooner or Later 4/5<br />Hanky Panky 5/5<br />I'm Going Bananas 1/5<br />Cry Baby 4/5<br />Something to Remember 4/5<br />Back In Business 5/5<br />More 4/5<br />What Can You Lose 1/5<br />Now I'm Following You 4/5<br />Vogue 5/5<br /><br />If you dismissed this album in the '90s, it's definitely worth revisiting through grown-up ears.

B005FITIK0|4.0|It amazed me to see so many 1-star reviews for this film, so I thought I'd offer my two cents worth. \\"Young Adult\\" is not a rom-com. It's a cruel dark look at the life of an emotionally fractured person (Charlize Theron) who thought she had it all figured out in high school, only to be confronted with real life after graduation. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but I will mention how heartbreaking it is to watch a person struggle beyond her means to even comfort herself. There is no transformation, no salvation, things do not get better. It is not hopeful, and does not pretend to leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Letting you off the hook at the end would insult the viewers as much as it would insult the honesty of the form in which the characters were written.<br /><br />If you want to be entertained, anything Jennifer Anniston has produced would be able to amuse you without altering your sensibilities. However, if you want to see what happened to the prom queen and are prepared to watch a film that has the potential for testing your emotional response, you've come to the right place.<br /><br />Bottom line: This film is unconventional and defies strict genre classification; it is not just a `black comedy', it is a `black comedy spending the holidays alone'. Having stated that, no film-lover should miss the performance Theron delivers, as well as the supporting cast - Patrick Wilson & Patton Oswalt.
B0076UXKDG|2.0|I shoot exclusively with Nikon equipment.  I am certainly not cheap, possessing the D300, D700 and D800 along with an assortment of Nikkor pro lenses.  They are all superb products.  I have no doubt that this new battery grip for the D800 is a fine accessory as well, however, IMO, it is grossly overpriced and I am certainly going to wait for either the price to come down to a more reasonable level or purchase an alternative.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Colin Firth is absolutely brilliant.  He portrays the King of England as a person with a severe speech disability, but who manages to retain a clever sense of humor!  Some scenes were heartbreaking, when the King was trying to speak professionally, and was having such a terrible time.  I could feel the anguish he felt.  Other scenes were so humorous, I nearly died laughing!  Sorry, there are no scenes of casual sex, or high speed chases, where large items are blown apart.  This is a movie that will be enjoyed by persons who appreciate great art.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Clearly this is a fantastic spoof of the very highest quality.  The movie has outstanding acting, excellent special effects, great costumes, and manages the impossible of making the audience buy into these super heroes.  Just to insure the audience gets that this is a spoof of all the over the top action movies out there, the real star is 11-year-old Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl.<br /><br />While all the acting is first rate, Chloe turns in an absolutely brilliant performance blowing away, slicing and dicing more \\"bad guys\\" in one movie than occurs any three kung fu movies.  What's more it is done is such a brilliant manner the audience is able to suspend disbelief and enjoy the movie on several levels.<br /><br />It is bloody, violent, vulgar, cute, funny and absolutely deserves 5 stars out of 5.  I think that you can expect to see a lot more from Miss Chloe Moretz, without whom I doubt this movie would rate 3 stars.  She is the movie, with a fine cast of supporting actors providing just the right support.  It may be Nicholas Cage who gets top billing, but make no mistake this is a Chloe Moretz's movie.
B0077Q30NO|5.0|Myléne Farmer is probably one of the best known and most acclaimed French singers. She has a distinct style and she writes most of her lyrics, and she has one heavenly voice.<br /><br />This collection contains almost all of my favorite songs from her. I did not really want to buy her entire discography and there were only a couple of songs that I wanted from two of her albums, this collection has those. I really enjoy listening to all those songs and listen to her genius. I recommend it if you are into good music in general.
0439023521|4.0|This was an excellent book.  It doesn't have the body of the Harry Potter series but so far it reads pretty good.  I finished it in a couple of days and I did enjoy it.  I'm not sure that what could have been done to make it any better.  I like the premise behind it and I will be purchasing the rest of the series to read.
0385534639|5.0|This book if fantastic, I couldn't put it down. I even gave my best friend a copy for her<br />birthday. If you like magic, adventure and romance this is the book for you! I can't<br />wait for this author to write more books especially if her first one was this good.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have been checking prices for Tamrac backpacks for 4 months trying to justify the high price.  I happened upon this one from Amazon and read the reviews.  I knew I could return it if I was dissatified so I ordered it for my Nikon D200.  I had room for my base and all my attachments including 2 additional lens with room to spare.  Very satisfied with the quality and will definately keep it.  I highly recommend this if you are not willing to pay for the Tamrac name.  In my opinion it is very comparable.
1451648537|5.0|This book is a must-read for everyone, not just the apple-fans or the techy guys. Everyone with some interests in management and the creation of a great, if not the greatest, company must read it.<br />The details provided about the product perception make it useful not to people in product development but working in all sectors of a company.<br />It certainly heavy (with 600+ pages) but worth the time to read it...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wonderful, fast read. Stayed up waaaay too late to finish this book because I couldn't put it down. Now on to book two.

0345803485|5.0|I rarely read books now a days and when I do they're mostly non fiction.  Most other books bore me to tears but this book was so interesting I flew through it in three days.  It took me another three days to get through Darker and now I'm working on Freed.  Love this trilogy.  Wish there was another one like it!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. Its easy to use and since i bring my kindle fire with me everywhere, I can read the bible almost anywhere. Almost. For me, there are 2 simple problems sith this app. First, you need wi-fi to fun it. That can be a little annoying. And second, this app is ALWAYS running. I can't figure out how to furn this app off, even in the settings. But overall, this is a great app.
B007BRJYF2|3.0|Its fun but it has some bugs to work out. every so often it will freeze nd I cant move. so it is disappointing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series.  Yes, some parts were shocking, some made me blush and some made me squirm.  Some things I would not have ever thought of doing but there were a few things that after 15 years of marriage and 3 kids, might add a little spice to our life. Enjoyed the characters and all the \\"quirks\\".

B000X2H8G4|4.0|This is the second Sonic Super Ear I've purchased.  I bought the first for my blind, hearing impaired father over a year ago.  He finds regular hearing aids uncomfortable and I have purchased many different amplifiers over the years.  The \\"pocket talker\\" was very expensive and stopped working after a short time.  The inexpensive over-ear amplifiers were flimsy and difficult for him to keep on.  The Sonic Super Ear has worked perfectly.  The microphone is light weight and easy to hold but can also sit upright on a flat surface.  Now when Dad visits his doctor, the doctor places the microphone on his desk and they can have a normal conversation.  This has improved the quality of his care enormously.<br />So why only four stars?  The headphones.  While they are light weight, they aren't that sturdy and tend to slip.  In addition the ear pads are smaller and it is difficult for him to place for optimum sound quality.  He likes the replacement I got better  [[ASIN:B003LPTAYI Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)]]<br /><br />The first SSE I purchased still works great.  This purchase was a gift for the nurses at Dad's care facility. We overheard them raving about how great this was and how useful it would be for other patients.

B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This book is a narrative restatement of the Acemoglu & Robinson's previous work on the dynamics of transitions to democracy.  While those are somewhat tedious in their math, this one is almost the opposite in running away from math and resorting to narratives to persuade.<br /><br />Well, it could have done with a good trim and the removal of some repetition.  Maybe group the book by region rather than by thesis since some regions tend to come up several times to make different points.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a great book.  Great, as in one everyone should read.  It really will give you a different way of thinking about politics, economics, and history.  Instead of slicing along the traditional (and broken) left vs. right views of history they introduce the dimensions of extractive vs. inclusive to explain why systems fail or improve.  And it does look like the idea has a lot of explanatory power.<br /><br />So I'm giving it 5 stars since it really should be on your reading list.  Darn it though, I wish they had better writing skills or a decent editor to trim it.  This book would be stellar if the authors had followed the dictum of first write your book, then throw half of it away.  So you, dear readers, will just have to deal with it.

B0051CSI0G|2.0|Imagine \\"I Am Legend\\" being remade for roughly $50,000 and you have this movie's flavor. Zombie-esque vampire plague destroys most of America, leaving a few enclave towns (oddly) untouched and most of the nation a wasteland. \\"Mister\\" an alleged tough vampire killer wanders the ruined nation with his apprentice Martin, who is our narrator. The two eventually run afoul of a Christian cult that worships the vampires and much strife ensues.<br /><br />This film is surprisingly good in some ways considering it is a low budget first time effort. The set design and cinematography set a nice bleak mood, suiting the theme. The action sequences are filmed pretty well. The special effects and gore all appear to be \\"real\\", i.e. no CGI. (Take note, George Romero, who uses little else but lame CGI in what passes for his recent zombie films...) The director does have some promise.<br /><br />However, the plot is pretty non-existent and feels both episodic and sluggish. More importantly, the characters are extremely bland and its hard to care about even the leads. Mister is a single note sounded over and over again, Martin is as bland and dull as a post office clerk, and the other characters are even less interesting. The cult leader is about as threatening as a stuffed animal, and the entire Christian vamp cult thing gets too much screen time considering how uninteresting it is in both theory and execution. Someone obviously thought that was a way cool idea, but the viewer may disagree.<br /><br />Some plot elements are fairly half-baked as well. The odd ability of the cult to track the heroes over long distances is not well explained. The existence of the enclave towns also is hard to explain as the vamps are supposedly unstoppable killing machines whom only trained hunters like Mister can deal with, yet a fairly large town seems to be very secure on the basis of a roadblock manned by yokels with shotguns. Just more evidence of a fairly undeveloped script.<br /><br />I really wish there was more going on here with both plot and characters, as the existing mix does not mesh well with the directors technical skill. Hopefully next time, he'll be paired with a better script and actors. As it is the movie feels very long subjectively, as the utter lack of viewer engagement with the protagonists and their adventures pretty much ruins the fllm. Scariest thing in here is the Kelly McGillis cameo; what happened to her? She looks like Camille Paglia now, and her acting is, if anything, even worse than it was in her screen icon days...h there was more going on here with both plot and characters, as the existing mix does not mesh well with the directors technical skill.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|So simple, but the clever animation makes this so much fun.  Downloaded a while, but wish I started playing sooner.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I love to read especially when the characters can come to life in my mind.  While this book was very good, it didn't come to life for me.  I think from a historical standpoint it would be a good read to explain some of the German point of view of WWII but it also seems to portray stealing as being ok.  It gives crossed signals, and unless children have good knowledge of right and wrong, it may seem like it's ok to go through an open window and take what you want.<br /><br />Parents should read this with their kids, even if the child is over 14, to explain things to them and help them form the correct feelings and ideas of this time in history.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I have long been a film fan and Departures now ranks in my top five all time best.  it won a controversial best foreign film Oscar in 2008 despite mixed to poor critical reviews.  However, it was a major hit with film-goers in Japan.  One cultural nuance is that the people who prepare the dead for cremation in Japan are viewed with disdain since the dead are perceived as unclean.  Hence, a movie that elevates this profession to a noble level is culturally shocking in Japan.  The star is an ex-boy band leader, not a professinal actor, and so it is remarkable from that perspective as well.  The original score is gorgeous and is centered around the cello, a symbol of both the female figure, and the closeness to one's body when it is played.  The cello has also been mentioned as the instrument closest in pitch and volume to the human voice.  There are many ironic elements in the film such as the focus on eating (apparently, people who do this work become ravenous afterwards!).  Many of the scenes are exquisitely shot and remind audiences of classic japanese landscapes.  Some of the plotting is predictable and a little trite such as the symbol of stone letters.  Nevertheless, these can be forgiven when the whole is so superbly crafted.  A true work of art!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele is amazing, I could appreciate the detail the author put into the book.  The feelings and emotions were felt from each character, even the frustration and anger Christian Grey felt at time.  I was intrigued by the book because this was a genre I had never read. It was erotic, emotional, thrilling and most of all a must read book.. Some wonder why a best seller? The answer is simple, every women in america wants a Christian Grey even all of his bad habits and his almost outlandish sexual behavior, secretly we want to live the lavish life he lives, and even would consider being the SUB! What is lovely about this story its almost a tale of how the beauty tamed the beast inside Christian, Anastasia a young women with moral values, smart, funny and very independant at first its not noticed but throughout the stories she holds her own and does not let this strong willed man break her down. Many women no matter what age can learn alot from her character, her boldness and simple way of dressing is what's the most attractive to Christian about her.. Smartness and Wittyness are so sexy!<br /> I Love their Love Story.. Great book, and its a must read for my book club!<br /><br />Always amazed with the authors!<br />Book Beauty-
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is really a good knife sharpener.  Everything from kitchen knives, carry knives and hunting knives.  It is not where I end in my knife sharpening process but it is where I start.  If I have a knife that is dull or one that I having used a lot and want to sharpen I start here with the carbide slot and touch up the edge.  Then it is time to go to the ceramic slot for the next level of sharpness. This level of sharpening is good for a utility knife for me and I leave it at that.<br /><br />The cross carbide and ceramic stones are reversible and replaceable if you ever need to do that.  The carbide stones set the taper while the ceramic stones hone the edge to a sharp finish.  It also features a diamond round rasp for touching up straight edges and serrated edges but it is only a 400 grit.  I like that it is portable and you can throw it into your pocket or backpack and tie a lanyard to it use to tie it to a belt loop or backpack.  It does have a finger grip on it but make sure to hold it firmly and on something stable.<br /><br />This does sharpen at a fairly blunt angle and if I want a very sharp knife I use a large Arkansas stone and a drop of oil. Overall though this is a good product and for most knives it is more than adequate to sharpen them to the edge you need.  For a hunting knife I like to really use a large stone.

I hope they make this into a major motion picture. I kept thinking the whole way through the book that this would be an awesome movie. The writer does a great job of descibing everything so you feel as if you are watching a movie. The storyline was great and a refreshing change. There are many descriptions of the storyline on here and I have nothing else to add. It's a great series! Read it or you'll be put to cleaning![[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]
B0055SWM08|5.0|Each level unique, challenging and requiring thought. Enjoyed the twists of each new level. Just when you think you've got it (how to move, avoid obstacles, use moveable blocks, etc.), expect to learn something else. Music fits the game and keeps you calm.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly Clarksons' new CD has proven that she is the greatest American Idol contestant to emerge from the 7 plus years of existence. Just when you think she can't improve on her last CD she proves critics wrong as usual.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Another great book by Lee Child. Love the Jack Reacher series.<br /><br />The character is tall, cool, strong, independent, smart with a sensitive side.<br /><br />The story is excellent, keeps you guessing, good mystery, surprising twist & turns
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love Sarah McLachlan albums and this one is a special one. She has a unique voice and certain songs on this album like Silent Night and Song For. A. Winter's Night, are excellent.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I own most of Gavin's music and can listen to it continually -- but this is the CD I go back to the most often and never tire of.  (Given that it was released eight years ago and I'm just commenting on it now says something.)  It's a treat to hear both the full studio recordings and the stripped down versions (which are like being at a live performance).  I love the gutsy, \\"garage band\\" feel of the stripped versions -- especially on \\"Chemical Party\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Be.\\"<br /><br />Gavin has a versatile voice.  Depending on the song, it takes on a different timbre and communicates a wide range of emotions.  There aren't many singer-songwriters who can interpret a song like he can.
0345803485|4.0|Pure glorious smut! This book, being the first in the trilogy, starts out a little bit slow but lays the groundwork by letting you get to know the main character, Anastasia Steel. This is a romance novel on steroids that casts a glow on the world of BDSM to those who are not acquainted with the world of bondage, discipline, dominant, submissive, sadism, and masochism. If you want to escape to another world for a little while and possible spice up your sex life, this book (and the 2 that follow) may be for you. Overlook the few type-os in the e version and enjoy the ride.  While this book is not necessarily the highest form of literary magnificence you will be interested in these characters and it is definitely OK to like these books!

B004EN8KE2|5.0|It looks like I will be in the minority in liking the reader of this book. I have listened to all 3. I have not read them in the traditional book form at all. I did pick up a friend's copy of Catching Fire and didn't find it as interesting as listening. I enjoyed this narrator. I listen to audiobooks while I am at work and have listened to dozens upon dozens. While there have been books in the past that I couldn't even get past the first chapter because the narrator was so bad. I vastly prefer the way this narrator read the different parts as opposed to keeping it all monotone. I have already purchased the Hunger Games in audiobook form so that I will have my own copy, and will be purchasing this one as well.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Great CD. Nothing like opening a CD and reading liner notes. Beats the \\"instant\\" soulless iTunes format any day of the week. Thoroughly enjoyed the songs on this CD. Granted the style is quite varied, but you can listen to all the songs- it is a refreshing change from the pop songs (Beiber, Rihanna etc) playing on the radio today.<br />This is the real deal- voice &  multi-talented.<br />Music today is all about a per-determined image and sound- I mean how many songs  can be about parties and clubs?<br />Lets see if Gotye can stay true to himself or be pressured into the current mold by the record execs in the future. I suspect he will stick to his roots.<br />And please don't insult Kimbra by comparing her to Katy Perry.
1400069289|3.0|You can clearly see the talent that has made author Duhigg so successful as an investigative journalist at the NY Times. He breaks the book down into sections, covering the habits of individuals, the habits of successful organizations such as Starbucks (I have a Starbucks habit, do you? Now I see that didn't just happen by coincidence.) and the habits of communities and societies. In a word - fascinating.<br /><br />I only have one gripe, which is that although I have an increased understanding of human nature and even worldwide conflict, I still don't know how to kick my Starbucks habit. In other words, this is not a \\"how-to\\" book on kicking or modifying habits, or creating new ones. If that's what you're looking for, you'd best look elsewhere. If your \\"habit\\" is to read at night before bed and you want a thought-provoking and absorbing read, this is it.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This is a well designed case for the Kindle Fire.  The mounting system holds the Fire securely while leaving access to all the buttons and ports on the Kindle Fire itself.  The nonslip inner surface lets you used the Kindle Fire at a variety of angles for watching video, playing games, typing etc.<br />The red case is in fact a nice bright red.<br />The only complaint, as mentioned by others, is that the vinyl cover has a really \\"off\\" smell. For something used so close to you, it's really an unacceptable smell and requires some \\"treatment\\" before it is usable.
1577314808|5.0|I was dealing with a great deal of anxiety and depression prior to reading this book.  Im the type of person that avoids doctors or in this case a shrink at all cause.  I figured after a few sessions with a shrink, I would probably be pre-scribed with a drug and would not be happy.  I knew the axiety/depression was self-induced but did not know how to deal with it and felt helpless.<br /><br />This book litterally opened my eyes to what I was doing to myself.  I am still a work in progress, but this masterpiece has really changed my perspective on life.
0439023513|5.0|I thought that Mockingjay was a wonderfully written conclusion to the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It kept with the numerous plot twist that I loved about the other two books up till the very end.  Very satisfied with the book A+!
141690977X|5.0|This book has the insight that I think all women and men should read because sometimes even men misread signals. My friends and I have been contemplating writing the book,\\" She's just not that into you,\\" for our male friends. That aside, the book takes very casual, normal and everyday situations and puts an absolutely hilarious spin on very serious advice.<br /><br />You need to be open to advice in an unconventional way to appreciate this book. Although the advice is universal, some folks may not like the abrupt, impersonal and lack of subtlety conveyed. It is from a man's point of view, the way a man would speak.<br /><br />The movie did not do this book justice. Love love love this book

B005NQ5LSC|5.0|Greetings all, I hope you are well. I have seen Daniel (Yu-Hang) To in the other Ip Man movies (Ip Man, Ip Man 2, both are excellent movies) and he did a solid job in those movies with smaller roles. I was a bit surprised to see him as the main featured actor in a role as Ip Man but he does a very good job, both with humility and pride. I appreciate the fact this movie focuses on the development / advancement of Wing Chun, portrayed by Ip Chung, an \\"authentic\\" Wing Chun practitioner and son of the actual Ip Man. Ip Chung plays the role of Leung Bik and portrays him well for the brief amount of time he appears on screen.<br /><br />Like the previous Donnie Yen featured Ip Man movies, The Legend Is Born centers on the Japanese invasion of China, and the response of the Chinese people. There are civil wars as well as struggles to unify China versus Japan. The martial arts action is quite good, intentionally amusing at various times, and not over the top with their usage of wires for some of the stunts. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies, martial arts movies, and / or is interested in the martial art of Wing Chun.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I'm really hooked.... the game is great. I think everyone agrees that it makes you feel like a sucker to buy the glu coins /credits though.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is the first book I read from Patrick Rothfuss, and I defenitely will read more. The story is very entertaining, and well written, I could see the the whole plot unfolding in front of my eyes.<br /><br />The characters are deep, well drawn, without any cliches. For me the most important about characters, that their acts are based on their emotions, thoughts, earlier experiences. So nothing sudden an unexpected happens, nor they have attributions only for the sake of the story. Rothfuss did it well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the world building. It is so detailed, that I had the feeling like reading a real story, not a fiction. The places were well described. I was not overwhelmed by the history, but always got enough information to be able to place what was happening. The magic, mithology and arkana is worked out well, makes sense, not overdone.<br /><br />At the beginning I thought it flowed slowly for my taste, but then I realised that every event had its importance, and was referred to later. I was sorry when I arrived at the end, and decided to buy the next book in the series.

Others make apps they hope you will want, just to gather your information for their own purposes. Uninstalling.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|What a book! The characters are fantastically written and it is impossible to choose a favorite. There is a lot going on and yet the thread of the story stays beautifully in tact. Although it is a long story every page leaves you wanting more! In so many instances when a book has been brought alive on screen,the book always proves to be better but in this case the Tv series and the book was very similar if not exactly the same, so if you have seen the series, the book will bring you nothing new.
B00122BERI|5.0|Everybody loves their daily commute to work...right? Well, listening to this young woman's voice helps you navigate your way through the life threatening hazards presented by drivers who wear their rectums as collars.<br /><br />As I listen Renee's sultry voice she makes me wish that the music--most of which were hits before I was born--she covers was still contemporary. Amazon delivered this dose of \\"Soul Medicine\\" for me this time and I'll be sure to look for more that Renee has to offer through them, but if this young performer ever comes to my area I'll be sure to catch her show.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was fantastic! A great mix of action,romance,gore and some unpredictable writing. A real page turner. Kept me reading until the wee hours of the night.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|These guys are so passionate about what they do. They never give up, always go the extra mile... such balls, especially on this record. The sound is warm and crisp, like you're there in the studio, and the songs are so emotionally unique and, again, so passionate. This is Rush's best album of this period for sure. Geddy's bass has to be heard to be believed. Alex is on top, and Neil kicks... and his lyrical artistry is at a peak... alright, so if you go in with the highest expectation, which you likely have when it comes to Rush, you will not be disappointed. I'm listening to the album right now, hung over, and about to go work out, and I'm so pumped up about life because I put this record on. Go get 'em boys!

B0069JBKHI|3.0|As an IT engineer I picked this up for the ability to use our home network and any of the Ipad's or Iphones that we have in the house; as well as the techie part. It was very easy to setup, at least for me. The video does have a good bit of lag/latency and the quality is not as good as I expected. My home network does not use \\"consumer/home\\" grade products such as 99% of the individuals who would be using a product like this as it is not cost effective to have 10K bucks in networking equipment for home connectivity. This was running over a pure Cisco enterprise level network with Cisco Aironet AP's with QOS setup to give the camera/video traffic priority over any other type of traffic but that only gave me a slight performance increase. The Aironet series also uses \\"clean air technology\\" so interference from other sources is non existent . I also tried it on the wired side plugged into a Cisco Catalyst 3750 switch and still the same results. The audio had a pretty big lag as well and when playing the lullaby and listening to it over the iPhone/iPad there was a ton of overlap if you were anywhere close to being able to hear both at the same time; This was due to the latency. I think it is a great concept but the codec's need to be adjusted and the frame rate increased. We also purchased the Motorola setup to compare and even though I can't access it from \\"anywhere\\" the voice/video has zero latency and it just flat out works out of the box which will keep my wife happy. I will set up one of my HD Axis camera's for local and remote viewing that is not limited to Apple products; also this will be free for me and will produce MUCH voice and video quality that the Withings unit can ever think about doing.. The Withings unit will be returned tomorrow to the Apple store.. Get the Voice and Video as good as the Motorola unit and I would buy it again for the techie aspect of it.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|I have always loved Stephen King movies but this is one of his better ones.  It has a great story line and a really shocking ending!
B005BDZN62|5.0|\\"West Side Story\\" is among the greatest-ever movie musicals, glorious winner of the 1961 Best Picture Oscar and nine other Academy Awards.  (My other top 5 musicals, all named Best Picture, are: \\"My Fair Lady\\", \\"Gigi\\", \\"Chicago\\", and \\"The Sound of Music\\".)<br /><br />In this 50th Anniversary \\"West Side Story\\" Blu-ray Edition, both sound and picture are marvelous.  Unfortunately a pair of Blu-rays left audio and video out of synchronization.  Audio was just enough ahead of video to become terribly distracting, certainly for me, a super fan of \\"West Side Story\\".<br /><br />I'm thankful for ideas below I tried, helping me find a solution.  They suggested a fix tailored to my own equipment, rather than blaming the Blu-ray.  The leading suspect thus became \\"7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\\".  It was the \\"West Side Story\\" Blu-ray default audio setting, an advance way beyond the capacity of my 20-year old analog receiver/pair of great speakers to handle properly.  And I routinely ignored audio settings for movies, such as variations upon Dolby Digital 5.1.  Did not seem to matter, until \\"West Side Story\\".<br /><br />With concert DVDs, always in synchronization, I tried to choose whatever audio option sounded best.  That usually turned out to be something like Dolby 2.0, a simple, outdated, surround sound choice for my analog receiver and two speakers.  (The endless variety of audio choices under DVD/Blu-ray \\"setup\\" still confuse me.)<br /><br />\\"West Side Story\\" offered \\"4.0 Dolby Digital\\", an alternative to \\"7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\\", the default.  Changing that audio setting to \\"4.0 Dolby Digital\\", together with unplugging/re-plugging, and multiple acts of turning the Blu-ray player off then on, ACTUALLY WORKED.<br /><br />I will neither argue with success, nor conduct any further experiments.  All that matters is how glorious \\"West Side Story\\" appeared with video and audio in synchronization.

B004J4WKDI|3.0|The Night Circus was full of deception, illusions and magic. The story was quite interesting however it did not flow well. The jumping around of dates made it difficult to follow, and reading electronically was additionally hard. The story had a lot of characters, and I felt they were not developed as well as they could have been. I loved the midnight dinners that were held, the descriptions were well done. Another facinating part was the description of the bottles - very imaginative. The plot began and let to a very important competition between a boy and a girl, and it waw too easy to figure out what was going to happen. This was a great \\"first\\" book for Erin.
1907590099|5.0|The book arrived on date in good conditions (a slight damage in the cover, but almost certainly caused in the customs, they're very uncaring about what is inside the package).
B007CKNX28|4.0|This is, without a doubt, a Jack White album. It also sounds nothing like any other Jack White album.  Most of the songs are more likely to be driven by piano than guitar. There is very little of the blues work that made him so famous. On first listen, I was kind of confused. Blunderbuss is a very difficult album to describe. One musical passage brought a Miles Davis \\"Kind of Blue\\" vibe into my head. And it wasn't jazzy sounding, but the interplay of the different instruments fitting together that made my brain make that connection. But I listened to it a few more times and really found the songs growing on me. Even when toned down, in comparison to some other releases, this music is still played with FEELING, something Jack obviously posseses in spades. Screaming guitars aren't all over this record, but when used they still sound badass as usual. This is an album that needs to be listened to, several times preferably in headphones to really enjoy. Just give it a fair shake...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm an avid reader, 10 books per month or more. This series was enlightening (and hot) and helped me to understand that indeed there are different strokes for different folks. \\"Rough stuff\\" is on a sliding scale of scary, and can be titillating if done carefully. At least in theory.  Now I don't automatically think 'ew' and judge those who enjoy an occasional painful moment. Not for me--probably--but it WAS fun to read about.
B000FBJAOG|1.0|This book is mean to all zombies. I have two zombies living with me right now. They are totally harmless. They told me that zombies are not flesh eaters but animal eaters. They eat mainly deer and rabbits. The whole human eating thing was a rumor spread by vampires. This book is good if you believe that zombies feel the need to hurt people.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|This has the potential to be THE killer browser if they add just ONE feature: PER SITE USER AGENT? Why? Because some sites formatted for Android look like complete garbage and you're better off with desktop view. Some sites are no good in desktop or Android mode but iPad looks better. And others look better in iPhone mode. Rather than have to change my setting for every time I switch between those sites, I should have a \\"for this site\\" option whether it's a popup prompt or another settings page. Add this feature, and this app jumps to FIVE STARS! Without it, it's just eh....

I ordered these, along with a new soldering iron, and had the entire thing working in less than 15-minutes.

I highly recommend this adapter!
0547258305|5.0|This book was a great read. I enjoyed watching the characters fall in love. There was lots of action and an overall very creative story. There were no portions of the book that were skimmed at all because each word captured my mind.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Seeing THE AVENGERS at the midnight screening on Friday was not just the culmination of the excellent work that Marvel Studios has been working towards since its inception as a major filmmaking entity (and not just branding that appears before all of the other Marvel character films owned by other studios), it was the ultimate childhood fantasy come true for many comics fans: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk coming together in one big-budget Hollywood film. Sadly, for the fringe critics who have made up their minds long before seating themselves in a darkened theater and allowing this 140-plus minute moviegasm to invade their senses and assault their hipper-than-thou minds, it's also an astonishing piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />In the reviews for this film, which has at present a 94% rating on RottenTomatoes.com (hint: that means ONLY 6% of reviewers that saw it didn't like it), the negative ones say that (paraphrasing) \\"it lacks substance\\" or \\"it's a $250 million toy commercial\\" or \\"it's all flash\\". This is America and everyone is entitled to an opinion. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why people think this. I've been a student of film all of my life in one way or another and this film is the very definition of excellent ensemble and technical filmmaking.<br /><br />Joss Whedon is simply the best writer to have captured the essence of all of the characters involved and also has a very acute sense of talent, as has been proven by all of his television work from BUFFY to ANGEL to FIREFLY to DOLLHOUSE. But would Whedon be the best director for a mega-budget Hollywood Superhero Extravaganza? His only feature directorial effort prior to this was SERENITY, and that is more cult hit than big box office. Despite the lack of commercial success, what Whedon revealed with that film, as well as his small-screen directorial efforts, is that he can juggle multiple characters of an ensemble cast with giving them all equal measure in the sense of their character's essence to the story and action. Every character has their moments that are effective and definitive in Whedon's work (especially if it's the character's final moment...). Whedon here displays a technical acumen that is on par with that a lot of the \\"big\\" names (I'm looking at you, Michael Bay) who specialize in big-budget action. His use of the camera is smart and entirely confident. Of course, what Whedon does best though is directing his actors. With an ensemble of this magnitude and with just the films themselves being something psuedo-competitive, it's a logistical nightmare to try and keep ego out of the way and allow the film to breathe on its own without one actor having to do all the heavy lifting and pushing the others to the background. With Robert Downey Jr. reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans reprising Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth reprising Thor, Scarlett Johannsen reprising Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston reprising Loki, Jeremy Renner reprising Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Clark Gregg reprising Agent Phil Coulson, Stellan Skarsgaard reprising Dr. Erik Solvig, Samuel L. Jackson reprising Nick Fury as well as the big name newcomer Mark Ruffalo as the 3rd cinematic Bruce Banner/Hulk and Cobie Smulders as Fury's Gal Friday, Maria Hill, this is a TON of starpower to juggle around and keep everybody happy. However, with Whedon being Whedon, he's smart enough to make sure that all of the actors have something to do within their character's own mythology as well as giving every character at least one moment to shine brightly in the film. And shine they do.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a direct sequel to both THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, with SHIELD, with the assistance of Dr. Solvig, looking into The Tessaract (the Asgardian relic shown in THOR , but was abused by The Red Skull in CAPTAIN AMERICA) as a source of unlimited power. Loki, having somehow survived his plummet into the stars, arrives, takes the Tessaract (and some key SHIELD personnel) by force, and the call to arms is sounded. Under the guise of assembling to track The Tessaract, Stark, Rogers, and Romanoff gather to hunt down Loki with Banner back on SHIELD's Helicarrier (an AMAZING set piece) who is acting in only a scientific capacity since The Tessaract does give off trace amounts of Gamma radiation. Along the way, Thor intervenes and absconds with Loki to have Loki answer for his crimes back on Asgard. Iron Man doesn't interpret that as being a good thing, and thus begins the melee between Iron Man and Thor. Cap steps in to break it up and does so with astonishing fashion. Thor goes back with them to ensure that Loki will meet Asgardian justice as the captured Loki then sits in a holding cell on the Helicarrier and slowly begins to chip away at the already-fragmented group. An assault begins on the Helicarrier and soon the danger becomes all too real and all too immediate as Banner hulks out and begins an epic fight with Thor. The skies above New York begin filling with Loki's army of aliens, and these heroes assemble to defend, or at the very least avenge Earth.<br /><br />The film is almost flawlessly constructed from beginning to end. The first act of the heroes and villains reluctantly gathering starts everything at a good and even pace. The second act allows things to slow down a bit and allows the tension to build. The third act is well-controlled but also orgiastic in its ever-escalating superheroic combat.<br /><br />Now, the performances. Hemsworth is a relative newcomer, but he plays Thor with strength and purity and you can tell that Thor has grown emotionally from his previous outing. Downey Jr. continues the freshness of his antics but as the film opens, still has yet to overcome his own ego in order to become the hero he's meant to be. Evans is a man out of time who happily exclaims as someone around him makes a pop-culture reference he actually understands, and is also a man who longs to be the first one through the door but knows how to command. Ruffalo is the first actor who seems to really get Bruce Banner; he's afraid, but he's committed and it's become less about finding a cure and more about living with \\"the other guy\\". Johanssen hits all the right notes as the dangerous woman with a deadly past, as well as being a master manipulator. Renner has a good amount of screentime, but has the least to do with his character other than shoot arrows while looking extremely cool. Jackson is the man with all the plans; he's a virtuoso at duplicity (sometimes tri-plicity, if that's even a word). Gregg continues to be perfect as the almost zen-like Coulson (with the exception of being around Cap). The real star here though is Hiddleston. His performance as Loki oozes menace as well as mischief and fear. Basically, everyone plays exactly who they are and plays them to perfection. It's doubtful we're going to see any Oscars come out of this films' performance, but that's not the point. The film is a character piece, but the pieces are fragmented, which is exactly how it should be. And then there's Smulders, whose Maria Hill barely exists in this film other than a nod to the comic univers. Points for that, but she could have used a little more to work with (something tells me she had a bigger part that might come into play in the release of the DVD...).<br /><br />Now, the moments: Natasha's first interrogation scene. Banner's initial meeting with Natasha. The liftoff of the Helicarrier. Stark and Banner geeking out with each other. Coulson's Captain America cards. \\"They're near-mint.\\" Loki's flamboyance in suit and scepter. \\"There will always be men like you.\\" Thor's appearance on the Quinjet wing. \\"There's only one God, and he doesn't dress like that.\\" Iron Man vs. Thor. Thor vs. Cap. \\"He's adopted.\\" Stark and Banner discussing The Hulk. Natasha's reverse interrogation of Loki. Hulk. Hulk. Hulk. Thor. Hulk. Cap. Widow. Iron Man getting a suit. Hawkeye. Hulk. Hulk. The cheapest shot in all of comic-book moviedom. \\"Puny god.\\" Trying to call Pepper. Hulk. Hulk. Shawarma. Stark Tower, afterwards. \\"To battle these humans is to court Death.\\"<br /><br />Effects-wise, it's fantastic. There were no moments that looked uncomfortable or didn't seem absolutely seamless. Iron Man and The Hulk are obviously the biggest logistical problems, and they looked perfect. Whedon, ever the purist, decided that he wanted to give Iron Man back the circular chest piece as opposed to the triangular one as another nod to the old-school Avengers. The Hulk actually looks like Ruffalo (if Ruffalo was to turn giant and green), which is not just spectacular attention to detail, but also most likely a technological advancement. The invading force of aliens looks terrific, particularly the REALLY big ones.<br /><br />There are really only two things that I have issues with: 1. There seems to be a plot-hole in the 2nd act of the film regarding Loki's plan, but quite honestly, that might have actually been resolved. There were some moments that went by so fast, I might not have caught it. 2. Alan Silvestri's score is good, but it lacks any strong and iconic musical cue, like what Danny Elfman or Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did with Batman, or John Williams with Superman. Although, that has been an issue with all of the Marvel Studios films.<br /><br />I'm sure that the success of this film will continue to build a more expansive universe and more characters will have their due. While this was not an issue with the film itself, I would have loved to have seen a few more easter eggs peppered throughout the film; maybe a Luke Cage or Danny Rand cameo, or Carol Danvers or any number of current or past-roster Avengers. The two most obvious picks would be The Wasp and Giant-Man/Ant-Man. With the great Edgar Wright currently trying to put out an Ant-Man film, the time to push that forward would be now. Also, sadly, the long-rumored and long-debunked cameo of Nathan Fillion as Hank Pym doesn't exist, but it might in the future. Whedon makes it a habit to work with the same people over and over again, and while Alexis Denisof (Wesley Wyndham-Price from BUFFY and ANGEL and DOLLHOUSE) and Enver Glokaj (DOLLHOUSE) make very small appearances in this film, I think he would have liked to fit in even more. But someone will get a Marvel No-Prize from me if you can tell me which other cast member has worked with Whedon prior to this film!<br /><br />The one thing about this film is that while it firmly stands on its own, in order to understand the true magnitude of everything going on here, it is something of a requirement to see the previous films, with the exception of THE INCREDIBLE HULK. You honestly don't really need to see that since Ruffalo does an excellent job of fleshing out the character of Bruce Banner. Of course, every character does give a brief rundown of everything that's transpired before, and Whedon is smart enough to put those moments in and in a creative way. However, there isn't a single one of those films I wouldn't recommend seeing. They're all good in their own way and some are better than others but THE AVENGERS takes the cake.<br /><br />There has never been a big-screen superhero adventure like this before and the chances of lightning striking twice is slim, but if Marvel is smart, they'll get Whedon to do another AVENGERS film as well in three years, and in the interim, fill that time with new IRON MAN, CAPTAIN AMERICA and THOR films. I wouldn't mind at all seeing a Black Widow/Hawkeye film. And so long as they do it right, I absolutely wouldn't mind seeing Ruffalo in another HULK film. It really just has to be someone who knows how to make The Hulk work.<br /><br />Marvel absolutely has momentum on their side right now, and they have to make it work for them considering DC's GREEN LANTERN was something of a flop and Chris Nolan's Batman films are coming to an end this summer, and withZack Snyder's Superman reboot coming in 2013, it's time to start getting other characters in on the action.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that, while technically Batman is a superhero, I don't consider Nolan's Batman films to be superhero films; they're more dark noir-ish psychological crime thrillers than the colorful heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe and I consider THE DARK KNIGHT to still be the best COMIC BOOK film of all time, but THE AVENGERS is the best SUPERHERO film ever made.keye.

0393088774|4.0|I bought this last week and read it, and I did enjoy it.<br /><br />What this book is is a formalization of the thoughts that Krugman has been pushing on his blog, hosted by the New York Times, for the last four years.<br /><br />The thing is, if you're a reader of said blog, reading this book can feel like you're rehashing a lot of things you read about from Krugman from day to day.  You can read about the need for new stimulus, and the mocking of the \\"Very Serious People\\" who are waiting for the \\"Confidence Fairy\\", just as you can for free on the Times' site.  Here it is just put in more logical order as a self-contained argument.<br /><br />And if you're not a reader of Krugman, but hold some ideological ground opposite from what Krugman is -- Keynesian, Democratic -- you're going to think this book is trash.  There are people out there who will bash the text based on some cartoon understanding of Krugman's economics.  You can also see these people on Krugman's blog.<br /><br />But there is still the Swedish thing.  Krugman has a Nobel Prize in economics, no matter how much you want to denigrate the award, he did win it.  And the funny thing there is that he downplays the Nobel -- he doesn't use it as a cudgel to beat his opponents with.  However, Norton looks like they wanted to use it as a selling point.  I'm not saying that makes him correct, but perhaps we as a society should listen to his voice.<br /><br />But I'm not sure about the WHY of this book -- he does speak to his audience, and frankly the text is somewhat uneven.  At points it feels like he is writing to laymen, and at other points it is as if he is writing for his academic peers.  It is also rooted in time, and it doesn't feel like it will age well beyond being a cultural artifact.  The NOW of the title is very much the spring of 2012, before the election.  I can't imagine a paperback without some serious revision.  It is very much a white paper in hard cover, preaching to the converted.<br /><br />Aside from those weaknesses, I feel that Krugman is an important voice and he makes compelling arguments for the role of the state under capitalism.  I would much prefer he was the guiding light behind fiscal policy, but I will accept him as a columnist and blogger and teacher.  Perhaps we can keep shifting the terms of the debate -- and that is what this book does, I hope.  Perhaps we can end this depression, and not let it keep liquidating a generation of dreams./>Aside from those weaknesses, I feel that Krugman is an important voice and he makes compelling arguments for the role of the state under capitalism.

B006IDG2T6|4.0|Since Harris is a neuroscientist, his view on the workings of the brain and the emergence of a mind is very interesting. We you always had the idea that free will is something overrated due to the lack of knowledge about the way the brain works find this book a very good start in the discussion of this topic.<br />It is a brief book with a lot of information that Harris needs to put down and enhance in order to have a more detailed review of the way we \\"think\\" there is free will at all. Would be very interesting to have one book discussing all these topics written together with Dan Dennett and let them both try to arrive to a common conclusion.
0345803485|5.0|I could not put this book down. I was shocked and surprised that so many people had negative comments about the book. I read all three books in 5 days and have since read them for a second time. I even have my husband reading them... Maybe he will get some ideas ;) I think that E L James did great and to think she has never written before.
0345803485|1.0|It's hard to believe that any publisher took this book seriously enough to bring to the public, and it's equally hard to believe that someone is making this into a movie.  All I can think is that the author had some favors coming to her through her years in the television industry and she called them in to get this thing printed.  The characters are uneven, the dialog is poor, and the storyline is ridiculous.  I finished it because I thought the story might improve, but it didn't -- I'm not against any of the sexual situations or even the relationship dynamics, but am giving this book one star because it's so badly written.  This might be one of the few books that I actually throw away instead of passing on.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good story. I think it really showed the ability of the capital as well as gave some great insight to their ability with the mutts.  I also liked how there were surprising parts and good detail.  It was good enough to make me buy the other 2 books and read as well.  Although my fav of the 3 is Catching Fire, I think this one was very good as well.  I could tell it was written more for teens then adults as it was as descriptive, however it did the trick.  The movie didnt' do too bad at following the story up until Foxface an the berries (you will know if you have read) after that part they left out some good details.  Hope the 2nd producer can somewhat fix that, but this is about the book not the movie.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Steve Jackson Games is known these days for games you can break out and play to completion in less than an hour; perhaps even a half hour. Zombie Dice is a game where two or more players can finish a game in TEN MINUTES, and still have a pretty good time doing it. Extremely portable, as well.<br /><br />For your money, you get a heavy cardboard dice cup with lid that doubles as storage, the dice themselves, and the instructions. Dice are printed with three symbols: brains, blasts, and feet. Players are zombies; each round consists of a player rolling to see how his victims fare. Brains count as points for the player, whereas feet means the victim escaped, and a blast symbol indicates that the victim not only escaped, but let you have it with a shotgun! A player may keep rolling more dice and more rounds, but if he accumulates three shotgun blasts, he loses ALL his points for the round, and must hand off to the next player... so part of the fun is knowing when to stop!<br /><br />It's fast. It's funny. It's fun. Recommended for all fans of zombies and dice games.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was my favorite of the 3. I found it a little more detailed then the other 2 and very inticing.  I could really feel the emotion here as with the 3rd I felt there was too much going on to get the true effect of events and even felt like some nice details were left out.  This is really the best of the 3 as you can see the internal battle with right and wrong as well as her personal batter of feelings happens.
0345803485|2.0|Well, I read this book in a little more than 2 days, so it definitely kept my interest and was a decent read. I thought the story line was pretty typical for a romance/erotica novel (clumsy, doesn't-know-she's-pretty, awkward girl and a strong, gorgeous, successful man). The added s&m didn't bother me, but the scenes did get a little repetative towards the end of the book. The author has an inexperienced, less-than-professional way of writing, using certain descriptive words and phrases WAY too often. A professional editor would have tore this book apart! My only other complaint is that the story went on a little too long. By about 400 pages I was like, \\"Ok, wrap it up!!!\\"<br /><br />Overall, like I said in the title, it was moderately entertaining. Not a book I would recommend, but Im glad to say I read it. Not sure if I will read the other books in the series since I think the story is a mostly spent already and Im not sure where else she can go with it.... Not the worst book Ive ever read, but definitely no where near the best!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Not that this was a bad book, but I just felt as if some of the story line was so rushed that you didn't get any of the emotional impact that would have been essential.  Ex. Finnick and then the Holo part (being vague to not spoil anything for others).  Then there was also the lact of detail here and there, or so I thought.  It was nice just to have a wrap up of the story, but I felt it really could have taken a more intiging direction as well as filling in a few holes in the end.<br /><br />I wantd to add. I didn't want a Happily Every After ending. I was happy with the idea of some distrust, and post tramatic stress, ect.  I just felt like the getting to ending was missing some key points.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book simply to see what all the hype was about. Frankly, I have no idea what the fuss is. This book reads like it was written by a 15 year old Paris Hilton. I swear if I heard \\"that's hot\\" one more time. Who says that??? And her \\"Inner goddess\\" is more like a personality disorder. The author repeats herself over and over and over. Drives a person insane after awhile.<br />I'd save your money and rent porn- probably a better written script.<br />I couldn't finish the book- it was just too rediculous for words.<br /><br />AND just to clarify to all the people who loved the book and think that the only reason so many people are writing negative reviews is just because it is erotica- you could not be further from the truth. We are writing negative reviews because the actual storyline is terrible! The characters are annoying and completely unbelievable. The writing is juvenile at best. Apparently E.L. James only knows about four clichés to use. Really truly seriously completely awful!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's like finishing a box of chocolates you've been saving. I do this.<br /><br />I'm sad that's it over because I love, love, love Christian Grey (I am aware that I wrote that three times).<br /><br />Ms. James did an excellent job in this one of having Ana grow up and evolve as a person; and I love that aspect of Ana very much. She also did a great job of showing us the different sides to Christian and, as a reader, I enjoyed the changes I saw and felt in him as well.<br /><br />Personally, I think there could have been a whole other book where they have children and we really get to see how they've changed because, let's face it, having kids changes everything. Let's see how they do waking up at three in the morning, night after night. The tenderness in Christian and the transformation would be awesome to witness.<br /><br />Another wish. I would love to see a book from Christian's point of view completely. Just sayin'.<br /><br />Loved the series. Love Mr. Christian Grey. Can't wait for the movie!!!<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. E.L. James!!!

B000T3NMYE|5.0|I have a good many Jazz Messenger albums, including virtually all of the live ones. This, though, stands out as the one I always associate with Blakey. Moanin' is the first song that comes to mind when he is mentioned, and the line-up on this 1958 album is among the best. I personally believe that the only trumpeter Blakey had that tops Lee Morgan on this album was Clifford Brown (and technically that group was not the Jazz Messengers.)<br /><br />In addition to Lee Morgan, having Benny Golson on this album is practically icing on the cake. As a drummer I love Golson's \\"Blues March\\", which Blakey makes come alive as only Blakey can. Another favorite is \\"Are You Real\\".<br /><br />Every song, in fact, is classic Jazz Messengers and this is (in my opinion) the strongest line-up ever. While that is my personal opinion, I think that listeners will agree that the personnel in this session worked magic that would not be repeated in subsequent performances and renditions of the songs in the album.<br /><br />For folks who want to explore hard bop or the Jazz Messengers, this is a perfect starting point. Beware, though, because they can be an obsession.

B003ZSH606|4.0|While for me, Jamiroquai will never be able to surpass their first three albums without Stuart Zender--their original bass player--in the mix (which for me was half the thrill of listening to the band), this is one of the finest releases since Traveling Without Moving.  It's a shame that it hasn't been released in the states, but at least Amazon makes it easy for us Yankees to acquire.<br /><br />It seems to be in vogue to hate on Jamiroquai, which I can understand to a certain degree:<br /><br />First off, it's a white--not to mention British--band doing music clearly inspired in styles that originated in black culture.  It's always been a music industry tradition to promote bands like this with much more financial backing and energy than is often devoted to the black creators of the sound.  However, at this point Jamiroquai seems to have eschewed the industry support they used to have in favor of artistic independence, which equals minimal support on the business end, effectively returning them to underground status.  I, for example, try to keep my ear to the ground for all creative funky music being released, and I only came across this album because I've been checking Amazon every six months for one of their releases.<br /><br />Second, I've heard several extremely talented and dynamic vocalists complain that Jay Kay is something of a one-trick pony in his vocal approach.  I can see how some find this getting old, but this album moves in slightly different musical directions, which in some ways makes up for the consistency of his vocal timbre.  On top of that, the one sound he does have is a heck of a lot more pleasant to hear than the majority of voices out there, so you won't find me complaining about that.<br /><br />Finally, if you actually pay any attention to the lyrics, you'd find that this is a band trying to make a positive impact on the world.  It's not like they're just stealing a style to make bubble gum hits (which is not to imply that all their lyrics are in the vein of Gil Scott Heron's).  For all those who say people should be listening to the roots of this music instead of this current incarnation, let me be proactive in offering some suggestions: Chic, SOS Band, Slave, Pleasure, The Commodores, Cameo, Parliament/Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone, Enchantment, The Dramatics, Graham Central Station, Prince, Bloodstone, Shalamar, Bobby Womack, The Isley Brothers, The Ohio Players, and Maze--to name just a few.  That being said, even with hundreds of albums from those artists in my collection, I still take pleasure in hearing the songs on this album in my personal rotation.

006197806X|5.0|***Small spoiler alert***This was one of my long awaited books. After reading Delirium I could hardly stand the wait for Pandemonium. Lena has just been through so much and continues to do so. I almost thought she'd end up giving up but she kept fighting and it was a thrilling read. The end was awesome, I cannot wait for the third book now... A year to wait... Le sigh... But now it's become a love triangle as it so happens with many of these young adult books. What will she end up doing? One she thought to be dead and the other already set to die...

B000OY8NII|5.0|What is it like being an average joe in a town full of the world's smartest people? Eureka attempts to answer that exact question.<br /><br />Poor U.S. Marshall Jack is driving a suspect across several states (he hates flying) when a vision suddenly appears in front of his car causing him to swerve off of the road and hit a tree. The car needs extensive repair, meaning he is stuck in the unconventional town of Eureka. Nothing is every normal there, but he ends up solving a missing person case with his skills as a US Marshall. This earns him a promotion to town sheriff where he deals with the every day events in this wacky town.<br /><br />Each episode is more bizarre than the last. I honestly say that in a good way. It keeps you wondering what could possibly pop up next. So far I've only watched the first 8 or 9 episodes, but each one is better than the last. It is clear there are so many possibilities to this series, and the fact that it has been on for so long tells me they're doing something right. I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute, and can't wait to get back to the hijinks Eureka and its residents have to offer.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|\\"MARTYRS\\" Unrated, The Weinstein Company #1000146<br /><br />The Film:<br /><br />\\"Martyrs\\" is a fast-paced, well-crafted horror film, intense and harrowing. But it's nothing original. So I see no problem with offering up spoilers.<br /><br />Nothing original, did I say? That's true, but it is many many other films. It starts with a pre-credit prologue from 15 years earlier (Hallowe'en, 1978; My Bloody Valentine, 1981; many many others). In the present day, Lucie, escapee/survivor of horrific child abuse, goes gunning for the \\"parents\\" who had chained her in a dark room and beat her daily, with the assistance of her friend Anna, who is unusually fond of Lucie (Heavenly Creatures, 1994; Havoc, 2005), despite not quite believing Lucie's tales of being tormented by an unseen stalker (Terrified, 1995). Lucie tracks down the erstwhile parents and, in the film's bloodiest scene, exacts revenge (The Virgin Spring, 1960; Death Wish, 1974; countless others) with a shotgun. Or was she mistaken (Death and the Maiden, 1994)? Either way, Anna and Lucie toss the corpses in a handy pit out in the yard (Kalifornia, 1993). But one of them, the purported mother, is not quite dead (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 1975; Single White Female, 1992). Anna tries to save her from Lucie's wrath but cannot. When Lucie realizes Anna's distrust, she cuts her own throat. The end.<br /><br />Of the first half.<br /><br />Now we reach the point where everyone seems to think there's some big surprise. There is, but it's still nothing new. The big surprise is, it becomes a different film. But still not an original one.<br /><br />Anna pokes around the house and discovers a hidden door in a kitchen cabinet. It leads to an elaborate torture dungeon (Saw, 2004; Saw II, 2005; et cetera). Therein Anna rescues a current prisoner, horribly abused and tortured. Anna tries to help this pitiable creature, but then a SWAT team shows up and shoots the captive and seizes Anna. A middle-aged woman (who even looks somewhat like Ruth Gordon) confronts Anna and spouts some folderol about the eyes of those who are near death (The Asphyx, 1972), throwing in the observation that \\"women can endure more\\" (Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS, 1975). To prove it, she and her black-garbed cohorts toss Anna in the dungeon, chain her up, feed her gruel and have a thug beat her every day.<br /><br />Time passes. Anna suffers. The dead Lucie's voice comes to her and tells her to just \\"let go\\" (Star Wars, 1977). Eventually, to provoke Anna's ultimate suffering, they skin her alive. This works, apparently, and Anna becomes (in their eyes) a \\"martyr,\\" one who sees beyond death (Flatliners, 1990). The whole coven is summoned for this momentous event. Coven? Yes, you should have known by the presence of Ruth Gordon, you're actually watching \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" (1968). The whole thing has been a plot by some nefarious cult.<br /><br />With the clock winding down, the film now cops out. What did Anna report from the realm beyond death? Only the Ruth Gordon lookalike (Catherine Begin) learned, and she sticks a gun in her own mouth rather than share. The end. Again.<br /><br />The DVD:<br /><br />Single disc packaged in a standard case with no inserts. Matted widescreen presentation, enhanced for widescreen TVs. Film and sound quality are both fine, as you'd expect from a modern film. Languages include the original French and dubbed English (which is well done). Subtitles available in French, English, and Spanish. Region 1 disc. Special features include teaser, theatrical trailer, and a quite lengthy (40+ minutes) \\"Making Of\\" featurette, in French with English subtitles. Most of this latter is on-set during the home-invasion scene (when Lucie shotguns those she thinks abused her, then is attacked by her phantom stalker), interspersed with an interview with director Pascal Laugier in what looks like a hotel room and some footage with the special-effects crew in their workshop. As \\"Making Of\\" featurettes go, this one is pretty good, very informative, and a bit more than the usual promotional fluff.is one is pretty good, very informative, and a bit more than the usual promotional fluff.

B005LAIGSM|4.0|\\"What if she doesn't remember me, what then?\\" After a car accident puts Paige (McAdams) ends up in a hospital. When she wakes up she forgets that she was married and has no memory of her husband Leo (Tatum) at all. The last five years of her life are gone and Leo must now do everything he can to help her remember or lose her forever. Being a guy I was looking forward to watching this about as much as I like going to the dentist. After the \\"Notebook\\" (which I think every woman notes as her favorite movie) I was ready and waiting for an obnoxiously sappy love story that I watch to make my girlfriend happy. While it did start off this way it actually was not a bad movie and by the end I was actually interested in what was happening and I have to say as a guy I liked this more then the \\"Notebook\\". Without giving anything away the main reason I liked this was because of the ending. Watch it and you will see what I mean. On the downside half of the beginning is Tatum shirtless and one naked butt shot...so be ready for that. On the other hand if you want to score points with your lady this is a \\"chick-flick\\" that I didn't think was too bad and is surprisingly pretty good. Overall, a heavy \\"chick-flick\\" that as a guy I also kind of enjoyed. I give it a B+.

B0077ATSSQ|4.0|Somehow I just couldn't really get into this movie.  I gave it four stars because the acting was superb and it had an unusual plot.  The young boy did an incredible job (and I think this was his first major role) and of course Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock did their usual fabulous acting.  It had a very intriguing plot:  A man goes to a meeting in the World Trade Center (in one of the towers) on 9-11 and is killed.  His son finds a key in his dad's belongings, assumes that it is another of the games he and his dad used to play and starts hunting for who the key belongs to.  But it had some obstacles to overcome.  The main character (the boy) was, in his own words, odd.  In fact, he was very strange and I could easily imagine how hard it was for his mom, confronted with this brilliant little oddity, to figure out how to deal with him.  Actually, the movie worked that out fairly well and it also eventually worked out something that bothered me through a large part of the movie; the fact that this kid ran all over New York, day and night, by himself.  I grew up in a town with about 200 people (living in the town itself; the rural area around it had 3 or 4 times that) and my mother wouldn't let me play in the front yard by myself, even in the daytime.  His mother seemed a little uncaring.  However, as I said, that was explained a little (though not very well, in my opinion) at the end of the movie.  There's some profanity, too, although it's kind of disguised, but not so well that you don't know what he's saying.  And one last thing, I never have figured out where the name came from.  If it was explained in the movie, I missed it.  I suppose it doesn't really matter, but it bothered me.  Bottom line:  it's worth one watch (as anything with Tom Hanks and/or Sandra Bullock probably is) but whether you ever watch it again depends on the type of person you are and what kinds of movies you like.  It was just a hard movie to enjoy, unless you like somewhat oddball movies.

B0073T9LDI|4.0|While not perfect by any means, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is definitely an entertaining mystery.  I found the characters to be, for the most part, engrossing and the book kept me wanting more.  It does suffer at times from a common problem that many mysteries share which is balancing between making the mystery revealable to the reader without being obvious.  Ultimately, I do not think that the book quite pulls this off as I'm not sure that there is sufficient clues in the narrative to enable the reader to solve the mystery until it is actually be spelled out.  However, I cannot fault Larsson too much on this as I feel that this is pretty common among mysteries.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me was the attempt at meshing a few different story lines in the book.  There are two main story lines developed throughout the book with a third minor story line (which really is more of a character development line).  The two main story lines; however, never really mesh all that well in my opinion and it really seems to become obvious near the end of the book.  In many respects, there are actually two endings to the book because each of the two main story lines need their own attention and the book comes off feeling like it was really one and a half stories put into one book.<br /><br />All that being said though, I did thoroughly enjoy the book.  I thought the characters were believeable and entertaining. The missteps that Larsson makes in the book are really only minor detractions and the book is certainly worth reading.  I will definitely check out the follow up books and frankly, assuming that they are equally entertaining, I will find it to really be a shame that Larsson unfortunately passed away, meaning that we will only have the three.

B0034G4P9E|5.0|The Movie was totally unbelievable a must see for all types of Movie fans! The shipment was fast quick, cheap and was in excellent condition BRAND NEW! A must own Movie for youre collection!
0345803485|3.0|This book had potential, however, the author's writing skills are mediocre at best.  She's redundant and at times reading this book can become tedious.  However, being the Type A control freak that I am, it was impossible for me to put this book down and move on to the next.  I had to know what happens in the end, without taking shortcuts.  I do believe that the author had a good idea, very similar to Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\".  Only this time it was written for us \\"big girls\\".  She had many steamy scenes; I had to keep shushing my children and husband through those (hehehe).<br /><br />So to sum it up: crappy writing, good plot.  E.L. James would have benefitted by having a thesaurus on hand.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok,  so I got it. my friend did so I found it and bought it. first,  stupid name. its 224 games. just SAY 224 GAMES OMG!  and the sushi game,  Wht the heck?  REALLY I CANT EVEN PUT IT ON THERE! but other than that game and the hyperspace game,  its ok. get pet salon. it rocks. also draw something.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|very slow plot progression, poor acting. i expected more from these actors. i do not recommend. the main character acts poorly. not enough dialog.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|its a fun game but you did expect it to have two worlds. also if you get bored try getting all three stars on all levels I know that got me through the day. but stop complaining that the game is bad its just like the other angry birds games except it adds gravity to it.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|It eliminated the need for my laptop in most cases. I can run things live on my desktop that would not be possible on a tablet app. I have made complicated modifications to Excel spreadsheets while in meetings and sent pdf versions to participants all from my Xoom and I never left the table. The UI feels like so much like Windows that I don't have to think about it very much.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I loved this movie. I was only going to watch half of it at first, but then I couldn't hit the stop button. I know there are some reviews that say it is too cliche, and they may be right. A family at war with itself, two brothers destined to fight each other, and both with compelling reasons for why they need the money.  But that's what makes this a great movie. I knew where it was headed the entire time and still was entirely involved in the movie. If your a movie lover and not someone who thinks they're an expert critic movies (or mma for that matter) then you will enjoy this movie.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this ap is a must tor those of us that can't resist making checklists for everything that needs to be done.

B004SBQAN8|1.0|First I read the book I am number Four, and thought it would be fun to get the movie from redbox and watch it.  I realize they where going to change some things from the book, but how bad can it be.  In short Horrific.  SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />OK I'll admit the battle at the end was kind of cool, but not at all how it happened in the book, and they did a good job with the death of number 3 in the very beginning.  After 3 died though this movie just got worse as it went on.  It seemed to me like they thought they could rewrite the whole story and do it better then the author.  WRONG.  They changed just about everything in the movie, and not one thing was even close to being as good as it was in the book.  They changed the relationship between John and Henri.  It felt like there was a lot of conflict between the two of them, and that John just didn't care about anything that Henri had to say.  In the book the two of them have a great relationship there is some conflict as there is in all relationships, but over all they have a great relationship.  Where is that in the movie I didn't see it.  wasn't there a fire in the book that led to teh Mogs finding out about John, and finding him which led to the final battle at the school.  What about Henri it felt like they whre in a rush to get rid of him honestly having him die by the side of the road, and leaving it at that.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  Maybe I read a different book but wasn't Henri alive for the final battle at the school.  Wasn't he running around with a shotgon.  Didn't he die at the end of the battle.  One more thing what was with the extra stuff.  They added a lot of stuff in the movie that was not in the book.  Note to the writers if you can't get the movie right when somebody else writes the story then don't try to add extra stuff.  How do you think that is going to end.  All I can say is WOW this was bad.  Perhaps I am deluded but it seems like the writers of this movie followed a different story line, and I'll be honest if I am crazy and the book is like this movie then I think I want to stay crazy because its a much better story.  PLEASEE DO NOT WATCH THIS READ THE BOOK.

B004UA8D2S|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. The cinematography was very well done, with some breathtakingly gorgeous underwater cave scenes. The dialog was quite bad at times, but it got the job done. The uber-master-cave-explorer role was a bit over-done, over-acted, and the actor reprised his role a bit from his part in Jurassic Park as the grisly uber-hunter. He's good in these kinds of roles. I say, just enjoy the film, enjoy the scenes, and stop trying to make an academic study out of it, all you film nerds!! :)

0743275667|5.0|This was the first book I have read by Alan Judd and found it extremely well written, the characters came to life, the story-line well crafted and, for me, it exceeded the hype from the press reviews. It seemed to have a similarity of style with Le Carre and Alan Furst, both of whom I find an excellent read. I enjoyed it so much I had to purchase other books by the same author, and again was delighted by the read.
0439023513|5.0|I really liked the first book, The Hunger Games. The second in the series, Catching Fire, was surprisingly,<br />better than the first and Mockingjay was great too. I loved the surprising twist and turns of the books and couldn't<br />put them down.I highly recommend the trilogy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Gives my fingers and my synapses a workout!<br /><br />It's SO much better than Angry Birds. It's just as addictive without being judgmental.  :-)<br /><br />'Nuff said.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game. I cant stop.playing it.I.intentionally bought the.kindle fire and the game for my 3 year old but I play with.it more than her
0345803507|5.0|I just finished the trilogy and WOW. Reading books 1 & 2 I just could not put it down, I had it on my mind all of the events transpiring and what will happened next. The ending was perfect and I felt completely content in my heart and happy for them. I laughed, cried a little, blushed at times, cheered for them and even learned from them. Christian and Ana weathered the storm and I could not have imagined a better ending. Heck, he even cries a little!  The Epilogue was even better. The bonus chapters brought us into Christian's mind and we can see from the very beginning as much as he tried, he never truly saw Ana as another sub. I honestly don't want more, it's perfect that way it is and they are at peace with their lives and that makes me completely satisfied with this trilogy. I have NEVER said that about a book before because I have never become emotionally attached to characters like this. We learn that unconditional love can be tried and tested and in the end, it will win. We see a very dark soul become free and embrace the fact his wife genuinely loves him, Fifty Shades and all.<br />When it was all said and done --I missed so much what we had in the beginning. It reminded me that relationships are hard, but if I want to be happy... really happy... then it takes work. I learned to feel more comfortable in my sensuality, to not be afraid to ask for what I want and need from him. Life is so hard and if we can find our way back to even a little bit of the jealousy, the great sex, and being so into each other we can't stand it then maybe, just maybe, we won't end up on the down side of the statistics.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|I see 15 negative reviews.<br /><br />Fans of Soderbergh's The Limey or Out of Sight will like this.  It's not a typical action movie, shouldn't be sold as one, and those 15 reviewers were probably looking for another Jet Li movie or some crap.  This is good storytelling, it's just not their thing.  Forgive their ignorance and give this movie a shot.  Beautifully shot, realistically written.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Such s fun game. Great mindless game to play while watching Tv. Only problem.....I completed all the levels. I would love if they added more
B007EC6FIS|5.0|A superb uplifting, fresh and distinctive album from Keane, whom themself claim is their best yet and worthy of their \\"classic\\" label, much like their bestselling Hopes & Fears album.<br /><br />This album will definitely be a number one, as like ALL of their previous albums. I hope this album goes on to conquer even more though and will remind people that Keane still exist and are better than ever.<br /><br />I have always been a Keane fan and they are without a doubt my favourite band of all time. In today's climate, they continue to provide original, unique and varied music as can be displayed from their contrasted differences produced in each album.<br /><br />The quality of each song in this album is remarkable and are all worthy of commercial success, something that sadly hardly any bands of today even come close to. The strong and unmatched vocals from Tom deliver as like always and the lyrics and sound scape produced by Tim, along with bass and beats from Richard and new member Jesse come together wonderfully to create 16 unique powerful spine chilling songs, each with meaning by examining youthful memory, to fuel a sense of hope for the future.<br /><br />I would recommend you purchase the deluxe version over the standard for the little extra cost that it is, the extra tracks are definitely worth it, including the titled album track Strangeland. This album is sure to more than please the current word wide fan base and will provoke and perhaps irritate the bands critics, since this album is raw music talent at its best. Keane deserve all the success and platform they WILL receive from the reception of this enchanting album.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book for my son last year when he graduated and thought it was only appropriate to get it again for my daughter. Although it is a children's book, it says what needs to be said to older kids getting ready to cross over from childhood to adult and face the world.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun! a lot like Mario and I'm rating it to get the rest for free but it is still pretty fun
B007SY3CEW|1.0|its a fun game... it just really sucks that the touch screen doesn't register you pressing three keys ever! making it impossible to play those chords and thus making the songs with many three note chords impossible to sound descent or get a good score on... and for an app that i paid nearly $3 for... what a waste!!!
B007EC6FIS|2.0|After their first 2 albums it seemed that Keane could do no wrong. Like millions of others I was excited when \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" was released. Like millions of others I was deeply disappointed when I listened to it. The first 2 tracks were a different sound for Keane, but not too bad. By track 3 it was apparent they Keane had changed and not for the better. There were some standout tracks on \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" and maybe even still a little of that Keane magic, but any trace of the Keane they we fell in love with after hearing \\"Hopes and Fears\\" had left the building by track 8. Let's not even talk about \\"Night Train\\". Complete waste of effort there. So now we enter this \\"Strangeland\\". I really got excited when I flipped through the first few tracks. It really sounded like the old Keane might be back, but after a more critical listen it was clear that they were not coming back. It is a very safe album, but the trade off it that there is no magic. Literally the only major standout track is \\"Sovereign Light Cafe\\" and even that song could have been a B side to anything from the first 2 albums.
0385528752|5.0|Switch is a brilliant easy to read book on how we are really motivated.  The authors explanation of the difference between an intellectual and an emotional understanding alone makes the book worth buying. I have read most every major book on motivation in recent years and I think this one might be the best.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Works well, some features missing or not easily available, but ok for normal phone users. Simple and effective.  Recommend. Blah blah blah.
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit starts off wonderfully well.  The author's explanations on how habits are created and how we can change our habits is fantastic.  I was not that interesed in how businesses, such as stores, take advantage of our buying habits but this part was well written and entertaining enough.  I was hopeful that the book would provide a bit more about how we can change our individual habits but it ends rather abruptly.<br /><br />Still, a very good book and a worthwhile read.
0345803485|1.0|I am appalled that Americans have turned this into a bestseller.  I think a sixth-grader could write more skillfully than this moron.  Really?  A trilogy?  A motion picture?  To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.  Pure garbage.  A complete rip-off of 9 1/2 weeks--only that was more entertaining.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Simone Elkeles and while I heard great things about it I still didn't quite know what to expect from it. You just never know if something will live up to its hype.<br />Let me tell you that this book certainly lived up to all the hype and then some. I had such a hard time putting it down, in fact I devoured it! I stayed up to read it because I was so close to finishing it that I just had to know how it ended. I wanted Brittany and Alex to have a happily ever after so badly.<br />I love how each chapter  fluctuated between Alex's POV and Brittany's. Some books can't pull that off but this one was beautifully done. It was seamless and I loved getting both of their  perspectives to the story.<br />I am a sucker for reading about star crossed lovers and I love how this one made their situations so real. I loved the diversity in it. Different races, status and circumstances but ultimately two very similar people that have a connection that can't be denied but both must overcome some very real, very hard obstacles in their lives if they want to be together and take a chance on love.<br />This story was beautifully written and I would recommend it to anyone who is an Echols or Dessen fan.
0553573403|5.0|With so many reviews, it is hard to find something new to say. The multiple perspective format is sheer genius. This book will have you backtracking to re-read sections because you simply can't believe what you read. It is the start of a series that will bring you back again and again. You will struggle with wanting to read fast to know what happens next versus wanting to savor every moment.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell was a surprise for me, in many ways. It is the most gorgeous app I have ever seen, the music is brilliantly composed and the puzzled are cleverly done. A great game to sit and think about for a while, and the simple experience of playing is a one of the best I have ever known. Controls are intuitive, no hidden bugs that I could find, all in all one of the most polished apparently I have seen, period. Definitely a worthy addition to anyone's collection.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Many US fans of the zombie genre will just love the movie because it is well done. However, if you are a fan of British telly and films, you will see some very prominent faces in some unlikely roles. Also, the many tips of the hat to the Romero films can be found by anybody who is a die hard zombie nut. The fun thing to do at my house is try and find background actors in multiple scenes of the film. THIS IS A FUN MOVIE!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hooked on this book within the first hour.  It then became a drug to me as it was totally addictive and I could not be without it whether it was at the gym, chiropractor or wee into the hours of the night.  I could not get enough and I breezed through the trilogy on a \\"high.\\"  Now what?.....
0307719219|5.0|Finally someone has created a new economic model explaining poor and wealthy nations. The Harrod-Domar model failed because it was based on capital accumulation and did not make sense in the long-run. The Solow model argued for \\"steady states\\" and that the poorest nations would develop faster than the rich, leading to global convergence. This was way off.<br /><br />The global status quo is not universal convergence. Instead, it is dual-convergence, where wealthy countries form a group on the cutting edge of technological progress and poor countries remain poor, and provide extractive natural resources and labour for the rich.

If you are ready to roll up your sleeves and put some hard work in to make your own success, here's the blueprint to do so. If not, that's ok too, this isn't for everyone.<br />Good luck!
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|big history buff but no clue bout the Tudor dress accuracy, enjoyed Natalie soooo much more than the wasteland of Black Swan, the simple story of buying into wealth and power is prolly not much different today ya think?  the men and women who rule the world have alot more to deal with in trying to preserve their presence, affluence, and divesting personal interests in the hopes of gaining or maintaining... a most horrible existence imho, so they have a crown of jewels and an invite to court, but the frivolity of head severing is daunting and a very real documented fact, how much more do you simpletons need for entertainment, buncha whina f's, this was a good film that portrayed many aspects of life even relevant to today... kudos to the DP! recommend
0312641893|5.0|It is clear from the title that this book is a take on the Cinderella story (I will admit I am a sucker for new takes on fairy tales).  There is a girl who is pushed down at every turn, and a ball and a prince.<br /><br />This is a futuristic story set in New Beijing.  After the fourth world war, the countries of the world have been consolidated down to only 6 ruling countries.  New Beijing is ruled by an Emperor and the story allows us to get to know the Crown Prince, Kai.  He is charming and very likeable.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg that has been adopted into a family.  For the purpose of this story, a cyborg is a person who has had robotic parts attached to their body in place of missing limbs, etc from accidents.  Cyborgs are considered second class citizens.  The adopted father died very soon after adopting Cinder and left her the mercies of her evil stepmother and 2 stepsisters (one likeable, one not).  Cinder is put to work as a mechanic and has an android Iko for her best friend.<br /><br />There are moon people in this book! And they are called Lunars.  Basically they are humans that traveled to the moon a long time ago but has since changed into another race of beings with powers normal humans don't. Earthens are afraid of them and they have good reason.  Their Queen is evil and is coming to New Beijing.<br /><br />There is a plague spreading over the whole Earth, claiming more lives.  Prince Kai must decide whether to save his people (if he can), or himself.<br /><br />The rest of the story takes us through Cinder's relationships with Prince Kai, a scientist whom you wonder \\"Is he good or bad\\", but eventually that becomes clear, her little sister Peony and her desire to flee New Beijing.<br /><br />It was a super fast read, I read it in 2 days.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  It didn't make me obsessive after finishing the book, but I am still thinking about the characters and what happens next a week later and I can't wait for the next book with Little Red Riding Hood.  Why oh why are they only coming out once a year!th Little Red Riding Hood.  Why oh why are they only coming out once a year!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another great book by David Baldacci.  The thing I like about him is that, even though his plots can be similar in general brushstrokes, they always find a way to be unique.  I really like the Will Robie character and hope he becomes an offshot series.  Reminds me in many ways of Jack Reacher in Lee Child's books (these 2 are my favorite authors).<br /><br />Worth the read.  Fast paced and Baldacci scrambles the plot well enough to make it hard to determine the outcome.
B005JE7WKI|3.0|It had several interesting plot twists but wasn't always that funny. It could have had a lot more action and a faster moving plot.
0345803485|1.0|Zero depth, zero plot and unbelievably repetitive. A friend handed this book to me saying it was steamy, then I turned the book over and saw the adult content warning. There are better sex scenes in non-erotica books. I did read the entire book (speed reading and skipping through the sex contract and other bits), it was all I had with me on the plane and I kept thinking there must be something \\"more\\" to this. It is on the NYT best sellers list. \\"I want more,\\" the Ana character keeps saying. And I must agree with her, I want more too and am not looking to this author for it. Don't waste your money or time.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is book one of the trilogy and they were all awesome!  Be prepared though ... it's a little dark, the characters are unusual (to say the least), and it gets a little gory but not in a bad way.  I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and the two other books in that series just prior to the Hunger Games and, if you read them and liked them, you're bound to like this trilogy.  I also saw the movie Hunger Games) just after finishing the trilogy and found it a little bit of a let down - maybe because I saw it after reading the books.  Might've enjoyed it more as a stand-alone - without the book.  (The book just has so many details that were missed in the movie - plus I'd read the other two and knew where it went from there.)  Bottom line - this is a great read!  I hope you enjoy it half as much as I did!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a nice change to the others like this. You don't have to spend actual real money. It truly is FREE. You can play &amp; have fun without spending money. Thank you!!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|This game was a real disappointment. Have played other G5 games and enjoyed them,  but this one was terrible:<br /><br />1. The settings all looked pretty much alike - each room looked like a pile of junk.<br />2.  The same exact items were used in the different rooms so finding them was a bore.<br />3.  The challenges were really difficult to see,  such as those where the items to be found were silhouettes without any color or real definition.<br />4. There were only 3 different type of mini /games and in 2 of the 3, I never understood how these should be played - so after trying to solve the first few,  I just skipped  the rest.<br />5. Although the hype for the game claimed 50 plus rooms,  there were actually only about 5 or 6 that the game kept reusing - what a bore!<br />6. The story line might have been good,  but was manipulated so that the play stayed in one location for several rounds and always used the same silly challenges - find the silhouetted objects,  find the transparent objects,  find the list of items and so-on.<br />7. Lastly,  the graphics were poor and the settings could not be enlarged enough to be clearly seen.<br /><br />Finally,  I really felt cheated by having paid for such a crappy game.
B004I744AS|5.0|The ONLY complaint I have is that one HAS TO be connected to the Internet to take full advantage of the app. Than, sky is the limit. You WILL find the answer you're looking for.<br />On top of it,  you will get the content of the opening page. New every day, with quotes, articles of a day, and other interesting stuff.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Needless to say, The Hunger Games, as a story, totally can suck you in. It has the romantic angst to appeal to girls and young women and the sci-fi elements and violence to appeal to guys. It also has a very topical political angle. The problem was with the digital edition itself: it would not remember where my bookmark was and each time I went to read it, I had to manually find where I last left off reading it. There are no page numbers, only a \\"location number,\\" so I had to use a Note app to write down the location number every time I stopped reading so that I could find that page later. It was extremely annoying. But I loved the books, especially the final one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game verybfun and entertaing. I wish I could playbthis game all day. It is awesome great awesome fun great
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This trilogy should be read in order and I enjoyed this final book - but just not quite as much as the first 2. I again found the characterizations, humor, mystery and romance wonderful however, and maybe its because I read all three books in succession, I found the sex repetitious in this third book. I also found the end a little disappointing, not because it seemed to hang but because it seemed to keep on \\"ending\\".  I got the feeling that the author had many ideas for the final chapter and couldn't decide which to use, so she used them all. The ending was ultimately anticlimactic.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|W.E. is an excellent drama about two parallel stories with similar themes.  Wally Winthrop is an upper class wife of a blue blooded psychiatrist in Manhattan who feels trapped in her loveless and abusive marriage in 1998.  She was named after Wallis Simpson whose scandalous romance with the future King of England Edward VIII rocked 1930's England when he decided to give up the throne for the love of this woman and to marry her. Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward (W.E.) when their belongings are auctioned at Sotheby's.  The two stories transition back and forth between the two Wallys and one of the main questions in the story is what defines true love and what does one have to sacrifice for true love if it's found?  Why would King Edward give up being king and an entire country for a woman?  What did Wallis Simpson give up to be with the king and spent the rest of her life hated by the press and ostracized by so many?  Madonna wrote a very original and unique script and did an excellent job as director.  The sense of period is precise and every detail is right, even the fact that Wallis Simpson was left handed, now that's detailed precision!  The look of the film and production values and cinematography are beautiful and top notch and the musical score is excellent and appropriate for setting the mood.  There is a bonus documentary about 20 minutes long about the making of the film with interviews with the actors and crew and Madonna.
B00138EYG4|1.0|generic songs, cheezy lyrics, stereotypical in every way. Priest initially invented the heavier aspects of metal in the late 70s early 80s...had their last truely creative and heaviest album in 1984 (defenders of the faith)...after that they took 2 years off. They saw the trends in metal change to bonjovi,poison,etc...so they copied that formula for turbo and ram it down purely to sell records. most fans didnt accept that. After that, they decided, well then lets go back to being heavier...but by the late 80s heavier was slayer, anthrax, etc. So they copied that formula as well. But once again it's so phony and generic, just to sell records. Bottom line is they sold out after 84's defenders album, and priest ceased to be priest after that.
0393088774|5.0|Professor Paul Krugman explains what needs to be done in order to propel the US economy from our current doldrums. An erudite and experienced economist, part of the \\"Saltwater School of Economics,\\" Dr. Krugman is a post-Keynesian theorist (IS/LM Model) and argues for monetary and fiscal interventions by the government to help stimulate the economy. Someone who criticizes both parties, such as his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the prominent roles the two played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed Great Depression era safeguards preventing commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging. He has also criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy, and argued that the banking rescue plan was misdirected. Krugman also has said that an overwhelming majority of the American public believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions, and that the administration's money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital. In particular, he considered the Obama administration's actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers. Krugman espouses words of wisdom for both parties. Read Krugman's book, and the new book called the \\"The Rainforest\\" by Hwang and Horowitt, and you'll understand many of the actions required by the USA to revamp our economy. Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, Paul Ryan, and the Tea Party are so off-base, and should read something other than the CliffNotes of Ayn Rand's ethics of greed works. Try Paul Krugman.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game only problem is that I can't do the update that I need but customer service was great.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I do really like this app.  It is convenient and with a stylus or without it is easy to make quick notes.  I am a good typist but using the virtual keyboard can be a pain especially when you are just making a quick note.  Handwritten Note Pro works great on my Kindle Firs and my Galaxy Tab.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|sweeeeet this game is awesome and I love playing it all the time. all day every day I love this freaking game
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book had a good level of suspense to keep me interested.  I couldn't put it down and read it very quickly.  However, once I got towards the climax it started to move too fast and seemed to tie up too neatly.  But, overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to someone who wants something easy to read and entertaining without any deep thought or complexity.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|There is a severe gap between the end of the 4th season and the start of the 5th season. David Tennant is still the Doctor at the end of the 4th season, and Matt Smith is the new Doctor at the beginning of the 5th season. In order to see the transition from one to the next, I had to find the Christmas Special episode with David Tennant. Why it couldn't be part of the 4th season DVD collection is beyond me.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|I really like southern rock and I find Lady Antebellum's voice is beautiful and the harmonies are really together. I also like the band is not afraid to use classic country fold instruments like mandolins and fiddles. Yes, it does have a modern feel to it in beat, but it also has a great traditional bluegrass echo that is great. Of course, \\"We Own the Night\\" is played all over the place and rightfully so. A great album.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I Loved David Leroth in the 1st few Albums, And I did Like Sammy Hagar. however i stopped listening after that, they got kind of hard, tried things new i guess i didnt get along with the music. But this is OK. It is new, you might have to listen to it a few times. it will grow on you!!!
B001IMFHTS|2.0|An otherwise great performance can't be appreciated because of poor sound quality. The overall tone is harsh throughout making soft passages thin and louder passages clipped.  Bass extension is essentially absent, robbing the performance of an important sense of depth. Lastly, in a time when DTS and Dolby surround mix can realistically expand the sound stage and envelop the listener, this mix seems to merely reproduce the front channels and add nothing to the experience. Certainly there are other top-level performances that are technically enjoyable as well?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was better than book two in the series but required a lot of suspension of disbelief. Overall I enjoyed all three books, but they definitely went downhill along the way.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I picked these up after my [[ASIN:B002YNRT5A Creative Sound Blaster World of Warcraft USB Headset]] broke. Check out my review of that headset for a comparison point on durability. This headset does not have that problem. The earphones are attached to the overhead strap via a sturdy hinge so they fit flush to the side of your head, even if you have a narrow noggin.<br /><br />It is worth noting that I picked up these headphones on sale for 21 bucks, making them an incredible value for the money. They have good sound all through the spectrum and my Ventrilo and Skype conversations with the mic are echo-free. These are NOT USB headphones, so you're going to need a mic and headphone jack on your device in order to take advantage of the voice aspect. The cord is thick and sturdy, so you don't have to worry about ripping it out of the headset through reasonable use. (Sorry, Counter-Strike players... you still can't huck these across the room and expect them to survive.)<br /><br />My one complaint(and it's a nit-picky one at best) is the rotary volume control on the cord. I bump it with my arm and turn the sound up very high or very low sometimes.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|This was my third book to read by Agatha Christie, and I must say that this one had the best ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic mystery novels.  It is definitely a deal for the price.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have enjoyed it so far. I really liked the photo enhancement. feature.  l wish it was interchangeable with my phone then I could upload my camera shoots.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Amazon makes Moseley all file apps make you pay its not fair I can't even get the shark dash because its a dollar its just not fair.
0399224459|4.0|This book was in good shape a little rip, but not noticeable, I would recommend this book to all teachers and mothers, book was sent out in good time...
0439023513|3.0|I almost stopped reading it at several places, thinking it was (1) very poorly written, and (2) just plain annoying with regard to Katnisses character. I guess good reading for 14-16-year old girls, but for anyone else just OK, if not less. Liked \\"Catching Fire\\" better, where there was an actual plot, and only read the latter because I saw the movie.
0345803485|1.0|I really don't understand how this book is a best seller.  I couldn't wait to be done and never see or read this book, Ana, or Christian Grey again. The writing was childlike and I was disguisted with all the \\"Oh My\\" WTH?  And the sex scenes, I have never been so bored.  I have read better sex scenes in Historical Romance novels.  And that is sad.  I am a little annoyed with the girl who recommended it and I will never listen to her again.
0307951529|5.0|I read Chris Gullebeau's first book The Art of Non-Conformity in about 3 days, couldn't put it down and it definitely spoke to me.  Chris speaks of doing things outside the norm of society and doing what's not necessarily popular but rather what makes us happy, what we are passionate about.  In his second book he really gets to the heart of the issue as he's interviewed 100s of entrepreneurs that did just that and made their passion a business, sometimes by accident, and all started for less than $100.<br /><br />If you're an entrepreneurial spirit already you'll connect with this book.  If you've considered it but like your safe job and think it's too risky - this book may be for you.  The term safe doesn't even apply to most jobs any more and they only way to truly take charge is to create your own income.  It's only risky if you don't know what you're getting into or put up a lot of money - this book gives example after example of how to do it without a lot of money to get going.  You risk only your time, you get out what you put in.<br /><br />I'm hoping to connect with Chris on his book tour, but buy this book, heck buy 10 and give them away as gifts!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is super fun;) I love the little movies it shows at the theater:) I recommend this game for anyone in any age group...
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Thank u. Amazon.<br />Exactly what I was looking for,  A simple Drawing Pad that has all the tools my son likes to draw with. Hassle free. I love it.

B005T87QCI|5.0|Too Cool.  I enjoyed the movie and the game is neat. My son loves to be able to play the game on my KINDLE.  Thank u. AMAZON
0307951529|5.0|Chris writes about his experience and also interviews a ton of successful people. He has good criteria for including them in the book and doesn't just write about ideas that seem good. These have actually worked.<br /><br />It's one thing to take an idea and make it successful of course, and it's another to actually find what you were made to do and then go do that. Chris talks about finding the right idea for you and not just picking from a list.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a great book for getting your brain working and finding an idea that fits you. Buy it.
B006WPSQVC|1.0|Insulting, condesending, preachy. Painful to watch, avoid at all costs. So bad I could only watch the first 30 minutes even though I was stuck on an airplane.
B0063IH60K|4.0|not too bad. I play it all the time. the play is fair and the the graphics are that bad etheir.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can usually filter with the sample, but this piece of middle school garbage snuck by.  It worries me that anyone foumd it the least bit appealling after the first five chapters.  It's cheap porn.  Walk away.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|Works Great on my Epic Touch. Great game works great and have not had any problems yet. The graphics of characters I find unnecessary, but they don't take away from the game.
0307352145|4.0|As an introverted person, I found myself on every page of this book.  Reasons why I'm wired the way that I am, insights into why I often feel the way I feel, and even hope for how to make the most of opportunities and relationships in my life.<br /><br />Susan Cain begins with the premise that there is a cultural bias that favors extroverted personality types and looks over introverted personality types.  Anyone that is introverted can and will relate to that premise.  Cain then dissects the physiological, psychological, and sociological implications of being introverted.  She is pretty honest about the pro's and con's that come with being an introvert.  The emphasis of the book is to empower introverts to excel in spite of cultural biases against them and to encourage extroverts to rethink their perceptions of introverts.<br /><br />The one area I would take exception with the author was in her portrayal of Saddleback Church in Southern California beginning on page 64.  With a congregation of 20,000 people, I would say it is over shooting the mark to assume that the introverts in the congregation are participating in worship service at the expense of their introverted tendencies.  Surely, introverted people are smart enough to attend a church that they feel is meeting their spiritual needs whether it is a church of 20,000 or 20.  No one is making introverts attend a church like Saddleback.  They are attending because they choose to attend.<br /><br />I would especially recommend this book to the introverts out there that have struggled finding their place in society, especially in the context of employment.  It offers some great encouragement and perhaps gives us permission to excel in the ways in which we are uniquely wired.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B007SGM084|5.0|very sexy and addictive... you're not reading this for it's academic merit, just enjoy it and look past the flaws. The characters are actually complex. Enjoy the fantasy.
B006ON41FC|5.0|As well as plants vs zombies as good as temple run fun spunky and epic rad squirrely and back to nature kid of app
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great read and very enveloping, I read to get lost and enjoy, this trilogy delivers. The movie was good, but did not do the book justice. Enjoy the rich characters and descriptions of the food before and after the Hunger Games.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|As some have mentioned, suddenly all the crops and buildings show huge amounts of time left, along the order of weeks. Yuck. It's fun when it works. Now it's become too unreliable to play.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|This movie at first comes off as a bit like many others before it.  Think Sixth Sense, Leonardo Dicaprio Shutter Island, and other movies of \\"I See Dead People\\" theme. However, this movie genuinely kept me guessing, and I have to say I was impressed and felt it was worth watching.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the fact that I can listen to the Bible plan. I work as a cleaner late nights so being able to hear the word of God is a blessing
B007NZDES0|5.0|I was a little down because I missed the show in Charlotte NC only to find out she was going to be here in Greensboro. I don't think I will ever witness another concert that will top this one!! We got free upgraded seats which made it even better. I enjoyed John Legend but I was waiting all of my adult life to finally see this band live and it was one of the best nights of my life. Certainly something I checked off of my bucket list. The band is awesome, Sades voice is like smooth warm silk and the visuals were breath taking! I am excited about this release!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is relly fun and if you open your eyes it is easy to exit you touch the little paw then potions and it bottem bar comes up

B000BT97AO|5.0|I'm a big fan of this quirky movie. The mood and imagery are impressive. Great quotes throughout. Neil Gaiman's work can be hit-or-miss with me. This one is a hit.
1439177783|5.0|This book was very good. I couldn't put it down. It details the struggles that celebrities Go through in their own daily lives.
0439023521|5.0|THIS WAS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE WHO SAW THE MOVIE FIRST.....HE LOVED IT AND COULD PUT FACES ON THE CHARACTERS AS HE READ.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this series. It is more than \\"mom porn\\"  It's an erotic love story, the growth of a relationship. A relationship starts from a contract arrangement to a romance. Makes me wish my man was this loving, attentive, protective and desired me as much as Christian does Ana.
0345803485|5.0|Just an amazing trilogy.. I could not stop reading. Highly recommend anyone to read all three books. For me the story was very original. A True Original Story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Haven't  stop playing. love the animation and carters. My kids also like to play the games that are on the app. Don't stop adding fun stuff!!
0345803485|5.0|Love that there is a book out there for women!  Love it & buying the other books today so I won't be without any when I am done with the first!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Bryan Cranston is absolutely amazing as Walter White, a loving family man stricken with terminal cancer. In a desperate attempt to provide financial security for his family, the chemistry teacher joins forces with a former student Jesse to make the best quality meth lab around.<br />This is a very stylized story driven by the number of odd and quirky characters that surround Walter. His pregnant wife Skyler knows Walter has a secret but what could it be? Add in Walter's streetwise brother-in-law who is a DEA agent, and there is quite a story here.<br />Jesse, the low level drug dealer, and conservative and proper Walter become allies and unwilling friends in a world of violence and murder. Somehow a story about two drug dealers becomes a fascinating study of human nature and a fight between good and bad. Meth dealers as heroes of a show? Somehow it works mainly because we only see the \\"bad\\" guys in this scenario - not the addicted buyers of the meth.<br />Be ready for a high level of violence. Somehow Walter and Jesse stay ahead of the law and fellow drug dealers. A simple idea to make money becomes a life-threatening career that probably can only end in disaster and destruction.<br />The writing is incredible as we follow the twists and turns of Walter's life. The obvious is never what it seems and somehow we believe it all and crave for more.<br />Cranston is at his absolute best as the cancer-striken chemistry teacher in for the fight of his life on many levels. Cranston's appearance and demeanor changes as he progresses through chemo and his new life as a criminal.<br />It's all absolutely amazing.
B007SGM084|5.0|Want to read the trilogy of 50 grey soooo much, but I won't pay 29.99 for a download.  I'll get the paper book at Target.  Amazon, please don't make me regret investing in a Kindle Fire.  I don't want to drag 20 lbs of books for my vacation on the beach!  LOWER THESE PRICES!  Shame to you.
1400069289|3.0|This book has some enjoyable anecdotes, and is kind of a fun, breezy read.  It's possible that it may change your life in a positive way.<br /><br />But there's really nothing new here.  The author has rewrapped behaviorist ideas into a new package.  He relies on a cultural amnesia -- perhaps most readers are not familiar with basic behavioral principles -- and subsumes many concepts under the umbrella of \\"habit\\".<br /><br />How did the Tampa Bay Buccaneers go from zero to hero?  Habit, of course.  Why is toothpaste foamy?  Habit.  Why does AA work?  Habit.  In a really interesting story, a new concept would shed light on past phenomena, but in this case it's a *really* well-known concept that's being recycled in some way.  It's the same old story, compelling because there's truth in it, but no new insights.<br /><br />The alchemy he uses dresses up old ideas as \\"new, revolutionary science\\" with excited, proactive prose.  He doesn't quite have the gift of balancing content and style of a Malcolm Gladwell.  Part of this is the topic -- no matter how he sells it, it's not new or counterintuitive in an interesting way -- and part of it is the way that journalists rarely understand the real science and its implications.  After all, their job is to craft an interesting story, something that scientists often struggle with because the actual data is less willing to lend itself in such a way.
1609613937|5.0|Dr. John McDougall has been quietly saving lives for years. A visit to his website, under the category of \\"Star McDougallers,\\" stories of patients and readers will tell you in their own words, how their lives have been saved eating this kind of diet. Many of them have tried to figure out why so many doctors and so-called health gurus don't give you this painless, cheap alternative to heart surgery, insulin for diabetes, bariatric surgery and fill-in-the-blank surgery and drugs used for preventable diseases.<br /><br />Dr. McDougall has remained courageous and eloquent in treating patients and truly follows the Hippocratic oath, \\"Do no harm.\\" More than that, he has brought many patients back from the dead and has inspired a generation of doctors and health care professionals who simply want untainted, unadulterated truth. When you understand, as Dr. McDougall does, that there is no money in broccoli, then you understand why it is so important to seek out doctors like him who are not bought off, bribed or otherwise coerced into handing you a pill or a device in 10 minutes saying, \\"Call me in the morning.\\"<br /><br />He and his wife Mary, continue their legendary tradition and trails of delicious recipes which are btw, also way cheaper than a burger, a bypass or bariatrics, no matter who pays for it. Genes don't determine destiny. But you do have to be your own investigative reporter.<br /><br />--Former 2X Emmy-winning TV investigative reporter for 18 years who almost died of a colon blockage and whose mom, aunt & both sisters had breast cancer. And way more. (Now I place in 5K races, ran 1st marathon 2 years ago-5th oldest female to finish Palm Beaches Marathon. Go figure!)
081297381X|2.0|It's a bit hard to get through the pretensions of the author to find and evaluate his ideas objectively.  Taleb basically comes off as a colossal a** in this book; a man who sees other individuals in the world in horribly condescending ways.  Europeans are all nothing but snobby Goethe readers, and Taleb is enlightened enough to notice how delightfully creative Americans are, and that these Europeans have the gall to listen to ipods and wear jeans.  Clueless academics live in their ivory towers, utterly oblivious to the external world.  All of them (except, of course, Umberto Eco).<br /><br />Never mind that Taleb's fantasy is that he has found a life of meditative contemplation, free from the distractions of humanity, to engage in pure thought.  Though there are antecedents to every one of his ideas, he seems to genuinely believe that his thought process is wholly original.  He has meditated his way into the fundamental nature of reality, and it is this:  we can't predict anything.<br /><br />Taleb, of course, has experience in the stock market, and seems to be a pretty talented quant.  The problem is that the lens of the stock market does not work for everything.  It's kind of a petty truth to say that we can't predict the future with great accuracy (who genuinely thinks we can?), and there's a little more to what he's saying here, but less than people seem to have taken to heart from this book.  The eponymous \\"black swan\\" has been cultivated into an idea, but it's not easy to see what predictive value this has.  If you can work past the endless condescending references to Taleb's life story and philosophies, you might find something of value.  But you may not.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|it sounds silly but this book made me go back in time. intensity of the first love so foolishly in love so in love.  it made my heart flutter .
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I have to admit, I don't know all the comic characters involved in this movie, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the story.  Several character, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America had some very funny lines.  I think the characters were cast to perfection and each of them played off the other perfectly. I like how the movie showed them coming together as a team and not being perfect when that happened. Emotions, egos got in the way, but in the end it all worked out. Not to mention all the butt kicking that happens eventually. I hope they make a sequel to this movie so we can see how the Avengers work together without all the character development involved that came with this movie.
0486274268|5.0|I accidentally purchased this book thinking it was another one I was interested in buying. Upon it's arrival, I realized this book was definitely not the book I thought it was; it was even better! So many illustrations that really help artists capture the movement of animals. I love this book, and even appreciated that caricature section. Great book!
0307951529|5.0|I truly believe that entrepreneurship is our generation's way of rebelling against the system. Instead of being hippies or listening to rock and roll, we are out there creating rocking alternative businesses that change the world and support our lifestyles. That's exactly what Chris Guillebeau is teaching in The $100 Startup, and he's definitely a leader in the field of reinventing the way you make your living.<br /><br />What I loved most about this book is the examples. Theory is great and all, but seeing exactly how other people have built their small and powerful life changing businesses from the ground up is priceless. When you see someone else do something incredible, it plants the seed for your own incredible actions. There are so many great examples of really different businesses and people from different age groups and backgrounds, it really shows how possible it is to get started in business.<br /><br />Beyond the inspiring stories, Chris lays down the law with really practical and actionable step by step recommendations for finding a business model that's profitable from the get-go. If you're just starting out in business, or you're curious about entrepreneurship... or you've fallen out of love with your efforts to get your business to grow - this is the book that's going to make the difference for you.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these little phones since I discovered them many years ago. They are so lightweight and the sound is outstanding for their category. If they cost $29.99 they'd still be a deal. At $7 bucks they're a steal.<br /><br />These are great for general listening (MP3) or for movies or TV off the laptop. They are so light you don't even know they're on your head, and because they are open, they don't irritate the insides of your ears like earbuds. You can also hear other noise in the room if it's loud enough, which is handy if you want to be able to hear someone call, catch the phone ringing, or whatever.<br /><br />The range if these phones is terrific as so many in the category are either tinny from too much high-end, muddy from reproducing bass poorly, or they lack mid-range all together. Not so with these little Sonys. They out-perform themselves by delivering clean sound across all frequencies.<br /><br />No small-diameter earphone is going to be able to reproduce bass-rattling low frequencies like a woofer or external speak does, or even a larger, standard studio style headphone. But for everyday use there is nothing to beat them, or even come close. They will promptly become your favorite digital headphones.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of Dec 2, 2013 the price on these is $64.99!!!! I have been buying these headphones for at least 10 yrs, have owned 4 pairs, and I paid $5.99 - $7.00!!!! The model number is still the same exact model number I bought from Amazon (that this review was based on) that I paid $7 for. That's just a rip off. If they could make a profit for so many years at $7... now to jump to $64??? I will never buy them again unless this is some kind of typo!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game could be fun if they would fix the glitches of losing all energy and having timers go to unrealistic amounts for absolutely no reason at all. until they fix it I would not get this game again. not fun when the game is not playable for long periods of time.
B007SGM084|1.0|I too really want to read this on my kindle but too expensive for a download. That's just crazy! I guess I will have to wait until all the hype dies down and then maybe they will lower the kindle price. I hope.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game. Great graphics, cute storyline. But, I can't visit any of my friends. I can see them, but I get a message telling me to restart for an update. Also, I haven't gotten any special prizes since the very first time I played the mini game. I am disappointed because I thought it would be a way to get animals that cost acorns.
B004SYP5WC|1.0|Every month the program decides to change a monthly payment to daily. Developer is absolutely no help. Cannot recommend this app, even if it were free.
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVED this trilogy!!!  I was a little skeptical when I started the book; I wasn't sure I wanted to read about some of the things going on, but soon fell in love with the characters.  I couldn't put the book down.  It's been a while since I've been that in love with a book.<br />I do agree that the Kindle version shouldn't cost as much as the hard copy.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It would be a great game if it weren't for the glitches. I really enjoyed playing at first. Then I kept getting the glitches on my buildings. At first it was only 20-30 hours, now it went to 377 hours. So I deleted it. I hope they read these reviews and fix the problems.
B004S3096K|5.0|Excellent story line and I like very much Martin's writing style.  I believe this first book of five in the series basically introduces the storyline and the characters and leaves you not wanting the 807 page book to end.  Have the next book ready to start if you choose to read this series.
0307951529|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, it's that good. The book's main theme is about finding work that gives you freedom and add's value to your life. The book is so appealing because it features stories of real life people who are making it doing work that gives them freedom and value. They are people like you and I who didn't have a lot of money to start their businesses (hence the title of the book) but found a way to persevere and make it work.<br /><br />Their stories are so inspiring because they give you and me hope that we can do it. I love the fact that the income from these stories ranges from $50,000 to $300,000, totally attainable numbers. Reading their stories alone is worth the price of the book.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|Yes. It is expensive but...<br /><br />It makes your camera feel oh so right. Beyond the comfort factor your battery life also doubles either through the addition of another EN-EL 15 or 8 AA batteries. There is also an option to use the Nikon D4's battery, the EN-EL 18, but you must first purchase the BL-5 battery cover (of course it's sold separately right?!). By the way, a soft Nikon case is included to store one of the battery trays when not in use. The grip has good weight and feels as though it genuinely belongs on your camera. The shutter button is responsive and you will feel right at home with the rest of the controls as well. In my opinion this is an essential accessory for the professional photographer and it would have been ideal if Nikon just built it onto the body of the D800 from the start. However, I suppose then the differences between the flagship of the Nikon line, the D4, and the D800 would be diminished which would be a poor business move. It would also be nice if Nikon engineered the battery grip to house two EN-EL 15 batteries as opposed to one so that you wouldn't have to remove the battery grip every time you needed to recharge the battery located inside the camera. Maybe there is another reason this is not a feature although it can be done and I appreciated the convenience it afforded on the Canon 7D.<br /><br />You could wait for a generic version, you could wait for Nikon to lower the price, but we all know life is short and those two options are just not as much fun.<br /><br />This item deserves 5 stars.<br />The price deserves 2.3 stars.
0316236535|4.0|The kids in my classroom at the day care I work at LOVE this book, they have been obsessed with \\"monsters\\" and I knew of this book from a previous center. The book is a way cute, cut out picture book that builds the monster up and then breaks him apart to tell him to go away.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there are two seperate pages that there are doubles of... the kids caught on right away. \\"WE ALREADY READ THAT PAGE!\\" They just didn't understand that it was printed twice and not me trying to re-read the page.
006197806X|4.0|MAJOR SPOILERS FOR DELIRIUM!<br /><br />Lena can't believe what she's just survived. But did she really survive? And if she did, then where is Alex? They were together & now they're not & she's stumbling through the Wilds. After being rescued from what would have surely been her death, Lena finds herself among the \\"invalids\\" fighting alongside them for survival.<br /><br />It's not exactly what Alex described, not really anyway, since she's in a different part with different people. As her strength returns she begins to explore her new home with people like Blue, Raven & Hunter. Soon enough though it's time to move for the season, but nothing goes as smoothly as it should.<br /><br />Oscillating between a \\"Then\\" time period in the Wilds & a \\"Now\\" time period back in the city working for the resistance by infiltrating a loyalist group, Pandemonium offers the absolute best of Delirium with a hint of awesome! While most second novels in a trilogy (or any series for that matter) tend to fall down a dark, sad hole where nothing important seems to take place, this book is the antithesis of that state. We learn so much more about the society that the characters inhabit & what exactly is going on in the Wilds.<br /><br />But just when you think you've got things figured out & squared away into their neat little packages, Lauren Oliver throws you a nasty curve ball. I hope you enjoy curve balls because there's no avoiding this one & I honestly didn't see it coming. Take your time reading this book. There is a lot going on that you need to pay attention to & a lot of emotions being thrown all over the place. It kept me on my toes & has me primed for the final installment.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is borderline pornographic and concerns me that all ages will have access to it. The book bears no relevance to the media reviews I had read of it likening it to an adult \\"Twilight\\". It was poorly written, characters not fully fleshed, poor story line , just an excuse to write porno . I am concerned that making such books mainstream will make the infliction of pain on women more acceptable and I consider this book a backward step for womens rights. It is not a book that I would recommend and in fact have told people to steer clear of it. I am no prude but consider the subject matter inappropriate.
1616642890|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />Their explanation of the Atkins approach was so thorough and empathetic that I felt like the authors were holding my hand and showing me the mines before I stepped on them, and the gold at the end of the rainbow too. Much appreciated!<br /><br />If you are new to Atkins this is a very valuable book - it really walks you through from A to Z.<br /><br />If you thought you were familiar with Atkins, you will find that the in-depth practical advice here moves your understanding up to a new level.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />They call everything Atkins rather than low carb, so i assume immediately this is paid somehow by Atkins.com. That sets me on guard right off the bat. I'd prefer my diet advisors not to have hidden agendas. They hawk Atkins bars at every opportunity when discussing snacks.<br /><br />They say limit your sweeteners to three packs daily because they contain carbs. But they make no mention that you can find liquid and tab forms that have far less, essentially zero carbs in them. Why deny us zero carb pleasures that keep us away from the sugary sweets? They don't say why.<br /><br />All in all though it's a great guide to low carbing.

B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This was the 3rd book in an excellently written series. Although, it was marketed to young adults; as a grandmother, I loved the books. I actually liked them better than the Twilight series.  They are the kind of books you would enjoy reading a 2nd time.
B000FA5STS|5.0|David Baldacci is a fairly new author to me, but you can bet he won't be for long.  My only regret is he doesn't write faster!  He is now totally up there with my other favorites, Patterson, Kellerman, Koontz, Cornwell, King.........well suffice to say I am now expanding my GREATS!<br /><br />Kathy
0316044695|5.0|Once I started reading, I could not put this book down.  In fact, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire book.  And once I was finished, the story lingered with me for days.  A very powerful and moving read- highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Unless, you get the Hunger Games trilogy from the start, it will really be necessary to read the subsequent books to get a full grasp of the entire story.  While the main thrust of the all three books surround the Hunger Games, there is much more to the story than just the Hunger Games itself.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins takes you on a rollercoster ride of suspense, thriller, and emotions.  All I can say is, the Hunger Games trilogy turned me into a speed reader, because I wanted to find out more about the characters and their fate.<br /><br />The books are rated for children to young adults.  I believe it is good reading for most age ranges.  Most of the people I spoke with regarding the Hunger Games were over 40.<br /><br />One other thought!  A few people that I spoke with regarding Catching Fire and the Mockingjay felt these stories weren't as good the Hunger Games.  I truly disagree.  I felt that each book was as good as the first.  But remember, each story is slightly different, and they are building blocks for the entire trilogy.<br /><br />I would and have already recommend all three books.  If you haven't read the Hunger games yet, then get the trilogy.  It is truly worth it.  Don't treat each book as individual stories.  It really is one book cut into three parts.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was awe inspiring. The authors ability to take the fabulous & wise words of the Avert Bothers & integrate them into a fantastic read gives a 2 thumbs up!!  I loved the characters and after reading this a few months ago I'm still talking about it to friends.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|I heard Willie Dixon for the first time on channel 978 of Dish Network TV.  Really enjoy this CD.  Let's your mind drift off into fond memories.
0553801473|4.0|(I am Hungarian, excuse my English)<br /><br />I checked some reviews down there and it appears that GRRM's latest dance with dragons has been received with mixed feelings. Well, my two cents go to GRRM, I say this book is great, as great as any of his works -- it's just slightly different. To my taste, these changes may even lift the book above the other sequels. I saw complaints about slow storytelling, uncharacteristic characters, and even, horribile dictu, boredom. I don't want to - since I can't - measure out justice in the case, fantasy is not an objectively measurable genre, nonetheless, I would remind readers about two points that might be worth considering while assessing this book.<br /><br />* The Ice and Fire saga moves a vast number of characters around the board. I imagine it is quite some challege for the author to balance between expectations of readers who yearn for action-packed, intricate stories and of those who wish to see characters grow, develop, process - or just simply react to - events. Work on details or move ahead, might GRRM ask himself day by day. I think he did a fairly good job. Lots of things are going on, and we see characters change. Thoroughly. Or die. Latter one a trade mark of GRRM.<br /><br />* (spoilers follow) What happened to Tyrion, a giant spirit in dwarf body, so that he lets fate drag him around, mostly against his will, to random places, or seemingly nowhere in particular? What hit the Kingslayer so that he often broods, pats people on the shoulder, saves ugly maidens, forgives insults and makes peace instead of war? I am telling you. They are subject to GRRMs world order. A prince is prince in his own realm, yes. And becomes a slave or game piece if extracted from his fortified settings. Looses vigour when aging, loosing his sword hand, or facing the fact that his paramour twin cheats him and makes efforts to ruin their whole lineage. It is a game of thrones, man, get over it. Would it be more amusing to follow the \\"traditional\\" pattern? Deus ex machina tricks and cheap shortcuts? I don't think so. Gods are dead in GRRM's realm. They don't rush out and save you with flaming swords and mirror-polished armors. One of the reasons I like GRRM's world is that wounds hurt, characters pay the price of their follies. No one plays the game of thrones in god mode.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I am desperately waiting for the next book and pray for good healt to GRRM so that we can enjoy his books in abundance for the foreseeable future.
1400069289|5.0|one of the best books i have read in awhile. this book reminded me why i love to read and has renewed a love of reading in my life. the stories are wonderfully crafted weaving in and out of eachother. i love how the author goes back and forth between two or more stories and real life examples. wonderfully entertaining. can't put it down.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Epic! I loved every single minute of this movie. It's just plain fun. For me, entertainment is what movies are all about and this movie highly succeeded at doing just that. It's the perfect mix of comedy and action. The entire cast did a fantastic job and you could tell they were having the time of their lives while filming the movie. For me, the only way this movie could have been better is if Liam Neeson had played a role in it. Hopefully I'll get my wish in the sequel =). Anyway, if you get the chance, I strongly recommend seeing it at an IMAX Theater, it is totally worth the price of admission.
0345803485|5.0|This book is the most sensual and passionate book I have read. As a woman, it makes you feel sexy and confident.<br /><br />Christian Grey is an alpha male with an insatiable taste for passion/love making/sex ( whatever you want to call it ); he's very desirable and HOT, in your minds eye reading the book as it describes him, his body, and his sensual language. He meets Anastasia, a shy, timid, young woman, whom he brings out of her shell so to speak. From the first time meeting him, she's indescribably attracted to him; this unbelievable attraction is transfered through the pages to the reader, making him the fantasy of the reader.<br /><br />The book is hard to put down from the first page. It's a pretty accurate account of how woman think, feel, and talk to themselves when in the midst of a relationship. Thus, it's from the woman's perspective; which makes it all the more intensively hot.<br /><br />I definetly recommend the book for everyone; it will slightly satisfy the extremely sexual woman and, maybe, help bring out any shy, timid woman.
B000W1V5OC|5.0|this was on time and nicely packaged, My wife very much enjoyed her Christmas present. WWWWoooooooo HHHHoooooo<br />gotta add a few more words to reviews?
0307951529|5.0|If you have ever thought about entrepreneurship, then this book is for you.  However, for those who get overwhelmed thinking about handling millions of dollars in revenue, dozens of employees, and risking so much there is an alternative that Chris talks about in this book--microbusinesses.  I love that the emphasis is on being simple and effective--ideas do not need to be grandiose and complicated.  Chris gives us case study after case study of real world entrepreneurs--these folks come from all walks of life and the bottom line is that no one has an excuse to not get started.  Additionally, he has some useful lists covering topics such as the product launch.  As someone who recently made my first little bit of money online, it is truly liberating!
0767847431|4.0|Here is a little, smart and funny fantasy movie, inspired by the classic Arabian tale of Sinbad the Sailor.<br /><br />It has no other pretentions that to give you nice relax time with a story of a hero, a villain (and he is a real piece of art, this particular villain), some (really nasty) monsters, a (quite smart) riddle, a perilous journey, a secret island and a hot (really hot) chick in slave outfit. This is a movie you can watch alone or with your date and with your kids as well, providing there are seven years old or more.<br /><br />Special effects by Ray Harryhausen are still working well and the monsters are more credible than not - after all it is not a hasard that in &#34;Monsters, Inc&#34; Pixar bowed to his talent by naming the most famous restaurant in monster's world &#34;Harryhausen's&#34;. The bad guy (warlock prince Koura) is REALLY bad, Sinbad is quite likeable and the usual hot chick in slave outfit is VERY watchable.<br /><br />The final sword fight is quite smart and unique - because one of the fighters progressively becomes invisible... quite a nice idea. And the way the final duel ends is quite a smart surprise, even for the most hardened fan of fantasy movies. You will also probably like the goddess Kali doing a short apparition as a showgirl... well, she couldn't help it, she was stoned. You will understand this joke better in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />All in all, it is a little pleasure for a relaxing evening, with popcorn, beer - and if possible, a hot chick in slave outfit on your side.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Loved the characters and the stories.  Great actors, loved the humor.  Watched all the episodes and totally enjoyed them.  Once you start you'll want to just keep going!!
B0011UF79C|5.0|I just discovered this movie and I was very, very impressed. I simply can not understand why did \\"Gattaca\\" slipped under the radar when it was released in 1998. The 90s were not a good time for SF cinema - for a long time I considered that only three SF movies made between 1991 and 2000 were really good: \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"12 Monkeys\\" and \\"Strange days\\". Well since yesterday it is official - make it four!<br /><br />When watching this movie I had the impression to make a comeback to the great age of SF, which were the 70s, with \\"Soylent Green\\", \\"Planet of Apes\\", \\"Alien\\", \\"Westworld\\", \\"Andromeda Strain\\", \\"A clockwork orange\\", \\"Close encounters of the Third kind\\", \\"Star Wars\\", etc., a blessed time in which even \\"Star Trek\\" movies could be great (just think about the first one, \\"Star Trek: the Motion Picture\\" which opened in 1979). Making this time travel back was a really great experience.<br /><br />I like spectacular, fast paced movies and I am not really a great intellectual - but when a movie is REALLY intelligent and well done, sometimes I like them even better. And \\"Gattaca\\" is an exceptionally well thought, well conceived, well directed, well paced, well balanced and VERY well interpreted movie. It is amazing how much you can do with a modest budget if you have a brilliant scenario and a good idea how to use it, when you keep a good control over your movie and when you hire half a dozen of really excellent actors, who clearly enjoy playing much more than \\"being a star\\". The director, Andrew Niccol, managed to do all of it very well (oh, why, but why, couldn't he direct the \\"Terminal\\" rather than only writing the scenario).<br /><br />Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman gave everything they could in this movie and the result is impressive. Four other actors seconded them impressively well: Gore Vidal (yes, the writer Gore Vidal, in one of his very unfrequent appearances on the silver screen), Ernest Borgnine, one of the few survivors of Golden Age of Hollywood who is still standing, Loren Dean (an actor who for the moment didn't really make a great career, which I find a pity after watching this movie) and finally Alan Arkin, who long time ago played Yossarian in \\"Catch 22\\" and who returns here (I am CERTAIN it was made on purpose) as a REALLY smart and tenacious cop.<br /><br />I am not going to say anything on the movie itself - no spoilers. Let's just say that this is a tale about a horribly unfair society in which a member of discriminated and opressed minority will challenge the fundamental rules which govern this world. It is not gonna be easy and is gonna hurt... But you will have great time watching it.ood who is still standing, Loren Dean (an actor who for the moment didn't really make a great career, which I find a pity after watching this movie) and finally Alan Arkin, who long time ago played Yossarian in \\"Catch 22\\" and who returns here (I am CERTAIN it was made on purpose) as a REALLY smart and tenacious cop.<br /><br />I am not going to say anything on the movie itself - no spoilers.

B001TWT0AE|5.0|How come, that the secret of making movies which could be THAT good, seems to be lost? No matter how long you look, you will not find in the contemporary cinema a movie which would be so smart, funny and tragic in the same time as this one. Well, ladies and gentlemen, behold here one of the most legendary masterpieces of western - and three giants of American cinema: James Stewart, John Wayne and Lee Marvin.<br /><br />This is a highly symbolical story about the barbary being beaten away by the civilisation, the crime being reduced by law and the chaos of wilderness being replaced by order. The symbol of barbary, crime, chaos and violence is a jubilant, agressive, vile and primitiv bandit, called Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). He is so horrible that almost strangely appealing, a force of nature which can fascinate - until we actually see his victims... He will be confronted by a young lawyer (James Stewart), who came to the Far West trying to establish a law practice, but who, in a lawless town, will end washing dishes.<br /><br />Now, James Stewart was not a whimp (he actually ended the WWII as general of aviation - the only Hollywoodian actor who went as far in military) but in this movie he portrays the total opposite of Liberty Valance - he is civilised, non-violent, polite, reserved (although well spoken), in fact he seems a little dull compared to the bandit. Until the day when he grabs that gun and (still wearing an apron!) walks toward the deadly bandit...<br /><br />But the actor who is the reason for which this movie is such a masterpiece is the Duke himself - John Wayne. This is one of his most important, most complex and possibly the most tragic roles. His character represents what we have to loose when the heroic and barbaric times end - we gain civilisation, peace, law and order. But we loose also something - and although finally we get a fair deal, it is still painful. Even if you hate John Wayne, you will feel for his character in this movie - and you will be impressed by his acting.<br /><br />This movie is not linear - the story of this one gunfight and its consequences is told twice, and before that we are going from one time to another. The plot is watertight - everything falls in place at the end with the precision of a Swiss clock mechanism. And the final punchline of this partly tragic but finally very funny film will simply blow you away! This is a treasure of the world cinema - a classic to see and then see again.will be impressed by his acting.<br /><br />This movie is not linear - the story of this one gunfight and its consequences is told twice, and before that we are going from one time to another.

0307951529|5.0|This is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it. It covers real examples of people running ultra low cost enterprises, successfully, and offers a blueprint for doing the same. You will find lots of ideas, inspiration and practical advice for starting a very low cost business. It outlines several business models suitable for starting up inexpensively and shows examples of people making a great living doing the same.<br /><br />This is business for those of us who want to do what we love, on our terms, and make a profit doing so. I have been thinking of starting up for some time, but have worried about managing my time and actually running a business that will work for me. This book has given me tangible examples of people doing just that, so much so that I am about to get started on my own little consultancy business and have given myself a deadline of under a week to launch. This book breaks down the barriers to starting a business and shows you another way. If you've always thought about running a business but didn't think you had the money or time, or you want to find a way to make a living doing what you love, this book is for you.

A valuable resource for both new and baby entreprenuers!<br /><br />One of my favorite parts was his idea matrix. As someone who is easily distracted by shiny objects and has way more ideas than time, having a clear way to prioritize my projects is a godsend.<br /><br />Overall, a great resource. A fun read. Energizing and practical, it's exactly what I've come to expect from Chris.

I have had a kindle for years and know how to turn off popular highlights, but in this edition it does not work. My friend downloaded this book and has the same problem. The highlights are very distracting and are ruining my reading experience, especially since the person who did these highlights is not very insightful.

0307951529|5.0|I just finished reading the best business book of 2012. Seriously folks, if you hope to do your own thing, start your own biz, and free yourself from the chains of working for someone else, then this is the ONE book you need to invest in now (warning - I dried up one highlighter and had to go find a second highlighter, so be prepared when you dive in!).<br /><br />The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau is jam-packed with everything you need to know if you are itching to make 2012 your break-out year. With the examples, interviews, and included templates (i.e., One Page Business Plan, One Page Promotion Plan, and Thirty-Nine Step Product Launch Checklist) you will be armed and dangerous, ready to tackle the entrepreneur scene.<br /><br />The book gives you the tools to start your own business TODAY, not tomorrow or next week or next year; today. Chris brings to the table an actual tool-kit that you can simply, and easily, replicate.<br /><br />\\"This book is different, and it has two key themes: freedom and value. Freedom is what we're all looking for, and value is the way to achieve it.\\"<br /><br />The case studies that Chris uses are real people that made it happen. If they can do it, what's stopping you?

The son has adopted his dad's guitar style - so perfect and he makes it look like the easiest thing in the world.  The father holds the guitar like a baby and so does the son.  I've watched this video many times and it's always a great experience.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Requested on NetGalley<br />Overall Rating: 4.50<br />Story Rating: 4.50<br />Character Rating: 4.50<br /><br />NOTE:I don't read a lot of edgy smexy erotica/romance but this one was done so well that I finished it in one setting!<br /><br />First thought when finished: That was an intense ending that I think was very appropriate for the lead characters.<br /><br />What I Loved: Sylvia Day is one of the best writers out there when tackling intense feelings. She just knows how to draw you into her characters thoughts and actions. This is especially true with Eva! Sylvia eases you into everything that Eva is feeling by slowly vetting out who she is. Eva was just a great combo of strong/vulnerable, sassy/sweet, and guarded/hopeful. There are some amazingly intense feelings and actions in this story. You walked the edge with the characters. You weren't removed from their actions. You passionately felt for them (good or bad). I loved that those intense reactions were brought out while reading.<br /><br />What I Liked: Gideon (the leading man) was both intense and guarded. He was a bit rough in the beginning so it took a bit for me to embrace him. I liked this balance in the story. It was very real for his character to act out in this way. Each of his actions were based solely on his personality and they fit. You didn't always like him but you felt for him as he worked out his issues. I really liked that his story was organic.<br /><br />Final Thought: This was an intense read that is definitely adult material. It does not skirt very real and emotional issues. The scenes are graphic but they are not done to shock. I felt this was a very organic, well-written, and emotionally pulling story!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works well &amp; eschews unnecessary fluff.  Better than others I tried. The ads don't get in the way too much.
0439023513|2.0|Read for Fun<br />Challenges : read for fun, ya<br />Overall Rating: 2.75<br />Story Rating: 2.50<br />Character Rating: 3.00<br /><br />First Thought when Finished : Well it finally got moved off my DNF shelf.<br /><br />Different Review Approach: Let me start by saying I gave Catching Fire a 5 so please don't throw stuff at me :)<br /><br />There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. I think you either loved or hated the way things were all tied up. However there are a few of us that were just very \\"meh\\" about it. I chalk this up to my need to have a pleasant end for someone and this book just doesn't give that to us. I see no hope or joy just sadness and acceptance. Which might have been fine if I wasn't already to the point of not caring who else Suzanne Collins killed off. There is a fine line between killing characters for emotional impact and just killing. Really only 3 deaths moved me in the book and 1 of them was unnecessary (unless you cared about a tidy way to wrap up a love triangle). In fact, I think that is why I just didn't buy how this was wrapped up. The first two books were about fighting (to survive, to live, to spend with family/friends, to keep family/friends alive) and this book was about ________? Seriously most of it seemed to be about revenge and settling. Most of all I think Suzanne took the strong Katniss that I loved in the first two books and turned her to person I just didn't like. So when I began to dislike her, it just made the whole point of reading the book kind of moot. I think that is where I stopped the first time I tried to read it. I did eventually pick it up and read the last part but I had never done it at one time till the last few days. Even the 2nd time (which was better than the first) wasn't enough to change my feelings about the book.<br /><br />I thought the writing was as strong in this book as the others and the imagery was outstanding. I didn't see a few of the curveballs thrown coming my way and in the end I am glad I finished it. The things that bothered me others will love!<br /><br />Final Thought : I think overall this series did what it was supposed to do: make the reader think and feelmy way and in the end I am glad I finished it.

B001229HEK|5.0|I like/dislike aspects of every Mastodon album, but this is my overall favorite.  In between the in-you-face assault of Leviathan and the more cerebral Crack the Skye, you have an album where the band took their ambitions to new heights.<br /><br />Some complain it can be over-indulgent at times; but if a band has chops -- and Mastodon has plenty -- why not flex those muscles sometimes.  This album has some of the greatest jams in the Mastodon catalog.  The album is also experimental, even whimsical at times, and I appreciate any band that isn't afraid to take their music to unexpected places.  They are known as prog-metal after all, so some esoteric time shifts and tempo changes are to be expected.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, the album is just good, powerful rock.  If you don't believe me, go to YouTube and listen to the songs.  If you like Mastodon or have heard good things about them, you'll soon appreciate this album.
1400069289|5.0|Well written, a blast to read, and VERY full of useful information.  Heard him interviewed on Coast-2-Coast and the book lived up to the introduction and then some!
0307951529|5.0|You can tell that Chris Guillebeau is just as passionate about helping others start their own business and obtain independence as he is about travelling (next year he completes his goal of visiting all 193 countries). I've read his previous book, The Art of Nonconformity, and was inspired by his passion for designing a life based around things you loved to do. This one takes that attitude and helps guide you into making that life a reality. The advice is straightforward, practical, and to the point. One of the things I like about the author's style is how sparse it is. He packs more information into 300 something pages than other author's in this genre could into a 1,000. This book is a must read, and a must give (I've all ready passed my copy on to a friend and entrepreneur).

You can replay every game for more points and every game is so different it never gets repetitious!! Would recommend it to anyone. Plus its free. Would have paid for it!
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau, once again, blew me away with his motivational encouragement to live your dreams! (As he also did in [[ASIN:0399536108 The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World]].) The advice he provides and shares from other successful entrepreneurs in The $100 Startup is so helpful.  It is real advice that can help take a dream from a goal to reality.<br /><br />My husband and I have been small business owners for the past three years and we both read the book with excitement.  Our book is full of underlines and circles with ideas of how we can make our business even more successful.  His words reminded us that there is still so much to learn and so many ways to improve upon what we are doing already!<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book was hearing the stories of so many other entrepreneurs who are making their dreams a reality everyday.  Hearing their stories reminded me that we are actually not \\"crazy\\" and there are a lot of other people out there who have made the choice to live the life they want to live and are happy (and profitable too) doing just that!<br /><br />The step by step practical advice that Chris has shared in The $100 Startup is an awesome read for anyone who has an interest in making his/her dream of owning a business a reality... or, in fact, anyone who is already doing just that but would like to \\"create a new future\\" for the business he/she has already created!  Enjoy!!
0142000655|5.0|I have read this book over and over and over.  It is one of my absolute favorite books, and it has all that is great about Steinbeck:  the complex characters, interesting plots, joy, sorrow, pain, struggle...  It really has it all and is one of the greatest novels of early 20th century America ever published.  This should be a must-have in anyone's book collection.

0439023513|4.0|Well, the trilogy is now behind me.  This last book was my least favorite.  Although still a thrill ride, Katniss wallowed around too much for my taste and was not the strong young woman she was in the first two books.  I don't think I was expecting too much.  After complaining for so long about not having any real power and being controlled and told everything she was to do, Katniss seemed to take too willingly to being led around by the nose by the rebels in District 13 and manipulated by pretty much everyone.  There were only sparse moments when she showed any initiative and actually led anything.  Additionally, there were many things in the second half and particularly at the end that defied logic.  Yes, I know it was futuristic fantasy, but I'm talking about the motivations of the characters themselves that defied logic.  This was unsettling.  I think Haymitch, Plutarch and others needed to express why they were so pleased with Katniss's last rebelious act which resulted in her arrest.  Her trial was conducted without the reader's involvement which I thought was unforgivable.  We are just suddenly told she is free to go home.  I know why she did what she did, but the motivations of her friends, lovers and mentors are left as complete mysteries...like they had no involvement or care one way or another.  Also, I'm sure you can guess which love interest Katniss chooses, but the other just goes away without even a goodbye scene.  This was not believable.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I'm a big final fantasy game fan and FFVII was one of my favorite games.  I am a bit skeptic with games being turned into a movie but this one blew my mind away. The graphic, sound, and storyline are superb!  I highly recommend.

0345803485|2.0|In a way, this reminds me of reality TV - I can't pick out on single element of the book that I enjoy or admire, but I find that I have to finish (pun? HA!). Another reviewer said that the main character essentially IS Bella Swan, and I'd have to agree. The whole storyline reeks of implausibility - the characters are not realistic, the attraction between said characters is not realistic, the emotion is not realistic... It really is Twilight for adults. I'd like to outline the things that annoy me in case I can spare another reader:<br /><br />*The \\"heroine\\" is immature, clumsy, and weak<br />*The dialogue is awful and is extremely contrived (Mrs. Steele, Mr. Grey... flirting awkwardly in a book is just as annoying as seeing it in person...)<br />*Inner goddess, \\"Holy cow!\\"\\"Holy crap!\\", he touched my sex, he cocked his head to the side, biting my lower lip, sharp intake of air/breathed in sharply, gasped sharply, Oh my!.... I hate her writing.<br />*My GOD! These characters whine so much! Almost as bad as Edward and Bella! OMG he is going to leave me , does he care about me? OMG he bought me a car, I'm a whore...<br />*And the most annoying thing is.... For some crap reason that I can't identify, I'd like to finish the series. Same thing with Twilight. Like I said, I can't name a single thing that I like about these books or enjoy, but I'd like to read them all. I suppose this is how things \\"go viral\\". I guess I'm a sucker.<br /><br />I am annoyed with myself.

It's worth to put into experiment, not only for a spouse but also for everyone else.  I like the insight of it.  Indeed, if we all \\"speak\\" the love language belongs to a spouse, a friend, or a co-worker the result will be harmony, sweet and happy.[[ASIN:0802473156 The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts]]
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm officially hooked on the Game of Thrones series. The HBO show is pretty good, but the books offer so much more detail and room for individual interpretation. If you are looking for some reading that will draw you into the story, look no further.
0345803485|1.0|The reviews about this book are more erotic than the book itself.  If I could give a \\"no\\" star rating for this, I would.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Product installed easily. Once installed, I was able to pick up full strength signals from a long distance. In-fact, before I had this product, I could only see my next door neighbors networks. Now, when I turn this on, I see almost everyone on my streets network. I needed this product for work because the router is to far away from my office, and now I got full strength, and fast connection. Great product!!!!!
0545265355|4.0|Most trilogies are exactly what you expect but not so with Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games.  This trilogy is so seemless it's as if these are all one book merely sperated by different parts. Because of that the pacing is exacty what you would expect if you were reading one book.  Full of suspense and complex characters this set is a fantastic fun and fast paced read!<br />Respectfully - CB Anderson
B007PS0X0W|5.0|I love the Underworld movies...and this one is no different.  Awesome movie.  I like how they left it open for another one.  I enjoyed the twist of it.
0439023491|4.0|Takes a long time to get into the meat of the story. Liked the second arena much more than the first, much more imaginative. Overall a good book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has become my favorite singer. I love her soulful songs which reach out and grab your heart. Every song on this ablum is a winner for me. I can't get enough of Adele and her music.
0439023513|3.0|Title says it all. Parts of it are disjointed and downright confusing and I felt certain events were just downright necessary but overall I felt that it ended on a satisfactory note and is probably the most emotionally complex book in the series.
0545123275|2.0|You might want to skip this one or check it out from the library. I admit the first couple chapters in this book really got me hooked into the story. However in my opinion after a few brilliantly written chapters the plot soon falls into a similar plot line as *gasp* Twilight. Sam saves Grace's life. Grace falls in love with the mysterious boy Sam. She can't be with Sam for long because he's a werewolf and she's not. Grace feels desperately alone without Sam and will do anything to be with him. etc. Sadly this book was a disappointment the plot and characters seemed too shallow. I had to force myself to finish it. I'm not bashing this author because her style of prose is beautifully written but somehow the plot was just lacking. For that reason I'm giving it two stars.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i love it thanks! it works<br />and its easy! great! nice wotk with the photo editor i suggest all should use this very amazing...k im done lol

B000X1T7MS|5.0|Mr. Spencer's book approaches a very controversial topic with intelligence and scholarship, and I would recommend it and any of the P.I.G. series for their respective topics. For Kindle users, it might be helpful to know that while the table of contents has links to the text, the footnotes do not have links to the footnotes page in the back. Also, the front cover is not visible on the Kindle edition.
B000NA2776|5.0|Upbeat, snappy album that showcases Mika's range.  A great pick-me-up album with some really catchy songs!<br />It's very reminiscent of Freddie Mercury in many places.
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau does a fantastic job of making an important distinction between passion and a business. Businesses solve problems and passion gets you through the roller coaster ride of getting things off the ground.<br /><br />I like that Guillebeau not only highlighted the multi-million dollar ideas that came out of a shoestring budge, but also covered unique businesses making a very realistic $50,000 a year that despite the hard work, could offer you the freedom, control, and income potential of running your own business.<br /><br />Okay so $100 might be a little low, and the preference is for information marketing, but one of the largest areas of growth and opportunity to share your expertise is through information/service businesses. The internet is still growing in ubiquity, meanwhile the security of a 9-5 corporate job is a mirage at best. Walk down any street and look at how many people are buried in to their phones, their kindles, their nooks, and their Ipads.<br /><br />Chris Guillebeau is a leader in helping those with diverse ideas find traction in a workable and scalable business model. He's incredibly genuine and reading his work makes it feel as though you are sitting across from him at a coffee shop. I've been following his blog for years, and routinely recommend [[ASIN:0399536108 The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World]] to those close to me looking to take ownership over their lives.<br /><br />One of the best areas of the book is when he outlines specific questions and criteria to consider at different stages of a product launch sequence. A great product will offer value and solve a problem, but a great business knows how to excite its consumers and make the process of buying their product simple and enjoyable.<br /><br />Guillebeau is realistic in that he understands that sometimes the hardest part is earning that first $1.63, but I like how he emphasizes action over ideas and isn't out there promising million dollar returns. His take is that $50,000 with your own business is in fact VERY achievable if you simply recognize the possibility in the first place. When you earn more, well that's just extra icing on the cake.
B0067QPVJ6|1.0|I do have to give this film credit, you don't know who the killer is until the end.  Spoiler Alert:  The killer is the movie itself.  You see it kills two hours from your life that you will never get back.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I got this book through a recommendation through a blogger friend, and she said it's a must-read edutaining MUST-read for anyone who's aspiring to become a best-selling self-published author.<br /><br />This author has achieved great success by self-publishing his stories, and the tactics he reveals in this book are both insightful and actionable.<br /><br />Here are the points that I ESPECIALLY like about this read:<br /><br />it's written by guy who's DONE it . Too much success advice comes from people who never experienced the success themselves.  Not so John Locke - he has incredible<br />sales numbers and hardcore fans - just check out his website donovancreed.com check out his reader comments !<br /><br />- it's straight to the point.  I hate authors who fill up books with endless fluff to make you think you get more bang for your back.<br />John Locke focuses on the essential and makes it entertaining. I luv it.<br /><br />- it's super-helpful. I have almost no experience with publishing, and this book explains everything from planning your book \\"brand\\" to building a loyal and raving reader fan base.<br /><br />Warning ! It's very commercial - don't expect this book to be a love letter about writing and being an author - John Locke focuses EXCLUSIVELY on the business aspect and selling lots of copies.<br /><br />It's a fast & valuable read. And because it's both informative and entertaining, you will read it again. And again. And again.<br />Buy this book if you want to be a successful self-published author on Amazon.

We even have had dad involved when neither one of us can guess. If one of us feels we cant figure out how to draw the picture we have the other help. It has turned into a family fun game that is both clean and fun. No matter how old or young you are, we have found an app that is fun. I highly recommend!!
B0064MT1NU|2.0|I adore this movie and picked up this Blu-Ray the week it came out.  It is a huge disappointment, though, seeing as somebody really screwed up and left off the subtitles.  So in the scenes where Ada signs, or when the Maori people speak, there is no way to tell what they are saying unless, like me, you pretty much have the dialogue memorized.  Even so, I returned this Blu-Ray and am holding on to my DVD version.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Have to pay three times for one book in order to read entire book charged three times for repetitious and essentially knight in shining army fantasy for women. Before there ever was a woman's movement horrible example
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is non stop fun. 80's pop culture is everywhere in the book, but you don't need to know all the references to enjoy the ride. My only complaint is that it ended. Its a quick read that you won't want to put down until its done. Cline pulls in the reader from the outset with his great description and attention to detail.
1455508977|2.0|I enjoyed Sparks' previous novels, like A Walk to Remember and The Notebook. However, the Lucky One fell short for me. I kept reading, hoping something exciting would happen. A very predictable book. I found myself skimming pages.
B007GNMJYE|4.0|As someone who has rather \\"alternative\\" taste in female musicians (Bj&ouml;rk, Kate Bush, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Regina Spektor, etc), when I first heard \\"The Family Jewels\\" back in 2010 I was totally obsessed. The quirky welsh girl who wrote and composed her own songs on her cheap keyboard that she bought from Argos totally captured my imagination and became one of my favourite artists. Her music was the perfect combination of \\"indie\\" and pop - and it was a relief to actually have an album of fun pop music that actually had some credibility. It was some of the most beautiful pop music I had ever heard.<br /><br />In 2011 she surprised us all by releasing the very commercially influenced \\"Radioactive\\", and I became rather worried about this next album. When \\"Primadonna\\" came out I was relieved. Yes, it was sugary bubblegum pop, but Marina's voice sounded amazing and her pretty quirkiness was back and actually sounded really cool surrounded by the commercial but well produced beats courtesy of Dr Luke. I resisted the urge to write a review straight away, as many other reviewers have, as I wanted to live with the album for a while and know how I felt about it.<br /><br />The album starts with \\"Bubblegum Bitch\\", which sounds like a song from the opening credits from a 90's American teen chick film (\\"Clueless\\" springs to mind for me). \\"Lies\\" and \\"Starring Role\\" are both very currently commercial in their sound, but Marina's lyrics and genuine sounding vocal delivery rescue them from being total sell-outs.<br /><br />\\"The State Of Dreaming\\" starts out sounding like its title - dreamy, ethereal and beautiful, and suddenly explodes into a very poppy, sweet but catchy chorus. \\"Power and Control\\" and \\"Living Dead\\" use powerful 80's sounding beats and epic choruses and work very well.<br /><br />A few reviewers have said the second half of the album gets a bit dull, but I think it's where the album really turns into a better, more satisfying direction. \\"Teen Idle\\" is atmospheric, dark, and beautifully layered. Those who loved \\"I Am Not A Robot\\" and \\"Numb\\" from the previous album will be relieved to know that Marina hasn't lost her touch for writing beautiful melancholic pop songs. The lyrics (about a suicidal teenager who wishes she were popular) and production make it quite a dark song, so it's interesting to hear cheerleader chants being used in such an interesting, creative, and actually quite beautiful way - almost as if their presence depresses the \\"character\\" singing the song and actually cheer on the fact that she is suicidal.<br /><br />The final four tracks on the special edition are really good. \\"Radioactive\\" sounds really good in context with the rest of the album. \\"Buy the Stars\\" is classic Marina - it sounds like \\"Obsessions\\" but is actually far more beautiful; silly not be included in the album, but perhaps too similar in style to \\"The Family Jewels\\" to be officially included.<br /><br />What makes this album stand out is Marina's unique vocals, lyrics and melodies, and even the production has a unique edge to it - chirping birds, deep bass lines, and strange electronic effects. It's an interesting mix of sweet and sugary combined with dark melancholia, conjuring up images of Barbie (or some other high profile names in the pop world) on a hangover from alcohol and illegal substances and re-evaluating whether the \\"glamorous\\" and pretentious life and relationships she's created for herself are actually making her happy.<br /><br />There's a lot being said about this album being Marina \\"selling-out\\" - do I think it's true? No! The lyrics and vocals sound genuine and are beautifully performed. The songs themselves are wonderfully written - Marina is a wonderfully gifted and clever song writer. This may be a pop album, but it's full of well written songs and lyrical substance to back it up. It may not be the experimental masterpiece that \\"The Family Jewels\\" was, but it's a wonderfully melancholic pop album from a wonderful, genuine, and honest artist nonetheless.ful, genuine, and honest artist nonetheless.
0307951529|5.0|When I launched my microbusiness, I had no idea who Chris Guillebeau was. I cobbled together information from this website or that blog and figured out how to start up a digital entrpreneurship. Had this amazing resource existed back then? I would have saved countless hours of research, because everything you need to launch is, literally, right at your fingertips.<br /><br />Having participated in Guillebeau's first World Domination Summit, I knew before I picked up The $100 Startup that he's one bright, inspirational (and extremely down to earth) guy. The guidance and stories shared in the book just furthered my belief that Guillebeau is the best of the best for microbusiness owners, and those who aspire to go it alone.<br /><br />The $100 Startup is engaging, actionable and incredibly easy to read, yet not overly simple. Great, great resource for anyone ready to carve out an entrepreneurial path, today.

B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I enjoyed all the underworld movies,and this one kept to the nature of underwould one and two.always love a movie that has the same actors and continue s where the last movie ended.one of very few that does thst and is a real treat.one thing I thought was strange was Michael.in the beginning you see him at the docks but funny thing is,its not realky him,but a cgi face on another actor.most people wouldnt pick that up,but I tend to see things others dont see haha.but the cgi is actully pretty good and you will prob wont notice.you also see him frozen at the end of the movie and there you can deff.tell its not him.but how the movie ended,it looks likevanother movie is on its way,and hopefully Michaels character will be in the full film.now with the 3d.dont get me wrong,i love 3d films and I have a nice setup but bad news people.it was filmd in 2:40 ratio,which means when you play it,it will have the treaded black bars on the top and bottom.some dont mind it but I truly hate it,bc i focus more on the black bars then the actully movie haha,and plus this is a dark movie and 3d and darkness aint the best combo.
B0012YSZGE|4.0|This review is for the German Steelbook version of T2: Director's Cut only, on HD DVD format.<br /><br />Just wanna start off by saying i am a big fan of HD DVDs, mostly because they're no longer produced and sort of collectible, also because they have quite a lot of integrity, high quality menus, lossless sound (in this case the German company \\"Kinowelt\\" went all the way and added 7.1 channel DTS surround sound), all the extras and special features of the US blu ray counterpart (some in German only) except the theatrical and special code editions of the movie, and... Oh yeah,  the movie is mastered in Full 1080p High Def! If ur a fan of rare items with integrity, then definately get this steel case high resolution disc, and don't worry the movie was produced in both German 7.1 and Englisch 7.1, also a 2.0 Englisch surround sound headphone option for those of us who only have a stereo or quadrophonic sound system, (like me).<br /><br />I've never seen T2 look better, even though the film was originally shot on Super 35mm grain film stock. This master is about 80% HD transfer, yet does still carry some of the grainy look in several scenes. I would definately buy this great item again, just wish \\"Kinowelt\\" would have included the theatric and special CODE edition of T2, and that the SKYNET link from 2008 was still supported by some kind of back up website... Overall the director's cut on this disc is well worth the $$$, especially this HI-RES transfer, surround sound, 50+ special features, and steelbook case. The movie and all features were burned on only 1 disc for whatever reason.<br /><br />I had a ball experiencing T2: Ultimate HD edition... :)<br />-b<br /><br />(Note: This product does require an HD-DVD ROM optical drive -w- Arcsoft Total Media Theatre 3 or 5, or an HD DVD player/Xbox 360 HD DVD drive to uncode and play the movie.)
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|I missed this while it was in theaters,so I was looking forward to seein it once it got to blu ray.boy I wish I skipped it.very boring and the story is all over the place.if you need to watch it,atleast wait for it to be 1.99 to rent it

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Don't buy this book unless you like staying up late reading.  Grabbing your kindle at stop lights to read one more page, and aching when the book is over.  Mr Howey has written a classic post apocalyptic/sci-fi masterpiece.  Great characters, compelling plot, stirring action.  Seriously stop reading this and get it.

0307951529|5.0|You know how when you pick up your typically business book and it goes deep into one specific area, say SEO or marketing? Or, it's high-level and inspirational? Both of those types of books are great if you are either established in your business or thinking about just getting started - but tend to fail the person who is actually TRYING to get started.<br /><br />Enter the $100 startup. This is the book you want if you are trying to get started. It will inspire you AND tell you what you need to do. It bridges the gap between \\"I might have an idea\\" and \\"I've been doing this for a while.\\"<br /><br />The case studies are great, and really inspiring, but what I think is super-valuable to the new entrepreneur is how Chris provides checklists the whole way through for everything to how to (successfully) launch a new product, finding your target market, how to publish a book, how to create a membership site, business audits, partnership agreements, pricing, creating offers and sales pages, marketing plans. And, the ever-so-important reality checks.<br /><br />And, because it's Chris, it's biased towards doing what you LOVE and leading a \\"life of adventure, meaning, and purpose.\\" Which I think should be everyone's goals.
B007DJUO8O|4.0|So, you want to read a review because you have no idea what this album sounds like, right? It's not easy to give you any help...<br /><br />Lesson 1: This is NOT Opeth, and this is NOT Porcupine Tree.<br /><br />It's an album mostly devoid of percussion and metal guitars. It is more on the easy and lightweight side, but with a dark secret. The melodies in themselves are simple, the instruments and vocals soft and airy (Drag Ropes a bit of an exception). But of course nothing is ever as simple as that with these mucisians. There are unexpected sounds and twists betwixt these beautiful melodies. Parts that make you go: what the ...?<br /><br />The first track, Drag Ropes (9.50), had an official release on youtube, so my suggestion is that you go there and try it out. It's an eerie and beautiful, orchestral and epic piece with a great animated video. Now when I listen to the song, I always see those images in my head.<br /><br />The best way I can describe the second track, Storm Corrosion (10.10), is to suggest you think of Simon & Garfunkel. This is true for the first 5-6 minutes at least. What happens then is a rising... sound... that is creepy and powerful, but that I can't really call \\"music\\" in its strictest sense. It's a difficult transition for the listener to make, but as the album progresses you understand more about the idea behind this contrast. The song finishes with a return to the original melody.<br /><br />The third track, Hag (6.30), is perhaps my favourite. It rises slowly from a dark silence with soft guitar tones and piano key-strikes, accompanied by Wilson's one-word song lines. It picks up a high-pitched electric organ sound and some more guitar melodies. 4,5 minutes in there's a 45 second long guitar and drum combo that feels straight out of Opeth's Heritage album, and that is the most metal you'll hear on this record. Then the track goes back to finishing off in the same style as it opened.<br /><br />Track four, Happy (4.50), again makes me think a lot of Simon & Garfunkel. But the eerie contrasts are back. And the track structure is a bit backwards. It starts with what feels like the ending, and then in the middle comes what feels like a natural start to a song. Otherwise, a soft acoustic guitar is plucking along at its strings, sometimes accompanied by an electric guitar. Interwoven with this melody are what I can best describe as distorted electric machine sounds from an evil dimension!<br /><br />Lock Howl, track number five (6.10), is a relatively fast-paced instrumental diddle. I guess it makes sense to make change the beat before the closing track, which is perhaps the softest on the record. I guess this piece feels somewhat that it could belong on Heritage as well, but not entirely. The acoustic guitar melody runs along with an electric guitar tempo in the background. About halfway in, the song pauses and picks up a new beat with clapping sounds and a queer psychadelic organ sound, then almost gets quiet with some soft wind instrument. Then it starts up from the beginning again with some additional sounds.<br /><br />Ljudet Innan (10.20), a Swedish title that translates to \\"The Sound Before\\", closes the album. It starts with Mikael singing softly and low, a lament from the deep. After, an electric organ rises very slowly and gets an echoing guitar string occassionally joining in. Halfway in, an electric lead guitar adds a light melody and Wilson comes in with some of his soft vocals. Not much more happens.<br /><br />The album journey from start to finish is soft and strange at the same time. Here are some of the more beautiful melodies you will have heard, arranged with some of the more difficult sounds to listen to. But these contrasts are not so much \\"in your face\\", and they don't happen often, to my delight. I wouldn't want too much weirdness messing up the beauty that is in here.<br />At first listen it will be hard to understand, but this album grows steadily stronger with every listen. Ofcourse, it's nothing you would turn on when it's time to party, or if you want to feel the energy pulsing in your veins. But perhaps towards the end of the night when everyone's quieting down on the couch in the dark, or when you're alone on a grey day...<br />It's a great album, but of course there's room for improvement.<br />4/5
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is very enjoyable, very challenging and fun.  I think I like this game more than I like angry birds.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The quality of the graphics is fantastic and the gameplay is pretty cool, but the UI is HORRIBLE.  Didn't they bother testing this internally?  Once you start the game, you're stuck.  There's no simple way out, except to shut off the kindle. And killing the game that way loses your progress.<br /><br />The game developers & producers really blew it with this one.  From the initial game design where the controls were specified, through the final QA process, someone should have noticed that there's no easy way to bail out of this game.  Shame on them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun game. there are many games in this app which make it very fun, and entertaining
B007SYWFRM|4.0|An explicit EXIT button should exist. I do not even see a MENU button. These important features should be obvious.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I bought this processor for a gaming only rig.  I have it paired with an ASRock Z77 Pro4-M, 8GB DDR3-1333 RAM and a Radeon HD 7770.  The machine works flawlessly.  Every game I've tried I'm running at the highest graphics settings with no issues.<br /><br />For the majority (I'd say 95% just to throw out a number) of apps and games the i5 provides more than enough power.  The reality is most applications are not designed/optimized to use 6-8 cores/threads so you gain no real performance advantages.  That is why the i7 only score very marginally higher than the i5 in game benchmarks; few things can/do make use of the i7s extra power.<br /><br />Most gamers feel like 30FPS is \\"playable\\" and 60+ is optimal and the i5 might do 1-3 FPS less than the i7.<br /><br />Bottom line ... if you want the best gaming CPU (and its overkill for most everything else except high-end video editing/graphics work) ... get this one.
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau has inspired me over and over and this book is no exception. Setting his own rules and taking risks despite odds has lead him down a path that few discover.

Stop waiting for good things to fall in your lap, go find them & create a life that most dream of. Chris has showed me this and now I am writing my own future.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|I've been waiting for this album since I learned all the words of the previous one by heart. The release date of the album could not have come soon enough. I am not in the least bit disappointed by Little Broken Hearts. The songwriting brings out Jones' feelings wonderfully and the music production is a nice departure from the previous albums. Of course, Jones' beautiful voice was excellent as always. I enjoyed every song on this album. Some more than others obviously, but I'll listen to every one of them over and over.

B004DSX5B6|5.0|Having used Gerber multi-tools for many years I feel this product moves their line forward in a very positive way. The first thing you notice is that all tools except the pliers can be used without having to open the handles. (Pliers of course need the handles open) In my older versions you would have to open the handles lift the tool needed then close the handle before use. This doesn't sound like much except that when you need to switch back and forth between tools it became a real pain. Now all tools are quick and easy to use. In fact two of the most used blades have a thumb tab that allows them to be opened with a flick using only one hand. The second thing that you notice is that all blades, tools, lock when open. This is fantastic as in the older versions blades could slip and try to close on your fingers. (handles prevented full closure but it was still dangerous as well as annoying) The locks are released by pulling down sliders on both sides of the handles. These were very stiff at first but loosened up quickly on use. The best way to release blades is to grip the releases on both sides at once using finger & thumb and pulling straight down.<br /><br /> PROS: Compact, Well made, Good weight, Tools open without opening handles, Tools lock when open, Thumb speed tabs for two blades, Rubber grip surface inset in handles.<br /><br /> CONS: Doesn't really go with dress clothes meaning I can't carry it at work,(LOL)however all kidding aside it does ride in my briefcase for those office odd jobs.<br /><br />Fantastic addition to the Gerber line. Very happy with this purchase.
0062082353|4.0|As a former active duty Marine, current peace officer/swat sniper, I felt compelled to offer a bit of insight, after reading a few of the reviews for American Sniper.<br />There were more than a few grumblings that the book was poorly written. Okay, Kyle is an elite operator who works in hostile climates, not an editor for the wall street journal, so sure, a little leniency should be afforded in that arena.<br />Second, many complained the specific details of method, field craft, specific elements of kill we're excluded. Refer to explanation one. The author is offering an inside look into the brutal world of combat, not furnishing a play book for your next paintball war.<br />Finally, the fact Kyle has revealed himself at all should be enough. Depriving another human being of his/her life guarantees two things; 1) exclusive membership to a club no one wants to be a part of, and 2) a head full of memories you cannot fight or drink away.<br />The book is what it is. The story of a hard man doing a hard job, better to simply be thankful guys like him exist than ponder why his vernacular is not filled with wonderment and emotion while describing the horror that is war.

0307951529|4.0|I wish that I had this book ten years ago when I started my first business! But as I consider launching myself once again into the solopreneur world, this book has quickly become a go-to guide on what to do right, even if it is the 2nd time around.<br /><br />Sure, not everyone can start a product-based business with just $100 (as an earlier reviewer mentions regarding the example of the mattress store Chris uses in the book), but I think the point is that some people have and for perhaps for you, depending on what your particular service or product widget is, $100 just might do it.  And therein lies the beauty in the book.  Chris helps you explore whether or not your particular idea can succeed (with nifty action oriented blueprints, plenty of case stories and lots of real life examples from his own business to help along the way) and then how to get it launched into success.<br /><br />For me, one of the best things about this book is the \\"don't procrastinate\\" message that is in every page.  Do you have a really good idea?  Okay, then explore how to make it a reality using this book as your how-to toolkit but whatever you do, don't just sit on your butt, waiting for....something, anything.  Once you figure out, through this book, that yes, your idea is viable then Chris outlines the exact strategy on how to get that incredible idea to market, quickly, smartly and in a way that will make you some serious money.<br /><br />A terrific, smart, fun, easy read.  Not to be missed if you are considering starting your own gig.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I have an advance copy and have about 25 pages left to go hence the 4 star rating.  But I anticipate going back to make it 5 stars when I finish.

1853280879|4.0|Used book in good condition. But the book is the first edition, though the description  says that it is the second edition.<br /><br />I am from India. So I had to pay a lot of money for the book because of the high shipping charges.<br /><br />Though it is the first edition, the book is one of the first on the subject. That way, it has its own value.<br /><br />I would have preferred the latest edition, even if it was a used book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i think it is going to be a awesome.  when i make my own villige  im go to make so much coins it will explode the product
0307951529|5.0|I'm very choosy about the books I recommend and The $100 Startup is a must-read for anyone thinking about starting a business. Chris wrote a useful, concrete book that you can use to get your business up and running, with relatable, real-world examples. I love his profit approach to passion--make sure you sell what people buy--and I love that he provides specific strategies for doing just that.<br /><br />Another favorite: The reality checklist, an honest approach to the time and energy it's really going to take to build your business. We don't talk enough about that. We see a lot of \\"business porn\\" out there; the overnight success, but not enough on the blood, sweat + tears that go into building a business. It's just not considered sexy. (For the record, I think it is! I'd love to see more people being honest about it.)<br /><br />There's much inspiration + practical advice to be had in The $100 Startup. Chris knows what he's doing; he walks the walk, and what he's written here is specific, consistent and generous.  I predict it will become an instant favorite.

055357342X|5.0|I don't have much new to say that hasn't been shouted many times before in these reviews. I agree with nearly every bit of praise. His love for the characters is more clear here than ever before. Besides Sansa, I can't think of a single \\"main\\" character that I can't wait to read about. And Jaime! (small spoiler) - Martin can turn a character I despised into one I cheered for... truly a master storyteller and the finest fantasy writer of our age.

0811879542|5.0|Before I even had a chance to read this book, I saw my 8yo with it, reading, shaking the book, and laughing outloud. I wondered what could be holding his attention since he's been reading novels for a while now, so I grabbed my 5yo and 3yo and ready it to them at the first chance. They were both enamored with it. A simple concept but executed in such a fun and imaginative way. We usually give books as birthday gifts for other children, and I'm pretty sure that this will be out go-to gift this year.<br /><br />If you liked this book, I'd also recommend Zero and One by Kathryn Otoshi. They have a similar art style with wonderful moral messages. They're favorites at our house. [[ASIN:097239463X Zero]][[ASIN:0972394648 One]]
0312641893|3.0|Initially, I wasn't going to read this book, maybe because I was a bit wary of a cyborg-Cinderella story. I mean, a cynic like me who hears rumors of a dystopian novel set with robots, technology, kingdoms, and BEIJING would immediately have expected something subpar. But I looked at that cover, and I thought that I should get it just to stare at it. I still can't stop staring at it. The reflections on the shoe and the metal bones. AHHH. That is some serious case of cover-love.<br /><br />For this review, I'll start with the characters.<br />Cinder: Cool. Awkward. Another one of those ugly-but-pretty girls. Prone to strange acts of embarrassment, like hiding herself behind her hair while she gasps? I don't know. Meyer's description needs some improvement.<br /><br />Kai: Cutie. Immature, but of course he's never been taught in etiquette because he's a prince! No, he just suffers from some foot-in-mouth syndrome sometimes. Other than that, he improves towards the end, and his reaction to the situation is about the only one that made sense. Although he needs to stop inclining his head and making his hair fall into his eyes. He's going to go blind soon if he doesn't get a haircut.<br /><br />Peony: Meyer is just too cruel. Peony is the sweetest character ever. And I feel like she had more potential than what she was given. To be honest, it felt more like she was more engineered to die than anything else.<br /><br />Pearl and Adri: Bitches. Both of 'em. I was hoping for something that would make them understandable, and Meyer seemed to have been going in that direction in the beginning of the book, with all the stuff with Adri seeming guilty about sending Cinder away. But nope. They're just bitches. Which was quite a disappointment. Like Meyer sort of wanted to change things up but got lazy or forgot.<br /><br />Dr. Erland: I quite like this guy. He's funny. Strangely enough, I thought he was the evil one, and his ending was one of the few things I didn't immediately realize in the beginning.<br /><br />Queen Levana: Diabolical. However, I think Meyer spent a little too much time talking about Levana being evil instead of showing that she was. Because of this, her actions seemed more wooden, and I could only manage a \\"huh\\" at the end.<br /><br />Not a very exciting cast of characters (with the exception of the Doctor. He was awesome.) or even witty dialogue, in my opinion, but something that redeemed this was the idea. CINDER is possibly one of the more original books I've read, which is ironic considering the fairytale it revolves around. It had so much potential, but Meyer only pulls off half of it. I loved the idea of the Lunars, since moving to space is a big deal in the world of science. That an author would consider exploring the ramifications shows a capacity for creativity that got me to keep flipping pages. The unfortunate thing is that Meyer starts off with a predictable plot, and an equally predictable set of characters. Despite the fresh idea, this book seems to be only a shell of what could have been amazing. The setting of New Beijing in the midst of all this stuff about \\"dystopian America\\" is actually nicely done. I can't complain too much about her world building--despite passing off a disease as something with no cure, no origins, no nothing, she does explain, albeit blatantly obviously.<br /><br />That was what knocked off a star for me. How blatantly obvious everything is, even from the beginning. I basically read 200 pages just to have everything confirmed for me. It would've been nice if Meyer had thrown in a plot twist or two to spice things up. The ending was intended to be cliffhanger-y, but I just said \\"meh,\\" then booted up my computer to write this review.<br /><br />The other star is for the mediocre cast. The three stars are for the brilliant idea and the cover, maybe even for some of the cute scenes between Kai and Cinder that made me laugh. I liked her entrance into the ball. Also, this book kept me reading, despite everything, and that's always important.eading, despite everything, and that's always important.
0307716546|5.0|Although I enjoyed Rosamund Lupton's first novel, \\"Sister\\", I was completely enthralled with \\"Afterwards: A Novel\\".<br /><br />Uniquely written, once I became accustomed to her style of writing the story flowed to the very end.<br /><br />Grace, the narrator, and her daughter Jenny are seriously injured in a fire that was believed to be purposefully set. Grace tells the story from the vantage point outside of her body. Jenny then joins her and both, not being ready to release their hold on life, intensely watch their family and friends struggle to cope with reality and try to piece together the events leading to the fire.<br /><br />\\"Afterwards: A Novel\\" is intriguing and heartbreaking. This story of unconditional love, this Mom has for her children, moved me like few others.

B00812W9QM|5.0|every once in a while u know u have seen something special on tv or in a movie. a point at which an already beloved show has an artistic moment of truth and beauty and/or sometimes reality that is so welldone that it takes ur breath away.<br /><br />don draper sat down tonight, and had every opportunity to get the joke. the sound was perfect, the environment absolutely perfect. he got a good listen. as a viewer we got a good listen too- to a song that nobody ever expected to see used as a representation of a moment in time. Its moments like these that make me thankful that this group never allowed their songs to be used in such a way. in fact i am now rethinking my whole position on copyright law.<br /><br />he got a proper listen and reminded us all that MANY people back then didn't get the joke. not because they didnt give it a listen or didn't understand. much like today, people are choosing a similarly doomed path. they had a proper look and STILL decided to screw us all up in republican/puritanical/conservative/hypocritical hell for another damn generation.<br /><br />nutshelled: this show has reached a new high and if u wondered if the show would ever properly embrace when things got crazy and show it as it happened, this episode proved it can and it will.<br /><br />wow.

The better the excuse, the more content people can feel about not doing that thing that you'd really like to do.<br /><br />What Chris Guillebeau has done is to take away the very best excuse of all: \\"I don't have the money.\\"<br /><br />(Cousins of this excuse: \\"I'm too poor to start a business, I need to MAKE money, I can't consider quitting my job because I need more money, etc.)<br /><br />This book is nothing if not SPECIFIC. There are 50 actual, real, on-the-ground case studies of people who did what the book claims is do-able... who built a business based on what they already knew for very little money. And this isn't just internet startups. This is tangible stuff... the kind of businesses everyone understands.<br /><br />CG has proven that it can be done, over and over and over again. So DO IT. Read this book... and DO IT NOW.

The story of scientific research<br /><br />Because the story of the family is so engaging, the book is able to cover some important issues by personalizing what could seem like dry topics.
0143119680|3.0|I found this book at first almost dull but the use of history and science really interesting, especially the novel explaination of witches DNA. Obviously a good deal of research has gone into this book. The settings are beautifully described and there is a lot of detailed writing but I found the first quarter of the book slow and plodding.<br />Starting off slowly, at times it seemed to be teetering on the brink of classic Mills & Boon but managed to pull back just in time to a more reasoned and intelligent storyline. There were so many descriptions of Matthews deep need to protect Diana and it was repeated many times. I almost gave up and stopped reading, and then..<br />Then Harkenss seems to find her stride in the last half of the book. The characters seem to relax into their roles and become more three dimensional. The pace evens out, there is more interaction, more variety of emotions - even some humor.<br />The ending is enticing and will guarantee the majority of Discovery readers will plunge into the second in the series.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Even though I do not yet own Lungs by Florence + The Machine, I have checked it out of my local public library. It is great. Florence + The Machine have done a collection of five-star songs all throughout Lungs, which makes it a five-star album. My favorite song on there is \\"Cosmic Love;\\" it is very ethereal and mystical, not to mention it paints a picture of being out in space with both the lyrics and the music combined. I plan to get this album, as well as Florence + The Machine's second album, Ceremonials, and I recommend both of them to everyone who loves great music.

B004AYCWY4|4.0|Overall the book is a solid read. I enjoyed the examples for mutation and speciation and really wanted more. I felt that every mention of Creationist drivel was space wasted for actual information. However, Dawkins did not waste too much space with their nonsense but I'm at the point where I am realizing it is the same arguments from that group over and over (from other books, debates, and videos) and I'm simply fatigued.<br /><br />Of course the book left me wanting more but the topic is so broad, with so much evidence, that I can see how it is difficult/ impossible to cover each avenue of evidence in great detail without becoming a set of textbooks. An all around good job though with a very strong end of the last chapter to finish. I would like to see more on genetics from Dawkins as he uses his vocabulary superbly in making that topic very accessible.<br /><br />I do recommend this book be read with Donald Prothero's \\"Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters\\" as well as Jerry Coyne's \\"Why Evolution is True\\" as the each fill in some of the details left open here.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these books!  I was skeptical at first thinking all the attention the stories were getting were just to boost ticket sales for the movie.  I was surprised at how fast I was hooked in the story...I could hardly put it down.  You definitely want to go ahead and get the trilogy versus book by book.  That way, you can go straight into the next book without having to wait to get the next one.
B001EC3JME|4.0|The holster fits my 5.11 PC3.300 fairly well. It fits snugly and the flashlight doesn't seem to have much movement if any at all. The clip also fits perfectly over my duty belt making it easy to take one and off. I haven't had it long enough to comment on how well it holds up to the everyday use and wear and tear of law enforcement, but for the price I will be satisfied if it last 6 months anything after that will just be a bonus, I don't expect miracles from a $6 holster.
0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is exactly what I've needed. It isn't just a book--it's a whole course complete with checklists, specific steps and instructions, countless charts that can be easily reproduced, toolkits, strategies, and key points at the end of each chapter. Everything is so well organized.<br /><br />If it were only a course, though, it wouldn't hold my attention for long. What I love about it is that it's readable and fun to read--business books usually put me to sleep even if they have good info. But this is lively and engaging at every point, and it's thorough. When I first browsed through, I saw that I would be reading twice--first to just read and absorb, and then a second time to go through it step by step, take notes or use the tools, and act on specific sections.<br /><br />The case studies are partly what makes it so interesting and readable. They're people I can identify with or picture in my mind, and they've had all the struggles or challenges that anyone has.<br /><br />The parts that have been most useful to me (so far):<br /><br />Chapter 2: Give them the fish. This nails a trouble spot of mine--I'm a natural teacher (and taught  professionally at one time), and I tend to go way overboard explaining things and giving so much away that people just don't need. Many people appreciate that about me, but it's time I don't have to spend, and most people just don't need it.<br /><br />Chapter 5: The new demographics. Yep, the only thing that matters is who needs what I'm offering, and those people can come from anywhere, any group, any income, etc. My job is to know where they are or where to find them.<br /><br />Chapter 6: The one-page business plan and in Ch. 10 the one-page promotion plan. I'm grateful for the simplicity! There are so many details in business that anyone can get lost in them, but Chris just shaves away anything we don't need and serves it up straight. I guess you could say he gives us the fish.<br /><br />Almost every page has something I need. The launch checklist...too much to mention.<br /><br />Having read or browsed through countless other books and courses on business practices or models, I believe The $100 Startup is essential for anyone who wants to start or grow a small business. I've got to a certain point in my business, and I need to take it to the next level now by correcting any mistakes and forging ahead.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|The actual product was fine and Amazon's delivery time was excellent, but the movie itself has too many scenes that are in the dark.  Makes it unpleasant to watch.
B0081D9MG6|5.0|Obviously, this episode was polarizing, but I loved it. I thought it was *meant* to be fun and tongue-in-cheek. A nice fluffy episode before all hell breaks loose in next week's finale.<br /><br />From the name of the victim - Hanson Stevens - a mixture of the names of EPs Hart Hanson and Stephen Nathan, with Angela's sketch a combo of both - to movie replicas of the team to inside facts and jokes known to Bones fans...4:47, Huckleberry's donuts, it was a treat. Not just for spoofing the show and their jobs and the characters, but also a treat to get a glimpse of the very real Fox lot where \\"Bones\\" tapes. Including making fun of themselves and likely fan criticisms by stating \\"everybody hates Hanson\\", \\"Canadians don't gloat\\", and my personal favorite wink: \\"Hanson writes nothing but crap\\". I think Hart Hanson's voice may have had a cameo last night, too.<br /><br />Oh, another nice few touches were Fake Booth wearing a \\"Cooky\\" (versus \\"Cocky\\") belt buckle...and Real Hodgins warming to Fake Hodgins, especially once Fake Hodgins spilled Cam's secret (hysterical!) past. A nod to DB's \\"Angel\\", too, maybe? Hmmm! The end scene with the gang watching that movie was terrific. I almost wonder if that was their first time seeing it as the reactions seemed suspiciously genuine with the laughter! Nice close \\"family vibe\\" with them all there. Complete with donuts.<br /><br />Mr. Hanson even said this episode was a shout out to the devoted fans of the show, and with all of the in-jokes and winks, I think it did more than deliver the goods.<br /><br />Kudos for a fun episode. Bring on the finale!

0307716546|5.0|This book is one of the best that I've read in a long time. It's a literary work with a mystery wrapped inside, and I could not put it down.<br /><br />The book tells the story of the Covey family after a fire completely rearranges their lives. Every member is affected in a different way, and secrets galore are revealed about the Coveys and those around them. The mystery is a page-turner, while the writing is simply gorgeous.<br /><br />I have to admit that I'm glad the book description did not reveal the unique narration employed in the story. Had it been described, I think I might have avoided the book altogether. If you read other reviews and are worried that you might be turned off by the narrative voice, worry no more. At its core this book is about the love a mother has for her children, beautifully described and powerfully delivered. It reminded me of [[ASIN:0756951410 The Lovely Bones]] in many ways...which happens to be another book that I was hesitant to pick up based on its premise, but which ended up being one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />The only criticism I have with the book is that the twists and turns of the mystery could have used a little bit of straightening at the end. I had a pretty good idea of was responsible for the fire early on, and you probably will too. So it did get a bit tiring in the end to have it drag on. However, this small criticism does not in any way prevent me from wholeheartedly recommending this book to anyone who is looking for an excellent read.
1609611543|5.0|I read this book after my wife started reading it and recommended it to me.  As an engineer, I'm extremely skeptical of things that I consider 'unscientific', but decided to read the book anyway (we were on vacation and I was looking for something to read).  I've struggled with high triglyceride levels (250-370 mg/dL) over the last 8-9 years, but was convinced that it was just bad genetics since my father also has high triglycerides and low HDL levels.<br /><br />After reading this book, I decided to try my own experiment (on myself).  I had one month before my next blood test, so I avoided wheat during this period, but made no other significant changes to my diet or exercise routine.  I was surprised by the results.  After only four weeks of a new 'diet', my triglyceride levels were near-normal (155 mg/dL) and my HDL was up (above 40 ... was about 26).  This was the first time in my adult life that my lipids were close to normal.<br /><br />It's now been 4 months since I started the 'no wheat' diet.  I've lost about five pounds, almost all around my mid-section.  I would highly recommend this book (and diet) to anyone who has struggled with a history of high triglycerides.  Try it yourself and see how it works for you.  Based on my results, I won't eat wheat again (and I feel great about it!).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books!  I read them in 3 days, they were such an easy read and so captivating! I saw the movie before I read them and it just made them so much more interesting to me.  I think that these three books are wonderful!
0439023483|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is an amazingly story presented with first rate writing.<br /><br />After a series of catastrophes, with the population reduced to a tiny percent of the original numbers, the U.S. is now Panem, organized with twelve districts, each with a key industry, and the Capitol.  There had been thirteen, but the thirteenth rebelled, and was crushed.  Since the rebellion, each district must send a boy and a girl to the capitol every year for the Hunger Games.  This year, from the coal mining District Twelve, Katniss has volunteered to replace her little sister.  And the boy is Peeta, with whom she has always had a silent relationship.  And together, they enter the Arena for the seventy-fourth Hunger Games.<br /><br />Ms. Collins demonstrates an impressive understanding of the mechanisms of tyranny.  Surveillance, high technology (but not implausible given current directions of research), brutal intimidation, efficient propaganda,  control of critical resources, and gladiatorial games all figure in the Capitol's control of Panem.  Control of food and entertainment, bread and circuses, are the heart of their control and the Capitol uses both to keep the districts under absolute control.  But by the end of the book, cracks in that control start to appear, like fine fractures in a dam.  This is the extraordinary story.<br /><br />The writing is consistent with the first person narration raised in a coal-mining town where the sole purpose of education was to prepare men to work in the mines, and women to raise children.  Simple, accessible, and moving.<br /><br />And if you don't have an urge to try archery after you've read this book, you were skimming.<br /><br />A powerful story of a young woman who tries to protect her sister and defies an absolute dictatorship.<br /><br />Edward M. Van Court

B0071XO8RA|5.0|In an underground silo people work to survive. They have been told the outside world in uninhabitable  . To even speak of it is taboo. If caught for talking about it can earn you a chance to visit this outside world. Sent to polish the cameras so the living can look out on this dismal wasteland. But there are many secrets to this world. From the underground to the world outside. This is a story that may answer these questions, or will it just create more?<br />I really enjoyed this book. It has been a while since I read a sci-fi book and I was pleased with this story. I look forward to more if the author decides to carry on. For the price you can't go wrong either.

1441869980|5.0|Amazingly fast delivery. The CD is in perfect condition. I am a reader with a damaged eye. It is difficult to find fantasy audio CD's at a reasonable price. Great read, I will be purchasing the next 2 books.
1416550550|3.0|I purchased this book at our local GoodWill store.. first because it was beautiful book.. and second because of its teaser on the back cover.. I only paid 1.29 for it so what the hay.. right?? Well.. this book had really good intentions.. but the flipping from dates and people left my head spinning a little and I had to try to keep up with who it was I was reading about.  Ms. Morton gives too much away in her story telling..leaving very little for the reader to wonder about.. killing the mystery as she tries to spin it.. I agree with other reviews that Ms. Morton once again has taken from other books.. movies etc.. to lay down ideas for her story and put her two cents on them.. It is frustrating to have to read about the character from one time period trying solve a mystery that a character from another time period is also trying to solve and you (the reader) already know the answer because the author has told you.. this happen alot in the book.. I actually stopped reading this book and tried to find the story synopsis on line as I am not normally a quitter.. But unfortunaley for me I did not get lucky.. so I read the rest of the book..(well sorta) I kinda skipped some of the paragraphs.. My husand became used to hearing my grunts and sighs, and occasional \\"Come on's\\" as I read this book.. It was humorous in away. I am not saying to not read this book.. just be prepared for jumping around in time and character..
B003KJF2WE|5.0|I like the action parts for this movie, is a very cool movies that are fans of marvel studios charecters.
1416550534|3.0|I must admit I read The Forgotten Garden first and went in search of more of Kate Mortons works.. I honestly have no idea why.. I did like the Forgotten Garden..but felt it went on and on and on.. so why did I buy The House and Riverton.. I think the cover art and the time period of the story drew me once again into a story that both intrigued and annoyed me. I must agree with other reviews.. the story seems to be plucked from different movies.. tv shows.. and books.. but Ms. Morton turned them all into her own spin of tales.. This really does not bother so much as I truely wish I could feel more for her characters... I felt with the novel as I did with the Forgotten Garden that I am one step ahead of the characters (or two or three sometimes). This is a LONG novel that can get boring at times and wordy.. but I made it all the way through.. I plan to read The Distant Hours as well.. why.. I have no idea.. perhaps it will be better.. I recommend this book to read if you enjoy the 1914-1930 period and are not a romantic..
0307951529|5.0|With real life examples, key points to really bring his advice home and all of his knowledge: Chris Guillbeau let's us know that living the life we want is more than possible, it's silly not to be!  This books says to me page by page, \\"you can reinvent your life, you can do what you love, why haven't you started yet!?\\"  One of the best statements so far is it's not going to work if you don't start!  Chris Guillbeau is living the life he chooses and through his journey he is telling us how to do the same.  He asks important questions in The $100 Startup and gives the reader a chance to really decide if what she/he want's to do can satisfy a desire in the market.  There is a simplified, more realistic business plan that gets right down to the nitty gritty.<br />This isn't just a book to make you feel better and think, ya, I could do this if I wanted, it's a book that really gives you a path when you are on the verge of something great and you don't know what the next step is.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs that last kick in the butt to go out and create the future they have dreamed of.

B000002H97|1.0|I still have anger in my heart about this album, all these years later. I was a hardcore fan of Metallica. I was given \\"Master of Puppets\\" from my sister on my 15th birthday, about the time of it's release, and it changed everything for me. It took me a long time to wrap my mind around that cd, but once I did, I loved Metallica from that day forward. I went to all their shows, bought everything they had including rare stuff, and couldn't get enought of them. They were the next Led Zeppelin, the next Beatles, I really thought they were on the verge of taking over the world, and ridding us of all the MTV crap we were being fed in the '80s. That was until the day I read a review in Rolling Stone magazine in 1991, just prior to the release of the 'Black' ablum. One sentance from a bandmember (probably Lars, I don't remember though) ruined my view of Metallica from that day forward: \\"Our new producer Bob Rock, told us that if we shortened our songs and made them simpler, that we would get more radio airplay.\\" I remember throwing the magazine accross the room in disgust. That statement proved that they had sold out, and I knew it before the album was released. We were all anticipating the next \\"Kille 'Em All\\" and we got pop music. I remember receiving the tape of the 'Black' album as a gift that year, and I gave it away. I tried to like it, but it just sucked, I couldn't look past the polished smear of mediocracy that they and Bob Rock made. Many friends of mine didn't get it at the time, but I'm sure they did by the time \\"Load\\" came out and they all cut their hair at the same time. I felt betrayed, and still do. But I guess they got what they wanted. I never went to another Metallica show or bought another Metallica again.
1595827684|4.0|Art of the Mass Effect Universe is just that. It's a great book if you want to see the visual development process of how characters, locations and items (such as weapons and helmets) go from concept to final product. Seeing the evolution of Mordin Solus and the Salarians for example was very interesting. The book encompasses all three games in the Mass Effect trilogy and even provides various alteration and upgrades on certain elements as the Normandy, sniper rifles and the Citadel between games. But this is not an all out guide for the series (as you'll find for certain hooded, blade-wielding roof-runners) and there are a few omissions in the art work that may leave some fans surprised. You won't find Joker, Dr. Chakwas, Tank or even Aria T'Loak. And two omissions I found more surprising where Grissom Academy and the Batarian race. I'm sure there were thousands of sketches and final art that were narrowed down to just this one volume, and while the diehard ME fanatic out there would love two or three more books, what Dark Horse has put together is quite impressive and awe-inspiring. This is an \\"art\\" book with the emphasis being on the \\"visual\\" so I would suggest you drop by your local large book retail store and flip thru the pages and then save yourself $15 purchasing at Amazon! If you love the game series you'll really like this book, if you like the game... maybe not so much.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|This CD is a masterpiece of the cinema soundtrack genre. It is filled with passion and emotion. If this music does not stir your soul then perhaps you do not have a soul. The images on the movie screen overshadow the sound and one gets hung up on the visual and the dialogue, forgetting about the music. Listen to this and watch the movie again. You are in for a delightful experience.

0307951529|5.0|I've been a fan of Chris' material (and ways of thinking) for a while and this book, his latest, is absolutely terrific. Here are the two reasons why:<br /><br />1. He provides in-depth, close looks many business that started for $100 or less. I found all of these \\"snapshots\\" inspirational, and, more importantly, they helped spur ideas for things I could do in my own business. Since I am a huge fan of books that help me think of new ideas for myself (i.e. spur personal creativity), this alone makes The $100 Startup a must-read for me. (I also love reading all the stories that say something like \\"...and that's how this business owner took her business from $2,000/mo to $20,000/month\\" :-)<br /><br />2. Even better, Chris provides a LOT of VERY practical, step-by-step info about coming up with an idea, determining if it has value and if it's the right fit for you, and then how to produce your idea (product, book, talk, store, guide, service, whatever). That includes everything from how to have a successful product launch to how to price your product. That's getting down to the nitty-gritty, y'all. This isn't a \\"you can do it!\\" book with minimal content... this book is solid nutritious brain protein, no empty calories. :-)<br /><br />I would strongly suggest getting the first chapter free (there's a button right under the \\"buy\\" button here on Amazon) and see what you think. For me, it's Chris' best book yet.

It does have the 2D version on it as well just not on a seperate disc like you may be accustomed to.The ultra violet digital copy is a joke. I downloaded it and linked it with my vudu and coincidentally this is one of the few movies that will not play on vudu due to Sonys decision. They should have kept the digital copy compatable with iTunes.<br /><br />UPDATE after people left comments telling me that the blu-ray 3D Also has the 2D version on it as well I am changing my review from 2 stars to 4 stars even though the ultraviolet digital copy sucks.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|As a long time fan of George RR Martin's books, I had mixed feelings about a television version of Game of Thrones -- it seemed too huge and complex to capture in video format. My wife had never read any of the books, but was interested in seeing the series. I was amazed to see how well the story was distilled -- capturing the flavor and essence of the original. The casting was excellent, as were the sets and visual treatments.<br />My wife was so captivated by season one, that we bought digital versions of the first four books and have been reading them aloud to each other. We've marveled at just how much of the dialog in the video was taken directly from the book, and how well it all worked in presenting the multiple story lines running throughout the book.<br />Well done, HBO. I don't believe that any other television organization could have done half so good a job.
B005OK722U|4.0|I had seen the two hostel movies and loved them. I thought the series was over but I saw that there was a third one. I was kinda suprised. I read the reviews on here and other websites and some people bashed it although I watched it and I liked it a lot. It wasn't by the same movie company as the first one, and Eli Roth didn't direct it but it was very intense and they changed some stuff up. Like instead of being in hidden factories in other countries like the first two, this one is in the US in las Vegas. Also as you know in the first two the victims were killed in dark private rooms, now theyve turned it into a live show in a casino room, where the viewers actually bid on which deadly items for the killers to use! Very disturbing and You think one things going to happen and it would be similar to the first two but then things change. There's some pretty nasty killing scenes, and the ending is GREAT. You think its gonna be one of those films that have a sucky ending but boom! Big bloody suprise at the end. It was a good movie and id recommend it to any horror film fans. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We are perplexed by the negative reviews.  We have the Epic. Someone bought it for my son for his birthday.  He had never heard of it but he really loves it!  I have played with it for hours too!  It has 3 practice tracks plus the main track.  This gives you 4 different starting points so it doesn't get boring.  We've also found a few of our own. So far we've both gotten it into the 43 bucket on Practice A.  We thought that was the end but we figured out you can flip it over and keep going.  Practice B is more challenging.  We didn't think we could get past the stairs but my son did!  Practice C is even harder.  On the main track we've gotten to 26.  We have no reason to believe that we will not eventually beat this thing!  It sure is fun trying!
B000I186FW|5.0|I have heard much hate towards this film from parties expecting it to offer either a more political view, or more action. In short, the political ideals presented here are nothing revolutionary, but mearly meant to make you ponder about how quickly human beings are willing to sacrifice freedom for safety. Admist this out-lying message, and montage of revolution, there are several well thought out fight scenes and sly assassinations carried out by V, leading up to the films \\"revolutionary\\" climax and Matrix-esque slow-motion ending that everyone has been talking about. In a nut-shell, it attempts to be both political and violent. However, if you go into the movie with an open mind, I doubt you will be disapointed.I cant help seeing simularites between the film and what our goverment is doing to day in the name of 'Keeping us SAFE'!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i tell you what. sit down, order the set, it will download in less than two minutes and is one of the best reads i've gotten my hands on all year.  thanks amazon for such a great deal.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I love the live version of Phantom of the opera.<br /><br />Best version yet.<br /><br />I need to upgrade my TV now.
B003H9MSPG|1.0|It is a cool looking gun. It said on the box though that it shoots 35 feet. Mine shoots with the barrel on, it shoots 10-15 feet. It does not come with a bipod, making it extremely hard to snipe your opponent. Do not buy this gun.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|As excited as I was to read this book, I found it difficult to get through.  I purchased it at the end of March and just finished it!<br />It was not very moving actually, until almost the end and by that time, I had wanted to put it down several times.<br />It did show how a family is pushed & pulled apart and how they are able to come back together, but it was not enough to keep me moving.<br />I would not recommend this book.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I really enjoy this game but the fact that you need to buy tokens to level your character in later waves just to get passed is very annoying and some frame rate issues. at one stage all my saved data reset for no reason. but I have to admit that this is currently one of my best games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|[[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />I began this book with doubt that it would be anything but smut because the media had so graciously named it \\"Mom Porn.\\"  I was so curious though after my girlfriends bragged to me what an amazing novel it was.  The way it was described to me by one of my favorite friends was \\"It's like right before you get in a car accident...  You know you want to turn the car around and run but it's too late your already committed, so you just make sure your seatbelt is buckled tight and hold on as you find a way to brace yourself!\\"  I tend to agree that this book is tantalizing and a little over the edge when it comes to your classic love novel.  That is merely because this book is not your classic love novel from the dark ages, it is a modern day novel of a very troubled man who comes across a very innocent young woman and yes it becomes a very zestful but addicting love story.  This story is based in 2011 and hits the hearts of us young mothers who are the same age as the character Anastasia Steele.  In our time dating the bad boy was what each and every one of us wanted to do, and those of us who did find this story to touch all but too close to our hearts.  I finished this exceptional novel in a matter of three days, and this is only because I could not feed my addiction to Christian Grey as often as I would have liked due to the fact that I had to do normal people things....I finished this book at 0730 this morning and am over half way through the second.  This is a must read for women in their 20s and 30s anyone older.....Well I say read it if you dare, but don't go trying to ban it from the shelves in your county just because you Googled the meaning of BDSM and are appalled... LOL no it is not for everyone, not even for me, but the book is just a book and a fantasy world a woman could really benefit from escaping to.... Plus your husband will love you while you're reading this book!NOT MOM PORN!!!!  A MUST READ!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|at first I loved this game it is super addicting but then I started to get mad when people would not respond quick enough... but now I love ot so much its good and then its bad then back to good

B007V2UGPE|4.0|games a great time killer. freezes and reboots seem to be a thing of the past. cool graphics. a fantastic free app
0307951529|5.0|I've been following Chris for a couple of years. I love his quest to visit every country in the world and have learned a lot from his earlier ebooks on earning frequent flyer miles and starting a side business. This book is my favorite of his. His passion for small businesses clearly comes through as he tells the stories of entrepreneurs--many accidental entrepreneurs--as they start and grow their businesses. I especially appreciated how he shared their actual income from the business. These are not stories of people who got rich overnight, but who steadily grew a business into something that could support themselves. As with his earlier books, this is very practical. He provides easy templates for business plans, marketing plans, and even partnership agreements. I find it amazing how much good information you get for the price of a book.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app is great! Once you add the option to actually subscribe to your podcasts and recieve live updates, then I will give it a perfect 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|only thing u cant shut it down...very addicting when u sit down to play...kids love it also....enjoy playing I know we. r
B007SGM084|5.0|I read this story when it was just fan fiction and loved it!!  It sure has spiced up my marriage!!!  I kick myself everyday for not down loading it when it was a fan fic, I miss the Edward and Bella and Twilight names...but that being said I still love these books.  Worth every penny!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|they made a third world and are going to make more so stop whining already and play the game. jeez
0307951529|5.0|An excellent source of ideas for those looking to start their own ventures.  For fair disclosure I did receive a free copy from a comment on his blog but did already have it pre-ordered. If you are unsure of whether you can or should start a business this is the book to Rad. It certainly will not give you all the answers but will open your mind to the opportunity out there. I really liked how the author covered both online and bricks and mortar businesses.  Too many books these days on starting a business focus almost exclusively on producing information products this book does not.  I am an avid reader of The Art on Nonconformity blog and look forward to more in the future from Chris.
B007LX79KS|5.0|For me this series ranks up there with the bets of the best... 24 was very good... Nikita excellent...<br />as is MI-5.
0307951529|5.0|As a college professor teaching in a business program, I plan to use this book in several of my classes - it has great stories for the students who want to start their own businesses, but are not sure where to begin. It has terrific stories about how no special skills are needed (and often no business plan) to start doing what you are passionate about. I highly recommend it for undergraduate and graduate business students alike!
B004LWZW7O|4.0|I enjoyed In Time, it was an entertaining movie. At times the phasing is terrible and the movie feel a bit cluttered, it sort of make the story needlessly complicated which just leaves the movie feel rushed, but all in all this is a good movie. Now In Time will never be a cult classic, but if you like science fiction, and especially dystopian future stories then this flick might be worth checking out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it! one of my best games I would recommend it to anyone even small children can play it! love it
B0073XORCY|4.0|I'll say that overall, I (an avid Jethro Tull fan), am impressed by the collection of songs here, a few in particular, but as anyone would guess, one cannot improve on an amazing classic of 40 years past.  Regardless, this album (which is not one long song like the original) is a nice group of well-produced and nicely composed songs - with a few odd extras (a poetry reading, of sorts, being one).  For Anderson, a few are even quite catchy (as far as Anderson's work can be catchy - after all, \\"catchy\\" is not usually considered a compliment to most of us Tull/Anderson fans.  I've listened 3 times so far.  I liked it on first listen (a good sign!) and it is growing on me even more.<br /><br />My only real criticism here is that a couple songs are absolutely great and plenty long enough, but would do well to end about one minute early, as each of the two have what I would consider unnecessary addendums (if you will) to the music as long endings which really kind of take away from the several prior minutes of most enjoyable music.  Maybe the idea was to add a unique or whimsical ending to these otherwise fine gems, but I might consider doing my own mix wherein I fade before those last 50 or 60 seconds, as those particular songs are a couple of my favorites.<br /><br />All in all, if you appreciate Tull or Anderson's work, you shouldn't be disappointed by this latest effort.  If you are all about nostalgia (from a musical standpoint), you might be disappointed, as there are but a few references to the original \\"song\\" here (which ARE enjoyable, I will add - especially with the cleaner and just all-around better audio/production quality compared to days of yore).  However, if you are open to Anderson's/Tull's work, by all means its a well-spent $17 for this CD/DVD set (I've not yet viewed the DVD, which is just icing on the cake anyway).<br /><br />Aw hell, just go buy it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool game!!! my kids and i really enjoy playing this game!! would recommend to others to play the this game!
0307951529|5.0|Probably the best thing I got from this book is the knowledge that  Yes, it is possible to start your own business on a shoestring by leveraging the technology and environment in today's world.<br /><br />I liked that Chris used so many varied examples to show the breadth of different startups that people were able to create on a budget. Despite using so many examples, there are still tons of concrete tips and steps Chris gives you to take to start your business. For me, not having yet started my own business and still being in the planning stages, I found the first third of the book most useful. Still, I read the book all the way through - a couple hours a night for three straight nights (it's an engaging and easy read), to get the gist of what things to think about down the line.  I can see myself using this book as a reference down the line.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that Chris didn't just pick out examples of people going from having nothing to becoming millionaires.  Many of the examples in this book are of people making moderate incomes - 50K to 75K per year, which made this book more realistic and accessible to me.<br /><br />Several people seem to be griping about the fact that many of the businesses in the book cost more than $100 to start. Did you really think the author was going to explain that how every single type of business can be started for a $100 bill? These people are probably also upset that they worked more than 4 hours the week after reading 4 hour work week, or that Red Bull did not actually cause them to sprout wings. It's an enticing and representative title, not a money back guarantee.
