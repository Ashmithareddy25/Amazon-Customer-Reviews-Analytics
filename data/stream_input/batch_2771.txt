B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this card game.  Where your playing with two players or four.  A good pass time.  I recommend this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun.I play or hours.if you like creating stuff, do creative mode.if you like<br />Collecting stuff, do survival mode.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds.  One of my favourite games.  It takes skill and patience.  I recommend this game for anybody to play.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|great series.  never should have been cancelled. There are lots of great scenes and it was fairly accurate historically.  It was better than I thought it would be as today's people will never be ready for 100% historical accuracy as morals have changed so much.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|It's true that the sound of this CD is slightly different than what you think of when you hear BSB. But again, if you've listened to all their CDs over the past year, you'll notice that each one is different and their sound evolves.<br /><br />I absolutely love this CD and have been listening to it over and over. My favorites are Breathe, Show 'Em, Try, and Feels like Home. The guys have great voices and I'm glad they've made it this far in their careers. Will be seeing their tour in Boston next week! Can't wait!
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Not sure when I found this series, but I am so glad I did. It may have started with Dr. Who, but it is so much better!!
0736092269|5.0|Definitely recommend this book. It's a great book for looking deeper into your workouts. It shows all the inner workings of you favourites.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|When I bought this I had no idea how long each book is.  I am almost finished with book four and of course there is a fifth and I'm not sure I am willing to give the characters any more time in my life.  If you like endless scheming, entitled characters and fighting it is a great series
1480535885|4.0|This was a good book. It started off pretty slow but then before you know it you are hooked. I don't know if I would say that this is a must read, but it is good entertainment.
B0061S073A|2.0|I  like this app except it has a tendency to exit itself and kids have free reign of the kindle, it has happened to me while I was adding apps so I know they do not know my password plus my kids are 2 and 5. My 2 year old has made 2 purchases in the last 2 days, luckily Amazon's is cool and refunded the $
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works perfectly!! and the best thing is that is free!! i love to have a calculator right in my kindle fire, so i don't have to get up and look for one
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Catherine Tate holds her own against the Doctor and it is great to see her grow into herself and what she is able to do. Watching the Doctor and Donna relate to each other is fun and it is nice having someone treat him almost like a sibling.
1936608898|5.0|Love the way these two write! It's simple and straight forward. There is the science-y stuff that can go over your head. The science-y stuff is thorough enough to explain the &#34;why's&#34; good food, the right food, is the beginning of good health.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love the game and it works fine on kindle fire HD I'm only asking that on creative make a soul for each animal not certain ones
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A fun read. Easy to read and Pam is a great engaging writer. Enjoyed the exercises too! Whatever level of spiritual seeker you are, the reading and exercises will delight you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am prepared for anything thanks to this guy.  It took a bit to learn, but once you have it down you can do anything!
B00B6U63ZE|5.0|As I am preparing for my transition into a new job, reading this book has been helpful in planning for this. In reading this I was also able to reflect on successes and failures from my past and pinpoint where I went wrong or got it right.  Looking forward to implementing this new knowledge gained in no position in new organization.
B0062YADWI|3.0|works fine, snagging issue wasn't a big issue with mine and the bottle opener was very good. Never used the wrench but i would assume it would work to a degree. The only reason I gave it a lower grade was for the fact the lock mechanism broke after a while, lasted me about 6-8 months so it wasn't after short use, but for the price, it should have lasted a bit longer.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I can't wait to read more or Oliver's work. I am so grateful I decided to give her books a chance.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I usually don't review anything unless it slaps me in the face. Super Collider B***h Slapped me!. Megadeth has been my favorite band since the release of So Far,So Good...So What! They hit a peak with Rust In Peace and failed with Risk, they rose back and again hit a peak with Endgame, now Dave does this to us again.<br />Super Collider will go down in history as another Risk and a very low point in the bands career, The songs are written simple for Mustaine, the lyics are as simple and predictable as you can get. Dave has a great mind and has always had a good way with words, I expect more from him than this.<br />There is only a few songs on this album worthy of the name Megadeth and very far between. Anyone who thinks the first few albums rule and also feel the same about United Abominations and Endgame should know that Super Collider is not in the same group.<br />I don't how much I can expect in the future from Dave and Co. Its depressing to watch something you love fall from grace. I have some hope he will \\"Wake up\\" after this but really how many years they got left? If you really like the stuff like Cryptic Writings and The World Needs A Hero than this aint too far off, just a little weaker in my opinin. Better than Risk but I dont think its even close to the best they can do.<br />Now time for me to go shelve this disc and go listen to some Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?<br /><br />Later Droogies!<br /><br />P.S<br />More of my opinion on this in the Comments.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After some scrutiny and 20 listens this album does grow on you. Its still not the Megadeth I hoped for but it is Megadeth and I would rather have this than nothing. There is some good in it, It's not a lame duck like Risk but now I think it's the lyrics that seem a little \\"cheesey\\". Daves vocals sound good and every once in awhile theres a good hook. I may have been too harsh with my initial thought but usually thats the best one. Ive been finding the first and last few songs to be very catchy. I upgraded my Stars to 3 for these reasons. But... please Dave, give us one more kicker before you quit!very catchy. I upgraded my Stars to 3 for these reasons. But... please Dave, give us one more kicker before you quit!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I am always a little hesitant when trying a new author, but I immediately fell in love with Lauren Oliver. This book is a constant thrill ride.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was not able to put this book down once I began to read.  As I read, I couldn't help think how dedicated and driven these men & women are. They volunteer for the training to become the very best of the best. Nothing is ever easy for them and yet they continue to serve.  They are very special people who perform very unique & specialized missions.  We, as the country of The United States of America need to be grateful to them and their families for their voluntary willigness, dedication & tremendous sacrifices.  I am grateful for the firsthand account by someone who was there.  May God bless each and every one of these  special operators.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been playing this game for a long time and it never fails to entertain me. I get so excited when it updates, I'm like &quot;oh my gosh where will it take me this time???!!! I hope everyone enjoys it like I do. Keep up the good work!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I got this game and I absolutely love  it but ever since the update 3 days ago, it doesn't  work. It wouldn't connect to my Facebook and now it won't even load on my Kindle Fire HD. The intro video runs and then it loads and loads and loads for hours. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail. Please fix this app so we can enjoy it again.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I read through the trilogy over the span of two weeks while traveling. I enjoyed book one and was intrigued by the cliffhanger feel of book two. The characters were developing and I couldn't wait to read this. I even avoided reviews since I wanted to go in with a fresh take, but I found myself agreeing with many of the book's critics after.<br /><br />Let's just say that Hollywood chose the WRONG book to split into two films because this is just sloppy and bad. Characters that were developing are thrown into a shredder here. And it seems like character deaths are just thrown in at random moments for shock value. I believe many previous reviewers have broken it down already.<br /><br />That being said, I'll be happy if, character-wise, the final split films stray far away from this.
B000MAOLVW|5.0|I saw this movie in the old Cinerama theater in San Francisco when it opened back in the 60's. I loved it then... I'm glad to have it now.
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|I have not had a chance to use it much but when I have it has been impessive.  Looking forward to more time with Rocket Music player.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. great for brownie points. The case is very nice too.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Have enjoyed watching the show and seeing how the characters and storyline develop. Some of the episodes were a little far fetched and reaching, but overall still hooked!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton never disappoints reader.  Great story-teller who connects characters and chapters to the very end, usually with a surprise conclusion
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I watched the entire series with my daughters and we loved each and every season.  Season 5 didn't disappoint us!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not sure what the &#34;proof&#34; was.  It seemed the connection made was during a subconscious coma state and revealed more to the<br />individual about the religious aspect of life than to me that there is a place called heaven.
B00C7607FS|2.0|I ordered The blu-ray The Little Mermaid April 21st, 2013 and still am waiting for a release date today is August 5th,2013.How much more do I have to wait for this Disney movie?<br />Martha
B00AB7HESI|4.0|As a fan of the original game I decided to try out Remix for my Kindle Fire tablet.  The mobile version is is very faithful to its PC/platform big brother game Scribblenauts Unlimited.  Definitely worth the price to check this out!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is one of the best gun apps you can get! I have not yet gotten bored with playing with this app! (And I get bored pretty fast)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this was going to be some masterpiece but it really was not.  It did move along and I was surprised at times but I really did not like the ending.  Likely the hype surrounding this book caused my disappointment.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|I've been very skeptical about the remakes that have come out of Hollywood as of late, and I have to say, this one is probably one of the best remakes/reimaginings I've seen in a very long time.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is so great!! I love the facial expressions on the characters, its amazing that they can have such facial expressions as cartoons. I also love how this is not that typical of a princess movie. Its very funny and in the end [spoiler alert] they both end up saving each other instead of the heroism being only on one end. This is a wonderful movie.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Choose Yourself is a good read for anyone who is feeling or has felt a sense of failure in their lives. The author gives examples of some of his own failures in life and gives some good, inspiring advice on how and why you should never give up.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I like this game a lot, but i got as far as it will let me without paying already! Its so much fun! I will most likely end up paying for the full version soon. This game would be great for kids too, and anyone young at heart.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is one of my go to apps on my kindle. I use it to check the weather for my job and recently used it to check conditions ahead of us while traveling. It makes life much easier.Iike
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Fun game great graphics. I will buy the next one. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes matching games. Totally addictive
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took me forever to get into this book, but I kept reading because of reviews and a friend's recommendation. At about 50% it started to pick up for me. The ending was also unsatisfying.
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|The novel is a love story, truly beautiful. It relates the struggle of love, sickness and death. A reflection on life.
B00AG297GK|5.0|Of Borat, Bruno, and The Dictator, this is the only one I truly enjoy.  Bruno was waaaaay too much for me, and I have the sense of humor of a middle school boy typically.  Borat was hit and miss for me.  However, for some reason, The Dictator hits my sense of humor perfectly.  I honestly did not expect to enjoy it.  It is definitely &#34;politically incorrect&#34;, but most humor is.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I will play this all day every day. I love love love this game. I am a mega Pegasister. My older brother has been jealous ever since I got it since he doesn't have a tablet.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game gets more and more difficult as time goes on but is fun to play. I just wish that there were other ways to get coins to buy items. It does not seem that anyone ever thought about the fact that someone may not have friends that play the game nor that they are willing to pay REAL money for virtual coins! However, it really is a great game that I will play!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|So far have really enjoyed this game. A couple of The puzzles were a bit frustrating,, but in a way that you really wanted to figure out how to solve them. Hope the rest of the game is as fun.
0399159347|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I loved not only the story, but the way the story was told.  I did not see the \\"twist\\" at the end coming.  Casual observations about everyday life hit so close to home for me.  This is the best book I have read in a very long time.  I loved very word, every page.  I have read all of Liane Moriarty's other books and enjoyed them very much, but this was the far superior read.  I wish I could read it again for the first time.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|So, a friend recommended this book, and I picked it up. And I could not stop reading it til I finished. It's worth the price. The writer has a funny and entertaining way of writing. I was surprised that I actually laughed out loud during some parts. I can't wait to read the other books in the series.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love it. Can't wait to see the second and third part. Lets wait and hope those are as good as the first one.
B007EECSFA|4.0|A great story teller and was able to develop the characters so they were very believable.<br />The way the story was presented, going from the present to the past was a great way to weave the story and kept you wondering and wanting to continue to read.
B004SCRDCY|5.0|This is a great supplement to the movie and give you some insight into some of those movie scenes that just didn't make a lot of sense.  Shows how close the move was to the book as well.  There were only minor differences, but the book goes into more depth of the  families.  For instance, Michael's safety was guaranteed by Sollozo when he met Met Solozzo and McKlusky at the diner by the Bocchicchio family who sent a hostage to the Corleone family.  The Bocchicchio famly was ruthless so if Michael was killed, then the Corelone family would kill the hostage and the Bocchicchio family would kill Sollozo.  Made it very interesting.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have now read this book twice. I loved it even more the second time around. And am now working on the second book \\"shadow of night\\".
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|I guess I was expecting more, but a good guy movie. It just felt a little flat though the action scenes were spectacular.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The characters in this book give middle-schoolers a way to talk about the social dynamics of their own schools. The characters also show how cool kindness can be in a way that parental lectures never could.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i play this game so much even without wifi it is so fun and addicting  but a little hard to get sharks but i still love this game
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love watching this show. I wish I could sit and watch the whole series in one sitting. I can't wait until I catch up with the latest season
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This opens up the full page just as it is on my laptop.  Shows birthdays, ticker, etc.  I am very happy with this app
B008OOYALE|5.0|There are moments of frustration that you need more money. Overall the game is rather fun. The dragons are very fanciful and some of them are just cute.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very entertaining. I enjoy the competing part of it. I wish you could do more with your horse. More interactions would be nice.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Add it to the list of best movies made for kids and adults. Kids watched it over and over and repeat the funny lines all the time. A must have in the video collection. It's a blast to watch, non stop humor.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I  have to admit that minecraft pe is a fairly enjoyable game to play. My brother, cousin, and many others of whom I know love to play it, and would rate it a 5. I, however, agree that it is more deserving of a 3. Minecraft games are too blocky in general, and tend to distort my visualisation skills if I play them for long periods of time. Still, minecraft pocket edition has better movement/control than the pc and/or Xbox version(s), and I give it a substantial plus for that. I recommend this game to all of those who don't mind it's poor graphics like I do.
B000001ZS5|5.0|Excellent product, totally recommend it for everyone who needs and wants a product like this. Five stars to it. Thanks
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved all the book read them hundreds of times  I didn't see what was gonna happen in catching fire loved it
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Excellent product, totally recommend it for everyone who needs and wants a product like this. Five stars to it. Thanks
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Another amazing season of Walking Dead!!! I'm so siked for season 4 after seeing this. I watched the season in 5 days I'm so addicted
B00005JNQS|5.0|Excellent product, totally recommend it for everyone who needs and wants a product like this. Five stars to it. Thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|It would be better with Redstone and rails like the computer version... but over all its AWSOME!!!!<br /><br />The computer version is 27.50 and this is 6.99
1608871819|5.0|Excellent product, totally recommend it for everyone who needs and wants a product like this. Five stars to it. Thanks
B000HL2J0G|4.0|GOOD ACTION and lots of adventure  a little romance<br />and good story lines. I like this series a lot. GOOD SHOW
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Excellent product, totally recommend it for everyone who needs and wants a product like this. Five stars to it. Thanks
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved the action, humor, romance--fun Movie.  The smirk on Bruce WIllis' face and the characters of the others makes this an enjoyable movie
B00A8ECU24|5.0|AWESOME GAME my little pony is awesome  my dad had it first and I never played it but when I got it  I LOVED IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My grandkids saw this app and wanted it.  So we tried it and they are loving it!  Ages 4,5 and 6
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to get into to book. I enjoyed reading it every night. The only place I had difficultly staying with and understanding was the last 50 pages. I felt the ending of it was a bit rushed.
0394818237|5.0|my child 2.5 yo is very interested in the book and spend a long time looking at it. there are so many things happening, i find something new every time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is another great super hero game. Like the amazing  Spiderman  and the dark knight rises. Gameloft is a good quality app maker. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!
B009WUBERW|4.0|For what it is it's a basic fun to watch. Not a complex film and a great rainy day movie.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Compelling details from the lives of individuals and families over several years create a dramatic landscape of North Korea, a place of mystery for most of us.  This is a page-turner simply on the level of their personal stories, which are true and stretch over a number of years.  But it is also a worthwhile and memorable book because it unveils truths about recent history, about  a hidden nation and about the human spirit in both its failings and its triumphs.  Although North Korea is a place of incredible bleakness, this is not a bleak book at all:  There is love, death, drama, despair, courage and hope.  The thorough research that underlies this book is a great credit to literacy.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Just have to keep reading these books.  Like the way that Reacher always wins!  Lee Chilfd has got himself a winning formula here and once you've read one you'll be back for more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting it's like temple run with a cute little twist. But the best thing is that it's free!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Have only recently discovered 'Jack Reacher' and now can't stop reading about him.  Super stuff!!  Would recommend Lee Child to anyone who enjoys an exciting, pacey read.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It is ok but if you don't have a Facebook account it kinda sucks I wouldn't waste your time if you don't really like to wait
B00ARAO720|5.0|I saw the trailers for this and they didn't do it justice. This was a great movie, on the edge of your seat fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game,you can't win cause it never ends. Don't let that stop you. Great graphics and highly addictive. Works great on kindle and fire HD
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I liked the Grimm Brothers and Van Helsing when they came out, this one is an amusing twist in the same type of way. Good movie to watch when you just want to chill with an action/comedy.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is action packed goodness. First off I have never played or liked FPS games. But this game looked pretty cool so I downloaded it. AND I'M ADDICTED. The gameplay is awesome. And I have no trouble finding an online game. It also has amazing graphics. This game was a huge surprise for me since I'm not a FPS fan. I recommend this game to anyone.
B0078XMA6O|5.0|Didn't realize that this had been released and saw it on line, was an instant buy. Listened to some tracks online and then got the whole thing.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Talking Ben the dog  is fun to play and I always play it when I'm bored.also when I take care of kids
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is back as Bond and this has to be his best performance so far. Some great classics show up in this movie that will make any Bond fan happy.
B002KS1IJC|3.0|Its pretty much what you would expect, just a little too long and slow. But fun none the less. cheers.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This movie is great, almost like a Jason Bourne movie but with Tom Cruise. The bar scene had me rolling in laughter too, but the rest of the movie is really good, well worth buying.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I just finished season 1 and loved it, on to season 2.  Lots of entertainment here.  I love this show!!!!
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is great in this movie. Surprising twists in the plot keep your attention to the movie all the way through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It's great to go to when you are bored and looking for something to do. :-)
B005LAII80|5.0|I've seen 3D movies in both iMAX and normal 3D format and this has to be the best ever.  Brings Dredd back to the way he should be, not the silly version they had in the Stallone movie.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Well first you all excited because you think you get cast spells. But basically, you just do favors for people. Its kind of fun.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It was implied in all the Bourne books and movies that Jason Bourne was not the only one, and this is a great movie with Renner as a great leading action man.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed Safe Haven-I read the book a couple years ago when it came out and fell in love with the story. I think many women can relate to or know someone like the female lead, Katie, and single dads could probably see themselves in Alex. The story is encompassing and thrilling all at the same time with Katie seemingly running from the law juxtaposed by her reluctant growing relationship with small town shop owner Alex. It is a story of love and forgiveness set in a quaint seaside town with a touch of the mysterious thrown in. A must see for Nicholas Sparks fans and romantics alike!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This movie ranks up there with some of his best movies ever. Comes in as the bumbling idiot into the wrong place at the right time, but works well.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie started really slow and it was hard to see if it could come around to a good story. Ever so slowly it began to take shape as a really good story with good acting and built itself to a great ending. It was worth the wait to see how it ended.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This was a great movie. I missed it in the theatres and then when I found it to rent on Amazon and watched it twice.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Good story and well written.  The dialogue is believable.  The superb acting is icing on the cake.  Jennifer Carpenter is beautiful.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was mildly confusing at first, but well worth watching all the way through, action, suspense and an oddly entertaining plot.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I've read a lot of books that I cant even remember, but this will never be one of them.  I am not a hiker and never will be.  I learned so much!  Some of it, I wish I could forget ( the putting down of her mom's horse made me physically sick)!<br /><br />This is very different from any book that I've ever read.  I am glad that I read it, but I am glad that its finished at the same time.<br /><br />It was a wonderful example of time and distance taking away some of the pain of life!
B002SM2QDC|1.0|plot too stupid - i like fantasy/sci fi but the toys in this movie would cost more than the national debt gimme a break
B00CL8D83U|4.0|Okay, obviously this isn't a Kraftwerk album but I suspect it's masquerading as one; indeed, even the CD case looks suspiciously minimalist like Man Machine or Computer World. Consequently, this poses something of a problem in rating this album as it's tempting to give it 2.5 or 3 simply because, as a Pet Shop Boys' effort, it genuinely lacks a lot of what one would expect from them: the strong melodies, clever and insightful lyrics, dramatic ballads, and so on. But once one gets passed that temptation, the real question emerges: Is this album any good? And the answer is a resounding \\"YES!\\" (though it isn't as good as Yes).<br /><br />There is a lot to like about this album. The dances beats are excellent and virtually every song is a strong one (an improvement from Elysium that was only half-good). It is professionally produced, with a crisp, clean sound, and holds well together as unitive whole. Naturally, the album isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. In particular, two points count against a 5/5 for Electric: firstly, the tracks tend to be a bit too long, which leads to some tedious repetition in parts; and secondly, on almost every song the lyrics are anything but inspirational.<br /><br />So, what about the songs?<br /><br />1. Axis: a powerful start to the album, and the best start to a Pet Shop Boys album since Disco 3. Lyrics are practically non-existent (ironically, not every track has a vocal) but that really doesn't detract from enjoying the song.<br /><br />2. Bolshy: arrrghhh! It begins promisingly enough but then becomes incredibly painful to listen to, especially the droning \\"Bolshy, Bolshy, Bolshy, Oh!\\" Easily the worst track on the album.<br /><br />3. Love Is A Bourgeois Construct: a clever title and probably the most signature Pet Shop Boys song on Electric. The melody is catchy here and it is still very danceable. Again, suffers from a bit too much repetition.<br /><br />4. Fluorescent: superb! A great song, close to the best on the album. It combines the techno power and base from Axis with some nice lyrics. Another missed single release!<br /><br />5. Inside A Dream: coming after Fluorescent, this is an interesting song to listen to. Nothing exceptional but solid.<br /><br />6. The Last To Die: being the Pet Shop Boys, this Bruce Springsteen cover sounds better than the original. What impressed me was how they re-worked the song so that it did not seem out of place on the album. Otherwise, it's not especially remarkable.<br /><br />7. Shouting In The Evening: a short song, and thankfully for that. Challenges Bolshy for worst song on the album.<br /><br />8. Thursday: my favourite of the album. I'm really convinced that the Pet Shop Boys are at their best when recapturing and updating the 80's sound, which is why so many tracks from Yes were so good. Thursday is very 1980s, and reminds me something of Why Don't We Live Together? Alright, the lyrics are nothing to write home about, but the song endures repeated listening and puts a smile on your face (well, mine, anyway). Why isn't this a single release?<br /><br />9. Vocal: this album starts strongly, and it ends equally strongly. A very good song.<br /><br />Looking back, perhaps the only disappointing aspect of the Pet Shop Boys' last few albums is that they are yet to produce a world-class single like they did in the early days. Still, with sounds this good, there is plenty of hope. And who said they were getting old?
B00821PCJS|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because I  really like how the show pulls you in with the different characters and it makes you want more after the episode is over. Fantastic watch! I cannot wait to watch season 2.

B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Not at all what you expect . If found myself bored waiting for thr lame story line to develop,  no real reason to make this movie. Bruce should stick to the RED movies, much more entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game wouldn't load for me. I tried several times and I was extremely disappointed. I expected more from such a popular brand.
B002RT69QQ|3.0|quality is good, but not convenient. The cover couldn't be locked, and I am always afraid of breaking the SD card.<br /><br />By the way, I purchased over a year ago, but now don't use any more.

B009YU9J0E|4.0|Electronic synth pop with dark melodic Cure like undertones.  Refreshing.  Some tracks are really abstract and euphoric, while others carry a nice dance beat.  All in all, a great album.<br /><br />I hope to catch a live show one day.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The idea of a portable minecraft is spectacular. When the next update comes around, they should add wolfs, enchanting, and the ender dragon. But still, mojang has amazed us again!
B0054LRR3S|5.0|Unique beats and rhythms.  I'm not sure what genre I could place them in.  They are sort of in a class by themselves, like Bjork or Morrissey.  Some of their tracks feature Little Dragon & Sampha - which are amazing. The flavors range from trip-hip-hop newavo jazz to sultry sexy dance club beats.<br /><br />Very very good album.

140006922X|3.0|I found Reza Aslan's [[ASIN:0812982444 No god but God (Updated Edition): The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam]] to be a well-written introduction to some themes in Islamic history, culture and religion.  Aslan's writing was engaging and he offered a broad picture of the subjects which he touches, which keeps the narrative fresh without getting bogged down in technical details.<br /><br />That prior experience made me hospitably inclined toward reading's Aslan's perspective on the life of Christ.  I found that his writing style was as crisp and interesting in \\"Zealot\\" as in \\"No god but God.\\"  Aslan's introduction of his narrative through the Sicarii murder of the High Priest Jonathan was a nice bit of prose, every bit worthy of being included in a historical fiction.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I felt that Aslan fell down on scholarship. My biggest problem was the absence of footnotes.  I like to know what source documents what claim.  Aslan does provide a kind of narrative \\"endnote\\" for each chapter where he generally explained his sources. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't inform the interested reader where exactly Aslan found the exact source for his material, or where he was interpolating material or was quoting an expert on a given subject.  Aslan's approach made it virtually impossible to check for his sources on specific details. For example, in Chapter 13 Aslan tells us that the \\"Q materials were compiled in 50 C.E.\\"  Since I've never heard that anyone was able to say with any precision when Q was composed or collected - assuming that it ever actually was composed or collected since it is a hypothesized source - I was interested in finding out who Aslan was quoting for this bit of information.  Unfortunately, the end notes for Chapter 13 say nothing about \\"Q.\\" This kind of approach is a major drawback for anyone who wants to \\"pop the hood\\" and check out the strength of an author's arguments.<br /><br />Aslan's thesis is that Jesus was a failed revolutionary who was committed to a revolutionary overturning of the Judean social order.  The strengths of Aslan's approach are the fact that many of Jesus's sayings do read better when read as a straight political program, e.g., blessed are the sorrowing for they will be consoled (when the landlords and priests are made to pay for their oppression.)  Also, Jesus was certainly crucified as a kind of political threat, as \\"King of the Jews.\\" The weakness of Aslan's approach is that there seems to be far too much didacticism, taking extreme positions and mind-reading for his work to really qualify as \\"history.\\"<br /><br />For example, Aslan takes some of the latest dates for the writings of the Gospels of anyone I've seen, and he writes with a mind-blowing preciseness that I've never seen any other writer use. Thus, in Chapter 12, he advises the reader that:<br /><br />>>>Mark's audience was in Rome, where he himself resided. His account of the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth was written mere months after the Jewish Revolt had been crushed and Jerusalem destroyed.<br /><br />Aslan, Reza (2013-07-16). Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth (Kindle Locations 2392-2393). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. &lt;&lt;<br /><br />Somehow, Aslan knows that Mark was written \\"mere months\\" after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD? And that it was definitely written in Rome? That's mind-boggling since no other scholar I've ever read has claimed to know any such thing.  In fact, the opinion of most scholars is that Mark was written before the destruction of Jerusalem because, inter alia, Mark doesn't mention the destruction of Jerusalem, which was kind of a \\"big deal\\" and one would think that Christians would have played it up for all it was worth, rather than merely placing it as a passing mention in a prophecy that was typical of other prophets the Jerusalem would be destroyed for its iniquities.  The dating of Mark range from circa 40 AD, according to, inter alia, Eusebius, to 80 AD.  Aslan's precision is therefore strange, and the endnotes to Chapter 12 give not a clue as to where he gets his information.<br /><br />Aslan is equally precise about the other gospels. Thus, Aslan tells the reader: \\"The gospel of Matthew, written in Damascus some twenty years after the Jewish Revolt...\\" and \\"Luke, writing in the Greek city of Antioch at around the same time as Matthew, not<br /><br />Aslan, Reza (2013-07-16). Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth (Kindle Locations 2420-2427). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />Again, there is nothing in the endnotes that tells us where Aslan got this information.<br /><br />The dating of the Gospels relative to each other is a matter of convention, not knowledge.  Scholars have good reason for believing that Mark came first and that the author of Luke and Matthew read Mark and that John came last, and perhaps the author of John read Mark, Luke and Matthew. Since it takes time for a text to circulate and for an author to write their own text, scholars essentially arbitrarily figure that ten years to 20 years is the gap between the gospels.  The gap could be shorter and probably wasn't longer because other texts appear in the second century that rely on Luke, Matthew and John. Mark is obviously the linchpin and the issue there is whether Jesus's prophecy of the destruction of the Temple mean that it was written after the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, or before according to the statements of early church historians. So, Aslan is pushing the envelope on dating the gospels, and he doesn't share with the readers, why he makes the decision he makes.<br /><br />The late dating of the Gospels seems to be important to Aslan's project because he seeks to argue that everything which doesn't fit with his picture of the \\"war-like\\" Jesus to be a later addition of the Gospels.  Aslan is often extremely peremptory and didactic in his assessment that something is not historical or fiction.  Unfortunately, Aslan's opinions are either his own interpolations based on his thesis or projections based on a narrow range of post-modern biblical scholars. Thus, Aslan rules out any text that doesn't fit his model as an obvious later accretion.<br /><br />In that regard, Aslan makes some questionable assertions. For example, he claims that the Roman Empire became anti-Jewish as a result of the First Jewish Rebellion, which was the motivation for Christians to change the essential teachings of Jesus.  Asalan writes:<br /><br />>>>>With the Temple in ruins and the Jewish religion made pariah, the Jews who followed Jesus as messiah had an easy decision to make: they could either maintain their cultic connections to their parent religion and thus share in Rome's enmity (Rome's enmity toward Christians would peak much later), or they could divorce themselves from Judaism and transform their messiah from a fierce Jewish nationalist into a pacifistic preacher of good works whose kingdom was not of this world.<br /><br />Aslan, Reza (2013-07-16). Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth (Kindle Locations 2405-2408). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This claim isn't consistent with the fact that - as Aslan admits - there were no Roman reprisals against Diaspora Jewish communities. Moreover, after the Jewish-Christian schism in the latter half of the First Century, Judaism was recognized as a licit ancient religion, unlike the \\"novel\\" Christian religion. Christians attempted to link themselves to Judaism as a legitimate Jewish religion in order to take advantage of Judaism's licit status.  Further, the real period of Roman anti-Judaism did flare up until after the Bar Kochba Revolt in 130 AD, when Marcion would advocate taking the Jewish Old Testament out of the Christian canon.  Hence, if Aslan could push the envelope on the writing of the Gospels until the mid-second century, his argument might have some traction, but he can't.<br /><br />Aslan's next move is to pit Paul, as a Jewish apostate, against James as more traditionally Jewish.  The problem here is that Aslan doesn't seem to be familiar with the modern reading of Paul as being far more supportive and sympathetic to Judaism than most Christians - who read Paul through Luther - have been led to believe. There are some excellent books on this, such as Pamela Eisenbaum's [[ASIN:B005MWR1IU Paul Was Not a Christian: The Original Message of a Misunderstood Apostle]]. Likewise, NT Wright and others have embarked on a scholarly project called \\"New Perspectives on Paul\\" that reads Paul's letters within a Jewish context. See N.T Wright's [[ASIN:0800663578 Paul: In Fresh Perspective]].  I didn't see either book in Aslan's bibliography, much less any book that explored this perspective.<br /><br />In another didactic passage, Aslan tells the reader that Jesus's statement to Peter that \\"upon this rock I will build my church\\" is entirely non-historical. Aslan states:<br /><br />>>>The problem with this heavily disputed verse, which most scholars reject as unhistorical, is that it is the only passage in the entire New Testament that designates Peter as head of the church.<br /><br />Aslan, Reza (2013-07-16). Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth (Kindle Locations 3160-3161). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Again, the endnotes do not share who these scholars are, and I've never heard such a thing before.  I assume that Aslan got this information from \\"The Five Gospels,\\" which was produced by the post-modernist slice of biblical scholarship called \\"The Jesus Seminar.\\"  I would have been interested in seeing a discussion of his grounds rather than an incorrect statement about \\"most scholars.\\"<br /><br />Moreover, the statement is wrong.  Apart from the fact that Peter's name precedes the apostle's name in every listing of apostles in the four gospels and in Paul's letters, and the fact that Peter preaches the first sermon in Acts, and the fact that Peter receives the revelation that gospel is to be taken to the gentiles and that gentile Christians did not have to dkeep the Mosaid Law, there is also Luke 22:32, where Jesus charges Peter to strengthen his brethren, and John 21 where Jesus charges Peter to \\"feed my sheep.\\"  Obviously arguments can be made for and against any of these points, but didactic handwaiving is not scholarship. (Also it seems odd that such a \\"pro-Petrine statement as found in Luke 22:32 should come out of the \\"Paul faction\\" of Luke.)<br /><br />Also, it is strange that the subsequent historical evidence found in First Clement's (Clement's Letter to the Corinthians) doesn't support Aslan's thesis. That letter written at the close of the first century appeals to both Paul and Peter equally as important to the Christian Church in Rome, which we assume should not have been the case if there was such an antipathy between Paul and \\"James wing\\" of the Church to which Peter - the \\"nominal\\" leader of the Christian church - supposedly belonged (and if it was the \\"Paulist faction\\" that ultimately won out, why didn't it simply eliminate any mention of the role of Peter from the texts as it purportedly did to James?)<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are many interesting points that Aslan makes. I found that the practice of reading Aslan's interpretation brought out points in my own reading that I hadn't thought about, which was rewarding. That said, his thesis is not new.  I first read the thesis of Jesus as Revolutionary in the early '70s as a young teenager when I read Hugh Schonfeld's [[ASIN:1932857095 The Passover Plot: Special 40th Anniversary Edition]]. I can therefore understand the \\"gosh-wow\\" aspect of learning for the first time about how gentle Jesus was walking through a revolutionary land in revolutionary times.  I think any thinking Christian has to absorb that perspective in their understanding of Christ.  However, athinking person can't simply didactically wrote off everything else.  Aslan has done what all books of this kind have done; taken one view of Jesus - such as Jesus the Marxist, Jesus the Feminist, Jesus the Hippy, Jesus the Cynic - and used that as a sieve to remove anything that doesn't fit the model.  After removing all the contrary data that doesn't fit the model, the author stands back and - voila! - the \\"real Jesus\\" is what the model predicted.<br /><br />Aslan is not a professional historian.  His degree is in Sociology and he teaches Creative Writing. He therefore comes at this subject as an amateur with all of an amateur's enthusiasm and, pace the \\"Dunning-Kruger Effect,\\" all of the self-confident lack of nuance of an amateur. One shouldn't read \\"Zealot\\" as a scholarly work.  It is an interesting book, but anyone who reads this book should read a few more to get other perspectives, and, preferrably, those books should have proper footnotes.he can't.<br /><br />Aslan's next move is to pit Paul, as a Jewish apostate, against James as more traditionally Jewish.

There were the drugs and promiscuity (who brings 12 condoms to the wilderness??!,the cheating on her husband, abortion,shooting the horse, the whining, and by the time I read the part about her not tipping the waiter at the restaurant toward the end I had heard quite enough from her.

I did not try to watch the other discs or other episodes on this defective disc.  Returned for replacement.  Hope that fixes the problem.<br /><br />I gave it a one star rating only because the disc would not play properly.  If this is a systematic problem, I would expect other one-star reviews would mention the problem.  Just be sure to watch your copy within the 30 day return period to be sure that your copy is OK.

0544139453|5.0|I picked up Mohsin Hamid's book The Reluctant Fundamentalist after seeing it appear on one of the older NY Times Notable Books list and also hearing what a great author he is.  I was not disappointed in the least bit and found the book to be incredibly well written, fast paced, and thought provoking.  The book is about a man named Changez who grew up in Pakistan but made a life for himself in the USA after being admitted to Princeton and then getting a job at a prestigious financial firm in New York City.  He ends up being quite successful at work at the young age of 22 and reignites a flickering at best flame with Erica from college whose sickness doesn't let her fully commit to him as a boyfriend. Eventually, Changez grows discontent and somewhat skeptical of his life in NY as his homeland is facing threats from neighboring India and Erica becomes sicker by the day.  The story is told from the perspective of Changez and he sits in a caf&eacute; with a purported CIA agent and tell him his life story over a meal. I enjoyed the voice the author gave to Changez and found the novel to be quite stimulating on many levels--including reiterating in my mind the perspective of many towards the US.  A very good read and although several years old still quite relevant in terms of subject matter and likely will be for many years to come. I highly recommend it.

159463176X|3.0|I absolutely loved The Kite Runner and when Thousand Splendid Suns came out, I thought there was no way his 2nd book could match up to the 1st.  I was pleasantly surprised to love TSS even more than TKR.  I count them both in my top two favorite books of all time.  Needless to say, I waited years for his 3rd book and ordered it right away.  Unfortunately, I really struggled to get through it and often would leave it unread for days if not a week at a time.  The other two books I couldn't put down!  Like many other reviewers, I thought the story had promise at first.  However, the story went in so many directions, going into great detail of characters that are ultimately never brought back in.  The little boy that lived in the Shadbagh castle, the Greek doctor - there is no conclusion to either of those plot lines.  I am sitting here wondering why they were ever included?  I am confused as to why anyone thought this was a compelling story and frankly, really disappointed.  Ultimately, it was an ok book, but I definitely wouldn't highly recommend it.

I hope that the Director's Cut is released on DVD someday, so we can see what their vision for the film was, before Miramax decided to re-edit it in order to make it similar to the first movie.<br /><br />As released, though, The Crow: City Of Angels is a sub-par sequel. Worth seeing only once. Vincent Perez did a good job as Ashe (his French accent and sinistrous voice were perfect for this film) and Mia Kirshner was under-used as Sarah. I wish there had been more than just a brief passing reference to Eric and Shelly. Thuy Trang was also under-used as Kali. And what was the point of Sarah befriending the little girl if the girl was going to remain on the streets?<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the profaning of God'a Name (ie. combining the Name of God with a mild profanity).<br /><br />Rated R (strong violence, language, including several uses of a religious profanity, and some nudity).

0062255657|5.0|I honestly tried to write a plot summary, but every time I try, the words come out clunky and stupid. Who would be interested in the book I was trying to summarize? How does my plot summary do justice to the beautiful book I hold in my hands?<br /><br />So, if you really want to know what this is about, do yourself a favor and glance at the plot summary on the cover blurb. For once, the blurb is supremely done and accurately depicts the contents of the book.<br /><br />There are times in your life that you can feel great change is happening - change so huge that the person you will be in the next few moments will be completely different than the person you were in the not-so-distant past. And now, after reading my third Gaiman book, fourth Gaiman work, I am that person. I am a Gaimanite.<br /><br />How did I hide myself away from Gaiman's loving prose? How did I avoid reading any of Gaiman's intricate stories? Why did it take me so long to break down and read his books? Why did I continue to read all the same books with different names and physical descriptors when I could have been reading a new Gaiman book, where each world is vivid and brilliant, filled with magical characters and wondrous adventures?<br /><br />I know this comes across as gushing, but I just can't stress enough how tiresome reading was getting for me pre-Gaiman streak. It seemed each book I opened was basically the same book I had slammed shut in frustration. Weak, wimpy characters. Insta-love. Lack of world-building. Terrible writing. Poor packing. I swear to God, authors must have gone to the \\"Mega-Bestseller Book Random Generator\\" to create their schlock. Different names, brown hair instead of blond, exchange \\"zombies\\" for \\"vampires\\", and voila, you've got a bestseller - right?<br /><br />And then the dreaded thought: maybe I didn't like reading anymore. Maybe I grew out of that hobby like I did collecting Star Wars action figures (which I did mostly because all the figures are the same ones I already had). Or playing Rock Band (which I stopped doing mostly because my TV wouldn't sync up with the guitar). Or collecting pogs (do people even sell pogs anymore? Is that still a thing?).<br /><br />This crushed me, this thought that maybe I wasn't meant to like reading anymore. I've been reading since second grade, when I forced my parents to take me back to school so I could pick up my book I left on my desk (it was going to be a long weekend, and I couldn't be without my book!). Yes, I went on hiatus around the time I started college, but by around 2007 until today, I've avidly read probably 100 books a year. Most of my home library are books I am eagerly awaiting to read. To learn that you don't like reading when so much of your life is based upon it - well, it's like having to relearn who you are.<br /><br />Thank God for the friend who lent me the \\"Stardust\\" movie. Were it not for that charming movie, I would never have bought \\"Stardust\\" the book.<br /><br />Thank God for the friend who said, \\"Hey, Neil Gaiman is doing a booksigning downtown. Wanna come?\\" Were it not for her, I would never have had this wee little book in my hands.<br /><br />Ah, this little book! After hundreds of words blathering on about all the crappy books I've read and my mid-life reading crisis, we can finally get to the meat of this: my review of \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\".<br /><br />This book is like every Gaiman book I've had the pleasure of reading. It's charming. It's witty. It's clever, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful, adventurous, magical, and poignant. It makes me nostalgic for my childhood. The characters stir at my heartstrings. The stories resonate within me.<br /><br />Basically, it's what every author should be aiming to write - and what most authors are FAILING terribly at writing.<br /><br />This is not to say this is a perfect book. I'm not so much of a fangirl that I am blind to Gaiman's faults. It's kind of horrible to think of the memories that thischild/man must carry with him (if he does indeed remember - something that the final chapter hints may not be true). I don't know if it's because of the viewpoint (a child looking into an adult's world), but the magic is confusing, seemingly whatever it needs to be at the time.<br /><br />OK, so maybe I can't really think of any faults right now. That's not to say they aren't there, just that when push comes to shove, I don't see them. I don't see them because the book is SO GOOD, so beautiful, so BIG that I am enveloped in it.<br /><br />So maybe this isn't worth 5 stars, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway. I enjoyed the hell out of this book. I rediscovered my love for reading. And I found a new favorite author, a man who is able to create new fairytales, for young and old, without compromising characters and world-building and prose.<br /><br />I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Hell, maybe in a few years, I'll be poking holes in it like I do with lots of other books. But for now, it was just what I needed.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman, I love you! You have totally restored my faith in authors being able to write interesting, beautiful stories and rekindled my love of reading. Thank you!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

140006922X|1.0|I read with interest Mr Aslan's book, as this topic is near and dear to my heart.  The book was disappointing in that there was nothing much new to be learned about the life of Jesus, and much of what is written is untrue or regurgitated from previous sources.  If readers are seeking a truly innovative perspective on the life of Jesus, I strongly suggest they read my book entitled \\"The Way of Yeshua\\" which is available on both Amazon and Kindle.  Please forgive the self-promotion, and at least read the book description to see if it suits your interest.  Thank you.[[ASIN:1484093925 The Way of Yeshua]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers if a fun game you all i recommended it for everyone you will love it funyou little kids anjd adults to
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|Let's cut to the chase.  If you are a sadist, you will enjoy this movie.  If you gain arousal of some sort by seeing people self-maim in grisly fashion, you will love this movie.  If, on the other hand, the prospect of 1.5 hours of bad over-acting and pointless violence for the sake of violence (totally cleansed of any true horror aspect, suspense or, indeed, story) sounds like something you can do without, then by all means spare yourself the tedium of sitting through this turkey.<br /><br />But, I know you're saying, the original Evil Dead was classic cheap horror that launched a sub-genre and the career of Sam Raimi and friends.  Certainly I'd want to see what an updated, budgeted version might be able to add, you might say.  For this is what I said, and I wish somebody had been there to correct me.  It's not just the 1.5 hours of my life that I won't be able to reclaim - I could spare that.  And it's not the utter desecration of a franchise that managed to create genuine horror thrills with a wink and a laugh (I have no doubt this movie will be forgotten along with remakes of other horror classics).  What is truly depressing about this pile is that somebody thinks that <spoiler> sawing your own arm off with a power knife or licking your tongue into two on a blade or slicing off your cheek or stabbing somebody in the eye with a syringe etc </spoiler> is actually \\"entertainment\\" - and obviously, some people here would agree - they are ENTERTAINED by this heap.  For that's all that is on offer here - mutilation sewn together with only the most tenuous of plot devices, loosely derived from the original AND POORLY AT THAT!  That's the real shame - they were given a genuinely thrilling base plot to work with and said \\"Nah, we'd rather just up the gore\\".  To name this movie Evil Dead is kind of like when they repackage lousy foreign knock offs with deceptively similar names - \\"Space Wars\\", \\"Henry Porter\\" - except in this case, for reasons unknown, the guardians of thebrand said \\"Sure, make whatever dung you want, we'll give you the rights to the name\\".<br /><br />I just hope that somewhere out there a real Necronomicon falls into the hands of the makers of this loaf and it summons, not demons, but angels of basic taste to expose to them the true horror of the bilious bad film-making they've dumped into the world so that they can go forth and redeem themselves with sack-cloth and ashes upon their shaven heads.  Unfortunately, it's more likely that they are being rewarded with a bigger budget to remake Evil Dead II.  I'll be sure to miss it.

The dancing was good and you can tell that the cast worked many hours to make it look as effortless as it turned out.

B00574P9EQ|4.0|I was skeptical about this movie due to it being a sequel but was happily surprised after I watched it.  The rivalry between the two main characters was so funny and believable.  Great family movie for those with adolescent children (at least 8 and up).

159562015X|2.0|I had technical difficulties while taking the test (my computer kept hanging up resulting in skipped questions).<br />However, their program won't let you retake the test. Very annoying! The only way (I guess) to be able to do it over is to get another code by buying another book.<br /><br />Update -<br />I sent an e-mail message to their client support group, and they responded the following day with instructions to allow me to retake the test. I do appreciate their willingness to bend their rules.<br /><br />However, I object to the way they've structured the test-taking experience: You are only given 20 seconds to respond to each question, and the FAQ answers are not available until after you've taken the test. This is because they want people to go with their first responses, rather than overthinking their answers; but I think that not knowing how the test is scored can skew the results. For example, they do not count neutral answers in any way, so you are scored the same whether you feel that both options are strongly true for you or that both are strongly false. This is based on their supposition that if either choice is truly meaningful, you will be able to pick one as slightly more true for you than the other. Since the choices are often not opposites, I don't believe this is the case. Had I understood the scoring method, I would likely have chosen one or the other to ensure that at least one of my beliefs would be acknowledged in the results.<br /><br />I agree with the idea of working with people's strengths. I do not agree that this is the best way - or even a good way - to determine what those strengths are.

B00DGNO3WE|4.0|This is one of those films that Anglophiles will love. The script is well written and the cast is top notch. Quartet reminds me a bit of the British television series &#34;Waiting for God&#34;--except with music! The story does lapse into sentimentalism here and there, so it's not a perfect film, but it's still very much worth watching
B009RH9HDS|4.0|Nice cover. The standing functions are good. Good protection for the Kindle. However, it is rather bulky and heavy when  holding in your hand (look at the shipping weight).

006114665X|4.0|Historians embrace centennials of major historical events, and Christopher Clark's description and analysis of the diplomatic events leading up to the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, and the rapid development of diplomatic and military events during the month of July is probably the first of a large number of scholarly works that will appear over the next five years.  Two specific aspects that Professor Clark develops is the &#34;normalcy&#34; of violence and assassinations within Serbia itself, and especially that which pitted the two claimants to the Serbian throne -- the Obrenovichs and the Karageorgivichs; and secondly, the significance of the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913.  The Balkan Wars, which brought an end to Ottoman Turkey in Europe, resulted in breaking a diplomatic and political lowest common denominator that the European powers had respected since the end of the 1820s, &#34;to keep Ottoman Turkey alive but weak.&#34;  The premise being that it was understood that the breakup of the Ottoman Empire would pit the European powers against one another, which would lead to a war among them.  Essentially that is what happened leading up to the Crimean War, 1854 to 1856, the result of which continued to keep Turkey intact.  As a teacher, where would I place Clark's book as a useful read for college undergraduates.  First, it's a hard read without some preliminary background.  Second, it is not as useful as Barbara Tuchman's &#34;The Guns of August,&#34; which covers a much wider chronological period going back to the Dual Alliance between the German Empire and Austria-Hungary.  It is in this regard also that Germany and Kaiser Wilhelm come out looking somewhat &#34;innocent&#34; in this account, while Russia, Serbia, and France bear the brunt of the culpability for the outbreak of the World War I.  It is not unlike the tone that George Kennan takes in his &#34;Fateful Alliance,&#34; in describing the concluion of the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.  Lastly, how did Professor Clark receive permission to expropriate Herman Brach's title &#34;The Sleepwalkers,&#34; in his anti-war novel?
0316010669|4.0|I thought that Blink was pretty entertaining and taught me some things I didn't know before, but I liked Outliers more personally. Blink shows the power and importance of the subconscious mind, and it's imteresting to see what this subconscious truly reveals about us. I didn't think this whole work was as unified or organized as Outliers, which is why I rated it a bit lower. The Tipping Point is up soon on my list of books to read, so I look forward to that.

Having been pregnant myself, I've never heard anyone tell the story from my point of view, but this movie did it and I laughed until I cried!  This shows all the views; the mother's views of ecstatic, oopsie, adoption, miscarriage, I'm fat, you name it.  It also shows the dad's point of view which was awesome.  There are quite a few big names in this too. I really enjoyed this and recommend it.
0143119680|4.0|Diana Bishop, our protagonist, is a witch descended from Bridget Bishop - the first witch executed during the Salem Witch Trials. The daughter of two witches, Diana is orphaned young and denies her powers, becoming an academic and studying the history of alchemy. While performing research at Oxford, Diana inadvertently calls up a magically protected book that has been disguised as an alchemical text. She returns to the book but draws the attentions of more creatures - demons, other witches, and vampires. One vampire in particular, Matthew, takes an interest in protecting her. He is the incipient centuries-old, overly-protective, over-aggressive gentleman vampire that I wanted him to be. Matthew is secretive and possessive but he also brings a scientific viewpoint to the story that I enjoyed as he studies the genetic relationship between witches, vampires, and demons.<br /><br />The storyline is captivating but many of the details of day-to-day life become tedious and difficult to follow while major plot advancements proceeded at a rate that left me wondering about what had just happened. My real problem with this book is that in the end, it goes nowhere. I read this 592 page book and NONE of my questions were answered. I am going to read the second book, so hopefully I will finally get some of the answers to the questions that started in the first 50 pages!<br /><br />Reading this book it is abundantly clear that Harkness is a historian and while I enjoyed the connection to the `real world,' she made many references that had me searching the internet to look up some obscure historical reference. I loved the way that the author tied in information from alchemy and genetics.Overall, I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down, even though I sometimes found it difficult to follow. If I had received a sense of fulfillment at the end of this book, it would have gotten a 5/5.

B003Y5H5AG|4.0|I'm in my fifties, and I use to watch The Smurfs show on TV when it was in carton version.  I loved Gargamel, but especially Azreal his cat.  The movie version looked interesting, so I bought the DVD.  The human characters were good, and the acting was good to, but the stars had to be the 6 little 7\\" smurfs, that stole the show.  Granted I wanted the movie to be in the medieval times as the cartoon version, but the plot was interesting.  My only disappointment, New York,  WHY New York? but, Ok I digress. Anyway won't go into plot of movie.  Gargamel, Azreal, and the Smurfs stole the whole movie for me. Exciting, had a good moral for everyone in this movie. In it's funny brought the whole family devotion and importance in to being without being preachy. Saw another whole side of Smurfet that I never knew.  I always wondered why only one female smurf for 99 male smurfs.  OH WELL, story for amother day.  Anyway watch this movie, very enjoyable and a great lead-in to a sequel that I knew was coming.  The human actors were pretty good to not well known characters, but were talented enough to carry it thru.  Will be watching the sequel when it comes to DVD soon.

He is a boring soul but that all changes when Gandalf shows up out of the blue. Bilbo is asked to go on an adventure with the dwarves to take back their mountain. (Which was taken from them by smaug the Dragon). The dwarves believe smaug is dead and set off on their quest. Along the way they face a number of twists and turns no one could have seen coming.<br /><br />Blue ray- leads to the greatest HD picture ever captured on film. The picture's so vivid you can see the sweat on the character's faces! The beautiful scenery of Ireland only adds to the experience, drawing you in through the HD image so clear you don't think it could possibly be more beautiful in person.<br /><br />The extended edition- is a must for any true fans with amazing new features and footage never before seen! The statue that comes with is a great collectible to add to your collection!<br /><br />Recommended- I highly recommend the hobbit to any one who liked the lord of the rings or epic adventures in general. The plot is amazing completely living up to my expectations set by the lord of the rings trilogy. The character growth in Bilbo from the start of the movie to the end is awe inspiring!
B001BYLFAS|5.0|Funny movie.
1118488768|5.0|David Meerman Scott keeps updating each new edition of this book with fresh intel from the front, and he does it with great clarity, tremendous insight, and engaging storytelling. Highly recommended. Buy this book.
B004LWZW24|5.0|It arrived on time and it's exactly what I ordered and plays just fine.  I recommend this to anyone whom wants to watch this movie.
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|This is the best game in history!!! It can end in many different ways. It needs a lot more mechanical robots in it. But I still think it's awesome!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy Facebook as I live cross county from my family and a lot of my friends.  It keeps me up to date on what is going on with them.
0385347774|3.0|This is a hard book to rate. I wavered between two and three stars. The book starts out interesting and until about two-thirds of the way through remains interesting--lots of back and forth, which leaves the reader wondering who is telling the truth and what has really happened. However, the build up to the ending takes an unbelievable turn and the story goes down hill from there. I read that the author struggled with the ending and unfortuantely, it comes through in the book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was captivated from the very beginning.  Khalid wrapped me in with his descriptive words and me forget I was reading at all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|All you could ask for in a calculator app, it looks and works great. Also totally stable and easy to view ... like the full screen implementation.
B000K14LTA|3.0|I thought I was a savvy shopper, obviously not.  I did not note that this was a Region B movie.  It would not play on my top of the line, Sony Bravia Blue ray DVR.  I have never returned anything to Amazon but it was a wonderful experience.  I received the movie late Saturday evening.  Immediately went online to return and by Monday afternoon the Fed Ex guy showed up WITH a return label.  My internet had been down and I couldn't print the return label.  Also on Saturday I immediately ordered the regular DVD extended director's cut with the 4 discs.  If you order the blue ray extended director's cut you can't get the extra discs which is really what I wanted.  I was very confused when I read the reviews as they have added reviews for the other products.  I thought I had ordered the blue ray extended director's cut with the 4 discs--that product DOES NOT EXIST.  So if you want that, you have to buy the blue ray extended directors cut AND buy the regular DVD with the 4 discs which ends up being very pricey.
B003O86FMW|5.0|People said this one is boring but I think it's just as brilliant!! It keeps you craving for more!!! Can't wait to see how it ends
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Great book kept me interest the whole way through, very heart warming and touching to every reader. You will not disappointed
B0036FYO12|5.0|Fantastic film from the 70s that still holds up. Redford is fantastic as is Dunaway. Unlikely this film would find its audience these days.  Highly recommend.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Great book, but having all four combined is a little hard to navigate on an E-book (though I'm new to E-books, so maybe I'm just not doing it right).
B004HYDL1K|3.0|I usually don't watch the Over The Top (OTT) and totally unrealistic action movies for that reason and the simple fact that they usually don't have well written stories. I have grown quite fond of Rodriguez's works like Dusk till Dawn and Desperdo. So I gave Machete a try and was not disappointed and was glad to see him take on the immigration issue with this story. This was kind of a tongue and check approach to the hot button issue with the somewhat (I say somewhat because some politicians act this way) over dramatic roles from De Niro (Sen. McLaughlin) and Johnson (V. Jackson) as TUFF AMERICANS AGAINST illegals. This while they are being bankrolled by a drug cartel for campaign funds and toll money for crossing his land with drugs and illegals. With our political climate in the shape its in it's not hard to make the transition. The action is good and over blown with larger than fantasy characters that are either dirty and corrupt or righteous and ready to take action. The acting is good for what they're roles are and as nut jobs they do a good job. I loved seeing Trejo getting the hot girls and the Mac 10 sub machine gunning girls (reminds me of videos you can buy) sweeping the parking lot at the end where the two sides collide. Danny prefers his Machete to more comventional weapons for his fights, but he doesn't mind a mini gun mounted on his hog to clear cagers (cars) or bad guys out of his way. All in all a fun watcch even though it does deal with a very important issue that needs to get taken care of for everyones sake. You can't go wrong here with pretty girls, guns, action, humor, gore and with a story to tell. 3.7 stars.<br /><br />Rating 0 to 5<br /><br />Story = 3<br />Acting = 4<br />Direction = 4<br />Gore = 5<br />Violence =5<br />Sex/Nudity = Yes/Yes<br />Foul Language = Loaded<br />Entertainment Value = 3.7

B00280LYHS|5.0|It is the greatest book to end the 1 series and I  can not wait for the the house of Hades to come out,this book is simply awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game you get stuck on it with out even knowing 1hr passes.  only down fall it glitches sometime and usually when your doing your best.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|it is realy fun to get old pic from old negative strap that were used in old camera<br />it is cheap priced<br />fun<br />very easy to use<br />and i love that small LCD screen in it<br /><br />and yes it works well by usb in our home computer directly without any other power source ^_^
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this case.  I charge it at home (must use your own charger, none included) and throw it in my purse.  Whenever I'm away from the home I know I can get a charge.  Works about two times before it needs to be recharged.  Last for days.and it's a great way to carry my head set when not in use.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|almost a hypnotizing game if you just want to relax. starts off easy then can quickly get challenging.  the free pack is all i needed
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Overall it was a good book. The perspective shared in this book, is however from a fairly elitist point of view. The average hard working woman may not be able to relate to quite a few aspects of this book. There is a lot that the author takes for granted. Sheryl has been afforded a lot of advantages, thereby making it a bit easier for her to lean in that it would be for some of us.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Just saw this great little thriller with Aaron Eckhardt. While the story is a little bit derivative of other thriller plots you may have seen, this is still a great film, exciting as heck, with some great acting from Eckhardt, and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Basic storyline is an American Expatriate father caring for  his young teenaged daughter living with him in Belgium. He is working for a corporation as a security expert, and takes his daughter to his office one evening (after he uncovers something the day previously that has him puzzled), all traces of the company he works for, the employees he worked with, and his own employment are erased from existence.  THe next hour and a half involve him figuring out what the heck happened, and why, all by way of chases, shootouts, fights, and good old fashioned intrigue?<br /><br />This is a very good film that I would recommend if you like the the thriller/spy motif.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Somtimes I find it hard to understand the caller.  Fun game though, I will continue to play the game to see if it gets better.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|was looking for a horse game app for my tablet, this one installed all right, but I couldn't get it to play through more than basic scenarios, and no help screens. Not intuitive. Sorry!  Keep trying.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|OMG this book is so good I love it  it is very emotional  and very happy I love it!!!!!!!! <3
B009NQZVKG|5.0|very intriguing premise - makes you stop and think. There is a lot of science that for us non-scientist types is mad easy to understand along with a great deal of historical background.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It's a pretty decent app, not too complicated or anything. If there are any better alarm clock apps, hook a girl up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a different game for anyones taste....cant wait to unlock all the games and see what else is on here I'm sure you'll love it to
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie because of the great actors and the plot.  The fight scenes were incredible and making the story line more modern to today's happenings will create a whole new following.  Well done.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Neat game!  Very clever hidden clues!  Can't put it down! Should be able to buy extra clues. If you can, I haven't figured that out yet!
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|My daughter is a big fan of Sophia the First. Having the DVD come with the lyrics on the screen helped her learn the words and recognize the words as I teach her to read.  I enjoy watching it with her and the characters.
0875428940|5.0|I like this deck of cards.  The artist makes the artwork comprehensible so that by studying the images on the cards you can glean the meanings of the cards with a little effort.  The cards are sturdy, but easy to shuffle, even though they are a little on the big side.
B00DU74U74|4.0|i did not see as much publicity on tv for this movie. I could not get into the book. However, I had no trouble falling into the storyline.  I enjoyed the movie and was surprised to see a great cast including William Hurt.
B000FC130E|5.0|I've been to London only once, but I've been to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles.  Every city has more going on underneath the surface than can be seen at street level.  This book will leave any reader with a new view of what may lie beneath the subways, and a new understanding of what lurks above.<br />  Neil Gaiman's books, and his special vision have never disappointed me.  This book will become a classic, for in it we get to see inside the human spirit with a thoroughly engaging story of what we might be, or should, or should not be.  Gaiman's fantasies are more real when one is engaged in them than seamy reality could ever be.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I really enjoyed Seth and Barbara's interaction on screen. They were both funny, serious and portrayed the characters very well. It was nice to see them offer advice, learn from each other and move to new and better things.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|Good show. Fine Acting too. This show about a show was interesting in the fact that there was such a control issue going on. You could say that Truman's life was not his own..he had his own personal God. Then God got trumped.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Every minute of this show is nail biting.  The seasons keep getting better and better.  I can not wait till season three in New Orleans.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I liked the story and it was well written, but some things just didn't add up.<br /><br />The first thing that didn't seem right was &#34;enders superior tactical thinking skills&#34;. Really? no one else could come up with the diversion and sneak attack? Come on now that's like the first thing to do, maybe the 10 years needed to learn it, But the adults should should have that as the first strategy in the play book, does no one play competitive games?<br /><br />Second, what was the point of the brother and sisters part? (once again nobody else came up with the same reasoning?) I don't get why they were important to the story.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|low power, fast, great graphics for internet browsing running Ubuntu, first ever Radeon for me, bought mostly for playing online video, completely satisfied
0061122416|5.0|What people are saying about how the main characters lack depth is true, but for this story, characters don't need that type of depth because that's not what it's about. I'm calling it a story because that's exactly what it is; it's as if it could have originally just been a fable meant to convey a life lesson, but was expanded into a longer, more meaningful story. The characters aren't meant to stick with you, the lesson is, so it's not necessary for them to be too detailed. This really is a great story, the ending made me smile. This is a story people should keep in their back pockets.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to figure out.  A quick way to fine the books of the bible easy.  Very easy to read!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Killer is the first book in a series of Max Larkin mystery novels. It reminded me of Judas Child, which was another mystery I really enjoyed. Time Killer is very unique. There are no other mystery or horror novels with similar relationships between characters, not to mention the killer's motive. I'm not sure where Thiede got the ideas that went into this book, but they are very creative.<br /><br />Jesse really added to the story. Max was, in many ways, your typical mystery protagonist: experienced detective, tough, clever... but Jesse came out of nowhere. She is a strong female figure, a detective just starting out who is very observant. Her clarifications and explanations of the crime scenes leave you thinking wish I could do that. The relationships between characters in this story are unique and written in such a way that they are interesting to read about.<br /><br />*spoiler alert* One thing I didn't like was that the killer wasn't one of the main characters. There was no shocking \\"I can't believe it's him!\\" moment. But he is connected to the two main characters' past, so I was not completely let down. Some parts of the book were a predictable, sure, but it wasn't very obvious. You certainly won't be able to figure out the whole plot in the second chapter. I was disappointed that the watch Max remembered didn't ever come into play in the story, although that is just a small detail that didn't detract from the story.<br /><br />The editing isn't perfect - at the climax of the story, you read: \\"Give me another reason blow your head off!\\" There are also extra commas sprinkled throughout the novel. Not enough to really distract from the story, but enough to be annoying.<br /><br />One of the most unique aspects of the story is Jesse and Max's relationship. I was definitely expecting a somewhat cliched ending with Max and Jesse getting together. *spoiler alert* That doesn't happen!<br /><br />Different from any other mystery you will read this summer, Time Killer stands alone: a complex, fast-paced story that will leave you wanting more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love it!! Easy to understand and use. I highly recommend for beginners who is not familar with internet games like me.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|After watching Downton Abbey I didn't think I was going to like this as much but I really think the characters are great and it is just as good.  Love it!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie, leaves room for sequels. Well acted, and plot is simple with a few twists. i.e. entertaining. Good for free.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|It's fun to use. However, it would be nice if I could set the image I created as my wallpaper. Other than that, it's great.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it is so fun I play it all the time it's so beast watch this I thing I am good
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Absolutely wonderful there are not many movies that I will watch more than once but this one is a must see. I just can't say enough good things about this .Really enjoyable and touching.
B008XFB86Y|5.0|A little bit of plot and lots of action...just how i like my Kung Fu movies. TWO WORDS, WATCH IT!!!
B00138H876|5.0|I think so. I've been listening to Dylan since his first album (about 50 years), and this my be my favorite.<br />I think you either love Dylan or hate him. If you love him like I do, I'm sure you have your favorite album.<br />Throughout the years, Dylan has reinvented his music time and again.<br />'Blood on the Tracks' was written and recorded at a time when he was going through a divorce, so it's a bit melancholic. BUT; his voice never sounded better. His story telling is at it's best. And the melodies are sweet music to the ears.<br />If you like Dylan even just a little, buy this album, you can't go wrong.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I had this game on my pc. Glad to have it again. Good graphics and interesting story. Very few glitches
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is fine, operates just as well as the iPhone version. Much better than the mobile website. Not bad.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|It really enlightened me as to what we don't know about what we eat.  Definately<br />changes how you feel toward some foods (meat especially). Will pass this on<br />to friends and family who would like to see it.
B00AYHKOZU|3.0|For a middling effort like this. Frankly the songs all bleed into one after awhile. Add on the minimalist artwork, and the question &#34;why bother&#34; comes to mind. I'm probably overrating it with three stars, if truth be told...
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Loved it,couldn't wait to turn each page.Was wowed by surprise ending!<br /><br />Great book,look forward to reading her other novels,as well.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This author puts an interesting twist on a post-apocalypse earth.  Since I read so much I usually drop a book from my mind as soon as I've finished it.  Not the case with this one.  Although I've not read the sequel yet, I definitely will.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so freaking much I recommend everyone gets this game it so fun my nephew plays it and loves it all the rest of my family plays it and loves it so all you people should get it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can control any TV with my laptop or iPad.  I can browse the internet while the laptop streams almost anything to my TV!  Good clear audio and picture.  I'd pay twice this much for this gizmo!
0743486285|4.0|I was slightly disappointed in the product because it arrived with a section of pages missing : from pages 64-92 were not there...However, I did like the book .
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Great movie. Absolutely love it. I still remember the very first time I watched this movie. Make sure to have a nice quite night in ok, that's my wife typing not me. But we both love it
B0039TAHMA|5.0|It was great to go back to the experience of Lord of The Rings, and the presentation was without flaw.
B00AMOOD8E|5.0|I love having copies of the LIttle Miss/Mr. Men books in my Kindle library.  It's great to always have a couple of these children's classics on hand when I'm traveling with my kids so that even if I've forgotten a book, I have something to read them on a device (Kindle, iPad, smartphone) and these are terrific because they're the original versions so my kids treat it like reading a regular book, and it's one less thing to pack/carry when we are on the road.
0399159347|5.0|It makes no sense to me that Liane Moriarty is not a household name. She writes books that are funny, suspenseful, emotional, insightful and move like a freight train.  I found her for the first time when she wrote What Alice Forgot, and immediately after loving that book, read the rest of her backlist.  Hypnotist's Love Story was a little bit \\"less than\\" her past books - I liked it, but didn't love it.<br /><br />Well.  Maybe now the world will find her, because The Husband's Secret is Liane at the top of her game. I won't recount the plot here - I'm the 101st review, so you can get plot from others - but I will just say that one thing I love about her books, and it's true this time, is the way they RESONATE when they're done.  With \\"traditional\\" chick lit, after you read the book, it fades away like cotton candy on your tongue.  Liane's stories, and yes, The Husband's Secret, always have some weight to them; you realize when it's over that even as the story races along like a freight train, with suspense and humor, she is simultaneously mining a deeper thematic vein.  In this book it is the nature of marriage itself - the role of secrets, what to do when the first blush of love is gone, what makes a relationship work and not work, what are you prepared to give up for a relationship.  What's wonderful is that she doesn't propose one single answer, or a right answer, but explores the issue through a lot of different lenses.  You read her work and wonder - what WOULD I do?  What SHOULD I do in this situation?  It's emotionally insightful.  (And did I say funny?  Funny.)<br /><br />Earlier this year \\"Me Before You\\" by JoJo Moyes became a breakout success.  This book is in the same vein to me:  insightful, suspenseful, emotionally complex, funny, unexpected.  I hope that Ms. Moriarty gets the breakout success here that she has long deserved.  (And if you loved this one, read her others; they're just as good!)
B00AEBB63U|5.0|I love having copies of the LIttle Miss/Mr. Men books in my Kindle library.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This is a good movie, although I would not have gone to see it in theatres.  For home viewing, I found it to be entertaining.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am not one to pay attention to the grammar or actual writing style of an author but only post reviews on whether or not I actually enjoyed reading a book. That being said, I really enjoyed reading this book.<br /><br />I am sad that Sookie is leaving us (since True Blood is nothing but Vamp porn) but thought Charlaine did a great job of finishing the story. Everyone ended up where they belonged.
0385472951|5.0|I am a Grisham fan and have read all of his books.  This one did not disappoint.  It was a good read.
B000069HZP|3.0|The Game was an interesting movie. I really like David Fincher, and the movie is suspenseful and very well-made throughout..... until the ending. The ending, I thought, was probably one of the worst ways it could've ended, and it kind of ruined the movie for me. If you're going to watch the movie, just know that after all the great buildup, the end will let you down.
159463176X|3.0|I was so excited to be reading Khaled Hosseini's long -waited third novel. I'm nearly through with the book and am sorry to say that it is not nearly as entertaining as Kite Runner or Splendid Suns. I would rate it as just so-so. The book spans three generations and at times is difficult to follow. The story lines are not terribly exciting either. Maybe book four will be winner!!!
B001TODOCM|5.0|This book arrived just in time for my trip to Ireland. It was packed in a very eco-friendly manner in a form-fitting cardboard. So happy to receive the book, in excellent condition.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie appeals to the little pirate in all of us. The story, props, characters, and effects combine to create an adventure that parallels the dreams of so many children (and perhaps a few adults) all over the world. This is a &#34;must see&#34; movie for the entire family.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I really like it. It's slim and gets the job done. Better than the otter box which I had before
0061906220|5.0|My 6 1/2 year old granddaughter read most of this book by herself and read it to her 4 year old sister and me.<br /><br />I was informed that this exact same book is at preschool and the kids love it. They could almost recite the entire book without opening it too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for children. Adults will enjoy it also.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|I like really scary movies and this didn't fit the bill. There were a few parts in this movie that made no sense to me whatsoever so I was disappointed to say the least.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman novel, and will likely be my last. I just did not like this book at all. It's marketed as an adult fantasy novel, but it's novella length and read like a children's story. The narration was flat and I never connected with or even liked any of the characters. I wish things in the story had been explained; I left the novel feeling like I didn't know any more about what had occurred than I did during it. If it hadn't been so short, I'd never have been able to finish it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I am looking forward to reading more of Orson Scott Card's books! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction novels.
B00821OX98|5.0|Think the movies &#34;The Road&#34; and &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; and you have this series in focus.  Noah '[?] from ER is the main character, who is a professor that is leading a group of humans against the invading aliens.  Every episode includes a battle between humans and aliens.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was a great game until it just stopped working. I had it for a couple weeks, then tried to open it one day and it just keeps &#34;loading&#34;. Very disappointing since we got pretty far. =(
B0026WJEWA|5.0|I taught Vonnegut in my classes and this one is #2 [behind God Bless, You Mr. Rosewater.  The author's son, Mark, was hospitalized for schizophrenia; here Vonnegut wrestles with the causes of madness; &#34;bad chemicals and bad ideas.&#34;
030758836X|1.0|So many pros:  Excellent plot, clever, witty, creative, kept me guessing and thinking, great writing, all the makings of a fantastic read-  Until the end.  To say I was disappointed and frustrated would be an understatement.  I was so freaking mad, so much so that I regretted reading it altogether.  It was like building anticipation for a vacation or fun day destination, hearing everyday how exciting and fun it's going to be and then when you finally arrive you find that it is the worst and most boring place you have ever visited. I was simply amazed that such a talented writer with such a great story was not able to provide an equally exciting ending...SO disappointed.  :(<br /><br />A few things throughout that I kept thinking that would happen never did and that was a huge let down.  I don't want to mention specifically what I am talking about because I don't want to give anything away, but because of my \\"detective\\" like personality and logical thinking, there were things in the book that the detectives could have done (or investigated) to prove the guilty person's guilt and none were ever mentioned or considered by the police department or the antagonist.  These were smart characters and none of them thought of any of the things that I thought of (one in particular) that I would have done to prove the truth-  and it most certainly could have been done, or at least been attempted, but wasn't.  I was surprised that the detective that Ms. Flynn worked with to get accurate information never thought of these things that I did.<br /><br />With that said, still, if the ending would have been as good as the rest of the book I would have given it at least 3-4 stars. Because of the terrible ending I am sad to say that I convinced my daughter not to read it.  Tragic.<br /><br />To those that don't like the \\"F\\" word, it is used repetitively.  This did not influence my rating at all, but I just wanted to mention it as a courteous warning for those that are concerned about language.  :)
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It's an easy game it's okay for a free game wonderland and the color scheme and they told me that it was good
0783114893|2.0|\\"The Hitcher\\" is not a bad movie. The performances were adequate, and there were more than a few tense scenes. But the movie is not a fantasy--it is a thriller. The amount of disbelief the audience is required to suspend is therefore unreasonable. I can believe that a young man would pick up a hitchhiker who would turn out to be a psycho. I cannot believe that two parents would pick up the same raggedly-dressed man and allow him to play in the backseat with their children. I just cannot believe that two parents would be that naive and irresponsible. (The director should have filmed the family pulling a trailer, with Rutger Hauer's character peeking out of a window, unbeknownst to the drivers.) When C Thomas Howell's character discovers their bodies by the roadside, it is almost anti-climatic. The family are candidates for the Darwin Award. Instead of throwing up, I wished Howell's character had exclaimed \\"What did you expect?\\"<br /><br />There are other problems with the movie. For one thing, the killer is omnipresent; he pops up everywhere. Maybe the killer is familiar with the area and knows that it is so sparsely populated that there are few places C Thomas Howell can flee to. But it happens so often that it ruins the suspense. Near the end of the film, when C Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh are taking refuge in a motel room, you just know Hauer's character is going to show up. You know that he'll appear in the motel room without making a sound. When he finally materializes, there is no surprise because of his record of ubiquitous appearances. Then there is a chase scene that is totally fantastical. Howell is hounded by police officers on a desert highway, who shoot at his car. I couldn't figure out if they were trying to kill him or disable his vehicle, but they fail on both counts, despite peppering his car with shotgun pellets. Somehow, Howell manages to outmaneuver them, causing their cars to overturn, while Hauer (monitoring the action nearby) shootsdown a police helicopter with a revolver. Another thing the movie never explains is how Rutger Hauer is able to kill so swiftly. He murders a bunch of deputies at a police building while Howell is sleeping and escapes from a prison bus after he is captured, but the film never shows us how he is able to do these things.<br /><br />This film is just too unbelievable to be a truly great thriller.

B003G4W49C|4.0|A very unusual story that is well written with multiple mysteries unfolding throughout.  It made me want to read the next story, which I did.  It was not as good, but still worth the time.

B0097C8XL0|4.0|This is a pretty cool game I love it but sometimes it not as fast as I thought it is also in Speed but I thought is a very very fast . You can get cool people and there's not a pro version that you have to pay for I hate those because they make the first one bad on purpose so you for the pro version that might not be worth buying .
B008220BLG|5.0|I loved the actors in this movie and the whole idea that there's hope for even a zombie to find love...sweet...
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I've never purchased any of Kelly Clarkson's music before this album.  I've liked all of Kelly's songs that have been on Top 40 radio, so when this album showed up on my recommendations list it was a no-brainer.  The album is fun and features the solid repertoire of Kelly's career thus far.  I thoroughly enjoy the album and as a result I might venture into giving her other albums a go.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It changed at every chapter.  A real page turner.  Very good book for discussion.  And the ending .... what happened after.

140006922X|1.0|Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the infamous filmmaker of the notorious YouTube trailer insulting Muslims and Mohammed, said this during an interview just six weeks ago:<br /><br />\\"It is not [a] religion movie,\\" he said. \\"I have a lot of Muslim friends and not all the Muslims believe in the terrorism culture. Some of them believe in this culture. That's why we need to fight [against] the culture, not the Muslims.\\"<br /><br />This is just ironically echoing this writer's sayings on the road while promoting his book:<br /><br />\\"Let's be clear, this book is about Jesus the man, not so much Jesus the Christ.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's about the historical Jesus, not the Christ of faith.\\"<br /><br />\\"The single most important thing, is that he was a Jew. Not a Christian.\\"<br /><br />The book is marketed as something about the historical Jesus, a violent zealot, by a religion scholar. The writer also stressed many times his wife and mother are both Christians, and his brother-in-law is a Christian pastor.<br /><br />If the book is self-clear that it's a historical narrative with objective views, which happens to be written by a Islamic scholar, why do you need to use a similar defense point as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula?<br /><br />Now, about the book.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, the writer cites Mark 10:34 to depict Jesus promoting violence against Rome, with the author's selective literalism, as one of the main arguments of the book. Ironically, the very verse right before 10:34 is just about \\"everyone who denies me (Jesus) here on earth, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.\\" and the whole chapter is about receiving Jesus' messages, maybe the writer agrees or not, followed by Jesus' warning of religious differences and struggles in an interfaith family, also maybe in the writer's family or not. It's hard to think this is what a scholar who claims his 20+ years of studying NT would do.<br /><br />The book is truly well crafted with very creative writing styles. Forexample, on page 2, the writer uses 43 words to describe his re-conversion back to Islam by losing faith twice.<br /><br />The book has been criticized by many of his peers, including religion scholars, journalists, former journalists, fact-checkers, about many obvious historic and factual errors in the book, and many things seems not so scholastic or professional. For a more serious review I found Professor and Dr. Greg Carey's piece is relatively fair.<br /><br />Finally, for the atheists in five-star reviews on the Amazon for this book: such hypocrites. This is what the author said in 2010 criticizing evangelical atheists about a slogan on a double-decker:<br /><br />\\"THERE'S PROBABLY NO GOD. NOW STOP WORRYING AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE.<br /><br />What the new atheists do not do, and what<br />makes them so much like the religious fundamentalists they<br />abhor, is admit that all metaphysical claims ... are ultimately<br />unknowable and, perhaps, beyond the purview of science.<br />That may not be a slogan easily pasted on the side of a bus.<br />But it is the hallmark of the scientific intellect.\\"
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|SIDE EFFECTS is a harrowing story full of pharmaceutical abuse, psychiatric deception, financial trickery and the ugly side of human behavior. While it is NOT a \\"feel good\\" movie, it IS a well acted and well written film that will command your attention throughout, continuously surprise you, and leave you unsettled.<br /><br />Jude law plays Jonathan Banks, a psychiatrist treating Emily Taylor, a woman who deliberately drove her car into a wall following her criminal financier husband Martin's release from prison. Upon her release from the hospital she agrees to visit the doctor regularly and take anti-depressants to regulate her moods. As one might guess from the title, it's these \\"side effects\\" that will drive the plot of this movie.<br /><br />My personal advice here is to avoid reviews that want to describe any more of the plot...writer Scott Z. Burns (THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, CONTAGION) and director Steven Soderbergh (ERIN BROCKOVICH, CONTAGION) really pack this film with intrigue, switchbacks and double crosses, creating such a series of claustrophobic twists and turns that it's difficult at times to know who's the victim and who's the villain. That's a lot of the fun, and not knowing what lies ahead makes this a delicious agony to watch.<br /><br />As for the acting, I really believe this is one of Jude Law's better roles; he really gets to demonstrate a wide range of emotional stress. Rooney Mara, too, gets to demonstrate a different side of her than she demonstrated in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  In fact, the entire cast is first rate with Catherine Zeta Jones and Channing Tatum rounding out the central foursome. They are, in a word, terrific.<br /><br />The well-written script is particularly effective as a dynamite thriller yet never seems particularly implausible. Soderbergh has made a history of creating films that wallow in \\"uncomfortable\\": SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE. TRAFFIC, ERIN BROCKOVICH, AND FULL FRONTAL were all films that looked at the world frankly and seemed at home in the midst of prickly marriage, legal, and other relationship issues. At the heart of so many of his films is the matter of truth and lies, the dynamics of their confrontation, and the aftermath of such collisions.<br /><br />Soderburgh has often declared that he is giving up the game; he has said the time is soon coming when he will relinquish film-making to the young. After a movie as good as SIDE EFFECTS, one can only hope it's another instance of not being entirely truthful. The man has a \\"true\\" gift.kly and seemed at home in the midst of prickly marriage, legal, and other relationship issues.

0823015017|5.0|Wish it had more about technique though.  It's great for color ideas but it doesn't share too many techniques showcased on the pages.
B005544V6A|5.0|This series is great.  I chose it knowing nothing about it but was immediately taken by the setting, tone, characters and quality of writing.  I saw two seasons in one weekend.  It is a great show.
B002SM2QDC|5.0|Having been a fan of the G I Joe franchise since they were first introduced this film was no disappointment.  The action was great and the technology amazing.  It captured the teamwork that the story embraced since the beginning and demonstrated the loyalty each team member has to each other and the team as a whole.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I bought this for my son, He said it works great he love the distance, sound and the way it works,  He said this in great when he is on a job.

B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|The disco age was never my thing.  I'm glad Daft Punk is trying new things.  But I walked right into this album without any research or previewing, walking right in with 'an open mind' got 13 beautifully regurgitated 1970's disco music themes with cheap retro electronic voices.  I'm sure this album is for the nostalgic people out there that think embracing the 70's disco scene is great -- and more power to them!  But I should have previewed all the cuts on this before wasting 12 bucks.  Lesson learned.  I wish I could get my money back.  Keep up the 'good' work Daft Punk but next time I will kick the tires a little while to make sure it's something more my style.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|dont buy this now i cant get more games hay at leest its free and i hate how all of this stuff is locked
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This is certainly not in my best picture category.  The acting was so so, the plot was weak and this formula has been done over and over again.  Wait until its price is reduced then rent it then or just wait for it to come out on NetFlix<br /><br />Thanks
1451624468|5.0|I think Lawrence Krauss is a great scientist with a brilliant mind, and I do believe he has written an excellent book that will bring inquiring minds pretty much up to date with the state of particle physics.  That said, I also believe he is a rank amateur in the field of theology, and I wish for his sake and other's that he would spend some \\"earnest\\" time learning the fundamentals of that area before he truly contemplates committing to the atheism he seems so glibly to embrace.  For all his fervor for the detached scientific approach to understanding where we stand in the cosmos, he seems impishly silent, and a bit intellectually dishonest, when he argues for there being \\"empty space\\" from which a universe can be spawned.  He more or less admits to this fact in the book, acknowledging that nothing really isn't nothing, but the very fact that he says as much demonstrates that his theological stance is a weak one indeed.  Still, I believe his beautiful explanations of the revelations of the world's greatest modern physicists and astronomers warrants a five-star rating, even if the theological special pleading, most of which is only a distraction, is pretty lame.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce's latest album has a much different feel to it, compared to Magic or Working on a Dream, and I would have to say that I really like that different feel.  Working on a Dream was alright, it had its moments (Working on a Dream & The Wrestler to be particular), but Wrecking Ball has tons of songs that I enjoy listening to over and over again.  I really like the sound that comes with this album, as it has that almost marching/Celtic beat in the back of many songs, and that beat just seems to fit perfectly in the backs of the songs.<br /><br />Right from the starting track, \\"We Take Care of Out Own,\\" starts the album off right, and ending the album with American Land, is just as perfect.  This album has tons of hits, that unfortunately won't be number 1's for Bruce, and this album is just fun to listen to.  The redone Land of Hopes and Dreams was a nice added touch to the Wrecking Ball, as it seems to just fit the whole theme of the album.<br /><br />If you are a Bruce fan and your following over the last so many years [because of Working on a Dream, The Seeger Session, Magic (for some)] this album should rejuvenate your interest in him because of great tracks like: We Take Care of Our Own, American Land, Death to my Hometown, Wrecking Ball, and Shackled and Drawn).<br /><br />There are some good music videos for this album that you should check out, that is if the album is of any interest to you.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I would recommend it to those who enjoy drama type of movies. I enjoyed the read and need to watch the next season!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|love it/ i play it day in and day out/ Cole def did his thing on this album/ clever lyrics/ dope beats
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was by far one of the best ones yet I can't wait to read Mockingjay. I love the hunger games.
B007QUUJMG|1.0|This book has been compared to Catcher in the Rye, but there are few comparisons to make. This is a coming of age book, yet the main character doesn't actually come of age. It is a much flawed book with it's many cliches: teen suicide, teen pregnancy, loss of  virginity, teen love, teen mental health issues... Yep, this one has nearly all of them. None of the characters are particulary likeable and despite all the cliches, nothing really happens.<br /><br />A large problem with this book it that the novel unfolds in a series of letters written by the main character. As a result, it has far more in common with We Need to Talk About Kevin (another book that I found tedious).<br /><br />Better books with similar themes are Silver Linings Playbook and the wonderful Jasper Jones (a book that actually is comprable to Catcher).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. it is so fun I love the battles I love the homes and going up stares.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A very nice well thought out app, although i do like this one i prefer a different app for my note taking deals
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Title says it all. I'm in my last year of law school and I really enjoy this show for the simple fact it gives legal theories the real life applications they deserve.
1476733953|5.0|I have been a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre since I was old enough to read novels. WOOL is among the best of them; It does not follow the standard survivirs-picking-through-a-barren-landscape formula. I loved it (and the follow up novel, Shift). I am looking forward to DUST.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This series is a great lesson in not stereotyping people.  The heroin turns out to be far more complex than anyone thinks.  I have read the series 3 times and enjoyed each reading.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I think the &#34;Die Hard&#34; producers were trying to save money this time by shooting in Moscow and environs. If memory serves, they used mostly Russian and Eastern European crew to save additional money. The whole production probably cost them 60% of what they'd have spent in the U.S.<br /><br />I  wish our U.S. actors would have our backs (the backs of the U.S. crews) by putting it into their contracts that they will not appear in any film that is helping bust the IATSE and associated unions for film and video crews. I know that'll never happen but I dream of the day where our work reappears and the work is protected by our laughable government (regardless of political affiliation).<br /><br />This movie wasn't bad and the FX crew had a field day. Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis.
140006922X|1.0|Aslan seriously glazes over the diversity in scholarship. He says, \\"For every well-attested, heavily researched, and eminently authoritative argument made about the historical Jesus, there is an equally well-attested, equally researched, and equally authoritative argument opposing it.\\" What a massive overstatement and generalisation. Exampled further by what he says later on, \\"The very brief outline of Jesus' life and ministry presented at the end of the introduction to this book represents the view of the vast majority of scholars about what can be said with confidence about the historical Jesus.\\" Who is this vast majority of scholars that he is talking about? I would sure like to meet them and read their work. Because as far as most of us know there is no such vast majority. His statement here: \\"Long gone are the heady days of 'the quest for the historical Jesus,' when scholars confidently proclaimed that modern scientific tools and historical research would allow us to uncover Jesus' true identity,\\" really just shows how Bultmannian he is in his thinking and how he is so blithely unaware of the so-called \\"Third Quest\\" of the historical Jesus. Of course that term is ambiguous and is not fully descriptive of where historical Jesus studies are heading today<br /><br />the writer cites Mark 10:34 to depict Jesus promoting violence against Rome, with the author's selective literalism, as one of the main arguments of the book. Ironically, the very verse right before 10:34 is just about \\"everyone who denies me (Jesus) here on earth, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.\\" and the whole chapter is about receiving Jesus' messages, maybe the writer agrees or not, followed by Jesus' warning of religious differences and struggles in an interfaith family, also maybe in the writer's family or not.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|great movie love it at the movies and need to own it. It's a kids film but it's good for Adults also.<br />My husband and I don't have children and we love this movie.
B00CFSWMYM|2.0|I love Feel It Break - it was my favorite album of the year. I've listened to \\"The Choke\\" and \\"The Beast\\" endlessly. Needless to say, I was really looking forward to Olympia. Unfortunately, after five plays, nothing stands out. \\"Hurt Me Now\\" and \\"You Changed My Life\\" are okay, but I can't find anything interesting about the other tracks. Sorry Austra...
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|This game might be entertaining for a five year old, but was much to slow and boring for me. Could be because I played just a couple times, but I was not intrigued enough to bother trying again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you love Bingo, you'll love this game.  It's fun, fast and very addicting.  There's many ways to win points and other power plays to make the game more interesting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book showed the true meaning of overcoming difficulty and hardships in a life-like contest. It was great!<br />I found no flaws, and all was well.
B008CRC506|5.0|nice job only on disc 2 and can't wait till the end. Hope it keeps up the great story line not that great on the music and show tunes of some they should really do some broadway skits up to scale<br /><br />\\
1439181780|5.0|This book is very motivating.  It is easy to read and not too long and drawn out so you loose interest.
145210655X|5.0|This is hilarious for Star Wars fans to look through: great references to lines from the movies and good illustrations.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm going to have to joing the majority here and say that this book was horrible!  It was obvious the author was struggling to keep the story-any story-going.  And the ending???  I thought I was missing some pages or something at first.  I was very disappointed in this book and probably will not read the next one (if there is one? would hope so after the ending on this one!).  At least 50 Shades wrapped up nicely in the final book.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I normally avoid any movie with explosions and violence but a friend said it was good and had humor.  My wife and I watched it and found it to be funny and very entertaining.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|I think I finally found another great series to read! I loved this book! It made me laugh out loud quite a few times. The romance is great, plot is good, overall it was pretty awesome.  Now offense to the author because obviously I like her writing, but there were a few times in the beginning where I thought I wouldn't like it because honestly it could've been written a little better but I still very much enjoyed it
B001HN697M|4.0|Although I enjoyed the film, I have one comment to make that is negative. Like so many of the movies of its kind, the dark scenes are sometimes a hindrance to the action going on. There should be a way to convey the darkness without destroying the action. Aside from that one factor I thought the movie was a full of action and the story carried well throughout.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|This one is livelier than the first.  Hope it stays free<br />.  Dislike getting so far and then paying  more money.  Like HU games through big fish.
159420411X|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. It talks about prediction in very interesting areas: base ball, finances, earthquakes, terrorism, etc.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Well written, acted and directed for a comedy if this nature.  The characters don't fail you, the concept is funny and carried well throughout the movie.  There is a lot of language, so do not confuse this for a kids' movie.  Don't take it too seriously and you'll get plenty of laughs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A series worth watching. Great writing, unforgettable characters, and superb acting. The British know how to do drama. I can't wait for season 4!!!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|It was a little long, but overall a good movie.  The other reviews are in depth so I won't get into all of that.
B00BWHZI0C|5.0|This is one of the best CD's of the summer. a definite must have of you don't have it already.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Everyone compares everything Tarantino does to Pulp Fiction.  This movie is more like Inglorious Bastards.  The movie is well thought out.  Just when you think everything is cool....BAM!!!  Watch it.
B00BU18U82|5.0|I don't like spending that much time playing a video game, as its addictive when started I have a very difficult time putting it down.
B000T46O52|4.0|I had to watch this for a law class.  I had seen it when it first came out but didn't appreciate the movie.  It has great acting and the storyline is a good one.  Overall a good movie.
0060392584|5.0|If you are a fan or just curious as to why someone acts the way he does, read it. This book will catch you and keep you. His twisted youth and crazy teens brought him on the path to epic success. This is so far into the realms of grotesque at times that it will haunt you.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I bought this for my mom and she loved it.  Looks very nice and looks like I spent a lot more than I actually did.  A must have for any Sound of Music Fan.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|This is the second time I ordered Jurassic Park-someone borrowed the first one and my grandson was devistated--we all love it!!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I love Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.  This movie was way too long but it was good.  I did laugh several time, mainly because of the insanely off the wall things they say rather than the movie having any sustainable comedy.  Overall a good movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have tried then all. This is what I have remained with! I am using it on my Kindle fire'  Samsung tab-Samsung phones
B00CCEHYO2|3.0|Many would hate me for trashing this record, but sincerely is not as good as previous albums, it lacks of melody and structure. The early works were more melodic. This time around Scale the Summit relay on  heavy riffs, which are ok, don't get me wrong the album is good, but prefer more melodic tune like the Collective
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|My husband and I love the Die Hard series but were very disappointed with &#34;A Good Day to Die Hard.&#34; It lacked the substance of the others.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not a fan of scary things so no Stephen King books for me.  My son told me about this one was good.  When I found it was about the President Kennedy I decided ti try it.  This was the first book I read on my Kindle.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Paramore's self-titled album sounds like their earliest work, but much more matured.  There is a lighter vibe to this selection, including three ukulele interludes that are a guilty pleasure to listen to.  \\"Fast In My Car\\" is an incredible opening number that is enjoyable to drive a sing with.  The single \\"Still Into You\\" is poignant and relevant.  My other favorite is \\"Ain't It Fun,\\" which has the musicality of an anthem and appeals to all.  The other track in need of attention is \\"I Hate to See Your Heart Break,\\" which is a truly different change of pace, but fits well in the track listings and can be enjoyed thoroughly.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Now waiting on Season 3 discount, Season 2 was very good and we hope Season 4 upcoming is better yet.

B0065RIJ3W|5.0|This book got me into this new, fascinating world of aquaponics.<br /><br />Previously, I've had interest in building hydroponic systems. However, the hassle of concocting the proper nutrient solution, the procurement of the multiple raw chemicals needed to do so (specially in a country in economic and industrial turmoil like mine), and the disposing of the old, mineral laden water kept me off.<br /><br />Now comes this concept of using fish to provide the plants' nutrients... pure genius! not to mention the fact that you add another crop to your system, the fish themselves. Hardly a new concept, actually, the Aztecs (and probably other indigenous peoples of the Americas) had &#34;chinampas&#34;, and rice growers in Asia have been sort of doing this for a long time, but the modern way reflects a deeper knowledge of what makes the whole cycle work.<br /><br />Mrs. Bernstein's writing paints a clear picture on the whys and hows of the whole system, plus her design, after scouring the web for testimonials and experiences to corroborate, seems to be the way to go in order to successfully start in aquaponics
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is a classic musical, which I have seen a few times in the past. The quality of the production is superb. Now that I have the CD, I expect to view and enjoy it many more times in the future.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a very well done film, portraying an important 'slice' of history during the most important part of Lincoln's Presidency when slavery was abolished and the union was preserved.  Events leading up to The Thirteenth Amendment passing, and the Civil War ending were portrayed accurately and movingly. The acting was absolutely brilliant, and all heart. You felt as if you were there! Those complaining about the rather often drab and dark lighting in certain scenes are clueless. There was no electricity back then, and building interiors were heavy on window treatments as well. Spielberg accurately reflected the visual surroundings, which included proper interior light levels for the time. Don't miss this excellent film about one of our greatest Presidents!
B0049VZ222|5.0|Heard people talk and talk about the show and finally decide to see what the big deal was.  I was pleasentally surprised and just love the fact that I can watch it any where and any time with Amazon download.  Great Show.

B00B935SUY|5.0|I decided to watch a free Prime Eligible offering one weekend and browsed the \\"Most Popular\\" and this came up.  When I saw Dave Grohl was involved (drummer for Nirvana, guitarist and vocalist for the Foo Fighters), I was further intrigued.  What a GREAT documentary this was!  It turns out that a lot of legendary and famous albums were made at Sound City Studios like Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\" and Foreigner's first self-titled album (just to name a few).  The key to all of this was the expensive purchase of a recording console created by an electronic genius by the name of Neve.  This Neve console was one of only four created in the world.  At a purchase cost of $75,000, this recording console cost more than the recording studio owner's home.  Along with this incredible analog recording console, there was something magical about how drums sounded upon being recorded at this studio.  Metallica chose this studio to record their recent album \\"Death Magnetic\\" upon being presented with four drum recordings from various studios. Although many hit albums were recorded there in the studio's heyday, as the recording industry gravitated to digital recording the studio fell on hard times. That changed when Nirvana recorded their groundbreaking album \\"Nevermind\\" at the studio with a budget of just $60,000.  Following the multi-platinum success of that album, other artists wanted to record there once again.  With that second wind of the studio's popularity, the advent of the digital age and Pro Tools definitively put an end to the studio's financial viability. Artists that recorded at and admired Sound City studios appeared throughout the documentary such as Fleetwood Mac (Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were the first to record on the Neve console), Tom Petty, John Fogerty, Neil Young, Stephen Pearcy from RATT, Lars Ulrich of Metallica and Rick Springfield. Former employees, producers and engineers also appear, many having moved up in the ranks career-wise from their tenure at Sound City. The most delightful footnote to the sad closing of the studio was that Dave Grohl purchased the Neve recording console!  Dave feels very sentimental and loving towards that console as he and his band Nirvana recorded \\"Nevermind\\" on it.  The cameras follow the reverent transport and installation of the Neve console to Dave's recording studio, Studio 606.  Once installed, Stevie Nicks, Trent Rezner (Nine Inch Nails), Rick Springfield and Paul McCartney record original music using the recording console.  Dave Grohl mused how he became famous because of recording on that console, and The Beatles were his major influence for becoming a musician. That day when Paul McCartney recorded a song at Studio 606 was truly \\"Nirvana\\" for Dave! This documentary was such an entertaining, moving and interesting piece that I highly recommend.so appear, many having moved up in the ranks career-wise from their tenure at Sound City.

140006922X|1.0|The new book Zealot by Reza Aslan (another attempt at revealing the \\"historic Jesus\\" that contradicts the Biblical account) has gained much attention in popular media.  I watched the Fox interview here and became suspicious about the books legitimacy without even having read the book.  I know we have been told not to judge a book by its cover but is it ok to judge a book by its author?<br /><br />Immediately the author became defensive when asked the question why a Muslim would be interested in Jesus.  Call this a red flag but when a person responds to a question by misdirection some thing is up.  It is like a criminal who was asked where he was while the crime was taking event.  Instead of providing an explanation that would clear him he engages in misdirection and opens a discussion about something irrelevant to the question.  In this case Aslan goes right to protecting his credentials as a \\"Ph.D\\" as a \\"scholar\\" etc.  In my opinion this question could have been a great opportunity to do two things: first, he could have provided an answer to win legitimacy for the work and secondly, if done well he could have dismissed any suspicion about his motives as a Muslim writing about the historic Jesus.<br /><br />Repeatedly through the interview Reza restates his credentials over and over like a montra.  Maybe he is impressed by them but for most of us outside of the ivory towers we want something like compelling substance before we run right out and buy.  It doesn't matter how many abbreviations one has in front of his name if he isn't making sense.  Moreover, academia also functions in this same way.  Interestingly in spite of his admiration for his academic credentials his book wasn't published by an academic publisher.  Why not?  If this is truly a piece of unbiased scholarly inquiry why not share it among is peers?<br /><br />After watching the interview with Fox News I attempted to look up Reza Aslan to give him the benefit of the doubt in my mind.  What I found was it was difficult to learn anything about his credentials.  I went to his web site then to his faculty web site at the University of California Riverside and found nothing.  I was expecting to find his four degrees in New Testament, Biblical Greek, maybe a PhD. in History that he boasted about or maybe a Curriculum Vitae.  No such luck.  However, I did find a post<br />\\"Snickering at FoxNews while getting duped by `Zealot' author\\" that explains the author overstated his claims.  This actually explains quite a bit about why the interview was so strange.  So the question is if he is willing to overstate his claims about his credentials is he also willing to overstate his claims in his book about the historical Jesus?  I think i'll pass on this one.<br /><br />[...]rn anything about his credentials.  I went to his web site then to his faculty web site at the University of California Riverside and found nothing.

0553801473|5.0|Book 5 continues to follow all your favorite characters. Complex plot, as in the first four volumes, but you can't stop reading the 1000 pages in this volume. I am sorry I didn't begin to read the books until I had seen the HBO series. The HBO series is extremely well-done, but you appreciate it more when you have read the  details of the plots and subplots that are impossible to capture on a series, even one that is as well written and acted as the HO series.<br /><br />The entire  five books are very dark. They makes Hamlet look like My Little Pony!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|So many songs on this cd that I love but may favorite is &#34;To Be Loved&#34;.  Such a meaningful song of what love is all about to me and of course sung by Michael Buble makes it very touching.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I first listened to this book as an audio tape borrowed from a friend, then read the book.  Reading it worked much better because the chapters change in time - covering a number of years - and the book is not consecutive.  Trying to listen to the book didn't bring this across as clearly as reading it.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the book ends.  I throughly enjoyed the bits of wimsy, the mystery, the love story, the adventure.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|My 4yr old loved it so we purchased the upgrade. Very enjoyable. Very easy for her to navagate and play

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|very surprised to see so many negative reviews, and all back to back.  odd.  loved this book.  i love that the story hasnt ended yet.  isnt the point of reading to immerse yourself into the story and not want it to end?  maybe its just me.  i love gideon.  eva is a great character.  if she wanted to let the story go on forever i would be perfectly happy!!

B00499NHLC|5.0|We highly recommend this series. You should watch from the beginning, as it builds on itself. Though the seasons are only 3 episodes long, each episode is 1 1/2 hrs. In length. It still leaves you wanting more...
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|My heart went out and broke as I read this book. It is an amazing story of resilience of the human spirit and shows such strength and courage.

0618526412|4.0|You have one (probably) gay deaf-mute with an interest in chess and a terrible taste in boyfriends, a black doctor with an overdeveloped sense of social responsibility and an underdeveloped sense of human relations, a pugnacious alcoholic who has read one Thorstein Veblen book too many, a 13-year-old girl with a passion for classical music and the gay deaf mute, and a cafe owner with no life other than sleeping, watching his customers from behind the checkout counter and pining for the 13-year-old girl. No wonder the heart is a lonely hunter.<br /><br />Carson McCullers' debut novel follows the five main characters as they seek connection and miss through their own innate flaws. The deaf-mute is in love with a louse who only uses him, the doctor and the alcoholic are so wrapped up in their ideas of how to save the world that they can't even connect with each other never mind anyone else, the cafe owner only realizes what he had in his marriage after it is gone and the girl...well, she has an excuse because early adolescence is a confusing time, especially for precocious youngsters.<br /><br />I liked this book for its evocation of a particular place and time (a mid-sized Southern town in the late 1930s), its neat dramatic structure where the deaf-mute serves as the hub of an informal social circle involving the rest of the characters and its detailed portraits of five interesting people. The overall tone of the book is a downer and you get the distinct impression that McCullers wasn't exactly a blast to be around. I would have liked to see at least one character who is well-adjusted and happy with life just to balance things but I'm guessing that McCullers didn't believe such people existed.<br /><br />Reading The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, I was reminded of another book published about a year earlier, The Day of the Locust, by Nathaniel West. Like Hunter, Locust follows a set of lonely, disaffected souls seeking to connect. His setting is Los Angeles and his characters, at least some of them, are more ambitious, even if delusionally so, than those in Hunter. But then, that's the difference between L.A. and sleepy Dixie. However, if you enjoyed The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, I suggest you try Day of the Locust too.<br /><br />Anyway, West and McCullers were pioneers of an approach to fiction that has now become a cliche: take a set of oddball characters, have them do unconventional/inexplicable things, assume that that is a profound statement about life and call it a day. West and McCullers are not responsible for this, of course, and their books rise far above the cliche with incisive character studies and rich, descriptive language.<br /><br />Sadly, following this very impressive debut, which she published when she was only 23, McCullers produced very little more. The three other works for which she is at least marginally known (Reflections in a Golden Eye, The Member of the Wedding and The Ballad of the Sad Cafe) collectively add up to about as many pages as Hunter by itself, indicating that she basically said just about all she had to say in her first work. But what that was is certainly worth reading.
B005LAII6C|2.0|Though I like the style of the movie, it is far too creepy and scary for children under the age of ten, my niece is six and sensitive and I warned her mother never to show her this movie.<br /><br />Spoiler alert<br />A town murdered a little girl because they thought she was a witch, and now she haunts the town and brings back her tormentors as zombies every year.  I know this is meant to be an anti bullying movie, but it goes too far and would give younger children nightmares.<br /><br />These filmmakers are known for going too far, they made coraline which had a gross partially, mostly nude fat lady.  Coraline I enjoyed more, but would still never show it to children.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Best book so far! I didn't want it to end. I can't wait for the next one in the series!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little thing is just the best.  And I stream a LOT of TV content.  I have PS3s (2), Rokus (3), Xbox (1), Google TV (1), and Boxee Box (1).  My favorite, however, is this little Chromecast unit.  It can't take over for all my streaming yet, as it doesn't have support for Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, or Vudu.  However, I'm positive these services will be providing support in very short time and this will become my go to device for TV and movie viewing.<br /><br />Using my phone or tablet as the remote for Netflix, YouTube or Google Play is so much better and superior than the custom built UIs built into the other devices.  It's not even close.  We've all have been having a great time using it to share YouTube Videos and watch Netflix.  Plan to buy 3 more to cover the rest of TVs in the house.  This thing is a no brainer.  Streaming from a Chrome web browser is a bit buggy and it works, but not as smooth as when built into the mobile apps.<br /><br />For $35, you can't go wrong.

It is a choice to Love , this is a book that explains the greatest human emotion quite well. The book was so uplifting in a pretty bad time for me, Love is an emotion that is complex and needs some definition this book helps in many ways. It defines and gives some structure that I can really work within. I liked it a lot and I am not a sappy type but I do care and understand more form taking the time to read this book.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|So, I was one of those folks who was hoping for the Riddler; I never gave much thought to Bane. When I saw this movie however, I'm glad that I gave it a shot. Granted I was not as familiar with Bane as I was with Riddler, I was amazed with what they did to the character. There is a plot here, which actually parallels real history. This is, in my opinion, even better than the Dark Knight and it's WAY better than the \\"Avengers\\". Christopher Nolan has proven with this trilogy and the \\"Man of Steel\\" movie, that he knows how to execute the storytelling, without berating you with special effects.

1439153663|4.0|I didn't think I would like this book when it was voted as the selection of the month by my book club, but I truly enjoyed this book. You get caught up in the characters and I found it difficult to put down.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object games. Hidden object levels are interspersed with puzzle mini games. very enjoyable.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Fortunately for me and without my knowing, this pair of headphones had everything I wanted and was devoid of the things I hated about headphones I previously owned. The build quality is impressive for $30 phones. I feel like I can use these indefinitely. It has a thick cord and solid connection between the cord and headphones so I don't have to worry about severing the connection whenever the cord gets snagged. I like the thicker pleather cushion covers on these, because on the last pair of phones I had (Sennheiser 202), the layer that covered the cushions disintegrated when I cleaned them gently with water. I like how the cord only connects to one side because it's less annoying than both sides. I also like how it's self-adjustable so you don't have to fiddle with that.<br />I can safely say these are the most clear sounding headphones I've listened to. The bass is big, but at the same time doesn't make everything muddy. You can hear the whole range of frequencies clearly. It has a fairly flat frequency response curve as it should. The only issue I've noticed, although minor, is that it has a slightly weak midrange and some sibilance. This can easily be remedied though with EQ. I find that by boosting 1K and 2K by ~1 dB and lowering 8K by ~2 dB that it sounds better, but even without the minor EQ it's still fine. It's only noticeable on certain songs. The worst thing was the packaging these came in. It was almost as if it was designed with the sole purpose of damaging the headphones. Some people might not like the semi-open design because it lets sound in and out, but this is a big plus for me because with the closed design I can hear myself breathing and it feels like my ears are underwater.<br />So yeah I really like these, but I only owned them for a couple of weeks so I will definitely update if I discover anything unfavorable.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|I had dreams of button eyes for weeks. This is one of my favorite movies. Fun. Scary. Spooky. Love it.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I thought the book started off pretty well, but then it became highly predictable.  I was also very disappointed in how sexualized it was for the main character to only be turning sixteen. If I had a teenage daughter I would not want her to read this. I am a 29 yr old female
0689877692|5.0|this book is so beautiful, my daughter loves to look for the little dots, over and over again. It's a great piece of art. thanks!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game and easy to play. Graphics are of excellent quality. The horses look realistic. I like taking photos of my horse and feeding her treats. I like to learn the tricks. The competitions are exciting.  I cannot wait to play more.
B0094M2ODQ|4.0|An interesting gender switch in terms of the question of sex vs. love.  Well acted- Bridges and Streisand were excellent.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Action packed just like all the Die Hard movies!  John is awesome and his son is a chip off the ol' block!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Well written, held my interest and characters seemed real.  Ending was rather sad but fit the story.  I could see in my mind the locale, etc.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Good movie.  We enjoyed watching the movie with all the family.  The story line was great and the characters were wonderful.  Quite entertaining.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I didn't think it could be any better that the others that I have read, but I was wrong.  I thoroughly enjoy Jo Nesbo's writing and Harry Hole's character.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i played this in my classroom because it was so popular this app is very awesome i play it for 6 hours
B003G4W49C|5.0|This joint Hugo-Nebula winner did not disappoint. This should be required on every Sci-Fi reading list. Pick it up and give it a quick read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a spectacular ride through a little-known piece of American history, that we all should be exposed to.  Miss Kline  has taken these historical facts and woven a rich tapestry through the trials and tribulations of her main character--an orphan on the journey of so many.  From her past to her present, she astutely continues to weave the story of Vi' s life, now an elderly woman, with an older tens, Molly, a girl with her own tragic past.  As theirs lives connect, magical things occur.  The story becomes a full circle, filled with the healing power of acceptance, respect and unconditional love. A wonderful journey and a great read for teens and adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure what all the hype was about regarding Hunger Games... I watched the movie and thought it was awful and confusing. Then a friend explained the main points and I decided it was worth a read. And now I'm hooked. Phenomenally written and it keeps you wanting more! I finished this series in about 4 days and it soul  have taken less if I didn't have motherly duties to attend to. A must read!
1476733953|5.0|There are a lot of words that can be used to describe the effect that this book has had on my imagination. The sign of a great author, in my opinion, is that the writing conveys far more than just the words written down on paper. The best word to describe the book in my beliefs is inspirational.<br /><br />This is a book that has a lot of twists, and many turns, going both up and down, and it has a very detailed and exquisite soul. If I could give a book a personality I would call this book a dark flame that grows colder and warmer at the same time. It is laden with some of the most interesting kinds of conflict I've ever had the privilege of reading in this genre, and that is the best recommendation I can give it.<br /><br />The writing is a thrill to read and it was well worth the wait. This is the very first book that I have purchased from this site, and it is a purchase I will never regret. The world just feels like it is ripe with such possibility, and there is just so much at work in the political and cultural ramifications throughout the book that I didn't want to put it down for an instant. An excellent read!
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|It's much like the first album, bright and danceable. Definitely something I would play at a dance party with my friends.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is wonderful had it on my ipod so glad it finally came to kindle...great fun for everyone and many hours of fun. thank you
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|This is one of my favorites. It's exciting, and it definitely is better than the two previous albums, and I can only describe it as a 'love life' CD.
B005LAII4E|5.0|everything I expected out of the rock and bruce willis effects were very good Can't wait for the next installment
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|I enjoyed the music, it was very upbeat and danceable. I very much enjoy listening to it and learning the words.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|If you're the type of person who has to have everything spoon-fed to you to make sense and can't pick out underlying meaning in movies or literature then this movie is not for you. Yeah, this movie requires you to pay attention but rewards you as it goes along & has one of the most touching payoffs in recent memory. It's a visually mesmerizing film with an amazingly emotional score that deals with humanity, karma, reincarnation, true love, & choices we make as humans & how they can affect entire lives & generations. This is the type of movie that Hollywood should get pats on the back for making, it's daring and insightful and will obviously polarize many who don't \\"get it\\".
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|As someone who very recently became obsessed with Thirty Seconds to Mars, this was the absolute first album I had to buy. For someone who knows some songs from the band but wants to expand their music collection, this is a must have. With easily recognizable The Kill, From Yesterday, and A Beautiful Lie; the cd is a 'safe' buy in my opinion-- meaning that I already knew what a few of the songs sound like, so the rest of the album won't be a complete shock or a disappointment. And this album is no disappointment. The songs I didn't previously know are my favorites, like Attack, Savior,The Story, and The Battle of One. Overall, a stunning album that is constantly on repeat!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Jenna represents the awkward teen that we all either were or still are. Maybe we aren't as verbose or witty as she is, but very one can relate. Super funny!! Just wish the episodes were longer...
B009NQZVKG|4.0|As always, a fun and exciting read weaving science, history, religion and disparate cultures into a cohesive and engaging story.
0552774405|5.0|I am not the biggest reader, but I could not put this book down!<br /><br />It will definitely make you laugh out loud. It's very light hearted and very fun. I have recommended this book to everyone I know and anyone reading these reviews thinking about buying it... Just do it! I promise it is a decision you will not regret!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I tried several times, but I couldn't keep the movie going long enough to pick up any story or even dialogue. I had a limited time to watch this, so I had to give up on it. I'm generally satisfied with Amazon's services, but this one didn't work.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Sometimes we forget the values in life that are important.......this movie reminds me of the value of time & that life isn't always as bad as we see it!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works great.  Shipping was fast and item was as described.  Works for both my iphone 5 and nexus 7 (2nd gen) tablet.  Love that it only uses one 12v port but I can charge 2 devices.  Thanks.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This Blu-ray 3D is amazing and never loses its thrill or charm.  I would highly recommend this movie for any collector.
B00B9366VO|5.0|A brilliant directorial debut from Dave Grohl, this movie does more for explaining what it means to love music than any other film I've seen. While the various musicians interviewed share the experience of having recorded in this one place (Sound City) on this one piece of equipment (the Neve soundboard), what Grohl really does here is bring together a diverse group of musicians spanning various rock genres over 4 decades of recording and get them all to talk about how the creation of music is best when it's a shared human experience. If you love music, you'll love this film. If you're indifferent to music, then you'll at least understand what it is that those music lovers get out of creating and listening to music.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is a captivating historical fiction novel, one of the best books I've read. I could not put this book down.
B00005ATZT|5.0|My husband loves this movie and has watched it over and over since I got it for him.  It is a really great<br />movie and you never seem to get bored watching it over and over.
B005COO1X6|5.0|someday or some kind of resolution or explanation  beyond what was in the story but the idea of a derelict classic car as a portal to another dimension is cool and a twist on the Christine story. Are they related?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|MUCH FUN!!  I really love this game.  I downloaded it on my kindle for myself and my daughter and we just keep playing it.  AWESOME!
B000FC0P9E|5.0|The tale reminds me of King's many stories where kids have to rely upon themselves and their own wits to survive. None of them are identical except in that the children are usually wise beyond their years and much smarter and intuitive than adults think children should be
B004SVM7BW|3.0|The typical pdf I need to work with is at least 15mb and usually 50mb or 100mb in size.  These are usually magazines or art instruction books, so they are in color and have a lot of images to render. That said, I have had trouble finding a pdf app that shows pages quickly & without any issues.  EzPDF was my first try and it can slow way down each time you turn a page, but it would render the page correctly and provided other useful services.  Frustrated with the slowness, I then tried an app called EBookDroid which renders these pages superfast, but otherwise isn't a very polished app.  I've also recently tried PDFMax, but haven't used it enough to comment yet.  So I was eager to see this on offer as FAOTD today but was initially turned off when I read about the internet requirement for the app to even function (mentioned in several reviews & a deal breaker for my uses).  When I had more time, I checked back on the reviews later in the day and low and behold, this internet requirement didn't seem to apply to everyone who tried the app so I finally decided to see for myself.<br /><br />Now for it's usefulness with my pdf needs.  The short answer is not very good.  Pages are either the same or way slower to render than with EzPDF, and the preview panel only shows about 10 little complete pages, the rest being blank white.  When I scroll down to the next page, it seems to be ready for display and there is no time delay. However, the real problem occurs when I try to jump ahead using the preview panel (this is something I do regularly with a document).  When I click on one of preview images, it will jump quickly to that page only if it's not blank (remember only about the next 8-10 are like this). If it's one of the blank white pages, it takes a good 60-90 seconds to display that full page.  EzPDF sometimes takes 8-10 seconds to display a page when I jump way ahead like this, but the preview panel is always fully rendered so I know where exactly I going and I've never had over a minute to wait for a page to load in this circumstance.  I'm sure for plain text PDFs, this app probably works just fine, but for my needs... not so much.  I will keep this around to see if the app gets better at handling my needs in the future.  Like I mentioned above, no pdf app is perfect at what I want.... so I keep looking.<br /><br />I had no trouble operating app without internet access (Asus Transformer 300TF). The only time it needed to be online was when I went to try out it's cloud access... tried Google Drive & nothing would happen. Then connected to internet and it now had access to Google Drive through my account. That is also the likely explanation for needing access to accounts. More and more document & ebook type apps are adding that permission so that users can access their Google Drive acct. from within the app. In fact, my ebook reader Moon+ Reader Pro recently added that permission just for that specific service. I guess it's a trade off. Some will be annoyed at account access, but others really want that functionality.<br /><br />One last thing that some Kindle device users might want to know.... I understand from a Kindle programmer friend of mine that the embedded google accounts on all other android devices (there is a mandatory google acct sign in when device is brand new) have no functionality on any Kindle Fire devices. Amazon specifically removed that from their version of android. That is why Kindle users find there is no Google Drive access in many of the apps that advertise that service--because the apps have no background google acct to access inside the device. Amazon did this for the obvious reasons of wanting users to purchase & use all of their content thru Amazon & not their competitor Google. So when an app lists the permission \\"Access the list of accounts in the Accounts Service\\" it's referring to all those other non-Kindle android devices and is therefore as meaningless as the \\"read phone number\\" permission to a Kindle user.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents,<br />Jen
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|I have been a Cher fan for the last four and a half decades. When she had her variety show with Sonny. I am a true die hard fan!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is an ok game, real similar to the original card game.  To make better  the  ...games should have player chat ability and I think it cost to much to players for the winning prize.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect size calculator with large buttons that does all the mathematical calculations I need.  I will probably use this more than any calculator I own.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|Not only a great movie for kids but adults also.  Characters have witty personalities. Can't wait to see Despicable Me 2.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun game. Better if it was free will probably delete. Farkle is free to play should charge for game and then play should be free.
B001U7FW1O|5.0|Their keyboards and winding guitars keep the pace moving and it's ahead of it's time. Very original stuff from the 80's that didn't get the acclaim that it should have. Very happy to find this and spin it again.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I feel like the movie could have been done in a different, less vulgar manor. We didn't even finish it :(
1612680011|5.0|This book...........!!!!!!!!!!!! This book is utterly simplistic & a 3rd grader could fully grasps its contents. In its simplicity it draws out aspects that I had never thought of.<br /><br />For example, from 'K through 12' I never had a single lesson on finances & the value of money &, or wealth. We s..pend years in school to never learn about what revolves around life (buying food, clothes, cars, houses, assets....etc).<br /><br />I am buying this my kids and friends. &#34;Buy assets first then liabilities&#34; (Robert Kiyosaki).
B0015AARJI|5.0|Product was well packed, shipped fast and was in excellent condition. I bought it to use with my jb ipad 4 and my pc as an extra controller and it has worked perfectly for both so far (although it can only be paired to one at a time).
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I absolutely love this new Tron!!!!! I love how the incorporate the original with almost 30 yr difference. The shots, effects and dress are outstanding. The acting is PERFECT!!!! Jeff Bridges is an amazing actor!<br /><br />I also, love the little bits of thought provoking philosophy that is occasionally inserted!!!!
B00DURILJ2|2.0|After reading many good reviews, I shelled out for a trip to an actual theater. What a disappointment. It's a story about kids, not \\"Mud.\\" But as kid stories go, this is a pretty lame one.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I have watched this movie more than 3 times! This true story provokes interest and thought. Wow!!!! What they went through!!!<br /><br />Not only that...but the acting is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the type of movie where you forget that the actors are playing a role and you are lost in the plot and dialogue.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded and it would not open gets stuck on quick tips screen. Could not play the game.  please fix soon.
B006T3RM08|2.0|Pro: Everything is conveniently .n one place<br /><br />Con:<br />The section dedicated for the trackpad is entirely to tight &#34;snug&#34;. My trackpad is constantly sticking, I have to remove the trackpad and place it back in order to get the infamous &#34;clique&#34; feature that is rarely obtainable, while using this product.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great fun and quick paced, both in gameplay and advancement. It's fun to be despicable and knock minions flying. And really annoying to review with minimum character counts on this. Seriously I've said my piece, who really cares what people write in these any ways? I mean really is a full whatever number of characters really needed to say &amp;#34;I enjoy the game, it's a fun game to play&amp;#34;. Its a time waster, a diversion from work, school, or what other tedious form of reality consumes your day. What else is there to say really?
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have used TripAdvisor for years. The only way to travel and get realistic and honest opinions about hotels, restaurants, etc.... Wouldn't think of going on an overnight trip or spending money in certain places without checking out the reviews first.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great read surprised by the difference from movie. The differences held you in suspense. Always enjoy Nicholas Sparks novels, they all tell a different story.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|I really like the premise of the show and the development of the characters. But sometimes I get tired of another tv show about show business where EVERYONE has to be sleeping with someone....
B00EAZTONU|5.0|The packaging is great, the slipcase is thick and sturdy and the back features an embossed acorn emblem of Bilbo's waist coat buttons. The case that the Blu-Ray discs are in is black, just like the Lord Of The Rings Extended Edition Blu-Ray set.

B00B2DSK06|5.0|Watched this with the entire family and we all loved it. It had a great story line and character development.
B004K58GSO|5.0|The just don't make them like this anymore! John Wayne and Robert Mitchum who could ask for a better all star cast!
B00DW39B2K|2.0|This movie was very silly to my husband and I. We just had a hard time with all the horrible accents, acting, and over all story line. I was hoping it would get better as the movie went along but it just kept getting worst. It was like these guys were just to lazy to really put effort in to making it a great movie. Too bad we can't get a refund :(
B005FISBTO|5.0|One of the best shows on DVD. It's too bad this show is coming to an end. I received this in the mail much quicker than I thought I would.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|6 yr old and 10 yr old really enjoy it. Worth the cost of nothing so download to entertain children when needed
B00B2166BS|5.0|It came fast, and charges well.  I love the magnetic connect so it won't damage any ports if it's accidentally yanked out.  I love that I never have to worry about my mini-USB port falling apart.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I'm a big Harry Hole fan, but Nesbo's debut Hole novel seems unfocused and labored. I was disappointed, but his fans will be interested in this piece of the character's history.
B000I9VON0|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  It's now incredibly dated because it involves so much &#34;technology,&#34; but the comedy, characters, and writing are tops.  Plus, you can quote the voice imprint thingee like a boss.
B0014JKJK2|5.0|I got a job in a restaurant as a cook and my sneakers weren't cutting it.<br /><br />Most chefs/cooks I know swear by their Croc's, so I snagged a pair.<br /><br />I have very wide feet (probably a 10.5 long, but usually buy 12's in most brands of skateshoes Vans, DC, etc) so I bought these in a 12 as they have no 'wide' size offerings.<br /><br />For the first week or so, my feet fit pretty loose and slid around in these (part of that is because they are all plastic/rubber which is slippery fresh from the molds). But after that first week, they molded nicely to my feet and I've never had a problem since.<br /><br />One pair has lasted me 6+ months of 40+ hour work weeks with no signs of needing replaced. When the they start to lose their non-skid-ness on floors (from all the crud in the tread), I just run them through our dishwasher at work, dry the insides, and they are like brand new (and oddly soothingly warm, mmmmmmm lol).<br /><br />In the same time I've had mine, 2 of our other cooks have bought and replaced their knock-off brand versions of these (they were from Walmart and the soles detached, and were only $10 cheaper). I've also talked several of our servers into getting the ballet-style ladys Crocs because they kept wiping out on spills in the kitchen.
B002M7A79S|2.0|The movie itself was fine, but the HD playback was seriously lacking. Usually don't have a problem, but I thought I was watching an 80's movie for a while.
B00BS6WRPG|2.0|Artists go through cycles. Not sure what this is. Seems to be trying to go more mainstream with lackluster results. Hopefully he will swing back around! Cant recommend this one!<br />Stick with Twenty something and earlier efforts! He's an incredible talent that seems out of his element on this one!
B002K99P7S|5.0|Good story line.  Good acting.  Fills in background story.  Way more intereting than the other XMen movies.  I like the focus on just one mutant.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Good formatting info regarding Kindle. A quick and easy read if you are doing the uploading yourself. I recommend this book.
B008J34466|4.0|TRANSACTION WENT WELL. CD IS AS EXPECTED. I WOULD DO BUSINESS HERE AGAIN. NOT REALLY A PINK FAN BUT, TRYING TO BROADEN MY HORIZONS.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|When I first found this so called trilogy it was said the set was similar to 50 shades.  I read 50 shades and fell in love with it. It was a couple that found each other and she was innocent but went his way and he fell in love and went her way.  There is no comparison to that crap I just got through reading. Shame on the author for putting so much negative stuff in a love story. It ended with her going away and her boyfriend that has a song for her and it is a hit will be in the next book you can count on it and I am sure they will spend the time together and than she will say, oh Gideon I was drunk. Too much sex in the book and not enough about them to see why they came together in the first place. Yes he killed someone for her but she was jealous over all the girls in his life but it was ok to lust and kiss Brett. I barrowed this set and I am so glad I didn't pay for it.  All I can say is I hope the author does not mess the next book up with her sleeping with her ex and her husband trusting her.  It has to much pain in her books and she is a slut.  Gideon needs someone he can trust. I bet they wont be making a movie over this stuff.  Horrible
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|YOU CAN'T GO WRONG HERE. MY FAV BRUNO CD. HE IS AN AMAZING TALENT. HOPE HE IS AROUND SINGING FOR YEARS.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book when read for historical value (and I have always been a lover and avid reader/studier of history) is so informative of the period and times, just as the title indicates.  It does NOT influence a person who chooses to believe that Jesus was the Christ/Messiah, but puts all in context.  I was already pretty familiar with a lot of the history contained within, but every page seems to increase my knowledge of that time and the people.  A great read.
B005EVVESM|4.0|THIS IS THE FIRST MAROON 5 I HAVE PURCHASED. I ENJOY THE VARIETY. REALLY APPRECIATE ADAM. HE GIVES IT HIS ALL.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|It really works well. Don't know why the last reviewer whines. Just send it back and get a new one. It can happen with all electronics to get a lemon. One of the best trackers. Looks and feels great, seems accurate according to many testers. Fits in the withings system well.

0316010669|3.0|the book was ehhh i probably would've liked it more if it didnt feel like a wet book that was dried out and also if it didn't have light coffee stains on the edges.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|My grandson didn't realize that it was $9.99 a month. He can order $5.00 a month. He called me to say he was sorry that he pushed the wrong button. I told him it was okay because I have accidently ordered books before. I am sure it is a wonderful game. I cancelled it..$9.99 a month is too much. Thank you.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|very entertaining even for adults! a little difficult for smaller children! download now and get to playing. good graphics and game play.
B005LAII4E|3.0|I really didn't know if I would like this movie because I am not a big fan of Channing Tatum! Call me crazy but that boy can't act! I might be the only passenger on this crazy train that believes this man couldn't act his way out of a paper bag but that's just how I feel. The movie started out with a lot of bad acting (CT) and miss casting. On what planet would Channing Tatum be cast to out rank the Rock! WTF! I almost stop watching it for that part alone but I hung in there. Good thing I did because CT's character was killed and then all the real actin heroes showed up and showed out! That was CT's best acting to date, knowing when to bow out and let the real actors do their jobs! Bravo for that CT! This wasn't the best action movie I've seen but certainly not the worst once they dropped CT. This was a good movie! I recommend you fast forward to the part after Channing Tatum's character dies and then you will enjoy the movie.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is just the sweetest show. The characters are like friends and you can't wait to spend time with them. I would definitely recommend to any one who is looking for a sweet, funny and endearing little series!
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|this game totally changed 1 of my missions is to dodge like over 1 million missiles in one game. which is incredibly hard. I also almost bought something for 20 dollars on the game I think I might delete it even though just playing the game is fun for everyone.
B00821PCJS|3.0|I really like this show, but was disappointed that there weeny more episodes for the year!  Can't wait to purchase season 2.
0786962984|5.0|I bought this game to play with my 14-year old son and his 8-year old sister jumped in and became quite a good player! The goal of the game follows traditional \\"dungeon crawler\\" gameplay where you explore the rooms of an underground dungeon to encounter monsters, fight them, gain experience and loot treasure. In this Dungeon game, player characters do not gain experience and level up since the game plays too quickly for that.<br /><br />(A \\"house rule\\" that we've adopted is to actually roll basic character sheets and give them 1 XP per monster level that they kill, and give minor bonuses as they level up. This is purely for fun and does not affect the gameplay of the board game.)<br /><br />The first player to reach their gold goal and make it back to the start wins. Typical game with 3-4 players lasts 45 minutes, but up to 8 can play. It would be extremely hard to win with 8 since the rooms would get cleared so quickly but I have yet to try it with that many players.<br /><br />There are 4 character classes--Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard. Each class has unique abilities and combat rolls. Most notable among the four is the Wizard class, which can attack at range and remain undamaged. This unfair advantage is balanced by the fact that Wizards run out of spells and have to return to the starting space to recharge their spell book (which will take at least 7 turns). So, a Wizard who rolls extremely good rolls can clean out Level 6 rooms quickly for the win, while poor rolls will effectively put the Wizard out of play for up to a dozen turns while they recharge. It's a pretty good balance. And due to the Wizard's firepower, they have a much higher gold threshold to win (30,000) which further balances this powerful class. Other players will want to clear low-level rooms quickly to earn their 10,000G first.<br /><br />The Dungeon board appears at first glance to be one large level full of rooms and larger chambers, but it is supposed to represent 6 levels of depth with each level progressively more difficult (but with greater treasure). There are hidden doors in many of the passages that require a turn (or more) to open, which helps slow down the gameplay.<br /><br />Combat involves rolling two D6 dice against a monster's threshold defense value. The lower level monsters are an easy kill with a defense of 2-4, while level 6 monsters tend toward the 10-12 range (so, realistically, only a Wizard has a chance of defeating a Worm or Dragon at range without getting killed--and thus, each character class has a recommended range of levels, beyond which they are ineffective).<br /><br />Bonuses are limited to just a magic sword which will add +1 or +2 to the player's roll (Fighter, Cleric, and Rogue only). I would have liked to see more bonus cards in the deck. This game really appeals to the player who enjoys playing with house rules. Indeed, this game seems to encourage house rules to customize the gameplay. It is purposely simplistic and as such, the rule book is only 8 pages with illustrations. I imagine a lot of fans will create their own enhanced cards. Which seems to be an opportunity for Wizards of the Coast! Official expansion card decks would be a welcome addition to this product.<br /><br />Now I can't sing it's praises without at least pointing out some of the flaws. Although the gameplay is almost perfect out of the box there is room for improvement. First, my biggest complaint is the playing cards which are only 1/2 size. I don't like half-sized cards in any game (for instance, Cave Troll, for the same reason). I can't imagine that using full size cards would have added much to the production costs. The small cards limit this game quite a bit, however, it may be that WotC decided to use them because the table can get crowded with 2 stacks per level (12 card stacks--monsters and treasure cards for each level).<br /><br />Another house variant we have considered doing is mixing the monster cards from all levels, and similarly for treasure cards. This would render the game board into a single large flat level with truly random encounters in the rooms, which could add to the anxiety. Frankly, when you know what's going to be in a level 1 room, there's little fear of danger. But what if there's a L6 dragon inside?ly for treasure cards. This would render the game board into a single large flat level with truly random encounters in the rooms, which could add to the anxiety. Frankly, when you know what's going to be in a level 1 room, there's little fear of danger. But what if there's a L6 dragon inside?

B00CTT9646|5.0|I liked this movie more than the first movie (of this timeline).<br />An't we just go out a movie and enjoy it for what it is...a piece of entertainment? Something that is going to take you out of your everyday stress, problems or ho-hum for a while.<br />I like to consider myself a core fan. I was a little girl watching the original series when it first aired on TV. I remember screaming and jumping on my father when the \\"alligator man was going to eat the cap'n\\" or words to that effect, I was only 7 at the time.<br />Even though I am a core fan I think all of this nonsense some of your display over a work of fiction is ridiculous. I hear the same nit picking about The Lord of the Rings series and The Hobbit.<br />Core fans are hungry to see their beloved franchise revived but absolutely do not want their beloved sci-fi universe destroyed. I think the alternate timeline Orci and Kurtzman came up with works for that reason. We have all of our characters, we have similar stories but due to changes, from Pike dying to Vulcan getting blown up to Romulus getting obliterated, all of these things gives the writers new directions to go (Although getting rid of Romulus in the very first movie seems a bit premature).<br />Life is just too short to get yourselves all fired up over a movie. This isn't \\"Grand Illusion\\"[[ASIN:0780020707 Grand Illusion (The Criterion Collection)]], for Pete's sake, it's a sci-fi movie and a darn good one too.<br />Did anyone catch the Mudd reference? The spaceship they took onto the Klingon planet they confiscated during the \\"Mudd Incident\\". I wonder if it was the one hauling women around for lonely miners or his having a planet filled with Commander Data like beings.<br />In any case, I loved the many surprise references to the old series, \\"Nurse Chapel\\" reference, calling Scotty a \\"Miracle Worker\\", Dr Marcus, the \\"needs of the many\\" line and of course, KHHHHHAAAAAAANNNNNN!<br /><br />Just FYI, one of the funniest moments in the movie for me waswhen Uhura and Spock was fighting and they were on the Mudd vessel. Kirk asks them both, \\"Is working together going to be a problem for you two?\\" and Uhura quickly says, \\"Nope, no problem\\" and Spock gives this weird look and says, \\"Uncertain\\".<br /><br />BTW Benedict Cumberbatch scares me...more than W. Morgan Sheppard and he seemed to make it into many of the movies/episodes of the Star Trek Franchise.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|The stories are compelling, with great acting. Although one probably can't identify with Alicia's lifestyle, most women will recognize and relate to every expression on her face. Her conflicts are real and she reacts to them realistically, honestly and without idealism. None of the characters are in easily resolved situations.<br />Well written, acted, honest, and engrossing.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|My granddaughter and I have had so much fun playing this together.  She is six and this is something that not only challenging for her, but challenging for grandma as well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game.  It's not terribly challenging but it's a fun way to fill up few minutes of free time.  Because you have to wait for energy to rebuild, it's not a game you can play for hours on end but for me that's part of the appeal as it keeps me from wasting too much time on it.  The only thing I don't like is that as your level goes up, more is required to explore a room.  I wish I could have access to the rooms without having to spend diamonds.  Other than that, I think it's a great game.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I rented this movie on the recommendation of a friend and it was absolutely great. Full of witty humor and some poignant moments, the cast works together to make a memorable, feel-good movie. Definitely adding this to my re-watch list, and would recommend it!

B00D3V8PSC|3.0|A few tracks make this album worthwhile, the vast majority don't however. I had heard reviews that said that this was in the same neighbourhood of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, which leads me to believe that the person that wrote that had never heard SBS...I was really looking forward to this after so much time away, and maybe my expectations were too high...Ozzy has said they're going to do another one album after this tour...I can only hope that Tony Iommi's health continues to improve so that they can try again...because this one doesn't live up to their standard imho...

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not up to the standard of The Kite Runner. Hosseini is a good storyteller but the narrative tended to get somewhat overwhelmed by too many subsidiary characters.

An amazing product and at $35.00 it is a steal .
B0049VZ222|5.0|If you haven't watched the Walking Dead yet you need to read this review.<br />Your probably saying to yourself, &#34;I don't like that type of program&#34; or &#34;It's not for me, I don't like horror or zombies&#34;<br />This is where this show differs. The main story is about a zombie apocalypse, but that is where it starts, it goes way beyond that to a basic survival story. Without getting into the story too much it traces the story of an ordinary man (a sheriff) who's life is thrown into chaos when he is shot on duty and goes into a coma. when he wakes after the apocalypse he is searching for his family (wife and son) and what he discovers is horrifying.<br />I started watching this show from episode 1 and that's how you need to see it. The first five minutes will hook you.<br />After that you will be a fan for life.When the show first aired in 2010 I watched it and told my sister about it. She said &#34;I'm not interested in that&#34; and I told her if she watched the first episode she would be hooked. Fast forward to one year later and the second season was about to start so AMC was having a marathon of the first season. I told my sister to DVR it and watch it when she had time. She did that, and when she did she started watching the show on a Friday night, she couldn't stop watching until 2:00 in the morning, she was hooked. This is a person who never liked horror movies, zombie movies etc.<br />While this little story might not get everyone interested in the show, I hope I get at least a few people to watch, once you do..................................you'll  be  hooked!!!!!!!!!<br />I hope I have been helpful.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|This novel wasn't at all what I expected. I think I was expecting a happily ever after romance. What I got was a book that really made me think. The premise of the book and the main characters situations and reactions made me spend some time inside my own thoughts. For that reason, the pacing of the book was rocky for me, I kept picking it up and putting it down. I spent a lot of time wishing for someone to talk it over with, which leads me to believe this novel would be a good choice for book clubs. The premise of the story was intriguing, the main characters drew me in, the secondary characters helped lighten the mood at times. The changes in point of view were abrupt at times, perhaps again made more difficult because of my need to step away from the book at times.<br />To sum it up; if you are looking for a light romance, this is not for you. If you like a book that makes you ponder (like Jodi Picoult)choose Me Before You.<br />*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.

B004A7OQKY|4.0|This is the perfect workout for expectant mothers.  Erin  does a great job in keeping things moving so you don't get board.  She also gives modifications throughout the workout, if you should need it.  I  think it is just the right amount of  exercise for all stages of pregnancy. I  was  skeptical about buying my first prenatal video. I  was  very active before getting pregnant and wanted something that  would challenge me. There  are so many  choices and  in the end I  went with Erin.  Probably the  best decision I  could have made.  She combines  cardio  with  Pilates for a full body workout. I  love this workout  and  can't wait to use it throughout the rest of my pregnancy.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King has taken the art of subtle creepiness to a level all his own!  This book is a perfect example of why you should read the book first. The characters are rich and so much more relatable than the movie. Also, the ending is completely satisfying.

B00D3LA71K|4.0|\\"I got a lot of folks looking for me. I shot a man.\\" Two young boys grab a boat and go to an island looking for a new place to play they are surprised to see a man working out there. Mud (McConaughey) and the kids become instant friends and he begins to ask them for favors. What starts off as two boys trying to get a boat evolves into a true friendship between all three. I have to admit that I am a McComaughey fan, I think he is a very good actor and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves, mainly due to his rom-com movie choices, but I have a feeling that this will change all that. He seems very comfortable in this role and it really suits him. The movie has a little Slingblade quality to it and I think that helps the movie. This is the kind of movie where you aren't really sure who is honest and it keeps you guessing the whole time waiting for someone's true colors to show and see if your intuition is right. This is a lesser know movie but I think is one of the first Oscar contenders of the year not only for McConaughey, but also for the kid who plays Ellis and a dark horse best picture candidate. This is a very good movie and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that should finally give McConaughey the recognition he deserves. I give it a B+.

1416955070|4.0|In case you have been living under a rock and didn't know it yet, the first book in the Mortal Instruments series, City of Bones, is a new film expected to be released in August.  Knowing this information for about a year, I decided, as I often do, that I needed to read the book first before I saw the movie.  So I received this book for Christmas from a fellow book blogger and finally read it last month.  Phew!  There are five books in the series, which is a huge commitment I believe I am planning to make.  Oh boy!<br /><br />Clary and her best friend Simon go clubbing one night at a place called Pandemonium and Clary witnesses a murder.  Not just any ordinary murder, but one involving vampires and tattooed shadow hunters and she wonders why she can see them and Simon cannot. When she gets home late at night, shaken to her core, her mom plans to ground her for the rest of her life.  Except Clary and her mom get into a big fight and the next thing you know her mom calls her on her cell phone, sounding panicked and breathless, and makes Clary promise never to come home.  Clary's mom doesn't answer her phone when she calls her back and she fears something horrible has happened to her.<br /><br />So of course Clary goes home by herself to try and locate her mom.  Her apartment is in disarray and a huge demonic bug looking creature tries to eat her for dinner.  Basically she kills the monster size bug demon by herself.  Girl Power!  But the demon has injected her with his venom and now she is getting very sleepy.  Luckily she ran into Jace, the shadow hunter she met the night before, and he rescues her before she perishes and whisks her away to \\"the Institute\\".  This all happens in the first four chapters!!<br /><br />City of Bones is an action packed adventure and a page turning fast read.  It is melodramatic, and fantastical and just plain fun to read.  Cassandra Clare is a writer who knows who to keep the reader turning the pages and guessing as to what is really going on.  There was a few times I exclaimed, WHAT?!  She didn't!, etc.  I tried to predict what was going to happen and was unable to.  To me, that is one sign of a good writer.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare has created a unique fantasy world within our own, a sort of shadow world that only some people can see. Everyone else, basic human types, are called Mundanes.  The main character, Clary, straddles both of these worlds.  What is cool about this shadow world is it contains multiple types of fantastical beings in it like werewolves, vampires, fairies, demons, including a whole new set of creatures you will want to learn more about like shadow hunters.  Very creative fantasy world.<br /><br />I have to say I really enjoyed this book, and will probably continue reading the series.  I predict the world to go, goo goo, ga ga, over these new movies being produced.g on.  There was a few times I exclaimed, WHAT?!

B005721Y7Y|5.0|The film \\"American Beauty\\" is great and a true example of the Black Comedy.  Kevin Spacey is awesome in the lead role and Annette Bening is his equal.  This movie rates as among the best work that either of them has ever done.  Kevin Spacey's character is a man who is disenchanted with every aspect of his life including his marriage and his job.  He is middle aged and decides to<br />leave his job in advertising and takes a job in a fast food joint.  He also developes a serious crush on one of the girlfriends of his teenage daughter and really embarrasses his daughter by recklessly pursuing this girl.  She attempts to be worldly but it turns out that she is a virgin who pretends to have sexual experience.  In addition, the girl teases her friend about seducing the young lady's father. Meanwhile,  his daughter falls for the boy next door who is her age and is a voyeur who takes pictures of Spacey's daughter from his bedroom window.  When she realizes that she is being photographed, she decides to partially disrobe to excite the neighbor.  The young man also reintroduces the Spacey character to drugs.  Mostly marijuana.  The father of this boy is constantly spying on his son who in the past has done drugs.  The father makes the boy give a urine sample and also locks certain parts of the house to indicate that they are off limits to the boy.<br /><br />The Kevin Spacey character also begins a serious exercise regimen in order to assist him in enticing his daughter's friend.  One aspect of the exercise regimine is that Spacey begins to work out with some men who are openly gay and this allows the boy's father to speculate that Spacey's character is gay as well.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, the daughter and wife are seriously unhappy with him and the wife embarks on an affair with a fellow real estate salesman who is much more successful in the industry than she is.  The two adulterers are caught when they drive up to the fast food restaurant where Kevin Spacey character works.<br /><br />The film ends in a tragic way when the teenage boy's father believes that his son is in a homosexual relationship with Kevin Spacey.  The father beats the boy and orders him out of the home and the two teenagers plan to runaway to NYC together.  Kevin Spacey's character attempts to have sex with the friend of his daughter but upon finding out that she has no previous sexual experience, he loses his desire for her.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's character is murdered.  He is shot in the back of the head but it is not exactly clear who shot him.  It could be his wife or the father of the boy next door.<br /><br />I think that this film is magnificent and has a great cast, good direction, pace and some very comedic moments.  I would suggest that people will be watching this movie years from now.
B000UX6THK|1.0|Luckily, I've seen this show before, so I know it's a great show. If I hadn't already seen this show, I would not be able to tell if it's good or not based on this DVD set. Some of the discs were badly scratched even though it was new. Discs 1 - 5 were fine, but when I got to disc 6, there were some minor scratches, but I was willing to let that slide. I got to disc 7 and that disc has a really deep scratch around the edge and it does not work at all. This is really disappointing because this DVD set is not cheap and I really enjoy Twin Peaks and was looking forward to owning it on DVD and being able to watch it whenever I want.<br /><br />Also, by the time I got discs 6 and 7, it was too late to return it for a refund or exchange.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this until the manufacturer realizes that they are selling a defective product and makes the necessary changes to the quality of the packaging and the discs. If they actually do this (which I doubt they will), I will definitely buy that DVD set. Twin Peaks is that good of a show. It deserves better than this.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun and entertaining game!!! Need more lives given in shorter period of time!!! Enjoy playing this game and so does my daughter!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is by far one of the best games i have ever played on my tablet. its multiplayer, fun, and different from most tablet games. i give it a 10 out of 10
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I actually completed in just a couple hours... DEFINITELY need more levels! Once I figured out the combo for the safe on the first level, I was on a roll! Lol! Couldn't stop, til it was done... Great game! Loads of fun! Definitely recommend if you enjoy the &quot;figure it out&quot; type games! Look forward to more levels, MobiGrow!! HURRY!! Lol!!
B000OLRH10|5.0|THIS WAS A FABULOUS MOVIE BUT ALSO VERY DISTURBING, INFORMATIVE AS WELL. I HAD A HARD TIME WATCHING IT BUT GLAD I DID.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and easy-to-use! : )<br />I couldn't possibly find a better horse game. If I had anything bad to say<br />about this game it would be a lie.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This movie was just epic!  After watching that crappy Batman movie by Chris Nolan in the summer of 2012, it's refreshing to see that Bruce Timm still knows how to make movies.  In my opinion, he's the only reason DC Comics is worth anything.  The Dark Knight returns is epic, nothing is held back.  This film is incredible.  Thanks Mr. Timm for all your years of hard work.  Your interpretation of the DC universe is truly the best one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! It is challenging, not too easy, not too hard. It is very addicting and you will never get tired of it. I highly recommend this game. It never gets old, you will never get tired of it. I recommend this game. It is appropriate for all ages. Wonderful game. If you are not sure you want to download it you should. Better yet, it is free! 5 Stars!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I used this device for a bit over a week, and my wife coincidentally got her Fitbit Flex the same day.  I think that the biggest issue with these activity trackers generally is that they are not a panacea; they are just one tool you need to use if you want to get in shape and/or lose weight.  What I like about the Pulse is that the iOS app/website integrates with myfitnesspal (a food tracking app/website), among other apps, so you can create your own comprehensive health/fitness tracking system.  But between the Pulse and Fitbit Flex (which appear to be the best of their kind right now), the biggest choice is whether you want a wristband device, and if not, get the Pulse.<br /><br />If you have a mobile device that syncs with the Pulse, it's great, but with a few drawbacks.  The main one is that unlike a wristband device that you wear all the time, you have to keep moving the Pulse to whatever you happen to be wearing at the time.  I suspect a good percentage of Pulses sold will get tossed in the laundry accidentally and die a premature death.  That's the second main drawback:  it's not waterproof.  It's claimed to be weatherproof, but I suspect a good bit of that depends on using it in the supplied silicon clip, which covers all of the openings.  The other main drawback is that this, like every other similar device, is a glorified pedometer, so it can't measure certain types of exercise, like cycling.  (But then you can use a compatible app to log those activities.) Other negatives are the somewhat fragile matte/rubberized finish (mine shows a fair bit of wear already) and the less-than-advertised battery life (I doubt mine could go two weeks based on my usage).  The display also is almost impossible to read in sunlight.<br /><br />I use the Pulse mainly as an activity tracker (versus obsessing over elevation gain, miles walked, etc.), and it has worked perfectly with my iPhone 4S so far.  It's easy to check your pulse with the unit, and between the Withings app and a compatible app like myfitnesspal, it's very easy to \\"roughly\\" monitor your food consumption and calories burned.  Add any scale, and you're set.<br /><br />As much as this is an amazing device given its size and cost, it's a waste of money (because pedometers are cheap) unless you take the time to maximize its benefit by using it consistently, monitoring your food consumption, and logging the activities that are not captured by the device.  The technical gee-wiz factor wears off fairly quickly.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|This isn't a bad action movie. I've seen far worse. But it is off putting to hear people in period costumes sounding like NY cabbies in a traffic jam on a 100 degree day. This is lazy writing and adds a jarring anachronistic feel to the thing which is often the death of fantasy. Here fantasy doesn't die but it is on f$%@$% life support.
B000CNESU8|5.0|I saw Network when it was first released in the 1970s, but somehow I missed all the re-runs of it over the decades. I recently bought the DVD and watched it again with pleasure, delighting in the performances of all the actors - William Holden, Peter Finch, Fay Dunaway, Robert Duvall, and others. Paddy Chayefsky's script is as meaningful in today's world as it was more than 30 years ago. In fact, maybe it means even more, as so many of the situations have truly come to pass. Television and &#34;the news&#34;, the impact of television on our lives, corporations and the profit motive - it is all there. If &#34;the news&#34; was dying when Chayefsky wrote the screenplay, then it is dead and buried now. Just look at what purports to be the news media and tell me you live in a world where you can trust what you see and hear on any of our public airways. If you have never seen this film, then you should see it. If you saw it years ago, watch it again, if only for the great Peter Finch!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and I think it gets better and better. The DVD has so many great bonus features too!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The series is very well done.  Although a great deal of the presentation is subject to interpretation, the context is built on historical fact.  The actors did a fine job which makes watching very enjoyable.  It was also nice to watch the entire series together within a couple of days.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle continues to entertain, surprise, beguile and amuse in this Second Season collection.  The cast is supurb and the writing  first rate. But it's Nathan Fillion's &#34;Rick Castle&#34; that is a treat to be savored like a chilled glass of wine.
0770437400|5.0|The book was really written in an unconventional manner but covered a lot of ground in illustrating all forms of human failings: fear, greed, pride, ignorance, short-sightedness, denial, procrastination, mistrust, tribalism, etc.<br />The book was a collection of short stories told from the viewpoint of survivors.<br />The story told by the disgruntled vet who survived the 'Battle of Yonkers' was priceless and worth the cost of the book alone.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I LOVE this time-waster!  LOL!  DANG THIS GAME!  This one is my new fave......Thanks!  I can think of a lot more symbols for a different one, too!  ha
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|love the game not enough levels and variation. it starts you over too far from where you left off. purchasing additional powers is VERY misleading.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A very good game for young children because it helps them to expore their fine motor-skills, and eye hand movement.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|love love  love  love  love love it love it love it love it love it  fun as hell hope the next one is even better...
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! An easy read, but with lots of meaning. Great ending too for such a hard life that Victoria led in her adolescent life.
B00005JLEU|5.0|WOW I GOT IT .. YES YES IGOT IT AND I LOVE IT ...  THE BEST THING IS THE PRICED LIKE OH MY GOD ..
B009GEDP26|5.0|Did not start watching season 5 until season was almost over.  Hated the last 3 of 4 episodes.  'Still' was the only good one of the last 4.  I purchased the early episodes to get a better grasp of the season.  Unfortunately it ends like so many of the seasons before, Beckett once again displays her complete selfishness and puts Castle to curb.  I am fed up with the writing on this show.  Ship her of to DC and give Castle a new love interest so he can be happy and I can find another show to follow.  The way they have developed Beckett 's character as a selfish self-centered primadonna is so complete I have considered using clips of her best selfish scenes in my church Bible study to give a visual of what original sin is and how it manifests itself in an unredeemed life.  Might as well get some good out of this show.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|DOES NOT WORK NO MATTER WHAT DO NOT BUY THIS NO MATTER HOW GOOD IT LOOKS OR SOUND  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Like Yahoo mail already and wanted to be able to check e-mail while away from my PC.  Protects very well from spam which I like very much!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game id awesome I took my friends advice and I don't regret it I mean really I love playing this game
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Doesn't work as none of the aps load. Don't waste your time or money on this download.  It's worthless as far as I am concerned.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The app is very useful.  I love the fact that when I am somewhere I don't have my kindle or a book I can just pull up my books on my Kindle App for Android. I would recommend it for anybody who reads whenever they get the chance. And even for those who don't, its a fantastic App.
0316743003|5.0|This is a great read.  For anyone interested in the history of \\"stealth\\" it provides a great insight in to how this country's stealth technology was developed and fielded.  It goes into the birth of the U-2, SR-71 and F-117.  I highly recommend this book.  Very informative and entertaining.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game and I do play others but this is my favorite.  Sometimes takes awhile to get collection items but not impossible.
1400049628|4.0|Good book, fun to read and entertaining. Max brooks is a genius with a big imagination. Highly recommended for all of you zombie lovers...
0316227706|3.0|There was a level of disappointment...if he had placed the picture of the dog from the back..next to the dog underwater...it would have been much more enjoyable,
B005GVF95O|3.0|We got the &#34;free&#34; version which has very LIMITED capabilities.  My granddaughter (4 yrs) loves puzzels so we eventually had to buy the paid version to unlock the other puzzles.  She seems to enjoy it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is an outstanding product. The only thing that would make it better would be if it came with an owner's manual.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My 4 yr old granddaughter is a huge Despicable Me fan.  She saw this and had to have it.  Started playing immediately and she really likes it.
B006QV30JU|5.0|The story is still fresh and romantic, the music very beautiful.  It's just incredible how one can see and experience musicals that are some 60 years old and still be touched by them.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old's birthday and he loved it.  Spent hours putting it together right away.  Was great to come across a &#34;hard-to-find&#34; Minecraft product.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This series was riveting, I could not stop watching it. A bit racy for children but if you're an adult Yes!!!
B00E193TM2|4.0|There old sound is coming back on this album in my opinion, which is good because I loved their self titled and War is the answer. My only gripe with this album is that some of the songs I feel like I heard before only with different lyrics. Overall though it is still head bangin worthy.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I'm  a fan of James Wan.  This movie is so well made and entertaining  to say the least. He is a very talented rare director .  His choice in actors that are not big name stars add to the charm of this movie.  I will give no spoilers,  however in my opinion the first 30 minutes is just as good as the last.  I am really looking forward to Insidious2.
B000X97Z60|5.0|I recently just started branching out in my metal listening and discovered these guys. I feel like I am fighting dragons when I listen to this music. From what I have read their older stuff is even better!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|The disc skipped quite a bit. I could not find any obvious scratches.  It did have stickers from a library system so I am assuming it was well used by the time I received it.  I just was disappointed in the condition of the movie.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|Fantastic album! This is a complete package. With three veteran songwriters working together it's a foregone conclusion that there are some great songs. The music and voices are superb and the harmonies are outstanding. Well done.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This is the world's worst game in my opinion. Everything is terrible the graphic especially. How does anyone like this game it has no point to it at all. And that is all I have to day about that. Please agree with me
B004PGO25O|5.0|Steven Pressfield hits right where it hurts. Honest, valuable advice for those with artistic/entrepreneurial spirits. Get a kick and start working.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|As always, it takes a little time for a new CD to grow on you. But it is a very easy listening CD and I would recommend it to all. Terrific Bruno Mars.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|Pam's going to say my left brain is interfering too much with my review. But if manifesting your desires were truly that simple wouldn't almost everyone on the planet be fit, beautiful millionaires? I spent my entire career willing my next career move to happen. I could taste it, I had that much confidence. I visualized it, prayed for it, saw myself in the position and place I wanted. I even had the expertise and talent and looks to get me there. I worked hard on the job hunt, very persistently and motivated. But none of what I wanted ever happened. It is a dog eat dog world out there and there are many factors that go into why you don't get that dream job, every one of them out of your control. That is why hardly any of us achieve the concepts of the whole manifesting idea. I did these experiments and can't say any of them worked. I tried hard too! I opened my mind, shut my left brain up, and put my intention into the FP. I was excited! But I didn't experience the wonderful concepts Pam gushes about here.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I could never watch the Sound of Music too many times. From the first time I watched it many years ago when it came out in theaters I was hooked. This DVD is wonderful and I will enjoy it time and time again !
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl A Novel was a very interesting book, kept me guessing along the way, would make a great movie.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Light, fireworks, death and destruction what more could one expect to a long and conning ending to the wheel of time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you like White Collar you will love Suits. This show is about Another lovable con man that you root for to win!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Persuasion is one of my favorite books of all time and my most read Jane Austen book. The story of Anne and Captain Wentworth is beautifully written, tested by time and people. The characters are very well rounded, from the high strung, superficial ones to the more gentle and sensible ones. Like all of Austen's works it provides for social commentary, the lives of title holding people that are careless with their money, like Anne's father and sister, the Royal Navy, which holds appeal for young men seeking to make their fortunes and win their lady love.<br />This version of it is very well formatted, I've already read it a bunch of times!
B00008G8M4|5.0|Exciting and well acted film. Love the humor and the special effects for the film.<br />Some of my favorite actors also made this film a keeper!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love the DVD...Thank you for sending it to me. I saw the movie at the theater. I will watch it over and over again! Great movie--great actors!!
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Slow moving and filled with wholes. James Franco was eh. Didn't finish it or should I say couldn't finish it. It's pretty bad.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|don't waste ur time this game is horrible I hate it on one level it really messes up and makes u fall really easaly so don't even waste ur time I deleted this horrible game
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I didn't love this book. The first half was very slow and hard to follow. It picked up after that and I liked the surprise ending.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I couldn't wait for Adichie to publish another book and then when it came out I was stunned by its length.  I read the reviews expecting them all to be positive and was annoyed when someone e said anything negative.  I feel like I've travelled back in time, to Nigeria, to being in the presence of rich white people and how blackness unveils its humanity to them, sitting in an African hair salon, to President Obama's first election. It's always painful when her stories end. I loved this story and I love Adichie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game reminds me of cityville on Facebook, except when you place roads you can't move them, also you need a lot of factories to make things to go in the mall, but overall it is a very fun game!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The world that Hugh Howey created is awe inspiring. This book will draw you in, make you ask questions and keep you wanting more. This is an incredible story and I thoroughly enjoyed Hugh Howey's writing style.
B000OLROWC|5.0|Will always love this movie.  Let my kids watch it to compare to the new karate kid with jayden smith and surprisingly they really liked the movie.  They were entertained from beginning to end.
0425263924|1.0|I probable skimmed over half of this book. It was so boring. I got tired of the use of the word c*nt. Not sure if I will purchase the next book.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love listening to my Amazon music in my car, on the road.  It is very user friendly and I recommend Amazon MP3
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time on my kindle I got the update. any way I think mojang should come up with more games just as great as this one. thc.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|What can I say? The Queens are back and the Stone Age has never sounded so sweet before.<br />If you're a fan you undoubtedly have this already.<br />If you're not a fan, just go ahead and try this. This is just some of the best music around anywhere right now.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My girlfriend asked for this song. I purchased it. She likes it. She dances to it. I am also happy!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|except for the energy level deficit if you do not to pay for cash, it is a really fun game.  frustrating because you are really limited in how much you can do in a short time.<br /><br />UPDATE: the recent update to the program makes the app unusable.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Can't wait for the new challenge every day.  It's always fun to see what I can buy with my gold bucks.
B000031WBQ|5.0|ALWAYS preferred THIS version!!  Huge fan of the C.S.O. since the mid 60's  Sir Georg Solti  & Fritz  Reiner both. This version of the 'Rhapsody...OP.43' is  the FINEST performed I have EVER heard (IMHO) The remaster sounds well-above average also. Never saw this performed in our many visits to see the CSO back then. The speed of Rubinstein  and the sheer dynamics are emitting a broad smile of delight from me as I write this! An excellent example of what its all about, regardless of any tired cliche's!! May I also state that I feel the RCA version is superior in audio quality. I felt my original LP sounded astonishing for its time!----I'm  amazed how well engineered this powerful and graceful piece is in all its splendor.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|No value here.  Acting less than expected.  Action was fine but the story was very weak in my judgement.  Save your money.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|If you like your games as much as I do, this is for you.  In fact this is my second unit, my first one lasted many years before starting to flake out.  The first one went down when the lighting and the joy stick stopped working.<br /><br />I find it better than a keyboard mostly because I sit in a recliner where the space is kind of tight, and this sits on one leg.  I use the Razar Naga Epic for my mouse which adds 12 more buttons (the G13 has 24x3 plus a joy stick), plus they are both programmable to use as you see fit.  So between the two you can rock through any game.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Very well cast, well acted and well directed 'cowboy' scifi series which never gained a large audience and was cancelled after a single season.  Many things made no sense from a science perspective but had the right mix of adventure, drama and humor to be endearing.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|The trailer looks much better than the movie actually is. Don't waste your money in this one.<br />Despite the stars they were somehow able to sign up for this flick it still is unbelievable boring.<br />One scene was especially bad when the joes were shooting at someone and the next scene just showed people laying on the floor.<br />Did the special effects guy take day off?<br />BAD BAD MOVIE!!!!!<br />Bruce and Dwayne, what were you thinking?
0714864803|5.0|Middle Eastern food has been my favorite for a long time, but there are no good restaurants in my area, so I finally bit the bullet and asked for this book last Pascha. (Okay, I also ordered and paid for it, but I promised to give my husband credit.) I just opened it last week in preparation for the Dormition Fast, when we eat vegan for two weeks. I've tried 5 recipes so far, and as far as I'm concerned just those 5 are worth the cover price!<br /><br />It is difficult to convey the scope of this cookbook: there are over 500 recipes, including many variations on a theme (half a dozen varieties of hummus, for example.) It's easy to be overwhelmed, so I recommend starting with a few of the basics. Last week I cooked Hummus (38), Baba Ganoush (46), Fattoush (40), Walnut and Cayenne Dip (49), and Pickled Turnips (484). Every recipe was a gem: full of bright, healthy flavors, simple to prepare and -- best of all -- tasting exactly the way it does in good Middle Eastern restaurants.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of prep work, since you're working with such fresh produce, but most things can be chopped and blended in bulk ahead of time: I did that and after one afternoon of cooking, I ate delicious leftovers all week. The flavors really develop after a few days in the refrigerator, and the food is even better. I'm already planning a birthday party for my mom next week, including those 5 and a few others (Falafel, Fried Cauliflower, Tabbouli, Semolina & Almond Cake. Hungry yet?)<br /><br />Someday I hope to be able to try every recipe in this book! I know it's ambitious, but God willing, I have many years to work toward that goal. :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game that is fun for the whole entire family. Beating your high score is a fun and difficult challenge that keeps you on hour toes.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|On the app I saw an ad.It said that my tablet has one virus. It was an android virus locked.And  then it told me to download it so I did,My Lookout&reg; Virus catcher said there was malware on the downloader so I deleted it so yeah.The ads could be malicious or could have other viruses.So I recommend you dont click the ads. The app is great so far.Just the ads
0553801473|5.0|The 1st time the book was lost by the USPS.  Owner replaced and showed up about 1 day later.  Courteous owner.  It would be better if we had a tracking number for the USPS parcel because we had no idea what had happened to it (as many others have found out).  Book was in excellent condition and wrapped well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the various levels of difficulty.  At first I thought the game was a snap.  Then with progression things took some thinking.  Now I'm at the level that I periodically get stuck - good fun if you like puzzels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time. Lots of different horses and many things to do.<br />Different jobs you must do to keep your horses happy.
0060574216|5.0|I bought this book when my wife seperates from me. I know wish! I had bought it months ago.<br />This is a well worth book for anyone having troubles in their relationship or just to make sense of different thing we do as people.<br />Hope I get to use it with my wife.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have to say this is the most awesomest game ever on the planet! It's so cool and you can craft weapons! It's so cool!
B00004X01U|2.0|This album, just like American Life- sounds much better Remixed. The original state of these songs are generally not good in my opinion. I'm a huge Madonna fan (but not a sheep at all). What's good is good and what's not good is simply not good. Since Ray of Light was released Ive been bored until Confessions on a Dancefloor was released. I feel that this album is a continuation of the same Madonna who released Ray of Light. Different album, same taste.<br /><br />As I've already mentioned in my American Life review, Im a pop/dance fanatic when it comes to Madonna as an artist and I prefer a more traditional pop sound or atleast if she was going for something different atleast create something fabulous. These songs have the power to put anyone to sleep.<br /><br />Music and Don't Tell Me are the standouts in my opinion. Impressive Instant is really good but that loud noise kills it. Runaway Lover is catchy but sounds better remixed. Amazing sounds better remixed as well. Impressive Instant sounds much, much better remixed- that annoying sound is toned down to almost zero and the autotune is blended better and you can actually listen to it. The GHV2 version of 'What it feels like for a girl' is also much more becoming than the album version.<br /><br />The initial state of the album is boring and lacks energy (for me). The style of the album versions of these songs are a more mellow sub-genre of dance music. Its not high energy or actual dance music. Yes, it has all the elements of dance music in some tracks but the instrumentation and chosen synthesizers are used in more trip-hop or lounge styled dance music. I cant see anyone in the middle of a dancefloor getting down to Runaway Lover. Even though its uptempo and fast paced it doesnt have that same 'get up' as a real dance beat. Its more of a relaxed style of club music. The energy is just not there, its just not present. I could here Music being played on low in a modern lounge with recessive lighting and business casual dress. Its too contained for my taste.<br /><br />Theres also other songs like Paradise, Gone, I deserve it- these songs from what I remember almost put me to sleep. I was bored, I dont think any remix could save these tracks. When listening to an album the music exists before the artist (to.me). For instance Confessions on a Dancefloor is a dance album that happens to be by Madonna as opposed to Madonna's got an album out and thays all it takes for me to know Ill love it. It just so happens that this same artist happens to put out music that im constantly charmed by. Its like eating at your favorite restaurant, you know what you love and they constantly deliver and it always happens to be that place in particular that continues to provide that taste you love. Same with Madonna...<br /><br />I love Madonna as an artist but im not impressed with this album at all. There's another song titledLiquid Love that was recorded with William Orbit that was supposed to be used for this album but it was dropped from the tracklist. I found it odd that it wasnt something from Ray of Light, as it sounds more from that album. I dont like its original state but the remix is phenomonal. Music, personally could've been more 'beat' driven. To title an album Music, these songs dont sound very musical. Very drab anf bland, but again the remixes are astounding. Madonna just needs to except that shes a dance artist, that should be her focal point. All this other drab nonsense needs to go. After hearing Music I knew this album would be hot. Such a letdown, but whatever ive got the remixes and they slam this bs.<br /><br />Madonna's signature sound is anything pop/dance. If she explores or experiments it should only be with a few songs or within her realm as a dance artist but not full length albums of mellow,trippy music with no basslines or rhythms. Just my opinion...<br /><br />Update: The tour version of 'I Deserve It' is really good, its much more dynamic and spiritual in the live performance. More dramatic, love it.ve performance. More dramatic, love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game. Reccomend it to every body young and old. Love the horse pic on here. The unicorns are wierd but cool and expensive.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|For Android, this car charger seems to be able to charge up to 1/2 the speed of a wall charger. Not sure if that's great, but it's good enough for me. I only had one test though
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This was a fun game it took a nice amount of time. I like that there was a nice variety of tasks.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|It was a really good book I could barely put it down wanting to know what was going to happen but really wish it would of elaborated more on their love story!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book you should read it it is a great story and I think that lots of other people would enjoy it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This book is about trust in relationships between the male character and the female characters through whose eyes & voice the story is told.  The fundamental question that Will, the lead character, in the book has to account for is keeping is promises to the 2 females characters in the story line. What make it difficult for Will is that one  is grown up and the other is a teenager. Both have their on ideas about what it means to keep a promise.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a sad and happy at the same time. I would recommend it to my friends. Could not put it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A friend who also read the book said that they didn't think it was important to read the final book, however I disagree.  It wrapped up the story very well and was a satisfying conclusion.
1250012570|4.0|When my daughter said I had to read it, I sighed. She is responsible for the book hangover I was still experiencing from The Fault in Our Stars, after all. Another tragic, well-written-but-technically-YA book? Yes. But I am still reeling from the last one! Then she hit me with the fact that it was set in the 80s and referenced music s lot. &#34;Think 'Say Anything'&#34; she said.<br /><br />Great. Lloyd Dobler. My Kryptonite.<br /><br />So. Yes, it reminded me of Say Anything. The music references made me laugh (Echo & the Bunnymen! My favorite Elvis Costello song! XTC, even... It was like a time warp right into my past). The descriptive details of clothing were damned spot-on. These kids could have been my friends. If I went to public school, of course ;)<br /><br />I liked it a lot. I stayed up too late and woke up early to finish it in a hurry (long waiting list at the library, apparently). I even caught myself wanting to flip ahead because I was so eager to find out what happened.<br /><br />And that's all I'm going to tell you about Eleanor & Park. You have to read it.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|I've Got Your Number was an enjoyable book. Made me laugh at loud. Very easy and quick to read with likable characters
1439190275|5.0|Third time for me on Atkins - once looooong ago where I dropped the weight so quickly it was almost unhealthy. The second time I wasn't as disciplined and it just didn't work. This book is easier to follow than the old one, has better science, and a little better guidance about what and why. Don't knock it until you've read this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great...game..I enjoy it and my 5 year old and 17 yr old. Love it. Very versatile.would buy upgrade ..children play everydAy. Great app
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Kinda a coming of age story , it was obvious the book was better but all in all it was a pleasant diversion.
0425266060|5.0|Loved these books, can't wait for more in the Crossfire Series. Sylvia Day has a hit with this story Line.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I definitely wanted to keep reading and was into the story for the most part, but the content (especially further into the book) just got pretty ridiculous.  I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, but it wasn't the worst book.
B00005JA8B|4.0|Great classic action flick I have always loved this movie arnold is the greatest action hero of all time hands down
B008XBHIEY|1.0|This movie had a &#34;PG&#34; rating but the opening scene had the woman running on the beach with frontal nudity and swimming in the nude.  I saw this movie as a teen and while I expect some profanity, I did not expect myself along with my teenaged children seeing nudity.
B00992CF6W|4.0|love it not its not letting me download I went to two different wifi locations and still its not letting me
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Love this movie wanted it for a long time.As usual only could find it on Amazon. Can not stop watching it so good.Want a good movie buy Planet of the Apes with James Franco.
0142421715|2.0|I finished Matched and had some reservations about it.  Not sure which way the story would go.  Reading Crossed, I totally lost interest in the story.  The background story was almost totally lost.  Spoiler Alert - Cassia and others sent to work camps, land of outer provinces.  They stink. I miss my unconfirmed match. - End of Spoiler  That is pretty much all that happens in the first couple hundred pages.  The character development wasn't there.  I promising background wasn't developed.
B000FVE3BG|1.0|The watch is nice looking and works well, but it is huge and very heavy. The watch is thick as well.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It was a cute movie to watch with my mommie!! Definitely worth watching. And amazon makes it easy to watch on my roku!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A great read. A different story for a change. What an imagination. If you read it, make sure you pay attention to the titles and dates of each chapter.
B000HZGNH2|5.0|I truly enjoyed this time spent watching the movie.  Money well spent.  Time well spent. i recommend this movie completely.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I fell in love with this song and then I started hearing it al over the radio. I was very happy about that. Great song, you should download it.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Why this album is not a huge success is a mystery. Great songs, harmony vocals and production. Three good songwriters who can really sing seems to produce an excellent recipe for high quality music.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Enjoyed the story line, could not put this book down! Every parent of a teen should read this book, especially in the world we live in today
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This film is a seemingly realistic portrayal of life in the mid ranks of the Mafia.  Rather than paint a romantic picture, this film has grit. it is dark and brutal. The acting by the ensemble cast is incredible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such an awesome game, angry birds sucks tbh, i like this one better, more exciting and nerve-racking. Bitch don't kill my vibe.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Was good<br />flick. Brought back memories of my brothers g I Joe dolls.<br />Would watch again .  My boys loved the action
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Started this book benignly enough at 930pm on a typical Wednesday night before bed. Needless to say, I finally went to bed at 430am. A great read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|that's a lot of money! I hate teasers like this.  either its a free game or a paid game, I feel duped otherwise.
B0014DQSGW|4.0|This is a funny movie that is a great choice for a date night or something similar. If you are going to watch a chick flick with your girlfriend or wife this one is an excellent choice.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I read the book, and the movie follows the book for the most part.  I loved Emma Watson as a &#34;bad-girl.&#34;  It was nice to see her playing a complete opposite of her &#34;Harry Potter&#34; character.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I didn't put it down for an hour the first time I played it. Even though you can pay for power ups it's not necessary for playing the game. As the levels get harder you might think about buying powerups tho. It's your choice.
B005ERIRZE|4.0|Author guides the user through a series of issues that one may encounter when trying to build their willpower and discipline. Enjoyed the end of chapter summaries to ensure I didn't miss anything.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The few days we were able to play this game, it was awesome! But since the update a couple days ago, it will no longer load on the Kindle Fire. I really hope this issue is taken care of soon!
B001KMB6X2|4.0|If you love Vin Diesel you must get this movie. It's not his all time best, but he still puts in a great performance and the supporting actors are great too. The movie has an acceptable ending that I wish they could have made an alternative too, but still the movie is great and worth adding to your collection, especially when you find it cheap.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I run a page on instagram and this app is amazing for the needs I have. I highly recommend this app to anyone
B00003CXGG|4.0|I like this movie, you can tell Jet Li is coming alone in his English, but it works so well in this movie. And I miss Aaliyah so much, her music was great and this is one of the few films I can see her in so I knew I must buy it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is like all the other Angry Birds games unfortunately, brilliant and very addictive. Once you start playing you can't stop.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Good story, good characters but my husband and I both felt it was too violent! Overall pretty good movie for a Saturday night.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Beautiful music, a soothing voice, and just overall very relaxing. Some fun tunes mixed in with some less happy tunes helps round things out. I could listen to this pretty much any day, all the way through.
B004IJZFP4|5.0|Had this on vinyl but was lost or stolen.. had to get it back somehow. and just never lost the appreciation of this album and 'Private Eyes'
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|As the day progresses the temperature updates can really vary from reality.  Lately while weather has not been as warm as predicted, the temperature variations remain in place for the warmer prediction.<br /><br />Otherwise , I like the convenience of being able to check how the weather is doing for the day.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This ever famous trilogy has a very good beginning, with great characters and an enticing story line which easily hooks the reader.  I could easily identify with the main character.<br />As the plot thickens, it becomes difficult to put the book down, which may lead to loss of sleep (if you read in bed) or loss of work (if you read at your work desk), etc.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is a classic movie. I bought it under the guise of getting it for my child, but really, it is one of my favorite animated films.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The author tends to repeat many of her phrases/lines in this 2nd book, which does tend to get on my nerves a bit.  She also repeats many intimate scenes, whereas keeping things fresh and new would have been more interesting and keep attention focused.  I must admit that I did skim over many, many paragraphs of repetition in this one.
B0094K1PW4|1.0|Would not recommend to anyone.  Thought it would be good because Steven Spielberg's name was on it but was not the case.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After a rather boring 2nd book, I simply wanted to finish the saga, but was not overly anticipating the read...<br />After a slow start, she did, in fact come back to life to insert some new twists & turns to the plot.<br />I became much more interested in the action part of the story, rather than the steamy sexual aspects, because the sexual storyline had gotten a bit repetitive by this time.<br />I was pleased with the ending.
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|This is one of their Best also with their Power Balleds Every Rose has its Thorn and Fallen Angel and also others this is a great Album for Your Arena Rock Collection Anywhere.
0316069906|5.0|I have read others since, but this book is what gave me that push to really pay attention. I read this as I was entering my sophomore year in college and I've been selectively vegetarian ever since. Of course one book shouldn't determine your entire diet but this definitely should be a factor in what you put on your table.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|This is a Very Great Album for Ozzy Tony and Geezer back again just when I get this I will just treasure this same as the good ones and their new Drummer a session Drummer Brad wilk with the same words as Bill Ward haha anyway also produced by Rick Rubin I Deffinitley Recamend This to use all.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|My little man loves this movie. Was excited to get it for a reasonable price. I wish there was another!
B0093OGBL6|5.0|When I got to read the kindle free inside peak in to the Book, I was truly AMAZED & STUNNED!!!!! There are very few Journalists & Authors like Dr. Karen, she obviously did her research on MJ. This book gives me goosebumps. Dr. Karen you truly have out blown ALOT of these fake, money hungry leeches who just want to make money off of MJ anyway they can, but you can tell Dr. Karen really cared about MJ and she didn't exploit MJ. She wanted to get the truth out about the non MJ believers, that he was a loving, caring, giving, unselfish & a damn good father. I can't wait to get my book from Mrs. Karen Moriarty, I know that I won't be able to put it down, as the book is over 500 pages, which makes it much more anticipating on getting the book!!!!  Thank You, Dr. Karen
B003QSS2VW|5.0|My 5 year old LOVED this and i was comfortable to step away for a few minutes without needing to know everything that was going on.  The classics can give you that peace of mind.  No sassy girls, no violence, just entertainment and fun.  She really enjoyed it.
B00B32X786|5.0|wOw  such a good movie to wach over and over again! from start to end a 5 star MOVIE! LOVE IT
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a truly a eye opening book on what our servicemen have to go through in times of war.  We should all be thankfully to our men and women who risk their lives for our freedom.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The Quell series has entertained and challenged me. I've learned to look at things in several different ways instead of just one.
0385349947|5.0|Excellent words of wisdom from a successful professional woman. I would recommend to everyone I know. Men and women alike.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Loved watching it. Missed some of the episodes due to work. May buy it at a later date,  if Big Brother doesn't take all my money.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's ok, but it updates and changes the look to often... I would really rather it kept the same look, hard to keep up with the changes.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Nice sounds. Fun to mix them. I love the timer feature. Very subtle, helps me to fall asleep in a noisy environment.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I must say from the outset that this is not usually the sort of book I would read.  However, something about the title intrigued me.  From the beginning I found the book hard to read.  I can't put my finger on anything particular however found it a little hard going.  Can I just say this.  Keep reading and you will be well rewarded.  By the end of the book I was so immersed in the story I was reduced to tears whilst reading the last couple of chapters.  A story of one man's courage and determination to finish a quest once started.  A fantastic read.
B008469DGY|4.0|easy way to relax the brain. My 4 year old granddaughter likes to play it also. Did not take her but a minute or to to figure out the controls.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|A good read and a valuable resource in understanding the attraction to the internet and how search engines take you through the the world wide web.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It was a typical Clancy thriller.  It moved along at a fast pace and had a lot of action.  Great reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super cool  game!  Great graphics and many levels of play keep it interesting and fun! You won't wanna quit playing!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is one of my favourite gane; I love it!<br />Once you start playing this game you can't stop; it's fun and addictive.<br />There are different characters to get and they are all creative and unique..<br />Every month it updates to a different place, like Tokyo or Paris.<br /><br />One glitch though; it won't connect to my Facebook anymore. It used to, but now it says it can not connect. This is annoying as I want to complete against my friends. Please sort it out.
B004I4M0A2|3.0|The products are too must money and web site is very hard hard to hard to just brows. I would not recommend.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Our toddler loves the ride and it encourages our family to go for nightly trips.<br /><br />If you can change your bicycle tire, you can install the Weeride.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This was a fun experience. I enjoyed every aspect of the game play and creativeness.<br />I would highly recommend this game.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|When I got this backpac from amazon I was looking at it because I needed a really good case that was inexpensive for my gopro. I looked at the pictures and they do not do the amount of space justice. I have roughly a third of the pack filled and have all of my accessories in the bag including the gopro itself. The loop on the side of the bag for the pole could be a little better as it is a piece that runs through some material and is not thin to where if you had a monopod in there it would stay. What I had to do was open the pouch under those two loops and place the bottom of the monopod in the pouch. That is my only complaint on the bag. The straps that go across your chest and belly adjust fairly easy and are out of the way once you have it tightened. Would recommend this for ant person who needs room for a small camera with accessories or a professional who has many lenses.
B0089X38EU|4.0|I always liked Booker T and the Mg's.  Glad I bought this CD.  Great to listen to while driving or workong around the house.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Girls need to read about flawed heroines. Perfection is hard to attain and Katniss shows young readers that people can make mistakes and still have great qualities.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is handy when a cord serves two purposes, i.e. for rapid charging and for access to one's computer so one can upload photos etc.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Never expected that they can recreate there first and second album but they did.... Worth the wait...OZzy ur the best!
0810970686|5.0|my 8 year old gran son is obsessed with these books.  He was very happy to add to his collection.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This cd is in heavy rotation in my car and on my ipod. I feel it is even better than their last one.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|what a catchy tune!  I have yet to get sick of this song.  I keep playing it over and over again.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I loved this series, and it still free on Amazon  Whenever I get a chance to repurpose something, I go McGyver on it!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This album contains the best songs and talent I've heard on a CD in so many years I can't remember when the last one was.<br /><br />Billy Sheehan is his usual self playing bass at times faster than most guitarist can reach, or just slowing down the beat for the vocals or guitar solo to stick out more.  Either way it was done in a very tasteful way. He and Richie blend together in a way that not many bands can achieve.<br /><br />Richie Kotzen is out of this world with his very soulful voice with more range than anyone would think, and his guitar style is so unique and outstanding that he steals quite a bit of the spotlight - in a good way. I'm sure others have said he sounds a lot like Chris Cornell. It's true. Almost the exactly the same at times.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy is performing drum clinics like a madman as usual and meshes perfectly with the high talent in this band. He and Billy laid a great groove underneath it all when needed and they sounded like they've played together for years.<br /><br />The best part about it all is that the songs are songs, not just guitar and bass noodling without substance plus the talent is off the charts. I like every song on this CD which is almost unheard of from me.  This is the best rock album to come out in a very long time and I hope the current rock bands start taking notice.  This is how to make a rock album become a classic.<br /><br />The only thing that baffles me is why I haven't heard any of the songs on my local radio station yet?  These guys need to be heard!<br /><br />If you like rock music and listen to this and don't like it, you may want to check and see if you have a pulse.
1595825045|5.0|I have been a fan of the show since I watched the premiere of it all those years ago. The first episode had me hooked and I was so sad to see it end. I bought the dvds immediately and while those are just as good, I still felt like I was missing some of the artwork that went into the show. I saw this book and thought about getting it, but wasn't entirely convinced when I looked at the preview. It looked cool thats for sure, but it didn't really show what was in the book and I did not want a book of still shots from the show. On a whim I bought it because my curiosity was to much to handle and I am so glad I did! It is not a bunch of still shots from the show, but delves into how they went through the process of getting the show on the air, the gradual development of the avatar world including the characters, bending and cross-bred animals, and how the story continually evolved until the final chapter. And with each step of the way there are concept drawings by Bryan Konietzko and other equally talented artists that really allow you to dive into their imagination and creativity.<br />Each page was a constant struggle between staying on the page and examining every drawing or hurrying onto the next page. And of course the creative charge that it gives you is insane because all you want to do afterwards is draw, draw, draw! I would not recommend this book to people who want to get to work on time because I know I was late for the following days.<br /><br />In summary, if you love the animated series or animation in general- don't even think about it and get this book right now. You won't be sorry you did. I know I'm not!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|IT IS AWWWWWWWESOME I wish tat it was no. 2 so I can get it and ill play it until I'm tired of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I. Like mincemeat it is awsome you should have<br />Train craft track builder And steam trains and all of the rest
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The castle as Downtown Abbey is perfect, the cast perfectly appointed to this remarkable period piece that unites the classes all the while keeping them seperate, only in Britain could this be accomplished and would we Americans keep coming back for more..great series...have watched them all again and again!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I like the way it changes the further you go. The more you play it through the more surprises show up.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great series it becomes addictive to watch, you fall in love with the 2nd Mass, it's a family in crisis that pulls together against all odds, we humans seem to be at our best in these circumstances, perhaps that's why this series is so addictive to watch!
B0086700CM|3.0|Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. But it does help get you ready for other similar games.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Love the original series even though I know them all by heart, sitll love watching them. I watched the series as a kid and have watched all the series except Deep Space Nine and loved them still.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is lots of fun. I enjoy the different levels of play. Definitely will keep you on your toes.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|One of my daughters downloaded this free app and has been very pleased with it.  It provides good, clean fun with friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The Downton Abbey videos have excellent picture quality and sound.  The story line is excellent.  Each show leaves you waiting to see the next!
B00E193TM2|3.0|Was pretty dissapointed by this lp, its not at all like the others. With excption to the title track. I hope this was a one time thing taking a risk on a different style. And really mixing rap and metal, un f#@*ing american for true metal head. Very dissapointed...
030758836X|4.0|This is a super-fast page turner that you'll want to plow through in one sitting. I think I read it in 2 or 3 days, which is saying a lot because I'm a full time working mom of a 2 year old. Gillian Flynn doesn't mince words, and the story moves at a great pace. You can read the plot reviews elsewhere. I'll just tell you how the book made me feel and to whom I would recommend it.<br /><br />The book is written in the first person, which is a great plot device and also the biggest potential downside. You may not like either of the main characters, and in fact you will likely grow to strongly dislike them. You'll find your feelings about them changing throughout the book, but the eventual punch is probably watered down a bit by the lack of positive connection between reader and protagonist.<br /><br />I think the brilliance of the book is that Gillian Flynn wrote a thriller (in the vein of American Psycho) that has hints of cultural satire embedded throughout. If read purely for the pleasure of a thrill, combined with an appreciation for what this book is trying to say about our sensationalist culture, self-centered obsession with individualism, and culture of misogyny, you'll really enjoy the romp. If you want something equally modern with more of a straight crime-thriller bent, try Tara French.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Out of all the albums, this is by far the best. The lyrics are very personal, just like Ivan said on Octane.  There is so much energy and anger in every power chord, note, and lead guitar.  The LL. Cool J cover is powerfully funny.  Of course this is only my opinion, and you will of course, have to make your own.  This album actually sounds different from the craptastic other bands that are out there currently.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire and it does a good job of keeping it protected.  It's easy to use and looks nice too.
1595827684|5.0|If you are a fan of the ME Universe, you will love the looks into the art and vision this book offers. While it leans a little more toward focus on the 3rd game, it has some beautiful works in it, and is a fantastic comendium that will look great next to the original Art of Mass Effect Book.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|This was the first  book I read by Sophie Kinsekka. I enjoyed reading it, although some of the situations seemed a bit far fetched. It sort of reminded me of some books I read to my children when they were younger about a bumbling housekeeper.  Sophie used the \\"f\\" word a bit much.  There was really no need for her to use it.  I will read more books by her.  In fact I down loaded two more on my kindle already.  One I started to read and did not like it but the second one I am reading now and enjoying it.  I will read more of her books as well.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|Let's get the obvious out of the way. Ghost Rider s a film was... craptastic. While it has redeeing qualities in some areas, and if you are a fan of ol' GR, it is one you can toss in and have playing while you do laundry or something or just add it to the super hero movie collection. This review is on the product. I knew what I was buying, it was as advertised, arrived quickly, and a worthy addition to the collection, despite the films letdown.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I can not get this show out of my mind!! Must see!! You won't stop watching best lawyer show ever.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love or I should say I'm addicted to solitaire! This particular version is very easy to use and I love playing it...more than I should lol....
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have been using the free version for over a year now. On two android phones and two android tablets. The sounds are great. I have not noticed any skipping or looping. I love the variety and that the volume for each can be customized. I have tried other apps but keep coming back to this one.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I can't wait to have my 4 month old granddaughter play with this! I know she is going to love all the colors and sounds...so excited I can hardly wait!!!
1781162646|4.0|Have not yet had a chance to start this book but I know it will be good. Anything by my favorite author is good. I am still waiting for him to top the Stand, the best book he has ever written
0891419063|5.0|Great product! Exactly what I hoped it would be! It was shipped as stated and a good value. I look forward to reading it!
B004XWLN20|4.0|The packaging is great the CD's are stored in good order. A little tough to get out of the holder if you are not careful. THis is a series I always wanted to see but worked 3 -11 and never did get a chance to see the shows. Now I can watch them at my leisure and in order.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minion run is a really fun game and i really enjoy playing it. I can this game for hours upon hours.
1616551607|5.0|This collection of Final Fantasy artwork is amazing.  Everything about this collection is great.  The box feels silky and is quite heavy.  The box holding the three art books closes with a magnet and protects the books completely.  It is probably the nicest box I've seen yet that houses art books.<br />Each of the books contain artwork from a different set of games.  The first book displays artwork from FF1-3, the second book contains artwork from FF4-6, and the third FF7-10.<br /><br />Any Final Fantasy enthusiast should welcome this collection into their home with open arms and display it proudly!
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Readers; This game has all the 'right stuff' rules and all.  But, to date, I cannot make 'heads nor tails' of the game. It is not, I suspect, the fault of the game; I may be as 'thick as a whale omelette', when it comes to this game. If you never played before, head to the Senior Citizen Center for a few lessons, then buy the game.<br /> Happy Gaming
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This collection of Metal Gear Solid games is great for any newcomers to the series.  It contains Metal Gear Solid 1 and MGS: VR Training as download codes for the PlayStation Network, HD versions of MGS 2: Sons of Liberty, MGS 3: Snake Eater, and MGS: Peace Walker, and lastly the trophy version of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.  The digital graphic novels are also included in this bundle.  It is essentially better than that HD Collection that was released a few years ago.<br /><br />As a huge MGS fan I would suggest anyone pick this up and add it to your collection...even if you wait awhile and allow the price to fall a little.<br /><br />As a side-note I just wanted to say that anyone questioning if it has the Twin Snakes version of MGS1...it does not...should not...and you should be ashamed of yourself for wanting that version!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I have watched it multiple times.  This ensemble cast is phenomenal and the story is a classic one.  THe casting is great - I particularly like Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (excellent choice).  I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime with no problems.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great app fun for the whole family. Great if you like the movie.  Love the difference from touch to tilt.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|If you haven't seen this show yet, you are not really living. I'm being completely and totally serious. Do it.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I just thought this was one of the most relatable books I ever read. I was dieing inside when daisy died and so happy when August go  the medal. This started off as an awful book but after chapter two, I couldn't put it down. Read not for anyone else but for yourself. U won't regret it. :D
B004I9G486|5.0|Using it in my Jetta. We seem to have a little trouble sometimes, but were quoted $100 at VW, as opposed to the $15 here at Amazon. We'll deal with the slight delays in play - and it still powers my daughter's iphone, so it's fiiiine!

B001H9JBW6|5.0|This British mini-series is very gripping and responds to an increasing anxiety not only in the UK but also in America about governmental surveillance--surveillance cameras, examination of email, Internet activity, global positioning, anything and everything that is intended to protect us from terrorism but could (potentially) strip away our privacy and our freedom if taken too far. It's a fantasy, of course, along the lines of Orwell's 1984: a what-if, near-future science fiction series that tells about a brilliant but naive mathematician who has lived for five years in China, quietly conducting his research. When he returns to a very changed England to attend the funeral of his politically active brother (killed in an explosion in Afghanistan), he meets his brother's angry and grieving widow and confesses to her that his popular and important older sibling has always belittled him, that he hated him and resented every second it took him to fly across the world to come to a funeral he missed. He and she take refuge in each other; they fall in love, and he is unwittingly drawn into a political, top-secret plan that will change his and her life drastically. Both Benedict Cumberbatch and Anamaria Marinca are brilliant in conveying both tenderness and confused loyalties. The series is thus complex on several levels that are very compelling: in its political message, in its suspense, and in its story about sibling rivalry, love, manipulation, cruelty, and innocence and experience. I was very moved by it.
B00637D114|1.0|Smurfs was unenjoyable Lacking basic jokes And when they try to make one I was crying on the inside I did not even have one smile I although I was laughing at how bad they were The solecisms whole movie was animation which was okay at best Mind you I see clips of this movie on you So therefore I am perfectly qualified to review this I mean if he was unenjoyable in made me want to throw a taco But behind all that I started having tons of people's pockets and implants and children's hats and in my hat Therefore I give this movie one star out of 78 Ah Tortillas
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|The case was priced right, and with Prime shipping I couldn't go wrong. However, whatever the case is made of is pretty cheap. I'm quite careful with my Kindle, but the corners of this case keep wearing down to the shiny undercoating. It looks pretty bad now. To prevent further wear and tear, I knitted a case to put this case IN.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I was enjoying my bean burrito taco watching os  the great and powerful but it just completely ruin the experience I mean I wasn't believing that they were in this place that is stupid and I can I can just buy tacos to  I told you know if I had a dream about me and I need it just wasn't pleasant experience the doctors better though I would not pay money for that movie ever again conditioner
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This film brought me back to my childhood. Even though it's super long, it's worth the watch; especially for someone who watches more short films. The movie kind of reminds me of a sci-fi cartoon version of &#34;The Warriors&#34;. This purchase is totally worth the buy at this price because I can't find this movie just commonly laying around.
B00ADS98FC|2.0|So I marimba - applejack really gracing already but Ashpole head and I was looking in the clouds for looking Brancheau is perfect Movies about a group of very pretty ladies and have a saying it's in perfect Except for Patricia So anyway they were singing against the troublemakers but you don't Pieralli back of my territory and what's his name the law was going to try and do youthat you want to be the law and Anglicization concert singing like to do and then the law shows up again picture address So that Jenny it's perfect one Anyway the ladies win in the end spoiler alert my bad
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great read that keeps you guessing. Flynn is at the top of the psychological thriller heap. Never a dull moment.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|it looks very nice, but its major downfall is goku's joints his head falls off really easily and so do his arms! it's a pain to pose because of the removable body parts. Other than that great figure
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|At last - so many questions from the previous books are answered.  I loved Kaleb - though I didn't think I would.  Still waters run deep.  One of the best in this series.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Not only was the CD exactly what I wanted but the service provided was over the top in excellence.  I could not be more pleased with the entire purchase process!!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Full of action and lots of great stars. Amazing how many times they could so near to losing ground only to get new life
B0073PPNE8|5.0|One of the best stories ever, and the movie is very true to the novel.  Renee Zellweiger is just fantastic as Ruby, we quote her all the time.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I so enjoyed this book by Sheryl Sandberg. Her words resonated with everything I know to be true as a working mother and as a woman.  There are many things that need to change in the world, but I appreciate the reminder that I, too must play my part. Even if I don't plan to be the next CEO of my company, I still owe it to myself to be fully engaged in my work and my company, and that I don't need to feel guilty in any way.<br /><br />The other important lesson that I needed to learn was that I should and will support all the women around me, whether I encounter them in the office or at the playground. We are all doing important work, and we'll only make a difference if we work together.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the different rain and thunderstorm sounds, very real.<br />I like that you can combine sounds, I use a Rain and then mix in thunder storms and whats really cool is I put in the loon sound.<br /> It's the coolest, it's like you're at the lake. GET IT you will love it!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This  is a fun search and find and puzzle game. Beautiful graphics and imaginative scenery as well as beautiful costuming of the characters. Interesting story and plot. I had no problems with the game other than poor targeting on items; this slows the game down a bit. This game is a challenge and must be completed in the order required to complete smoothly.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I had no idea this existed until a friend recommended it based on my bashing of RD Jr.  After seeing it, I have a whole new respect for him. Now Ironman doesn't feel so guilty.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the best series of books I have read. Character development is complex and well thought out. The story moves quickly with out leaving you waiting for more excitement. All in all it's a most read for any fan of fantasy books.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|Just saw this movie last night in 3D.  I let my brain relax and enjoyed the action.  There was plenty of it.  The 3D was fantastic, especially for the \\"side of the cliff action scene\\".  Totally engrossing. When they make pictures like this they are not thinking about academy awards just entertainment.  And entertained I was.  That is the point folks. If you cannot suspend your disbelief then you should not be watching any movie with action heros.  Come on.  Have fun.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|Any suggestions on how to get this to install?  It keeps saying in can't... I've already been charged is downloaded on my device but stops when it goes to install
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|By far, the Atlantis series in the Stargate franchise is the most enjoyable. It's mix of drama, action, adventure, and humor set it apart and make it the BEST of all the rest. The ongoing war between the Atlantis Team and the Wraith makes for good adventure, then mix in the struggles with the back-stabbing Genii and the shape-shifting nanite Replicators and you make it even better. The only problem I have with this series is that they ended it too soon, five seasons was not enough. They should bring back Atlantis for at least another season or two, a full length movie would be fine too, because there are many more stories to be told here, especially since the city of Atlantis doesn't belong where it finally ended up.
140006922X|5.0|One of the most thought provoking books I've ever read.  I'm recommending it to all of my friends. Makes you want to read the bible from a very historical perspective.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wonderful story. Grisham is an excellent story teller. I couldn't put it down. I would strongly recommend it to a friend.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Not very good at all very disappointing did not make a lot of sense would not recommend this one  to anyone
B0091LS07E|4.0|I am enjoying this album.  There is one particular track that is currently my theme song at this point in my life.
1781162646|5.0|Great read!  Just can't beat a good Stephen King story.  This one is a spooky who-dunnit with heart.  You will love it!
B00DYESRZY|5.0|I've always wanted to like F Buttons more than I do, because I like the *idea* of the music they make (alternately pretty/anthemic and ugly/noisy), and this album finally allows for that with a muscularity and melodic backbone their other albums have lacked. It creeps and then crushes, a bit scary, a bit beautiful. Attractive bruising.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So this thing is a slick package. I thought hmm.. for the price sure i can give it a go, although i have several Apple TV's around the house which do what this box does and then some.<br /><br />Considering that Google is a current business that presumably operates on the same planet, please.. why would you even release this thing until it's at least somewhat ready to compete with Apple tv. this thing lacks all sorts of features that apple tv already has and all in all this is basically google's marketing effort to get you to use their Chrome browser.<br /><br />If you are looking for something comprehensive that will work with your TV by extending it's usability drop the extra coin for apple tv otherwise you'll have a nice dust stopper for your hdmi port until google actually puts in some real thought behind this.
B004SVM7BW|1.0|Since Amazon's system is even more screwed than it was a couple of days ago when I gave up on Business Calendar and downloaded it from somewhere else, I can't review it. It shows up in my apps on Amazon, but when I follow their instructions to download it, it's not on the list.<br /><br />Their app store was much friendlier and worth using when the apps just downloaded without all the extra BS.<br /><br />I guess I'm going to bail on the whole Amazon app of the day since it no longer works.<br /><br />Edit: Being as stubborn as I am I tried one more thing. I searched my Apps in the app/cloud section and it found it. Refreshing the list repeatedly did not. So I'll post another review later after I try the app...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this the best doles dopes addicted game but it really good game to play with friends and I would recommend this game to everyone that love the despicable me movies.
B0055AUSMU|5.0|These are great. The sole is beautifully contoured and hugs the sole of the foot very snuggly. The three way adjustment of the straps really helps with that snug fit. The only thing to bear in mind is because the straps are made of neoprene and webbing, they do stretch a bit when they get wet.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I had purchase another case for the new Kindle Fire HD, however, when received my order and placed it in this case ( the Marware Vibe), I was very pleased about how well the Kindle fit and was secure in the holder.  Would highly recommend this case for the Kindle Fire HD.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|As a Trekie geek's girl friend, this was the perfect gift.  However,  The packaging was not the great, the corners of the case arrived broken ( the disc were fine, but several of the green covers were broken off )  and it was to late to send back once the set was put into his hot little hands. But he loves it and says the quality is great.  So there you have it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It's a collection of short stories with very thin threads to connect them.  I liked the book but not as much as his previous books.
B007L5LD9O|3.0|Enjoyed scenery and costumes.  Characters lacked depth in their cast of predictible roles.  Good movie to watch with a chatty friend.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Everything about this movie was terrible...the acting, the writing, the cinematography...just everything.  While I never read the book, it's been quite a long time since I've disliked a movie this much.  I watched till the end just waiting for some action, and nothing.  Awful.  If you have to pay the same $3.99, I hope you garner more enjoyment than I did.  These are a couple of hours of my life that I regret wasting.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Excellent portrait of allowing differences in behavior guided by love.  The story sheds light on common issues in an uncommon humorous story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. Beautifully written. The book was extremely suspenseful, and I just couldn't stop reading it. Anyone who likes a thrilling, futuristic book will fall in love with this book. The characters seemed so real, as if I actually knew them. You just can't help but be envious of Katniss's determination and bravery.
B00499QUK2|5.0|didn't think i'ld like a new age sherlock, but he grows on you. benedict cumberpatch is quite quirky, quirky sherlock.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The Vacation series are so funny.  After the original one, this one is my second favorite.  I never get tired of watching this movie.
B009G78EE2|2.0|I only like a few songs on the whole album. Kinda just wish I hadn't bought it honestly....Too late now....
B000EHSVSC|5.0|The only reason why I can not say this is the best war film ever made is because in 1962 Darryll F. Zanuck produced \\"The longest day\\". Other than that, I believe there never was a better war film than \\"Tora, tora, tora\\". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />This film follows the real history as much as it is possible, therefore there is no really any need to write about the plot. Historical accuracy of \\"Tora, tora, tora\\" is I believe as absolute as it was possible to achieve without using actual warships and planes which fought on this fateful Sunday on 7 December 1941.<br /><br />\\"Tora, tora, tora\\" doesn't enter into much details about the reasons for which Japanese leaders decided to make war to United States - we quickly enter the planning and preparation stage and after about 30 minutes the Japanese attack force (carriers \\"Kaga\\", \\"Akagi\\", Shokaku\\", \\"Zuikaku\\", \\"Hiryu\\" and \\"Soryu\\" and their screen) leaves in greatest secret their base in Kuril Islands and starts for Pearl Harbor. The film then procedes quickly towards the day of the attack, which is then described in the greatest detail, beginning with 183 Japanese planes taking off from the carriers at dawn, with a quickly raising sun providing an unique background... This is one of the most powerful scenes in all the war films I ever saw.<br /><br />The great idea of both producer and director to was to completely eliminate any not historical themes from the film - unlike in \\"Midway\\" six years later... There is no love stories, there is no development of characters - other than the description of real events there is virtually nada. To push even further this angle, it was decided to NOT hire any A-list Hollywood stars, but solid and experienced actors usually playing second roles or minor characters. As a result, with the exception of Jason Robards, all actors playing in \\"Tora, Tora, tora\\" were and are rather little known - but the result on the screen is very pleasant indeed!<br /><br />\\"Tora, tora, tora\\" is THE film about Pearl Harbor attack and it is infinitely better in all aspects than this ridiculous 2001 Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer \\"Pearl Harbor\\" flick. Amongst many of the treasures of this film is a large part devoted to the Japanese involved in this attack: Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, grave and heartbroken at the idea of starting a war he is afraid he can not win; Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (great casting by the way - Eijiro Tono looks really very much like real Nagumo), cautious and anxious; Commander Minoru Genda, the main planer of the attack, exhausted and emotionally wrecked by the stress and last but not least, the enthusiastic and exuberant Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, the man who lead the air attack and send the message \\"Tora, tora, tora\\" informing his superiors that the surprise was achieved and the attack will be unopposed by American fighters.<br /><br />I can not praise this film enough so I will stop here and simply conclude by saying that I saw \\"Tora, tora, tora\\" many times and I NEVER got bored! This is a major masterpiece, a model filmmakers willing to do war movies should study and imitate. To buy, see, keep and re-watch. Enjoy!/><br />\\"Tora, tora, tora\\" is THE film about Pearl Harbor attack and it is infinitely better in all aspects than this ridiculous 2001 Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer \\"Pearl Harbor\\" flick.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|If you've never read the Bible before or if you have been a scholar for many years this translation with study notes is good to own and better when used regularly.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Fun movie to watch for mindless entertainment.  Great cast.  I Certainly hope that Reds2 is equally as enjoyable as the first.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book tells the story of a family from Afghanistan that spans generations.  Each generation must deal with various forms of loss and emptiness.  But it is also a story of individuals finding themselves amongst those who have formed their futures.  The reader is invited into the lives of both the characters and those whom shaped their futures.  Both heroes and villains do emerge throughout the story.  Some villains believe it is for the good of the individuals, while others just exude cruelty.  Although the family eventually finds a way to reunite, it is not without it's tragedies.<br /><br />A must read for Khaled Hosseini fans.  However, I am not sure the story holds the reader as tightly as his previous works.
1589946006|5.0|Decently made rubbery statues of the sea God. 5 large ones and a slew of small ones. I don't play the card game, I actually wanted it to decorate my house, which it did wonders. Small enough that is low key and you will only notice it IF you're a Lovecraft fan.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|a fun brain teaser it makes you think, but don't do it when you are tired it will be frustrating
140006922X|1.0|This writer is completely full of it. If you look at his education he isn't even a religion history major. His pHD is in CREATIVE WRITING and that's what this book is. It has no religious authority and or historical reference. I wasted money this on this lousy piece of work. I also ask could this Muslim write in the same fashion about Mohammad. I doubt it. Thi sis just a \\"nudge\\" to Christianity which he probably has great animism towards. Save you money and time...<br /><br />P.S. I suspect a far left agenda in this book.
0439023513|5.0|Thanks for the quick service.... it's always rough when you're about to finish the prior book in a series and you don't yet have the next book in your hands Lol you guys got it to me fast.
1451627297|5.0|I had heard this was a good book, but am not a fan of horror, (usually a part of most Stephen King novels) so I kept putting off reading it. When one of my book clubs chose it for our next book I had no choice. I was going to have to read it, although I got many reassurances from friends that 11-22-63 would surprise me. I started it and had trouble getting through the first 60 or so pages. One of my friends said that was what everyone who read the book was saying, and that after those first 60 pages, you wouldn't be able to put it down. She was absolutely right!<br /><br />This book has so much in it that I'd never have associated with Stephen King at all. Time travel, a little romance, realistic, believable characters, humor, mystery, a stroll down memory lane for some and a plot that had me turning the pages long after I should have gone to sleep for the night. It's an excellent book, and worth you having to heft it around...it's as thick as an old fashioned phone book !<br /><br />Although the story line does touch on President Kennedy's assasination, ( JFK, the First Lady, Oswald and Jack Ruby all make an appearance) it's still just a part of the whole. The main characters are realistic human beings who are faced with extremely unrealistic situations, and there is a cautionary tale to be told as well. When the &#34;what if's&#34; turn into actual occurences, a price must be paid, and it is quite steep.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! An excellent read for book clubs! The sheer amount of topics that can be discussed can easily make a meeting run overtime. I wouldn't be surprised if there are 2 or 3 part meetings caused by this interesting, intriguing book.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|Grabbed my interest right from the start, easy to read and follow right to the end. This book encouraged me to read more of Dan Brown's books.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|I was disappointed in the casting of the Lincoln lawyer.  He was nothing like what I had pictured when I read the book.  I found the book to be far superior in every way to the film.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is a great read that I would recommend to any athlete or person who just likes to run.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and challenging.  I'd like to see more rooms. A hint option would be helpful for kids.  Overall a great app.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Great game but since the most recent update the game won't load correctly and doesn't work. It won't go past the first loading page.
B001NT057K|5.0|Very entertaining! The kids love listening to this in the car when we are taking a road trip. They love it!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Got  to watch from the very beginning of the first season..was good, there's a lot I didn't understand until I watched them all!  Not a happy subject to think about, but it's something to think about, anyhow!
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I thought this LCD had a battery included that would extend the runtime of the camera... works great but runs the battery down very fast :(  It really is a must have for the H3
0618680004|3.0|I don't really know what to say about this one. It was okay, but it's just one big circle-j. The only people who are actually reading it are those that already agree with Dawkins. Those who disagree would likely shut the book after chapter 1 after he begins calling the Judea-Christian god a malicious kid with a magnifying glass (or whatever words he used to convey that point). As an atheist, I thought it was a really interesting read, and I think it would be great for people who are on the fence about their beliefs, but don't even bother with it if you're religious, because it is just going to offend and leave you frustrated.

B009NY43NY|2.0|Charlaine Harris should have ended this series about two or three books before this dreadful last novel.  I felt that since I had already invested so much time in the series, I should finish it even thought the last couple of books were not very good.  The ending was such a let down to what started out as an imaginitive, though not wonderfully well written, series.
0345452585|2.0|I love Kellerman, and if at the moment, I weren't unemployed with too much time on my hands, I would have thrown this in the trash. I was so very disappointed! The end was not horrible but I had to put the book down so many times out of sheer frustration it surprised me.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think this is a nice little time passer. I enjoyed playing it, can be a little addictive. Good for free.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie when it came out for cable viewers, it was okay. There was a lot of publicity and it seemed to be so popular, I felt \\"out-of-it\\" for not liking the movie more than just okay.<br /><br />Finally, after much peer pressure from the Y/A and Teens librarian, I am reading the series. I just finished The Hunger Games, and I do like it. I am on a waiting list for \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\". I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and at least getting in sync with the rest of the world.
0544139453|3.0|The way this book is written is really great. The whole thing is told to me, a buff American soldier, by a bearded Pakistani man who sits at my table uninvited and unwanted.<br /><br />I don't get to read my own lines, of course. Just his reactions to them. Which is a lot of fun. But the man's life story is a little too much I LOVE ERICA for me, and I'm not crazy about the ambiguous ending - and I normally love crazy endings.
1569242739|5.0|Im allergic to a variety of dairy ingredients so I never get a chance to order dessert. I started trying to substitute nondairy items in regular recipes a few years back with 50/50 success rates. I got tired of looking forward to a homemade dessert and pulling an epic fail out of the oven. I bought this god send cupcake book and it literally took over my world! Now I can eat cake like its going out of style! I make so many successful cupcakes now and with a super reduced guilt factor to boot! I make these recipes for non vegans and even make them gluten free. No non vegan would ever be able to tell the difference. Its full of fun funky and traditional recipes to please everybody, sweet tooth or not! I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody, you don't have to be vegan to enjoy these healthier cupcakes! Try the Pies and cookies recipe books too! YUM!
0452295548|5.0|I purchased the book for my friend who had a stroke (06/24/13); I highlighted all the important areas of this information for the the son (53 yrs.) who would be taking care of my friend (71 yrs.).

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Within the past year we have seen lots of horror release Sinister, Texas 3D, Evil Dead the problem is that these movies either sucked or didn't make sense, until now. The Conjuring is a long over do horror film the movie is about a family moving into a house that's infested with evil spirits. Ed and Lorraine Warren helps the Parron family with their problem by Lorraine's psychic abilities. Ed and Lorraine are true ghost hunters most of their stuff can be seen on youtube. The story for the movie is perfect and not over done, does not have heavy gore, but still have some gross scenes. Best of all we get to see Annabelle the doll not the real one but a creepier very of her. The Conjuring is a definite must see horror film!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Really struggled to get through this book. I've gotten this and I'm really Hoping book five is a little better.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I only watched the original trilogy so far, but the package is a great deal. The original trilogy looks and sounds amazing on blu ray, considering they were made over 30 years ago. It has 3 discs of bonus features, plus the case it comes in is awesome. I originally just wanted the old trilogy but now am glad I got the saga
B005PK56TA|4.0|My family and I have always been horror fans.  When my daughter first recommended American Horror Story I was skeptical.  However, we began watching and were hooked from the first episode.  I love that you're not always sure who's alive and who's a ghost.  Some of what happens is predictable but if it didn't have the classic features it wouldn't be an American Horror Story, right?
B0069UP2PI|5.0|Contagion is a well written, well acted screen play that I found to be totally believable.  It also shows that in our shrinking world of fast moving people and events, what happens in one part of the world can affect everybody else in a very short time period.<br /><br />Doug Dillenberger
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is nothing more enticing than a well conceived plan of attack.  I love the depth and dimensions of all the characters in this book.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|My grandson and I were very disappointed. The ap opened and there was an intro and then when it started to load the next step, it didn't do anything. The good part is that it didn't freeze my kindle. Bottom line-it didn't work.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love Despicable Me mainly because I am a big kid at heart.  I love the slapstick amongst the minions and Dru and the girls.  Grew up with an animator, my Dad, so have always loved a good laugh and  story line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so different than any other games out there I don't play any other games now but this is very challenging.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an awesome game and appropriate for any age group from 3 to 103!!! There are several different puzzles and different sizes of them also.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|I didn't get a chance to see it at the theaters but really enjoyed watching it at home on my couch!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I felt this game was very entertaining. My hubbers and I have a 3 yr old and 7 mo old twins, so every free moment I got it was playing this game. Thank you for creating it.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|The show is fantastic. If you’re reading this review at all, you probably already know that. It’s a bummer, though, that none of the seasons are available in any aspect ratio other than 1.33:1. It’s weird watching something square(ish) on TVs these days.

B002QS5OQ4|5.0|StarGate Universe Season 1 gave a gleamer of hope for all the Star Trek, Star Gate etc fans of seasons filled with adventures of FTL travel to different galaxies. Season 1 developed characters and friendships as rapidly as Destiny  traveled between gates. You begin to get a feeling the undiscovered Master Code Dr Rush searches for comes quicker then the many unexplained abrupt stops Destiny makes for seemingly no reason. By disc 4 you know what's to come. Mutiny aboard the ship brightens the few conspiratorial episodes for a while. Better yet the Transfer Stones can baffle one for a while. Smoke and mirrors help to bring out each actors identity. Not bad for a first season. Season two comes along nicely.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|I had a hard time getting into this...guess I prefer ST on screen than in print. Mr Mack did a good job of translating the well-known characters to the pages of his story, though.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Keeps me interested, love the puzzles in the game. Looking forward to what else is in store.I feel this game is good for all ages.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I think this app is awesome! The only problem I have with it is I finished all the levels that come with it. The problem is that it costs money for more levels
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|This is good stuff and I really don't know what to write since most people have already stated why they liked it.  I just thought it was a clean, fun movie!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I just didn't like it. I thought I would of but I started skipping parts right from the get go
B00CISAPJS|5.0|I thought the graphics were spectacular and the quality great.  The re-write of the story to fit the script and match the old Jack and the beanstalk story was well done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally amazing.  Kinda like subway surfers and temple run.  If you like those other games you'll love this one.  awesome game
B00015YVD6|5.0|One of my favorites and Eugene Levy is hillarious. I did always wish the ending would have been different and Madison would have been able to stay with Tom Hanks Character vs. him having to go into the sea with her.

0316228583|2.0|I wasn't expecting Harry Potter.  I was hoping to be lured into a fictional world with real people.  If Rowling thinks the world is peopled with the likes of her characters, I feel very sorry for her.  Yes, we are all flawed.  But the only characters with a modicum of goodness are ridiculed by the narrator for being dumpy and bad dressers, or tightly wound outsiders.  These are the only possibilities for humanity?  The disdain her narrator expresses for these bumbling do-gooders (Kay and Tessa and Parminder) in her descriptions of them reveals to some extent her own attitude.  Why else would the narrator describe them in such negative terms?  Howard Mallinson (ok, she kind of got the name right) is beneath contempt because he is obese?  This is the narrator's perspective.  Yes he is selfish and inconsiderate and a lecher.  Focus on those qualities, not his obesity.  Did Rowling think we could forgive the others but not the obesity?  I just don't understand the malice she carries for less-than-attractive people.<br />  The worst offender of all --- Simon Price ---- who beats his wife and kids, is crooked and totally without redemptive qualities, skates off to Reading with his family happy to follow him?  What kind of moral code is that?  Yuk.  We're supposed to root for horny Andrew because he may have a chance to see his crush in the future?  Does she really think people are that shallow, that adults would care about this possible glimmer of teenage lust fulfillment as a spark of hope for the future?  An innocent four year old and his sister-victim are sacrificed on the altar of this small town so that the others can take a hard look at their own failings?<br />  Yes, Ms. Rowlings skill with language and description does not fail.  She has the knack.  I just wish it could have been put to better use.
B002GAR3AM|5.0|I haven't seen this series but I am sure it's great. I really enjoy all the L Word series. I look forward to seeing this series.
1611761751|5.0|As a long-time Le Carre reader, I looked forward to the release of this new novel.  The author himself narrates the book, and this, for me, represents the ne plus ultra for the skill of book narration.<br /><br />I preface a brief description of the story by saying that the author displays a hearty skepticism regarding the West's approach to the War on Terror.  Some readers will find this upsetting, and others a verification of their own attitudes.  It represents real food for thought.<br /><br />This is the story of an anti-terror rendition gone hopelessly wrong.  A combined British Intelligence-Antiterror Contractor operation is the basis for a compelling study of the disadvantages of a secret, unrestrained approach to fighting Al Qaeda.  The characters are well developed, and the story is sadly quite plausible.  Midway through the book, the reader (listener) has the nauseating feeling that Mr Le Carre will again leave one saddened by the loss or corruption of his protagonist.  Avoiding a spoiler, I can only say that how satisfying the ending turns out is entirely in the mind of the reader.<br /><br />I would give the book 4 stars, but as a salute to the excellence of the narration, I think it rates 5 stars.
145210655X|5.0|I got this and Vader's Princess for my husband (a huge Star Wars fan) for Father's Day &#34;from&#34; his 4-year old daughter. Having a child in this age range makes the books quite amusing to read, putting Vader in the role of a father. Doesn't work so much if you are not a big Star Wars fan, though. If you have a Star Wars fan with a young child, makes a great gift.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I'm reading (and listening from Audible while I exercise) my way through these great books.  Harry is definitely a tough customer who comes through some dangerous events but still has a softer side.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I hate that I have to write anything on these reviews!!  For anyone who hasn't seen it Avengers is a great way to kill a couple of hours.  Decent action and storyline, enough sci-fi tricks to appease the Trekkies and Treksters.  Dovetails nicely from the Iron Man movies as well.  Spoiler Alert!: Scarlett Johansen is hot in leather...
0345803485|5.0|I was surprised at all the sex in the book & it was kinky, so this is difinatly an adult book not for anyone under 18 I would say. I would rate it at XXX. I read through it & realy like the story if u can look over all the sex.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've been using this a ton since I got it. It's not a do-all streaming device, but I can stream hulu, youtube, and movies from my pc (as long as the movie is encoded correctly). The coolest thing is that I can cast videos from youtube and it puts no load on my pc or phone.
0345803493|5.0|I would recomend this book to anyone who wants a little kinky stuff in their reading. It is definately for ADULTS ONLY.
B008NA2HMI|5.0|Love this book, it's fast paced and easy to read. Lots of behind the scenes info regarding Wall Street which I found very interesting. Perfect holiday book. Can't wait for the movie.
0345803507|5.0|This one was better than #2 & it was not so kinkky as was #1 and #2. It had mystery in it also, something to keep your interest up.

B0011UGLK6|5.0|Jhumpa Lahin does a great job of connecting the reader to the emotional life of her characters through everyday life, rather than forcing such things through overly dramatic events.

B004UNX1LS|1.0|I installed this on my Kindle HD Fire and very soon wished I hadn't.  It was taking much longer to load the movies than using YouTube through Silk (the browser) .<br /><br />Then I found I couldn't view ANY YouTube videos using Silk.  I got an error saying the &#34;plugin wasn't installed&#34;, followed by another message saying that the video couldn't be played on the device.<br /><br />Even un-installing the app didn't resolve the issue.  I had to restore the device to factory settings.

B00DGKQ5I2|5.0|This album has been a big breakthrough for this band already. The lyrics to this album, specifically the songs your moment and fade away they hit me personally. They did an amazing job and would reccommend to anyone
B000002KIK|3.0|Of course they went on with Dio as their next lead singer, but Never Say Die, the last album with Ozzy and the classic lineup. One thing that has always captivated me about Sabbath was, the riffs. So powerful and innovative. Sure they've had great lead singers over the years...But Iommi's riffs seem tame on this album as a whole. Bill Ward's drumming, pretty much the same formula since day one. Just sets the pace, he does have a bunch of insane moments but Never Say Die isn't one of them. Ozzy...well he's Ozzy. But his vocal performance sounds stressed and incredibly forced. The fact of the matter is...the classic lineup was done with.<br /><br />In my opinion, if the guys didn't clash as much as they did. If they stayed the course and actually put their heart and soul into this record. It could have been one of their bests. Some tracks are full on heavy metal. While others are more rock n roll centered. I would recommend this album. Sure it isn't too heavy or innovative. It may be too forced, and the magic may be gone with the classic lineup at this point. But Never Say Die is a good album. Not the best and not the worst.

B0055PMURG|1.0|On vacation and the condo has too slow of Internet to watch. We just watched Bethany surf, so the kids wanted to watch the movie again- wish I could return it...and just buy the hard copy and have it sent to the resort in 2 days with the prime shipping, but it's not possible:( wonder if there is anything that can be done.
B006N57PXG|4.0|A solid read.  Liked the fact that magicians have no actual power but rather rely on demons to do their dirty work.  Hopefully the further books don't read like HP.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love Sherlock Holmes series wish there more shows. I like how they modernized the Sherlock Holmes mysteries,  will there be more shows.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I would recommend this game for all ages.  My 11 year old grandson recommended to his 73 year old grandmother.  That is a pretty good testimoney that it is for all ages.
B00BV1P8NG|4.0|This figure it not quite perfect, but it's still a beautiful figure and a great piece to add to any Ponie Lover's collection. Funko's Derpy is a great vinyl figure - it has a good heavy feel to it, The coloring is smooth and consistent, and the overall design of  Derpy is show accurate.<br /><br />However, there are a couple of things that make this sculp not quite perfect. Like the other Funko Ponies, there is a seam that shows up clearly around Derpy's neck, between her bangs and lower part of her mane, and on a portion of her hair on her tail.  On my particular sculpture, I also had a few paint brush errors on her bottom left front hoof (yellow paint lines) and some thin streaks of yellow on her neck.<br /><br />I can overlook these small flaws as a casual collector and lover of all things Pony, but if you're looking for a perfect sculp, you may want to drive over to Hot Topic and choose your own Derpy if they have them in stock.  These little paint errors vary from sculp to sculp from what I've seen.  All in all, I love Derpy and she's a fine piece to add to my Funko Pony collection!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I've seen the stage play around 6 times, and was really unsure if I'd like this movie version....Boy was I wrong, though they may not have had the vocal range of the stage actors, their acting more than made up for it. Plus it was something about it being so up close and personal that it touched me more than I've ever experienced in stage version. I cried at least 4 different times.  BRAVO!!!!

B00B4804KS|3.0|First, I would like to say that as far as great family adventure movies I have always LOVED Jurassic Park.  And, this past year we got a new big screen TV and decided to go 3D for the fun of it.  So, we also have purchased quite a few movies to enjoy with our grand children.  Many of the new movies have lived up to their hype and even the new Disney classics such as Lion King and Beauty and the Beast we all thoroughly loved in the 3D format.<br /><br />With that said... I was intrigued when I thought of Jurassic Park in 3D and I did my due diligence and read the reviews of what other customers on Amazon thought of the 3D version and they mostly were very favorable. But, frankly after watching it I feel very under impressed.  In fairness though I have to say that the movie was filmed before 3D was considered an option so when Spielberg made this movie he didn't film it to showcase 3D. I think the movie is best viewed in the format which Spielberg originally shot it in.  It's going to be a classic ground breaking fantasy adventure film.<br /><br />Examples of the difference between a movie made in 3D vs 2D would be shot from a different vantage point than a standard 2D movie.  3D can make images that appear to be in front of your TV screen and seem only feet away... but a film in 2D (and this is how Jurassic Park was shot) has the dinosaurs threatening the people in the movie and the people are running from them with the dinosaurs giving the people chase.  In Jurassic Park the scenes with the T-Rex for example has the T-Rex not shown in the foreground and coming right into your living room which is the whole point of a 3D movie... right?<br /><br />I already owned the Jurassic Park Adventure Pack of the DVD trilogy in a nice box set.  I didn't have the bluray version when I ordered the 3D bluray of Jurassic Park.  If I had known what I know now... I would have just bought the 2D version and passed on the 3D one.  Fortunately, the 3D version also comes with a 2D/ DVD & ultraviolet versions included.  The 3D is not poorly done it's just not special like the movie \\"Oz the Great & Powerful\\" which had 3D literally jumping right off the screen at you!  If cost is not a problem then go ahead and get the Jurassic Park with all the viewing options but if you'd like to save 5.-10. dollars then just get the Bluray/ DVD & Ultraviolet version.ultraviolet versions included.

B000U6BT40|5.0|GReat show.  I can't get the SYFY network at home, so this was the first time I had seen it.  It is very funny and unique in its own right.  I would recommend watching Carter, Alison, Stark, Henry, Zoe, Jo, Fargo and the rest of the characters in this scientific reality.  It's amazing all the inventions they come up with or try and fix before something drastic happens.<br />I truly recommend watching.  This is my second time around watching this season and I just can't get enough.
