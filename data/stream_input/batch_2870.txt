B000JMKNVK|4.0|I thought this book started off really slow.  Unlike the other Kenzie/Gennaro books where the pacing was just right, this one felt off until Angie came back full-on and then the story picked up again and was great right up until the end.  Almost feels like Lehane was running out of places to go with K+G and still have it seem fresh.  I almost wish Lehane would do a spin-off series with Bubba Rogowski.  Now THAT would be great!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Sylva Day is the queen of erotic romantic literature. The Crossfire series is fabulous. I defy any woman to read these books and NOT fall in love and lust with Gideon Cross. Our heroin as well is so gutsy and head strong. Eva is a joy to read. This book is so intriguing to read, you literally can not put it down and find yourself desperate for the next installment.
125000098X|3.0|Although I enjoyed this book I was very upset at the ending. When discussing with a friend she now tells me there are 5 books in this series when I was under the impression there were only 3 and this was the final book.  Again I was left hanging when I reached the end. This is a very clever ploy to get people to continue buying books but I will not be continuing to do so as the books take so long to come out that you cannot fully remember the details of the previous books and therefore there is quite a bit of repetition to remind the reader. This is rather annoying. I really felt as though I was ploughing through trying to piece things together and I have a fairly good memory!

B0042GIRYE|5.0|Zac Brown never disappoints!  The music stays with you and you want to share it with your friends.  Love this album!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Can't get into it, it never loads. The tips are very unclear without seeing how it works so you can concur the level.
044024613X|5.0|this book was one of the better ones I have read recently.  I have a son the same age as the boy in this story, so I could relate to some of the father's emotions.  It gives you a good idea of the stress, and you feel for all (or most) of the characters.  There are a couple of twists in the story that are well done, one of which I definitely not see coming.  Plot is well-paced.  Definitely recommend this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Hard to get into until the 50% point.  Then it really was a page turner.  Wow!  I couldn't wait to see how this story unfolded.  Then a lack-luster ending.  I felt like there could have been such a great twist to end the sick game, and then nothing.  The ending lacked satisfaction.  I felt like, &#34;That's it?&#34; which is why I gave it three stars.
0143122916|4.0|Interesting read.  Provides insight into what life must be like for people stuck in the N. Korean prison system.  And for those few that actually make it out.  It kept my attention throughout.  It was not one of those books that I could not put down, but it was well done.  recommended reading.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|i tried to download it on the kindle fire, someone please get this trash off the appstore!! i play magic and i like it but if it wont download its pointless!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Something new .. I like it. Have to get the hang of it. Need to share with Barry H.O.Sockmonkey!  He would get a kick out of this..
B0095P31L6|3.0|The animation was good but it just wasn't what I expected. So someone else may enjoy this style of entertainment.
B00005N5S2|5.0|Never knew the General was so bold. Good for him. The nation needs leaders like MacAurther and congrats to West Point
B0058W74UY|2.0|Linux' SWF is updated to better support old features and track additions Adobe makes. Adobe Flash is no longer maintained for Linux so SWF is vital to support this technology. There is no choice. But when was the last time this app got updated?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was an outstanding book that captivate me from the beginning.  It gave me an insight into the world  of children at risk who have to face the welfare system and have to deal with being placed in foster care.  This book makes you want to change the way abandoned children are cared for.  I highly recommend this book - both thought provoking and a good story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a fun series of puzzles to escape,  clues were tough but it was fun trying to follow the clues for my escape! Nicely done. Needs more levels!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett never disappoints ! ! !  I can't wait for the third book of this trilogy to become available ! !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Every week (typically on a Thursday) our local Best Buy gets 35 deliveries of the Chrome Cast. The trick is to get them before they stock them on the floor -- which means calling them to find out if they received a delivery of the item and then visiting sometime between 3 - 9:00 PM.  I snagged six of them when they had them in stock and everyone in the family loves it.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I read several books a month, usually 10 or more.  Therefore I can usually tell what the main just of a book is going to be by the end of the first chapter.  In this book I had no idea when the second chapter was totally different than the first.  It wasn't until further in the book that I \\"got it\\".  I hope the writer doesn't loose some readers by this lack of some type of bridge between chapters.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love the Harry Potter series, and this is a great value for a nice DVD set. Nothing fancy, but if you're a fan you'll love this.
0817439390|5.0|A creative and concise introduction or review on how to make your camera fulfill your eye's vision. Descriptions are easy to understand for the beginner trying to fully understand the basic ingredients of a properly exposed image. An absolute MUST READ for anyone entering the world of Photography as a Hobbyist or Professional or anyone that wants to take their camera off of Automatic Settings.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! The graphics are amazing. The games are fun. And I love my horses! This app is great :)
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Still on Top is a truly wonderful collection of his greatest hits. I highly recommend it for any Van Morrison fan!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series. I highly recommend it.<br />The different characters and the beautiful scenery makes it a very interesting story to watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game a little hard to follow at first but gets better. Hard to know when jobs need to be done.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Love this album haven't taken it out of my CD player. Best BSB Album Yet Welcome back Kevin missed you.
B001HRJG2S|4.0|The records work great, and I love the colors of them and how it comes with a poster, BUT on the back where it tells you which song is on what record it's backwards. It's like looking into a mirror. It's tricky to read but I'll get over it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great story line!  It's twisted but you can get past that because the characters are so wonderfully portrayed!!! :)
B00785P2QC|3.0|I think it's pretty cool but I wouldn't play it all the time. But still, it's a pretty good game but I don't play it ALOT. I would not recommend this to my friends
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|love the fact that it has the original and the updated version together. Very well done and nicely packaged. Worth the price
B0081336FO|3.0|I gave this 3 stars because I would give it a 2 (slow................very slow..........) and my husband would give it a 4 because he loves Sherlock Holmes and anything Sherlock works for him.  I couldn't get into it, but he enjoys the bright detective at work.
1609611543|5.0|A very informative, honest and credible account on what the food industry has done to &#34;our daily bread&#34; and what we can do to protect ourselves from unwanted diseases.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It is amazing!<br />You can never imagine what is going to happen next.<br />I'm in love with the series, I can't wait for the 4th season to start.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a good game. It is actually free. As others have said if you don't mind waiting, you don't have spend money. I don't like the repetition though which is why I gave it 4 stars. I also hate time limits. It's worth giving it a try to see if it's your kind of game.
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|Why are they rereleasing these movies on Bluray again just to include the DVDs, which are a old format?<br />Just release the unaltered versions that came out in theaters.  The current ones are a disgrace to the legacy of the original trilogy.  Seriously this is stupid.
1400069289|5.0|This book really opened my eyes. I truly enjoyed reading it. I feel like I understand how manipulative advertising is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to start with book three. This book has taken me on a roller coaster ride that I didn't want to end. I just can't be enough. E L James book two is more appetizing than book one. I sure hope I get my filling and am full at the end of book three. I can't wait to start.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The BEST series on TV. tough watching the lose of several key characters i. This season, but wouldn't miss it.<br />Looking forward to purchasing Season 4 ASAP.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is fun but addictive!!  Once you get started you won't be able to stop.  I especially like the timed games.  It makes you think fast.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The cast and writers keep you glued to the show every week. There are no dead spots. I LOVE it!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is not a typical &#34;dog&#34; book.  The novel is told from the perspective of the dog.  I have often wondered how a dog thinks. This story tells the story of this dog and his family brillilantly!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|So John-boy moved to Montana to get his head together?  Time will tell if that helped him with his bad-boy rep with the ladies but it definitely helped his music which was NEVER a problem!!!  :)  I love how he reinvents himself, never boring, always fresh.  I heard from relatives that his shows are not to be missed.  One day...
B004OC07F8|5.0|I love this book - one of my favorites. Read it a long time ago when it was published. Wanted to keep an electronic copy in y library.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|When you download this game you at e getting the most enjoyable bingo game around.  It is very easy to make every night a Bingo Blitz nite.
B008JFUPZI|4.0|My grandson and I both loved this movie. Plenty of action, monsters and loved Jeff Bridges roll in this movie! Will definitely buy the movie once it's released.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This film at points was hard for me to watch, but no one can deny the quality of the acting and the story line.  Everyone was just amazing, it is not to be missed.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|This waste of how ever many minutes of your life is just awful.  John Travolta is really not that great of an actor, certainly not good enough to pull of the \\"European\\" accent he is trying to pull off.<br />The plot spirals into idiocracy as the two fight and get the one up on each other.<br />Don't waste your time.<br />Bad acting, bad plot and well just bad everything.<br />I think I will stop wasting my time on new Robert De Niro movies, because he has been turning out some real tankers lately.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Very nicely done by all.....Kurt Russell was wonderful, as was Sam Elliott, by I really was thrilled with<br />the performance of Val Kilmer...<br />This was an outstanding film
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|Fast version ... if you are a fan of TPOTO (as I admit I am) ... this really is a must watch / own.<br /><br />Production quality is on par with any other live production Blu-ray to date.<br /><br />The extra insights into this beloved musical are TOTALLY worth enjoying this more than once.<br /><br />GET IT ALREADY!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Solid action with a stellar cast; Joss Whedon does a great job bringing the story to screen. Can't wait for the next one.
B009GED3HS|3.0|I cannot wait for season 9. Wish Amazon would support Android devices though! What century do we live in? Get busy with an Android app and Ill give 5 stars!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Really enjoyed this one.  His old army buddies work well together. Great action, great villains, great story!  The numbers add up in this one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played. I will play this game forevermore. Bestest game in the world.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This I have to say is about the best album that Rod has made, he's still up there with the best, moving with the times and this album is so different to any he has done before - a bit of a discreet Scottish undertone (very clever) and one that I find myself playing over and over. Each song has a definite message and by god it comes across. Listening to this music, you get the innermost feelings from Rod's heart - after all, there comes a time in all our lives when you really \\"get\\" what \\"life\\" is all about and appreciate just how precious life is and that it's running out and it makes you reflect on what you have actually experienced through life and this album says it all for Rod - I think!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just can't stop playing. Try it and you will love it to. Fun fun fun. Just love this app. Feels just like the original.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the whole series. They were all quick and easy reads, yet makes the reader question ideals and morals and what is right and wrong in war.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I didn't like the beginning, seemed slow and did not hold my interest---however, I'm glad I continued because the story picked up and became extremely interesting. I really enjoyed the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the whole series. They were all quick and easy reads, yet makes the reader question ideals and morals and what is right and wrong in war.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|My son just downloaded this game and it is costing me a fortune with buying the tokens. They should not be this expensive!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. So much so that I had to read the whole series right away. They are all quick and easy reads, but I feel like I could read them all over and over again. I like how it really makes you think about what is right and wrong, and understand this is not always so clear in war. I would recommend this series to anyone who wants and action and drama filled story that also makes them think further.
030758836X|2.0|The first 90% of this book enraptured me....the two characters' brutal observations about human foibles and motivations were equal parts creepy, fascinating and cringe inducing in the &#34; that is sooo true&#34; kind of way...they captured the ickiness of our inner thought life perfectly.<br />The drawing of the portrait of the mind of a sociopath was also fantastic and the mystery was certainly a slow, delicious burn...and then...cold water was thrown on the story when it should have been drawn to a satisfying conclusion.<br />That's what this novel glaringly lacks...satisfaction. There is no one to root for, we start rooting for Amy only to turn against her after the &#34; twist&#34; which you could see coming a mile off, then we start to root for Nick only to be hit with the wildly implausible and anti climatic ending. Ms. Flynn seems to have forgotten one basic rule of character development....the audience will become isolated if there's nothing to identify with.<br />I get the idea that the two characters become so consumed with their &#34; sickness&#34; in the end that they make their decisions accordingly....but the decision, especially Nicks, just doesn't...fit. Any fan of mystery, or any basic procedural on TV right now could come up with a hundred ways for the truth to be discovered, and Ms. Flynn leaves this glaringly unaddressed and the end effect is that it feels like a massive, lazy cop out.<br />Great read until the end, or even two thirds of the way through but wildly unsatisying at the end of the day.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Visually pretty cool but very predictable, blatently copying scenes from a number of sci-fi films. I couldn't help but laugh at the bad acting a few times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series! Even my preteen enjoys it and I like that it's historical fiction, so somewhat of a learning experience. Picture quality and audio/visual syncing are excellent.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|... has similar scenes to Baraka but you can't beat Ron Fricke for creating visually stunning, thoughtful masterpieces on film. I believe this one took him over a decade to produce?
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I have most of his cd's and have seen him in person. However this I bought without hearing any of it and its awful. Not his fault but I don't care for any of the songs on this Cd at all. Very disappointed.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It is so nice to watch without commercials.  All cast members do a great job. I atchd the whole season in one sitting.
B005PK553C|4.0|The show is quite interesting so far, a bit gory, but that's what makes it interesting. I can't wait to find out what happens next!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story is wonderful. I adore Gideon & Ava. I also love Cary<br /> I would follow this story until their much deserved happy ending. So please keep it coming....
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased this to use on an iPad 3. My wife has an iPad 2 ... and it works equally well on both models. I've used it with SD cards from my Nikon cameras (several DSLR's and Coolpix models). I used the USB dongle with a Sony T90 after finding the USB setting in the camera. When set to \\"auto\\" it doesn't get acknowledged but if you set the USB setting in the camera to \\"Mass storage\\" it recognized the card/camera and allowed you to upload the pictures and videos.<br /><br />So far the one exception I've found is when trying to use a USB card from a Canon Vixia HF200 camcorder. In this case it doesn't acknowledge the card or anything on it. I've tried several SD cards but if formated and used with the camera ... it doesn't seem to be able to read it from the Vixia. There might be a work around but as of this time I can't find it or reference to this issue online. No joy using the USB connection with the Vixia, no matter what the USB setting is on the camera.<br /><br />Another problem I've found is in using either of the two USB dongles I have for reading Sony Memory Cards. When pluging those into the USB dongle ... it gives you an error reading that the device requires too much power to read. I'm guessing the USB dongle requires a powered camera or device to be able to function. Just a guess on my part but so far it's useless for using Sony card readers on the USB dongle.<br /><br />I read of someone complaining about the fit of the dongle to the unit and fear of breaking it off. Well, this isn't designed to be carried around in the slot. You should only be using this connected while you are sitting with it some place secure ... desk or table top and remove it once you've transfered your pictures. To me this is a non issue. It works well with the cover I use but I can see where if your cover ONLY is open large enough for the normal power cord ... you might have an issue.<br /><br />If it allowed you to download from the iPad to the card it would be a nice feature butagain I only got this to be able to upload and view on my iPad. Nicer to see your pictures for review quickly and on a larger screen. I'd not use this as a way to off load and store pictures on a trip other than a back up to the SD card. SD cards are so cheap now it's a lot easier to carry extra SD cards rather than lugging an iPad for back up for my way of doing things.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|This was a very well written story about damaged people. The two young men, that played the boys in this movie, did one heck of a job with their parts. It was nice to see Reese Witherspoon depart from her normal roles.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app used to be awesome. Since the &quot;upgrade&quot; it now has an &quot;ongoing&quot; status which is annoying. It is not user friendly at all; doesn't allow much user input. Most importantly however, I've been sitting in a thunderstorm with a severe thunderstorm warning for the last 45 minutes. I never got a notification although it is set to do that. AND it says the current conditions are 93 degrees, mostly sunny, and dry conditions will continue. It's actually 73 and very rainy. App won't reftesh automatically nor manually. I will be removing this app from my device as soon as I type a period at the end of this sentence.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this on my Kindle and phone. I can highlight and bookmarks. Listen to it read to me and I can chance the type of Bible to whichever versen is easyer to understand for me. I so recommend this app. It helps you so much with being closer to God.
B004PJG7MW|5.0|Great movie! Showed grandkids told them this movie reminded me of the movie Wall-e. They laughed and thought it was a good movie
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love how you can advance easily wish energy wouldn't run out though so you could play more than just allowed I like slot of hidden search games and this is among my favorites
0743490304|1.0|I always order a &#34;like new&#34; condition book.  This one was well used, yellowed pages, strange plastic cover over the book jacket, so I am disappointed with this purchase.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Powerful. Heart breaking. This novel places you in difficult shoes of both the main characters. It will change your perspective on life and how you go about living it.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|These actors must be, should be, embarrassed by their performances in this picture. Lee and Goodman really phoned it in this time.
B0035JGYZS|5.0|This movie is real original ..it jeep you entertained and the especial effects are extraordinary..best of all the series..I gave a five stars good performances also.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Right in line with excellent Disney storytelling!  Intricate and substantive plot, that explores an exciting &#34;what-if&#34; fantasy of a human hero on Mars.  Cinematography and graphics are awesome!  Definitely requires a sequel!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I really like this show, its clever and entertaining.  I did not go to Harvard School, so I will never know if it is easy to &#34;fake&#34; or pretend that someone graduated from Harvard, when in fact the main character graduated from the school of life. In my opinion the episodes are better written than the first season
B000LTAY1U|3.0|It's OK.  The day of the week is a little off, but I guess I can live with it being that way.
B000I9W08I|1.0|I am sure there are plenty of good things on this movie, but I got really bored within the first 20 minutes so I did not watch the rest of the movie.
0399255370|5.0|The book is so cute! Some of the &#34;complaints&#34; made by the crayons are so funny and the ending is terrific!! Will continue to buy until all my friend's children have this book on their shelf!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|AWSOME<br />Very cool game I love it I'm in second place on my lead board and the minions are rediculous
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was running my battery down quickly and it was taking all night to charge.  This solved my problem.  Thank you, Amazon
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I played several levels and  could not put it down.  It was very challenging and kept my mind working.  This game would be great for kids.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Not a mindless matching game.  It keeps you engaged and thinking outside the box.  Love the challenge and the response from the game.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book is better than I thought it would be. In fact much better! I'm 11 and this book was perfect for me and my reading level. I can't wait to read the next book in this series!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I dont give many five star reviews or take the time to write one at all; but this book is fantastic! I couldn't put it down. The writing is flawless, it sucks you right in. I can't wait to read the rest of her books. A definite &#34;must read!&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun that's it it's just fun what's left to say it's one of those must get games that u have the try to believe
B009AY04A8|4.0|This hidden object games as nice bright colors and is fun to play. It seems to be a little sensitive on random tapping penalty,which is annoying. It's just an average game nothing spectacular and nothing bad. Just average.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's rare for me to be genuinely surprised by the outcome of a mystery. So this book was especially delicious in its unpredictability. Very well written and truly hard to put down--take that as a warning if you have to work for a living! A welcome escape from my usual diet of non-fiction.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Just like the original Angry Birds but with a different levels and different animals to knock down. If you enjoyed Angry Birds you'll enjoy this as well
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Another great Harry Hole mystery with plenty of twists and turns. Definitely leaves you wanting the next one. The best mystery series out there.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so addicting and simple to learn. You end up playing it for hours trying to beat your high score over and over again.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I love good Sci-Fi movies and this is one of them! Excellent Sci-Fi movies are hard to find, actually. Especially these days! I did read the other reviews complaining about how this movie was a compilation of some many other classic (and not-so-classic) Sci-Fi movies already done. So what? It was done well, that's what counts! The movie was beautiful to watch, the plot was intriguing, the music was awesome. (Especially if you have surround sound!) Those three add up to a five star rating right there. Add in Tom Cruise who 9 outa 10 times somehow doesn't fail to put out an amazing film (I just don't know how he does it, but he simply puts out &#34;Good Film' over & over! TYVM Tom Cruise!) If you love Sci-Fi movies for Sci-Fi movie's sake, the see this movie. If you plan to nit-pic, then maybe this movie is not for you. Plan on a beautiful ride, though. 'Thumbs up'.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Got this because I enjoyed the other Tempe Run games so much. Don't like this one as well as those. The backgrounds are really well done and thought out, but I find this one more difficult then the others and sometimes on my Kindle Fire it lags and I'll trip and have to start over again
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hussein's third book, \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" starts off quite fine in describing life in Afghanistan and setting up the tale. Unfortunately when Hosseini strays outside the geography of Afghanistan, his prose gets bogged down and he can't quite capture the essence of relationships he tries to describe. Only when he brings the story back full circle at the end does he come back to his strengths.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Can't stop playing this game. Fun and a good thing to do when bored. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that some items that you have to get to complete missions requires you to pay actual money if you don't have any of the game cash left.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some things are very easy to figure out and others are harder. Sometimes walking away from it and coming back helps find the hard stuff.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and it didn't work at all. Had to delete it. Was very disappointed because Uno is one of my favorite card games
B008JGSM6G|5.0|once you start you can't stop playing , is one of the best and challenging games I have ever played.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|This is my third or fourth time ready Dune.  There are s many interwoven plots that it is still challenging to follow them all.  The Dune series is one of my favorite series of scify books.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this as a Free App of the Day. Love it! Use it nearly every day. It's a great way to block out extraneous noise and annoyances.
0425263924|5.0|If only I could find a man like Gideon!!  Actually, I think that is a dream for a lot of women!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Through reading this series I never did feel that Sookie so warm and alive belonged to the vampires. She's part fairy and that makes her alive and full of nature and it ultimately makes her stronger than they. Being with Sam who is a wild thing so close to life and nature too has always made more sense. I really liked this book, and despite all the negative reviews I'm glad to have read it, and love the way she ended the series.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Excellent writing; pure Grisham; gives us more. All stories held my interest left me wanting more. Graet book, great reading
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|I caught this concert on PBS and was determined to buy it.  The Bee Gees will forever be one of my top 5 favorite groups.  I grew up with their music and now, a few decades later, continue to be moved by their music and lyrics.
B007P6VM04|3.0|Simply put, this CD is a bit incomplete as far as the shows content, BUT still enjoyable.  In hindsight I think I would have been happier just searching out my favorites for purchase from iTunes.  Really disappointed that the show was cancelled :(
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The name made me not watch it for a long time. But it was not what the name implied. Now I wish I watched it earlier!
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|Enjoy each character.  Each character is well developed and you find yourself routing for them and wanting to know more about them.  You also see the bond developing slowly among the cast and how they are evolving into a family.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Well done remake of the Stalone classic. I like the action and story line. Good character development for a shoot em up movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Super fun.. I'm addicted to hidden object games.. and love it more with tasks to complete.. cant wait to reach the high levels ive been reading about
B0042X9L6A|5.0|i love.... in fact, i'm in love with this flash, it is my first one.<br />simply, pictures with this flash it's a whole deferent level.<br />i recommend this for every one even the amateur photographers, it will blow your mind, plus it's super easy to use, will never shoot without it again, even if i don't have to :)
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|We bought this game yesterday and everytime we get to the part of fixing the chair, the game freezes and closes.  My son loves these games but this one is impossible to get him to play because of the issue.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Great story line. Unfortunately, to me way too many hidden object games. It took away from the adventure. Even providing two items per hog there were still a great many things. I prefer more puzzles and less hogs. The story piqued my interest and look forward to the end. I wished the doll house allowed you to revisit the dolls scenes so your can play them over again because they were interesting to watch.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I reccomend this book, because show u a lot stuffs that u thing it doesnt exist and that not so easy
B00CL50LEC|2.0|If you are looking for the quintessential teen romance, fight the man, zombie apocalypse, love wins over all.....then this is your movie.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This app is amazing and I love the updated but there is still a few problems one,it takes a while to get the page up,two, the prices are a little too expensive,and three,the game takes too long to load
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Pretty good game. Enjoying so far. Graphics are cool. You get a lot of rewards in the game but not energy. But keeps me occupied
B00D2K40WY|2.0|Ok so I took my kindle to school and there are no games allowed in my school so I tapped remove from carousel, and let me tell you this, I HAD THE FULL VERSION! So after school I tapped play. I only got the free version and ALL the stuff I paid for was gone! Honestly it's very frustrating. Please fix this immediately
B001TH16DI|5.0|Sinve I now have a big screen LED, watching these movies is a dream. With a new sound system they are awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I LOVE this puzzle game! It's very challenging, strategic, great graphics, and 3-dimensional. It was difficult at first, but you'll eventually figure it out. It's not as hard, once you get the hang of it. And what I love about playing it is its like solving a mystery. Each room level is different. I highly recommend this game to everyone who is searching for a clue game. It's fun and addictive!!!
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|I totally loooved this book - one of the best ones I read this summer and I bought 2 more books written by the same author. The writing style, the human kind side of the characters and the storyline, I loved it all.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|It is a good game but we need more than 15 min. Who made this game anyway it sucks. This
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Second book was the best - first was fun third was OK more of a love story -all in all the books were fun summer read
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I had a problem with the movie as we tried to watch so we went bacvk out to try again and we were charged for the movie twice.  Unlike normal product amazon orders I just can't find a place to request refund for orders of videos.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I liked this book a lot. Twisted and turned to the very end. I recommend this book as a good read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful characters and beautiful set and costumes.  I can't wait to watch more episodes and learn more about each player.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|I can understand the idea of the plot but can't get over the use of guns in martial arts. It makes the movie seem silly and hard to take seriously. If the use of waving back and forth of guns was taken out I would have probably enjoyed it more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Would recommend this game.  Great game to relax and enjoy. This game was easy to navigate and loading time was easy.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|I love fall out boy's style and sound, but I don't like the amount of bad language on this album. None of the songs were marked explicit, but many of them include quite a bit of bad language. I can listen to about 5 out of the 11 songs on this album without being turned off, so I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for it.
B002SJIO5E|3.0|Borrowed from our local library so it there was no cost to me. It isn't academy award level, it is a movie/video just for the sake of being one. While the plot line is pretty predictable, you do get drawn into it if for no other reason but to find out what happens next. There are some heroes plus villains galore with lots of blood and gore - hit a nasty with an alien weapon round and the last you see of him is a big splatter. Would I watch a sequel to see what happens to the hero - sure, why not
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very Useful tool, I don't have to waste money in buying new knifes. Just with a minute your knife is like new.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|I'm hoping LEGO will issue other movies of this quality.  While it is true that the shorts are based on console game, they are NOT the same.  I have the XBox version and there are 2 notable differences.  First, the quality of the video is much inferior in the game.  Second, the video game version of the scenes usually end with a different situation where the player is then faced to complete a task, whereas the movie is nice flowing in its narrative.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of what LEGO did here and I highly recommend this movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You will not be disappointed! One of the best books I have read in years. It's the kind of story that is easy to read and pushes you to read just one more chapter- until you realize it's midnight and you've been at it for 8 hours. I am moving on to \\"Shift\\" from here. Can't wait. Great read, great price- what are you waiting for?!?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books. I would recommend this to any class, or school. Very cool and sad book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love these books I can read them over and over and never get tired of them... I recommend to everybody to read!!!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I am glad I bought it. I watch it with my girl friend and we both laughed during the whole movie.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It's a lot better than any of the other games that are made like it and u don't have to wait to long for things to be ready
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I like checkers and this program fits my Fire.  Easy to use and no need to find another player.  The board is on the Fire.
B007N8RULO|5.0|for some reason, I am able to get lower scores when playing this game on the computer, as opposed to the Kindle.  I still love the game and keep trying to lower my score.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, lots of action!  Watching Thor helped me understand the Avengers movie.  I am eager for the sequel to be released.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I didn't realize what this was &#34;with friends&#34;, so I have not played it -- I installed regular UNO instead, and I enjoy that version.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I love it too.  My new favorite movie only after Django  dance  was great should have been a 10, only if you can't dance
B004SUWR2C|5.0|When you get a plus 4 wild card I am never sure whether to challenge or not -- what is it that makes the challenge successful as opposed to failing and having to take 6 cards!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Best Freakin' movie EVER!!!!!!  They want more words  watch this movie  you will love it too  BLOOD  and revenge  and rockin'  i have watched this movie many times and i never do that.  Jamie Foxx  gives riveting performance  but The Dentist/bounty hunter......I quote him!
B004D1CK32|5.0|You will enjoy this whether you enjoy samurai movies or not.  The western, The Magnificent Seven, was based on this movie.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|As an educator I think this is a great book for teachers to read as a new school year begins.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great Read!!! Really enjoyed the books!! Would recommend, even if you already seen the first movie.. I can't wait to see how they make the rest of the movies!
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Love stories about the old Gods. This updated version is great. You have a cast of awesome actors that make the story come alive. One of my favorite fantasy movies. Yes, I've seen the original one, but it's the special effects of today that makes fantasy movies more enjoyable to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to waste time and its soooooo fun<br /><br />I have nothing else to say about this fun addictive game of epicness
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|My 3 favorite series are Harry Potter, Twilight, and mortal instruments!  I love the characters and the story!  Couldn't put the first three books down.  Anxious for the last book to come out!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game so far! It is very entertaining and addicting. I highly recommend it for all horse lover's lik
B005UDD1R6|3.0|The only thing is a missing feature. When turned off it starts the mp3 over again. There should be a memory function
1607066017|1.0|The comic got such high rating on Amazon so I borrowed it from the liberay, and it bored me to death.  Other review said it is hilarious.  Nope.  Just plain boring and bad.<br /><br />The story starts with Alana and Marco, lovers from the opposite warring nations, running away from their armies and having a baby together.  The comic follows their journdy.<br /><br />The story moves very slow and is predictable.  And the story line is flat.  During their escape, they met various characters and chased by bounty hunters.  It is like, after the first two pages of each chapter you can pretty much know the story for the rest of the chapter.  They were trying to find out Alna, and she red romance book that you get from supermarket, with humans on the cover.  Uhh... why would sci-fi story have supermarket and worlds with no human has humans on some romance cover?<br /><br />The whole thing is just like a really terrible sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I can be a nasty reviewer and I thought hard about bad things to say about this book.<br /><br />- A thriller is two or more protagonists competing for a goal. Lee Child failed to convince me that a missing flash drive was worth getting excited over.<br /><br />- Jack Reacher is so incredibly superhuman, I'm surprised he can't walk on water.<br /><br />- The paucity of dialog tags means that you will frequently need to back up to see who is speaking.<br /><br />Otherwise, this book is perfect. It's my first Lee Child. I spent half an hour going through my bookcase (I love owning books I can touch and kill cockroaches with) to make sure it's no exaggeration to say that this is the best thriller I've ever read.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a stereotype hard-boiled hard-bitten action hero with an exceptionally low carbon footprint. He's somewhat behind the technology curve: he doesn't own a cellphone and the average six year old is more computer literate. That's not quite enough to make him a standout and I'd have liked to see some personality idiosyncrasies. For example instead of being such a loner he could love to discuss baseball statistics with barmen, cab drivers and federal agents. Something stupid but loveable.<br /><br />Witty tough-guy dialog is expected in the modern thriller and Jack Reacher doesn't disappoint. He manages to be smartass but not ridiculous.<br /><br />Lee Child's insights into the arcane world of special forces really made me sit up. He utterly knows what he's talking about, or certainly gave that impression anyway. I'll have to resist citing him as an authority every time the subject crops up on Facebook.<br /><br />Lila Hoth is a villain like few and really deserved to reappear in future Jack Reacher stories.<br /><br />I'm used to sloppy plotting in thrillers with the US Cavalry miraculously riding in to the rescue. But in \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" there's only one tiny plot hole I could discover: in real life, every computer database is backed up at least daily. If a file is maliciously deleted then you can restore from backup or get it from a mirror site. That aside, the plotting was meticulous. I hugely appreciated the painstaking way Lee Child set up the subway surfing gag hundreds of pages in advance. Our hero slowly peels back the truth layer by layer.<br /><br />Don't take this book to bed with you. You won't get any sleep until you read the last page.least daily.

0399255370|5.0|Fantastic and creative book sure to please kids and adults alike. You will never look at crayons the same again. A must buy - it delights my 4 and 6 year old.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|The CD has great sound and came in on time when I needed it. I couldn't ask for anything else from a product.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app it is soo awesome!!!!! and it is on sale for now!! plus it is soo cuteeee
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The feel of this mouse took a bit of getting used to.  But then my previous mouse was a very cheap standard deal.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Reasonable Tom Cruise movie with good action, don't regret having rented it for a random weekend watch. Nice Werner Herzog cameo as well.
0670026638|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very log time.  The story line is engaging and I could not put it down.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|This is not a chick flick, it is a feminist movie (which makes it even better). There were so many facets relating to sexism & women's expected roles that were handled with a few succinct lines of dialogue (these few were the first to be remembered).<br />\\"This is my face, deal with it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Since when are you counting calories?\\"<br />- \\"Since I'm fat.\\" said by the stick thin 11 year old character<br /><br />\\"Why don't they show normal women in magazines?\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm a person, not an accessory.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, what does she have to be angry about?\\"<br />- \\"She's hungry.\\" about a super model who is later seen eating a napkin.<br /><br />\\"There are no 60 year old women, I'm the last one.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's time to stop talking down to our readers.\\" about the direction a women's magazine should take.<br /><br />Filled with these enlightening bon mots, this movie attempts to scale the anti feminist mountain of propaganda. Woman are not cardboard cut outs with black & white answers, we are complex & messy & capable of growing as this fabulous movie so aptly represents.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I spend hours playing this game. I'm addicted to it. Two suits is not easy, but can be won. I love this game.
B0011NVC98|5.0|5 minutes into this movie, I knew that I was going to love it. Having first read the epic poem 'Beowulf' in high school (and finding it a little boring) I didn't know how well it would translate to film. I was pleasantly surprised by all aspects including the performances given by Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie. The battle scenes are intense and director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future) deftly weaves the seduction of the warrior Beowulf by Grendal's mother played by Jolie into the story. The special effects of the monster Grendal are very state of the art and amazing. Co-written by Quentin Tarrantino's collaborator on 'Pulp Fiction' Roger Avery the script crackles and is one of the film's best aspects. This movie is a hidden gem that is two hours of rip-roaring fun!
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|She holds your interest from beginning to end. Her wit is charming and she makes you want to strive to be more like the main character Elizabeth.<br />Eloise
B004SRNH10|3.0|I'm not sure why I down loaded this but I didn't use it very often so I deleted it. I know it is useful for many things but I didn't need it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|had it on cassette but its much clearer on cd. dont have anything more to say about it other then im pleased.
B005V20JKI|3.0|This game was fun but hard to play on the phone. It may be better with updates but I dont have the game anymore.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love Yahoo Mail. It is the only mail that I use for my computer and tablets because of it's ease of use and dependability. I would recommend this to others.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This is a fun app to doodle with but that's about it. If you like to draw on your phone then your phone then you might like it.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is an excellent collection of songs. It spans most of his career with some of his best work leading up to the last few songs that he released. I would recommend this cd to others who are true Johnny Cash fans.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Love Al Pacino's work in this classic film. Bitter sweet series. Draws on raw emotion for each character. love the old classics and this one tops my list.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is an excellent app that is easy to use and designed foe the Kindle Fire HD tablet. I would recommend this to others.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really like this dictionary because it is more than just a plain old run in the mill place to look up words. I enjoy the information that I read every morning and the word games are fun and challenging.  I also like that I can look up the Word of the Day in other languages. I would recommend this dictionary app to anyone who wants more from their dictionary.
B0058VW36U|4.0|the art style is united and has admirable production value.<br /><br />the app is well polished.<br /><br />there are in-app purchases. there are screens in game asking you to by them. you can easily disable these screens.<br /><br />there are ads for related games from the same developer. you cannot disable these.<br /><br />this app hides the status bar.<br /><br />it is not clear what the app does with the phone state and identity.
0812993845|1.0|As sad as I am to have to admit this, I have to say that this was the worst book I may have ever read. The entire story line is completely ridiculous, which makes it all the more challenging to relate/enjoy the humour. Sure there are funny and witty lines etc, but when its based on a completely unrealistic and absurd plot, it really goes unnoticed. HUGE sophie kinsella fan and was counting the days until this book was released but ultimately a waste of time. Took me months to even get up the drive to read it, and it was entirely predictable to top it all off. Better luck next time!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I generally enjoy the building games, but with Oregon Trail, I despise that you can only perform a handful of actions at a time. If you want to perform more than a few actions, you have to purchase more energy for actions (actual money that comes to about a dollar an action) or wait an extended period of time to power back up. It's a ripoff. Save your money and find a game that you only pay for once.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a good read that is relentlessly intense and completely possible.  Enjoyed it  immensely. A tough place to survive...take notes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No bad words, no killings, no gore for gore's sake.  Excellent series.  I'd love to wee more like it. great!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three continues the saga although the first 2 episodes do not really move the plot along. N<br />Bates is still in prison and the abbey is still in jeopardy
B00114RKT8|4.0|This movie is inspiring from the beginning to the end. However, something raises question because, I think, there are not many times when the protagonist is seeking God's divine intervention. He rather seeks guidance from others. Overall, this movie was interesting and worth every penny to watch.
B00EOO55GW|3.0|More classic hard rock orientated than past work. Solid effort. More consistent than &#34;Nightmare&#34; but missing the powerful MP on drums!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|If you watched this move for the second time or more, it's because you love the franchise. J.J. Abrams created a perfect blend of action and nostalgia. Testosterone saturation aside, the movie was beautifully played by a young, ensemble of actors.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Incredible recording which harkens back to their early days. Ozzy sounds fresh, while guitar & bass gods, Iommi & Butler rule as always!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Coolest game ever so exited for the next update if you're looking for a pass of time i would recommend this app
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The movie is epic, Thought provoking, beautiful scenery, wicked drones. This movie is comparable to what's happening today with the wars over oil in the middle east. Sit back, grab your drink, and enjoy!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We have been watching the Britsh comedies for years on PBS. Just love that I can get most of them on my Kindle and watching it in HD it is unbelieveable how great the picture is.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST CALCULATOR ON ANY DEVICE<br />IT'S BACK TO BASIC AND SOMETIMES THAT IS WHAT'S NEEDED!!!<br /><br />LOVE IT AND USE IT FOR EVERYTHING!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|everything about this movie was amazing .the acting the singing but most of all gods mercy and lo9ve for people and how a life can be changed and used by him thru love and commitment
B0037Z8SLI|4.0|Who would have thought the importance and benefits of checklists!<br />Medical<br />Airline<br />Architeciture/ building<br />Finance.<br />This book covers the above.<br />How can you improve your business with a checklist?
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I chose this book because it fascinated me the way people would write books about history and make it so interesting!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Magical story that  is rich in intrigue. Depth of characters lets you know their intimate thoughts. An exhilarating, exciting, consistently engaging adventure story. Superbly written.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Even though I only have the trial version it is great for learning the strategy to take for certain types of decks.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|In the beginning it is really easy but it starts to get very challenging. It is a great app considering it.is free. I definitely recommend it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love Flow but sometimes  I hate it when I can't finger out how to solve the leave and I have to ask my 6 yr. Old sister who is so good at it!<br />Bye it best game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Found myself reading too fast to find out &#34;what happens next?&#34; Good story that kept my interest in each character.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The name bar all u have to do is press go not tap off type just press go on kindle and my name is epicunicorn57 if u see me plz friend me and I not sure how to live chat with people I think u have to put on ear phones or buds
B007QSNMS6|5.0|Inspiring, practical and well-written with a killer case that no advertising professional can or should ignore.<br /><br />Well done guys!<br /><br />Christian, Denmark
B007TNS6JI|3.0|The game is great but causes many irritations. For example, when I first started the mission, I tried playing and it was going alright. Then when wave 3 spawns, about one or two warrior is glitched to where the enemy is there but you can see them or kill them and they don't move. It doesn't seem like a common problem but beware of this.<br /><br />Next issue is that the game always deletes your data so you have to restart all over. Sometimes it will just glitch your character to where you need to delete your person and make a new one. This can be very annoying.<br /><br />Another note is that the controls are kind of awkward. It's hard to get the hangs of things at first but eventually you will get used to it.<br /><br />Now I refuse to rate this a one despite what others are doing because I read their comments and they said it was a great game. I will admit, if they can fix these bugs then this game will be amazing but otherwise, it is just upsetting to restart all over. I rate this a three because the game is great overall. The fighting style, choice of armor/equipment and weapons/ different maps/ online play/etc. The company is also a company I trust. I won't rate it a 4 because it needs works but unlike most people who give one complaint and give the rating a one because of that issue while stating the game is great, this game is great. A great game doesn't need to be rated so low so that's why three is my choice. It balances the good and the bad out. It's a great game but still needs work which would be hard to take care of.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Warning: this film may produce a strong desire to drop your current life and take to the snow. And that's beautiful.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I love this book was the best one I ever read I loved it I would recommend it for people who really like to read.: -)
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is not too difficult, but it is fun.  You have many levels and ifyou dont want to do all the reading before each level, just tap throught it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first book, The Hunger Games, was definitely Suzanne Collins best book.  It was fresh and original.  However, it's been downhill from there.
B00CJGP116|5.0|This is one of Marc Anthony best Cd. It is really great, I love all the songs that he sing. Awesome CD.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|When I rented the film I had no idea what the film was about only that Steven Sodeburg (excuse my spelling) was the director, so I knew it would probably be good, and it didn't disappoint.  Full of twists and turns and you had no idea where the film was going.  Jude Law was great as was Rooney Mara, and I have to say a real eye opener to others about the drug industry and how people are led down the yellow brick road to disaster with pharmaceuticals.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I'm buying copies for all of my friends...this book is too good not to share. Read it today, you won't regret it.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|From a long time fan of A7X, this album is amazing, albeit not as heavy as some of their other work, but amazing all the same.
B0037VNX44|3.0|Tom Hardy was good in this role, however the synopsis of this movie led me to believe the story had more meat in it that it did. I was truly disappointed in the movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the performance as I love Tom Hardy, just wish that the movie held true to the discription given.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Hands down the best book I have ever read, and I cannot WAIT to read the rest of the series!!
B000U6BT40|4.0|I am undecided about this show. I will probably watch more episodes before I make up my mind. This first one was wild but I am not sure how it can continue at that pace without becoming too ridiculous. I like the main idea of a town like Eureka because I am a geek myself. Will just have to watch some more.
B009AY04A8|5.0|BEtter than most Hidden Object games, couldn't stop playing until I finished the game, can't wait for Pirate Adventures 2, not only hidden objects but puzzles, etc. which made the game even more FUN.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good read and great characters......great turn in the story!!  Easy to read and kept me interested. Starts slow but really hooks you part way in
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved Hunger Games, and Catching Fire was good, too.<br />But, once I was reaching the end, I couldn't wait to be finished, and on to something else.<br />Still, a great story!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|One of those books that makes you a better person,makes you revisit your views and change you forever.<br />Amazing!<br />Highly recommend ,especially for a teenagers for a personal growths.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is one of my favorite bingo games. I love the different places and announcers, the high stakes bingos have great payouts and I have my fair share of wins. This is one bingo game that I tell people about! Fun,fun,fun!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another great read from Lee Child. The world of Reacher is never dull, and I can't wait to read the final chapter of this three part story.
B00D9PUXQY|1.0|I have been a hard core DevilDriver fan since the first record, their first two albums are classics in my book. The third one was even headed in a pretty cool direction ...., not as grooving as I would like but it was really technical and heavy<br /> Then came pray for villains, and beast and whether I'm in the minority or not, those albums bore the hell out of me in recent interviews they were saying that they're going back there roots .... that couldn't be further from the truth this album is just like the last 2<br />Boring, thats really the only way to describe this cd. No songs stick out, no riffs grab you, they are once again going through the motions with no inspiration whatsoever!<br />If you liked the last 2 records this album might hold your intrest , but if your like me and didn't care much for them this isn't any better, same old filler, sa,me old uninspired song writing and over the top vocals.<br /><br />Never seen a band get better technically but loose song writing capabilites simultaneously.<br /><br />0/5
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good  together.  I've always liked movies with Tommy Lee.  Humor is inserted at the appropriate times and the action keeps you interested.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Excellent book to read if u r on or thinking about using the Atkins diet to lose weight. Great reading, definitely worth the Monet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best show on television bar none, and probably the best one on amazon as well. Five stars without a doubt
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Blackmore's Night continues to amaze me with their creativity in creating alluring and mesmerizing music to the ears.  Both Ritchie Blackmore and Candice Night deserve most of the credit but also the rest of the group and their Engineer in the mixing room.<br /><br />Great album, great music.  With both Ronnie James Dio and John Lord now gone from this Earth, Ritchie has paid homage to his former band mates with &#34;Temple of the King&#34; and &#34;Ode to John&#34;.<br /><br />Thanks Ritchie,<br /><br />Gil
B0000041DF|5.0|I stumbled across Ms Arberich's artistry on Youtube and decided I wanted some higher quality examples of her mastery.  I have been very pleased with this CD.  It arrived in superb condition and reasonably quickly.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book illustrates several ways in which either real or perceived nuggets of information can alter lives.  One character dwells on the what-ifs surrounding the long-ago death of her teenage daughter and lets this obsession block all enjoyment from her life.  One married couple falls prey to the what-ifs of alternate partners, both ignoring the affect this might have on their child.  Another couple must come to terms with a long-held secret that, when known, alters every aspect of their family and relationship.<br /><br />Set in Australia, the characters are easily relatable.
B000001GQQ|5.0|Martha is amazing.  I really suggest her works for anyone who loves piano played superbly.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|An excellent introduction the writer's work and also some fine retouches for old fans such as myself. A page and stomach turner, chapeau, Maitre!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|As usual Lee Child delivers another great story.  Read it over the weekend...could not put it down until I was finished
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Exciting, amazing, hilarious, clever! Can't get enough of this Doctor & all the silly antics! I will keep watching over & over & over again! Love it!!
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Cannot go wrong with purchasing this disc.  Get the CD as well.  Dave Grohl knows how to put together a quality product
B00CLD65X0|4.0|It was disappointing to have the season end with episodes which seemed to insert current social issues and thinking into the past where they were quite out of place.  If this trend of rewriting history continues in the series, it will not be worth watching.  There is enough politically correct social indoctrination to be found elsewhere.  It was refreshing to watch a series with good character development without the unwanted social commentary.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The whole series from city of bones is fantastic! She created a world filled with characters that makes for great reading.  It's engaging and I find myself attached to the characters.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Great album! I loved it! The whole album has a very positive vibe to it that I really like. Keep up the good work BSB!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|When our son told me he was playing a game where sharks ate people I was appalled...then I tried the game and it is pretty entertaining to hear them &#34;aargh&#34; or scream.  It is harder than it looks especially if you wander from plentiful food pockets. All I all it is fun!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This was so much fun! I family enjoyed it and then went to see Red 2. Great! Hope there's going to be another one.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I love using TuneIn Radio to listen to stations that I'm used to from back home. I especially like the fact that I got the Pro version free from Amazon. It adds the functionality of being able to record what you're listening to. Honestly, I haven't had much use for the recording function but it seems nice to have just in case.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love this series, but this was a little dragged out! Looking forward to Season 4. I hope its as amazing as the rest have been.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Gripping, and engaging through to finish. A read I always enjoy revisiting. Excellent piece of science fiction literature unlike any other.
B00432QAKK|5.0|Married with Children was probably the funniest condey ever , Al and Jefferson ,Peg and MArcy are just so funny.
1476734941|5.0|This may sound simplistic, but I loved the pictures of the meals. I copied them exactly, making it easy for myself. The fasting 2-3 days per week works. I have been losing 1 to 1.5 lbs per week consistantly.<br /><br />I do recommend prunes though....<br /><br />Combining this way of eating with avoiding crap foods on the regular days in the way to go.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Big Bang is a great series and to have the DVD's is so I can watch them over and over,
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master works good on my Kindle with no issues. Helps also remove files after uninstalling apps, which is a plus since we can't add more memory to our Kindles.
B00DW5IM9Q|3.0|Like ice-like fire, Bob Dylan still attracts attention. I remember being among the tie-dyed congregation on The Isle of Wight at the end of August 1969 to see him in flame; as I remember the fire in Paris that engulfed the bank known as the Credit Lyonnais. In photographs of the time provided as part of this attractive package Dylan looks as soft and innocent as old Bradley Manning before he died recently and was so swiftly born again.<br /><br />It brings back memories to actually buy an album. These days there really is no need to pay. Do I devalue this package by pulling on the acetate seal and losing the lovat blue label that says \\"2 Disc Set Features 35 Rarities and Previously Unreleased Recordings from Historic 1969-1971 era\\"? Do I devalue this presentation by playing it?  Such concerns are uppermost in the mind of those who, like me, bought the first three Dylan LPs; fortunately in mono. The music, so easy to download for free, perhaps I should leave it as it is?<br /><br />The archival little booklet says that my original \\"double album\\" was released in June 1970. I would have been one of the first to buy it. According to Wikipedia, Dylan had, at around that time, realised that his manager, Albert Grossman was taking 50% of all his song-writing royalties and Dylan was only able to cancel the contractual arrangements in July 1970.  This is evidence enough that Bob, turning on Grossman, determined not to write anything more that might give the man, to whom he owed the most,  another cent. \\"All the Tired Horses\\" and \\"Wigwam\\" to say nothing of \\"Woogie Boogie\\" must have broken poor Albert's heart. Dylan was thinking about money for a change. For this ingratitude we know, with hindsight, that the muse withdrew from her favourite and punished Dylan sorely. There have been some sublime isolated songs when the muse herself must have felt forlorn and took him once more by the hand; but since 1967 there has been nothing to match the quality of the unbroken string of albums that had gone before. Self Portrait was an attempt to assault CBS and deprive Grossman of any commission.<br /><br />Despite this the album was a success. My CD booklet opens with a copy of a CBS poster boasting that this album would be in a million homes. It went on to sell three million copies.  Dylan could do no wrong even towards Grossman.<br /><br />Between \\"John Wesley Harding\\" in 1967 and \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" 1975 was a long time; for those who'd come to expect a groundbreaking piece of work every year since \\"Freewheeling\\".  \\"Nashville Skyline\\" had been given its \\"world premiere\\" on Radio Luxembourg with Kid Jensen, aged about six, introducing \\"I Threw It All Away\\"; and over two days I taped the four tracks they showcased. The next highlight in 1969 was the arrival of \\"Don't Look Back\\" in the UK.  Lying on a mattress, I saw the film projected onto a sheet pinned to the wall of the Drury Lane Arts Lab. I was there at The Isle of Wight at the end of August 1969. If you are prepared to pay £75, as an extra you can have the whole of this concert, albeit in the wrong order, for the first time; plus the original Self Portrait \\"remastered\\". Yamaha used to sell their exquisite guitars to young people but now only successful dentists purchase them. It is these, navigators of the root canal rather than Paths of Victory, who are targeted by \\"collector's items\\". Fools and innocents like Dylan, and their money, are soon parted..<br /><br />The new album is interesting and reminds me of what I was playing 44 years ago but the only track I want to play over and over again is \\"Thirsty Boots\\" written by Eric Andersen; but the version I'm playing is that with 7104 views (as I write) on YouTube which, with its piano accompaniment, has the edge. I guess Dylan was trying to say from a sincere heart: that he was not the only song-writer in the world.<br /><br />With hindsight the highlight of that warm, famous and dark August evening when Dylan played at the Isle of Wight was the crowd calling out the word \\"DOCTOR!\\" to Ricky Farr.  Farr had been our master of ceremonies for the three days, who usually caught the attention of us all assembled there with the word \\"People!\\" After Dylan's execrable performance: \\"People ! He really has gone!\\" was the last thing we heard before that whole wasteland was aflame and we made our way from the fire to the ferries. There had been a good-natured wait of three hours after The Band's set before Dylan appeared. Not far from me (I'm sure that every person there with a memory like mine would remember it this way, \\"not far from me\\") a girl was stricken with appendicitis and a few of her desperate companions, and those nearby, started calling out for a doctor.  In that morass there were no mobile phones.  It was too dark for smoke signals.  In the end the whole crowd called out the word until, for Mr Farr, the penny dropped and with uncharacteristic insight he asked only those near the sick girl to call out.  Soon the ambulance men were on their way from Desolation Row.  Though we didn't know it then, the show was over.  Biographies of Dylan have established that the three hour wait was because Albert Grossman, also managing The Band and Richie Havens, insisted on being paid Dylan's fee £30,000 in CASH; and Ricky Farr and his associates were reduced to calling it in from the hot dog stands.<br /><br />In Paris, so long ago now, when that bank was on fire, there was an English couple who'd tired of viewing the conflagration. In that Gallic company they could speak loudly in English with no fear of being overheard. \\"Care for a spot of lunch?\\" the Englishman said.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just installed today. Spent  $5.00 for feed. Not understanding the game-part of this app.,  I also spent an additional $10.00, so I may have a (Dapple Gray) horse. Having spent $15.00 today on this...I am fearing this may have been a mistake! I hope not, especially with having paid $15.00 already!  This app. takes up a lot of space. Perhaps after I understand how to deal with this... I will love it as much as (I hope to.) The graphics are amazing; to say the Least. The (creators of this outstanding App. are SOoooo talented.)  Thank You so very much. Lastly, once I learn this App., I have a feeling I will become \\" addicted\\" to it! :-)

B00AQTY3XA|5.0|yes I would recommend it to a friend , Love it b/c it based on a true story.  awesome movie
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Definitely worth the read. Reading a book like this helps to stimulate the brain and gather ideas to improve existing businesses as well.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read American Gun and then had to read this..both amazing stories..Kyle was a great writer who captured the essence of what SEALS do..the dedication to his fellow SEALS was extraordinary...the descriptions of the ways that SEALs operate told with descriptive language and insight..I really learned a lot ...reminded me of his friend Marcus Luttrells book Lone Survivor...I would recommend to anyone who likes real life action stories..one of the best

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I wish I could play with my friends but I don't see how that happens unless they are in the game at the same time with you.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Very violent.  The phrase \\"wanton violence, blood, and gore\\" should have been attached to the movies rating.  It is robo cop drenched in blood, gore, and drugs.  Why anyone would give this 5 stars, I am not sure. Making a bloody death scene in slow mo, as though to see the beauty is sort of sick.  I am reviewing this for those who have no idea what the Dredd comic books were about.  Evidently they are about a desperate future where police officers are judge, jury, and executioner.<br />With an R rating I was expecting nudity, profanity, some violence.  This was mostly violence.  Some profanity, but not much.  There was more nudity and hardcore innuendo than profanity, but mostly it was violent.  Wish they had a V rating for obscene amounts of violence, so I would have had a bit more warning.  That said , I did watch the entire movie.  It does have a premise, story line, climax, and a fairly decent ending.  Giving this 5 stars seems unfair to other better done movies.  This is a 2.5, not a 5.  I am giving it a 2 to try to balance out the \\"cult\\" Dredd comic book fans excessive amount of 5 star ratings.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wonderful love story. Beautifully written. The suspense of not knowing where the story will take us is so worth the journey
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|As an ardent Trekkie, I miss DS9!  Some of the other series are in reruns on regular TV, but not DS9.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon - and I definitely will keep my Prime membership if offers like this keep coming!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun. I have found myself constantly playing. Hard to put this game down. Easy to get everything you need to build your city.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The secret garden was a sweet innocent story of kids being kids at their best.  A story of love, acceptance, belief, magic and a little mischief.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|I just wish this series was indicated Book 1, book 2 etc.  When will book 4 come out.  I have read the first three plus other Jeffrey Archer books.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat kicks major butt. That's all is need to say. Fun for the whole family. Good for new metalheads and for rock lovers alike. No reason why Americans can hate this wildwestern Elvis Presley/Metallica influenced band. Keep it up volbeat. As an FYI they sound even better live.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My kids loved this movie! Now I'm going to have to find it and buy it. There were tears when we couldn't watch it today.
B00316DDWW|4.0|I like the Progressive-ness that this album offers and I dig the sound. Karnivool has found a working element that can make them their own. Alot of songs are groovy on this album and the tunes from the guitar and vocals mix very well. I'm starting to learn that Australia has alot of good bands coming out and this is just another one of those.<br /><br />My 4 stars review is because its not my favorite cd in the world but I am willing to purchase the next album and hopefully getting more into them as I go.<br /><br />Check It Out and Don't just Download!
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Star Girl teaches a young girl how to dress and color schemes. It also teaches how to accessorise a outfit. Great game.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|I love Stone Sour, it's the other side of Slipknot. Their albums are great and this one is no different. I thought their last one was alittle to radio friendly for my liking but it seems that dark rock is still around. It's not the best thing since slice bread but it will please fans already tuned into them. New fans may not grow to love based off this album but it shows that Stone Sour is still alive and working very hard. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are dark yet kinda cheesy at times. There are high points and low points and it tells a story. It is the thought and effert that counts and Corey Taylor has always done that. Crazy to say but after ten years I still am a fan just not like I was before. For nothing beats their first two albums, but hey cant win them all.
1476734941|4.0|This is a new way of dieting - with 2 days of fasting and 5 days of &#34;regular eating&#34;. Takes some time to get used to the fasting days but it did help me lose some weight.
B00C70FH7M|3.0|I love Tesseract, and the genre they represent. I like the tones of the new vocals but all in all this cd does lack from what the last cd offered. My theory on it is that it can be very difficult to write catchy lyrics to complex rythmes. Some vocalists can do it and some can't. I think the last vocalist for this band had a way better concept on writing lyrics. Plus the cd doesn't have much upper parts. When creating a concept album you have to have the high points. Their last cd did that perfectly! Too many filler rythmes on this cd for my liking. good background music? Yes, but that is all.The only tune on here I enjoy fully would be Nocturne. I respect the poly-rythmes but don't feel like every single moment has to more complex than the next. I think Tesseract was feeling the pressure on this work of art. My word of advice, create complex music but make sure that is not the only thing that makes the music good.<br /><br />I would reccomend this cd for people who want to improve their musicial ability but that would be all.
1452126607|5.0|More funny Grumpy Cat pics. Bought one for me and one for a gift. I love seeing Grumpy Cat (real name Tardar Sauce). She makes me laugh.
B00DLKXF3A|1.0|Avenged Sevenfold is done with. This album lacks everything that is Avenged Sevenfold. The drums beats are for middle school kids. The tunes all sounds like they from the Metallicas Black album. The vocal are bland. I saw this coming after the last release. I was just not wanting it to happen. I'm done with them for good now, time to pack my AX7 cds and turn the page.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome challenges. If you like puzzles that keep you thinking, this is a great game.  Will keep you entertained for hours.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can hardly wait for season 4.  I don't find Anna & Mr Bates relationship believable. That is all I have to criticize.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is like the computer version. but I like the controls better. Everyone should know about minecraft.it is infinite, you can play in survival or in creative. You can build anything . The best app to go with it is pocketinveditor. You can change your Inventory and change your world to survival and creative  and back again
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once again, the British have written and produced the best television drama series in its history.  Wonderful period piece filmed in an most amazing castle/mansion in England.  Lush scenery, gorgeous period decor, and authentic dress worn during the years right after the turn of the twentieth century (1916 and forward).  One of the first dramas to follow not only the lives and times of the ruling family, but also the little known lives of the servants.  Fascinating look at the leisurely lifestyle of the wealthy in stark contrast to the long and laborious hours spent by the servants to ensure the impeccable cleanliness and smooth running of the household.  A cultural look at the now almost gone royalty way of life in England.  Be sure to tune in as you won't regret following this interesting series.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|You have to look at the whole puzzle before you start so you have a idea where to go.  I work it out in my mind before starting.  I like it because it does challenge you.  All the buttons need to be cut off.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was a good book and really captured my interest in the beginning but at about halfway through I found myself waiting for something big to happen that never happened. I liked the iside look at her time in jail, but was just left wanting more.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I'm half-way through and there is lots of action -- Genghis Kahn, Meteorites, Dark Energy, Tongs, The Church, Sigma Force, to name a few keeps one busy. I want to thank Rollins for a good summertime read.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Bought this DVD based on all the great reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  A great night of blues was captured here, in terrific sound.  I wasn't expecting the sound to be as good as it was, but in both the DVD and the CD it was absolutely clear as could be.  Seeing Muddy play guitar was a special treat for me, as I've never seen him play.  I've always been a casual fan of his -mostly seeing him guest in other's films without his guitar -The Last Waltz comes to mind.  When I first received this, I played the CD first in my car, and was impressed with the fidelity of the recording, an of course the performances were terrific.  After listening to the CD for a few months on and off, I finally took the time to play the DVD and discovered how much I was missing!  Besides the extra tracks, I was finally able to see which musician played which parts, as there are several guests coming and going throughout the show.  The guitar solos from Buddy Guy and Keith Richards were particularly great, but the occasional lead from Ronny Wood and then Lefty Dizz were also wonderful.  Muddy's brief guitar blasts were a revelation to me.  Like a hurricane coming through.  Awesome.  As a fan of electric blues, I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  As for the video quality, it's 1981 in a small Chicago club, so with that caveat, I think it was shot about as well as it could have been.  There's 3 cameras, and I never felt like a moment was missed.  Considering the constraints of space and lighting and video tape, it was very well done.  However, it's the sound that makes this video worth having.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is a fun game with good graphics. you need real money to complete quests which stinks but otherwise well worth it.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Definitely surreal and frightening.  Since I don't know much about North Korea except from an outsider's point of view, I can only take what the author writes about as his view. The story is a little hard to follow because you don't know what is real and what is not. This book certainly give one something to think about. Is what is real real only because we believe it to be so? Does a story become the truth because you are told that it is the truth?

B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Good action flick but that's where it ends p. Dark scenery hides poor sets and a ton of action to hide the poor plot.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Had already read all the books and enjoyed the dvds despite some of the changes HBO made to the story as compared to the books.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Love the excitement and sci-fi! Can't wait to start season 3. I  highly recommend this series to all Drama Sci-fi fans.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Wow! After 10 years I realized there was no excuse as to why I never saw the show, and borrowed the DVD set from my sister. This series is absolutely amazing, and I cannot stress that enough! Yes, it was dead before its time, but like Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan it only adds to Firefly's legacy.<br /><br />The series centers on 9 characters aboard the Serenity, a Firefly-class freighter roughly around next Sunday AD. The thing that makes this show work so well is the interaction between the crew and the unique personality of each member. When I started watching YouTube clips of the cast at comic con events I was pleased to find out the chemistry extends to real life, as the cast members were (and still are) good friends. It shows through their performances throughout the series.<br /><br />I was 4 episodes in and I knew this was already a 5-star series. &#34;Out of Gas&#34; is quite possibly the best TV episode of any show I've seen, ever. Firefly does an excellent job balancing drama, comedy, and action, and this is a textbook example of lightning in a bottle. Not only should you stop reading and buy it, but pick up Serenity because you can't leave the story unfinished.<br /><br />The fact this show was aired out of order and cancelled before its time is baffling. You've heard the hype, so stop putting it off and climb aboard. I did, and I can't figure out why it took me so long.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love this app. you can download this on any device and read whatever you have across all your devices. One of the best apps I have.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I originally watched this movie when it was released, having never seen a single episode of Firefly. At the time, I thought it was a good stand-alone movie but let it slip out of mind. Recently I watched the entire series of Firefly, and immediately had to watch Serenity again. I was absolutely floored! The first time around I wasn't familiar with the characters, but after having seen the series this movie is an amazing summary to a now legendary short-lived series. If you're reading this and trying to decide whether or not it's for you, I think your mind was already made up. Buy it. You are a leaf on the wind.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|really sets up the baseline for the origins of oz, takes a little bit to get started but over all I say it does the Wizard of Oz justice and keeps the story alive.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I love John Green on Youtube and I really wanted to love this book, unfortunately it fell flat for me. The writing felt so forced, like John was trying too hard to make the characters seem deep, interesting, funny and witty. The romance between the characters was too unbelievable and the dialogue between the two lovebirds didn't seem to flow very well. It was an okay book but wasn't really worth $4.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|As I was reading the book I would stop to think about the movie and how they might have come to rewrite the way they did. The book locked me in at once.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It took me a few minutes tapping around to figure out how the game worked, but now I am addicted. Definitely fun to play. Give it a try!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Are you are trying to get me to tell my friends about this app..........Because it totally worked. I loved the new 0.7.4 update. But I would really love 0.7.5. But I'm telling all my friends keep up the good work amazon
B007HO392S|3.0|It's ok, it has four songs on it that I like, but a good cd to have in your collection.
B004AQR29C|5.0|Awesome movie!!  Funny, action, surprise.  Nice to see so many great actors together!!  One for the library. Nice clean and funny.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Gotta love Toby Keith. This album has a lot of his greatest hits on it. He has put out a couple more since this album, but it is a very good album and a gotta have for a Toby Keith fan.
B004RKXN44|5.0|I have been waiting to read this particular book in the Psy-changeling series; and I am glad to say I was not disappointed!  A great read, with equal parts romance, action and intrigue, with just enough humor thrown in to make it a truly enjoyable story.  If you have read the other books in this series, then you will enjoy this one as well.
B003L16FAE|2.0|They sure cleaned up the grain from this classic.  Maybe over did it a bit.  They made everyone's skin look so smooth, they all look like they were made out of wax and don't have any pores on their faces.  The clarity and HD is inconsistent.  Stick with the regular special edition DVD.  If you already have that one, don't waste your money getting this one.  The second star is just because it's one of my favorite films of all time.
0393317552|5.0|good book insights into societies and native american and euopean conflict; industrial, agricultural, hunter gatherer societies and how they interacted
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Excellent quality and by far one of my favorite pixar films.  This film has so much heart and the main characters weren't even built with one.  Very limited dialog and yet the characters still convey the feeling to the viewers easily.  If you haven't seen this film you're totally missing out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|me and my roomy cannot stop watching this show. It is AMAZING! It has everything a person could possibly want or need from a tv show
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|A lot of people dig too deep for a heavy plot.  I say take it for what it is.  It's a beautifully done movie with very eye catching special effects and an amazing sound track.  Decent acting from most of the actors but I never get tired of watching it.  It's actually a great movie to watch during a workout.  lol
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Highly enjoyable movie, that is indeed an action-comedy.  No slapstick; just funny as life in today's world might be, since we can't cry about the political realities that exist.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Great special effects, good soundtrack, mediocre acting and terrible plot.  Will leave you saying &#34;huh?&#34; at the end.  Zack Snyder should just stick to directing and leave writing to someone else.  Loved 300 and loved Watchmen.  This one is a big meeeehhhh.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use this all day.  Makes Google play movies and music even better. My roku is collecting dust at this point.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|2 sequels and the Avengers later, I still find this one to be the best Iron Man film out of all of them.  This one had heart and the acting was superior in my option to the sequels.  And honestly, I am a fan of Don's acting but I still prefer Terrance Howard as Rhodey.  He just looks more commanding and makes a better contrast to RDJ's Stark.  This is still the only Marvel film I can watch as much as I want and not get tired of.
B00005JKGK|5.0|It was wonderful. It showed like new! The movie itself is amazing! I love amazon and I'm addicted to ordering from them. Overall the product was outstanding. And I enjoyed what I bought.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great acting, wonderful story lines, and stand-alone episodes with a thread running through are just some of the things I've been enjoying in The Good Wife.  The timing worked for me, too, as summer re-runs of shows I'd watched through the fall and winter are about all that has been on.  It's a nice respite from the crimes shown in technicolor on CSI, Castle, and NCIS, some of my other favorites.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game would love to play more levels. Made you think and look every where in the rooms. Let me know when there is more levels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Never played anything like this before. Takes more thought than my usual games. Looking forward to the challenge of the different levels.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I liked it. Even though it's a book for younger readers it's was interesting. I will read the rest of the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome, I just wish that it has different levels not  the same1s. But other then that u will love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hard to believe that anyone could read this sorry novel all the way through.  I've had students in 9th grade use the language with more grace and style that one finds in this book.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Boring. Not much adventure. Would've loved to see more Tyrannosaurus Rex action. Waste of time. Dissatisfied!!! Items are too expensive for a lousy game.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A sparkling continuation of this marvelous saga. If you are looking for a quick resolution of the fight by competing claimants as they seek the throne that rules all others, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a complex &#34;history&#34; of a rich field of potential winners of THE throne, read this.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I didn't think i would like it but then I caught a few episodes am totally addicted now thanks Ang
B0092S4WLY|5.0|It was a lot of fun. I wish there were more levels. Everyone needs to get the app people to make more levels.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really love this app because I don't sleep late and I'm not tired in the morning this is the only alarm clock I have
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so real I feel like I really own a horse :)<br /><br />Awesome graphics I feel like I really own a horse<br />A five year old could play it love the zebra and unicorns
0143117157|3.0|I found this book to be full of interesting information about a great story -- but so disorganized that the most descriptive word I have for the writing is scattered.  It's not what I would call fluid prose, either.  A good editor could make this a truly great book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game! You'll enjoy it for sure. Not boring at all , I'm sure you'll spent many hours playing it
1594484805|4.0|This was a good presentation of the basic psychology of motivation(s).  As another reviewer pointed out the main message was delivered in the first 150 pages.  The lists and frameworks in the next 80-100 pages is kinda difficult to read as prose.  It becomes more of a organizational behavior cookbook, without an index.  I did learn a lot and affirm some things that I do intuitively or fail to do.  A good read overall and I would recommend it for any new leader
B00DJ6KYWQ|1.0|Ordered three times using same payment method used for years and then with new card. Still no sign of download. No help option to get issue resolved. Very disappointing.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter loves this movie! She's even made a game up about the characters. It's definitely on her list for Santa.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I love Gregory Peck and this movie doesn't disappoint.  He's a true hero and worth the watch. It was also fun to see &#34;Capt. VonTrapp&#34; of the Sound of Music play the Nazi.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|i wish there wasnt so many updates but its so much fun i dont care! :) i like it more than the regular angry birds
B00AKYRCNY|3.0|My 2.5 year old boys like it, has all the trucks they like.  I'm sure it will keep them entertained few minutes each day and it is good for practicing their fine motor skills with the Kindle & pen.  However, it is only 1 motion over and over.  Limited use.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|its okay if you want something a little more difficult than Angry Birds but not if you want a mindless game while your waiting in the car or so something.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a little expensive to order, but well worth it.  It has a great plot and I am not even done with it yet.  Love how easy it is to download.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've only gotten to Greece but so far it's been great!  Great graphics and scenery. Holds the interest without frustrating!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I read it twice in 5 days!  It was that good.  There were so many details that I had to go back immediately re-read it.  That is not something I normally do.
B00DQC2FPM|3.0|Wow, sometimes online shopping can make you feel like a \\"Grade A Moron\\".  This was one of those times.<br /><br />Let this be a cautionary tale for those who follow...<br /><br />The \\"Back to the Future\\" Lego set, itself gets 3 stars (I'll review the set below), but the overall Amazon experience gets just one star.  When I purchased this set several days ago there was no option from Amazon for $34.99.  The cheapest set I could find was $57.  With a limited supply left, I quickly purchased the set, lest I miss out entirely on a Lego set featuring one of my all-time favorite movies.  It was delivered thru Amazon \\"Prime\\" but apparently from a 3rd party.  I hope they enjoy their extra $20 it will be the last money they ever see from me. I don't care if they're selling one-of-a-kind Chewbacca bandoliers dipped in gold, they are officially on my \\"Boycott\\" list.<br />You can imagine my surprise when I returned to Amazon today to review the Lego set when I find it selling for just $34.99. I guess it's just like they say, a fanboy and his money are soon parted.<br /><br />Now, the set itself deserves 3 stars.  Here's my rationale: after having built with Legos myself since the age of 3 (that's 35 years of experience) I know I can do a better job of recreating the DeLorean (because I did back when the first movie came out) but I bought the set anyway, just for the mini-figs, the license plates/time displacement tiles, and of course the Flux Capacitor (there's your 3 stars).  Those pieces alone were worth the asking price.<br /><br />As an experienced Lego builder, I feel the DeLorean suffers many structural drawbacks which limit its \\"playability.\\"  Plus its overall look could have been refined by making the set bigger by 10-20%, which would have allowed more than just one mini-fig to ride in it, as well.<br />Allow me to lego-nerd out, bullet point-style:<br /><br />* Each gull-wing door is connected with just one stud, the weakest possible connection, which causes the door to fall off every-other time it's opened/closed.<br />* The roof is supported only in the rear, and again weakly.  The front \\"supports\\" are decorative only and pop off far too easily.<br />* I admire the hoses along each side to mimic the electronic cords, but without reinforcement, from below (which then interfere with the ground clearance, ARGH) the middle connector tends to pop off. (Don't even get me started on the rear attachment component.)<br />* Finally, both front and rear bumper assemblies fall off far too easily (which is actually a problem I've found with most of the new \\"City\\" Lego sets.) I know the new bumpers look cool, but what good are they if they fall off every other time you pick up the car?<br /><br />Most of these shortcomings could have been overcome simply by making the DeLorean bigger.  Lord knows I would have paid more for a bigger set (because I did).
B008M721MS|5.0|Its one of the best ideas. It so good to know that although that's person is not close to you,but in another country,you can still communicate with them,and it being free is so cool. Thank you.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I truly enjoyed it. I did not  think it was going to be this easy to read.  Thank you .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|OK here we go this book was great but not as great as catching fire but it's close I really would recommend this for people who loved the movie (The Hunger Games)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely love this book. The beginning, end, and parts of the middle are great wrenching, especially for a dog owner or for someone who's lost someone dead to them, but worth the $10!
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I received the mirror only 3 days after ordering. It stays in place, looks nice and makes it easy to see behind you. It could be a little bigger but then again it might make the handlebar area too cluttered so I'm not complaining. It serves the purpose. I would recommend it.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This album exceeded my expectations.  The flow of the album is excellent.  This album might actually be better than Nightmare.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|pretty much the classic middle defender. but its got upgrades. solid simple app. fun<br /><br />plus they give extra points for rating...
B0057UAE54|5.0|A must have for anyone who is looking for some of the best music representing that time period without a doubt
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|My husband thought this movie was out of print or would cost over $100. I surprised him and he was ecstatic. A true race fan all the way.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I've have been enjoying this album since I purchased it.  It is different from his other stuff but I am enjoying it.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Not sure where they are taking the series; but I can think of a few more characters that I wouldn't miss in season 4.  The political correctness was obvious in a few episodes; but overall it was a good season.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good time killer, easy to play. Display is super, easy helpful action on different plays - easy to move stacks.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Loved it and the special effects are spectacular. The ending caught me by surprise and I like that. This is a definite see for all Sci-fi fanatics
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great time killer - fun and easy to play. Great selection of different games. Good action and auto complete options
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Action packed, entertaining movie that will keep you interested. Females can watch it to. Please check it out, trust me.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|Has very good detail - even on small country roads. Sometimes better than aps in a jam. Easy to load states and countries.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|An easy read ...good storyline, believable, with strong characters and an interesting town.  I am anxious to discover what happens next in Pride.  I just didn't like the typos that's why I rated the book a four star.
076781326X|5.0|Great actors for a wonderful story!  Wish it had a little less violence tho so I could encourage grandchildren to watch it.
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|The Expendables is a great no holds barred knock out kind of movie, great fun with gleefully destructive good guys. It has a decent plot for any action film, great characters and nice acting, and of course great action scenes!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is a lot of fun but you have to purchase tokens to play more than one or two games
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game because they have great graphic effects .awesome minions you can .buy and up grade you inventions .It's fun I would recommend it to a child if you love despicable me
B000WOXQDM|5.0|Everyone should own this album, that's all there is to it. Nostalgia at it's finest, IMO the best No Doubt ever had to offer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and makes you think. My son and I both really enjoyed playing.hard to put down, because you just want to keep playing.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Each level you were thrown a new obstacle to master, new objects to work around. Very entertaining, never lost interest.
B00006879E|5.0|So of course I had to own it again.  This is the CD that launched Maroon 5, and made me forever a FAN.  Love it....
B000002GVZ|5.0|Great CD.....I have played it over and over.  Bringing back great music and memories of high school days.  Relieving those old days.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|You will love this CD.  Tune after tune is classic Maroon 5....and I did appreciate the no holds barred lyrics.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the way the game plays, but would happily pay a little for an add-free version. Is one in the works?
0061120073|5.0|I had read Betty Smith's classic in college, but re-reading it for Book club was just fabulous.  With age I have come to fully appreciate my Irish family roots, and this was a good exploration of them....
B004X6PRO6|4.0|North Korea is a mystery to us and this book confirms that it is impossible to understand a land where deceit, fear and hidden strength are all equal players. The author does an amazing job painting a picture of the bleakness of society and the strength of the human spirit. It truly was a well written story and a glimpse into the darkness and tenacity of the human condition.
B0068853O6|5.0|What do I have to say about this series? Well I can start by saying I crash camel into bridge. I no care, i love It! War war with bing bang booom and a few OOOORAHS
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is great! Lots of play for free. Way worth the download this game is very inviting. Thank you
B000WQRFR8|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm just starting to get into Kreator, and after listening to this album on youtube I knew I had to have it.  This is just a pure, heavy, metal album with no real BS to speak of.  I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recently started watching this series after friends kept telling me how good it was.  I caught the first and second season on demand and couldn't wait to see what happened next.  My husband and I finally found something we both like to watch!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It's so cool and fun<br />I've become audited to it<br /> No more to say adds odds sail duff egg stuff staff staff
B00190OHD6|5.0|Haven't even got the movie yet but I've seen this movie multiple times and I love it. This is one of my favorite romance/comedy movies because its unique. It is kinda sad but it's still a good movie. It makes me cry and laugh everytime.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great game... it`s also good if you want a challenging game to work your brain. I eventually figure it out, and then it`s like &quot;Yay. I did it&ldquo; So whoever is reading this go ahead and buy it...cause it`s super fun!!!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I am in love with Miyazaki movies he is a brilliant story teller. I like that the main character or protagonist is a female. I can't think of many movies with great heroine&#34;s like Nausicaa. This movie inspires me to have courage in adversity the way Nausicaa did in the film. Wouldn't recommend this movie for small children though some of his other movies like Ponyo or My Neighbor Totoro would be better. Also, this review is completely biased because I like almost every Miyazaki movie I've ever seen.
B00C0QOZP8|3.0|I guess I was expecting something different. For what it is, its good... I guess. I don't know. There was really only one song that I truly liked. I bought the album on blind faith and was pretty disappointed. Maybe their next album will make up for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just loved it-beginning to end! This is a must read! I can so see actor Wilson bethel as Christian grey!
B00004XPPE|5.0|A remarkable piece of political history - even tho' it was fiction, we were so close to events so similar, it was scary.  Scary to watch, scary to have lived thru', scary to think how easily this film could have been historical!  Well acted.  I'd never seen Walter Matthau do anything but comedy before - this was a serious role, and he gave a remarkable performance.  Henry Fonda was ....Henry Fonda - tho' it seemed to me this role was more important to him than his previous personae.<br />In spite of it's age, the film was still relevant: the USA and Russia could still go at it with nuclear weapons;  there are insane people in the American AND Russian governments and military, and there are even more crackpots out there who either have The Bomb already, or could easily get it in the future.  The Cold War is NOT over!
B0035HKWM6|1.0|Well when I receive it and have a chance to review it, then I will rate it and let you know. But they have to put in the mail box first.
B00C2IJJLO|5.0|A classic!  Never seen it?  Do yourself a favor and buy it today!<br /><br />A great movie to watch with your sister, your daughter, your sister, your daughter....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I play it on computer and xbox360 get this game now.if u don't then shame on u u have a bad childhood
B0091REZMW|5.0|I'm just starting but I love the game so far. I think the graphics are really good and all of the quests popping up at first are great!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|First this app is easy to use and set up and it is easy to customize.  I had no troubles setting it and you have several options when setting the sound levels and how it comes on and off.  I think this is a very nice free app.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Very entertaining book...kept me on my toes and I could hardly put it down. Really good series to read. Would recommend.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Great movie. My 3 year old grandson loved the movie and all the songs. An old classic but loved even today.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It doesn't give you any hints or tips but rather it just shows some games being played.  It would be nice to see some actual tips that could help you maximize your 5 lives.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|13 year old wanted ths for her bday. Said &#34;you'll love it&#34;  She was right! Some of the best dollars (very fair price) I spent! Thanks for your help! :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I needed a book I could get hooked in.  There is nothing better than being attached to characters and their lives as if the reader was involved in the story somehow. This book accomplished that craving- to be involved.
B000065V42|5.0|Great movie! A wonderful price. This was a hard to find movie-worth every penny! Thanks for your help! Will use again!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Starts well and does a decent job in drawing you into the story. However it does not finish as well as it started.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Fast shipping, great price. My 13 year old loves this movie and I couldn't find it in the store. Ya'll made my life so much easier for a very small price! Thanks so much! Would definately use again! :)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|A free app that immediately bombards you with options to buy bananas and coins and link to Facebook ...<br /><br />Maybe good for adults but not good for my kids to play with. A shame.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|Excellent story of the life of an incredible man. The story of a lifelong fight for justice and equality is one everyone should read.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Such a good movie! Tom Hardy is always amazing and he brings just the right amount of crazy for this role.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game fell in love right away now run out of energy its so much fun a must have game
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This program is so powerful I am trying to figure out what it can't do.  The invention of computers, iPads, and Kindles would be worth it just for this one program.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just got this game and my kids and me are having fun with it...my grandson only 1 1/2 but he love's making him jump and laughing when minion runs in to stuff..lol...to cute
B007SYWFRM|2.0|My kids enjoy it, but I am going to have to ban it on my kindle.  The game is impossible to exit.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead just gets better and better every season! They have mastered the art of zombie making. I am hooked!
B007Y36K46|5.0|Most people want to escape their lives into fantasy and the books and movie were and are fantastically superb for that reason. I thought the movie was great although they tried to cram too much into one movie to capture a broader audience. I hope Disney or some other movie company will make a second book. Perhaps an adaption of the characters with a new story so the script is free to make a smoother storyline to help the critics follow along.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how real everything seems. This even relaxes me while I clean pet and feed my horse. The sounds amazes me. Nice way to pas time.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I love this movie...great story and wonderful acting!  Both Mr. Rush and Mr. Firth are excellent as are the rest of the cast.  The ending is beautiful...
B00640UICA|5.0|This game is dangerously fun!!!!!!!! you should defintitaly get this you wont be dissapointed it keeps your mind busy with fun challenges and SUPER CUTE characters. :D
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I liked it.  It's futuristic so I guess you can call a hovercraft a flying  ship. (that is a guy thing)  I liked the first person perspective the reader only knows what the main character knows.  The movie followed the book very closely..
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is really useful and easy to use. I use it every morning! you get to customize the sound and really everything else!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read. Nothing can describe it but I've never FELT as much as I felt when reading this book.  MUST read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator for school and this one is so simple and it works perfectly. Its all a calculator should be :D
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|even if it's three hours long.  I kind of wondered if I needed to wait for the extended edition to come out like the previous LOTR.  But the timelines of the releases make me too impatient - especially for dragging this one book into three films.  Of course, the makes me want to know why they blew off Tom Bombadil in the first go-around as that was a big part of the FOTR movie.  Ah well.  I still enjoy this and the extras were great again!
1451675046|4.0|THIS IS NOT A CHILD'S BOOK AND DOES REQUIRE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE.  DAWKINS DOES AN ADMIRABLE JOB OF EXPLAINING SCIENCE IN SIMPLE UNDERSTANDABLE TERMS.  HE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB IN EXPLAINING COLOR PERCEPTION AND THE LIMITED VISUAL SPECTRUM FOR PEOPLE.  I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A RECOMMENDED BOOK TO SCIENCE STUDENTS.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|Unbelievably I can't stop singing the songs after this gets played in the house.  Kind of maddening but it also means I'm still a kid at heart enjoying the story.  I wonder if they'll ever do a similar make-over of the famous Bill Pete story of the same line?
B005FVNIW6|5.0|With a plot twist I didn't see coming.<br /><br />As someone who has read thousands of sci fi/ fantasy novels I'm not often surprised so it was refreshing that Enders game could do that.<br /><br />Highly recommend this one.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fun movie that makes you chuckle and root for the bad guy.  Classic twist on bad-guy-turned-good-guy.  But the minions steal the show!
B004LWZW42|3.0|interesting but made a few  errors as it relates to the other series -- damage to Xavier's legs - his stands later in time-line of plot
B002ZG98J6|5.0|This movie was a great watch for my 10 year old son and I, and I was so glad to add it to our movie collection at a very reasonable price (at time of purchase, it was $10 here on Amazon).<br />It does markedly vary from the book, but is really well done.  The action sequences are exciting...but not too thrilling to be enjoyed by young kids.  There were no parts of the movie where we were bored, and that's a big draw here.<br />Logan Lerman makes a very likable Percy, too, although Grover is our family favorite of the three main characters.<br />My advice?  Pop yourself a bowl of popcorn and hunker down for an entertaining few hours of enjoyment!
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Everyone of Scott's books that I have used in the past (and there have been a lot of them) has been easy to follow, helpful, and comprehensive. This one is no exception.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Like some of the other posts I've read, I too found this on to just be more stuff drawn out. The yo-yo relationship gets exhausting. The first 2 books I read in 5 days and had a hard time putting it down to go to work or to sleep. This one took me 5 days to want to finish it. I can't wait to finish the series since I'm curios where Gideon and Eva go from her. Trying to take into perspective that this timeline of events is happening over just a couple of months.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|The only thing I do not care for in this game is how long it takes to obtain new lives.  I have found some of the levels very challenging and then I have to stop and wait for additional lives to try again.
B004LROUW2|5.0|My biggest complaint about Kindle is that there's no book jacket, so when I \\"picked-up\\" this previously downloaded book, I had not the slightest idea of what it was about or its' length, otherwise I may have gone to something else.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />I was immediately captivated.  There was the bizarre group of characters--the Little People, alternately benign and malevolent, the womb-like Air Chrysalis, Aomame, the girl assassin, the Leader, the NKI collector and many others.  It was at once a romantic quest Arthurian in stature, a mystery with all the suspense of a Ruth Rendell novel, and a story metaphysical in reach that toyed with notions of reality.  What was the significance of the Crow? What was Fuka-Eri's purpose?  Was anything truly coincidental?  And just as you grasped an answer to these and  other questions, the book changed direction and with it ones' grasp of these and other characters.  It was like reading a wet bar of soap.  In the shower.  Really.<br /><br />Shortly after I started the book, and realizing it was remarkably different from anything I've read in recent memory (remember--no book jacket) I decided to peek at the book reviews to see if others were similarly entranced.  I was stunned.<br /><br />The complaints found it  meandering, repetitive, the characters flat and the book too long.  One reviewer wrote \\"What 1Q84 fails to provide is something to tie everything together into a neat little package to make me care what happens.\\"<br /><br />I cared.  The book was magical and transcendent, and I couldn't put it down.  I read myself to sleep and couldn't wait to wait so I could return to it when I woke.  It has a depth and meaning and alluded to secrets which I suspect will only be apparent on a second reading.<br /><br />My only regret is that I finished the book.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.

B00EABIZ2K|4.0|After their last effort, and the news that Steven Wilson was scaling back his involvement, I was skeptical.  Still, I loved their first two albums, especially Blackfield II.  So I gave the samples a listen.<br /><br />They sounded pretty good, so I broke down and got it.  While it's not to the level of Blackfield II, I really do like it a lot.  MUCH better than Welcome to my DNA.  Well written songs, and the trademark Wilson sounds.<br /><br />It'd be hard to pick favorites, there's so many good songs here.  X-Ray stands out though.  I did not enjoy Firefly, but that's probably the only one I clearly did not enjoy.  The consistency of this album grabbed me quickly and my faith in Blackfield is restored.

B00CFYAT6O|4.0|...while it may be the best yet from this power couple (and the extended family they have gathered to play with) it also seems formulaic, and a bit disappointing for this. These guys are all great musicians and when I saw them on the Revelator tour in 2012 it was very much the same kind of music (song format, musicians and playing), AND the best concert experience I have ever had (in 40 years that have included some classic shows large and small). They have found a good thing, but it also seems to me, at times at least, to restrict and constrain them, or at least Trucks.<br /><br />I enjoy Susan's band leading, but it's Derek's soloing that I really come here for, and only a few times on this one did I think \\"Wow, that's a solo! I like where he's gone.\\" (like on The Storm). And I remember thinking this alot more often when he played with his own band or with the Allman Brothers. Part of this is just the change of time and circumstances (he is growing up after all), but I can hear an almost Clapton-like comfort settling into his playing, and this makes me think he's not exploring and taking the musical risks that made me first love his style and sound, and where at least I think his slide playing really needs to go to shine and fulfill it's potential.<br /><br />Anyway, I totally understand and support what they are doing, but I also miss something, and hope someday to hear Trucks branch out and take his music in new creative directions (solo guitar pieces perhaps?). Till then I will come here for smooth and skillful pop-rock-blues-R&B-soul tunes with a healthy dose of tasty licks, and get my more creative needs met elsewhere.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I really like playing this game but I do wish there was another way to back it up that is not Facebook. I don't have an account and do not wish to have one so I am afraid that if something happens to my phone I will have ro start over. Other than that it's a great game
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found the comparison between a 1929 orphan and a modern day girl about to age out of the foster care system, interesting and insightful. The emotional upheaval of loss followed by uncertain living arrangements was comparable. Kline really makes you think about what &#34;home&#34; truly means and how blessed you are if yours is currently stable.<br />Intelligent fiction based on the history of the orphan trains from the mid-1800's to the early 1930's.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Dave Grohl, but this movie basically amounts to so many rock and roll has-beens lamenting that their generation in music is over. Pretty boring if you aren't a rock and roll fan or if you were born in the digital era.
B00BVYQ8NW|4.0|Hate to nit-pick but is the writer on the series in his 70s?  What's up with Sarah using a payphone? Really? You know 20 somethings that use payphones? A pre-paid mobile is like $5 a month. She looks like she could rustle up the money for a cell phone.  Also, what's the deal with the videos filmed between dearly-departed Beth and her boyfriend? Why are they on a DVD? What 20something films something on a handicam.  What is this Grandpa's 75th birthday party? They'd be filming on a smartphone and would never burn it to DVD. It would be more realistic to me if she logged into her computer (after finding the password on a post-it), got into her Facebook account and watched some home movies that were set to private between Beth and the boyfriend.  Also, how does she walk into an investment house and ask to withdraw $75,000 in cash? Can you walk into a Fidelity Investments office and ask for your money in fifties? Does that work? No, you fill out paperwork, request a withdrawl, wait 7-10 business days and get a check you have to deposit into your bank account.<br /><br />Come on man! That's just sloppy!<br /><br />OK I watched the show again and in light of the interesting premise and ending of the first ep, I'm giving it four stars instead of three.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I am in love with not only this movie but the soundtrack as well! The actors were very well casted, and the plot was very compelling. So compelling I wish it would have gone more 'in-depth'. The main characters remind me a lot of the main characters in Pride and Prejudice but with a more Bleak House feel. It's not a funny and light-hearted movie like pride and prejudice- instead  it has that angsty,and cold feeling throughout which makes you really understand the characters.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the relationship between Thorton and Margaret. It was more of a 'love at first sight' type of romance. There was no real reason as to why they loved each other- after all every time they spoke  they ended up bickering. I would've like to see their feelings 'blossom' more rather than just already be there. On the other hand maybe it's because of the strong repression of feelings by these two really stubborn people that makes me really cherish this couple.<br /><br />The end felt rushed but I hear the ending was rushed in the book as well. BBC's version seems to be slightly more favored, though I haven't read the book myself.<br /><br />If you love costume dramas watch it! Just be fore warned its tragic- tragically awesome!
B00EO2I6XS|4.0|Making a film about a philosopher presents challenges. Philosophers and the life of reflection are internalized and often require patience and discipline to understand. Movies for a wide audience tend to depend on action. Directed by Margarethe von Trotta and starring Barbara Sukowa in the title role, \\"Hannah Arendt\\" has the famous German-Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute; philosopher as its subject. If understandably slow in places, \\"Hannah Arendt\\" is worthwhile. The movie played in an independent theater in Washington, D.C. to appreciative audiences. It is valuable that it will soon available and accessible on DVD, and that the film is now available for review and discussion here on Amazon. The movie is in part in English and in part in German, with subtitles.<br /><br />Hannah Arendt (1906 -- 1975) studied philosophy in Germany and wrote her dissertation (on St. Augustine)  under Karl Jaspers. She became an American citizen in 1950, and taught and wrote widely.  In 1961, Arendt covered the trial of Adolph Eichmann in Jerusalem and wrote what became her most famous book, \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem\\" [[ASIN:0143039881 Eichmann in Jerusalem (Penguin Classics)]] which was and remains highly controversial. The book became known for the term \\"banality of evil\\" which Arendt seemed to use to characterize Eichmann's activities.<br /><br />The movie \\"Hannah Arendt\\" focuses upon Arendt's coverage of the Eichmann trial and the controversy her book engendered. Much of the book is set in the rarefied world of the New York City intellectual as Arendt is shown with her dear friend Mary McCarthy (Janet McTeer), her beloved but philandering husband Heinrich (Axel Milberg), and others. There are scenes of Arendt teaching her classes and less effective scenes of the philosopher alone with herself thinking and writing.<br /><br />Then there are scenes of Eichmann and the trial using original footage. I found these scenes effective. Arendt observes and ponders, less facts than theory and motivation. She studied the trial transcript but did not observe the trial in its entirety.<br /><br />The movie tries to capture something of Arendt's thoughts, at the inevitable price of over-simplification. It captures well the furor resulting from the book, with some readers thinking that Arendt trivialized Eichmann and perhaps even the Holocaust.  The movie includes a ringing scene in which Arendt defends her book before a skeptical university audience.<br /><br />Flashbacks show Arendt's affair as a young impressionable college student with the famous philosopher Martin Heidegger, married and many years older than Arendt.  Many years after she became famous herself, Arendt got back in touch with the aged Heidegger and visited him and his wife.<br /><br />Arendt's claim about the banality of evil emphasizes the ease with which people can be ensnared. Many today would argue that Arendt said something difficult and important about the \\"banality of evil\\" while she misjudged radically the character and deep personal culpability of Eichmann.<br /><br />\\"Hanna Arendt\\" is thoughtful and captures its time and characters, including the chain-smoking philosopher, but it plods at times. It remains a good rare attempt to think about philosophy through film.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanied the trial transcript but did not observe the trial in its entirety.<br /><br />The movie tries to capture something of Arendt's thoughts, at the inevitable price of over-simplification.

B00CIWOJUU|3.0|So Abbado has approached to Schumann´s Symphonies and i admit his choice of the second<br />symphony is very symphatic for me. For me it is  one of Schumann´s best works. Anyhow,<br />this symphony is full of correlations to both Beethoven´s and Schubert´s IX.Symphonies and some<br />of the reat concept of these works. Not the doubtless technical leaks  of Abbado´s minor personal<br />orchestra , the Ensemble Mozart,such as ensemble and intonation problems, but  - for me- an undue approach<br />to this symphony makes this CD nor first neither second choice for every taste. Take  Harnoncourt, Bernstein,<br />Kubelik, Szell, Skrowaczewski, Sinopli, ... ... ... ...

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Ah well.  Not nearly as well acted as the 1970's original, but in terms of energy, this &#34;Gatsby&#34; makes the Redford version seem comatose.  It's also a &#34;Gatsby&#34; for our age.  I thought the modern music would drive me nuts, but in fact it acts as a bridge between our era and the 'Twenties.  We may have some wild parties, but a bunch of kids in hoodies just isn't quite as decadent as kids in tuxes and gowns.  And illegal booze is quite a bit different than illegal speed, or ecstasy.<br /><br />On the other hand, where it counts, in the acting, a Madonna video has more depth.  Toby McGuire is practically invisible, a wide-eyed shadow.  Carey Mulligan never seems to change her expression.  And DiCaprio...  When he doesn't say anything he's at his most convincing.  When he talks he sounds like someone faking his dialect, badly.  And when he gets nervous he reminds me of Hitler---the clumsy way he wipes his hand over his hair to push it into place.  Like everyone else, I found Elizabeth Debicki by far the most compelling character to watch, although I must say, when they first go into NYC, to the aparment Tom keeps for his mistress, that set, and the women in it are all quite a picture to behold---the use of green on one actress and red, green and yellow on Myrtle both suggests colorized film and black and old fruit crate label art.<br /><br />When Fitzgerald wrote &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;, WWI was a sharp wound in the collective consciousness.  Today it's locked up deep within our collective amnesia, like the grave of a supposed hero that always presents embarrassing truths each time someone opens the casket.  You don't need to understand the impact of WWI to enjoy the book or either movie, but it certainly helps.  It wasn't just illegal booze and short skirts that made the twenties, but the escape from the horror of an utterly unnecessary war we never should have entered, where corporations profited to epic excess, and where not only were there no goodguys, but the ending was so unsatisfying, everyone knew another war was imminent, just as they knew the prosperity couldn't last forever.  That's why this movie is such a &#34;Gatsby&#34; for our age.  With 9/11 still too close behind us to forget, and too many questions we're afraid to answer, we know we're on the edge of an abyss;  wealth abounds, and if you can't see it in the flesh, it permeates our media.  This can't last, something bad is going to happen, and yet we don't know what to do, so we keep on shopping, keep on partying.<br /><br />No, &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; of 2013 is not the best version of the book, but then again, either was the 1973 version.  They're both flawed, neither can quite deliver the book to the silver screen, but for me, the energy and visuals of this one make it far more watchable than the 1970's snooze fest;  the other one had more developed characters and this one has the better look.  I'll take this one.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I didn't expect this story to be centered on a child throughout, but it was engrossing just the same. I enjoy Neil Gaiman's writing style and he is able to zero in on just what makes a child innocent as well as what can be a child's worst nightmare. A little more insight into the women at the end on the lane would have been nice.
B007IWG3WC|3.0|This is a kinda fun movie.  What that means to me is, you can get thru it and not be completely bored.  It has a good moment just at the time when you were about to flat line. Is it worth the watch.  Depends on your mood and what you are willing to deal with.  If your open, knock yourself out.  If you are on the fence, don't bother, it will just make you mad or you will pick it to death. The choice is yours.

Connects to YouTube and NetFlix, however google does not offer the 3 month free Netflix option.  Compared to Roku and Apple TV, Chromecast is way behind.

Withings has a nifty little connection on the back that lets you check your pulse so easily during exercise.  It keeps track of steps and altitude which allows you to consider your hill climbing or stair climbing into your daily calculations.  The sleep tracker is really good mostly due to the graph you can look at in the morning that shows when you slept and the depth of that sleep.  The text on the iPhone app explains readily the need for activity, sleep etc.  This is a winner.

Just that one reading has allowed me to zero in on my real one thing being my family and thus have made plans to relocate from Florida to the Seattle area where all of my children and most of my grand children will be within a days drive.  I have also already begun to focus upon what my one thing is going to be in my business once I get there and pick my new Keller Williams office.  I thank the authors for making it an easy read filled with great guidance to find what really mattered to me.
B00EPC2ZOI|5.0|So I am four episodes into Broadchurch and I love it so far. David Tennant of Doctor Who fame, with his natural Scottish accent, is wonderful as the brooding distant DI Alec Hardy. He is an outsider to Broadchurch, getting the job of DI over DS Elly Miller, a town resident. They play off each other quite well as they investigate the murder of eleven year old Danny Latimer, a shocking occurrence anywhere, more so in this small ocean side town where every one knows each other and crime is low. But everyone has secrets and the start to unravel and mistrust begins to build among the residents. If the next half of the series is as great, I will be very happy. Highly recommend this fantastic crime show.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. Takes about 30 minutes to play.  Just wish it included more puzzles and could've used a hint here and there but I stuck with it and got through all ten levels. Looking forward to updates that add more rooms.

B00DGMVJAO|3.0|while I watched this movie I thought quote what a great movie for kids but not so much for adults. Had some dragging parts in it and was a little boring at times. But all in all I did like this I did enjoy this but I can't say that its 5 stars so I give you 3 stars.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|I love this show.  Every actor in it is perfect. I honestly thought I knew who the killer was going to be and now I'm not so sure. I can't wait for the next episode but at the same time I'm going to be sad when the series concludes.  If the DVD is released on American formatting, I'll be buying it for sure!
0783226063|5.0|One of a kind story takes us to a fantastic universe of sabotage espionage and vile evil villains. Another angle on life's savior.
B0054TVW04|3.0|Looked forward to reading this author as I have watched him several times on TV.  Expected some new insight and extrapolations.  The good news is that he presents his discussions in a easy to follow manner.  Challenges some old assumptions and develops his arguments adequately.<br /><br />The bad news is that he sometimes confuses Western Civilization with the English hegemony.  In several discussion points Western Civiliation is either a geographic manifistation or a cultural one.  Question for the Author ?If China takes on all of the significant characteristics of Western Civilization, why can it not be considered part of the Western Civilization heredity?
B00003CXDD|5.0|Who doesn't love Willow and his magic acorns. The little guy is the hero and goes on to make many more movies with a huge fan base.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I am nearing the end of this book and am enjoying it.  I saw the series on TV first.  The series deviates from the book in a lot of instances, so it makes the book good reading.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is amazing! Unfortunately the tough parts reminded me a little too much of my childhood, but if you loved growing up in the 80's, quirky friends, and have always wanted an adorable Korean romantic hero...this is your book! I really related to Eleanor. I loved how it seemed to point out that the things you think are weird about yourself are the things someone will fall in love with. I liked the perspective of Park.  His parents' relationship was similar to quite a few GI/Korean woman couples that I know. I loved seeing it in a story, especially one that was so good and told so well. It is great as a standalone story about first love, but a part of me does hope for a sequel. I think $5 tops out what I want to pay for an e-book, but since this one is going in my top 10 all time favorites list, it was definitely worth it.
0061906220|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew to start his kindergarten year.  He is really starting to read really well.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|one of my favorite books of all time. for anyone wanting a good romance book, this one is for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|they play all the time on her DSi and she has other accessories to show how much she likes it
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great movie! Loved everything about it. Never knew what a Neve was before...now I do.  Glad Dave Grohl has it now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Lovely and enchanting.  Wish there were more!  So much fun.  I turned my year old niece onto it, and I'm certain she will finish it quicker than I did.
B005HED11Y|4.0|This was made in the original Star Trek fashion.  The special effects are not as good as the newer Star Trek movies, because the technology has progressed a lot since then.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a fun APP. I won't pretend that I fully understand the concept. I originally heard of it from my niece who suggested that I try it. One day out of curiosity I decided to try it. It asked me to choose four topics (obviously there were many), one of the choices was Graphics & Illustrations. I've always enjoyed that form of art, my curiosity peaked, so I tried it. It was fabulous to see the incredible amount of art work and talented people. And for people who love Zentangles there are loads of beautiful work by Zentanglers. I've tried my hand at Zentangle but my work is no where near as creative as the ones in Pinterest. But it's fun and inspiring to see this wonderful form of art done well by others. And as clueless as I am regarding this APP, I'm still having fun using it.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Suburb acting, great dialog, gritty story. Can seem over the top at times, but doesn't hurt the story.  A ++++
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game and is a lot of fun. It is the closest game to real riding that I have ever played!!
B00DW3GFCY|5.0|This is an accurate film of the history of Pearl Harbor from the Japanese side and the American side, melding both sides into one of the greatest movies of WW II.
B003NX75B8|3.0|I love John Green!  I have read 'An Abundance of Katherines', 'Paper Towns' and 'The Fault in Pur Stars'.  This book pale in comparison.  While I liked it, I was disappointed because it's not what I expect from Mr. Green.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Almost every time I try to repin something the screen will freeze and tell me that Pinterest has stopped responding. It then takes me back to the previous page I was on so I lose my spot as well. Once this glitch is fixed it should be back up to 5 star status.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|an great app. my kids liked the free version SO MUCH I had to buy Temple Run original and now Temple Run too. very fun!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Will be even better when I get a tablet. Reminds me of college days drinking and carrying pockets of quarters to play video games at the local watering hole.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I've tried playing a game for a while now, and it's a pretty fun game although a little bit repetitive. I guess that's sort of okay Missile Command was also very repetitive. I think the only thing that I don't like is activation of malware. I have not found any yet, but I have only been playing the game for a day or so so I have no idea if they will show up later. The built-in defense on the ass for did not seem to detect anything, so I'm not sure if that is a valid concern not at this point.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I have owned this blaster for a long time and I do enjoy using it.  However, it is not without its faults.<br /><br />1) The mechanism used to change between clips can stick sometimes and it takes a few tries to rotate the clip to the next one.  It turning mechanism feels a little weak when you pull it to shift to the next clip.<br /><br />2) Reloading takes a lot of time.  This is what I would call a \\"Novelty blaster.\\"  Yes, it is a joy to use, but not very effective in a Nerf War (compared to the Stockade, which is far superior).<br /><br />3) I once put four 35-round drums on this just for the hell of it.  Was very heavy, but hilarious to use.  I do worry that the weight of the drums may put too much stress on the blaster, so I only did it once.<br /><br />Overall, a fun blaster, but definitely not the flagship blaster anymore.
B009RX7WTI|4.0|I was so happy when I was able to pick up the complete 9th season of Grey's Anatomy! This show is so awesome...I'm in love. However, the season dvds are all squished into a regular DVD case, unlike the past seasons that have come in a more elaborate packaging. Is everyone's copy like this, or did I just get lucky? haha
0785152466|4.0|It was a fun read, just as good as the first. The ending was great, can't wait to read the third one
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love this series.  So easy to get into and you can love/hate all the characters at the same time and go from hate to love and vice versa.  The story is addictive.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Fit in correctly with no problems. System immediately recognized it and I was done. This item was put in my Synology DS1513+ Network attached server.
B006T3RM08|1.0|I cant believe that I wasted $30 for this thin plastic dock to have it not work for me. The magic track pad will not click when it is in the dock because there is this ledge of plastic that pushes the track pas down and locks it a position which will not register a click.....
B008XG1X18|2.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire and when I expand the pins it doesn't show the bottom of it and that is pretty upsetting. It also glitches and freezes a lot. It just randomly closes out of it. I do not like the new update.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I truly loved reading this book...it's nice read the story that inspired the movie. The story make you feel that this could have been someone`s autobiography that of Francis Nolan and her family really live or it could have been somebody real life experience.
B00133KFGW|1.0|We have wanted to see this movie for years.  We are a musically talented family and appreciate many genres of music.  We were looking so forward to soaking the movie in through all things instrumental.  We were ready to be dazzled.  We were sorely and sadly disappointed.<br /><br />Each of the main actors had about two facial expressions through the entire movie.  It felt like watching a sub-par high school play.  To add to the bad acting, Robin Williams was cast as the arch nemesis and played the same exact role he has played in a dozen other movies (Robin Williams as himself?).  Ugh.  I am annoyed when people talk during a movie, but you could not help it with this one...there were so many funny things to comment on...and it is not a comedy.<br /><br />Everything about this movie seemed contrived, forced, unbelievable and downright silly.  There could be a web-site devoted to all the plot inconsistencies that ran throughout.<br /><br />On the plus side, the soundtrack was great.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|Upstairs downstairs genre but done so well it keeps you guessing till the last chapter.  How does she do it?  So young but already such great books written.  This is the book I've read by her and all great stories.  Kate Morton obviosly does lots of research and it shows.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|It's a shame this movie wasn't very popular in the theater because it is expertly constructed. An entertaining action movie that never gets dull and keeps you interested until the end.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I don't normally read comic books, so it was kind of strange at first for me, but as I continued to read, I enjoyed it. The plot was different and I kept asking my mom if this and this had happened during the first season, which seemed to annoy her, but I like how similar the comic and show are to each other. Because I haven't watched the first season however, I felt that the end had a twist.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I've only played with 70 and 140 pieces, so I've only been moderately challenged.  However, I usually do puzzles to relax (and look at nice pictures) so I'm happy with this app.  I also appreciate that I can add on to the initial app, so I won't get bored, and I can access all of my puzzles from the same app.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was a great book but very sad and surprising at the end.  I read a paperback that I borrowed but liked it so much that I downloaded the Kindle version to read again.
B004LUS390|4.0|SketchBook take some getting use to on my Smartphone but has a lot of features. I would recommend this software.
B0080SW3CC|3.0|the book was very old and pages were aged.  some pages were ripped but you could still read the material.  the book served its purpose for the price.  need to clarify next time if the book is new or used.
B00499NHLC|4.0|First and last episode are excellent. Second episode is mediocre. Funny, smart dialogue.  Sherlock character is a riot. I recommend it.
0582461464|5.0|book in excellent condition.  was initially concerned if the item was a cliff note or book because of the notes.  but the book is perfect.
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|Cute game and nice graphics but it get repetitive.  I tried it for about a half hour  before I uninstalled it.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Love Gregory's historical novels. 'twas a good read. I've read others by Gregory and while this wasn't the most compelling story, still a good read.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book was alittle more 'PG'ish then I usually read, :) but I fell in love with the couple and the story had me hooked! A great read!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Love to get lost in the magic. The love story is subtle and pleasing too. All in all great and somewhat quick read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app very much because of how many different games it consists of. everything about this app is awesome and I love it so much
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I love Joe and all of his music.  I love to listen to R&B and he brings it every time I will continue to purchase CDs from Amazon.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|R. Lee Ermey is why I watch this movie. The movie shows what the Marine Corps use to be during basic training.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My grand son is excited every time he comes over to play this game on my kindle. He is 7.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|This game refreshes after 3 minutes of playing it. This goes on until i get tired of it refreshing then i turn it off. Please fix this before I quit playing all together.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I just got HD flat screen TV and a Bluray player so I was able to look at all the Harry Potter films in this way. They all are delightful and visually quite a feast with this new technology.
B002DMJLTE|4.0|Enough from everyone else regarding the plot and opinions on acting, for this enjoyable popcorn movie.  I just review the quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray.<br /><br />VIDEO....<br />  While I have the film on a Standard Def DVD, this is not a direct side by side comparison.  Never the less, the Blu Ray really is quite good.  Colors are true and skin tones very realistic with a reasonable amount of detailing throughout the film.  Contrast is very good and shows an improvement over the Standard Def version.  There is not a night and day difference between the two but a significant enough improvement of image appearance to upgrade.  At no time did I see any irregularities in the form of artifacts, annoying or crawling grain and no stair stepping either, especially in the wide angle shots where stair stepping would be more noticeable.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low 30s.  This was one of the first of the Armageddon type movies that were all the rage during the period of time when this was made and some of the special fx, the comets themselves, do not appear to be too realistic by today's standards but one has to remember that CGI effects were very much in their infancy at that time.<br /><br /> AUDIO...<br />  The audio, thankfully, is a lossless Dolby HD 5.1 codec which produces a very nice and transparent dialogue.  Levels were a touch lower than I usually need them to be so I upped the volume some and then all was fine.  No need to roller coaster your remote's volume once it is set.  Your LFE channel gets a real working out throughout most of the film and the surrounds, whlle largely unused for the first 40 minutes of story set up, then come into play nicely with an immersive effect.  There is some discreet use of the front and rear sides but for the most part the audio is evenly spread without a heck of a lot of directionality.<br /><br />EXTRAS<br />  Aside for the typical commentary, there is one large making of documentary that is broken up into several parts, each with its own 'extra' title.  I did find them interesting and was surprised to learn that the director had also directed one of my favorite action flicks, 'The Peacemaker' with George Clooney and Nicole Kidman.<br /><br />All of my reviews focus solely upon the quality of a Blu Ray's audio and video and I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.<br />Thank you for readingoken up into several parts, each with its own 'extra' title.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This show is a classic example of what happens when you allow good writers to do their thing. The special effects are low end. The entertainment is top notch.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|I just got HD flat screen TV and a Bluray player so I was able to look at all the Harry Potter films in this way. They all are delightful and visually quite a feast with this new technology.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The very first scene in this is (from Serenity) is really Joss himself.  Love his sense of humor and pacing.

B00A27X972|5.0|We know from the beginning that the alien is a different creature from us, but he quickly reels us in, letting us experience his attempts to fit seamlessly into a very foreign society.  His connection with the family he joins, and his ability to bring humanity with his alien presence unfolds beautifully.  The novel was touching, yet surprisingly funny.  I highly recommend it.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Good flying scenes with classic aircraft  Sentimental love story for  the ladies.  Didn't understand the significance of Audrey Hepburn as an angle giving Richard Dreyfuss a haircut when he was a ghost after his A26 crashed during a fire fight.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! great way to exercise your mind. I was addicted from the 1st floor and suffered withdrawals as soon as the game ended. On my way to the app store for the next fix! :-)
B009C7JS14|1.0|If this were not free, it would be a rip off It has a preset location you<br />can not get rid of or add to. You on ly get two locations. I gave it back to you..
B000VLMTHK|4.0|I've seen this band live on several occasions and they are awesome..I know that Beirut is not for everyone tastes so if you've never heard them before you might want to look them up.
B002BWQ6H6|2.0|This is a book for me that can only be read in small increments. I find myself wondering &#34;what the hell is he talking about&#34; more than I like to when I read a book.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|I just watched the blu ray. It was lots of fun. I was hoping the extras would include the interview clip where Morgan Freeman falls asleep. Otherwise, 5 stars.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Startling. Our book club will now be reading it. How lucky we are to enjoy our country as we do.
0321200683|5.0|Messaging has been now part of the software industry for many years, but in the recent years it  is experiencing a new renaissance (thanks to the big data and demands for high scalability),therefore there still is a high demand for valuable books such as this one.<br /><br />It is 2013 as I am writing this review - and yes, code samples in the book are pretty obsolete. You will face some poorly formatted code written in old .NET version and old JMS with pre-generic Java version. My recommendation - get over it, the book is definitely worth it!<br /><br />Code samples are not the most important thing about this book. It's the patterns. 10 years after the book has been published they still are very relevant. Those patterns (as patterns usually do) describe common problems that somebody already faced and came up with solution for them.<br /><br />Structure of the book is brilliant. It is divided to 14 chapters, some are more theoretical, some are more practical. Chapters 4 (Messaging Channels), 5 (Message Construction), 7 (Message Routing), 8 (Message Transformation), 10 (Message Endpoints), 11 (System Management) provide theoretical basis for various patterns. Each pattern is demonstrated using following scenario:<br />a) The Problem (helps us to identify situation we are experiencing)<br />b) The Common Solution (i.e. pattern definition)<br />c) Practical Example and common use case<br /><br />What's more, book has several \\"intermezzos\\". Those are full-blown chapters going through a practical problem from end to end by using previously described pattern. It is a great way how to summarize what you've just learned and it creates a  practical bond to the patterns.<br /><br />If you plan to use some of the modern days integration frameworks (eg. Spring Integration, Apache Camel, Mule ESB etc.), this will be your bible.<br /><br />Last, but not least - there is a very very useful page from the authors themselves that summarizes all the patterns, describes each one on with few sentences and gives you a nice picture so you can quickly recall what was the pattern about. Be sure to check it out: [...]
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It's 2:30am and I just finished &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34;.  The book has more twists and turns to keep me immersed in the story.
B00BEEKN26|5.0|Wow is all I have to say. I started to watch it on BBC and I knew that I would want it for my collection. It is fabulous. I reccomend highly.  I loved it......
B005LAIIJY|5.0|You must  watch this movie, I really enjoy everything about this movie. However; not so much as a family moive, so send your young kids to another room.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Kool I like it.needs more space on some maps..better graphics then some.<br />Dimensions..ask e msn.dimension<br />Comments o pwjdnxnncncn.jxndkdjnxnnxksk..k..ksllwbcbxbbdkwlsnf.back see Jenny.
0345803493|5.0|It was awesome!  So very well written that it was very hard to put down.  I can't wait until I finish the series.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Anything by David Lynch is Great!<br />As Agent Cooper would tell you - The Series is like &#34;A Damn Fine Cup of Coffee&#34;!
0345803485|5.0|Hot to say the least. If you don't want to read about detailed sex, then this book isn't for you.  Very good and hard to put down.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Why do you need to read my phone calls and network information. Too many ads, too. Supposed to be a paid app. Tired of the privacy invasion and paid apps with ads. Uninstalling all my &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; apps.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Thought it woud be second to the Kite Runner but I loved the book and thought it to to at least equally entertaining.,
B007VUA7VO|5.0|An excellent app.  I highly recommend this app.  As it is free you can't go wrong. Provides feedback on hours of charge depending on what kind of activity you are engaged in.
B009VIZDLI|1.0|Not quite my sense of humour.Tried to get into it but just did not happen for me. I thought very dissapointing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's the minions what else can I say love  them love the game it's awesomeness all around fun fun fun fun fun
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it! I think this is a great game! I love search and find games and this is a great one! I only wish I had more levels sooner!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Just like the book and very entertaining. Martin Freeman is excellent as bilbo and can't wait to see smug and Benedict cumberbatch
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Loved it the first time and still do!!!!!!  The show is great and the quality is very good as well.
B00755MHXG|5.0|A recommended read for all middle graders and up. So many people are different and different is good. But we don't get taught that or teach or children. Children often emulate their parents. Let us teach our children - and ourselves - to look beyond outward appearances and, as God ones, see the heart of our fellow human being. That 'different' person could have easily been you or your child.
0385345054|5.0|I'm a huge fan of paper flowers, it's been an obsession of mine for decades now. When I saw Paper to Petal, my mouth literally dropped open, it is just amazing. My daughter saw it and immediately said she was claiming it for her own, and started making plans to cover her entire bedroom ceiling with paper flowers. The projects, photography and layout of the book are all just gorgeous!<br /><br />In the book, all of the floral projects are presented beautifully at the start. Next is the skills section, where every aspect of paper flower making is explained, then it switches over to showing complete instructions for each project, including photos of each step.  It's hard to believe that the stunning creations in Paper to Petal start with easy to find crepe paper and tissue paper. One of my (many) favorite things is the Smiley Mobile. Lovely paper flowers in shades of pink each with a wooden bead with a smiley face in the center hang from a foliage covered hoop. I think it would be such an adorable addition to a baby's room!<br /><br />If you are interested in paper flowers or crafting in general, I highly recommend Paper to Petal!
B00932AA5G|5.0|I love it. It held my breath. The actors are great! The supporting actor is from the Game of Thrones!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Not a kids game. It looks like they give options that costs real money. Not a fun game either. Plus - I had to shut down the kindle to stop the app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This gamenis so awesome a d they don't even understand how awesome it is. I be all like you gone learn today. You gone learn not to fight me today.
B00005214X|2.0|It's not the original.I don't like the retakes because the &#34;times have changed&#34;.Give me the over orchestration. Don't mess with the original.
B00402FGE4|5.0|If you like scifl movies you will love this.  It has a constant angle to the plot with the Earthling always on top
B00846REIS|5.0|There are similarities between this and the Fifty Shades trilogy....about control and broken men.....but that's where it ends. This book is very well written and keeps you totally engrossed, caring about the characters and loving every second of it! 5 stars!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My grandchildren loved watching  this movie and did just that three days in a row. What more can I say.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel! Made me smile and even laugh out loud. I recommend this book if you are in a light, enjoyable mood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game to play on your free time and its great for kids of all ages , over addictive though so play carefully
0307279189|5.0|AH! I LOVED THIS BOOK! I have been recommending this book to anyone who will listen to me. Even if you're not a runner it is a wonderful book about pushing yourself to your limits and achieving something incredible!! I wish I could quote the entire book. It's a must read!
B007SGM084|4.0|Not since Fanny Hill have I read descriptions as accurate as in this trilogy.  However, it wasn't all sweet romance, I found some parts too hurtful for a pleasure read.  Some of the subplots were interesting and took this reader by surprise.  Though I prefer history, this was a fun read.
1416972242|5.0|Love this series! And book two was definitely the calm before the storm of book 3 but it had great emotional moments. I feel like more than anything you were gettin to know everyone a little bit better. Cassandra definitely delivers with this bittersweet follow up to City of Bones!
B000ICZD4I|5.0|One of my all time favorites!  Have seen it multiple times.  One of those films that touches all of your emotions.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|An essential addition to any music collection, particularly if you were around when these albums first came out like I was. Jeff Lynne ROCKS!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons on demand. I could not stop watching. I was tired ever morning at work. Must see television.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Very slow start but building characters / backgrounds is important for the remainder of the film. Once the 'hunting' starts, then there is enough action / drama to keep your attention. Overall I tried to watch this film 3 times only sticking it out the third time, it was worth it.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|I loved the story and the history, but there was too much detail on the sexual encounter and way too much language.
B00B9HTK1S|5.0|It's been quite a few years since I read this short book, but I find it just as enjoyable as always. While I enjoy reading many modern authors, I sometimes wonder if they will stand the test of time as well as Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and Arthur Conan Doyle.
B000OVLINI|5.0|captivating. easy to read and fall into. i may have found a new favorite author. finished in a breath. want more.
B002SGYPS2|3.0|I keep trying to like Jim Carrey and I keep being reminded how overrated he is. It happens every time I go back to watch one of his flicks that I passed on upon its initial release. Maybe it's time I called it quits on him once and for all.<br /><br />The movie wasn't terrible. I actually liked the story itself as well as its commentary on our society's obsession with fame. That being said, Jimbo phoned in another mediocre performance. He should stick to fart jokes and silly face movies as they suit his talent level far better.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Much,much information that I wasn't expecting. I really enjoyed the story line and where it went and where it ended up. Quite different for Dan Brown .
B0064X7FVE|1.0|older version was better. map doesn't play properly. picture on startup is poorly selected because you cant read the text. looking for another app
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well researched and logical. Had the Romans not destroyed Jerusalem in 67 AD, the world would be totally different !
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Solid, every liberal like me should read and weep and be proud of these special men! Support the men and get out of their way! We can ague the mission on our own time, don't waste theirs!
B00BESIKWM|1.0|The movie was awful. That is all I can say about it. The first movie was great, but this one was a cheesy and the story line sucked.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I looked in every brick and mortar store in town without success, but found it on Amazon with no problem.  Discovered, however, that you have to watch out for international purchases, for which Master Charge takes an extra fee.  I'll be more careful next time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The single best book I have ever read. Buy it, buy it now. You will not be disappointed. I assure you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show so much.  Interesting stories, great, complex characters, it's dramatic and sad and funny.  I also like the historical aspect of the show and the period costumes and decorum.  Can't wait for more episodes!
B0089LOG02|5.0|There is a feeling you already know how this story ends. But not really.<br />This a beautifully written story about 2 lives that run parallel and eventually converge .And  each finding family and home.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game.  Difficult at times, but you won't want to stop playing. I would recommend it to everyone.  Have fun.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Some of the other soundtracks in the series aren't quite as good.<br /><br />Overall, rating music like this is a matter of taste and interest.<br /><br />If one doesn't like pirate-y music or soundtracks in general, they wouldn't like it.<br /><br />I &#34;crank up the volume&#34; because the music is that good.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game and good fun. I love the variety of rooms and slots available to choose from. I wish it gave more daily credits to play more often.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini spins the tale of a brother and sister , separated by circumstance in child hood. The beauty of the whole thing is that there are thousands of characters in the story and each has their own sub story  and somehow each of them, every one of their lives , plays a important part in bringing the two together.<br />Believe me, I am a grown man of 35, the story is so touching , finally when the two meet, it is impossible for a tear to not escape from your eyes.<br /><br />The author is so adept at spinning this intricate web that I dare say - I dare say, he has equalled Jeffery Archer in story telling. This is my first Khaled Hosseini, and he has already become one of my favorite authors to read.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Bought this as soon as it came out. like the digital copy. who didn't love this movie? great addition to my library.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|My nephew want this app.  He really enjoys playing this game.  I liked the movies a lot.  I'll even go see a part 3 if they make one. But, as far as this game goes, it's made more for younger kids.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Good game very very good game I love this game Its fun and sometimes challenging I would recommend this game to everyone
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I never wanted to try Facebook. However, the day came when I finally decided to give it a try.  I sure am glad I did.  I have connected with a lot of old friends/classmates that I haven't seen or talked to in a number of years.  It's great way to reconnect with your past.  You can also stay in touch with family/others whom are not so far away.  Even if you're only playing a game against them.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book. very original. Can't wait for the future books to come out. I'm writing random words so my 5 star review can publish...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|When I first started this game it was fairly easy.  Sometimes it still can be.  For the times when it's hard...you just want to throw the tablet down, stomp on it, and throw it...LOL.  Maybe that's a little exaggerated.  But, it does make you want to call it quits and remove the app.  Just when you reach that point you figure out the puzzle and it &#34;flows free,&#34; with no strained effort.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Very good book, but found it a little beyond my educational boundaries. Will be better understood by medical personnel,then by lay man, such as myself.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I really haven't had the time to use this app.  But, I am hoping that once I have more it will work wonders for me. It's worth the try.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|These books are very hard to put down once you get into them. You start to feel like u know the characters on a very personal level, which to me is the mark of a good writer. Martin does a great job of weaving different story lines together, he also does a fantastic job of recounting a single event from different characters perspectives. Great book!
B004YM6JLO|1.0|Gave this item as a gift and have since found that all six discs were scratched beyond repair.  No longer able to return, but annoyed.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is really really fun, but I hardly ever bingo anymore. When I first started playing I would bingo often and complete the puzzles but I am lucky to bingo lately.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|No issues with app. Various levels so players don't get bored. My children will love this game. More words needed...blah.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Its a good game in all but it doesn't show up on my kindle fire hd carasoul screen. It doesn't say that i bought it even tho i did i can open it and play it fine. But if i weren't by any wifi i wouldn't be able to access the game......... whats wrong with this...
B004SEUIWY|3.0|I was sent the wrong bro grimm,they sent 2 copies of the same movie,im not happy with the 2 copies of same movie,please let me hear from u!thanks d hunter
B0075HP2K4|5.0|Hands down my favorite musical discovery of this year. A mix of Adele and Jewel but very much her own both in voice and lyrical expression.<br /><br />A rare treat that i have had on repeat now for a week.<br /><br />You can't help but drift away into the landscape or music she has created and frankly i don't really want to leave.<br /><br />Perfection from start to finish.<br /><br />BK
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I love the Mentalist on television and love having a copy of my own so I can watch it any time I like.  The DVDs I ordered from Amazon were in perfect condition and arrived when promised.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The blueray is spectacular. It is amazing to think this film is nearly 3 decades old. What a film! There's some other Alien films on there as well...but Alien 1,2 and Promethius are great
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Stargate Atlantis Season 1... it really brought back some fond memories.  With Prime it was free to stream to my HD TV.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great bingo game. Love the free daily tournament. I have downloaded other bingo apps, this one is my absolute favorite.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. My daughter and I will play it for hours. Then when she decides she's done, I keep playing...lol!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I work a puzzle at bed time. The music and nice pictures are very relaxing. It sounds me right to sleep.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones are a close relative to the K701 the one difference being a detachable cable. It inherits the same lean and accurate sound requiring decent amplification to show its best.<br /><br />This model is no longer listed on the AKG website where it has been replaced with the Quincy Jones Q701 which seems to be the same headphone offered at almost double the price.<br /><br />They compare well to my HD600 offering a leaner sound with less pronounced but more accurate bass.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|wonderfully detailed and such vivid characters!!! I had watched the movie before i realized it was based on a book. great read couldn't put it down!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child gives us an all American hero in an easy to read novel that will capture your attention and hold it to the end.
0770437400|2.0|Usually a book in a genre I like with ratings this high means I am in for a good read. Not this time. In fact, I stopped reading the book. It is an ensemble of very short tales dictated by survivors of the zombie war. The main problem is that every single character interviewed sounds EXACTLY the same--which might have been ok if they was cool...but they are all boring and one-dimensional. Brooks IMHO captures neither description, narration, nor dialogue well. Not all of the vignettes were bad, just most of them.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Just as good as the Hit. Really enjoy this author and his books. It is the second book in this series I've read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is an eyeopener in regard to the real reasons for the start and continuation of World War I.  I really enjoyed Ken's method of telling the story through various people in all areas who were involved in this horrific war.  The characters were very real and interesting.  I enjoyed this book very much.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|I'm a Star Wars fan. But I'm also very critical of certain decidions they've made befoer regarding characters and story lines. I won't lie to you. there are a few episodes made specifically for kids. If you are like me (an adult fan) they could be boring. But It definitely serves its purpose to attrack the yunger audience. My kids are more attrackted to those episodes than to the ones with complex plots and arcs.<br /><br />Story arcs for the kids<br />- The padawans story arc (4 episodes)<br />- The droids (special weapons) story arc (4 episodes)<br /><br />The rest of the 16 episodes (yes, this was a shorter season) have more elaborated plots. The Ahsoka, Onderon, & Maul/Opress arcs are amazing.<br /><br />This is a must for the collector and also for those that are new to the series.<br /><br />Also, some animation techniques were perfected for this season and the result is an even better looking tv show.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|My hubby was so excited to get this for Christmas last year! It is one of his favorite movies of all time and it was shipped really fast! Great movie and great price.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My 4 year old loves Despicable Me, and was really looking forward to this game, but it's a bit too difficult for him to play.  It's fun, but gets a little monotonous for older players.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started reading this after having watched the first two seasons of the show, and although I was a little worried about being bored since I knew what was going to happen, this was not the case.  All of the extra detail kept me enthralled.  There's just so much more information about the characters, the settings, and the gods that I plowed through the book in no time.  I liked how the chapters are divided up into focusing on a different character for each one, which definitely maintained a good pace and kept it fresh.  It's been a long time since I was so involved in a book.  Even though it was fantasy, it just felt a lot more believable than most fantasy books I've read.  Any complaints I could make would just be superficial.  Go check it out even if you've already watched the show.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great characters, good cliffhangers. Premise is a bit absurd and may offend some real lawyers, but it's a lot of fun.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|Reading this tripe is like playing a mind-numbing video game. It has absolutely NO literary merit.  It is a sorry commentary on the depths to which our society has descended.  The greatest tragedy is that most readers will have no idea of what they are really missing.  Read Daniel Silva, or Alan Furst, to enjoy authentic spy literature.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I actually thought this case was fake, only because there is now cases exactly like the lifeproof.But this case is definitely REAL. If you really want to make sure Watch this youtube video [...] no scam what so ever i checked it my self. Also , this case is very protective on almost everything , which is the main reason i got this type of case.<br /><br />PS.<br />Tiffany
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the book--it  kept me up reading late at night--I was so excited when I met someone yesterday who had also read it and we could compare observations.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Super awesome show! Love it! If you like fast paced wit this is the show for you! Sheldon definitely makes the show complete with his OCD and hilarious hang ups.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Simply gorgeous, so incredibly beautiful. Have seen it theatrical, received it on the SAG Screener DVD, have it on this Blu-Ray, and just finished seeing it tonight on its first run on HBO.<br /><br />Every other five star reviewer here has already covered, far better than I ever can, all the positives of this film.<br />The total commitment of all the actors, the excellent direction, the artwork and sets, the heartbreaking songs; so all I can add to this is, \\"So Incredibly Beautiful!\\"<br /><br /> I have a very minor job in Hollywood, but still recognize excellent work when seeing it; and every actor, and this film, have earned every award that has been given to this production and all of its actors.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I feel asleep with the game in my hand cause I didn't want to stop playing.  This is very fun if you like hidden objects games and who done it mysteries. Can't wait to play the next addition.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|would watch this movie again, it has been added to my movie library, one of my favorites,. Watch this with my brother and we both enjoyed it, even my brother who doesn't always watch movies
B009AY04A8|4.0|good game to kill time with, if you like games where you try to find hidden objects on each level then you'll probably like this game
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Better than some action films, enjoyed it from start to finish. I love Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis, and  would watch again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Smooth, flowing graphics, and realistic gameplay. The competitions are easy so far, but I just started yesterday. This game seems very promising so far, I'm looking forward to seeing how it progresses.
B00866JL96|4.0|watch it at the theatre and wanted a copy to add to my movie library. would recommend to friends and family
B00E63OMEM|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS TOTALLY WORTH 20 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!! GREAT IDEA CARTOON NETWORK!!!! AMAZING BACK STORIES. JUST FLAT OUT AMAZING!!! BUY IT NOW!!!
B0045HCJRQ|4.0|Wished the ending could have been different but watching the movie again realized it couldn't be any other that what the author intended. It is a movie I would watch again.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Great album start to finish.  Ivan sounds great and the songs are big rock anthems.  Would recommend to any FFDP fan.
B00AQ2KLEM|5.0|I loved the movie and watched it over and over again for the music!  Finally decided to get the soundtrack.  I play it all the time in my car, my home, my phone!
0446310786|5.0|An amazing story.  At turns touching, funny, scary and heartbreaking.  I will read it over and over again.  My only regret is that it took me so long to get to it.
B00008L3U1|5.0|This is an awesome movie! Can't beat a timeless Robin Williams classic! Buy it, watch it, then watch it again. I'm sure your kids will love this movie!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|loved how this made the civil rights movement more personal. I cant imagine having live like that; being treated so inhumanely at times to put it lightly. one of my new favorite movies!
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I was readings a sample book and Cat and Bones were mentioned in the sample I was reading. So I decided to do a search for these characters and boy was I pleasantly surprise to find the series. I was at the library and read the first book and was hooked. I was happy to find out that this book was also really good. I really liked that Ms. Jeaniene Frost gave 2 strong characters, Cat and Bones, that are well develop and darn funny.  Although their love for each other is part of the overall story, the book actually has a plot. The conversations that Cat and Bones have are witty and so funny I was actually laughing at 3am while reaing the book, once I started I couldn't put it down. And boy the sex scenes are HOT! And thanks to Ms. Frost I will forever look at English men in a different way. All though I checked book 1 from the library, I am actually going to buy the electronic version to add to my library... Mr. Frost; keep the good books coming!!
B0050Q3UEM|3.0|I much more prefer tune in radio, slacker radio, or sirrius xm. but to each their own i guess.. i hate pandora yet everyone and therre grandma love it
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Does a great job of keeping your interest by following multiple characters and intertwining their lives into a great drama series!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Kids loved it.  Funny<br />Very funny story.<br />Kids watched 10 times already.<br />Good story<br />D1 much better then D 2.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|nice blend of special effects from the animation to this realm. Would love to see more from this director .
B003UBTX7C|5.0|What am I going to read after this?!  I thoroughly enjoyed this series...I think we need them to resurface and come to the rescue again.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really enjoy this game.  I will be playing this game more and more.  I think that you will like it too.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Chalk another one up for the Camel Club.  Always a new problem, with a new twist in the series of solutions.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Used it in 20 to 30 feet of water and the footage looks great! Notice some red tinge in shallower water but really help. Water is a beautiful blue color and made everything pop! Just wish it was cheaper!!!
B0059WTMLW|1.0|I would click on a box expecting a number to populate the square and nothing would happen or something strange would happen and I couldn't figure out how to get out of the situation.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Captivating story & characters - a beautiful read which takes you into the place & time of The Alchemist - one to re-read again & again.
B00BR1EZ3O|5.0|Great story, great scenery, and Clint!  You can't go wrong with these descriptions.  Anything Clint does is usually good, and enjoyable.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Sent this to my  6 year old grandson in Fla., he watched it 5 times in 3 days.. I think that says it all!
B0010V5SW8|5.0|Plenty of action, good story, and truly amazing likenesses of the voices of the actors.  I don't know how they do it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|More than just the romance, I fell in love with the characters and their story. The psychology of it all is awesome!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|The Eagles are a class act, one that deserves the title 'Classic' Artists.  Not for their age or the generation they wrote and recorded, but because of the timelessness of their music.  So many generations have and will continue to enjoy them.
B00BG5CXGM|3.0|Product is ok but plastic is easy stratch and look old. But anyway still ok<br />Iwant more orange collour. Tks
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I wasn't prepared for the reality of the end, but that ended up being what made this movie great for me. Stepped away from the comfortable easy out.  'Principle' 'honor' and 'honesty' are all rare qualities in todays society.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome I am so glad I got it although I wish it was more easy to get gems
B007JNR4XW|5.0|I enjoy the combination of ballet and hip hop - great choreography and inspiring story.. not to mention Channing Tatum
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this book!!! James Dashner did and amazing job. I picked the five star rating because this book had me  hooked  from page one. There was  so much detail that made the book so much more interesting and exiting. I recommend this book to any body who loves a thrilling book. I can't wait to read book two and three!
B001DBMBNE|5.0|I love this album and find myself listening to it quite a bit. All the songs on it are great. &#34;Leaves That Are Green&#34; is a particularly good stand out. Also love the bonus tracks.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|The movie would freeze so much mu family and I couldn't watch it im not sure what was wrong with it we tried different dvd player's and it did the same thing :-(
142314189X|5.0|I read &#34;The Titans Curse&#34; for my summer reading report this year. This book is a part of the &#34;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#34; book series by Rick Riordan. This book is the third adventure in its series and is the second longest book in the series. The main characters are Percy Jackson and Thalia ( It doesn't tell you her last name) and the supporting characters are Annabeth Chase, Zoë Nightshade, Bianca and Nico di Angelo, Phoebe, Grover, Hermes, Artemis, Poseidon, Zeus, Athena, Dionysus, Ares, Luke, Atlas, Dr. Thorn and the Stoll brothers.<br />  In the beginning of the book, Percy's mom took Percy, Annabeth and Thalia to a millatary school in Maine to meet their friend Grover there. When they find Grover, he tells them he thinks there are two half- bloods at the school. So they start looking, and they find Bianca and Nico di Angelo who are being chased by a monster around the school, and the monster turns out to be the Principal, Dr.Thorn. Percy tries to save them by fighting Dr.Thorn, who is a Manticore on the edge of a cliff. Percy almost gets killed, but thanks to his friend Annabeth's invisibility cap, she could sneak up behind the Manticore, and almost pushed him off the cliff, but en an arrow came flying through the the woods, and that did the trick. But then, the hunters came out of the woods and explained who they were, then they realized they were missing somebody. Then the goddess, Artemis, and the leader of the hunters said that Annabeth fell off the cliff with the monster they had just slain. Artemis asked Percy, Thalia and Grover to take the hunters back to camp half- blood because she was going to resue Annabeth.<br />  On the way to camp, Zoë Nightshade, second in command, asked Bianca di Angelo if she would like to be a part of the hunters, and she accepted.<br />  When the group got back to camp, they had a little game of capture the flag, hunters versus campers, and the hunters won because Percy triped in the creek. Then a mummycame out of the woods and told a prophecy a out the quest that was soon to come. The next day, Percy, Grover, Thalia, Zoë Nightshade and Bianca di Angelo packed to go on a quest that would save the world and Olympus. There first stop was Washington D.C. there they found out that The titan Atlas was in charge of the bad guys until the titan lord, Kronos, awakens.<br />  There next stop was in the mountains somewhere (it doesn't tell you where, it only tells you they went west of D.C.) and zombies came after them and the zombies could not be destroyed, but then a pig came out of the forest, and they rode down a mountain and then a Pegasus came and picked them up and droped them off at a desert in Arizona.<br />  They were walking and then a huge statue came alive and killed Bianca di Angelo, but then a limo came and Athena wanted to talk to Percy so he stepped into the limo and Athena told him that he is going to be a good person when he grows up.<br />  They walked all the way to San Francisco and met Annabeth's dad and told him what was going on. Then they went to mt.Tam to rescue Annabeth and Artemis. They fought Atlas and defeated him, and pushed Luke off a cliff and rescued Annabeth and Artemis. Then Artemis asked Thalia if she wanted to be a hunter and Thalia accepted. THE END, of the book.<br />  I think this book should be rated five stars because it was a well written book with a lot of twist and turns and it makes you feel like you don't want it to end.
0060775858|5.0|This is now a classic book for young children as they go to bed.  It is very peaceful and comforting for a young child. I definitely recommend it.
1451695195|5.0|I really don't need the proof, but it's reassuring to have someone of Mr. Alexander's qualifications explain his journey beyond and back is such wonderful and inspiring language.
B000X1MCTI|5.0|Our children and grandchildren all loved this book, even after the target age.  And fun for parents who have to read the same books over and over!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I was ran down on my way to a funeral escort. I lost an eye as well as many other issues I now have. This game is helping with my vision. The Drs replaced my eye and this is good for my eye n hand coordination. It's all rehab for me
B001BKTEZA|4.0|A great read and a must for all those who believe that today's life in the 'West' is so difficult.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best can't get enough of it I love the new update 1.7.4 it's awesome buy it it is worth buying trust me
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Takes me back to the good old days of jrpgs.  Pokes a lot of fun at itself and has room for customization of characters.  Makes for good grinding!
0345803493|5.0|Amazing book could nt put it down.  Loved all 3 of the books.<br />Can't wait till the movie comes out
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|what a wonderful story.  it flows like the ocean.  a pleasure to read.  the images created in the letters and words are wonderful and terrifying, and a joy to behold.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|If you are on a journey of personal and company change ... Understanding habits and how to change the is critical.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I have read it many times.  I was very happy that the movie followed the book very closely and didn't really notice anything (other than Nick being in a sanitarium writing the story, but that didn't change much) missing or changed.  If you have not read the book, make sure you do.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Good Things:<br />  -The acting was very good, very believable and not over the top.  Gatsby was still likable, Daisy was still annoying as hell and Tom was a jerk.<br />  -The movie was faithful to the book.<br />  -At 2.5 hours it still moved fast enough to stay interesting.<br /><br />Bad Things:<br />  -The updated soundtrack was as annoying as the music from the 20's and I found it a distraction more than a nice update.<br />  -Way too much CGI!!!  Is it really necessary to computerize a tree?  For this kind of story I find it hard to believe that shooting a real bay<br />  would be that expensive.  Many parts of the movie came off as almost a cartoon.<br />  -The 3-D idea is really getting old as too many aspects are put in for the affect alone.  When you are watching in 2-D it is very contrived.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Ms. Mvula's classical training is evident throughout this cd.  Her style is hard to pin down.  Perhaps this accounts for the 1 star reviews?  Anyway, I am in my 60's and she reminds me very much of Ms. Nina Simone.  Ms. Mvula sings with a rare authenticity that is hard to find in artists today.  Buy the music and judge for yourself.  I loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it and it is easy for them to play. Minions are funny, just be careful they don't order 'upgrades' without you knowing
B00124PXW8|5.0|Nothing scarier out there. Best filmmaking and it was the seventies! Have seen this a dozen times, will never get tired of it!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I don't have that much experience, but I really like these. Comfortable, sounds great, no ear strain I get from on the ear sets. I've tried a couple of $200+ phones and I say these sound better for home studio. Had them for about 6 months or so with heavy use and have no problems so far.
B00ERP55NQ|1.0|zero detail beyond what you'd find on a Florida paper placemat map in a cheap restaurant. Yes, I've been to them.
B00EDX76PW|5.0|I wish it was out already it was so good!!!!!!!! And there r things I don't think I noticed in the first movie!!!!!!!!! Recommended to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007V4530A|5.0|This is a great quick start guide to public speaking. It is possible to expand each of the chapters into a book in and of itself.  However, if you are looking for a quick overview, this is a great place to start.
0790729393|5.0|Very intence subject matter.  Well acted by all the cast. A look at something that goes on but is not spoken about enough.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Overall not a bad movie, good action, and acting carry the movie.  If your are looking for a thought provoking movie this probably shouldn't be your first choice but if you want some gratuitous violence with a side of solid acting, you've found a decent one.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|Great show very suspensfull. sat at the edge of my seat for almost 2 hrs. would recommend to anybody who likes these types of movies
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There were parts of this book that seemed to really drag but others that were really good. I enjoyed it but felt like my favorite characters were disappearing when I had hoped they would endure to the last book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I brought this for one thing and that was to stream content from my laptop to the TV. It works perfectly... Some review has said it's choppy but its probably more with what they have under the hood of their laptop. I have a 2nd gen core i5 w/ 8gb of ram. Stream from chrome like a champ. The only thing I notice that can't be stream are content that stream with the extension .rmvb the chrome browser can play this if you have the codec but chromecast can't stream this on the tv... Their probably other file extension that chromecast can not stream but with time... I'm sure this wont be a problem.<br />  Chrome browser on the iPad and iPhone doesn't work with chromecast... Hopefully this will change soon. If anybody is having 2nd thought.... Don't!!! For 35 buck... It's a no brainier... And I'm am no android fan or google fan as most of what I own are apple product...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great book....lots of history and human stories as well.  Younger adults should consider reading it.  You'll learn things your history classe didn't teach you!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I purchased this for my son because he had to read it over the summer. I also read it on my kindle. Great story - great writing. A little drawn out in some places.
B0055PMURG|5.0|I also lost my left arm from a shark. I loved surfing also . I gave up but my family and friends help me. So I'm living the dream I'm 9 years old
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book!  Sylvia Day is amazing! When Eva was hurting, I felt her pain! When Gideon was telling her about his abuse, I felt his pain! Now the healing.....let these two have some happiness in book 3 please and I hope Cary finds what makes him happy!  Can't wait to start Entwined with You! 5 stars all the way!
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Action scifi , good effects for the time<br />Has a believable plot<br />Not a omg movie but didn't bore me
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was an enjoyable read, and seemed credible.  Lot of different accounts as to what happened in the raid, but this author has first hand experience.  Majority of book was about Seal training and the culture of the Seals.  Refreshing to see some of our finest still adher to the old fashioned concepts of duty, honor, country, and Family.
B0083DJWGO|2.0|First, let me say I was intimidated by Taleb's apparent wide-ranging knowledge of history, philosophy, geography, economics and culture, which he promised to synthesize into a new philosophical, yet practical, approach to life's risks that minimizes the downside and maximizes the upside - anti-fragility. (This was my initial understanding, though I could be wrong, as I explain below.)<br />Taleb repeatedly tells us that actions speak louder than words; he is a great believer in doing rather than thinking. He has little tolerance for the academic who talks the good fight, but dares not venture out into the \\"real world.\\" But, despite his intolerance of professorial verbosity, he wastes a lot of big words (and a lot of historical name-dropping) only to end up sounding exactly like those ivory tower eggheads he says he despises.<br />He starts every chapter (well, I could endure only two hundred tedious pages) with an attention grabbing opening line (\\"How to survive advice . . . What to do on your next shipwreck . . . A precise protocol on how and where to cheat on one's husband . . .\\") and ends each chapter with a tantalizing promise of excitement to follow. (\\" .. . you will be in for a surprise. Let's see what kind of surprise.\\") But between these multi-grain slices of rhetorical bread is a disappointing air sandwich.<br />Despite his obvious intelligence and breadth of knowledge, Taleb can't seem to get his point across - if he has a point. Take this passage from page 171: \\"Many people keep deploring the low level of formal education in the United States . . . Yet these fail to realize that the new comes from here and gets imitated elsewhere.\\" (Italics in original). What does this mean? The book (the first half, at least) is infested with these non sequiturs that left me feeling like the boy digging through a mound of manure expecting to find a pony.<br />There is no pony,<br />Taleb, at one point (just before I called it quits), quotes St. Thomas Aquinas: \\"An agent does not move except out of an intention for an end.\\" A pretty clear and obvious, statement, no? But Taleb misinterprets it to mean: \\"the illusion that you know exactly where you are going, and that you know exactly where you were going in the past, and that others have succeeded in the past by knowing where they were going.\\" He then goes on to build his case on this false foundation.<br />I humbly grant that Taleb may have a brilliant insight into the achievement of human happiness, anti-fragility, but this work is so poorly organized and poorly expressed that I gleaned almost nothing from it. Well, I did learn what a flaneur is. That was worth the second star.<br />Did I mention that I read only the first half of the book?does not move except out of an intention for an end.\\" A pretty clear and obvious, statement, no? But Taleb misinterprets it to mean: \\"the illusion that you know exactly where you are going, and that you know exactly where you were going in the past, and that others have succeeded in the past by knowing where they were going.\\" He then goes on to build his case on this false foundation.<br />I humbly grant that Taleb may have a brilliant insight into the achievement of human happiness, anti-fragility, but this work is so poorly organized and poorly expressed that I gleaned almost nothing from it.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is awesome you should totally get it if you like having dinosaurs you get to have land, water, and arctic places it's very fun!!!!!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|A great way to challenge yourself and waste some time. Sometimes frustrating but always enjoyable. I would recommend this game to my friends
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's exactly what I would have ever wanted with MTG.  Now if they'd only make it multiplayer online...... it would be a dream come true.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I had never heard of James Altucher before I was given this book. It came as a surprise gift, from an interesting guy & I only read it since I was more intrigued why this guy gifted me this book after the first time we ever spoke!!! But I am glad he shared & here is what I have to say about it, now that I've read it:<br /><br />I liked it. A lot. Especially since it's written in an informal way & it's a little cheesy. There are plenty of real life lessons in this book. And, it totally validates some of my own beliefs! It does outline things that I already know but can't manage to hold on to and keep forgetting. I am hoping that the daily practice would help me to overcome few of these lifelong battles.<br /><br />So I am just soaking in... & passing it along! It will make a huge difference in your life's perspective.
B008MM9630|4.0|Not liking being in the dark. But like playing the game so far. Would enjoy a shorter wait time on the crops.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|Bringing Mathew back is easy...just do what the TV program Dallas did...Bobby gets out of the shower and said..I had the strangest dream last night..the result would be making what happened in season 3 some what non-existence....
0756407915|5.0|Great sequel to The Name of the Wind. Rich characters and an exciting story! It was hard to put down
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Just a perfect blend of gothic style,  mystery, thriller, and noir that had me turning the pages compulsively. This is my first novel by Lehane and it's made him one of my favorite  authors.
1250029465|5.0|This is one of the simplest yet heartwarming stories I have ever read. Am glad I bought it so that I can reread it whenever I feel like it - which will be often.
B000050XEI|5.0|I enjoy Enya's music and would recommend it to anyone. This review however, is a total pain. The exact numbers of words used is totally stupid. Just saying &#34; I enjoy her music&#34; says all it needs to. I won't reply to any other reviews because of this.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|This album has been in heavy rotation on my list lately, still not tired of it. It really is fantastic stuff.
B000024V8E|5.0|I enjoy Enya's music. This review is a total pain to have to answer all the questions in the format of having a set figure of words. It won't be send future reviews because of it. I have better things to do.
B007R41E8O|2.0|The graphics were great, storyline kept my attention. However, numerous times during play on my Kindle Fire, it would &quot;stall&quot; and take me to the main menu. I would usually have to redo the last couple actions then. And yes, the ending left a lot of questions unanswered.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|Even though there were so great actors in this movie. I thought it was boring and fell asleep. Maybe I will try it again.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I have it for 2 weeks now . didn't see too much content but the glasses work very good.<br /><br />I have sharp TV 60'' it looks very good .<br /><br />I don't know if it's better or worse then others b/c I never used different model. the glasses look very professional .
140006922X|4.0|Zealot was an objective review of the life of Jesus.  It is interesting that it was written by a person who was a Muslim, then a Christian, and then a Muslim again.  Perhaps Allah and God are the same.  Perhaps we understand God better through the life and teachings of Jesus.<br /><br />I am now reading Paul, Apostle of the Heart Set Free by E. F. Bruce, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, Grand Rapids, MI, 1977.  It gives a better understanding of the expansion of the Christian religion and a person who turned from persecuting Christians to spreading the gospel of Christ.
B007N8RULO|1.0|just not what I was looking for.  maybe too old to learn something new. other then that looked interesting when first thought of.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books much more than this one.  I know Gideon's body is that of a god but it don't need to be reminded of it in every chapter. The story started out slow and didn't get better until 2/3rd into the book.  Once it started getting good it seemed to be rushing through everything.  it made Eva appear to have a lot more issues to handle at once.<br />I am looking forward to the next book.  I'm hoping its better than this book.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is great...it downloads properly and shows alll your emails...and it can be the best email source to use for kindle fire
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This novel was so well written and you couldn't help but just fall in love with the characters. The only critique I have is that it was sometimes hard to believe that you were reading a teenage narrator's words.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Just about the most fun racing game, and it's only .99&cent;.  Super fun, I recommend it.  Mega improvement from asphalt 7.
B00A0HQ7H8|3.0|I enjoyed Lana's first album more than this one.  A lot of the songs on this album sound similar to me.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I had just read Susan Dunn's '1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler-the Election amid the Storm', an already fine book about the same subject, but Ms. Olson somehow manages to make the period and players more alive. She also dwells more on FDR's failure to act during all of 1941, up to  Pearl Harbor, making more clear the damage done to his own self confidence by the failure of his court-packing scheme, a few years earlier, than other writers have done.<br /><br />Her earlier book, 'Citizens of London', appears to be a product of the same research. If so, she was wise to write two books instead of one, which may have been sprawling and disjointed.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Love the book is so good.awesome book by Lois lowry. Help Getty ignore this just want to submit thank you
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|This was not as bad as we had been led to believe, but it could have focused more on the people and not so much on all the backgrounds and hullaballoo and anachronistic music.  The cast does the best it can while competing with all the noise and commotion.  They tell the story of Gatsby via his neighbor during the roaring 20s.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game has managed to keep me entertained and returning to play the game. So far I have no complaints.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The CG of the ship makes the show feel more real. The story lines are really good, This made me a trekkie.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|This wrap up of the star trek triology  met all expectations. Star trek fans every where will love this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really liked the movie and would advise this game for any one to play to pass time.  I love Disney movies!
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|After watching the MTV show catfish and learning that Nev also experienced the same thing as the people on the show, I was intrigued by his story and had to learn more. This was quite an eye-opening story and hard to resist watching!
B0058OUJA4|1.0|Yeah no. You can't have access to my accounts. That's BS. Amazon, you fail. Again. The free app of the day is a joke.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I hate it because unknowingly I did not order the right one. This is my oversight-but the delivery and product were very good.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Great performance, love the fact that it is live. Great sets and costumes. If you like Phantom you have to have this!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I NEED to go see them now! They are the future of acapella singing. Tiered music blew my mind! Wow
B009AY04A8|4.0|Lots of dialogue but fun and looking forward to the next adventure. The graphics are good as well. I would recommend this game.
B008745B32|5.0|Some have said that, in a successful novel, the reader has to care about the characters.  I can't honestly say I cared about anyone in this curious book.  I found Charles to be inarticulate and almost everyone else to be annoying.  The only character who appeared to have much of a brain was Cordelia, who had a backbone and a heart.  She told the truth.  Everyone else deluded themselves.  Waugh, and his overuse of commas, simply hints at motives.  I don't think even he liked these characters much; certainly not enough to raise the curtain on what was going on.  Sebastian simply disappears, he doesn't speak for himself.<br /><br />I did enjoy the language, as old-fashioned as it was.  My favorite quote was classic and clever:  \\"He is dying of a long word.\\"  Yes, read this book carefully and use your dictionary.
B00422LESO|5.0|When I finished reading Austenland, my first impression was that I liked it.  The more I considered it, however, the more I realized I loved it. Like a great Austen novel, it not only is fun and entertaining, it is also quite thought-provoking. I particularly loved what it says about balancing fantasy and reality. Maybe what we think is the dream is the reality and what we think is the \\"real world\\" is actually the illusion.  Instead of being ashamed of our fantasies and settling for mediocre, maybe we all need to dive in head first to our own Austenland and not give up before we've even attempted to give our dreams a chance.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I started with the epic because i thought the other models would be to easily completed. I wasn't disappointed with this one... Kind of hard but that's the point.<br />Beware : Very addictive toy. You put it down and end up picking it back up 30 seconds later.
B005LAII80|1.0|it was the most depressing movie I have ever seen. woman bites off a mans body part with her teeth, has everyone making and or selling drugs. uses her hands to blind her own son, throwing men off the 200 floor.<br /><br />I will never watch this movie again
B008602KQI|4.0|The action was entertaining, but like story line seems improbable. If I watched it again I would skip through the corny parts.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Paid for the app through amazon appstore to play multiplayer and when my gf and I try to link up it says that our games are missing data. Bought two copies of the game for nodda. Uninstalled/reinstalled after purchase, lost my progress and still no multiplayer.......lame
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This book is very good. I am getting to the point I dont want to read the reviews. Its is another favorite author for me
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful series.  With no breaks it feels like you are part of what is happening,  This deserves the highest awards for the TV industry.
B002VHI8T0|3.0|It was a book club choice, not mine. Nevertheless it was a good read although slightly contrived; maybe more than slightly?<br />A style of writing some may struggle with but it kind of lent itself well to the narrative.<br />In some ways it was that voice in the head story but at others a story I could anticipate.
0307476073|5.0|Well written.  I love how Cheryl Not-Her-Last-Name Strayed artfully looked back a full decade to pull this trip alive for us on the written page some 15 years after it happened.  She paints herself up like it was was just last week that she took up this massive hike, completing all of those 1,100 plus miles on the Pacific Crest Trail heart in hand.<br /><br />I liked the end made sweet but not too sweet with the finishing touch of placing her hand on that trail's end concrete abutment at the Bridge of the Gods on the Colombian River.  Seems like she put away her pack for good after that, having found herself.  Good for her.  She must have got busy finding a man, too; and starting a new family as this seems her reward for getting busy at getting whole and moving past her grief and sense of, well, being a \\"stray\\".<br /><br />This tale would be nothing but for the Big Hole In Her heart theme that runs from cover to cover.  The death of her mother at age 45, being lost and playing with heroin's fire; and a hundred other demons.  Throughout you just want her to make it.  And, she leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter; and thus her memoir reads like a good novel.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by a writing professor from Humboldt, David Holper of College of the Redwoods.  He noted well what I also found, that Strayed has a great skill with Memoir form moving back and forth from the trail story to her family story/wound with ease.  She gets you believing as a writer that you can do the same thing.  If she can hike it, you can too.  If she can write it, same.  Very inspirational.<br /><br />I've recommended this book to several folks this year.  And more to come.  Only wished I'd read it sooner.  It's not about hiking as much as it is being on the road to find out.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love having ambient noised when I study (especially binaural beats) and this really does the trick for me! I would definitely recommend this app.
B00846REIS|3.0|I felt like the character development at the beginning of the book was rushed. It was like they just met and the next day they were in a full on relationship. Also, the emotional trauma of both characters was too much for me. I still haven't finished it. I wouldn't say it is awful, just not for me.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have all three of the cut the ropes and they are great I think this one is the hardest
B004P7CNUY|4.0|I rather enjoyed it. I hadn't seen it before, so I wasn't sure of what to expect in the scare factor side of things, but it was rather good.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love it as a kid! Love it on kindle! Fast and fun! Flash from the past! Go play it NOW!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This book was &#34;out there&#34;. While it kept me interested enough to finish it, I didn't care much for it and won't recommend it to other readers.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great for family members of all ages..recommend it to anyone who has not seen the movie..great from start to finish
B004ODLUF8|4.0|Material in compact format. To students interested in astronomy a great enticement to learn more and more..A valuable asset in our library.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This is one really quirky movie with some really great acting. I really don't want to say to much to avoid giving away the plot but if you like movies that leave you wondering what the heck is going on right up to the end; this is one that you'll like.
B000Y0Q5NM|2.0|I have friends that love Stargate, and all I can say is that it has fallen flat.  The acting is fine, but the episodes are cheesy at best and stupidly predictable most of the time.  Meh, take it or leave it.
B002BVYBC4|4.0|I liked the original \\"Fast and Furious\\" better than this one but then I love Vin Diesel.  Paul Walker is back in this one, though, along with Tyrese Gibson. They make a daring car chase duo.<br /><br />Special effects were fun in the movie. There were a few times I went 'whoa.' I especially liked the semi truck scene.<br /><br />Also, it was nice seeing a couple of American made hot cars in this film.<br /><br />I bought [[ASIN:B00BFZBMDS Fast & Furious: 1-5 Bundle [Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]]] so it's on to #3 Tokyo Drift next. I love these movies.
B000TEPIYA|3.0|The album is okay, but I mainly purchased it for one song.  The album was such a bargain, I couldn't go wrong.
B001GF8WPI|5.0|I can watch this over and over again.  It never gets old.  I liked it so much that I bought the soundtrack.  Love the scene with the Reckless Eric song best.  ;)  Did not want to give it away here though.  Definitely worth seeing.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|If you are interested in military, history, or just entertaining stories of heroism, this book will definitely satisfy. Marcus Luttrell's details of life as a Navy SEAL and the disastrous Operation Redwing, and the firsthand account of the valor of Michael Murphy make for an incredible read.<br /><br />Although I may disagree with Luttrell's personal politics, I often reconciled those differences by allowing myself to appreciate what it takes mentally to serve in an elite military unit and how that shapes your world view. Funny, heartbreaking, uplifting and inspiring.
0786956291|5.0|If you have never played D&D this is the perfect place to start. Easy step by step instructions and the cost is inexpensive so you can try it without breaking the bank.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Product was shipped on time, and packaging was ok. Batteries fit my garage door openers and have been working fine for over 2 months. Good battery for the price !
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|SHout Factory recently released this gem on blu ray. Not too expensive and a great 1080p job of restoration. A must for Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin fans.  Oh, and beautiful Angie Dickinson as well! Hotness!
140006922X|5.0|As I always thought ,The bible is  a story book not a text book and as the &#34;Zealot&#34; points out that is the case.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|product works excellent charges iphone fast. i would recommend this product. comes in a nice white and grey. makes a great buy
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|All fun it's like a kid game but older people. Y'all SHOULD'VE really get it if y'all like guessing they have fire trucks and more questions. Here's an example a piece of corn and a dog everybody knows that one!l
159463176X|5.0|Beautifully written- a great story by an excellent writer.  A truly memorable book.  I really do suggest reading this for anyone who likes to read a sprawling story.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting. I have my family hooked on it and my youngest is 19. It's perfect for all ages. I only have one question though...can I have multiple logins for my kindle fire? If I could, this would make me even more impressed with this game.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I like this microphone on my Nikon D7000. It has plenty of volume for the times that I have used it.  These uses have been in indoor situations.  The microphone does not take power from the camera or use batteries.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Nice work with the book I like it so much more loosely the only one of this articular juju judgment
B0087IT8LO|5.0|An international film to be enjoyed with or without the Englishtranslation. A real-life story so up beat that I found myself frequently laughing.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|My perspective: I judge movie on its own merit. I didn't read comic book.<br /><br />Let me summarize this movie to you:<br /><br />Judge Dredd growls something with supposedly scary voice.<br /><br />Judge Dredd shoots.<br /><br />Brains on the wall.<br /><br />Judge Dredd changes ammunition type and shoots again.<br /><br />More brains one the wall.<br /><br />If this is all you expected you may like it. As for me - I am sorry for wasted time and network traffic.
140006922X|5.0|As a teenager I, too,had many questions. Reza Asian gives the reader the 'historical' era and events to understand the facts that have been documented so far. He gives balance to facts and faith. One learns much that, for me, had not been taught in Sunday Schools and Churches.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Plot is rather primitive and movie is just boring more often than not. Tom Cruise is doing his thing which gets old. Both female leads are pretty bad as far as acting goes. If I paid two dollars for HD rental I would give 3 out of 5.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This film is so true to life and the acting tells the story as it is.  Everything is wonderful and great.
0740785508|5.0|Gurney's instructional books are always superb. For me, not as information laden as Color and Light, his other book, but offered a much more in depth look at Gurney's process and how he visualizes the non-existent. Not much else needs to be said, except that if you are an illustrator, you need to read this! If you love art in general, or fantasy art in particular, you need to read this. If you like looking at pretty pictures, you don't necessarily have to read this, but if you look, I predict you will read! Highly recommended.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The happy ending made me feel satisfied and calm with the world - as I am now and maybe forever.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A quick story with surprises at every turn of the page. Couldn't put I t down. Read it in less than 24 hours.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  Author presented a powerful case that carried you over a long lifetime of an orphan lady.
140006922X|3.0|The information presented in Zealot is not new.  The author presents the same ideas over and over in different chapters.
B008OOYALE|5.0|If you love dragons as many of us do, then you are going to love this game. Very good graphics for a non PC game. You get to breed all kinds of cool dragons, make friends, get gifts and more. An absolute must have game for all ages. Beware parents...there is an option to use real life money to get you things faster in the game, this is not a must by any means, but the option is still there...so if you have little ones that you allow to play this game make sure of a password.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love loved I Dr read it in two days could not put it down!!!!!can't wait for the movie can u say epic
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a great read- especially if you have ever done some hiking on the PCT.<br />A bit more introspective than I expected and enhanced the background for the long hike.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I have had the app for about a week now and have used or previewed most of the features and workouts. It's a decent product. You can choose a full body workout or target areas. There is also a cardio only options. The moves will be familiar to anyone who already works out, although I did find a couple I had not seen before. For others, there are written instructions to go with the video. It's all timed, so it's not based on a certain number of reps, just how many moves you perform in the given amount of time. There is also the option to create your own routine using pre-loaded exercises. So, there is a little bit of customization available. My only real complaint is that a ton of specific target areas are burried in the &#34;arms&#34; option. There isn't an option for chest, back, or shoulders alone. All of those moves are listed in &#34;arms.&#34; So, if you want to target your back (for example) you have to use the &#34;arms&#34; workout and customize. Even then, there are not as many exercises for the back. This seems odd to me. Still, it's easy to use and fine for some variety. It would certainly be good for travel because you can do all of the moves without weights.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I used it all the time initially but now I cannot get it to go to by orginal notebooks easily.  Not sure when an update occurred but it did not enhance my experience
B00CATSONE|4.0|Interesting insight on the early inventors. A shame he was never really recognized a great intellectual  like some of the others.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Amazing read and great character development! I would recommend this series to any avid readers. I had difficulty setting it down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|As always Rovio comes through again.<br />Great game.<br />Keeping it up Rovio.<br />One never know what those Bird's are up to.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I saw the movie in preparation for going to California Adventureland and it was so worth it.  I am always so amazed at the detail, I have remind myself that it not real, its animated.  The characters are so well thought out and colorful both in personality and appearance.<br /><br />Thank you for the opportunity to see this great film..
B005HSL626|2.0|Hard to play.<br />If improved, I may consider purchasing again.<br />Too many strokes required on the screen to score points......
0385341008|5.0|It is a very entertaining and unique story! This book made me want to visit Guernsey sometime in my life!
B0094MFITS|5.0|Great drama and suspense.<br />Would watch again...<br />Everybody would like watching...<br />Would like to see more stories based on Jessie.
B00000634J|1.0|Simply put, the CD skips all over the place and is a worthless piece of junk to me.<br />Because I only paid $1.75 for the item and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it, I threw it away and will never do business with Abundatrade.com again.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Could not down at the time of purchase.<br />No charges incurred.<br />Correct the download issues and I may considering attempting a purchase again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After reading Hunger Games and to prep myself for the upcoming movie; I decided to read the sequel.  I liked the story that birthed the rebellion.  Reading it on my kindle I was able to take it with me wherever I went.  I took it to restaurants, the mall and in the car.  Love having the portability without the bulk.

B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Some of the songs live up to the explicit label but they all were good and loved the beats to dance to

B00C28J2VQ|5.0|Really liked this movie if you've seen the first one you'll know what to expect with the second one. Great all around
B002VECM6S|2.0|The movie is edited but was not advertised as such. Why were scenes deleted? Two of my favorite scenes not on film.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great Series. I don't won't to write any more but they are making me otherwise my start series would not be added.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|loved. it. I would forget that time had yon by and it was 2am. cant wait to be the scourge of the sea.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is both fun and addictive. I can't seem to log off for hours.  It is also easy and helpful to gain chips and coins
B006885W2E|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said about this? I will take Dr. Franklin's advice and say no more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome u can build anything but on survival u have to kill MONSTER but who cares this game rocks!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Inane story: only selling point is sex.  Predictable outcome.  Save your money; it is not a book I want to own.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is an amazing author. I couldn't put this book down and finished it on 2 days and left me crying. I can't wait for the movie!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's let me through the other life who suffer than me. I got the bless from someone above and feel really grateful to still alive.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Interesting perspective on how and why people that survive terrible hardship.  Author writes as an observer of others although he himself was subjected to the Nazi prison camps and same trials as those he observes.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book even though there was so much tragedy. Great way to read history without being bogged down in musty old history books. Can't wait for the third book to come out.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This was a  book our book club picked to read.  Honestly have still not finsihed it.  It really drags at least at the beginning.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|If you are into golf (or not) this is a really good movie. Full of heart touching scenes and beautiful scenery
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|There is so much to do in this game, hidden object, logic puzzles, picture puzzles, and more. Very different and exciting. Addictive.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I learned a lot about what went on with the Eagles. It was also great to see Linda Rondstat and Jackson Brown.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book couldn't have ended the series any better. It is heartbreaking and exciting all at the same time. This series is one I will be reading over and over again.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|This book was hard to keep you focus on, but I kept reading because my father and my grandparents where from Yorkshire, England and it brought back memories of listening to my grandparents talk. The story line had to many back and forth for me.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I'm  enjoying this game it challenging, fun and test,s your  ability too solve puzzles with only using picture's. It stimulates the mind and keeps your memory alive. By figuring the words of this puzzled picture.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I love this movie - it's especially great for those of us that watched the original series - lots of nods to the stuff we loved! Plus Leonard Nemoy as old Spock. The bad part was the streaming. Had to pause every few minutes for the last hour of the movie - so many interruptions it got hard to stay with the story. Definitely won't try HD again and not even sure about SD...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't stop crying.  I really can't stop. It's so amazing and so perfect. I love John green. I really do.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show. If you haven't watched it yet you should give it a chance, I have yet to find a person who doesn't like it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game was way better before the latest updates. Unless you spend money now, there are fewer chances to play or get power ups. I really loved this game, now not so much.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I'm a fan of Star Trek old or new. Not a Trekkie but still a fan. Love this movie, it helps that Chris Pine is incredible good looking too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it cuz I can keep in touch with my friend's and information on and about movies and shows I like and watch so there is nothing I dislike about it
B005LAII8A|5.0|I liked the premise of this movie. The action was very well done and the story held up. The acting was very good. Willis did a nice job and Gordon-Levitt is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. He seems to be able to do any type of character. This one was very enjoyable. There was a good deal of violence so that should be taken into consideration when letting kids view it.
B005IDXIL2|5.0|I like this game cuz it is fun and it is a good game and there is nothing I dislike about it
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|This movie had an excellent story and plot. I was very impressed with the acting. Jude Law was excellent. It does have a twist in it. No nudity or extreme violence.
0393343405|4.0|Informative, well written and compelling. Not a book for the devotedly religious, but an excellent read for those with a more open mind.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I have read all the Bourne books and this movie carried on the Ludlum tradition. I really enjoyed Renner's character and how well he did with it. My husband watched it several times and was also very happy with it.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Do not get this app. It can't tell you what your age is. I test driver it and it told me I was 24 when I am 10.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|This movie did not do a bad job following the book. It is a pretty movie and enjoyable to watch. Always like Redford.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you choose to read this delightfully crafted story please allocate yourself several hours and expect it to be completed in one sitting. As the main character is immersed in the titular ocean-so will you in this wonderful story of love, loyalty and memory.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Affleck did an excellent job with this movie. His acting and directing are superb. I loved the story and this movie brought it to life.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|With all the games available for Android, few are worth keeping and playing all the time. This is one. A Keeper!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie was well acted and very enjoyable. For those unfamiliar with the book, it is a nice way to introduce it. I think the acting was excellent.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Although the change of perspective throughout the novel at times interfered with the flow of the story, it definitely added to the overall effect. I would definitely recommend this novel!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Great read. Fun and silly for good leisure reading. I would suggest this book to anyone and everyone. Can't wait to see what happens to Darcy in the next book
B00E66QPCG|2.0|The use of MACD, RSI and Bollinger Bands as described in this book dates back to the last century. Sure they work - sometimes. Profitable strategy? Far from it. And after all it is a come-on to the Rockwell Trading website, where you should drop some more money.<br />Instead, check out Tim Haddock, Day Trading with Heikin Ashi charts. This has improved my profitability noticeably already in the first week using his approach.<br />And he is one of the few not trying to sell you expensive indicators or webinars.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Game is best on our tablet, but I'm still enjoying it om my gs3.wish the energy lasted longer, that's why I am doing a reveiw, waiting to build up energy lol
140006922X|5.0|Once I'd heard the interview with Faux - I remembered how incredibly smart Aslan is and how much I wanted to read it - well worth the wait for publication.<br />Book in perfect condition.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Pretty fun game seems a little slow would be better if things didn't cost so much winning coins does match how fast you go through them
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|(September)<br />Data is taken in automatically, and it was convenient, however stopped operating after the beginning of using in three days.<br />Although used ordinarily, it has broken in three days.<br /><br />(October)<br />Support of Withings and amazon was good.<br />After Anazon exchanges for new Pulse, I am using comfortably new Pulse.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very entertaining and clever. Imagination reminiscent of Isaac Azimov  The ending left me slightly disappointed almost wishing it ended after the final battle
B002RI9UKE|4.0|The secret is a good read, the only thing missing is an exact step by step way of using it.<br /><br />I found the answer in [[ASIN:B00E3XMR6U Creative Mindshaping: Create A New You, Create A New Life. Inspired By The Olympics And Paralympics]]<br /><br />Creative Mindshaping helped me to apply the teachings in the secret very effectively.
1623420148|5.0|I abso-freakin-lutely loved, loved, LOVED this book! Every part of it was strong, held my attention, had me thinking about the story when I wasn't able to sit down and read it, and it never, ever, got boring. Definitely a two thumbs up and a huge 'effin smile on my face! Is it worth the read?  Hell yeah it is!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Useful info on the need to change our habits, but not complete.<br />I found a faster way to change habits was with [[ASIN:B00E3XMR6U Creative Mindshaping: Create A New You, Create A New Life. Inspired By The Olympics And Paralympics]]<br /><br />Creative Mindshaping helped me break bad habits, and create new,lasting habits.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I'm a big fan of Phantoml0rd and he uses this same headset, so sinply by watching him throw it around like a maniac and it still working fine i thought id grab it. Absolutely beautiful sound quality, decent mic quality, excellent wireless range and a 10 hour battery life (plus you can charge it while using it so you never have to worry). The only con i can think of is that the charger is only for a usb so your computer must be on to charge it. Other than that, great product.
0064471837|5.0|This series has great crossover appeal for adults as well as boys, which may not be obvious from the description since the main character is a girl.  As a librarian, I am always happy to steer fantasy lovers to these titles and no one has been disappointed by them.  The characterization is truly spectacular, and that is a deal-breaker for me.  A story can be wonderful but without that captivating character at the reins, it will fall flat; Sabriel is vibrant and real. Looking forward to the long-awaited Clariel, which will undoubtedly be worth the ten year wait.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|When I'm playing song pop with my co-worker I would like to beat her, but I can't because Shazam the paid verison takes forever to load.  It's okay to have if you are not in a hurry to get the song info.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Very disappointed. Most of the time, it was dark, it was slow, and it was boring. The acting was good, however the pace of the movie was not enough to keep me at \\"the edge of my seat.\\"
B00ESY77LO|5.0|It had everything!  Romance, pomp and circumstance, friendship, the mob, murder, tragedy etc.  DiCaprio was at his best!<br />What a great actor! When he loses his temper about 3/4 into the movie- wow!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author shows the human side and similarities between peoples...no matter what part of the world they hail from.<br />I feel this sort of book dispels some of the myths and fear people in the West hold about the Middle East, and I think that's a good thing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This does exactly what I need it for and I couldn't be happier!  I was especially pleased that it's a free app.  Good deal Kindle!<br />If you're looking for a calculator to do things such as balancing your check book etc., this is what you're looking for.  I do recommend it highly.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Ilove this singer/song writer. I love the acoustic versions of old songs, a cover of Thank You (love it) and previously unrecorded song(s)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great if you love horses you will love this game so get this game. You can have friends and get more horses
B000JCSPG0|4.0|Very good movie in this series I like very  Much. I recomend to evry one to see this movie a
B009EP3DJM|5.0|After the production of \\"Animal\\" and Cannibal\\" we might have believed to have seen all that Ke$ha to be capable of on the pop/dance music scene, but we'd be wrong. With the release of her 3rd album, \\"Warrior\\", it's like she has finally reached that nice sweet spot and coasting right into a solid album with a great song line up and diverse vocals. This album has energy, which when it comes to Ke$ha she just knows how to deliver it.<br /><br />I'm pretty confident to say that every single (yes, every single one) song is a great listen. That wasn't the case with \\"Animal\\" and certainly \\"Cannibal\\", which really was just a rehash of Animal's formula; at most those albums had a smattering of worthwhile tracks. Not the case here!<br /><br />Go ahead and give this release a shot. Enjoy!<br /><br />Personal Fave tracks:<br />Warrior, Thinking of You, Wherever You Are, Supernatural
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am so excited you got my game working again I had to restart playing all over again but I'm just happy its up and running. whatever you guys did in the update worked and the ball game is super awesome this time around.
B008LXZFH6|3.0|It's a nice way to pass the time, but I wouldn't say it is the most clever or funny of the genre.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin dozer is fun and It is sometimes hard so it is is good because this game is<br />Not like other games it is fun I like it but you should try things like<br />Survival craft and the simsons taped out and more
B00CKYHH6O|4.0|This season was also outsourced, but it's way more up to par with CBS Digital than what HTV did with Season 2.<br /><br />However, that being said, it's still not completely up to CBS Digital's remastering quality...<br /><br />I still give it a 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I haven't watched any bonus material with Season 4, so I can't comment on it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I had given up reading science fiction. Unfortunately, the genre attracts too many poor writers. This book changed my mind. I enjoyed the story and the style immensely. The characters are real enough that I care about them. The descriptions of the environment drew me in. I could imagine the worn treads on the stairs, and the wear and tear of generations, even the musty smell of the lower levels. The story starts slowly, describing people and things and making the world believable. As the action picks up it takes place in a fully developed environment with believable characters. I was honestly sorry to have finished it. It will make choosing my next book difficult. (Yes, I know he has more books, and I will come back to read more from Howey in the future, but not immediately.)<br /><br />There were a few typos \\"ran\\" when \\"run\\" was needed, and several instances of \\"timne\\". While those pulled me out of the story, it was easy to slink back in. Great book! Highly recommended.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The quality is once again, up to what I've come to expect from CBS Digital.<br /><br />The bonus material that comes with this release is awesome, from the gag reel to the tribute to David Rappaport.<br /><br />I give this a sold 5 stars.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Excellent book that gets the reader thinking about topics such as racism, equality, and the negative aspects of, &#34;sameness...&#34; I gave it 4 stars because I like a definitive ending, even if the author left the ending up to interpretation on purpose. I want the author to tie up the story and let me surmise other options on my own, not just leave things hanging.  Beyond that, very good for pre teens as well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was the most amazing book I've ever read! A must read! Wonder is a wonderful book!PLEASE please please read this book!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This game is flawless. Easy to learn. Hours of continuous fun .Online muliplayer or single player vs computer. Great strategy game.
140006922X|5.0|Dr. Aslan is a very good storyteller. You can read this book as if it were a novel, and I almost felt the smells of old Jerusalem. I have read a handful of other books on the same subject, and he basically discusses the same historical facts, but the other authors I have read are mainly Catholic scholars, and their framework for understanding Jesus seems more spiritual and less political. Dr. Aslan's political reading of the life of Jesus and the first two generations of disciples is very convincing.<br />There is only one thing I do not like about this book: I think his judgment of King Herod the Great is too harsh. I think that very controversial ethnarch deserved his epithet, because he really did a lot of good things for his country.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't believe they're was so much more book to go because I couldn't imagine what else could be said. And then it threw in a twist that you didn't see coming. Didn't want to put it down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app. puzzles are challenging  but not too hard.  easy to maneuver between zooms but only issue is when you enter part of a puzzle then double check the pattern what you entered goes away.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is very fun. It kinda like a way to make things with your  and imagination bring it to life on here. So cool
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really good game<br /> it is the best game ever I really recommend it  is better than triple run  the 1st and the 2nd one.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Enough of a who dun it to get your attention without being too repetitive.<br />Excellent interactive menu. I would recommend this game for every type of gamer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This it so freakin better than the first one there is more traps more skins more fun!<br />I would totally recommend buying it it's the bomb
B009AY04A8|2.0|The game is fun but has too many narratives! Another killer for this game is it lacks helpful hints. Chapter seven is very poorly explained and needs to be revamped! Glad I didn't pay to play!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is totally not a waste a money it's the best yet  you can spawn animals it's so FREAKIN amazing
B004M20YDU|5.0|Sweet Beats that coincide with the original!  Awesome Techno for any club or party!  Loved the Movie - Loved the soundtrack.  I highly recommend it!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Once I got into this story, I could not put it down.  Amazing!!!!! Excuse the pun.  Very clever story line.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|But not my last!  This game strikes a perfect balance between making me think hard and driving me crazy. It becomes difficult  slowly enough that I can build on my skills and keep winning. At first I thought  it might be boring,solving the same problem again and again. I was wrong. It's endlessly fascinating.
B000FC0ZEO|4.0|This was a nice ending to a great story.. Well written and a joy to read. I am glad that I found the rest..
B005ES1F4S|5.0|Make sure you try them on in a store before you internet purchase they run large. Wife got these and we have done 4 days in NY and she loves them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|&quot; This is food for the brain&quot;  it challenges you in a fun way so its not boring...you just can't stop... great entertainment for all ages!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|There was a lot of action and good special effects.  But I thought the plot was a little weak.  I would recommend it.
1583334386|2.0|same stuff just re-gurgitated.  Did not learn anything new.  And I've read a lot of self help books in my day.
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling skies has great characters and pretty good special effects.  Hope they don't run out of material. Lots of action and adventure.
1451627297|5.0|This books grabs you from the start and takes you on a time travelers ride to the past and back.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome you have survival and creative I love it soooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!:) it has spiters,zombies and scelatins. it has animals such as pigs, sheep's, cows and chickens. !!!!!:)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love this book. so glad someone put me on to it. would and have recommended it. this book wont disappoint.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I love the stackable feature that this calculator has. It is like my physical HP calculator that I have had for over 30 years. I would recommend it. It's free. Can't go wrong.
0307887898|1.0|The authors suggests to make a team of 5 people (this is a magic number he puts in his pseudo-science theory), who do all the work: talking to customers, marketing, sales, and programming. He contradicts himself saying that the system is important, not the people, but latter suggests to test the team by solving problems given at informatics competitions. His idea is that smart people (engineers who can solve IOI informatics problems) can learn quickly marketing and sales and do their job even better in the long run (which I think is true). The author does not see the big picture:<br />- A big team require special techniques to manage communication (read Code Complete by Steve McConnel). Eric Ries does not know how to manage big teams and instead suggests to limit the size to 5. This works only for very small projects.<br />- The IOI competition participants are all taken by Google, Microsoft, Facebook or start their own companies. Most corporations do not have talent. If there is a smart person she is thought to be crazy/disruptive<br />Eric Ries gives many examples with Toyota, including one about Toyota Sienna manager who visited all US states, Canada and Mexico to interview people. The author does not realize this is an anti-example for his lean theory of working in small batches: there is no reason to go in all 50 states to test your product assumptions as one is enough. And yet this is exactly what Toyota did.<br />Read other 1 and 2 star reviews, because they are all correct: Eric Ries is a vocal salesman, pitching his consulting business to corporations.
B007N85POS|5.0|I like this free version of Angry Birds. It is a nice change of pace from the original. I recommend it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Good storyline, great acting, hoping the next one comes out soon. Hopefully the next one will be a war with the Klingons.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|When I use a word like \\"thrilling,\\" I mean every damn letter of it. The incredible African-American musical talent Count Basie teamed up with that singing legend, the one of a kind Italian-American named Frank Sinatra. What a combo! Unbeatable. Don't deprive yourself; do not short-change your quest for unforgettable music.<br />Experience the creme de la creme.<br /><br />You won't be able to get enough of it.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Amazon has invited me to make a few comments on 'The Mission.'<br />I hope my words are not necessary.  For anyone interested in genuine<br />Catholic religiosity; for anyone interested in the meaning of unrestricted love<br />and transcendence beyond its too many naïve mythical trappings, this movie<br />is for you.  It is for you, further, if you wish insight into the collision between<br />such love and the distorted colonial interests of this world.  Again, should you be<br />interested in the conflicts and multitude of responses by different characters to<br />the outcomes of those conflicts, this movie is for you.  The movie is Not a 'Ben Hur'--<br />which is a wonder in its own way.  But this movie was written for what seems<br />to have been another epoch in our history and the history of the church....  For that,<br />it is all the more valuable.  Set some time aside if you haven't seen it.  With a screenplay<br />by Robert Bolt (do you remember 'A Man for All Seasons'?).  And supreme performances by<br />especially Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro but also by all involved.  (Including the<br />cinematography, music by Ennio Morricone and direction by Roland Joffe).  After the first 5 minutes<br />of the film, there is a rocky but needed run of about 15 minutes.  From there on, it's magnificent.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Yes. You see the image on the DVD box. And still cannot accept what your peepers are looking at.<br />It happened. He did it. Heavy planning and hard work went into it, but the son of a gun pulled off the<br />impossible!<br />The feat will leave you breathless. Can something like this even be possible? You'll be asking<br />yourself time and time again. . .while witnessing this little dude accomplish the dream of a<br />lifetime.<br /><br />To use an old and trite expression: WOW!<br />The word \\"awesome\\" was invented to describe what takes place here.
B000AOA2G8|4.0|It's a tool! It works just fine.<br />13 more words required. aaaaaaaaalmost done. seven more words to go go go.<br />There. done.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|Appreciate great singing?  You got it. Here it is. I've heard them all: BB King, Etta, Sinatra, Pavarotti, Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Il Volo, Englebert, Tom Jones, Meatloaf, Al Green, Aretha, Eva Cassidy, Michael McDonald, Glen Campbell, Bob Dylan, Nana Mouskouri, Barbara Lewis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Merle Haggard, Patsy Cline, Tricia Yearwood, Garth Brooks, Ronnie Milsap, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Martha Reeves, Diana Ross, Gene Pitney, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Bobby Darin, Sarah Brighton, ad infinitum. . .and appreciate every single one; and yet, having said as much, no one, NO ONE beats Elvis at his best. Nobody.<br /><br />One music lovers humble opinion.
B00CATONCA|5.0|We all love the show  or we wouldn't be here;<br /><br />this item was a added to my first \\"limited edition\\" season 2  (the Head with the screwdriver )<br /><br />my issues as of yet were simply,<br /><br />*it didn't come with batteries<br /><br />* if you don't own a mini Phillip screw driver  to unlock the place where batteries are held then you may need to borrow or go purchase one, or risk the chance of ruining your item with some other means of unscrewing it to open (don't recommend it)<br /><br />* Bobble Zombie Heads are Cool but I think some may not had been put on springs as well as they should have been , so them may seem off balance .<br /><br />* I don't recommend filling with water ONLY because it could rust the springs on the bobble heads, and if the plastic has any crack in tank it could leak ruin the battery house and rust of the insides and ruin any chance of lighting up, Also your season 3 DVD case etc.<br /><br />Other than that  I am Happy with my Item...and I'm looking forward to Season4 <3
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Different from the other two.  Each book had a different flavor.  This last one, sad but more provocative...a good last read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is great.  It really makes you think.  The creators really put some thought into this.  Challenging but not impossible.  Thank you for a fun and thought provoking app. Download it and enjoy.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|this knifeis everything I expected it to be! great construction, really sharp, able to keep an edge, comfortable on the belt-easy to carry. I got a great price through amazon.com: fast delivery and would recommend this knife as an extreme survival knife to anybody looking to get into bushcraft.

B009LQKHIO|2.0|I am really trying hard to get through this book and to like it, but the fact that almost every sentence is a separate paragraph is driving me nuts!  In fact around the 11% mark, one single word is its own paragraph.  The premise of the book sounds good, so I will keep trying and see if I can finish it. If I am able to finish it I'll come back and update my rating.<br /><br />.
B005HEK3JW|3.0|basically 3 stars is that max that can be given for any video in the prime library regardless how  good it is for the following reasons.<br />1.  if a movie or show receives too high of a ratting amazon will pull the video from being a free amazon prime video  to one you have to pay for. (see this happen several times)<br />2. no app to watch videos on other android tablets. there are those of use that require and need the use of a full featured android tablet over the heavily modified kindle fire tablet that lack in the advanced capabilities that an unaltered version of android os is capable of. and despite other android tablets has either the same or higher resolution  than the kindle fire hd.(kindle fire is only good for watching video, reading books and a few apps. full android is more like a hand held laptop)<br />3. for the piece you pay for amazon prime membership there should be a lot more videos free if not all of them. at the moment for 8 bucks a month you'll get a lot more movies, shows to watch with netflix, plus netflix streams in HD to all tablets, computers and devices not just certain ones like amazon.<br />i wont be renewing my amazon prime membership and will be keeping netflix
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I usually buy Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling books as soon as they hit the shelves but for some reason this book did not interest me.  I decided I might miss something important if I did not read it so I bought it.  It was Great!

B005UKK4Y2|5.0|Both my husband and I really liked this movie. It was so preposterous it was hysterical.  It also moved along quickly, so no time to get bored.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This movie is powerful, very moving, and brilliant sports-pic-cum-family drama. Great acting by Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte. Warrior goes the distance. I would highly recommend this movie.
B00C8YOIR2|4.0|This is not your average ghost story. This takes the concept of a medium - someone who can speak to the dead - and flips it around, giving a ghost the ability to speak to the living.<br /><br />The main character May is an elderly hermit who seems to generally hate people. She's not thrilled about being dead, obviously, but she's even less happy about having to act as an intermediary between the other ghosts she meets and the living.<br /><br />May has some of the best quips about the people around her, and there is a certain quirky humor in the narrative that reminds me of those British comedy shows on the BBC. I won't get too much into how the plot plays out, because that is something you need to enjoy for yourself, but I can assure you that you will enjoy it.<br /><br />This is definitely going to be a story that I revisit often!<br /><br />**I received a copy in exchange for a fair review.**
B000TENE6Y|1.0|...at least this is what my girlfriend said.<br />Ok, i do understand the psychedelic music, i love strong lyrics that hits you right away, emotional, down the spiral...but this is crap.<br />Way to much whining, Thom York voice sometimes sounds just like a women screaming when she sees a spider...<br />Yes, i do like Pablo Honey, The Bends, but c'mon man...this is bad.<br />If i want to hear something deep i'll play R.E.M.<br />Radiohead ....good as alternative rock, not this whining ''machine''.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey comes across as a thoroughly nice person. Her humor is searingly funny, but not mean or spiteful. In spite of her extraordinary talent, she seems grounded and not removed from her middle-class origins. laughed out loud again and again. She demystifies life behind the scenes in the entertainment industry without 'taking on airs'. At the same time she intimates that there are funnier stories that she's too much a lady to tell!
B000WDROYK|5.0|Black Book takes the audience to occupied Holland in the Second World War. Evil abounds and many people play both sides of the fence, each for their own reasons. Director Paul Verhoeven directs a masterful piece here. He begins with a Jewish woman hiding in an attic. After the house is accidentally destroyed, she's on the run, only to find herself double-crossed in an escape attempt with her family, all of whom are massacred. Assuming a new name, she infiltrates German headquarters by becoming a girlfriend of sorts to the local military chief. In the mean time, she helps the resistance with various acts that put her in mortal danger. The trouble for our heroine, and everyone else, is that this is war. Life and death are everywhere. Ambitions become lethal on both sides as German officers undermine each other while resistance fighters make deals with the devil. There are enough twists and turns in this plot to sustain it all the way through its two hour plus length. Along the way, there are several \\"convenient\\" coincidences, but the acting and directing are stunningly good, erasing any pretense of Hollywood connivance. Thus, you're in for a serious film that studies human frailty as much as the horrors of war. Verhoeven knows how to make a brilliant movie, and this is one of his best. Supported by a brilliant cast, fine camera work, beautiful sets, and a labyrinthian plot, he delivers what we sorely need in cinema, a director that knows what he's doing.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I knew nothing about this recording studio and found myself fascinated.  The person who did the editing is very good at combining images and interviews so you have a sense of the past as these people experienced it.  Very nice.

B003U6BE8I|2.0|The movie departed pretty far from the book, to its detriment for the most part.  Plus, the  acting was really not good, especially Percy.  A, terrible waste of Sean Bean&#34;s talent, as well.  I also cannot begin to understand why Pierce Brosnan took on such a ridiculous role as Chiron.<br />Quite a disappointment.

The DVD did not have the frantic two second cuts and scene changes you are used to seeing. I could get lost in the performance, it made me feel like I was in the audience, seeing it live. Dido is a beautiful, captivating performer who doesn't seem to carry the large ego of others.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|The saving grace for this book is that it returns to some of our favorite viewpoint characters: Jon, Dany, Tyrion etc. There is a lot more action to the plot of this installment, and the reader can feel the stage being set for a grand finale (which is allegedly occurring over the next two novels, set to be released sometime before the armageddon).<br /><br />There are a few issues with this book, which I've come to expect from the series. The first relates to Martin's epilogue from book four in which he explains that A Dance with Dragons will go back and tell the story of other characters during the events of A Feast for Crows. The issue is simple: this is not true. Chronologically, this book catches up with its predecessor only about one third of the way through, leaving the reader confused about the order of events in the two books.<br /><br />Martin continues with the irritating addition of trivial viewpoint characters. Without revealing any spoilers, the biggest failure of this book is its refusal to deal with integral action. There are a few happenings that are built up to be major events, and when they actually occur the reader is instantly disappointed with their anticlimactic treatment.<br /><br />Overall, this novel is worth the read for entertainment's sake, and (if you're like me) you are already hooked on the series anticipating the finale. However, if you were hoping (also like me) that Martin's writing took a turn for the better at this point in the series, it didn't.

B00A0SLTCU|1.0|This is one of those movies that I am going to buy again in 20 years.  It is so hilariously bad, that I will be compelled to watch it again just to make sure that is actually as bad as I remember.  The first total recall was very creative.  This remake is not.  The high point of this movie is the most boring car chase scene you have ever watched.  I honestly had to reflect and figured out how they pulled it off.  They have good CGI, explosions, and capable drivers.  It hit me towards the end of the movie.  Whoever wrote this movie has a thing for elevators, an incredibly dull machine.  While you watch, count how many times they escape by running into an elevator, and the doors slowly close.  Or they almost get blown up in an extremely slow moving elevator.  Oh my god... oh my god.  The whole movie, is an ode to elevators.  I swear - please you must watch this movie to vindicate me.  Everything, even the main form of transport, is an elevator.  There is an elevator in the car chase scene - as in the cars go onto an elevator.  This movie was sooo sooo painfully boring that I am grinning ear to ear as I write this review and I can't help but to be glad that I saw it.

B00BEMTP6I|1.0|Just to paint a kind of scenario, I made my purchase from Argentina sending this product to a friend´s house in Miami. This friend, who visites me once a year, came with this and other products (puchased at Amazon too) just to leave them with me. He gives me my long awaited Curtains and...SURPRISE!!! The CD is a copy or not even that, it´s kinda inkjet printed homemade CD!!!! It has no serial number, the case isn´t its original one,etc,etc<br />Actually there´s nothing more to add than the product that you (Amazon.com) delivered is just a sort of CD - R homemade manufactured by Amazon product and not the original Audio CD. Yes...there´s somethin to add: the jewelcase also came broken.<br /><br />Just to be clear i ´ll like to add that the review has nothing to do with John´s album (wich is great by the way). Amazon.com: don´t be just a bunch of thieves!!! It ´s hard to beleive that you downloaded this via torrent and printed it i don´t know were just to keep the delivery schedule in time....but actually it´s true!!!<br />It would have been more honest just to send an E mail telling me that the product wasn´t in stock anymore togive me time to cancel the operation....!!!

B00B4Z5J92|4.0|You've got to hand it to Dave Grohl. The guy is a rock 'n' roll renaissance man who gives every different project his all in a genuinely passionate way that rubs off on others. The review I read about \\"Sound City\\" after it came out wasn't all that flattering, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's a quality movie, with a solid soundtrack to accompany it. Grohl obviously has the connections to interview hugely successful artists, and that's what he does. I like how he sits back and lets others tell a large part of the tale, drawing out vivid behind-the-scenes descriptions of a proudly analog world.<br /><br />Sound City Studios -- and its soundboard, an instrument unto itself -- was once a dilapidated recording mecca for some of the most famous artists and albums of all time. As the diverse slew of rockers and studio employees personally relate the place's history and ups and downs, you can't help but hope that the good, organically created music will continue to be churned out forever. It isn't, of course, but Grohl, in an amazingly endearing way, helps makes sure that at least a part of the studio's history lives on. (I won't give away what he does.)<br /><br />The movie glosses over the 1980s heavy metal bands that recorded at Sound City rather quickly, which is too bad. Still, it relates in detail the musical transition during that time to compact discs, drum machines, sequencers, synthesizers and the infancy of digitally created sounds. As if to offset this wave of technology, Grohl makes his presence felt on the other side of the camera, collaborating with classic artists on new music (with a remnant from Sound City Studios).<br /><br />From Trent Reznor and Paul McCartney to Stevie Nicks and former Nirvana bass player Krist Novoselic (who it was great to see), \\"Sound City\\" comes alive with music that feels both spontaneous and professional. Watching artists like Reznor, McCartney, Grohl, Nicks, Josh Homme and Rick Springfield hammer out compositions is a real treat, and it proves that talent and camaraderie beat out Pro Tools and digitized playback any day of the week.<br /><br />For Grohl, the story touchingly turned out to be a full-circle experience that he relates with both glee and a sentimental heart. Rock fans will like this heartfelt story.ns is a real treat, and it proves that talent and camaraderie beat out Pro Tools and digitized playback any day of the week.<br /><br />For Grohl, the story touchingly turned out to be a full-circle experience that he relates with both glee and a sentimental heart.

B002LANLDK|3.0|I saw this movie as part of a series marathon, and I felt like this was one of the lesser ones which definitely leaves you wanting for more. I think you might want to watch this only if you intend to marathon the entire series, but not by itself.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The best movie I'd watch in a long time. Original screen play. I definitely recommend. If you liked Sixth Sense you will like this movie.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|True to the original. Played on both 1st gen Nexus7 and Galaxy S4. Bigger screen makes it a bit easier to play, but definitely not necessary. I'm glad it came up as the FAOTD otherwise I never would have known about it. I would definitely pay the asking price for this game.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|Lee Majors has always been a very handsome man and a very good actor. This series started slow with, I think, too many pilot movies, one of which we are better off forgetting. In my opinion Lee Majors abilities pulled it through the early episodes and by the end of the season it had found it's nitch. It has a little bit of everything, making it interesting for the whole family.<br />If you have never watched it I think by the end of the season you will be hooked!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Learn about extroverts and introverts with this book.  Enjoyed it, hope you do too.  I'm an introvert so it was interesting to see some of the similarities.
B00DLKXF3A|2.0|I should preface this review by stating that I am not some metalhead that only likes blazing fast tempos and the heaviest possible sound.  I like all of Avenged Sevenfold's albums going back to City of Evil and while their sound has changed over the years, they have always delivered a unique sound complemented by layers of complexity and driven by melodic progressions.  But you're not going to find any of that on Hail to the King.  Instead, they scaled back everything that made them great to create a much more subdued and ultimately uninspired album.  What's left is a sound that is very derivative of Metallica with predictable melodies and overly simplistic song structures.  I think it would be fair to call this an attempt at a metal pop album, which I wouldn't be opposed to except for the fact that recent pop songs have more dynamics and greater variation between songs than this album.<br /><br />After bashing the album, I feel that it is only fair that I go over some of the good points.  The production quality is outstanding: the rhythm guitars are thick and driving, the acoustic guitars cut through the rhythm guitars perfectly, and the drums have never sounded better.  There are also some cinematic parts that sound on par with the best effects in the movie industry.  The engineer(s) really spent some time putting a lot of polish into this album - it's just a shame that the band didn't put as much effort into the songwriting process.<br /><br />As other people have stated, the rhythm section has suffered the most during this album.  All of the beats are drastically dumbed down to the point that it sounds like the band programmed a drum machine loaded with samples of Metallica's black album.  I can understand the band's desire to scale things back on the drums after playing several years with an overplaying showoff like Portnoy but I think they took it way too far.  They should have kept Portnoy as a studio drummer and used a less attention-seeking drummer for tours.<br /><br />Finally, I know there will be some diehard fans that love the new album and will call me and any other dissenters \\"haters\\".  The simple fact is that I really like this band and I didn't think it was possible for them to write any songs that I would dislike, let alone a whole album.  But every song on this album can't even compare to the b-sides of previous albums.  The only song that I actually did like was the bonus song, St. James.  While much of the song was predictable, it still had that classic A7X energy on top of beautiful melodies.  My hope is that the band listens to all of the criticism with an open mind and writes some more inspired songs for their next album.  It wouldn't have to sound like any of their previous albums to please most fans - it should just be more energetic with attention to dynamics and should maintain a style that makes A7X more than just some mediocre metal band.
