B0037DGH4A|4.0|Bought this as a replacement. Original purchased years ago when it first came out. Love it so much couldn't be without it!
6303481272|5.0|because I leave the best and the guy deserves a good rating.<br />I really like this movie its a long time since I seen it so I had to get it again.<br />I recommend you to anybody that likes anime as much as I do.<br />so thanks again you deserve 5-stars.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Can't wait to watch the movie now. It was nice being able to picture the characters while reading the book.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|A group of drug reps told me about it and I expected it to be a comedy about all the flirty adventures of drug reps. Instead it was a very touching story about what it really means to love someone.  It wasn't preachy just well done. i<br />Would recommend it.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|You always pick up a new Le Carre novel, intrigued as to what he will find to apply his deep understanding of espionage and the shadow practices of Britain's security forces, now that that the Cold War is consigned to the history of past generations.  This novel is set within the Foreign Office (FO), and weaves together the strands of a story, told over the course of three to four years, where a young and aspiring staffer is attached to a wayward Minister, who engages private security forces to undertake a mission, under the cover of National Security.  There is no doubt in the reader's mind that the events that have transpired were not truly in the national interest, and the tension that Le Carre manages to generate throughout the narrative is every bit as gripping as those of the plots in the Smiley novels.  It seems that the tradecraft practiced by FO officers continues to be practiced, but increasingly against multiple and different targets, some of whom are within the British Government itself.  The overall effect is a chilling expose of what can occur when there is too little scrutiny applied to practices justified in the name of maintaining security.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wow!  What a beautifully crafted and acted show...start to finish.  Why on earth did we ever move across the pond?
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Last night I wanted to take a break in my movie watching. Too many of my movies of late have been crime stories, action movies, war stories, and things of that sort. Murder, mayhem, gunfire, explosions and  foul language seem to dominate. I have nothing against this type of entertainment, in fact, I njoy it. However I needed a break. I found \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" on a five-dollar DVD rack and bought it. The movie was rated G and I only seldom watch G-rated movies.<br /><br />Okay, this is a really  simple dog story that originated in Japan in the 30s and was brought and adapted to the US. It might be simple, but keep your hanky within reach. An Akita puppy was sent to a railway station, probably in New England,  the shipping crate was broken and the small dog wandered about the station until discovered by a professor (Richard Gere). It was late and Gere tried to fix things but couldn't so he  took the dog home on a temporary basis. The next day he continued to try and rid himself of the puppy, but you all can probably guess what happened. He ended up adopting the beautiful little dog.<br /><br />Well, the first half of the movie consists of the lost dog, the finding of the dog and the adoption and the gradual assimilation of the dog (Hachi) into the lives of Gere, his wife (Joan Allen) and their family. Not much excitement. The man and dog bond became stronger and stronger. To best understand and enjoy the story, it would probably be best if you had such a bond at some time in your life, but that isn't necessary. At about the mid-point in the movie, Gere suddenly died in his classroom. From there on Hachi is the leading actor. It's a simple story of deep love and devotion, and remember, keep that box of tissues handy.<br /><br />This is a really simple, really well done film that packs an emotional wallop second to none. I'm amazed it hasn't gathered more attention. It's the best  dog story I've ever watched.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B008M721MS|5.0|wow I really love it! Very user friendly Great value great support.The ease of dealing with amazon gives one piece of mind.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised by this film. The stigma of mental health issues and yet the love and support of a family and a young woman who deserved that Academy award. The parts were all well cast! superb film!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This cd is great music.  Rod did it again great songs, I missed all the years gone by with no new ones.  I recommend this cd, you will love the songs.
B0071AKB38|5.0|Excellent sound with very good bass and small enough to carry anywhere. Easy to charge and Bluetooth with provided cords and nice carrying bag. Fast shipping Thanks 22
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the books in the series, they are good relaxing reads. This is not a stand-alone book, I believe reading only this book out of order would not be fulfilling. The Clifton family keeps on finding people to hate them and the family is just so nice the reader keeps rooting for them. I did get to a point where I reminded myself that fiction is suspending disbelief, the plot became too much to really believe. When I read book one I believed that this was to be a trilogy, obviously another book is coming and I really don't like the continuing saga without each book having a real ending, it feels like a marketing ploy somewhat like season finales on tv. Unfulfilling ending that really is unfair to the reader.  Instead of feeling I can't wait for the next story I hope the next book finishes this one. I will get it from the library as I feel ripped off buying this one.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Enjoyable -Great story about an extraordinary Horse.<br />Whether the story is true or fiction it does honor the Great Triple Crown winner.<br />It brought back great memories (and if memory serves me correct I think we saw it on Black and White TV)<br />To have actually seen Secretariat run was shear joy.  He was a beautiful, strong, animal with a stride that was unbelievable to watch and this movie covers the heart of the horse and well as the faith of his owner.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|kinda monotonous. kinda dont see what i a m working toward?not bad,but too much just doing the same thing over and over,not very challenging. but,not a bad game,just not for me.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great game so addicting and a hint is to not waist any of ur gems no matter how pong u have to wait
B004XZR63M|4.0|Great book to challenge the conventional way of thinking about money, a great read, easy and aplicable read for everyone
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love that you can find anything you are looking for on this site...old, new, patterns....weird things, bulk items...has it all!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I thought it was very difficult to understand as it was written with a great deal of medical technology.  I tried to skim over all that and read more about what it was like in heaven.  I enjoyed &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;  a lot better.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Get way to pass the time and get the ole brain moving....fun for all ages...more people need to engage in this activity!
B000059ZLH|5.0|THE MUSIC ON THE STUDIO VERSION WAS AMAZING. WHAT WAS MORE AMAZING: THE DVD PERFORANCE WAS PRACTICALLY NOTE FOR NOTE. TOO MANY MUSICIANS TRY TO IMPROVE THE MUSIC WHEN THEY PERFORM LIVE. BUT NOT ON THIS ONE.
B00CDXOXB4|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much. The movie lacked a lot. Acting was not very good at all. Disappointed with this movie.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Alway love this game. Have been playing it every chance I get. Love that I was able to get it on my Kindle Fire since I never go anywhere without my Kindle. Now I can play Mahjong any time I want.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. Very quick read. I couldn't wait to see the movie, then when it I saw the movie it was a big disappointment.<br />Read the book its great. Skip the movie.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|As a fan of the movie Momento, I was drawn to the premise of this book. It has a slow start for the first few pages, but then it rolls along with twists and turns so you don't know who to believe. Well worth the read.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I read the book and followed what they said but I only lost 2 pounds and that was it. The diet is easy enough to stick to and I really wasn't that hungry on my fast days. I don't know how people can say they eat and drink whatever they want on the non-fast days. I lost more weight doing 2 fast days ate very low calorie low fat on the other days.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|This is a great sound track.  It bring to mind all the little intimate moments that this frequently funny and witty movie brings.  I could just see the Holmes on that tiny pony!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|I never had trouble when I saw the name of this writer. Ever since The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1964) i knew that anything written by Le Carre will be a fantastic read. The latest is by no means different. In a way it is similar to Tailor of Panama and perhaps Absolute Friends, but it is a classic Le Carre and a book that will entertain you, and also make you think about the industry that is a topic of most of his novels: intelligence community.
B0081336FO|5.0|Even though there are only 3 episodes, they are brilliant and mind-blowing. I still rewatch episodes and see new things and grow to love the series more and more.
B003XRELEI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much.  It reminded me of much beloved Tom Robbins.  Whimsical, thought provoking, insightful, humorous and on and on.  A fun, easy book to read.  I loved it and have put it in my &#34;read again&#34; list.
B008BU70HW|2.0|If you are a devote Downton Abbey fan and have seen all the series and shows, do not buy this book. It is a basic overview of what you already know. I wanted to read something I didn't know. Wait for the next series if there ever is one?
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I did like this movie.  It was sweet even though I thought the acting lacked something.  Steve Martin was the only one who cussed from what I could tell.  I enjoyed the story because it was so related to real birding.  I learned some things, if they are really true, about locations and birds!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this freaking game its cool awesome Rudy I'm just making stuff up to fill up this list dang
B000W6Q1KU|5.0|The state of healthcare in this country should have been decided years ago.  Canada has a great example for us, as does most of Europe.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|If not for the very good cast and the acting - especially from Crowe - I wouldn't have even given it a 3 star.To many Although the storyline -the political aspect - was pretty believable there were many parts that were not. I would recommend waiting for it to get to cable T.V.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I like Paul Rudd. But this is the first movie I've seen him work at being funny.  This movie was trying so hard to be Knocked Up II and all it could manage was to be shrill and obnoxious. There were very brief moments of funny, but overall, it just fell flat.  Don't bother.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. I'm getting better all the time! Great time filler with fun,.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My son and I loved playing this together! We were excited and sad to have completed it so soon. Can't wait for your next game :)
B00AIBZM40|4.0|This is definitely my favorite type of movie...the kind where things go bump in the night. And in this particular flick there are some really good bumps. Ever since Pan's Labyrinth I've been a big fan of Guilermo Del Toro, and with Mama he doesn't disappoint. The acting is first rate by all those involved (including the children). The ending even came as a surprise to me (I thought I had it all figured out). If you like your every day slice and dice films, or are are a fan of Freddy, Michael or Jason then this probably isn't your cup of tea. On the otherhand if you'd like some good old fashioned scares, then Mama is calling your name. And what Mama wants - Mama gets.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased another workout from the Firm for $100 promising the same thing this $9 DVD.  However, I got fewer results from the completed 30 program of the Firm workout than did in 1 week with the 30 day shred.  Both say in 20 minutes a day you can get results.  30 day shred actually worked.  I will say the first workout is hard but not impossible. I had been doing the other workout for 30 days and this first workout was still challenging enough to to show results.  Very pleased.  Will be purchasing more of her DVDs now.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is best. Love playing it all the time. The suits are incredable plus its really easy to play. It just takes a little time to load on your device.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Dexter's life is becoming unbelievably complicated and his situations less and less credible. It creates a good tension, but I am actually happy to see the police are getting on to him as no one should be able to as charmed in life as he has ben until now. And frankly, the way he is behaving with Deb now that she knows about him has taken the shine off his personality for me. &#34;Isaac&#34; is the best character they've had on the show until now, however, in my opinion, and ANYTHING with Yvonne Strahowsky (sp?) in it is worth the watch just to gaze on her!
B000LTAY1U|2.0|PROs:<br />+Great Looking Watch for the Price. A comparable watch would run you $100-$150 more and the design and quality would be marginally better. The olive face and band work very well with more rugged/outdoorsy or field military looks.<br />+Automatic Movement<br /><br />CON (and it is a BIG one...):<br />-The watch worked perfectly fine in the first two months of wear. It is a very inexpensive automatic and if you do not wear it for a day and a half or two, the watch stops. Understandable. You get what you pay for. AFTER two months....the watch simply cannot hold time. I can wear the watch all day long and within half an hour of setting it down, the watch stops. Imagine how frustrating that is when you're trying to set, and reset the date on the watch.
B0026QCHOI|5.0|HD was great but disclaimer stated that it may reduce quality due to slow bandwidth,wondered if they were still going to charge me for HD if they did that?
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Another example of why I continue to read Michael Connelly.  He never fails to captivate his audience with writing that makes it hard to put down the book.
B00A81NFAS|2.0|Some funny lines, good performance by Jennifer Lawrence, also some interesting social commentary. Great ipod/iphone product placement, and somewhat disjointed dance-contest subplot and some of the dialogue and narrative flow left it at a 4.9 on a 10 pt scale for me, which I'll round down to 2/5.
B00BX50UEC|3.0|This year, the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) is organized in Sweden, but not in Stockholm. Instead, the city of Malm&ouml; in Scania has gotten the perhaps questionable honour of hosting this major pseudo-event. Daft, goofy, entertaining, crypto-gay...with a cult factor close to 100%, the ESC has it all. Like everyone else in Sweden, I grew up with this contest and just can't stop watching it, although I recently managed to cut down my consumption of snacks and candy associated with the event. Let me also say that the ESC doesn't really work on CD. It should be watched live on television! But sure, if you have a really weird taste in music, perhaps the official Eurovision album might suit you just fine.<br /><br />Here are some of the highlights this year. The \\"ding dong\\" song from Finland, which sounds like sexist trash but turns out to be lesbian propaganda. As a contrast, Switzerland, represented by a band called The Artists Known as Salvation Army. And yes, they really are members of the Salvation Army! Romania, proving that Count Dracula can sing opera in falsetto. Greece, performing a song about the Greek crisis - it's called \\"Alcohol is free\\". Armenia is represented by a worthless song written by an ex-member of Black Sabbath. Alcohol is free, yes? Meanwhile, the singer of the Ukraine is carried on stage by Igor, the tallest man in the United States (and, I suppose, the Ukraine). If you listen very, very attentively, you might also run into...Bonnie Tyler. Yes, really!<br /><br />But, as I said, this works best live on stage. Not on CD. How many stars? No idea. Three?<br /><br />Incidentally, I'm writing this two hours before the grand finale, and have no good idea who will win the contest. But then, the ESC winner is really an afterthought to the rest of the show...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I Loved it.  Can't wait for season 4.  Got hooked after first episode.  Costumes are magnificent and everything is so accurate historically.  Loved the specials at the end of each disc.
B004X80QNG|4.0|It's a very useful organizational tool for your smartphone. I think it has a lot more features than I need but it's nice to have options available.<br /><br />The Google Market has this on version 2.19 but this one is on 2.18<br />Will Amazon users see the updated version anytime soon?
B0079XPUOW|5.0|What is not to like about a Star Trek-ish dual dimensional action book?! I read through this book in 7 hours! It truly is a page turner. You won't be disappointed, promise. Enjoy!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Fun for kids, and still interesting enough for the adults accompanying them!<br /><br />We saw this with our older kids when they were little, and it is still great for our youngest!
B007N0REX6|5.0|A lot of bands, new and old, have attempted to bring back the feeling of 80's rock. This is the first album that I've listened to in awhile that sounds like it could fit into that original genre. It's refreshing to get some new, classic sounding metal. Slash has still got it.
0937381888|5.0|This book is excellent for anyone who wants to brew or is a brewer. It'll teach you everything you need to know to get started, including building equipment, to more advanced brewing techniques. Some of the chapters are definitely advanced and, unless you're a math geek, you may not retain much, but it's there or reference when you're ready.<br /><br />This is a must have book.
1451695195|5.0|I recently lost my husband at a young age.  It was unimaginable.  This book helped comfort me and come to terms with death.  It also sent me on a longer journey to understand consciousness and awareness.  Incrediable book a must read fo all.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  I am a huge Beatles fan and it was so cool to watch a movie that puts all their songs together to make one story. Now I know the meaning of these songs are not what was portrayed in the movie, but the way they could collaborate them to make a single story was awesome. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to any Beatle fan.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|about slavery.  They could had left that sailing ship<br />out.  It served no purpose and was boring.  Had they done more with the futuristic segment, this would have been a great movie.  That is where all of the<br />excitement was.  The rest was boring.  Hanks did<br />a superb job of acting out the different characters, he is truly multi-talented.  When are they going to put<br />slavery in the past and stop being other people over<br />the head with it?  It's time to move on.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Mount your MAGLIGHTS up and out of the way. A perfect way to never misplace your MAGLIGHT.<br /><br />Awesome price and very handy to have. Thanks
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Just got done reading the first volume of this comic and have enjoyed the ride all the way through. I haven't read a great comic like this in so long! This is a great buy for those new an  old. Can't wait  to read the next volume. :) Five stars in my book.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and The Fall of Giants. Can't wait for the next one to come out next year!
B009NLC1D6|5.0|It demonstrated what a man of faith can do. Gandhi would have made a wonderful Christian, but he was treated poorly by those who claimed to be Christian.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Omb I totally love this game its kinds like snuffs village you build your own reef and make it colorful and pretty I think its super fun and I love to play it
0684857219|4.0|has information about anything regarding physical fitness in general. definitely a must have for anybody looking to improve their physique
B0076DELIG|4.0|Typical Michael Connelly fare.  A good read for people who like Harry Bosch.  I recommend this to mystery readers of police procedures.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Had never played this game before, but I am totally hooked now. My grandchildren like to play it. Thank you for such a wonderful game.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It's interesting, has a ton of play options. No money required to advance and have nicer things.<br />It does get challenging at level 7
B002BIULQ2|5.0|IT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME I WAS LOOKIN FOR THE CLIMB MOVIE? BUT CANT FIND IT
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show with believable characters, an exciting plot and decent character growth. Can't wait for the 3rd season must watch for any lover of farscape, Star Gate, x-files

0385523912|5.0|The offcial governamental organizations ( UN, FAO, Red Cross and etc) estimate the oll of the1990's famine from 300 thousand to 4 million. That is how little information and acctual knowledge gets aout from North Korea. I am sure that the future will demonstrated some inaccuracies, but the light that it shreds into that darkness is both invaluable and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Hopefully this regime will eventually collapse. One can only hope that it will be sort of be &#34;defused&#34; before it goes out into a big and tragical &#34;bang&#34;.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|SO COOL!! I play this game atleast 4 or 5 times every 2 hrs. So if you like Mario, you are going to love this!
1935597760|2.0|I also don't understand all the great reviews for this book. I have made it up to Chapter 13 and I think I am done reading it. It puts me to sleep. It is very slow going, always the sense that surely something more will happen, must happen but... it doesn't.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is the only murder mystery that I watch on a consistent basis.  That's because it is unique, romantic without being to revealing.  A hint of romance is necessary but almost raw romance is nauseating and unnecessary and should be kept private.  The most important thing about Castle is the humor and family aspect. Everybody that has come to my house when Castle is on continues to watch it when they go home.  I love the whole comradery thing that is going on with the entire team, they are very orchestrated with breaking into a crime scene. One goes up the stairs first, points the gun and then the next one passes that one and so on and so on.  I like it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|nice game. great graphics. soothing background music and good story line. plus its free!<br />what could be better than free?
0307730697|5.0|Not really sure what to say about Adam Brown.  Mr. Blehm shared the good and bad just as Mr. Brown requested.  By the end of the book, I had two very strong emotions.  First, was the deep sadness for the loss of a great man who loved his God, his country, his family and his brothers in the SEALs and military.  Conversely, the other emotion was great joy.  Mr. Brown had a great faith in his God and believed that he was doing the right thing.  The joy came from knowing that he had this strong<br /> faith.<br /><br />This book would be good for the parent of a kid struggling with the choices facing them.  The book shows a good kid who got mixed up with the wrong crowd but still ended up a great man.
193700788X|5.0|Charlaine Harris does it again! I was sorry to learn that this is the last book in the series but Charlaine delivers action, excitement, adventure, romance, mystery, you name it-it is here! It is a delightful read that you will keep you reading and I am about to read it for the second time. I can't praise this book enough!
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|Nor is it likely to be like any other movie you see this summer.<br /><br />Terence Malick, to his credit, loves women, and graceful women who for the most part know how to move in space, especially in Nebraska or wherever there are fields with golden sun.  These women, Rachel McAdams and Olga Kurylenko look really nice in juxtaposition with Ben A, but the camera is usually on them, which is a good thing,  These women look good with empire waists although these women would look OK in Kmart too.<br /><br />Mont St Michel is really beautiful.<br /><br />I wish love were like this, but it was never for me, and that is why the magic of cinema is a romantic gift that Mallick has.  He has a great ear for music.  Music also moves the film; in fact, the film is composed rather than shot.  Each scene is a fugue.<br /><br />He also clearly loves America<br /><br />He has a terrific lens on his camera that can make anyplace, even a crappy gas station in the plains of the country look good, and somehow makes everything look really clean and uncluttered.  THis makes the characters central.<br /><br />Javier Bardem is a priest with a crisis of faith.  We watch him minister while interior monologue creates his stress.<br /><br />This film is for people who love cinematography, not acting, and possess a vague, universal story line with which to work.  I have always liked Malick, and he has expanded the scene from Days of Heaven when Brooke Adams sneaks out to see Richard Gere and they cavort in a small stream.  And the champagne glass falls underwater. Little was said then; the sin concocted.<br /><br />I find it thrilling to watch a new romantic type of filmmaking come about,whether you agree with the sentiment. It is not for everybody.  Especially not for someone named Pepper Potts.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's Winter of the World does a great job of walking us through the key historic events leading up to and through WWII. The added bonus is seeing it through the various national perspectives of Russians, Germans, Americans, and the British. It has made me want to delve much deeper into many of the historic moments that shaped our modern political world.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|THis is a great addition to my collection of Xmas  music.  I love the tenors.  What a great combination of voices.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|At first the set up of the story seemed really good... And most of the buildup seemed good... But then it turned fairly standard and very predictable towards the end. There was some really cool visual effects and parts were very scary but overall it seems that it could've been much more...bummer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is realy nice the picture is good and it is easy to play overall it is a veryfun and dose not take allatt of time. :-)*_*
B005KP778S|5.0|I had very low expectations for this movie as I didn't know much about it. This is really a fun goodhearted and funny movie for adults and kids believe it or not :-)<br /><br />My son and I have watched it together often... It's one of our go to movies!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Glad these are still available. I hate when a company stops supporting their own stuff. Thanks for having these for us die-hard old camera users who won't be upgrading anytime soon!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|loved this app in the beginning but not all that happy with the upgrade. I find it hard to use. like the older version better. but do love the snapshot.
034580404X|5.0|The was the best price around. And the books was amazing to read very interesting and very fun when other have read them and just talk about it together.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Bought this for my wife. she used to watch this as a child and this brought her back to that time. She was thrilled and very happy.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|It is quite impressing. I am wondering whether the documentary could reflect the real passion of Jiro.<br />Highly recommended to everyone!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Sure, the graphics aren't the best, but that's the point! This game is wicked addictive! If you grew up playing on an Atari 2600, this is a game you'll enjoy playing!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This movie has many layers and the subjects are handled very sensitively. Very interesting to see Nev's personal journey and his creativity.
B00821OX98|2.0|You have seen this show a dozen times before in one form or another.  There is no truly original interpretation or original idea that would make me recommend this show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Such a great way to organize the things you love! I love interest and the app makes it even more convenient.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Great game, lots of fun for the entire family.  Great way to help your kids learn while they just think they are playing a game. I love all word/puzzle games and this is one of my favorites by far.  Would highly recommended this to people of all ages. Helps to relieve stress after a hard work day and it was free, so you can't go wrong.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Spoilers below:<br /><br />I'm really sorry I bought this book after I finished reading it. I thought for sure the author was going to have a really clever way for Sookie to save Eric. Apparently not. I'm completely baffled how she got the story to this point. She (the author) and Sookie just literally \\"wrote Eric off\\" as it were. Even if he didn't end up with Sookie which was a mistake I think, she owed it to Eric Northman to help the character out with some kinda clever unexpected plot line. This was the kind of ending to a series of books that made me regretting getting so involved in the book series. What a waste of my time. I'm not one of those people who usually have the attitude of \\"I want my money back!\\"
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautifully written with characters that are easy to fall in love with! Can't wait to get caught up with all the seasons!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Alright, this movie is not that great.<br />The story had the potential, but the direction was okay.<br />Shout out to Eagles fans, but this is kind of an insult to the intellectually challenged, I think! What do I know.<br />Anyway, wasted my $5, should have waited for Netflix. Spend this time sleeping, working out of just having a nice conversation!<br />Peace!
B003R7L1CE|5.0|This is an excellent workout and the author also has a great and reasonably priced app which can be used with or without the book. Very happy with my progress so far
B005Z271Y6|5.0|People have covered this performance very well, so I only have one point to make, and to also be counted in the 5 stars crowd. I like to see the performers, and don't put a lot into move music disc evaluations for the picture unless it's really distracting. This is just her, no frills. But the music matters, and this is recorded very well. It's the disc you want to take when you audition a new pair of speakers. If the voice sounds natural, you have done well, and this disc delivers. I purchased the bluray version and it really shines.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|One of the BEST shows on television at the moment.  At first I wasn't too thrilled and was missing Anthony Hopkins but Hugh Dancy is filling his shoes nicely.  I've heard rumors of NBC possibly not renewing for season 2 because of production costs, I hope they reconsider because I'm hooked!!!
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|Easy to download. Excellent movie if you follow Star Trek or you are a scientific buff!<br />Best of StarTrek Next Generation Movies!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|very written book. easy to read and understand even for English as a second language users.<br /><br />If you are interesting on DevOps, you should read it.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Great movie for family and nice special effects.  Good story line that defines the character and engages audience quite well.  The cast did a very good job and it was not boring whatsoever.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Have not read the book, but I do plan on picking it up soon.  This is a very exciting and fun film directed by Christopher McQuarrie (writer of The Usual Suspects) and starring Tom Cruise.  It doesn't have costumed superheroes or grand special effects, but it makes up for it with real stunts.  A fantastic car chase scene through the streets of Pittsburgh is one great highlight for sure.  The film may not be totally true to the source material, but the author did make a cameo in the film, so I'm guessing he endorsed the screenplay.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Good entertainment for family, but the special effects were rather poor.  Kids would enjoy this movie but we found it rather slow since the characters were way too predictable and it could have had better suspense and storyline.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|my grandson plays this.  when you have not played the game it is hard to write a lot about it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It works well, and is a genuine Sony memory card. The card had a few game saves on it when I received it, but that wasn't a problem.
B00B2QA2F4|1.0|This movie is filled with blood and unrealistic gore. I hought it was the the worst movie ever. I did not see one scene that I liked. Do not waste your time watching. The movie has two great stars, but even their greatness Couldn't help make a violent movie filled with sex scenes interesting. I got lost in the plot trying to figure out what it was actually about.  The only reason I would watch it again would be for the fact the powers that be purchased a picture of a scene that I photographed to use in the movie.  I tried to find the scene, but wasn't able to find it.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I don't know what's wrong with me because I just love this serial killer!  I guess its my sense of righteous judgment.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|very dark, horrible music, black and white, poor photography, incredibly stupid and unbelievable plot, have no idea why it was produced
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|All the songs were essentially the same topic, but they really didn't go well together.  There were only two or three songs on the album that really appealed to me
B009MYARIK|5.0|I think Sophie kinsella is a fantastic writer. Her books always entertain me and make me laugh. Her characters are always quirky n amusing making u love them and want to hit some sense into them at the same time. This book was really good,  better than her last one. I recommend it highly!
B000I9YXKG|3.0|I like Auudrey very much. I think she has better ones movies, that what i gave  only 3 stars. I saw twice because i did not understant the theme the first time. But she is lovely, enchanting, and she did great.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Bourne fan so at 25.00 for all 3 movies its a great deal so had to get them all now on blueray good thing i did not have them on dvd
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It's nice to see a film that shows someone wanting to help his fellow man, even if he is not a tough guy.  The relationship between him and the main &#34;superheroes&#34; is is great.  Very entertaining film.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I love that it kills all apps and frees up memory! it can also be set to do so at different time intervals automatically
B00070DK5K|5.0|Have this on vinyl. The CD has a better presence in addition to the not included cuts<br />If you like Bowie, get this 2 CD set!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|My husband and I have the same exact tablet. Kindle works on his and will not on mine. Soo vastly disappointed!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Gamers that happen to be epidemiology students would love this game.  Instead of trying to wipe out a disease, you try to wipe out humanity with the disease.  Granted, the diseases don't exactly follow the real world rules, sort of like having the X-men of diseases, but it's all in good fun.  Highly recommended.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love that the weather is very up to date. It also sends out an alarm when there is a sever weather alert in your area, very helpful!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|And finally, this question: The mystery of who's story it will be. Of who draws the curtain. Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance? Who drives us mad, lashes us with whips and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible? Who is it that does all these things? Who honours those we love with the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us and at the same time sings that we will never die?<br /><br />Who teaches us whats real and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what We'll die to defend? Who chains us? And who holds the Key that can set us free?<br /><br />It's Steam<br /><br />You have all the weapons you need.<br /><br />Now Fight.<br /><br />~Paraphrase monologue from the movie Sucker Punch
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My children love this game! The boys and I love star wars so it is a perfect combo of star wars and angry birds
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I love this entire series. All three books grip me from beginning to end. I'm sad to see it end.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  It offers some hints and warnings to help you learn, and some coins for when you want to buy the solution and move on to a different puzzle.  I'm hooked!
B008M87GJK|4.0|THIS APP A RANGE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, SPORTS<br />AND MUCH MORE I THINK THIS IS A GOOD APP THANK YOU.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|everyone should read his books. I started reading his books about ten years ago.<br />I am waiting for the next one to come out.
1609611543|5.0|Bought this for my brother, he loves it! He is getting off the wheat already and feels better he says. I can't wait to read it myself.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Based on a true story, Argo is an uplifting rescue story. This is Affleck's best film since Good Will Hunting. If you like suspense, Argo is a great choice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love Walking Dead. And have been able to enjoy this purchase with no problems. Love the service I purchased.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The most disappointed movie starring Tom Hanks I have ever seen. The plot was foolish and the film appeared disjointed.  Cloud Atlas seemed like a series of different movies that were joined togeher and created as one. Even Mrs. Berry, a unique and most talented actress could not save this disaster. This film will go down in movie history along side such films as Ishtar and Heaven's Gate.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I couldn't quite remember the movie, but my girlfriend in Germany bought it, and I ordered it the same day.  We both received our copy on the same day.  The movie, and the buying experience were both awesome!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game to play especially when u play with friends. I love to play minecraft but the only things that should be added are nether portals lava and buckets as well as abandoned mine shafts
B000000OAC|3.0|I've got this one on LP, which I bought in 1979. Recently I thought: &#34;I still like this record very much, it's excellent, so I'll buy the cd&#34;. I listened to the newly remastered version of 2011 and never heard such a poor production in my life: thin, harsh, overproduced sound -a wall of noise... So I bought this cd, from the early nineties. However, although the sound quality is good, it's nothing compared to the dynamics and depth of the original LP. My advise: do not buy cd's from recordings that were intended for LP's. The watershed occurs somewhere in 1982 and 1983. Look for mint LP's instead and buy a good turntable and a phono preamp.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I can look up a word and I think the app is  cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-th Khrushchev j gcjucnthcjhhgckhkchgiygc in hand :) f2f j f2f :( ok http

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome my friends have wanted me to get it forever and I finally got it working great I am
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I played Angry Birds.  I went through all three levels then worked on getting three stars on all boards.  Never did it, but it was a heck of a good time.  It's still fun to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game sucks it's the worst thing to buy thank god it's free nahh i'm joking it's a great game if you like temple run and stuff like that and it's even better because it is free i recomend this game to everyone
B00683JLXA|2.0|Not nearly as smooth or fun as Angry Birds.  The only redeeming feature of the game is the sound effects.  They are actually pretty good.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As a fan of the old Myst games, I found this to be a real treasure!  Rich, beautiful graphics...evocative music and sound...and even the notes found throughout the games from the mysterious &quot;A/S&quot; (like journal pages from Atrus or notes from Yeesha)...added wonderfully to the intriguing atmosphere.  The puzzles were very well-designed, logical and challenging without being too obscure or frustrating.  I especially enjoyed the realistic &quot;tactile&quot; gameplay: having to actually turn keys or tilt the device to activate objects.  This was a joy to play..I highly recommend it and look forward to more chapters!
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|It pronounces the words very well. With all Test to Speech programs, there will be glitches, but this one appears to be able to handle some very difficult words with ease.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Based on the trailers I was expecting a better movie. This movie wasn't bad, it was just OK. OK for a rental but glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's ok<br /> It's kinda bad fun but some games are boring<br />Maybe there will be updates for games that are more fun<br />,,
B007ZD17XO|5.0|One of the best match three games I've played.  Fast, fun, frantic, and generous with the power-ups.  Gorgeous graphics and super satisfying sounds, as well.  Such a fun game!!
B001GMQALY|5.0|everyone i have ever talked to has told me that they hated this movie.  I loved it and thought it was very artistic and was way ahead of it's time when it was newly released back in the 1980's.  My parents wouldn't let me watch it when I was a kid but now that i'm an adult I a got a chance to check it out for myself and i thought it very well lived up to some of today's films.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is still an excellent read after all these years. Great literature is great literature and this is no exception.
B0091W7K6K|4.0|I've been a Steve McQueen fan since i was a kid and have never seen this movie until this year.  It was pretty good.  The action scenes were very 60's. There was a SF car-chase scene that rivals some of today's action movies and McQueen's leading lady in this film is off-the-hook!!  You should see for yourself.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|really fun game. great graphics and easy to play! get this app. you wont regret it! its so neat! I cant stopnplayyyying
B00BMBA2CC|5.0|really good album,wish most of the songs werent already released,but theyre still great,charli is one of my favorite artists right now
B00992CF6W|5.0|My title was my review. It is up there. I made a mistake. Sorry. That is my comment. Up there.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable did exactly what I needed it to do. Just disappointed in kindle that I had to buy a seperate item for transferring files from another devise instead of being able to use the charging unit cable with an USB connector on one end.
125000098X|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has been writing for a long time.  His earliest books were known for wonderful plots and surprises. This reviewer's favorite is his first:&#34;Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less&#34;. It is beautifully crafted. His more current creations are good but do not measure up to the earlier ones for zing and knock out  character and plot development. As in his earlier books, Archer plays with the reader as in &#34;gotja&#34; as an unexpected development occurs. &#34;Best Kept Secrets&#34; has all the verve, energy and gotja  of his earliest wonderful reads!  Warning: it is virtually impossible to set down! I had my first &#34;allnighter&#34; in the last 40 years!  Enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is by far the best book in the trilogy. It keeps you on your toes and had the perfect ending
B002W5UVSM|5.0|Unfortunate this is his only work. This had me laughing out loud at times while reading this book word word
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Total AWESOME dudes I like the way you play as this Japanese subway surfer<br />I think there should be a sequel to this or something
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just a fun game if you tire of solitare. Make it as challenging as you want. Enjoyable and just relaxing.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|As always Cassandra Clare leaves me rushing to the Amazon Bookstore to get the next one .Especially the Cliff hanger on this one. I am being serious. As soon as I finish this review I'm purchasing The City of Glass. Right now it is 2:12 in the morning I've been up all night reading this.<br />If you're looking for a great series that you just can't put down,The Mortal Instruments is the one for you! Clare's writing is unpredictable,in a good way,and puts twists and turns in all the right places so you never know what might happen next. I hope you try this book out!Happy reading
B006M4F67A|3.0|This game is not so easy to play for the firs time player, but it is OK after playing for a while.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I Hate this stupid boom<br />This boom is stupid because it just is.<br />I Hate I mean it, I Hate the room too.
B008J5T4Q4|3.0|I like most of pinks music and this album does not disappoint, however the recording quality is pretty average due to the stupid compression. Why do artist's and recording engineers continue to produce such poor quality recordings, that sound so average on good play back equipment?
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Although this wasn't as good as he other maze runner books, it was still very interesting. This book was very hard to get through and  I felt that I was just reading page after page of violent fights. This was my least favorite of the series. I would been just as happy only having read the first three books an  ending after those. This book really has nothing to do with any of the characters from the other books!
B00005QZH1|3.0|This recording is not as good as I expected. So I would rate it average. The music it self it very good in small doses, but can be a little monotonous listening to the whole album.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best game of theirs so far. Big improvement from dungeon hunter 3 great graphics and great game story for a kindle game. One of the best free games fighting style are better and a new light to this series of games. In opinion great game and better and less health potions gives more of a challenge.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The only thing I really disliked was the ending. I suppose it leaves a door open for a fourth book but just weak after all the reader goes through
B000002OZY|5.0|When Tommy was released back in 1969, there was a lot of talk about it. Critics were arguing whether it was sick or a masterpiece of music. But one thing is for sure, it was able to be tagged with the line \\"For sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, Tommy outstrips anything that has ever come out of a rock recording studio.\\" by Life magazine.<br /><br />What exactly is Tommy? The album takes you through the life of a man named Tommy, but due to a traumatic experience caused by his parents (The song \\"1921\\")becomes blind, deaf, and dumb to the physical world. But in his spiritual mind he prospers in knowledge that's interpreted by musical sensations. While, his physical formed is abused,(Cousin Kevin) drugged,(The Acid Queen) and molested (Fiddle About). Tommy finds contact to the physical world by pinball vibrations and becomes a expert. (Pinball Wizard) While all this happens his parents find situations to heal Tommy. They finally find a doctor (Go to the mirror) who finds out it's a mental block that's keeping Tommy from his physical body. Frustrated Tommy's mother smashes the mirror and it unblocks Tommy and he is normal again. But with his past experiences Tommy feels like a saint, a messiah-type figure. So he starts spreading the word he is the messiah and he gathers disciples.(Sensation, I'm Free, Welcome) So he starts a holiday camp and Tommy treats his audience brusquely and demands that they live in an austere manner in his presence. The discontent caused by this reversal is intensified when he asks the crowd to plug their eyes, ears, and mouths and play pinball-- he is less interested in his recovery than in sharing the things he saw while paralyzed. In the end his disciples turn on him and reject him leaving Tommy alone.<br /><br />The story is hard to follow and understand, but musically the album flows amazingly that even if you don't pay attention to the story you can enjoy the awesome music. Storywise, Quadrophenia blows Tommy out of thewater, but musically I like Tommy a little better. (A few songs I like better in Quadrophenia though.) Pete Townshend put all he had into this album trying to knock down every musical barrier he could, and succeeded with flying colors. Covering many themes most bands at the time wouldn't dare. But, whatever way you look at it, Tommy is a important landmark in modern music and rock music. From the awesome acoustic chops in \\"Overture\\", to the beautiful piano opening in \\"1921\\", the jamming in \\"Sparks\\", then the radio classic \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and then the end with the heart gripping \\"See Me, Feel Me\\" parts. Tommy is a masterpiece musically.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I know this isn't what we expected, but I appreciate her versions of some of the older standards on this album. I also love the fact most of the songs are not overproduced, resulting in an intimate sound. Diana still has that great voice and instinctive phrasing.<br /><br />I would love to see Diana produce an album with just a jazz guitar artist...or...Diana accompanying herself on piano only.
B000HZD168|5.0|Nothing I can say that hasn't been already said.  Just simply the best.  Perfect story, perfect time, perfect tone.  Love it!
193700788X|4.0|All though this book was not the best of the Sookie Stackhouse series, I enjoyed it.  I loved the ending and do not understand how people didn't see this coming.  I felt there were many hints through out the books.  In my opinion, it was the best choice for Sookie. My thanks to Ms. Harris for the many happy hours of reading and enjoying the world of Bon Temps, I am going to miss it very much.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! I didn't think it would be as good as it was with such an absurd premise.  I was pleasantly surprised at the character development of both leads.  Two very interesting people living life with lots of baggage but still being pretty nice people.  Hadn't read any Harlequin stories since college days - they have sure changed since then.
B00B52F278|5.0|Lets start a movement, to get another amazing season of this series,  Spartacus , The rise of Caesar, There's enough Characters still alive to be hunted abroad, And the antics of Marcus crassis and Caesar to fill in the rest, What do you all think  ???
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting game! I love it! I am sitting here saying ugh he got me and wondering how to get away from him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game everyone I know  loves it and it  fun to compete against each other. It's an addictive game :p
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book... the ending was amazing, and so unexpected!!! I would definitely recommend it, coming from an abusive relationship it's very enlightening as well.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is my favorite game for the iPad and Kindle. A good mix of using the touch screen feature and some skill with a mix of thinking and problem solving. A very fun and addicting game that isn't as mind numbing and luck as so many other games. Great product.
B004PIA4BI|5.0|the battery worked as I wanted, and I turn on my xperia, the battery lasts a lot, and thank you very much for everything
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I edited a lot of my pictures and this app is very great I made so many different pics of mine look better then the original

B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard lots of buzz about this Fifty Shades Trilogy, but I had no idea there was such a great love story behind the scenes. I was enthralled with the story and the characters. Thank you E.L. James.
B000GCFG7E|2.0|I love to read Lee's books  and usually cannot put them down. This one was an exception. It got too deep into the weeds and was boring.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It just was hard to keep into. I just did care for the way it jumped around.It was to tenckacel for me.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Love this book have seen the movie several times and love to see it again and again hope that you also enjoy it to.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|What more can you say, other than &#34;make my day, punk!!!&#34;  A collect of all of Eastwood's famous detective. Highly enjoyable
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|When I finally sat down to read this best-selling book, I soon realized I had made the right decision. Namely because the plot and narration are quite intelligently interwoven, the style is impressive and the characters are easily identifiable with ourselves, no matter if we are young, adults, here, there, bright, sophisticated, up or down, wherever and whatever we are. Moreover, personality traits as well as situations development are phenomena that have been artistically, masterfully, positively and last but not least, realistically, elaborated and portrayed.<br />As for the author's profile, I would not like to use any cliches here, but when I gathered that he lives so many miles away from my own location, I was genuinely surprised. In other words, despite the huge distances, I feel this book so close to my heart, mentality and world of ideas.
0684824906|4.0|If you liked the movie, Lincoln, this was the book it was based on. It helps fills in a lot on the life of Lincoln and the political genius of him.  A great addition for your Lincoln library

B001TH16DI|5.0|All five movies in one Blu-Ray collection, A great way to watch them. But be warned, not all of the movies were re-master, so read the description carefully.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have 2 other versions of spider & I play this one way to much. I love features like tap for cards to go. Great game
B001OMJGD0|3.0|This movie was okay, but I wanted to see more action from superman. Its not a bad movie, just to centrally focused on a love story
0307476073|5.0|Good read, I recommend it to all my friends. A lost girl learns a lot about life on the trail.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This is really good music. If you enjoy soulful and meaningful music, you will love this album. Great to see JT back action
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire, only 8 gigs,, and this game inc installs with a few MB, but when you open it it asks for like 30,000 gigs. I had to delete ALL my other apps to play a game where hackers are hangin out! So I deleted it. BUT THE STUPID APP DIDN'T DELETE THE EXTRA GIGS! SO THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ANY OTHER APPS AND I HAD TO RESET MY KINDLE!! Sweet job Gameloft on another terrible game, like Nova 3. I'm not gonna get anymore of these Gameloft Apps that need extra space again<br /><br />P.S. WHY DO THESE GAMES ALWAYS GO FROM 6.99 to 0.99 AFTER I buy them? Such a rip off money-jacker.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Executive summary: Great story, great characters. The writing is brilliant. I read the one-star reviews, and I think those readers don't understand the book. It's really well done. I'm looking forward to the sequel(s) (there's one coming out in January, but this could easily be a series).<br /><br />One of the best things is the writing. You know how writing teachers always say \\"Show, don't tell\\"? Well, Riggs does that. Watch this:<br /><br />\\"I clutched the rail and stared into the green waves, contemplating the fish who might soon be enjoying my breakfast.\\"<br /><br />He doesn't say \\"it looked like this\\" or \\"I felt like that,\\" and yet you have a complete picture of what's going on -- and I didn't even need to set up the scene for you.<br /><br />The book is billed as \\"young adult,\\" but if you're out of your teens, don't let that stop you. If you read the Harry Potter books and wondered what to read next, here it is.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Awesome game play, challenging, great graphics,5 stars! It becomes very addictive, you will definitely lose track of time while playing.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|This movie deals with the atrocious consequences of drug abuse in one of the most powerful movies I have every seen. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly are brilliant. Ellen Burstyn gives a superlative performance. Her haunted, destroyed look in her last scene of the movie had me emotionally devastated. Unforgettable!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Just when I thought Flynn might get predictable, I was surprised, again, by the way in which the loose ends were tied. The author pushes buttons, writing in a raw, nervy and frenzied calculation. The strong character choices and thoughtful psychology of the intertwined story lines truly provides an experience that slightly un nerves the reader. Read this book. Read them all.
B0061QD82E|5.0|So far it looks amazing compared to the original. Even the sound has been improved. Very clear picture. It was a great gift for my wife.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Wish every thing  was so good thanks for doing a great job  although I don't know what I WISH for more  time to enjoy all the benefits.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It's just the first season but its very imaginative. Right when you finally get used to the doctor he changes but its a good change for once the lead changes and not the sidekick.
B004UID2LC|4.0|All my family an friends who have  tried it love it an thank me  for telling them . So they can tell their favorite friends.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My 9 year old grandson and I love to play Angry Birds on the cell phone, so this was a nice break. We got to sit down on the floor and play face to face with hands and laughter.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|I enjoy Gillian,s writing.  Her books can be quite raw, but do keep you on edge.  I would really like to know where she gets her knowlege on personality disorders.  Good reading.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I went to the local theatre and saw it and just had to have it for a small but carefully selected collection I've started at home. Keepers!
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I loved the movie but at times the streaming quality made it look like a cheap bootleg. Add more servers or something Amazon this rarely happens with Netflix: at least allow downloading.
B001XV3LSS|1.0|I lost interest in this slow moving, trite story line . I never finished watching this outdated fiction movie. In addition, the acting left much to be desired.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Very wooden acting. Poor casting. Limited backstory on every character.  Seemed like the producers were more interested in selling tickets to the follow-on movies than this one.  Definitely couldn't stand on its own merits.  Special effects were not very good.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|There are several songs on this soundtrack that I don't mind listening to over and over again. They never get old.
0500516766|5.0|A fascinating look at just what is inside everyday objects and what surprised me was just how many bits there are when they carefully laid out and photographed from above in one of Todd McLellan's shots. A nice touch was keeping a running total of all the pieces: a 1982 Walkman has 370; 2007 Blackberry 120; 1960 blender 147; 1970 sewing machine 482; 1980 bike 893. Oddly cameras seem to have a very similar number of components: 1973 SLR has 576; 2012 digital SLR 580; 2005 digital video camera 558. Admittedly all these totals do include every washer, nut, and bolt. Most of the products were hand-holdable except for three, a bike, piano and a Zenith two-seater light aircraft (the CH-650 with 7580 pieces) this was photographed in the company hangar and shown over three pages with a fold-out.<br /><br />Take the book apart and you'll find it's in three sections. First the fifty products were disassembled and laid out in a precise and formal way, photographed and then a second shot, taken with strobe lighting, as all the pieces were dropped from a platform in the studio to create a free-fall photo of parts and the complete opposite of the other photo. Actually McLellan says he had more success creating these second images by dropping them in groups and using software to combine the photos. The third part of the book and the weakest in my view, are four essays looking at tech innovation, restoration, online repairs and product disassembly.<br /><br />These short essays are interesting enough but I thought they were rather out of place in a strongly visual book of products in pieces. They really should have had some photos, too. Penny Bendall, a ceramics conservator, discusses how she repairs broken ceramics: a valuable antique vase or figurines. Gever Tulley, founder of the Tinkering School, talks about his summer camps where kids can learn how to use power tools and make things from scrap. Neither of these two essays had pictures of the things discussed.<br /><br />This one of those wonderful books that can be opened at any page and you'll be immediately grabbed by stunning photos of hundreds of small items laid out with geometric precision or the same pieces floating in a spatial montage. I think the idea is good enough for second book (though without any essays).
0375507256|1.0|While I did enjoy the overall arch of the story and how all of the characters interacted with each other, portions of this story dragged on a bit. I kept reading under the general impression that it would get better, but it did not.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game.  Wish there were more.  Don't want to wait and I am hoping the future games will be just as much fun and equally exciting.

B008XKSW7M|1.0|Lame movie.  The acting was pathetic and the storyline was simplistic.  I wonder who may actually enjoy this sorry film.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Hands down for the price you cannot beat this bag. it has amazon zipper pulls but is exactly like the cannon bag for a lot more money. it fits all my equipment without fuss. 2 bodies and 5 lens and all the crap that goes along with any field photographer.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|PROS:<br />All 8 magical films in one box!!! WOHOOO.<br />No problems with skipping or any of the 8 disc<br />I got this at a GREAT price, around four bucks a disc!!!!<br />All 8 disc had original art work displayed on the front.<br /><br />CONS:<br />None really.<br />Just know that when you purchase this 8-Film Collection, you get just that. 8-Films. NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!!! JUST the featured films. Which for the price I paid, it was more than worth it. :)
B002BI6SMI|5.0|There is a good balance of action and soppy in this movie. Not a lot of lame side effects. Great actor and very good job by the directors
B0074VTHKM|5.0|It was really interesting and I loved that it had twist but I would have loved if they finished the Pete duffly tri
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read with interest this account of this doctor's &#34;after life&#34; experience. My only problem with these stories is that the individual is actually still alive so I don't consider them &#34;after life&#34; stories. The brain is a powerful organ, capable of much more than we can ever imagine. Still is was comforting in some regards and I am happy it worked out for this young man who was very very ill. This is more a story about miracles than after death experiences. Worth the read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Compelling court room and lawyers' firm drama with fascinating characters.  Excellent acting.  Each episode has a realistic & interesting story line.  I'm fascinated by the ongoing relationships between the attorneys, their rivals, their families, other key staff, and clients.  I love the series so much  I watch 3-4 episodes at one sitting!  The Good Wife is one of Amazon Prime's winners.
0142407542|5.0|I have my niece this book for her second birthday. It was the first gift she opened and she refused to open any more gifts until someone read it to her. Pretty sure my sister and brother-in-law have it memorized by now (birthday was 3 weeks ago), it is a favorite of both my niece and her 4 year old brother.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I've seen this advertised many times but didn't find it lives up to my expectations.  I have to admit I don't see any great fun.
0142403873|5.0|My two year old niece and 4 year old brother love this book. Thankfully the have &#34;The Gruffalo's Child&#34; as well since both kids an then have one to hold and look at at the same time.
B008E9R6RE|4.0|Great read although tended to be a bit long winded in parts. Overall a good adjunct to the series in my opinion
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read it through in less than a day. I'm a huge Twilight fan, but this series seems to have a lot more action. Definitely looking forward to the next book.
B002APS61I|3.0|First time I saw this a few years ago I was crazy about it and watched it twice thru. Recently after the Downton Abbey craze which I jumped fully into, I had the yearning to revisit this story because it is so similar, all about &#34;entailed property&#34; and women's lack of rights and social castes, which persist today. It's almost the same story. When the Downton Abbey season ended I was bereft. So I rented the Colin Firth version, the BBC miniseries, which others always compare to this movie. I fell deeply into that telling too; such a wonderful transporting viewing experience! *sigh* Lol. I got into a Jane Austen frenzy and read a lot about her and the book and so decided to see this movie yet again! And I was shocked by the difference. Suddenly I realized that this Keira Knightly version is quite untrue to the original story, while the miniseries is much closer. Ultimately the only good version of Pride and Prejudice is the book itself, truly, which I find more hypnotic than any video representation. I listen to the Audible version while walking my dog. It's great. One thing that highlights the failure in both this movie and the miniseries is that Mr. Bennet loved his wife and considered her beautiful. That is established in the very beginning. From both movies you get that Mrs. Bennet is a crazy idiot that he only tolerates! Both cast her as old, with old actresses, when actually I think she would have been in her early 40's, maybe even 39. Jane Austen pokes gentle fun at her in the book but the movies really trash her and for that reason I will only trust my own interpretation of this great story, from the book itself. But I wouldn't say don't watch this movie. Keira Knightly is luminous and fantastic and adorable. And I fell in so love with Matthew McFadyen. Definitely watch the movie, but know it is not the real Pride and Prejudice.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I enjoy her twists and this particular book seemed to have double twists.  Very funny and entertaining.  Her best work yet.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Star Trek is a great action movie. I remember the old Star Trek films, and I must say that the filmmaker has done a wonderful job of his remake. Seeing a younger Captian Kirk and Dr. Spock was great and exciting. The movie kept me watching the whole time. I would recommend this movie to old school Star Trek fans. I'm sure that they would love it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This group is well-named, because their songs are just fun.! Really enjoying my purchase, all of the songs are good.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's a bit long for a &#34;weekend read!&#34; Otherwise, it is a riveting, imaginative story of an otherwise good-guy felon.
1582701709|1.0|Don't have much time to be writing much here, but if you are a Buddhist and chant NAM MYOH RENGE KYO, my friends, whatever is in this book and the movie, is nothing but an inferior teaching.<br />So if you want to conform with less or nothing then just go ahead and buy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would give five stars if it did not have ads. I would pay for an upgrade to get rid of the ads. I purchased another solitaire, but came back to this one. I like the size of the cards and the fact you deal a winning hand if you want.<br />I still would rather not have the ads.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the book, loved the story, loved the characters...<br />I felt like I was right there in the story and would definitely recommend this book!
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|The rumors about Khan being the antagonist in this latest 'Star Trek' have been swirling for months.  Now that it's no longer a rumor, I was curious to see how they would make this plausible in the new 'Trek' timeline.  In the Original Series, Khan's exile ship, the Botany Bay. was found adrift in space by Kirk and crew sometime during the original 5 year mission.  After a failed takeover of the Enterprise, Khan and his genetically superior supermen and women are exiled to Ceti Alpha V, a desolate planet, but a chance at a new start.  This sets the stage for perhaps the greatest Trek film of them all, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'.<br /><br />I thought the script's challenge was plausibly explaining Khan's emergence earlier in this timeline.  On this level, the explanation was deftly handled.  Supporting cast members are given much more to do in this film, especially Simon Pegg's Scotty and John Cho's Sulu.  But the film ultimately is not very original.  Without giving away too much in the neighborhood of spoilers, the film feels too much like a re-write of 'Star Trek II'.  There are specific plotpoints, characters, and dialogue that are lifted directly from not only 'Star Trek II' but also from 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'.<br /><br />As for Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan, I know he's getting rave reviews and he does do a nice job.  But he's not making me forget Ricardo Montalban anytime soon.  The character is supposed to be from the Indian subcontinent.  Montalban, of Spanish-Mexican decent, was able to bring a certain gravitas to the role, something that resonates almost 50 years later.  By making Khan a caucasian Englishman, I think it makes it hard to accept him in the role.  Alice Eve as Carol Marcus with an inexplicable British accent is another hurdle I had difficulty with. Before I am accused of nitpicking, I'd like to point out that I enjoy the primary cast in their roles.  With the exception of Zachary Quinto's Spock, the actors physicallylook distinctive from their Original Series counterparts.<br /><br />The casual Star Trek fan will enjoy the film.  The diehard fan will be entertained as long as the inconsistencies are ignored.  There will be another Star Trek film.  Hopefully, there will be a new Star Trek TV series based on the extensive glimpses of Star Fleet Command and Star Fleet Academy we see in this film.
B002VWNICC|1.0|Actors - some of the best.  Story - one of the worst.  Have always watched everything until the credits.  Made an exception for &#34;LA Confidential&#34;.  Always enamored of film noir - starting w/&#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; & &#34;Casablanca&#34;.  Must be a Bogart fan, huh.  Traded this into Amazon.  I'm sure others like it - other good reviews & all.  As stated before - I never bother picking a film apart - what's the point - it's not going to change...
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really did think this would tie up loose ends and give some new insight to the series. However, this book did neither.  I do think it is the weakest book in the series.  It does not feel like a final book. It feels like a \\"I might want to start this series up again so, I'll leave some holes book.\\" So weak....
B00004XPPK|5.0|Seen this lots of times - favorite scene Guilda doing &#34;Put The Blame On Mame&#34;.  Imagine a long tight black satin dress complete w/long white gloves (gloves not on all that long!)  There will never be a more beautiful woman making a song sexier.  Not a Glenn Ford fan - he's adequate, I suppose.  Her evil husband - much better + handsome.  (Ford's nose always looked pig-like)  A Film Noir - a black & white.  What more could one want?  Rita Hayworth's most remembered role...this world will never behold a more gorgeous creature.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|How do you support someone's decision to end their life if they are the love of your life, your child, your parent or best friend? Can you love them enough to understand and support their decision? Beautifully handled in this story.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Have not had any glitches and I have been playing for about a month now.  Very addictive, I enjoy the game play.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is endearing because it teaches universal human struggles from a tightly wound British caste system oddly applicable to our times.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Being able to check the weather not only where I live but around the world, especially where my family lives.  You can see the weather maps, get the temperatures and other weather information.  I am glad I have it and have recommended it to others.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|These men were trained for so long and had to do a very hard and dangerous job.  They were trained so well when the time came they were ready and seemingly not nervous, just another day at the office so to speak.  How they got Osama is amazing and a very exciting story.  I highly recommend this book.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I was fascinated with by the twists. Very entertaining, good read! This book leaves you ready to sink into the next instalent.
B00ANGICRE|2.0|although it was worth the price for probably the only chance to see helen hunt with no clothes on, i could not keep watching it to the end, it just seemed to drag on and on

B005LAIHYU|1.0|Never has the ridiculous tried to sound more serious than it does in \\"Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter.\\"  Clearly a lot of money went into the numerous set-piece battle scenes, with growling vampires springing from the shadows everywhere, snarling and savaging mortals, and Abe Lincoln whirling kung fu-like and flailing and chopping away at them with his trusty axe.  Indeed, the entire shebang culminates in wave upon wave of vampires assaulting a Union train carrying the silver bullets and munitions necessary to defeat the vampires, who have thrown in with the Confederacy to battle Abe and the North. Blood splatters everywhere, heads literally roll, as the train barrels toward apparent doom.  But we get ahead of ourselves.  Suffice to say that the script is truly awful -- beyond awful.  Yeah, they made the mistake of letting the novelist write the screenplay, although with a story this ridiculous it would probably be hard to do it with a straight face.  Here are some dialogue samples: \\"Vampires are real, Mr. Lincoln.  They exist.  In every state, in every union.\\" Spoken to Abe, who is being trained in killing vampires with his trusty axe: \\"Do you promise to commit to the life of the hunter, and put aside feelings of vengeance?\\" (I kid you not.)  And when Lincoln is a little too wimpy with his axe, although he is being urged to hate, hate hate: \\"What do you hate, Mr. Lincoln?  Real power doesn't come from hate, but from truth.\\" And later: \\"Your enemies have the power to render themselves invisible.\\"  Yes, this awful, overly dramatic, wooden, stilted dialogue plods on and on, at times silly and embarrassing.  \\"Vampires have been in the New World for centuries.  They built an empire in the South.  But in recent years they have been moving north.\\"  Abe to Mary Todd, his bride-to-be: \\"You want to know the truth, Mary? Every night I go out and kill vampires.\\" Later, Abe turns more noble: \\"I would fight not with an axe, but with words and ideals.\\"  Mary to Abe: \\"You've gotta eat, Abe.  You're only human.\\"  And on the eve of the Civil War, the head vampire tells President Jefferson Davis: \\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, you'll have as many of my kind as you need.\\"  And poor Abe, fraught with remorse, troubled by the fact that vampires have infiltrated his playroom and bitten his son, taking the poor lad's life: \\"How can I win a war if I can't even protect my own family?\\"  It's not only Abe who is troubled.  On the eve of Gettysburg, the vampires lament: \\"It's time we had a nation of our own.  Come on, we've got a train to catch.\\"  No, I am not making this up.  All of this is too bad, because the battle scenes are quite elaborate and clearly a great deal of money was spent on this.  I know this employs Hollywood craftspeople and keeps the studio wheels turning, all well and commendable.  But you'd think everything would proceed on the basis of a reasonable script.Abe.  You're only human.\\"  And on the eve of the Civil War, the head vampire tells President Jefferson Davis: \\"Rest assured, Mr. Davis, you'll have as many of my kind as you need.\\"  And poor Abe, fraught with remorse, troubled by the fact that vampires have infiltrated his playroom and bitten his son, taking the poor lad's life: \\"How can I win a war if I can't even protect my own family?\\"  It's not only Abe who is troubled.

B004TI5N38|3.0|I enjoyed the development of John Puller's character.  He is a bit close to Jack Reacher to be truly unique and there are too many parallels for Puller to be considered an original.  However, the story is well written and the character can lead a series effectively.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Having just returned from a visit to this portion of England, I can clearly picture the people and places portrayed in this epic combination of fact and fiction (faction), of history and imagination which traces life in the south central area of England from the time of the Ice Age to the near present.  Basing the book in real life places, events and people, the author engrosses us in the lives of his characters who lived in each time period.  In addition he follows the genealogy of the people from beginning to end and traces their family personalities and physical characteristics that travel through generations down through the ages.<br /><br />This is a long book but it so completely draws you into the story, people and places that you really want to steal every possible moment to read and enjoy it.  Although listed for young adults it is appropriate for older and more serious readers too and is a wonderful way to enjoy history and see how life as we know it today developed through the ages in one portion of England.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Had to buy the last episode of season 3, as they didn't have it for free, but it was well worth it. This is a great show. Can't wait for the new season to start!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Many of my friends have read the novel.  I did not.  Overall, the trials that this hero encountered seemed realistic.  (the whale was an exception)  Even the premise of being on a life boat with a tiger, however unlikely, works.  Each problem he encounters is attacked, in most cases, successfully.  The flashbacks worked.  When the movie jumps forward in time to the present day, I got to like the character more.  The actors were believable.  Although never in such an unusual circumstance, I could empathize with the main character as a boy and as an adult.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I thought the movie was great. A lot of action. It had me from the beginning to the end. Awesome
B007DA2FHG|2.0|The movie was predictable with a happy-ever-after ending.  The coincidences: horse in the same theater; the owner connects with it; the owner is able to bring it home. Too much of this story was unrealistic ... like a Disney animation. With all the enviable work Spielberg has done, this schmaltzy film was a disappointment to me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book loved it<br />Good job I love the series<br />You should writer more books  I would buy thanks for the goo  book

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I've found the Blu-ray format to be a mixed bag for the most part. Crappy menus that pop up and stay on screen way too long, Pointless transfers (Like the Citizen Kane disk supposedly from the negative?), Forced downloads for trailers and content I don't want to see, Piracy warnings in foreign languages on disks that only play in Region (1) BEFORE the movie? But every once in a while something comes along that lives up to the hype and just totally blows me away.<br /><br />Tonight I acquired the Blu-Ray of the restored Lawrence Of Arabia and I'm stunned! I can see the grains of sand under their feet! Absolutely Amazing images, and they remixed the sound and got rid of most of my original objections of which I actually got into a texting match with Robert Harris himself about... It's one of the best transfers of a classic movie I've seen since Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and the 2001 Blu-ray. It's what bothering to assemble all this gear in my home was all about. If you have a high def system, I recommend this disk. You won't be disappointed....<br /><br />You have to love this movie to begin with though. I know there are those of you out there that think this movie is highly over rated and for you, I wouldn't bother, but for me... I'm looking forward to an evening at the movies with this disk very soon.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I was very disappointed with this last book. I couldn't wait for it to come out, and now I wish I hadn't wasted my money. It was so far off from the rest of her books. Boring! I was reading it on my kindle and before I knew I had only 20% left to read and couldn't believe it, where was the suspense? The thrill? Eric??? The relationship between Sookie and Eric is what kept my interest in these books, and you totally killed it. Boo! I hope the return of the True Blood series is not as disappointing.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I guess for those who want to write their own ending, this is great. He develops so many characters, and leaves most of them hanging at the end of the book. Not what I'd look for in a book.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|I like this game, the story itself keeps it interesting and there a few parts that startle you. There's so much walking back and forth that I wish you could tap the map and then be taken to that particular area; however that's my own opinion, the lack of this doesn't take away from the game. All in all its a very good game.

B003K15INU|5.0|For this and the rest of his body of work he deserves the Nobel Prize. His insight into the country's state of mind during the 60's is remarkably accurate. His characters are all valid, and reveal his understanding of human behavior.<br />Also the amount of research he does is astounding. In Moby Dick the reader learns how to process a whale. In equally thorough fashion, the reader of American Pastoral learns all about glove-making, and it enriches the novel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First book I read in a week time. Love the book but not the ending sadness but I know there's more
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This is my first Vampire Weekend purchase and I am quite impressed. Their songwriting and production is creative and yet creates a unifying whole. The tracks really flow together. The album is upbeat and fun on first listen, but the lyrics are deeper than they first appear. Really talented band. I can see why there's so much buzz around them - I think it's merited. If you like Arcade Fire, the Shins, with an appreciation for Radiohead's intentionality, you'll enjoy this album.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down.  Its a great story with plot twists and good charterer.  Book one has a twilight zone feel to it.  The rest of the series expands on the first
B004HW7JH4|4.0|I think it started well. But the following years to me it is  a down hill course. Still we will watch it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|When I got Evernote, I already had a notebook application on my kindle but I quickly grew to prefer evernote. I love the fact that I can view my documents across devices and I like how easily I can insert pictures and share the documents with people.<br /><br />P.s. A nice app that goes along with evernote is Skitch, which is another app by the same company.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|The music is new from his past albums, and was very good.  Some of these older songs brought back some good memories too!  Willie always does a good job.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is an awesome book. This is totally me with my ex. I love you Jeff Kinney and other people
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Gripping, horrifyingly possible, without flaw as it dares the reader to try and put it down. Wrecklessly human, reflecting the thoughts and unspoken doubts of every honest parent: &#34;Is it possible that my precious child is capable of unspeakable depravity?&#34;
B000SEIK2S|3.0|The initial concept is strong and the author's style seems playfully self-aware of the genre's tropes. Sadly, other the opening and a tiny bit of interesting philosophizing about age, death and what makes us human, I found the story increasingly uninteresting as the plot devolved into a series of bug hunts. The perfect-everyman hero is holographic — a cardboard cutout with a handful of 3D tricks. It was entertaining, but not groundbreaking.
B002UWH8P6|3.0|I am a huge fan of the stargate series but this show didn't seem the same. Everyone was cryptic and the show felt more like a show about character development then about the plot. You don't have the go to team or even a so called good guy you could always count on.  Acting is mediocre at best. Stick to sg1 and Atlantis and the movies.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|this movie was another good surprise - action packed and a great cast of known stars. Good to see the ease at which they enjoyed doing the movie
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome movie, awesome qualitly video and sound. Very impressed overall with everthing in this set. Will recommend to a friend
B0054SMIH6|5.0|this movie was very good - with no idea of how it would be - very surprising and for the most part clean language
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The book was confusing when it kept jumping from when the main character was 10 to when she was an adult.  I had a problem with her way of dealing with her baby.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|To me, a horror movie has to be at least somewhat believable to be scary and this one just isn't. All the scariest moments are in the preview so you've seen them before when you watch the movie. It's ok. The story of the little girls is interesting and that's the best part of the movie. But if you are looking for something that will scare you, this won't--unless you're 5 or something. It didn't even make me sleep with the lights on.
0307592731|3.0|The book was an interesting memoir about Strayed's early life and an odd impulse to hike the Columbia Crest Trail. She was unprepared, had an interesting adventure, survived yet I was disappointed that the subtitle really was not addressed as I had expected it would be.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife loves it and couldn't wait to receive the first two seasons as she was hooked after tuning in to the third season.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Truly a must see! The roller coaster of emotion will make you want to watch it over and over. This was a great cast & well acted by everyone. It also shines a light into a world most people will never understand. The power of positive versus negative is such a great tool & this movie expresses it in an all too real fashion. Buy this today, you will love it :)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|reminds me of viva pinata fun game I enjoyed it a lot. I just dont care for throw missions you have to buy stuff for
B006GECE9Y|3.0|Downloaded dolphin browser for kindle fire but not from amazon.I went to app store on amazon hit download but never got it they said I did couldn't do anything about it so got it from another source.You need this browser to install flash player in kindle you think amazon would support this
B005UG542S|5.0|It was one of the best Harry Potter movies that I have seen. Part 2 has to have Part 1 to make it the best of his movies.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Some cliches but overall a decent book.  I like the twist at the very end. Looking forward to the last book.
B008N1LL42|3.0|Neither hated nor loved this movie. I will say I liked it better than Transformers. Its whats to be expected from a film in this genre.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Never,ever seen anything cooler or as cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET APP IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT WILL BRING JOY TO YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006PE6VW6|4.0|Yes, watching the previews the end of the story is predictable but that doesn't take away from how the story is told. For its genre I thought it was clever and funny.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|This album is perfect. It sets the tone for the Great Gatsby and draws out the parallels between the rebellion of the 1920's and our own day and age. I'm surprised with how much I loved this album. My favorites are Lana Del Ray's: Young and Beautiful, Gotye's: Heart's a Mess, Jay Z's: No Church In the Wild, Bryan Ferry's: Love Is The Drug and  Beyonce's: Back to Black.<br /><br />However, the rest of the songs are awesome and work very well together. It's very rare that I will praise an entire soundtrack, but this one deserves praise.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This movie was the perfect ending to the Dark Knight trilogy. The movie was very long but you don't realize how long it is until the end and you get up. It is well developed and hard to take your eyes off the screen. The best out of the trilogy I think.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is very sensual and erotic.. I recommend reading all three. You won't be disappointed.  You may find some joy and relaxation. Maybe even find out some new ventures you want to explore.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|This app of Checkers works very well on our Kindle Fire and it is such a fun game.  This was a great purchase.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator uses the entire screen of my Kindle, and makes it look just like<br />a stand alone piece of electronic. Easy to use, nice sized key pad,<br />Not like this tiny text I'm using on my phone.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|We don't play this app as much as the other one with just the horses on the front.  Still it is a good app and works well.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|My favorite book this year!  Such great twists and turns, it was suspenseful and dramatic.  The characters were very well developed and it was a fast read.  Buy it!
B006PPP4NC|5.0|Unique casting!! And also great movie tricks in that time.<br /><br />Seems like a Agatha Christy movie, you love it or you don't. I LOVE IT.<br />You cannot see the movie and stay serious, all thos hilarious scenes.<br />Years ago i have seen it, never forgot. Many others tried to make a look-a-like, never this good!
B009IUH1N2|4.0|This is a very fun and simple game. I am more of a time management game person. I kind of stink at running and racing games but this was definitely enjoyable. Gotta love the combination of velociraptors and ninjas.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|You could almost guess the ending halfway through the book.  Still, it was entertaining.  I have to decide if I will read Book Two.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I give this trilogy five stars. From the first book to the last book it keep my interest. It had a great story line. I'm looking forward to seeing the last two books on the big screen.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|The movie seems to consist of individual parts made by men in their spare time as they thought of scenes.  Then in the end the scenes were put together in the order they were completed and the whole thing was called a movie.  That is my opinion of the whole movie.  The actors were out of character and the whole thing just made very little sense to me.  I would not waste my time or money on this if I had know about the movie in advance.  That is my opinion.
B005NS0VNU|4.0|All the music you need to hear from R.E.M. After I listened to this CD I was done listening to them for awhile.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Super box collection . Biography and photos were put together by Graham Nash and an he did an excellent job. Very Classy. Music reminds listener what a great songwriter, guitar player and singer Stills is. One of the best box sets ever!!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|THIS IS A FAIRLY GOOD SOFTWARE. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE GRAPHICS OF SOME OTHER PROGRAMS BUT SEEMS TO BE UP TO DATE AND ACCURATE.
0143122916|5.0|Well-written story of courage and discovery that everyone should read.<br />REALLY makes you appreciate your freedoms.<br />If fact, I bought copies for others to read!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I am very happy with this.I've been a fan starting w/&#34;One Of These Nights&#34;(Lyin&#34; Eyes).I found this history to be very enlightening;hearing the actual band members reflect.<br />I am sad Don Felder is no longer with the band.
B001U1V3RW|5.0|One of my favorite decks, I love the contrast to what most people have seen before in bicycle decks. It really stands out.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Handy compilation for Sherlock fans, who for the most part, are ageless, as are their reading choices.  Three more words, and thats a joke son
B006LA6IW2|5.0|This book has been me the finest true accounts I have ever read about a warriors life... I am honoured to have read Chris's story and learned a few things from it
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is a great book. It is kinda sad though. They finished the hunger games so what happens next. It is a great book though not quite as good as fergus crane.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|It's edgy, sarcastic, funny, witty and of course profane Everything you'd expect from A. Bourdain. It's a nice and refreshing walkthrough his becoming a chef and the nits and grits of the business. Read it on two sittings, couldn't stop it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I discovered it at a book fair in third grade. I started reading it, and couldn't stop. The Percy Jackson books are a great series, and many readers should read these exciting books.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Better have the tissue box handy, I felt as if I was right there in the water with the family taking every step with them. Really shows how the deep Love in a Family gives them the drive to keep going as well as their Faith. A wonderful Heartfelt Family Movie
B00BMQDM10|5.0|I absolutely love sophie kinsella. I had been waiting for this book and I have enjoyed it even more than I ever thought I would. A brilliant, funny, heartwarming read. Thank you Ms Kinsella. Please don't leave it too long til your next one!
B00BC0JGCA|5.0|My CD shipped and arrived on time, and in the condition I ordered it as (so props to the seller!). Upbeat, dark-and-wacky, folk metal sung in the band's native language makes for one kickass album that you can't help but drink and dance to.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Love this movie with a wonderful ending. I would have neverguessed what would be the end result in thus movie. Great actors.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|...from such a young artist. Filled with energy, she is already putting out wonderful stuff that is not only very listenable, but also danceable. It will be fun to watch as Lindsey matures.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a fun and challenging for my son. He could play for hours and hours. He enjoys talking about his progress in the games.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked the detailed account of pulling off this unlikely rescue, as well as the back-story leading up to putting things in motion. I also enjoyed the characters played by Ben Affleck, John Goodman, and whoever played the producer of the make believe movie. This movie partially explains why the Iranians seem to think every American anywhere near their borders is a spy. I'll probably watch it again.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|Hands down to mr. Haddon's creativity and originality (which earns this book a star).<br /><br />I honestly thought that this book would leave a lasting impression to me...but unfortunately, it did not.<br />I had a hard time understanding the informations and explanations in the book bt  did felt an understanding towards Christopher (so I am giving another star).<br />But one thing is for sure, I loved the thrill of the adventure even if I think that it is impossible for a fifteen year old autistic child to travel that far alone. And I love the ending so let's give it another star!<br /><br />3 stars all in all. If you are a logical and curious person, you would really enjoy the book. Plus, it has mathematics.
B00A8LYYI0|2.0|This was a terrible follow up to Silent Hill.  The great thing about the first Silent Hill is that is brought in elements and moods from Silent Hill with it's own story.  This piece of garbaged tried to just copy Silent Hill 3 and it failed across the board.  Spud editing, art direction, acting, source material 3D quality you name it, it sucked and that made me sad and I am a huge Silent Hill fan.<br /><br />For a movie shot in 3D the 3D was terrible.  It looked worse than the Clash of the Titans up conversion disaster.<br /><br />If you are looking for a showcase 3D movie or a great sequel to Silent Hill stay away from this movie and buy Avatar or Prometheus to show off your 3D
B0089EHWQE|5.0|.  the kind of book i enjoy reading.  i would recommend it to all my friends  makes you appreciate your health
B00A85EMVK|5.0|They really out did themselves.  sure there is still grain in dark lighting but for a mid 80's movie wow, they did a hell of a job.  Sound is phenomenal and the 3d was so well done in the conversion process it looks shot in 3d.  All the plane scene are top notch and add such a more realistic look to the film.  In the beginning when it shows a F14d landing on the carrier, in my opinion is one of the best shots in the film.  Vipers cockpit scenes in 3D are my second as the whole canopy is in your face.  And lastly yes the final combat scene is just awesome.<br /><br />Buy this movie
1451695187|5.0|The science community has a hard time accepting spiritual beliefs of an afterlife. Dr. Alexander's experience changes all that. Once you start to read it, this book is hard to put down.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Won't work on kindle fire. Wish it would tried downloading and nothing. On my desktop love it but on my tablet it sucks.
0061950726|5.0|A slice of American history that I knew nothing about.  Great writing.  A page turner...sad but I enjoyed it very much.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After hearing this on PBS, I had to order it. Will be ordering their 2nd CD - Parts of this made me weep....in a good way!
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|I loved The Great Gatsby (in 3-D especially!) and love the soundtrack -- I just don't understand why they chose to exclude Jay Z's \\"No Church in the Wild\\" from the soundtrack's CD format?  Yes, it is available in MP3 format, but I always prefer to have the actual CD and then burn it to iTunes.  So now, I'll have to buy this CD and then download the one missing song?  It just makes no sense.  Otherwise, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a while and the soundtrack goes perfectly with the feel of the movie.
B005LAII1C|1.0|Not happy I got a rental version of movie. It should of been half of what I paid. Should leave that in description of sale.
B00BDNCXTE|5.0|This is the show following the 2/28/80 Kean College.  Jerry's guitar playing is delightfully fluid and crystal clear.  His voice sounds wonderfully expressive and not yet worn down from his hard living and age.  Highly recommended!!!
B0029ZA3H4|4.0|I really appreciated this book because it is current, thoughtful and action oriented. Clearly, if an entrepreneur implemented the recommended strategies it would be life changing as well as business changing.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie isn't really for kids.  It's dark and relentless and amazing.<br /><br />I had heard such bad things about it, and about Kristen Stewart, that I had low expectations.<br /><br />I am happy to report that they, and I, were wrong.<br /><br />It's great.<br /><br />First, Kristen Stewart is fine.  I had only seen her in one film, Panic Room, and there she was a child and the role didn't require much.  But here she is good.  She registers a whole panoply of emotions from dread to ferocity to doubt to panic to despair to budding confidence to confusion to remorse to awe.  Most surprising, she shows herself to be a great physical actor: her lunges and slides and tumbles are really good.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is good, too.  After her horrid sleepwalking performance in Prometheus, I thought she had lost it.  Not so.  Here she is perfect.  She even overacts, which is precisely right for the role.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth is wonderful.  He's not just a hunk; he can act.  Even do humor.<br /><br />And the Seven Dwarfs are amazing.  I could hardly believe my eyes.  Ray Winstone???!!!  Eddie Marsan???!!!  And Bob Hoskins??????????!!!!!  Terrific.  I don't know how they made these guys into dwarves, but they are spectacular.<br /><br />And the whole look of the movie is great.  Grueling and dark most of the time, then flowering into brightness in the land of the fairies, and glimmering toward the end.  All of this is thematic, of course.  The struggle of the Good Earth Mother/Life Force (Snow White) against the Evil Earth Mother/Vampire Force (Ravenna), bringing the earth back to life after a long period of death.<br /><br />And the bird-theme is brilliant.<br /><br />All in all a wonderful movie.  Unlike any Snow White you've ever seen.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I enjoyed this cd.  I use it to exercise to and it works well, the music is just right for whatever exercise I choose.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Terrible acting, plot line was disjointed and hard to follow, just disappointing because I usually really like Tom Cruise movies.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One  of the best books I've read. Would recommend this book to anyone. Loved it from beginning to the end.
B008Y76PA0|3.0|This movie had real potential, the visual effects were stunning, the acting was OK but the plot and character development needed some serious work.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very enjoyable read. I didn't want to put this book down. Great addition to anyone's library. Makes you believe in happy endings.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|enjoyed reading this take on a new look of a person's soul and what you can do with it. The changes in you that you would like to make but are not able to, makes you wish this could be a reality to change you to who you want to be, and to change what you don't like about yourself.
B004SIP9VA|3.0|This movie seemed to go on forever and ever. Never really did understand the point of taking the dance class without his wifes knowledge.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Slow to start off, I found and it was hard to like the upstairs characters right off, but by the end of the 3rd episode I was thoroughly hooked.  Beautiful to watch with the deco, the hair and costumes.
B003L20IHE|5.0|i loved this movie. The first time i seen it was with my children. We all liked it.It is a tear jerker.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very thought provoking. Why are we so caught up with measuring time? One girl wants less time and an elderly dying man wants more. It's really the moments,not the amount of time.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|this is a great movie. The movie makes you laugh and cry. I really liked the part Betty White played.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Well, when I was trying to watch my video the screen kept turning  blue, and would pretty much freeze up. When I tried to search Gentleman (psy) and clicked it, the tube mate app searched Gently after I made sure I typed Gentleman so, I wouldn't recommend getting this app. This experience was about 20 minutes long, and Its a terrible app! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!
B001HBSVMA|5.0|this movie is really funny for the most part. It is sad in places. i really enjoyed watching it with my family
B008B68IV8|5.0|Granddaughter loved it and wants more, more, more!  She is a monster high freak and just can't get enough dolls and accessories!  Great price too!
B0054R6BFM|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, truly. The message is great and I will give it props for \\"changing the lives\\" of all the 5-star giving high school girls. That said, this was poorly written and I only read it quickly so I could get to the end and make it stop. The first thing that annoyed me was that the characters are totally one-dimensional and unbelievable. Hannah, who is supposedly talking candidly into a tape recorder, sounds more like she is writing a melodramatic novel. No one talks like that in real life, especially not a teenage girl. The author should have had a 16 year old girl read all of her parts out loud so he could hear how ridiculous it sounds.<br />Clay's reactions are incredibly over the top. His emotion about the whole thing seemed contrived, and by the end he is hurting himself on purpose to numb the emotional pain. None of it seemed real and I didn't care one iota about any of the characters.<br /><br />The premise for this book was interesting and it could have been great. But the author didn't write the characters as real people. It reads like a Teen Living Skills class PSA. I am glad that he got the word out about suicide prevention to the kids who have read this and I guess that's what matters.
B008B68IUY|5.0|Granddaughter loved it and wants more, more, more!  She is a monster high freak and just can't get enough dolls and accessories!  Great price too!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game. There have been times when the game freezes up on me. I also had an issue with the screen freezing as well.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Loved this game and the story plot.  Puzzles weren't too difficult to solve.  Hidden objects were quite easy to find,  also.  I enjoyed this game.
0345529057|5.0|As per usual, the books are better than the show. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show as well but I have actually stopped watching it so I can enjoy the books more. They have so much more detail and introduce characters better so you know more about what's going on. I highly recommend the read especially if you enjoy the show. The books are quite lengthy, but well worth the time in my opinion.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely a great third book. It had a great pick up from the second book. It was action packed and truly a good ending.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Occasionally gets confused and when you have no match, the hints will offer two completely mismatched tiles. Good selection of puzzles and nice graphics.
0812982622|5.0|Some parts of the book were quite vivid and emotionally tough to visualize.  I learned a great deal about North Korea even though this is a work of fiction; the themes and patterns were accurate.  I couldn't stop reading it.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I wasn't disappointed.  It was far from perfect, Padan Fain was a total after thought. Rand switching bodies was kinda lame but I seemed to enjoy reading from start to finish.  Lots of Mat probably had something to do with it.  Plus Jane Farstrider was pretty cool also.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This is one of my new favorite albums. His voice and lyrics are down to earth and heartfelt. I listen to it whenever I'm stuck in traffic. It has a smooth none dancing theme.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Perfect charger and storage case for your headset. Super convenient. I travel and this is perfect in my laptop bag when getting on a plane. I get off the plane and my headset is in perfect shape - protected - and it's fully charged!
B000817YF0|5.0|This is my favorite effort of Godspeed, personally.  The one complaint I hear from my friends when listening to this is that they feel like they are watching a documentary on trains.  The intro to the first song contains an excerpt that is one of the darkest quotes I've heard which sets the mood for the rest of the album. Thundering crescendos crash between soothing apocalyptic post rock. Amazing record.  The band included some extras like a coin flattened by a train and some more personal artwork and layout.  Thanks guys!
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I love this movie!! The characters are so well developed and have a way of evoking intense emotion. Some you will love others you will despise. Never a dull moment. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb!! In fact all the actors are...cant say enough about this film. I do beleive it is my all time favorite! A must see!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is easy and fun. It has kept my 5 year old daughter entertained for weeks. She says it has taught her friendship. :)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google search is the best search engine ever. Why use anything else?? It's informative and always providing the best links to what I need
0525952926|5.0|The only thing disappointing about Ken Follett's novels are that they end. This is the second in the series, read Fall of Giants first,  and takes you pre WW 2 to the Cold War. Highly recommended. Leave time. You will not be able to put it down.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is an amazing book I can never put the series down. If your into mystries I would definently recomend this book.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app is so wonky. Some days it works and other days it won't. Today I can't &quot;like&quot; anything. Sometimes I can't post, but then go to another device and my post is there twice.  I keep going back to my phone because this tablet version is the pits.
0345803493|5.0|Glad James continued after the first book.  Terrific and seems to be commpletly open about sex.  Who'd figure?!  When's the next trilogy coming out?
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Many books don't have long lasting effect but this one certainly does. The principles found in this book really will start to change your life for the better when applied. I recommend this book to anyone who'd like to increase their level of happiness.
0345803507|5.0|Enjoyed it.  Didn't know all this existed.  She's an excellant writer.  Liked the first person also.  Couples might enjoy a little of the &#34;kinky sex&#34;.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I've never read a Lee Child book, so this review will contain a critique based squarely on this as a film from an objective viewpoint. I will also attempt to avail any spoilers in the event anyone is considering wasting 2 hours and 11 minutes of their life on this title.<br /><br />My fiancee and I are avid movies watchers, in various genres. We love stories, we love acting, and we love talking about these things afterwards. We even ditched cable because our obsession with buying/renting was too obvious. That said, when 'Jack Reacher' made it's way to Amazon for rent, our decision watch the trailer was a no-brainer. You'll note that the trailer for this would have you believe (by implying quite strongly through its editing) that this is an action movie about a vigilante hero who rights the wrongs of social injustices. Possibly in a vintage muscle car. Apart from the car, this couldn't be further from the truth! In fact, like most movies that are absolutely terrible, you actually see all of the best scenes in the trailer.<br /><br />The film itself is lackluster and fails to produce any real interest in what's happening. In tandem (and perhaps more importantly) with this, Tom Cruise utterly fails to deliver in the role. There's no way to find anything 'mysterious' about his character, because he's too busy trying to culminate whatever charm and 'sex appeal' he may think he has left in his 50 year old body. Believe me when I say that after the first half hour of absolute boredom I was begging to believe his role if only to stop my restless squirming as the tired plot droned on. It just couldn't happen. My fiancee may have even groaned more than I did.<br /><br />There's a certain scene in the movie, where Cruise is exposing the plot... and the writing flips itself on it's head for a moment and falls into this poorly done Film Noir dialogue, as seen in those fabulous old detective movies (and books). With now understanding this movie was based from a book this makes a little more sense--but in the moment, where I had no clue of this fact--I actually lifted my hands up and asked what the hell was with that! Immediately in the next scene this style of dialogue disappeared and was never seen again. It was perhaps the lowest point of the movie. Not just in that it was poorly placed, poorly done, and horribly contrived... but because this is also the point in the movie where you realize A) This is confirmation that the trailer was misleading and B) The 'bad guys' are so ridiculously laden with lameness that the movie is only ever going to get worse.<br /><br />That is not an understatement. Because not only do I not care about the main characters from the beginning, now I can't even count on falling in love with the villain because they've sucked out any ounce of potential cool they might have had. By the time the movie is in it's third act and Cruise's Reacher is bumbling around in his midget-like strut to stay 'one step ahead' of the bad guys, I'm convinced he should never ever be put into the role of a person who is meant to be extremely intelligent. He can't do it! That and the bad writing didn't make it anymore difficult for him to crash and burn with it. He effortlessly manages to suck supremely in this role.<br /><br />At the movie's climax, I was hoping for a left turn. Perhaps one that involved a nuclear device landing in the predictable show-down scene that wiped out everyone--then roll credits. Sadly, it plays out exactly how you expect it would. With no flavor, no wit, no charm, and certainly without hope of ever being memorable. I'd say the vintage SS was the star of the show, but I've never been fond of those cars... so there's no solace for myself or the fiancee. Why this movie has so many good reviews I have no idea. I can only assume standards for films such as this have dropped significantly, or that many of the reviewers are fans of the book, Cruise, or all of the above.<br /><br />If you're like me and don't care about Cruise, the books, and actually have yourself some standard for movie entertainment... then my advice? Watch the trailer and imagine the movie the way it sells itself; it'll leave you with a great feeling, and then you can save your money and move on to something else. I assure you it's not even worth the rent.bout Cruise, the books, and actually have yourself some standard for movie entertainment... then my advice? Watch the trailer and imagine the movie the way it sells itself; it'll leave you with a great feeling, and then you can save your money and move on to something else. I assure you it's not even worth the rent.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It works the same as if I were reading on my kindle fire. Perfect! All my kindle books are easily accessed.
B003IDMUVS|4.0|In the usual Grisham vein. If you like his fast paced stye of courtroom based drama from mid west America you will not be disappointed. Recommended.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the different variety of sounds that you can mix and match.<br />I leave it on all night while I sleep.<br /><br />My favorite sounds are the beach and seaside as well as the various winds and rains
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Love, Love, Love Games of Thrones series. However, the last installment of the series hasn't grabbed me as the previous ones have. I am enjoying catching up with the activities of my favorite characters who were left out of the last book, but it seems to be off to a sluggish start.  I admit that I haven't finished the book yet and  will.... Maybe there have been too many characters introduced in the beginning, making the catching up a little more tedious.  I am sure I will be anxiously awaiting the next installment!  Come on George, get that next one ready soon.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Ninja Kiwi updated Android version.  Added 250 random missions and a couple of new tracks.<br />I play this on my Kindle more than any other app.
0345525558|3.0|Read for a book review.  It also got mixed reviews with our group. Some loved it, some disliked it.  It does not paint a good picture of our foster care system.  Glad I read it, but certainly not a favorite.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is HIGHLY addictive!! It can be quite challenging and exercise the most practical part of your brain. I play this game daily to keep my brain sharp .
1843106698|4.0|What a great reference guide for parents. It was refreshing to get some insight into the childs world (in easy to read terms, not convaluted medical terminology).
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This was my first Halestorm CD.  I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly suprised!  I love Freak Like Me and my favorite song is Here's to Us!
B004LUS390|2.0|It's fine that there are plenty of brush shapes, but there are a lot of novelty shapes. There is no soften tool, so blending is done by changing colors frequently. There is no hardness option, but presets have different edges which help with blending. I basically need layers, offset cursor, and an eyedropper. I can't move layers. The cursor has a little lag at the lowest settings. If the eyedropper is set to appear when hovering the cursor, it appears when moving the cursor. This makes the program unusable. Support said they'd look into the speed at which the cursor has to move before the eyedropper request is canceled. It's been a month, and the obvious bug is still present. I, like a lot of artists, pull colors from the artwork and the pallet we create on the canvas. Not being able to do this on the fly makes the program unusable. The other way to get the eyedropper is to go through 3 steps. Initial color selection is 4 steps. When I mentioned this to support, he said I should have bought the pro version if I'd wanted to pick colors in 2 steps. LOL. The pro version wasn't available for the Fire at the time. Why would I be sold a crippled program and then be told to give more money for a program that is more streamlined? Why would I want to \\"upgrade\\" when the developers can't fix a simple bug. The support guy suggested that all that had to be done was to change one number in the program.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Entertaining Movie - 3D makes it even better! Since seeing Michael Bay's First Transformers movie, I always felt the mechanical detail, complexity, and Texture of the Transformer Robots were Lost in the fast-paced quick-scene-cutting action shots.  As much as I love the HD detailing of the CGI, the aforementioned action shots caused a lot of visual confusion - it was very difficult to follow the action at times - a lot of detail was moving around very quickly.  I am Very Happy to report that HD 3D is a Great Improvement for the Transformers franchise and for viewing this type of CGI imaging!  Fast action CGI shots of the robots are more visually comprehensible, and you can naturally understand the visual depth and textures of the visually complex Transformer robots.
B001MM28JG|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie. The whole movie is brilliant..from the acting to the script. This movie is in my top ten of all time funny films.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|INTERESTING FORENSICS AND COMPELLING ACTION.SOME INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND RELATIONSHIP ISSUES FOR BONES.WOULD RECOMMEND AS AN ENTERTAINING READ AND TO GAIN A LOOK AT RURAL CANADA.
B00005JO20|4.0|We've all seen the big monkey in one version or another and this one is pretty good. It's corney but &#34;worth a couple of hours off the tour&#34; as we used to say in the war zone.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|It seemed like a second rate &#34;The Untouchables.&#34; I love Sean Penn and the other guys are easy on the eyes..
B00006ADD5|4.0|The storyline is fascinating, especially since it is based to some degree on actual events. But the camerawork and settings were splendid, and the eccentric Lawrence keeps the audience captivated as you wait for his ultimate downfall. Solid entertainment that is worth viewing many times over the years.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I love it.  I play it a lot and with so many puzzles I haven't gone through them all yet.
B004GYY714|5.0|I get this app with all my cell phones, pads ect...it's great and finds every station, style, worldwide I desire...
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Many of us have fallen in love with this musical partnership via their you tube videos.  Now it is time to put our money where our enjoyment is and support them as they break into the mainstream.  This was a good choice:  CD and DVD so one gets the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Check out their first SONY release as well..
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|on my android...it sits at the same time. I have to click it to see what time it really is...but when I click on it, the time is always correct.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I thought it was a very good movie. It was inspirational and heartwarming. All of the actors did a great job. I will defiantly watch this movie again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my kindle wont let me download minecraft for some reason&hellip;but its worth the $7,but I got it when it was on sale for $4
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|I received this in the mail and  can not stop listening to it. Superb composition which fills your ears with magnificent sound and your heart with an entire range of emotions. Buy it!
B002KVSJ64|5.0|My first Breaking Benjamin CD and I love it. A great CD from start to finish. I would recommend this to any modern rock fan.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Love the entire series. I Read them all so many times and still go back to them again and again.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love the show, great story line that keeps you wanting to watch the next episode.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I purchased this game based solely on the ratings. So glad I did! The graphics are amazing. You won't be able to put this down until you have completed every chapter. I can't wait until a new game comes out!!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Having watched a documentary made for Horizon (in the UK) that was being rebroadcast on PBS, I decided to investigate.  I bought the book and read it immediately and commenced with the diet (the first diet I have ever tried).  I suffer similar medical characteristics to those described by Michael Mosley that prompted him to try this diet.<br />The authors provide some scientific rationale for the success of the diet and they provide some personal insights on how to manage the routine of fasting.  They, somewhat, repeat themselves, presumably to justify the price of the book, since the crux of what they say could have been said in 20 pages!  Having said that, it works for me with early, positive, results!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is phenomenally done! The acting is wonderful and the story line is extremely compelling.  There are a ton of little Easter eggs in there for people who are fans of the book and the other adaptations. I will be so sad if this show gets cancelled.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is fun and beautiful to look at too.  The graphics are lovely. It feels like creating your own little movie.
1932735410|4.0|Good book to read if you need to understand PMP in-depth. This book will help you to understand overall process if you do not perform all aspects of PMP in your job.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's quick and will get you sweating!  Noticed increase in endurance and tightened up also.  Lots of arm and lunges - so I don't do every day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Story picks up where Hunger Games left off. It continues to build with good development. The ending leaves you hanging.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great for all ages 3-13.  They love getting the different jetpacks and seeing who can get the farthest and the highest score.
0140067477|5.0|There are some things in life that you hold close to your heart and love.  This book is one of those things.
B002SCF6CA|4.0|I thought this was funny i could watch it over and over very funny movie it you like twins you will like Junior
1476734941|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much but would have liked to have seen more discussion and fewer menus and caloric info.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|this movie is a must see for all ages. both my boys (5 and 18 months) love it. all i hear from my youngest is wreck iiiittt! or fissit (fix it) whenever he sees these characters wherever we are.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Takes you by the hand and patiently, clearly, takes you through the steps.  It anticipates common mistakes and tells you how to avoid them.  Made a daunting job seem simple.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|The story line progressed nicely, and many of the surprise twists caught me completely off guard. After watching it, I'm looking forward to season three.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|It can get a bit dry and sciencey at times but I still recommend this book for all my fellow free thinkers.  However next time I'll skimp on the science and stick with more of the theology.
B008645YEE|4.0|I bought this for my dad who loves dramatic soundtrack music.  You can't do any better for this than the Batman soundtracks, with their sweeping and monumental music of spectacle.  Hans Zimmer is surely one of the best composers of such music, as well as having quite a range in terms of other emotions.
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|After purchasing The Last Spire and listening to it all day everyday now for a week, it occurs to me, I need more Cathedral albums.  It's unfortunate that this is their last, but comforting to know that at least for me, there is a large back catalog to immerse myself in.  The Last Spire is less progressive or groove inspired than most of their outings, but smolders and burns like Forest of Equilibrium given 20 years to mature. This is a vintage sounding Doom album, with a more death metal inspired edge.  Lee Dorian uses his encyclopedic knowledge of obscure music to meld a strangely crafted but altogether glorious broth of all his Doom record collection's greatest hits, as well as Gaz Jennings' rich musicality, to make something like Thai soup.  Salty and Sweet. Spicy and Sour. The colossal pace and troubled vocals add a dour sense of impending demise which is super appropriate for this swansong.  I feel condemned to listen to this for eternity in the pit for a life of rock and roll and bad choices!  There are just not enough adjectives to describe the goodness found here-in. Buy. Burn. Enjoy!
B00BAYLQI0|3.0|All the actors were fine; the script leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The sterling performance and the amazing maturity of the oldest son, Lucas, was a tour de force.<br /><br />As for the rest, I give it only 3 stars. But keep an eye out for the boy who played Lucas, this kid is a great actor.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is an amazing app!! It's well programmed, no glitches, and best of all..... NO ADDS! Most free games are really stupid, hard/hard to control, and to complicated! Not Draw a Stick Man Epic! It's simple/straight towards, addictive and fun! It's also very original! You get to NAME and DRAW the characters, draw things like fire, axes etc. This app is great for kids and young adults! It's simple, yet has challenging puzzles. This app lets your creative side shine!<br /><br />Draw a Stick Man Epic is basically about a character you draw making its way through a book to find his friend.( you name and DRAW) Go to level to level drawing your way though challenging puzzles. Go fight a troll, LET YOUR IMAGINATION SHINE! So, what are you waiting for, start your adventure now!! Buy Draw A Stick Man Epic!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I rented this movie, Flight, because I have a crush on Denzel Washington, and I think he's an incredible actor. However, this movie as a whole is very good. Flight makes you look at the societal idea of what you should be and what you should present to the outside world. The lead actor, because of his own inner torment, shockingly tells the truth about himself which makes for a very compelling movie.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I've read hundreds of books about 20th century warfare in my 24 years, 19 of which I have been reading nonfiction like this. When other kids were watching Barney and reading Goosebumps, I was reading stuff like this.<br /><br />With the aforementioned background in said genre, I can safely state that this book is superlative.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie for the very good acting by the lead actors, but also for the message that despite having mental differences you can still love and be part of a family's love. This is a very meaningful film.
1572814136|4.0|I just started reading tarot, and this was my third deck (the other ones are the Mythic Tarot and a Marseille-based one). My boyfriend reads cards for some years now and already had the Rider-Waite Deck, the \\"official\\" one. I bought the radiant because it was way prettier than the original one. However, when we compared the two decks, card by card... Some details are missing. Some important details, indeed. Drops, birds, rings... I still don't know how it affects readings, but it kind of disappointed me.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Is it entertaining? Not in the traditional sense, since much of it reads like a text book. Yet I found myself drawn into it more and more, especially during the final third.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I loved this movie and the shipper was right on time the movie is out there a bit but its funny for sure
B003TSEEDY|5.0|She says it's really good.  Entertaining, good plot, well developed characters.  Of course this is the review of a (very, very bright) 12 year old.  Some mention of drugs and &#34;intimate&#34; scenes... so be warned.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's a hidden object and locked in the room game combined. The graphics are beautiful. There is plenty to do and lots to keep you interested for a very long time. There are many rooms to explore and many missions and levels to keep this game exciting. I know I'll be playing this game a very long time.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|App is subpar. You have to work to find what you want and it forces you to wade thru failed hotel lounge acts for the pay off.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|It was worth the 10 year wait. Best songs are Heat, Love is Lost, If You Can See Me, Valentines Day, You Feel So Lonely You Could Die and several others.<br />Masterpiece.<br />Also cool watching my teenagers enjoying it. It's now come full circle.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|If you believe in transcendent love that spans more than a single lifetime, and if you value a 5-star cast of actors (look at ALL of the primary roles), take some time with this passionate film.
B009R659L8|5.0|This lady never writes a bad book. She will keep your interest until the last page. I think it was about 1:30 am when I finally put it down.  Can't wait to read her next one!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|If you're at all a fan of superlative production, top notch audio/video, and incredible talent then by golly buy this NOW.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|One only has to listen to the Chopin repertoire to be taken into a state of relaxed, meditative existence.  The performance is amazing and the calming sound is a sedative for the worried mind.  Awesome!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I know its for &quot;kids&quot; but I enjoy playing this app after work or before bed.Super relaxing. it has a calming affect for me-but I won't lie it is starting to get expensive
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is exelent but when will the next minecraft pocket edition update going to be out 0.7.0 i really want to have that update so please give me the update
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It only took a few hours to play but wow, what an enjoyable few hours!  Great graphics, loved the logic type puzzles and how extremely well they fit into the story.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these for my daughter who uses them on her stereo.  She loves them.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|very disappointed, not worth your time or money. The trailer was the best part of the movie. Liam must have really needed money.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Great flick about a military action cloaked in secrecy. It took us a long time to get Bin laden and now we know why.
B0098460O4|5.0|The only criticism I would have about together is like some of the others the extra singers are not needed but its a minor complaint still a beautiful album.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very pleased. Had tried iTunes and syncing of audio and video was off. Annoying. I do wish I could watch on Ipad but Apple will not allow Flash drive.
B004P7CNE0|4.0|I viewed this without subtitles so even with my headphones on, I missed about 20% of the speech. Had I heard it all, I probably would have given a five star rating. At any rate, with so many ratings already in, I need only add my vote to the many: this is a fine picture for those  who want balletic action with a story that keeps one in its grip until the final curtain. The star does a first rate job and is well supported; wisely, the truly dramatic high-jinks in the use of handheld weapons is accentuated by its sparing use. The New Age story follows a general pattern: chief enforcer of a New Society dominated by a small elite and subjected by direct force and drugs taken by the population is freed by accident from the impact of the drugs  and comes to see things as they are. His life takes a new turn (which I should not describe to avoid revealing what it is better not to know beforehand ). His ability to love and hate is revived, as is his capacity to think and evaluate his situation and that of the New Society.<br />I found it engrossing throughout and a winning yet quite human action film.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Each book is better than previous one looking forward to read next one on the same series of books or a new one.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|There are not many books i enjoy that i have to read for school, but i enjoyed this one. The beginning started off slow, but once the murders began it became a page turner. The ending was so unexpected but it was a great way to end the book!!!
B00023B1LM|5.0|This is the second attempt at writing a review.  I am fully satisfied with the seller and the Amazon involvement.  The DVD is as promised in the advertisement on the Amazon website and we couldn't be more pleased.  We will watch this movie again and again - we are Bourne (Matt Damon) fans.  Thank you, sincerely.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This case holder for my Kindle 8.9 H.D. is just what I wanted and moreover it does exactly what anyone would want. Right down too having the screen shut down when you close the cover! It stands vertical or horizontal . Holes for the speakers also! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT !
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|Already reviewed I think - however, I will say again, I am very pleased with the product.  The seller's promise stood up and the DVD was in good condition and we will enjoy it for many more viewings I'm sure.  Thank you.

B009E3EWPI|5.0|So glad I recieved this as gift for christmas this year.  Jam out out to Robert Plant and Jimmy Page!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This dove into the life o Jaycee. It kept me reading and I couldn't put it down. She lays everything on the line and isn't afraid. It lets you know what kind of monster Phillip and Nancy were/are. I would totally recommend this book to everyone willing to read it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this, Fox and Terrantino?  Jamie Fox gets into his character and makes you believe he's been a slave.  Even though, of course there are lot of exploding heads, bodies etc. even a few buildings, it is Tarrantino ya know, it has a good story plot as well.  The acting is great and I sure hope there is a sequel because there is a lot they can still do with the story.
B006LSZECO|3.0|For a girl who only occasionally strays from my preferred genre, this book was a pleasant surprise.  I'm ready to bring on board Sharp Objects and, really, I should include Dark Places since all three have had the movie rights sold.  It's always fun to watch a movie and pick apart all the liberties the directors and producers impose.  Also, to be the one to say \\"It wasn't like that in the book\\" or \\"They followed the book pretty close\\".  Either way it feels kind of delicious to know what's coming next when the person beside, in front of or behind me has any idea what's about to happen.  I will certainly be reading another of Gillian's books.  Looking forward to the movies.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|picture and sound is great.  acturate time lines and places for the battle.  commanders did a fine acting performance for this picture.
0375703764|5.0|What a book. This book made you think someone was behind you when reading. I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves this type of literature.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|im an avid movie fan and love both miracle and 34th street movies.  picture and sound are both excellant.  the best
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great how all storylines get together in one big climax!<br /><br />It took a long time and a lot of reading to get here, but it was worth it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Do no spend your money here. I've been playing for months, spent money in game, just tried to play and it had DELETED my park and my money. So ticked off right now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved it! I can't wait for more to come. It was challenging but not so much that you couldn't figure out out. I hate when that happens!
B00BY8DFRW|5.0|Bought the vinyl version and glad I did, the warmth and feel of this album far surpasses anything digital could offer.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I like this album very much! It brings back Deep Purple's roots! RIP JON LORD! You will be missed! My least favorite thing is the album cover, little boring.
B002VX0A40|4.0|I have made a habit of ordering Lamaze toys for my daughter. She greatly enjoys this (as an astrological water dragon) but something about it makes it feel of slightly lesser quality than the typical Lamaze. Perhaps developed for another country?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Never seen or played anything like it. Addicting game. Wish there would be levels of the game to complete instead of going on and on.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I had not seen this series but so many of my friends were raving about it so I decided to buy the first season to see what everyone was talking about.  I am totally hooked and have already purchased the remaining seasons.  Love it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Addicting works great. No problems with the app, unlike the android one on my phone this one seems to work perfect.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|App is very easy to use, loads quickly, works well with the kindle fire. talks are very good as well.
B007HLIUN4|4.0|Though i agree with the basic premise articulated in this book, the analysis of historical events seems to be predetermined without actually accounting for local nuances. Also, having no detailed analysis on India at all - a country of 1.2 billion people with a remarkable diversity of political and economic institutions over the last 3 millennia- undermines the credibility of the research and its outcomes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I wish they can put pocket eadition<br />It's amazing but I don't like it in Tokyo
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Great book as well as.enlightng and understanding of autism  well expa<br />Li<br />Aimed in a good story . Makes this illness easier to understand and makes you think what these people face
193700788X|5.0|I have read every book in this series (Long before True Blood which I can't stand!) and I have to say that I wondered about the last book and how it would compare to the others. But Charlaine Harris DID NOT disappoint in any way with the finale book!! I was personally thrilled with the entire book (read it in one sitting!), it had everything you would expect from Sookie&#34;s crazy life and then some. So for those of you out there that have read the terrible reviews. don't let that discourage you from reading this book. If you are a Sookie fan, I promise you will not be disappointed that you picked it up!<br /><br />As for all you nah-sayers out there, just because you are not a real Sookie fan doesn't give you the right to try and ruin the book for everyone else!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've read the entire series, you crapped one out in the end. Horridly slopped it together and it makes no sense. I'd like my money back and I'm off to read fan fiction. I'm sure someone has done a better job creating an ending for the character's you created. Very sad ending indeed. I have no intention of purchasing the next book. You should have finished the story not thrown together this and then plan on tricking us into paying more for After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse. I think after this book you've lost alot of readers so sales will be a bit lacking.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It definitely makes you think a lot about technology and what is possible.  A quick read that is easy to understand.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Best pinball game on the Amazon app store. Strange that a licensed game uses re-recorded dialogue, but otherwise top notch.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are dying for the next season to come out.  Can't get enough and I hope they keep going for years to come with the series
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you are looking for a standard Solitaire game this fits the bill. You get an advertisement when you first open it by thankfully there is a skip button. It's addicting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just downloaded this to my kindle fire.  I have enjoyed playing this on my kindle.  The only thing I do not like are the ads that keep coming up between games.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I keep this book on my Kindle's favorites list. One of those books that you can't put down. Lots of twists and turns all the way to the end.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|My favorite part of this movie is the music, but the love story is good, too.  I didn't notice any drugs in this movie as mentioned in an &#34;article&#34; I read about it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the most moving books that I have ever read.  When I heard it was about a quadrapalegic I didn't think I was going to like it but boy was I wrong.  Trust me.....read it and you will soon be moved by this powerful story!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I like the way the favorite hits were remade by the actors/singers.  I like some of them better than the originals.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I adore this game. It's cute, somewhat realistic, fun to play, and doesn't eat up your cash. The only thing I wish the game had was the ability to create your own horse.
B00CDCLL1A|3.0|I love fantastical, weird, visually stimulating movies like the Life of Pie, Imaginariam of Dr. Parnassus, Star Wars, Moulin Rouge, etc... This movie is a total let down. It's hard to follow, and really deep - the core plot is about slavery and how it is handled at different times throughout history. This isn't the Matrix, it's the Matrix III when Neo only sees in fire. I regret purchasing this movie as it is not very engaging and I don't know if I'll watch it again.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|LOVE this game! Very addictive and fun to play! The only down-side is that I wish it was easier to get/earn coins.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Loved the acting and Charlestown scenery. Lots of action and chases. Good companion to &#34;The Departed&#34; for my Boston collection.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It felt like I was playing a dumbed-down version of Frontierville on Facebook. Very boring. The graphics were cute, music was okay, gameplay was alright. I was hoping for a more true to the original Oregon Trail game.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|It's tough in Boston and this movie shows a slice of true life. Glad I didn't live in the neighborhood.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very cute! What MLP fan wouldn't love their own Ponyville to care for? The only downside is the ponies that require gems to purchase. Very pricey!
141694737X|4.0|Cute, short, my grand daughter loves it.  Picks it often out of her many books to have read to her.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|With this game, get ready to do the same thing over and over again, with no progression seen. It's very boring and dull. I thought with a LPS game I would be able to dress up cute pets. NOT. In all, it's something that might occupy a 5 year old, but not an older child.
B006M4F67A|5.0|If you want real Chinese Mahjong, this is not it (I play with my Chinese in-laws a lot). If you want a great matching tile game and want to call it Mahjong in the Americanized sense of the term, this game is the best. The graphics are awesome, the touch screen is sensative and intuitive, and this game scales between Samsung Galaxy SII phone and Note 10.1 tablet superbly.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is a great first person shooter for the Kindle.  I set this up for my son and then found myself playing it over an hour later!  Good graphics and smooth game play.  Recommended.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|This better not suck because I need this to help me through college algebra. After this summer I semester is over, I will come back and give this the update it deserves for better or worse. Purchased based on mass 5-star reviews on Play Store and developer's responsiveness to less than 5-star reviews with valid concerns (versus low ratings just to rate low). Preliminary tests indicate this is a good one, no problems so far.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|It's a RC airplane simulator, what else can you say?  There's not much to it but I guess you'll enjoy it if you wish you were outside flying RC planes but can't.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Never played the original game, so I can only judge this one based on game-play itself. I played enough to get a sense of the challenge based on playing shape options to land on the board similar the way Tetris drops shapes down, but more shapes and you place them (they don't drop down) in zones adjacent to your assigned color and strategically pick the shape to try and block the competitor from moving their blocks. The computer seems a little vicious.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Saw the author speak at a conference and  loved the information.  Great advice presented in a somewhat scientific manner which I enjoyed.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I've never read anything like this.  Joe is able to portray each character so vividly.  Excellent read.  Can't wait for the next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i enjoyed the series and cant wait to see the next two movies. I would offer them to anyone to read.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|I got this game for my 2 year old and she loves it. I just have the free version which is animals, but it's a learning tool as well. The only negative I will say is that it's hard to color \\"pretty.\\" For small kids who just want to scribble, it's great. I just think older kids who are more perfectionist it would be a little disappointing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best book of the series. The story line was intriguing and the relationships were well thought out. I enjoyed the ending. Wi wish there was another book to read after this one. This is not a complex read, but a fun one.
B0013527I4|5.0|Arrived in new condition, a week early.  We bought the entire Muppet Show Set for my Daughter's birthday. She is 24 and it started a sleep over.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My kindle fire has a much larger screen, better selection's, and longer playing time. I can play against other player's
B000FC13MM|5.0|I loved this book! I have to buy the next two to keep reading. It's a fun read with some tension and, since it deals with the dead, I wasn't entire sure how it would end for the main character.
B000FBFML6|5.0|The Golden Fool is yet another strong work by Robin Hobb and helps to explore other facets of Fitz Chivalry Farseer as well as characters such as the Fool, and Chade. Ends on a cliff hanger so I'd recommend ordering books two and three at the same time. Can't wait to see what happens next!
B001EN71CW|5.0|upgrading my system and this was high on my list for the library<br /><br />spartan case but it is the contents that are important
B005BGBPBG|1.0|NOT well done, not clever, not romantic, not sweet, not worth it. OMG so skippable. DO NOT WATCH, you will want the two hours you spent on it returned to you. HOLY TOLEDO, I am pretty generous and down with most cute mindless chick flicks, such as Clueless and Bridget Jones, but this was AWFUL. AWFUL. Ginnifer Goodwin seems like a sweet person, but she was terrible in this and an unsympathetic character. No screen persona. She was just as off-putting in He's Just Not Into You. I want to like her, and I'm rooting for her, but she is dismal. Sorry, Ginnifer. Two down, and I just don't have that much leisure time to give you another chance. And Kate Hudson does NOT play evil well.....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just really enjoyed the great acting and the great story lines and subplots that ran throughout.  I don't know how authenic everything was to the actual period in regard to mindsets, but most other (non Downton Abbey) shows are clearly unauthentic.  This, at least, seemed very plausible.  Great show!
B007PLRM9Y|5.0|I wish her gobs of success. This is my second Gardot album, and I appreciate it's available on vinyl. Great album, lots of presence. She sings from the heart
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Well, the screwdriver works like a charm, the only thing I dont like too much is the pen on the bottom, that keeps falling  if you hold in certain ways...  but its nice and functional for cosplayers and to play with lil' children. My cousin with only 2 years old  loved it and he even asked me to watch doctor who with him! haha
B004DM0UII|5.0|I LOVE this app I can access pretty much any music any time. No glitches and easy to use . Looks great  also. My all time favorite player. Great job.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Not the best you can get a lot better games than this horrible game and you need a password to get onto the game
B008QMMEOE|3.0|Good but you have to buy the boats, and planes so its a tease for a 2 year old that he can't play with all the shapes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Although somewhat different from the movie, the book is still fantastic. I could not put it down. The characters feel so real and natural, and everything flowed so easily. I loved it!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Like all the others in this series, this book was well written. It was a great final chapter to the wheel of time.
0545265355|5.0|I have only positive things to say about this product:<br />It got in Brazil really fast, even though I  ordered the normal shipping.<br />It came very well packed, product intact!<br />Also with a really good price. I would recommend this to anyone!
B0015ZNNEE|4.0|I am not a big classical music expert.  I do like this.  It wakes me up and makes me happy.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I'm biased.  I love this series.  The books and the movies.  Mr. Jackson has done an awesome job bringing the books to life.  As for the Hobbit, people are criticizing it for the way it was shot...super duper high def.  Well, it looks awesome to me on my 46&#34; TV and I say if this is 'bad' I'd hate to see really bad.  Mr. Jackson knows his stuff and knows his Hobbits.  Pan the film but hey, what do you want guys?  This is great stuff for our times.
B008ODZUN2|1.0|Weak unlikable characters, lame story that's been overdone. Absolutely did not care about these people. They all seemed determined to ruin their lives without help from anyone else. The only decent person among the cast of characters was the landlady.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This verified a lot of information that I wasn't sure about.  Very informative<br />and genuine. I enjoyed it a lot.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Must see...we laughed a lot!  Fantastic cast of then young actors! I have to see this move again to catch all great lines.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although the reader will want to keep reading to find out what happens, this was TV mini-series cheesy at times.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the app but they don't have mine cars or buckets but I was told that there is going to be an update. I'm not sure if that's true but if it is.. GET THIS APP!!
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|While the first section of the second half drags just a touch, it is a very good book overall stuffed with examples and data.  While I tend to share the author's view on the benefits of being a giver anyway, it was nice to have the data to back it up.  Will be sharing much of what's in here at the next meeting for my staff.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|I ran out of Follett novels so I finally tried &#34;Triple.&#34; Good, old fashioned spy novel with some timely reminders of the Cold War tension that spilled over to the Middle East. Perfect summer travel read.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|With the exception of sections at the end where it gets slightly long-winded and preachy, Rand is a wonderful writer and story teller.  I couldn't disagree more with her philosophies, however.  I love her characters, but not the conclusions to comes to with them.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|a very difficult song sung by the only singer who could do it right.......ADELE.....!  Would highly recommend even if you didn't see the movie !
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|not for me, a game for kids, they would love it, just tried it 2 times, too simple, had to find one for a grown up, kids would love it
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I needed a charging cable for my daughter's kindle. It fits great and does the job. Its a cable, what more can I say?
0307949486|5.0|I burned through this book and then the rest of the series in about two weeks. This book is a top-rate murder mystery with really interesting characters. The following two books are their own story essentially. This one stands alone as a great book.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I got this like 5 minutes ago and I am already a total addict to this game<br />It's even better than the original with great graphics and 2 cute characters in each level
B0068THAGY|4.0|To the joy of youth and imagination, to the art of movie making and to Steven Spielberg and his great block buster films
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I went to bed very late many nights because I could not put it up! As usual, Philippa Gregory has written a fabulous novel.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I had the free version and now have the Pro version with no ads.<br />I like the ribbon, so I can see the numbers I have input.  And I like how clear and simple the calculator is on my screen.<br /><br />It does what it is supposed to do, and does it quite well.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I wasn't much of a fan of &#34;V&#34; is for Vagina (the previous album) - yes, there were a couple that were okay....but this album is MUCH better....so if you're looking to get a Puscifer album, I'd recommend this one.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|A friend got me started watching Doctor Who and now I'm obsessed. You get really interested in the characters and their adventures are always extravagant. Not the best special effects but I learned that they had a lower budget to work with back in 2005 than they do now. I know the quality will get better. But the show as a whole is fantastic!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Really great album!  Can't wait for their second, but it'll be hard to top this one.  Really recommend.  If you like even 1 single you've heard, you'll love the album.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I could not put the book down.  A mixture of social injustice, thrill and friendship wrapped in one. Pick it up, you will not put it down.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I bought this with a really unsure feeling that I'd like it.....I was surprised!  It's a GREAT album!  The first song (intro) is a more like something from a stage play, but past that one & the rest is incredible.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|Not for me every Deep Purple album. My favorites are In Rock, Machine Head, Made In Japan, Burn, Stormbringer, Come Taste The Band, Perfect Strangers, House Of Blue Light, and Bananas. Now after several listens I think I can add this one to the list.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was to long and I'm a child I'm just trying to get my homework done. I could not understand this book and what language is it speaking?
B00CP2Z5TC|2.0|only two good songs, its like they didnt even try for this one.  All there past music was good.  too bad.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The Hobbit is a visually impressive movie with good character development. However, the pace of the of move was slow at times but ended strong with non-stop action.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun,clean app for kids.<br />I recommend it for kids all ages.<br />Everyone will absolutely love this app.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent treatment of the first major change of thinking since the speculative knowledge of the Middle Ages. Part of a valuable growing body of religious insight and perspective.  JAT
B007VTUYWW|4.0|If you like Angelina Jolie, this one is for you. If you like interesting plots and Academy Award acting, skip this one. Not appropriate for all younger audiences. Sexually suggested themes.
B007SPPANM|5.0|For everybody who missed the film, they can get it now.  This is a fictional account of two young people of very different backgrounds, who find one another on the doomed Titanic, among a variety of humanity, from the impoverished to the callous wealthy. The story begins and ends on the Titanic, except in the heart of the one who survives.  The music is inspiring in itself, enhancing the sense of grandiosity the ship embodied.  I would have chosen someone other that DiCaprio for the male lead.  Didn't seem quite authentic.  JAT
B008476HBM|5.0|always feel the need to reread the classics...It's in my blood!!  but the ease of having the kindle app and being able to get books on my ipad from my amazon account ...love love love
B0000060NH|5.0|The cd is very good. But I had to get it from the UK and did not know I was ordering it from the UK. Watch out people.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Makes you want to go back and read all of his books again, with new insight!  Definitely one of my favorites!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|The soundtrack to the movie is exactly that. Done by the actors, the songs they sang. Good music quality and its just fun to listen to Tom Cruise wail like the drugged out banshee he plays.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|The best part of this movie was when I fell asleep. I hate that a great tallent like Tom Hanks appeared in it.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|You really need to pay attention when you read this book! Very stimulating, I kept getting the names of Egyptian gods mixed up, and their history, there should be a glossary!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I like this unit because I rarely have to change batteries. The disadvantages are that it gives a weird hue of light, doesn't stay on but a moment, and doesn't light up a big area. All in all though, I like the light.
1250027624|5.0|She absolutely loved this book.  Pictures were beautiful and she loved reading about the entire process of creating the characters and settings
B001E45XT4|5.0|Been using this gaming set for 2.5 years now. still going strong. Love it. It does make me looks like a dork though.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I usually am dissapointed when I see a movie of my favorite book, but this adaptation is wonderful.  I reccomend it to everyone.
0385334206|3.0|I have read all of Vonnegut's works, and this is my least favorite. I just never really got into it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The acting and costumes are awesome, its a period movie, Loved Tommy Lee Jones in this. If you have a long rainy day, partake :)
B0015AARJI|3.0|Sony is using cheaper materials than the older controllers, and every new controller i get keeps breaking or doesnt give me the best results. The plastic is thinner. The right side of the controller, that you hold in your hand can crack easily just from squeezing the controller. When I press certain buttons too fast it triggers the d-pad. This is very unfortunate. I dont know if I'll order another one (number 3) because I keep getting the same unsatisfactory results.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|There are multiple story-lines twined into one main story. Actors are reused for not main characters, but you will probably not even be able to identify all of them in their various roles. This movie is about reincarnation and how we can change for better or worse. I really enjoyed this movie and do not understand why some of the reviews are so low. Can it get confusing at times? Definitely it does. But stick with it pay attention and keep the stories separate but also keep in mind the overall time line.<br /><br />possible minor spoilers:<br />- 6 different main story lines with 6 different main protagonists (comets).<br />- keep a lookout for the things from the protagonist before each one and what has inspired them from their predecessor.<br />- have fun
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Very enjoyable piece. Loved the clothing and the depiction of that era.  At times it was difficult to hear or understand.  Problem solved with closed caption.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This product has a felt type side that is against your kindle screen when it's closed.  That felt attracts pet hair like crazy. Lint removers and packing tape won't get the hair off. The hair imbeds itself in the fibers. I'm embarrassed to take it anywhere if people might see it.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|One word that comes to mind when I think about this movie...Ick!<br /><br />Nick Cage plays...guess who..Nick Cage. His over acting and a plain stupid script make this a real mess of a movie. With an ugly Mustang with bolt on customizations as the \\"Star\\" of the show. Why guys rave over this silly car is a mystery. Probably because it looks like something you could sling together in your back yard on a Saturday afternoon while slugging down a few cool ones.<br /><br />The bolt on parts look like something right out of the J.C. Whitney catalog. The semi truck running lights are a nice touch. I don't know for sure but this Mustang was probably designed by the same fellow that done the \\"The Family Truckster\\" in the film Vacation. You can almost hear the car cry because of it's shame. At least one thing you can say about the car, it didn't have a choice as to whether to be in this horrific movie or not. Some fool just paid over a million dollars for this POS.<br /><br />I would say it is easily in the top ten worst movies of all time. Cage should be ashamed. But...he got paid, so I suppose that makes it alright with him.<br /><br />If you watch it keep an air sick bag close by. And it would help if you have a lot of cool ones in you before you start.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My husband and I are really enjoying this show.  I love the actors and like the story.  The only reason I rate it 4 instead of 5 is because it is just a bit too much like a soap opera.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|One of the most interesting series that was introduced last year. The best. Watched all the episodes at least twice.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Maintained high expectations for the next revelation.  Hard to imagine a husband that could be mislead for so long even by a very creative wife.
B009POHHRG|3.0|I enjoyed the art but it's it really worth the $11 I paid? I think not though the story was good it was not worth it. This to me  was much more of a regular comic, then to what I consider a graphic novel.
B004SBX112|5.0|My grandson plays this game and he loves it. It works extremely well and the graphics are really good. Thank you
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Truly amazing, I love it when a book can give me goosebumps! The way this one ended, wow I'm glad the fourth book comes out this fall! I haven't been this excited for a book, ever.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie seems to be the pinnacle of Tarantino's work, its like all of his movies rolled into one, if you are a tarantino fan than you must have it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is a really great book and I recommend it to all book lovers around the world forever and always
B008B3MZNI|4.0|Excellent concert - sound was clear and picture sharp.  Would recommend it to all who are Rock music fans.  Supertramp at the top of their game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book glad I read it. I don't have much to say other that thanking for writing these books and the books are always better that the movies.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Ithink this is one of Tom cruises best movies.i am not a big Tom fan but he really came though in this one
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This is a really great app, no glitches. Also if you turn it side ways it turns into a scientific calculator so that was a bonus. The reason I rated it 4 stars is because I do not like how it cuts of the bottom of the numbers in the answer block. Other than that, it is a really great app.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|Great movie. Man is a legend would recommend as it was really cool.good quality image and movie can be paused. In addition you have it for 24 hours.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wonderful book I really enjoyed it I think it was the best in the series. The plot was nice and hard to figure out so you didn't see what was coming next. Though Suzanne Collins has some writing problems because she will cut out the first few words in a sentence and start in the middle. Also sometimes she will change who's eyes you see it from when it only supposed to be Katniss' perspective these two things are why I am giving it a 4 stars though the plot was great!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This was a good read, but clearly not the third book in the Trilogy.  The ending was a shocker and sets the reader up for the next installment, but will there even be another book?????
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books were the best. I rated this one 3 stars because when I finished the book it left me very emotional. She was so broken and sad and dying inside and out that It just made me not like it. Also Suzanne Collins has this writing problem she will start a sentence midway and then when the story is supposed to be written all from Katniss' perspective she will switch like for a minute your in someone else's mind. This book was my least favorite of the trilogy and I think she could have made a bit of a happier ending. I hope you find this review helpful.
B008469DGY|5.0|One of several games I have purchased from full fat. I like this game because you can just pick it up and play whenever. Like if you're on the bus or waiting for a meeting.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I have a Nikon D3100 and fits my DSLR, the charger, among another things...Highly recomended!!!<br /><br />I couldn't expect something better for the price!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is always awesome. The best part of Minecraft is the survival mode, this was the first game I bought on my &quot;Kindle Fire Hd.&quot; If you're wondering why I gave the Minecraft Pocket Addition 4 stars, is because of the controls.  It's hard to turn around sometimes, and my controls are really sensible so sometimes I randomly place blocks. But everything else works fine.  :D
B0091REZMW|5.0|Th&iuml;s is the best mystery search and find game out on Amazon for kindle fire HD!!<br />I haven't had to spend any real money &amp; the game is free!! Pay attention to the reviews, most people like myself are telling the truth! It's an easy to learn and fun game to play!!
B005HSL626|2.0|It was boring my kid don't play it either and that's it<br /><br />So don't get this app ever or any like it
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I watched the first episode of &#34;Hannibal&#34; with the assumption that it would be a rather silly spin-off from the movies using the Hannibal Lechter character as a gimmick. I'm happy to say that I was wrong!<br /><br />First of all, the casting is excellent. I think Mads Mikkelsen is just as good as Anthony Hopkins in the role of Hannibal Lechter, and Hugh Dancy is a very good as Will Graham. Laurence Fishburne, Caroline Dhavernas, and the rest of the cast are also excellent.<br /><br />One of the things that make this show so good is the cinematography. Their amazing use of color and shadow is something I would normally expect to see in a feature film. The use of color is particularly striking, giving the show an almost painterly effect, with some scenes using rich, super-saturated outdoor light and others using a submarine palette of blues and greys and blacks. My only real complaint about the whole show is that they tend to over-use the high speed cloud scrolling shots, but that is just nitpicking. :)<br /><br />TV shows usually suffer from indifferent writing, but so far &#34;Hannibal&#34; has raised the bar. The plots are logical and consistent, with just the right mixture of action, drama, and personality. I haven't even noticed any major continuity flaws, which is very rare.<br /><br />To sum up, &#34;Hannibal&#34; was a pleasant surprise, despite its somewhat gruesome subject matter, and if they can keep this up I'll be very pleased!<br /><br />Oh, one other thing that struck me as funny is that the show has a culinary consultant. As an added bonus it is Jose Andres, one of my favorite chefs, though I may never watch him carve into anything quite the same way ever again. ;)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a beautiful story about illness, life, support, family and love. You will smile and cry while reading this book. It makes everyday problems seem trivial.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is perfect for kids who love to Doodle. Drawing pad has a great variety of markers, colorpencils, stickers,crayons, and 4 erasers. You have all the fun of drawing without wasting paper, and you can send your pictures through e-mail or save them in an album.
B00B769XB8|1.0|Just found this film to be uninspired, forced, boring and unoriginal. Could have been more fun if the writing hadn't been so scattered.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|Just listening again for your birthday. Excellent stuff and bringing back some memories for me!<br />Happy Birthday Pinhead!<br />You still live within your fans.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Great story...unexpected twists and great characters.  I always enjoy Spark's books and the movies that follow.  I will be sure to read his new novel this fall!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a really cute movie.  Great graphics and very entertaining.  All ages will enjoy this movie.  It was good having a young woman as the hero.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great characters, as always. A plot that was unexpected and fun to read. Not one of Grisham's &#34;best&#34;, but a fun way to spend an afternoon nonetheless.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I use Google calendar, and was looking for a way to access it when away from home. I am not tech-savy, and hesitated to try this, but found it easy to use and flawless. It syncs with my account whenever I connect to wifi, and then I have a current version of my calendar with me at all times. I use it on my Kindle Fire.
B00BXLU1EU|4.0|It does exactly what it says it will do what more do you want for the price? So many products these days have to quantify their results but this little app does just what it says it will do.
B008M721MS|2.0|I was using the skype app on my khd for a couple months..there were a few minor glitches but nothing too bad. Now it just straight up doesnt work. It doesnt allow me to even sign it, crashes and thats it. Reinstalled it about 4 times. Please fix this!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game fun to play. Good for killing time. Good for when you are at work or are just bored or whatever.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app, its so relaxing and fun. I love playing. I recommend this game if you love the calm of the sea and the bright colors.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I especially enjoy the character development that has occurred over time as the plot changes and both the upstairs and the downstairs demonstrate their values and personalities.
B00A8307BG|3.0|God I wish Robin could find a vocalist to match his soulful playing. This recording shows me that Robin is still one of the best guitarist of all time. Such great tone and feel. Sadly the vocals on this disc are what you might find on a good local bar band recording. But Robins playing deserves the likes of Dewar (now that was a match made in heaven!) I always dreamed of Robin recording with Paul Rogers but I doubt it will ever happen.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It was a sad and happy story - both main characters are socially inept and emotionally scarred. But it is well written, and pulls on your emotions.
B0012GMW34|5.0|The album was inspired by the teachings of Sri Chinmoy and intended as a tribute to John Coltrane. The year 1973. By this time Carlos had achieved Rock legend status. Santana often exhibited (and still does)spiritual elements in his music. Spirituality is a gentle undercurrent in all the Santana recordings which no doubt set him apart from anything (to some degree) else at the time and was a big part of his and the bands appeal. But by this point he was in very deep--and actually became know as \\"devadip Carlos Santana\\". At the time I thought: really?? What the (hell) is he doing!? This all seemed so pretentious to me. I really had a hard time getting past all the spiritual trappings that he and John were quite overtly bringing to the table. After all we saw the Beatles take a brief trip down that road. But I was just a guitar infatuated teenager at the time and these two were musical giants. To be sure John was/is the most brilliant musician of the two in terms of his technique and fundamental Jazz knowledge. By comparison Carlos was--dare I say--a primitive in the sense that he played more 'straight from the heart'. On one level, you might say, this CD presents kind of an odd pairing. However, spiritual views and individual musicianship aside--once you listen to this recording a few times you quickly realize the genius of it. There really is a deep spiritual aspect to this work that pulls you in. It really 'takes you to church' in the best possible sense of that phrase. These two musicians were at the peak of their game and both on the same spiritual wave length. I have so much more appreciation for this music now than I did 40 yrs ago. It's a much over looked musical gem. And if you're a fan of either of these gentlemen you really should give this a listen.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield is primarily about a special gang unit who deal with the worst elements of society in Farmington, I had to look up where this is and Google maps shows it is in Northern California although the location is obviously in the LA area and they refer to different cities and neighborhoods in LA all the time.<br /><br />I started watching this series on Crackle.com because I thought it was one of their own productions and I've watch some pretty good shows on there in the past. However, they play the same commercial (sometimes three times in a row) multiple times during every episode and there is no way to skip them. I checked on Amazon Prime and the series is available there for free.<br /><br />I don't typically watch cop shows like CSI, NYPD Blues, Cops, or anything like that although I used to watch 24 and I liked it a lot.  However, I've been watching this series when I can. This may just be me, but I think cops behave just like these folks. They want to take 'bad' people off the street but in order to do that, they have to break the law, plant evidence, beat people, murder, etc. and sometimes mistakes are made and good people are harmed.<br /><br />The series is a bit crazy for me because it contains torture, rape, murder, kidnapping, child sex offenders, and essentially the sickest elements of society. I don't like seeing this type of stuff. I know it is just a show, but it seems realistic. Another interesting aspect of the show is seeing the interactions between cops on the same police force and how they harass one another. Some are racist, misogynistic, anti-gay, etc. and how they have to deal with these things in their work environment.<br /><br />I can understand why some police officers seem to be distrustful of citizens. I guess when you deal with lying, deceitful, criminals on a daily basis and are duped by those you trust, you keep your guard up and assume the worst from those you encounter. The Shield shows that some cops are criminals, some turn into criminals, and some try to do the right thing.<br /><br />It's a sick show. I can watch horror movies, combat, or shows with killings because I know it is not real. However, when the violence seems real, it sickens me and I don't want to see that stuff. However, I guess I have this penchant for peeking - kind of like driving by an accident and looking at a corpse. I keep watching this series and have just finished the 3rd season. It's too bad there are 7 seasons because I may squander my time watching more.<br /><br />I haven't seen it stated, but this show should be for mature audiences.<br /><br />Enjoy peeking into the sick world where hopefully most of us don't live.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. I play this game 24/7. It works very well on my kindle fire. Every friend I have boy or girl has this game ,and loves it. I recommend this game for you
B0070Y46UY|2.0|The first part of the book was very interesting and I looked forward to reading further.  But then circumstances changed and it became so gory I thought of not finishing it.  However, I did read it to the end, but I would never recommend it to anyone.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The beginning says I will believe by the end. I believed the story and I suppose that is what was meant. Always look for an inner meaning. Beautifully written, loved every moment.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was a good read for a filler when there is nothing else to read.  It was quite predictable, but still enjoyable.
193700788X|1.0|I'm not going to say anything too dramatic because honestly I'm not a book critic and I don't read that far into things but this last book was BEYOND disappointing. I already have a hard time accepting certain outcomes in books so I've trained myself to get over it and appreciate the story but this time  there was just nothing really to appreciate. Sookie was just settling for less than the best. I got the book last night and stayed up til three reading it, only to go to sleep with an empty void in my chest that was still waiting to be filled. There was no trauma at the hands of a book or great excitement to reread. It was so flat that I literally feel nothing for it. The only way I can describe it is a clusterf***. It was so all over the place and there were so many out-of-commission characters that were brought back that I just didn't know how or when to feel anything, not to mention how far the main characters have strayed from their own personalities. I think the best thing I've seen in these reviews is the theory of a ghost writer because whoever wrote this obviously didn't give a crap about or wasn't focused on the story. She didn't have to end up with Eric but she should've ended up in a way that fit how she was characterized for at least ten books. I'd rather believe in a ghost writer than believe that Mrs. CH left us with this as a final farewell.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I'm glad that I purchased this one instead or renting. It is in the category of must see, and must see again.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|If you are into a movie with lots of action and an outstanding plot then this movie fills the bill.I'm an action movie guy who does look for some period scenery and costumes in a flick as well .Django Unchained has it all .The movie takes me back to some of the old spaghetti  westerns of the late 60s and early 70s that I enjoyed. Great Cinerama photography to boot. A must see film for adult viewing .
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Campy but entertaining. I liked the old style cowboy theme, however, not really a fan of the blood and gore, typical Quentin Tarantino.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is like anything else with its good and bad points.  Maybe you can chat with people you have lost touch with but all the showing off gets on the nerves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait to see Season 4! The period costumes and story line is amazing. Wonderful for all ages. Best drama I have seen in years.
B008220C38|2.0|A bit to artsy for me.  I loved Keira Knightley in &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; but in this, not so much.  Disappointed, certainly expected better.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was an intense but good true story. It starts off rather slow but then the storm!!  We liked it
B0043JDUNS|5.0|This is a great follow-up to the original Iron Man movie.  There is lots of action and enough suspense to keep you interested.  Robert Downey, Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow are a great cast.
B003VANOFY|5.0|bought this at spur of moment for a birthday gift...  they love it. great gaming head phones. hope it lasts
B005K17RU0|1.0|I really liked this app until you changed it now. I don't like the look and it is weird on my screen. why did you change it?
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Easily a good read and could've ended the story with the book.  The only cons in the books were a few grammar errors and the slow start.  I look forward to the next book.
B00846REIS|4.0|I thought it reminded me of \\"fifty shades of grey,\\" yet it took on its own twist of a story!! Looking forward to the next book!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Gregbert says: What an excellent first season if you like the macabre. This is a program that changes what's expected of the new season. I even watch the program beginning credits they're so unique. Though I usually pay no attention to the Television Content Rating System, I'd recommend you at least be aware.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I love how I can turn off the music under settings and listen to my own music on my device!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is one of the few games that really holds my attention.  Worth the download as it always performs well.  You can play a limited amount of the game and then you need to buy.  Haven't done that yet but am going to.
0547569653|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much.  I just finished reading a book by Pam Reed, another ultrarunner, and I must say that hers was the complete opposite of Scott's book.  Scott wrote this book to be an inspiration to other runners.  Pam Reed's book, on the other hand, was written to mostly talk about herself and her emotional and family issues--not inspiring at all.  I hope that Scott Jurek writes another book in the near future.  He is truly an ultrarunning icon!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great series - very good adaptation of the books with great casting, writing, production, etc. The BluRay/DVD+Digital set is really nice.  I just wish Seasdon 2 had twice the number of episodes!
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  David Spade (the emperor) is hilarious and leaves you laughing from start to finish.  I've watched this movie many times since its release and it never gets old.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Watched this the other night on Amazon Prime streaming and decided I MUST have the actual DVD... Just cuz I'm like that!  HA!  Now I can take it with me wherever I go... vacation etc... GREAT, GREAT movie!  I think I saw it about 10 times when it came out in the theaters in 1976.  Still love it now just as much...
B00514HDNW|5.0|I got this book because I saw the movie and loved it.  I am not suprised the book is better then the movie.  I have a friend who loved the movie and wants the book to... now that I've read it
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I was truly impressed and extremely moved by the performances in this marvelous movie.  It's like you were really watching Lincoln the way Daniel Day Lewis portrayed him.  A must have for anyone's DVD library!
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Good review of India.<br /><br />Very boring, unimaginable story. I was surprised to hear that it got nominated for awards. I would pass!
B0029EDMEG|4.0|the jesse movies are well-realized by all concerned. the characters are more real then in most mystery films or TV. And the plots are interesting. the acting is uniformly good. if there were only one, and not a series, it would get major awards.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|It was alright, was not great.<br /><br />Total chich flick, but not much action. Storyline is OK. Could have been more interesting.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|2or 3 instances of vague connections and/or implausibility. For $5 bucks, I recommend as a rental. Tom Cruise excellent action hero.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Frustratingly funny! LuLu slays me every time! The deeper I read into the series the more enhanced the characters become. Do wish she would explore Morelli's fascination with Stephanie a bit more.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|So many of the episodes are still favorites. If you loved the original Star Trek series, Season 2 is a must watch! The Trouble with Tribbles is one of my absolute FAVES!  The stories were well written and many are thought provoking. I can definitely watch them again and again.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I really liked this book. The style of writing was good and pleasurable to read. I laughed and in my heart wished that some of it could be true.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book and for the most part held my interest. I can't wait to see what happens with peers and Kat.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator for simple calculations or if you need one that can handle financial, real estate, school calculations then look no further. This one does it all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very good book.  i saw the movie shortly after I finished reading the book, and I must say the book is 10000 times better.  Although the movie was good, it missed a lot of things.  So if you have seen the movie and have not read the book, READ THE BOOK!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Not many options but okay for taking notes which is all I wanted it for. Fairly simple to use. It's an okay little app.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Fun to play with, wish there was some kind of instruction but it passes time. Anyway they wanted a review.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Very weird movie, who wrote this perverted load of crap. Tom hanks and Halle berry should be ashamed of being in this terrible movie. Very disgusting and odd ball flick. I want a refund!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Well it keeps lists so you know what each number is for, kind of good if its pretty much the same every month, but it just does calculator stuff too.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Another great season. Loved all the father episodes and how they made the characters grow. Made me love each character more. Just have to wait three months to see what happens next!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story line. I enjoyed the plot.  I loved to read it on my Kindle.<br />Buying another book from her.
B00821OX98|5.0|I Love this show<br />I am going to watch all the seasons.  I'm hooked and can't wait to see more.<br /><br />agj
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I love Phantom of the Opera!  The best part of this DVD was the end where all of the Phantoms and the original Angel of Music got together in song!  What I did not like was that the beginning of the DVD had glitches - I need to send it back to get another one. Also, when I went to Indiana, I saw the same DVD on sale for $7.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I bought this item because of so many 4's and 5's in the reviews. It turned out to be a piece of garbage. I was able to scan about 40 slides late one night after I got it. The next day it worked at random scanning.Kept pushing buttons until it finally would scan. Then it might save to memory card or it might not.Then it would turn on, but no picture would show up. Menu might show up, but would have to repeatedly push buttons to get anything to work. It finally would turn on and a blue screen would show up giving the model # and version and that was it. Sent email to manufacturer, told them of proble. They sent me a postage paid label to return the item so they could check it out and say they will send another. Guess I'll have to wait and see.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I love it! Great DVD and actors.  This is my second most favorite presentation - the first is Phantom of the Opera.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|I've used trip advisor city apps on my android phone while traveling and loved them - esp because they work on WiFi and you don't have to pay for a hefty international data plan.  Downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire HD and will probably end up deleting it because it is too hard to read.  The font is too small and there doesn't seem to be a way to increase it.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|thought more of a chick fick! Guys can sit through this without too much discomfort. My women would kill me if I gave this less then 4 stars.
0385349831|5.0|I read this book four times in the first month!  I love it!  I don't like every story Paulo Coelho writes.  But this one I love.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not an avid reader but couldn't put this book down. I can't wait yo start the third book
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Again I paid xtra for this to go with the adapter,the first one the white one did not work at all,this one took as long as connecting it to the kindle and the outlet
B00CL68BK2|4.0|The cast, the story, the soundtrack all good, its a good way to pass the time , entertaining, good work by the director
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Yes, this is a great game, but i thought that somewhere it said that there's a sandbox mode, which doesn't seem to exist....
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Prior to buying this app, my favorite pinball game was Star Trek: TNG. Now one of my all-time favorite movies has a game. It's got not only great audio and fx, but really nice bumper action. There's other tables you can buy and you get to choose it you've playing for the dark side or the rebellion. If you're a Star Wars fan or just pinball, you'll be hooked!
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Is it just me, or is this FREE game only a sample that once you get to a certain point you have to PAY to continue?  Not that great to begin with, because the game play is pretty simple, but then to make me pay for it.  I will pass.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is really fun for me and my friends to compete with each other and have fun with our horses
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is my summer 2013 anthem. Were up all night to get lucky. Were up all night to get lucky.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love it. It's very simple, useful, and stylish. Totally worth it. I love all the different click stylus. My favorite is wordy.
B000IZAHB4|5.0|If you're one of the few who never saw this in its mid ninty's release then you definatly should. This is one of the very few well done and more orignal scary movies that started the transition to just slasher flics and moster movies to much more real world settings where the characters are aware that scary movies exist and the rules of them. A great funny and scary ride.
B007RE0SCW|4.0|bought this for my niece as a gift for her birthday she liked it price was ok wat more can i say about this
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is amazing. It has great gameplay qualities and is just like Call of Duty. It has all the things that you could ask for in a shooter game like this
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|It's about the only movie that attempts to educate the viewer about the period of the Crusades.  It can't give you a comprehensive knowledge of that period but it does introduce you to a few of the names and places of that period.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is really fun i stayed up all night enjoying this game because of all the specail perks u get makes the addictive addictithe graphics on the game is particularly my favorite it puts you in a piece of mind that is relaxiine and intuitive
B00ATPVA78|5.0|omg love the game<br />it is so much fun best game ever!<br />i love the puzzle parts.i love puzzles!<br />i wish there was a 2d one thats how fun it is!
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is the current rock star of statistics and predictions based on the overwhelming accuracy of his forecasts in the 2012 election results.

You can see the same thing on shows that talk about the stock market or sporting events.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Wonderful! I don't know if I was blown away by the ending or if I was saddened by the fact that I was at the end of this beloved series after 3 months of reading them all the way through completely. Either way I was highly pleased. Brandon Sanderson did a wonderful job on the last three books but I am bias as he is easily my favorite fantasy author. I highly reccomend this series, just remeber to stick with them even through the slow and dreary parts as everything is summed up in the end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am not a huge Nicholas Sparks fan... Loved the Notebook, but then again who doesn't?  I find most of his books very formulaic.  However Safe Haven kept me up late into the night reading as I could not put the book down.  I needed to know what was going to happen next.  Very quick and easy read but very enjoyable and you will be satisfied with how the book ends. (even though like all Sparks books it is predictable...)
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Although the &#34;love story&#34; of Jack Jr. is central to plot, it did not need to be central at all.  The story got built around that premise yet it was a weak story.  You could have actually eliminated the done the China Connection without the girl and it would have been just as effective. All in all, a great read.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I ordered this book after seeing it was on the best seller list for so long and after hearing a lot of talk about the book. Maybe it is just me but I was disappointed. I hate when I invest time in a book only to get to the end and am left feeling that the author thought &#34;oh shoot I have a deadline to make, let me end this book in the easiest  most obvious way possible...&#34;  Story was good until the last two  chapters when it fell flat for me.  Story could have gone in many different directions and it just didn't happen....
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I was not sure going in to watching this program, I'm not much into this sort of thing, however it was quit entertaining. Its like a viking soap, with good looking guys. I will probably keep watching just to see were it goes. Very entertaining.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|and will get all their CDs, wish they were in the NY Metropolitan area often.  Saw them at The NY POPS at Carnegie hall, what a treat
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I'd like to think that even before watching this film, I was a very aware consumer! However I had a few VERY eye opening moments... one of which was the treatment of the animals! I do not believe that all meat cunsumption is bad or evil. When I saw the way the chickens and cows are treated as a whole it changed my view on things! When a person can stand by and witness and INFLICT such cruelty on anouther living thing it genuinely makes me sick to my stomach! I just hope that people seeing this film will change things for the better!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have read the whole series so I had to get this one.  Big Big waste of money.  I had to force myself to read the first couple of chapters.  It does get a little bit better, but there is no depth to this book at all.  Didn't draw me in like the others.  Save your money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A must see series.  Masterpiece does it again with a fabulous series.  Great costumes, superior filming, super acting.  Job well done.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|The novel covers the same territory as The White Queen but from the perpective of different characters. It's hard to explain the problems with this book without spoilers.  The main character, Lady Anne Neville (famed for being the wife of Richard III, who was historically rumored to have poisoned her but probably did not) as well as her sister, Isabella seem stable enough but as the story progresses one wonders.  The handling of the antagonist, Queen Elizabeth Woodville, is strange and the plot casts last minute doubts on the respective naturesof the various characters.  A chief focus of the novel is one particular relationship, which is all but abandoned at the end, going out with a fizzle rather than a bang and with no real resolution for good or ill.  As usual, Gregory makes use of her habit, both in narration and dialogue, of repetition, which can be effective but is often annoying, especially since she has &#34;everyone&#34; talk that way.  (For example [these are not an exact quotes] &#34;He is the King, he is our King, he is the King of England&#34; or &#34;I am free, I am free to do what I want, I am a free person.&#34;])  It's entertaining in parts and the love story is interesting as it gets started, but it's not as well written as my favorite novels by Gregory, The Boleyn Inheritance and The White Queen.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|Good movie & acting very entertaining to watch. A story about the trials & tribulations of Johnny Cash's singing carrier & devotion to his wife June Carter.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Absolutely the best season of Castle yet.  I can not wait to see how the cliff hanger finale is resolved.
1426209584|5.0|Fabulous.  Wish it was also in paper back.  Or just the pictures.  I would have liked to send it to a guide in PNG but this book is too heavy and too expensive and besides they couldn't carry it around in their back pack as a reference!!
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I watched the movie first - which was interesting and sparked the interest to read the book - as we know, you can never really get all of the nuance of a book into a movie...<br /><br />The book is written in the form of letters from Eva to her husband. The premise is initially that you feel that the couple has split up and the son Kevin is to blame.<br /><br />The harsh reality is, of course, that Kevin has done some terrible things and as we get through the book - they come to light.<br /><br />While I liked the book - I found the in-depth self and familial examination to be long winded. I suppose I found myself saying \\"OK, I get it\\" and the 'letter' would go on for another several pages. Don't get me wrong - it's good stuff and feels totally real - the detail and the issues explored are gripping and honestly frightening. I felt at many points like I wanted to shake the husband and say - \\"Why can't you see this!?\\"<br /><br />It really is an excellent examination of a disfunctional (at least to some degree) American family. The focus of daily family life, the realization that the parents truly do not understand what their son is all about and that this lack of understanding and alarm on their part leads to the tragedy that underlies the story.<br /><br />Towards the end it really became very solid and the pace picked up quite a bit. It really makes the reader wonder what would have happened if the parents had pursued mental health assistance for Kevin and where it would have led (not to a book ;)<br /><br />Well done and gripping.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It's rare that I enjoy a book based film as a good retelling of the book itself.  The Lord of the Rings movies, as an example, were all fine fantasy movies on their own but I thought they did a poor overall job retelling the books.  Yes you get the idea...bad guy makes bad ring, little guy goes on a quest to destroy the bad ring.  But 'getting the idea' doesn't make the movie a good retelling any more than my description was.<br /><br />The Hunger Games, on the other hand, was a marvelous retelling of the book.  Yes you will still find differences (Katness finding the Mockingjay pin at a marketplace rather than getting it as a gift from the mayors daughter - who was cut entirely from the story). But most every important aspect seemed in place and well told.<br /><br />If this surprises anyone, it shouldn't.  This is the kind of magic that can be accomplished when the movie producers work closely with the books author.  Hope they do as well with Catching Fire.

B00847VY92|5.0|I didn't read Pollyanna Grows Up until I was grown up, though I read Pollyanna as a child.  I enjoy both stories and look forward to my girls reading them.  This edition is easily read on a Kindle.  I had no issues with it whatsoever.<br /><br />This story is about Pollyanna's life mostly when she's 12-13 years old and then it makes a big jump (skips 6 or 7 years of her life) and then when she is 20 years old.  The story flows surprisingly well considering it makes such a big jump in a few pages.  Of course it has a happy ending.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Pollyanna, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one.

B00A8MGLAI|2.0|I spent almost 3 hours watching this movie and I still can't tell you what it was about. While it was interesting to see the different characters in different makeup and situations, the movie was just too confusing to follow. I guess I kind of expected something more that made a little sense from Tom Hanks. This movie is going to be filed in my movie collection and probably never watch again, since I barely made it through the first time.

B003WKLOTQ|5.0|My toddlers and I watch this documentary all the time, and it never fails to make us all smile. They love to talk about what the babies are doing, and how things they do are very similar. We hum the music frequently!

B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Once I heard a few songs off the debut Vampire Weekend album, I was hooked immediately. They came out like a blast of fresh air, boasting a carefree wink and a smile delivery. I've listened to the debut many times and still enjoy it. However, Contra came along, had a few jewels, but overall I could not get into it.<br /><br />Here, on Modern Vampires, there is a definite purpose felt throughout from the beginning of the first notes. It feels like they set out to make something meaningful that would hold up years from now. It was a risky move, because it might've wound up sounding forced and pretentious. Gladly, it all works together. Everything fits together as a complete album. I applaud this considering the music industry is currently fixed into releasing singles instread of stand alone albums.<br /><br />With Vampire Weekend, I'm drawn more to the uptempo, stomp along songs. Thankfully they've not completely discarded this element. \\"Unbelievers, Diane Young, Finger Back, and Worship You\\" are the tracks that fill this desire. One of my favorite tracks is \\"Hudson\\", a hauntingly beautiful song that stretches beyond anything they've ever attempted.<br /><br />In short, this is a densely layered, atmospheric album that invites repeated listens to fully appreciate. It IS a grower. Took me about 5-7 listens all the way through to form my opinion. This is a crazy good album.
B0044WQHA2|5.0|A nostalgic homage from george Lucas about a time where souped up cars drag raced, cruised the strip and teenage angst, mischief and rebellion were the norm.

B00932A4XE|1.0|I am not a movie reviewer however I am a music reviewer/critic so I am going to apply some of the same principals here, where possible. I recognized four names in the cast Cameron Diaz ( A Semi Talented actress when the script is good), Jennifer Lopez (Amazingly Talented on the big screen and on Stage Singing & Dancing), Dennis Quaid (Good Solid Actor with a career that has spanned many decades) and Chris Rock (Good Actor and Funny).<br /><br />My first thought about 10 minutes into the movie was this is the worst script I have seen in a long time. No I do not watch many movies or even TV based movies mainly for that reason, poor writing. Creativity seems to have died with my generation and all we get anymore is recycled poorly written clones of what was written pre 2000.<br /><br />When I do watch something, if/when I have two hours in a row to spend, which is very rare, I prefer to watch in this order, comedy, true stories about musicians (the world I live in), fast paced action, and sci-fi.  I was in need of comedy, I wanted to laugh and laugh hard but there wasn't anything funny in this movie. Not only wasn't it funny it was sadly predictable. They took stereotypes of the world we live in and shows people watch on TV and created junk. A very much waste of the talented actors in the movie.<br /><br />I do not watch reality shows because I make my own reality but that is what the world is stuck on these days so the opening sequence of a pseudo \\"Dancing With The Stars\\" wasn't a shocker, and when Cameron Diaz puked well that was about the funniest part of the movie. It baffles me to no end how EVERYONE throws around this phrase constantly \\"I am over the drama, I can't take drama and avoid it at all cost\\" then they set their DVR's so they do not miss their long list of reality shows, which isn't really reality by the way. What are these reality shows? In a word DRAMA however the public has it confused with comedy. This generation is totally driven on drama but can't handle what is real in their own life calling it drama so for entertainment they watch garbage drama that others pretend to live, AND believe me it is not real.<br /><br />To be completely honest I didn't even watch the entire movie after about an hour I had enough. There was nothing entertaining at all in the movie. The plot was missing. The humor was no where to be found. The acting was poor at best, but to be fair there is only so much one can do with a bad script.<br /><br />I stopped the video and watched 21 Jump Street for the 3rd time, now that is funny.handle what is real in their own life calling it drama so for entertainment they watch garbage drama that others pretend to live, AND believe me it is not real.<br /><br />To be completely honest I didn't even watch the entire movie after about an hour I had enough.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|Graeme Simsion has cracked the greatness seal with this book. Don, his main character, is so fundamentally flawed, he should be impossible to like. This book is not one to read in the quiet carriage, as it's full of big laughs, often at Don's expense. It's an easy and cruisy read, but nicely written for all that. A perfect Read-In-A-Weekend book.<br />I wouldn't be at all surprised to see this book made into a film - it has all the hallmarks of a great movie story.<br />I'm also really proud that this story is set in and around Melbourne - and love the little glimpses of my home town.<br />You could buy this book for almost anyone - my 14 year old daughter loved it, and my Mother (who is admittedly a bit of a groover) enjoyed it too. Now my husband is reading it!

I am going to say, without exageration that I have seen it at least twice a year for every year of my life and I never get tired of it.<br /><br />You can keep all of the fairy tale, princess type movies, redundent and tired old zombie movies, and all the slash and gore junk.  This is a science fiction movie with an actual plot/story line, good acting, and a real moral message!<br /><br />Throw in Robby the robot and you just can't loose!

B005MLOKXA|5.0|Interesting characters, interesting situations.  All aspects of life and viewpoints portrayed without bias; without demonizing one over the other.  Characters are solid and don't bounce around from episode to episode, meaning, one time they are one way and on the next show another way.  They carry with them the repercussions of their actions and decisions, whether good or evil.  Very refreshing and real with depth of issues and personalities.  Thanks!  Also, the variety of actors and actresses that show up for particular episodes is a very nice touch!!!

0062183591|4.0|This book was pleasant to read. however i found more content in \\"Lecture:Why People Lie\\" and that book is only about 10 pages long. I don't know, i guess its just me.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|As I was watching this movie, I was recollecting the newspaper articles I'd read about the \\"true events\\" that inspired it.  It's a strange, strange story and it seems to me that the screenplay tried to make it less strange by psychologically profiling David Marks (fictional name, played by Ryan Gosling), a character who is put on trial for murdering a neighbor two decades after his wife disappears.  The trial brings into question David's past -- including his myseriously missing wife -- and is the device used to tell his life story.  The film takes the stance that David ultimately gets away with three murders, but it also focuses on his disturbing childhood and strained relationship with his very wealthy, well-connected and corrupt father (played by Frank Langella), a New York State real estate mogul with political pull.  I felt like I was supposed to walk away from the film with a greater understanding of why David was a pyschopath, but honestly I didn't care that much about him -- I cared about his wife, Katie, played incredibly well by Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />Katie is a key character, but her relationship with David isn't explored enough to satisfy me.  This may be because it's David who's telling the story.  The scenes we're shown during his testimony do provide insight into his abusiveness towards her.  What they don't do is explain what the heck Katie was thinking; her family is present throughout the film, but her social life prior to meeting David isn't incorporated at all and no one questions the earnestness with which she initially devotes herself to him.  She's more like a pawn, or a plot device, than a fully fleshed out person.  It's intimated that she likes David's money, but she also seems to really like him, which doesn't make sense.  Katie is beautiful and smart enough to get into med school; David isn't particuarly physically attractive and his character has zero personality and ambition (this isn't \\"The Notebook\\").  The time line is weird too.  Katie and David are married in 1972 and when it seems like only a few years have gone by, it's suddently 1982.  And the couple seems to be as unfamiliar with each other as they were a decade before.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, David goes from being someone with \\"issues\\" to a full-fledged pyschopath.  Eventually, he starts dressing in women's clothing.  Yet it's all pretty boring. I think this has to do with the constraint of David being the narrator.  He tells the story he wants everyone to believe -- he is on trial -- while we're shown the \\"actual\\" (according to the screenplay) events as only he would know them.  The film does let us in on too much by showing scenes in which David doesn't appear, which is a  common and forgivable transgression.  But it never truly veers far enough from David's point-of-view to be thrilling or achieve an effective level of depth.  He claims he's dressing as a woman because he doesn't want to be recognized,and that's that.<br /><br />The scenes that are the most revealing are the ones between David and his father, which makes sense since the movie is about David.  But Katie (Kirsten) is the one who shines and the one in whom I was invested.  There's a lot of viewing time left after she disappears, and she really just disappears.  It left me feeling that the movie was uneven and didn't fulfill its full potential.  Kirsten Dunst certainly fulfills her potential in this movie with a truly excellent performance that should have garnered more attention.  For a supremely good movie along the lines of \\"All Good Things,\\" see \\"Reversal of Fortune\\" starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close -- a dramatization of the real-life appeal of Claus van Bulow's attempted murder conviction for putting his heiress wife in a permanent vegetative state.  Mr. Irons won an Oscar for his performance.
0061785652|5.0|I really like all of James Rollins' books, but this one is the bomb. He outdid himself on this storyline. I have appreciated how, at the end of his books, he ties up history and fiction. I learned a lot from the historical perspective with this book. His writing is crisp and clear and fast paced. You can't ask for more! Great book and a great author!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I think of this movie as \\"Rachel Getting Married\\" meets \\"Jerry Maguire.\\"  There are people with really serious behavioral health issues, and then there is the neat little bow in which the screenplay seeks to tie up those issues, in the form of a love story.  To me, the family dynamics are the most interesting aspect; there are flashes of really great moments between Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Nero as son and father, respectively.  As others have pointed out, the scenes with the family can be difficult to watch -- there is a lot of yelling and physicality between the characters (laced with humor to keep things more edgy than off-putting).  It's clear that Cooper's \\"Pat\\" isn't the only member of his clan who can benefit from therapy.  Despite the film's emphasis on being positive and its comedic infusions, there's a lot of heavy stuff here -- which is why to me, the rather rapidly paced love story seems out of place.  The movie isn't about a guy going through a mid-life crisis, it's about someone grappling with mental health issues.  It doesn't seem like handing him a \\"you complete me\\" moment is going to fix that. I'll stop there because I don't want to to take away from how well-acted the movie is and I totally respect the fact that many, many people enjoyed it much more than I did.  I think it comes down to a matter of preference: If you're looking for a darker but still \\"Hollywood\\" romantic comedy, then you'll probably enjoy this film very much.  If you're expecting a less mainstream touch, then you might be disappointed.

B001AOKA3W|1.0|I was wondering why I hadn't seen this movie yet...and now I'm wondering why I did.  It is not good.  In order for this type of movie to work, there needs to be some level of buy-in from the viewer.  I'm not talking about suspension of disbelief -- a monster taking over Manhattan is pretty hard to believe.  But the storyline needs to be solid enough for the viewer to WANT to believe.  I just saw ridiculousness everywhere.  First there are the holes regarding the presence of the video camera that supposedly provided the content of the film.  For some reason, one of the main characters, Rob, had it in his possession during an impromptu one night stand with his best gal pal, Beth, at her apartment. (He used it to film their next day together, not their night, so don't get any ideas.)  I got the impression that he worked in finance or something of that ilk, as he was being transferred to Japan, and was not a documentarian.  About six weeks later, Rob's brother, Jason and Jason's girlfriend, Lily, have this same camera, which belongs to Rob, in their possession to film Rob's going away party.  Rob's best friend, Hud, ends up with those duties and captures the group's night-long efforts to save each other from/escape the inexplicable monster that is desroying the city.  There is no reason for Hud, who is also not a documentarian, not to have dropped the camera during the mayhem other than to give this movie a reason for being.  Apparently the writers noticed this problem because it was explained away by Hud stating that filming the events was a good distraction from them, or something like that.  In addition to the camera's bizarre ubiquitousness, I was surprised by its exceptional performance and fortitude during the night's trials and tribulations; it survives as a prize possession as everyone is getting mauled.  Also, and this might be nit-picky, but given the level of damage to the city, the power outage that occurs probably wouldn't have been so brief, except an actual power outage would have posed cinematic problems.  In addition, Rob receives a well-signaled cell phone call in the subway while the U.S. military is grappling with the chaos the monster is causing above ground even though circuits were previously jammed; this is quite fortuitous (getting a text message through maybe -- but a full-fledged phone call underground under these circumstances???).  Lily is adept at walking literally miles of subway track in high heels which she finally takes off when she has to climb multiple flights of stairs; at this point she would've have two sprained ankles.  I don't want to delve too deeply into the story and ruin it for those who do want to watch, so to sum things up, in my opinion, the \\"Godzilla\\" movies are more realistic.  I'm sure \\"Cloverfield\\" fans can explain away all of the things that I interpreted as ridiculous, but the fact is, I found them to be distracting.  Granted, they might be more distracting for those of us who are familiar with the lay of the land in NYC.  If you really enjoy the \\"found footage\\" trope to the point where you can forgive a thin and flawed storyline, then this movie might work for you.  It didn't for me.  And I'm a huge fan of the horror genre so it's not like I need things to be realistic -- I do need them to pull me in as opposed to keeping me at arm's length, noticing how silly they are.

B00AHGSVKS|4.0|This book was very unpredictable and I liked the way it kept  changing into almost different stories that took you in different directions.I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoys science fiction.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is a great app for amazoniacs like myself. I love having mobile access to my favorite shopping website. I coupled this app with a scanner app and use it to find better deals online. In this economy, saving money is huge. I appreciate that this app makes it easier!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A story about trust.  A good man is hard to find.<br />She found him but she did not know she could trust him so much.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love having a flashlight in my hand when I need it. It's perfect for emergency situations when you don't know where to find a light.
B008220C56|2.0|I tried very hard to get through this movie. Really! I had just paid $24.99 for the Blu Ray and as such, was going to watch this movie all the way through even though I was bored stiff with it. I just didn't get the theatre motif! Even watching this movie though a high end home theater system with the Blu Ray DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio soundtrack didn't do the trick. I do give it some stars for the lavish costumes and the acting was good. I just couldn't stand the stage sets. Just like another review has stated, I too rooted for the train just to end this.<br /><br />For those expecting some lavish remake of the famous Greta Garbo film of the same title will probably be disappointed. The 1935 film is much better and recommended. Better yet, just read the book by Leo Tolstoy which is outstanding literature.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We saw this in theaters and it was awesome now we own it!!! totally awesome and very cute and kid appropriate
0312019602|5.0|I had loaned this book to a friend out of my set and never got it back. I ordered this specific book to replace the one in my set and it was exactly like the one I had before. I couldn't be happier.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the stories love the characters and of course the Drama!!  Its a juicy soap opera i cant wait until the 3 rd season is free!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Since I watch the  TV show &#34;Bones&#34; every chance I get (even the reruns), reading this was great.  I was surprised that the story was placed in Canada, but I did love the French.
B005VPXNV2|5.0|How could any story by the great author Stephen King be a flop. Yeah i know the story is not always followed closely, but whereas you can take a month to read the book there is only about two hours to tell the story. Kathy Bate and James Caan were excellent choices for the starring roles. They brought depth and roundness to the characters. The flashes of insanity by Bates was frightened and the lengths she took to satisfy  her obsession with the character &#34;Misery&#34; were brilliant as well as horrifying.. The courage and cunning on the part of the author were inspiring. It was a great &#34;read.&#34;
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I was really impressed with this game. The game play is great and the graphics are even better. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because of the voice acting. It is bad. Ok Ok its terrible, but it can certainly give someone a quick laugh. Overall good game
B00CL67E32|5.0|Note: I saw all the episodes in HD via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />The newest television show from FOX about a serial killer and the ex-FBI Agent tortured by his past with him as he races to stop him grabs you from the first episode, and doesn't let you go until the final frame of the shocking season finale. Kevin Bacon is sharp-as-a-tack and tormented by his own demons, and James Purefoy is Hannibal Lecter with a twist.<br /><br />Every episode is worth it.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Superb love story. Highly recommended to fans of EL James. Gideon is even more fun than Christian Grey!<br />I had a very nice time and eagerly await part three!
0765334798|5.0|\\"What I want right now is to be the person who decides my own fate\\"<br /><br />Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Intrepid, the flagship of the Universal Union. Quickly he realizes something is wrong - the lower ranked officers that are sent on away missions end up dead. The captain, his science officer, the chief engineer, the chief medical officer, and the astrogator, however, always come out alive. What's going on and can Dahl get to the bottom of this?<br /><br />How can I possibly describe my experience with \\"Redshirts\\"? I've finished it a couple of minutes ago (after tearing through the book in record time - and I should mention, I am probably one of the slowest readers in the world), and my heart has been torn out of my chest and is lying limp on the floor. I've laughed my @ss off, I've been glued to the edge of my seat, and now I'm blinking away tears at the poignant ending.<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" is a parody, a satire of the cheesy science fiction television. It pokes fun at the cliches in \\"Star Trek\\" and other science fiction series. It points out the bad science, the plot holes, the bad characterization, the silly events that happen in the worst of science fiction - and yet never does it become condescending or outright mean to what it is parodying.<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" is a commentary on writing. It's a reminder to authors to keep up at the top of their game, to not get lazy, to not treat the characters cheaply but also not to be afraid to sometimes pull the plug. It's a reminder that the audience isn't filled with a bunch of dumb idiots that need to be talked down to. It's a reminder that good art takes work.<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" is a commentary on life. What does it mean to be real or fictional? What is important? Who is important? Does it matter if love is fictional if it is love?<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"Redshirts\\". Maybe not \\"Ready Player One\\" \\"I want to make your baby\\" Love, but definitely \\"You can be my wingman anytime\\" Love. \\"Redshirts\\" rode that balance of contemplative and funny; tongue-in-cheek and serious; fictional and real.<br /><br />The writing style took some getting used to; there aren't many descriptors, and it's hugely dialogue heavy (expect to read the word \\"said\\" A LOT). But there's a reason for that - and when I got to that reason, I was like, \\"OMG, Scalzi's the most brilliant man in the world!\\"<br /><br />I loved the characters. Sure, I wish there were more women, and I had some idea what they looked like. But the point of this book is to poke fun at the scifi TV cliches; plus, the women that were here were very well developed and just as interesting (and important!) as the men.<br /><br />I loved the story. The main story made me think just enough to blow my mind; the codas lent a fascinating conclusion to the main thread. I personally liked the first coda and the last (tore my heart out, it did) best; I'm not sure the second person point of view worked well in the second coda, but it certainly is not the worst I've read.<br /><br />And really, I don't have much more to say. I guess I could try to delve deeper, but honestly, I think it'll be more fangirling than anything. If you want to laugh, to think, and possibly to cry, then check out Scalzi's \\"Redshirts\\".<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The author is gifted at creating interesting, believable characters, not to mention, weaving a riveting story line. While doing this she exposes the evils of a once accepted sadistic orphanage, (now a thing of the past ) and the damage it did to the children who had to live there. In spite of how it sounds, it has a hopeful message and touches of humor. By all means, READ IT!!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Things are working really great , really pleased. I am so glad I can receive my EMAIL on my kindle fire HD.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Go and watch the first Die Hard film. It's ok, I'll wait. Now, save your money on this awful film. You've had a good time, no need to spoil it with this. Let me save you some trouble by breaking it down for you - A Good Day to Die Hard brings John McClane (played once again by Bruce Willis, looking very bored) back to movie audiences. This time he needs to go to Russia to bail out his son Jack (played by Jai Courtney) who, it turns out, can hold his own in a fight. Together, father and son must face off against Russian terrorists looking for a file that would make them all look bad. What is on the file is really not that important to the filmmakers. There's a car chase that appears to destroy half of Russia without much consequence to our heroes, several shoot outs, and fights in Chernobyl. Nobody seems to realize they would need to wear masks just to go near it. Given the property damage and loss of life incurred, it becomes difficult to imagine that McClane isn't wanted by Interpol at the end of the film. The viewer will also notice that the film is really just a series of action scenes with a bare bones plot to tie it all together. If you were to view these scenes out of order you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. After you have all the explosions and wrecked buildings, just add Bruce Willis repeating certain lines over and over at various points in the film (\\"I'm on vacation!\\" is one example) and you have something that the discerning movie goer hopefully didn't shell out $10 to see in theaters.<br /><br />There was a time when the DIe Hard movies were fun, escapist, entertainment. In 1988, John McClane had something to say. In 2013, Bruce Willis just wants his money. Originality dies slowly and painfully. It's hard to watch.<br /><br />(A side note: I don't really believe the positive reviews below were done by real people. It pays to get wise to these marketing ploys trying to sell a film to viewers when the studio knows its crap. Don't buy in.)
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I am a fan of Joel Schumacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Gerard Butler (300).  Who knew Gerard could sing?  He's good.  This is the best \\"Phantom\\" I've seen.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Was easy to view on laptop.  The images are crisp the audio clear.  The rental is for 48-hour time frame.
B0041D843M|4.0|Excellent info. It could have been a little more condensed, there is a bit of repetition.  That said, this book is changing my life.  I am a diabetic and since adopting a plant-based diet, my blood sugars have improved dramatically.  In 7 weeks of being vegan, I have lost 22 pounds and I eat as much as I want of plant foods.  It is really wonderful!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci never disappoints.  I love his character Will Robie.  The book kept me in suspense, and I am looking forward to his next book The Hit.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks weaves a wonderful, intriguing story! A dear friend of mine has just received a liver transplant. That made this story even more special for me.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is fun and addicting!  The graphics are wonderfully done and even the music is nice.  Very good app!
B000FC1PNE|5.0|Enjoyed this series with Peter Davison as a caring, love able but dogged detective.  Peter Davison is a great in this series.
B00C2C637I|4.0|My recommendation is based on my residual feelings of the story and Ray Bradbury in general. I loved his poetic way of weaving a tale that didn't just leave the reader with good guys and monsters. He had sympathy for most of his monsters. In this story there are evil characters, misguided adults, heroic young people, and a mix of all those things. I think this story is great for someone 8 to adult. I would have given it 5 stars, but I realize things that were loved as a child might not hold the same weight many years later, so I wanted to reread it and see how close I came to how I feel about it today. I hope to relive some of the eerie and scary feelings I had then.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A gripping story that took me back in time to the Iran Hostage Crisis.  I didn't remember this particular part of that crisis, and was very interested in learning of the brave peOple who helped save these people.  Ben Affleck did a great job with this movie.
B00881PTRC|3.0|I like word games but this one is dull to me. I did like the options, multiple word lists to choose from and the option to create your own list. You can choose the action too (Traditional Hangman, flower, or snowman). It just wasn't to my liking.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Haven't seen a James Bond movie since Diamonds Are Forever.  Daniel Craig is terrific.  Loved the new Q.  Judi Dench never fails.  May actually start viewing JB movies again.
B006M4F67A|5.0|A classic game available on my kindle fire! I adore the rating stars under the layouts, I challenged myself to improve my time on the puzzles. Thanks 24/7. I have several of their versions and adore the unique layouts in their seasonal versions of this game.
B000FA675C|5.0|Enjoyed the Robert Langdon series.  I think Angels and Demons was actually better, but this was still an enjoyable story.
B00846WWVM|3.0|also an exercise in frustration. I enjoyed the first few levels but that was about it. Perhaps my frustration tolerance level is set too low.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Story of a teenager with real problems, questions and confusions. People of the story are all believable though they are presenting different sort of teenage issues!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is type of game you can play over and over.  My kids and myself love it.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention...but I was confused how the various stories from various eras had anything to do with anything other than some vague similarities which had more to do with the same actors playing the parts and the occasional birth mark, etc etc.  Also besides the story being confusing I absolutely hated the Jar Jar Binks like silly language they spoke.  It made it near impossible to watch in Star Wars and nearly impossible to watch in this flick.  So I was not blown away by this movie and it certainly was not worht a second watch, which is what others claimed would help pull the stories together.  Watch this movie twice...not likely.  As for me not paying attention...yes if I paid more attention I might have figured out some of it but it just didn't capture my attention.  Kind of like calculous...yes I would have gotten an A instead of a B had I paid more attention...BUT IT WAS BORING!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|My husband and I have been on this diet for a month now and it works!  I have lost 10 lbs and he has lost 12.  The book was easy to read and had lots of recipes for meals.  This is a life-style change that I plan to stick with - I feel much better and have more energy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The usual caliber of par excellence is continued!!  I just LOVE the show and all the plots and subplots make it the fine show that it is!!!!!!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I'm not sure how we survived without this. When we would go to theme parks, all of our phone batteries would die before the day ended. It was hard to find a free outlet to plug in the charger. We charged 3 phones from 5% to 100% and still had power left to charge again if needed. If you have a cellphone, you need this battery pack.
1476712042|5.0|when i first got this book i wasn't so sure but I am very glade that I did. it became one of my 2013 good reads. I defiantly fell in love with all the Characters in the book, you just cant help but fall in to the world of Beautiful Disaster.  couldn't put it down once I stared to read.
193700788X|1.0|anticlimactic, lazily written, all of the major characters were hardly mentioned.SPOILER: she ends up with Sam?! Sure hes a nice guy, but so was Calvin. Whats wrong with Alcide or Bill or Eric? I am personally biased towards Eric but anyone but Sam? She has zero chemistry with him. I felt like she spent so many books and so many years creating this beautiful relationship between Sookie and Eric, just to rip them apart. Eric gets forced into a marriage and doesn't even fight, Sookie doesn't fight for him. And we never really find out whats going on in Vampire Business. I am sooo disappointed and I will never buy another book bv Charlaine Harris again. I do not recommend this book. Go check it out from the library, but don't waste your money.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Don't call yourself a Trekie if you haven't see this. As required, I am adding ten more useless words, there.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to get focused, hard to turn away from playing! I can't wait to earn enough for the unicorn! This is an easy way to distract kids for a while.
1439130833|4.0|This daily teaching is a good reminder for those that read the book.  Anyone that hasn't read the book may not care for it as much. But the belief that positive energy creates positive energy really happens.
0891419063|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars. The real in depth personal view of what really went on in the pacific war.<br />Recommend to WW2 Readers.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I originally watched this series on a black and white TV.  Now its in color and HD!  It boldly goes where no original series has gone before.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Best app ever!  It is tricky but easy at the same time and I love how it's I spy and local at the same time!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|ok if u loved finding nemo as much as I do you will love this game you don't have to pay money but you can u just have to be careful its a fun easy game that you will want to play all the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app! It is so awesome! It is so worth $3.99. If you purchase this app you will love it to.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Moves along quite well.  More Character development would have been nice. Has some very interesting plots. It keeps your attention..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say?  Fify Shades of Grey would make a great manual for the man in your life. It is explicit but not sleazy. It's well written with just enough description and detail. Leaves you to your inmagination. Christain Grey's character is a bit hard to believe due to the fact that he is so handsome, sexy, wealthy, etc. Makes my boyfriend look like milk toast. The end of the book leaves you hanging, therefore, you must read the other two. Well worth it.
193700788X|1.0|I have been a huge fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series since the beginning.  Dead Ever After was highly disappointing.  At best it was inconsistent blather, focusing on forgetting what was written in the previous volumes and listing what Sookie bought, baked, or wore. The story went no where and ended no where near anything that was so carefully set up in previous volumes. Character assassination was rampant- a cheap trick. And where did Sam come from?  There was no set up for that at all.  It was just shoved down our throats with a couple of pages left. Very disappointing.  Waste of time and money.  The upside is that with the way it ended, I won't miss it at all.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This is supposed to be good for teens-it covers every topic in the worst way:drug use, sex, alcohol, abuse of females, abortions, mental illness etc. but offers no solutions or anything that can positively change any of it.  Kids should be aware of all of these things, but this book has no redeeming quality in the way it is all discussed.
0811879542|5.0|my niece and nephew loves it.....perfect little magic book for them.. they enjoyed it...got the book on time and in very good conition
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I saw the film years again. And I wanted to buy it to be able to watch it again and again. It is a classic. One of the best films ever.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book throws you into thrilling and heartbreaking scenes!  I love this book!A must read!I can't wait to read the next book!If your a Rick Riordan fan you WILL love this book!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Wow, great album.  So many different styles.  Its nice to artist not singing about money, cars & clothes. Buy it
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Price was way better than anything my brother saw locally or on eBay. He was able to get this and the cubes for the same price as just this item was... Great deal, prime shipping!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|This DVD is edited, they cut out the best dance scene and a few other memorable scenes as well.  No where in the description does it say this is not the entire movie.  Sorry to say don't waste your money on this version, I was really looking forward to the theater version.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|It felt like an amateurish attempt at some good, old movies. It seems they put in big stars to cover up how dumb the movie was
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I actually like this better than Gwyneth Paltrow's version.  Romola is clever, mischievous and perky.  I love the show Elementary, so prefer Mr. Knightly in this.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Never could follow the Doctor before, a friend recommended the new series. It's better written and more accessible than earlier Doctors (At least to me). I enyoed it and am working my way through the new series as I speak.<br /><br />Try it, even if you didn't like it before. It's worth it,
B004UNX1LS|2.0|As for the technical side of things, the app ran fine (on a Kindle Fire) although it was a little slow.<br /><br />It's even free which is a plus.<br /><br />However, there's not a lot of room for personalizing your music. The only thing on the home page is pop, and if you don't like that kind of music you have to deal with it because<br />they don't offer any way to customize your home screen.<br /><br />The only thing that come close to personalizing something is adding a playlist; however the app doesn't take this into account when suggesting videos to watch. I also tried logging onto facebook,<br />but that didn't help either.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great idea but it'd be better if you could personalize it to fit your music style.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The world of cloning has never been so Sexy ...Sexy Characters with Devious story lines ...I'm Loving this series keep it going

0316228532|2.0|J K Rawlings has a special talent for storytelling that has brought readers, young and old, back to reading.  Her talent is so precious that I loathe to see her demean herself by writing such trash.  Many times I was tempted to discard the book but, because I'm not a quiter, perservered to the end.<br /><br />For me, the trashy language interfered with the story and character development.  Shady language is okay but not the trash that was in this book.  I compare this to comedians whose language is so foul that the jokes lose their humor just like the language in this book lost its story.<br /><br />I won't be so eager next time to buy another book by Ms. Rawlings.
0679805273|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER! I LOVE THIS BOOK! THE ONLY GIFT I GIVE FOR A JOB WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I think everybody should own this one, and just go back and re-read every time you need that little push!
B00932A3SK|4.0|If you thought that action and adventure films only came from Hollywood this Norwegian offering will quickly disabuse you of that opinion. A corporate headhunter, who moonlights as a thief, gets caught up in tangle of sex, lies and violence in ways that would make Sam Peckinpaugh jealous. Yes, the fact that it is subtitled is irritating in that you often do not get the time to read the text before the scene moves on, but it will still hold your attention from beginning to end. It is that Scandinavian kink that does the trick.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, and I didn't want to put it down even though I was holidaying in Port Douglas,Queensland!<br />Cheryl is very honest, sincere and generous with her story of her relationships, heroin, places she hiked too and the people she meet along the way. I found her to be very brave from the get go. It makes me want to dust of my hiking boots, (but only to do bush walks locally!). Wishing Cheryl all the best for future novels that she hopefully writes and that I will certainly buy.<br />Michelle, VIC Australia
B008XFJEE2|4.0|Young, obsessive love.  So glad she found the strength to finally leave.  Amazing roles for both.  Rourke was hot.  Too bad he had to get old.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's an alright game just need to be a bit cheaper for characters and boards also make easier to get coins

1476712042|5.0|I purchased the paperback of this book to take on vacation, and I spent 24 hours absolutely obsessed with it! I haven't read anything so addictive since the Twilight series - Travis is gorgeous, she's damaged yet strong - love it. The sequel is just as good, if not even better. Jamie McGuire is my new favorite author!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this app i always play it when i am just looking for some good old fun relaxing time! WORTH THE MONEY!
1452101248|5.0|This cookbook is beautiful and pleasing, both in its elegance of presentation and super photography! Now for the flavours within: I made the sweet potato wedges with lemongrass creme fraiche and thought I was sinning! (which is a good thing) This is a cookbook that allows you to vamp up your vegetables! Anyone who is quasi-vegetarian will not feel deprived; there is a completeness to every recipe that is very satisfying.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use it when I'm away from home.  My Kendal is with me always and when I stay over night somewhere it is my clock to get me where I need to be on time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just started watching season 4 on tv and did not even know there were other seasons. I am truly addicted, a great show. Great for legal buffs too, I am a true Law and Order fan. You get law and Chris Noth.<br />Loving it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My son downloaded it, he and my granddaughter played while I was with them and when I got home I started playing...it is addictive.
B002R25THI|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this movie.  The great thing about older films is that the acting had to carry the film.  Present day special effects did not exist.  The actors and the cinematography would make or break a film.  Both were good here and I recommend watching this film.
B005HSL626|3.0|My son downloaded it for my 6 year old granddaughter, She is having a ball with it and I have to give her an end time with &#34;MY&#34; Kendal....

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|ONE of the most challenging and enjoyable game I have ever played.  DEFINITELY RECCOMEND.  can't hardly wait till I start on the next voyage.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|There's not really a SPOILER ALERT in this review, I just wanted to give you a heads up that I'm about to say something that may deter you from watching the movie...You ready? Here it comes: It was different, but pretty good up until the end. And, I can appreciate CGI, but only in moderation. That's all. I just know that if someone tells me a movie has a bad ending, I won't watch it.<br /><br />Well, I thought I heard that someone who contributed to Pans Labyrinth had something to do with this film, which disappointed me a little but I decided to watch it anyway. Granted, there were a couple of good jumps. I love horror films but by the time I was about 20 minutes into it, I was wishing I hadn't decided to watch it alone. My dog moaned at one point, and I peed a little.<br /><br />I think they hit \\"their\\" mark with Mama's character, but not mine. Don't get me wrong, broad was creepy as dookie! But she was also ugly as sin, even pre-grudge. Though, that perfectly depicted the realistic nature of parent/child relationships. Your mother's the most beautiful woman in the world to you. There was one point where I thought they were working too hard to make her ugly...I seriously don't understand why so feel free to explain.<br /><br />But the trying too hard part...that is why I did not like Pans Laybrinth. I felt they tried to make me feel something. Physically, I'm a woman, but emotionally, I'm a dude. There was a twinge of something, but I'm old and childless and pmsing so...<br /><br />I can't say it was a bad movie. It was full, interesting, suspenseful at times... There was just something not quite right toward the 2/3 mark, and then the ending ruined the whole damn thing. But the crappy ending doesn't stick with you very long. It's been about 10 mins since it ended and I'm over it now.<br /><br />If you're still up in the air, you should probably see it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My 11 year old girls say the movie &#34;is amazing.&#34;  They liked everything about it. They especially liked the music.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|This has always been the album that has helped me go to to sleep. She has a very soothing voice
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow is all I can say! This was a great mind melter for me lol. It made my day by pretty fast. Great distraction for me while I stayed in. Can't wait for more games like this.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great movie to keep you wondering what is going to happen next and never figuring that out until the next episode.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|This book contains short narratives of the qualities of a Warrior of the Light- in other words, all of us who seek to be our most authentic selves.  I reach for it when I need a moment of wisdom, insight, instruction.  It is an mportant addition to any bookshelf that reflects a reader's spiritual quest.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time Killer, by Todd M. Thiede, is a crime thriller follows detective Max Larkin and his rookie partner Jesse Fairlane.  The story takes place in the quiet city of Rockton, Illinois where Max and Jesse are working on a case of a murdered family.  Their killer is known to always wear a mask and business suit, while leaving the scene with victims missing fingers and messages written in blood!  Though Max likes to work alone, you really get to see his character grow as he learns to work with Jesse.  Not only does she learn from Max, as the the experienced detective, but she also teaches him to rely on others too.<br /><br />  The author does a great job at telling this story.  It is a thriller through and through.  It had my attention from the very start, making me really want to turn the page to find out what was going to happen next.  Many times I found myself saying just a few more pages, or just until I find out what's going to happen.  It was very easy to get through fairly quickly.  I would definitely recommend this book to those who love a good thriller that will keep them on the edge of their seat!  I look forward to reading more by this author!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I didn't see the movie and didn't know the story when this book arrived.  That was the very best way to read it.  Not only did I follow the transformation of Pi, but I experienced my own transformation.  I discovered that there are many layers of courage and I came to cherish our resiliency.  It isn't particularly poetically written, but it burrows deeply into the reader's heart.
1476733953|5.0|I had read all of the positive reviews on this book prior to getting it, but I have to admit, I am always a bit leery of post-apocalyptic novels - they really can go either way, and it tends to be the wrong way.  Wool, however, was absolutely amazing.  I was pulled into the story immediately, and it never let me go.  I absolutely could not put it down.  It was extremely well written, engaging, and provided a very interesting perspective on basic human psychology.  I loved it!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I enjoyed the constant use of comparisons of Art and Life.  You really have to stay with it at all times.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Definitely worth a go if you like games like this. Reminds me of games like Dungeon quest. A good old fashioned hack and slash!
0060751967|4.0|When I first read the title of this story I thought the book wasn't going to be very good but after reading it I can honestly say that my first thought was wrong. This book is awesome and it has a very creative world that I think many people are going to adore. I know I do. It's a world you will get trapped in...
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I got this for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 in order to download and view online college classes.  It is great: easy to use, fast, and simple controls.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like this app, but not as much as I thought I would.  Like a diary or journal, but better to me.  It helped me keep on target.

B00AOCZOLO|1.0|This will be good for the first and second seasons. The show stars Zooey(yay?) and her ragtag band of misfit new roommates. three men who are all around age 30 and single. oh boy the fun they must have. while this is unoriginal that is not the problem. the problem is Zooey aka Jess as shes called in the show is probably the least interesting of all the characters on the entire show. she is seriously the worst choice to lead. in fact if this was real life and Jess was a real character left on her own she would be dead inside of a week.<br /><br />here are some things the all so loveable adorkable Jess does<br /><br />-falls down and trips without bumping into anything which is revealed to apparently be a regular thing.<br />-she calls someone over a video on youtube and asks this mysterious other person how she can get something taken off the internet.<br />-selfishly causes all of her friends and roommates to lose their place in line on black friday in the best buy line so she can have fun with her new BF who is late who she dumps an episode or two later.<br />-she also selfishly ruins her roommates thanksgiving of football.<br />-given her dress attire she inexplicably cannot wear heels and walk in them.<br />-gets fired....fails to find a job in time and then wonders why the gas bill is cut off.<br />-cries during a job interview...goes back to the same place the next day and gets the job anyway.<br />-both christmas episodes are horrible<br />-two people that are divorced are fighting so she just starts singing which is referenced as something she once did before as a child while her parents fought proving she is a 20 something stuck with the brain of a five year old.<br />-causes her roommate and best friend of the bunch of roommates(not her BFF just her BFF of the roommates) to miss his flight because she is sad so the only thing to do is naturally cheer her up(the world revolves around her in this show i think she could command the sun and stars is she had a brain enough to figure it out) which involves missing his flight and going to see the christmas lights which are not turned on so the group decides to yell obnoxiously in the middle of the night to get everyone to turn them on. a more logical solution would be to have these braindead idiots arrested.<br /><br />the point is the entire show revolves around Jess who is nothing more than a 5 year old. she randomly breaks into singing, crying, breaks up with people because she is a fickle female dog(all the female characters on the show are really), she parent traps her parents who are divorced like a 5 year old including the references to when she was 5, has no ability to throw together an outfit of clothes that doesnt come off as just strange(highlighted by her inability to pick out clothes to wear on dates so she naturally picks overalls despite she has plenty of dresses), if she was left to live alone would die within a week, is constantly upbeat and happy and cheery for no reason at all and just does the most illogical things ever, and oh so much more. thats Jess. the most annoying of the characters on the show and sadly the star of the show.<br /><br />the rest of the cast however really does well.....Nick becomes a fantastic character that you really see is struggling as a 30 year old that just cannot get his crap together. Schmidt has his stuff together but he cannot seal the deal in a relationship. Winston im not really sure what he does beyond being Nicks fail buddy and cracking random remarks. i guess the show needs a black guy. CeCe is Jess's BFF female friend but she too acts like a female dog although ironically despite being a model she is far smarter than Jess who is a teacher could ever be which is even more ironic.<br /><br />the reason these characters dont get more of a write up is because the show singularly revolves around Jess. the new girl universe could be called the Jess universe. when the other characters take center stage for at most 30 seconds it is usually interrupted by Jess or in some cases when Schmidt and CeCe have a romance together half of that is taken up by how do we hide this from Jess which is the only time that romance or any set of characters is allowed to have more than 30 seconds of non-Jess TV time. so really their character growth is solely based on Jess. its quite sad really because the rest of the cast is filled with funny moments and great chemistry together until Jess enters the screen. it isnt even a week that she is there in her new place where her male roommates bend over backwards to help her because she is there friend so they basically sacrifice an entire night of fun they had been planning for months to go be with the socially stupid and completely idiotic ditzy braindead woman friend roommate person named Jess.<br /><br />that said i hate myself for having watched most of this show. i dont know why i did but i did. but it really is terrible. anytime the other characters get screen time without Jess i enjoy it for those brief 30 second bursts. then Jess enters....then i cry wondering what i am doing to myself because without fail she will start singing or moving or hands in some weird way or just start babbling on and on in some incoherent manner about something. i wonder how she is a teacher but then again ive had more than one incoherent teacher that just babbled on endlessly about nothing and made up stuff as they went along.<br /><br />the show also resets every episode or every few episodes. by the end of season 1 the show was looking for make forward progression but just simply reset all of that. Jess was in a solid relationship but ended it just because? Nick was finally going to move out but just ended it because? CeCe breaks up with Schmidt for really no reason at all. everyone was going forward with a lot of momentum and then it all ends and is reset. so season 2 starts with this reset and has had 0 progress so far(yes i havent seen the grand finale or last few episodes yet) but if its like season 1 this will all be undone in a matter of time. its TV logic. you cant pair people together and not break them up its not \\"interesting\\" but i find that annoying yet thats why its done. let characters pair up. let them move forward. but im sure without fail it will all be undone and i am sure this show will never stop being the Jess universe. really if she was just a side character it would be great because it can be hilarious otherwise. sure 20 minute sitcoms dont have great character development and tend to reset things but even most sitcoms at least have forward momentum or continuity. Seinfeld had plots that spanned episodes and seasons. Cosby show did, Roseanne did, married with children did, even the big bang theory has had plots progress through seasons. new girl does not as it constantly resets.<br /><br />there are only two plots that mildly continue from episode 1 onwards....CeCe and Schmidt kind of and Jess and Nick again kind of. its mild and barely there at times and its very poorly kept together. the show also does reference things that happened in previous episodes a lot so it does carry over the problem is character relationships/friendships reset back to ground 0. character jobs go back to ground 0. character growth and learning go back to ground 0.<br /><br />seriously stay away people.
1401322786|5.0|This book is really amazing. It is a light, easy read with a powerful message. I haven't read one of Mitch Albom's books before, but after reading &#34;The Time Keeper,&#34; I think that I'll look into more of his books.<br /><br />In case you haven't read the synopsis, this is the story of Father Time and his journey to discover the preciousness of time itself. Along with a young teenage girl and a man in his late seventies, they help not only Father Time, but themselves on their paths to better understanding themselves and the people around them.

B00COHAUD4|3.0|I am not a fan of supernatural, scary movies but &#34;Mama&#34; was riveting and the premise was interesting to say the least.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|What's not to like about the Bible it has reading plan, bookmarks and you can share verses with a friend. The only con is you have to have internet connectivity and I have another Bible loaded on my Kindle that I can read anytime I want with or without the internet that is the only reason for the 4 rating.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I buy it and all I get for my money is some stupid error message I think the problem is only for original kindles so I you own one and are thinking of downlaoding this app I recommend you don't
B000068OCS|5.0|Unusual, but I could watch it over & over again.  The visual is just part of the draw: Phillip Glass' music keeps the viewer enthralled.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone that isn't addicted to todays mundane & idiotic products of Hollywood.  And, maybe if the addict watches this, perhaps they'll realize that they're living Koyaanisqatsi, & kick the habit.
B008602KQI|3.0|I never really got over the premise.  Who cares about a society like that?  This story could have been several times as compelling had the districts randomly selected criminals.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|She is funny this book is not. End of  the story. Please don't contribute to making the publishers of this book rich.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|The acting is top-notch, and the effects are movie quality.  I wasn't motivated to watch episode after episode, but I'm sure that many may feel that way.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Die hard fall out boy fan for years, and this is definitely up there with my favorite albums. Not as good as from under the cork tree, but better than foile a deux

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|We love this game. It's very fun. It doesn't take a lot of money to play either. We have a lot of fun playing this game. We would recommend downloading this app.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I watched the first two seasons on HBO before I started reading the book, and was pleased at how well the TV series matched the first book. The books provide much more insight behind the characters, which I enjoy. By reading the books, I understand the characters and the story much better.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is excellent, the first time I heard it I listened to it on repeat for about a week.
0345803485|2.0|But I had to find out for myself, didn't I? Pointless to keep talking, but talk I must, or rather write, for you insist upon it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I found this movie beautiful and moving.  Helen Hunt is extraordinary.  Her performance must have been challenging, but looks effortless.  I didn't recognize John Hawkes from his other films (see his Wikipedia entry, many supporting roles).  He's also wonderful, bringing great humanity to the lead role.  The supporting cast is solid and spot-on.  It's a courageous movie filled with love and humanity, truly recommended.
B006M4F67A|5.0|My friend plays mahjong and often remarks how fun it is.  It was easy to learn and fun to play.  I'm hooked.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very fun game and lots of great challenges. Can't wait for the second one. Hoping the sequel is as fun and challenging as this one was. LOVE the hidden object games by Big Fish.
B005KELW26|5.0|The product was excellent in fit and quality.  I couldn't ask for a better deal or product. The magnet lock is a thing of beauty.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|This book was a very good read, but I thought it ended abruptly.  And it felt like it fizzled a bit towards the end.  I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Good read full of twists and turns can't wait to move onto the next book. Highly recommend killing floor by lee child.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|4 years, almost to the date, any concerns fans had over Paramount Studio's decision to reboot the initial Star Trek `Enterprise & Crew' were, within the first 30 minutes dispelled, and a new generation and legions of new fans embraced the concept of `new faces' to the `old characters'.<br /><br />All associated with this project are due credit for successfully rebooting and breathing new life into a tired franchise. The real credit resides with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci who's homage to the initial Star Trek, highlighted by the presence of Lenoard Memoy, complete with a clever alternate time line and universe, allowed J.J. Abrams' the opportunity to mine the history of the Star Trek universe, and unfettered by the history and short comings of the previous movies, allowed the same characters to be developed in a different arc.<br /><br />With the same crew in-front of and behind the camera from the first outing, Star Trek into Darkness with a longer running time, affords greater character development and screen time to each member of the Enterprise. In the process each actor elevates the status and depth of their characters and in the process finally lay to rest, the ghost of, and, any comparisons to the initial cast and crew.<br /><br />The show here belongs to, and is focused on the central relationship between Chris Pine's Kirk and Zachary Quinto's Spock, their emerging friendship, and the impact and cost this relationship will have on each character and each other.<br /><br />Credit once again must go to Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof who's story and script anchors this film with the characters and their relationship, and do not allow the spectacular, non-stop action, and dynamic set pieces to overshadow the real story, which is one of relationships, and the cost and price friendship can demand. This is no simple achievement, but is the basis on which this film will be categorised as either good, great, or, brilliant.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams continuing foray into this genre, is nothing short of spectacular! His ability to not only maintain, but improve on his re-booting of Star Trek is a phenomenal achievement, and testament to his skill as a visionary story teller and action director, which are the real reasons that Disney and George Lucas went out of their way to secure his Directorial Services for the forthcoming Star Wars IIV.<br /><br />The barometer for Star Trek into Darkness should not be measured against Star Trek, but against the recently released Iron Man 3 which appears to be the movie that all 2013 releases will be gauged. In this face-off, Star Trek into Darkness casts the longer shadow, and on all aspects of movie making, can be counted as the best movie thus far in 2013.<br /><br />Prior to concluding, particular mention must go to the `Supporting Cast', especially Bruce Greenwood, in a limited but career best performance, ably supported by Peter Weller However, the real star of Star Trek is Benedict Cumberbatch, who's screen presence is 3D even in 2D. Every frame, each perfectly enunciated syllable and facial nuance is one of pure intensity, malevolence and distain that would send a shiver down the spine of Hannibal Lecter (even on a second viewing). This follows on from his excellent and measured performance in Cloud Atlas, his spectacular ownership of Sherlock Holmes, and the as yet unknown performance in The Hobbit Trilogy!<br /><br />In conclusion, STAR TREK into DARKNESS is a spectacular movie, a rare achievement, matched only by the calibre of talent in front of, and behind the lens, and is an indictment of a director with a limited number of peers. This is a movie that can be deemed a companion and equal to movies such as The Dark Knight Rises, Blade Runner, The Lives of Others, Alien, Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />9.5 out of 10
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Selecting this video as my choice to watch was sorta like going on a blind date. I didn't imagine this video would provide me with such delightful entertainment. Jennifer Lawrence is a beautiful talented actress that I would like to see more often.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Thought this was going to be sleeping with the enemy revamp but it wasn't.  The ending has a very touching twist.  Worth watching!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|While I did not enjoy this one quite as much as the others in the series, its still a good book and worth a read to fans of the series.
B000O14VAU|4.0|Entertaining take on the vampire mythology.  The movie is more of an action/adventure as opposed to horror, but it does have it's fair share of blood and gore.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|What would a world be like without love ? Really interesting storyline. Hard to put down. I couldn't wait for the next book !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use and lots and lots of versions to choose from!!!  AWESOME!  Reading Plans are AWESOME too...a  must have!
B0049VZ222|5.0|One of the doctors I work with in the ER bought me the first episode on his Amazon at work because he said I will be addicted instantly. He was right. I see what all the hype was about.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, excellent graphics, infallible touch screen response.  If you enjoy puzzle games, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one than this.  This game will make a person think.  Sort of reminds me of MYST....Without the endless tromping and trudging around an island/world.  Definitely worth the cost.  I found myself thinking of solutions when I wasn't playing the game, and going back to see if I got it right.  Waiting for the next ROOM.
B001R0LOES|5.0|This tells fairly accurately the story of Michael Collins, the greatest name in the creation of Ireland. Liam Neeson seems to capture the spirit of the man, though Neeson really is too tall to play the man. With this very minor criticism, this is the best movie the to see if one wants to understand the struggles Irish people went through to wrest their country from the English.
B008XG1X18|4.0|What can really be said about this app? If you're on Pinterest and want to have it on the go this is great.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is such an amazing book. I am reading this for my book club at school and I wish we can re-read the book.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|This version of Persuasion doesn't compare favorably to the 1971 BBC version that starred Ann Firbank. I suppose that trying to compress a five hour story into one and 3/4 hours didn't help matters. I will say that Amanda Root was a better Anne Elliot than Ann Firbank.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|could. not get it in my cloud could not find it in my apps it fir not work then thay make you pay!
B00140PK6O|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;Cranford&#34;  and am looking forward to &#34;Return to Cranford when it arrives. The cast is full of superb actors and like another Elizabeth Gaskell story, &#34;Wives and Daughters&#34;, not a bad actor in the bunch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing! For all horse- or animal- lovers i would highly recommend it. The graphics are phenomenal, and the things your can do, the possibilities are endless! And the way that they give you gems every once in a while, is very awesome too. Amazing app in all. :)
B009MYAQK4|4.0|Like most of Paulo Coelho's books I found pieces of it to be inspirational and while not every page was a riveting read the sum of the nuggets of wisdom adds up to a successful book in my mind.
B004LUS390|5.0|Okay, so I'm in high school at the moment. I can't really lug around my PC with me everywhere I go, and my lap top is slower than a small. Both have this program installed on it, but I usually use them to touch up my traditional drawings and add watermarks. It's been a pretty program, but until now I've always preferred traditional methods.<br /><br />Having this app has gotten me more into digital art. I'm a heavy Copic user, so having all those colors available to me on my Kindle is fantastic. I've doodled some stuff here and there, and created some fantastic art as well. This app is pretty nice, even if I use a finger sometimes. Excellent when used with a stylus, I may add. Easily one of my top 5 most used apps on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I downloaded the game when it was the FAOTD and have been playing it for several days now and finally played through to the end.  It is a fun puzzle game that challenges you to accomplish certain tasks in specific order to be able to add to your castle and get the most out of the game play. I personally did not play the next level until I could finish the objectives before \\"nightfall\\" which made it interesting as a strategy game to try different tasks or build buildings in a new order each time. You can also finish the game before the timer runs out past nightfall but you do not build upon your castle. You can, however, go back to the unfinished level at any time on the map to fully complete if you wish.<br /><br />I felt there were enough levels and difficulty to challenge me with this game and make it enjoyable and well worth the download. I wasn't harassed with rating throughout play or a need to do in-app purchasing in order to advance within the game which was a bonus as well. Graphics were nice and there was a lot to process in this game but I think was also its downfall as it was a HUGE suckage of phone battery life; even while plugged in and charging (thus the minus one star.)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IN A WHILE. Well worth money spent on GAME. Makes you think and work to get the answers to solve the puzzles. Just wish there was more! So sad when it ended. I will be playing this again. Loved it. Enough said!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a remarkable tale of historical fiction, beautifully written with memorable characters, characters which made me laugh aloud and weep in empathy. McKenna style is fresh and true to the nature of the novel. I will gladly recommend The Misremembered Man to anyone interested in a good read.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I enjoyed this book, and the scenery was lovely. I will recommend this old classic book to my younger sister who enjoys classic books
1883217040|5.0|Someone in a previous review commented about the value he derived in understanding the role of the minor sixth scale as the foundation for jazz voicings(though I'm paraphrasing what was written).  This was exactly my experience with this book.  I also liked the coverage of voicings I wasn't familiar with, the illustrations of them and especially the three arrangements of the tune \\"Spring is Here\\" which appears near the end of the book.  The last by Kenny Barron is an amazing rendition with the use of the G pedal tone to create a very unusual sounding modal arrangement of it.<br /><br />I read it about three times and have recommended to countless customers whose pianos I've serviced.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Interesting portrayal of an individual who seems to be a great pilot with a serious problem. Having traveled a lot in my career, I do recall sharing the hotel lounge with many airline personnel.<br />Amazing turnaround at the end.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|As first look this may seem to be a depressing subject but it TOTALLY is not a depressing movie! I would very much recommend it to adult friends & family.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|An accurate portrayal of what happened.  The inner workings of both CIA and citizens who dont mind getting involved.  Something that does not happen in todays world.
B007SGM084|4.0|Could not put it down..............  CAN'T wait for the next book to get my attention like this.  What a nice love ...
B009AMANBA|5.0|Very political.  If you like politics and negotiation you will enjoy this one.  Provides for some personal interface with the man and his character.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will remember reading this for the rest of my life.  Such an amazing saga of life and death and hope.  The characterization was off the charts good - so real they become a part of you and you fear for their futures, care about their past, and can't wait to see what happens on the next page.  Highly recommended.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Gives one something to think about when it comes to being stranded.  Who or what would you rather be stranded with.<br />Great plot and imagination.
0316069884|5.0|This is a very disturbing book. It deals with the inhumane way animals are treated before they are slaughtered. The author does not say that we must all go vegan. However he makes a very strong case for treating them kindly in their lives. I grew up as a vegan. However later in life, I did start eating meat. After reading this book, decided to go vegan again....not for religious reasons, rather for the humane argument against the killing of animals. One thing about the human conscience...it is easy to  overlook. This book makes one think and question our morals.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Not done reading it yet but I think I have the plot figured out.  I have read quite a few John Grisham's books so I know his style.  A good read to just relax on the porch swing and read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am almost exclusively a suspense book reader.  This book was suggested by a co-worker.  I cannot put this book down!  I just started the 3rd book.  Amazon had a great deal on the Trilogy books for a low price.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great game, a must play. I would recommend this game to anyone, nice looking game and good controls must try
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one of the best games if u love farming and going going to barns likeninand riding horses u should decently beg this game love it
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked the different approach and the fact that the hero's background was one of difficulty.  The outcome was not obvious, to me anyway.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful mix of history, geography, and melodrama.  As in past books, Follett creates insufferable villains and and then punishes them, while the good guys and gals ultimately triumph.  He can be criticized for going a bit too far with this theme but it's not a big deal
B0027MJU00|1.0|Hated this book.  It made me sick to my stomach sometimes literally!!  I will never read another book by this author!!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I usually don't write movie reviews.  I watch them for entertainment - period.<br /><br />If you love the true American hero.  Watch this movie.<br /><br />End.<br /><br />LOVE IT!  Kudos,and hope to see more!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I love this author and will read all her books.  This is a well written book and I enjoyed every page of it.
030014332X|3.0|i read a review that praised it as being great for children.  i bought it for my grand daughters.  they had zero interest.  i don't know if the fault lies with them or the reviewer.
B001974DG0|5.0|His best book in my opinion.If you're a dog lover,you'll love this book.Einstein,the Golden Retriever with an intelligence rivaling that of humans,is a great hero.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|The rating was bit low for this, all-too-realistic movie.<br />It was a well told story otherwise. The director did a good job of making the viewer feel the ambiguity of catastrophe and drowning.<br />A little too in love with blood spilling though.<br />Hard to watch.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Not the best but definitely a good on the go sharpener, works fine with most of my knives. Just have to be careful using this with bigger blades knives.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I got this as a free app of the day. Yesterday Amazon App Store went nuts. It told me to reinstall the game. I did. Since then only 6 of the 12 restaurants are unlocked. Now the game wants money to play levels I've already played. I don't know why this is going on but, if it gets fixed, I'll fix my rating. Otherwise, the game is dead to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am very happy that Mojang lowered the price. I even got to pay with Amazon points! This app is one of my faves, so I seriously definitely recommend this app!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 9 year old has spent hours building things and is beginning to gain more spacial awareness from designing the houses, rooms etc.  I'm not sure how closely the game mirrors the version my oldest plays online, but for my 9 year old, it suits her just fine.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Well done, well thought out, superb characters and plot!  We don't get regular tv/cable/satellite, we use Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus and Netflix for our 'tv' watching which is great because then you can watch several episodes at a time.  Can't wait for next season!
0451450523|5.0|I loved the movie when I was a kid so I bought the book for my daughter... and then had to read it myself. Peter S Beagle continues to be in my opinion one of the greatest storytellers EVER. His tales will make you feel as if you're sitting around a fire and being told age old legends.... If you enjoy this I highly recommend Giant Bones (a book of short stories.)
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The Short: Featuring a strong and incredibly dynamic cast that is both well acted and written, a grandeur of delicious special effects and an incredible sense of pacing to match the first, JJ Abrams returns with \\"Into Darkness\\" only to (nearly) out-do himself.<br /><br />9.25/10<br /><br />Ah, the summer movie season. The time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists, loud and booming explosions, and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix. It's a summer movie clich&eacute;; one that is fun, yet unfulfilling. You could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of 2009's best films, Star Trek, but have no fear...JJ Abrams is back in action.<br /><br />Into Darkness has come early in the summer movie season, but I'm sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also Trek fans. For me, it's definitely going to be one of the 2013 summer blockbusters to judge all others, simply because it does nearly everything right.<br /><br />Returning with a phenomenal cast, Into Darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time, which succeeds in almost every way. The whole cast, from Kirk to Spock (Pine and Quinto), Scotty to Chekov (Pegg and Yelchin), I could go on and on...the whole cast rocks. Dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here, with each and every character having their shining \\"moment.\\" Cumberbatch, our villain this time around, is also fantastic, featuring an intense and believable performance that doesn't feel clich&eacute; or silly. Above all else one of my favorites, Scotty, gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene. It's only some of the newer faces on the Enterprise are simply \\"there\\", but it's cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight. The character driven story could've fallen apart, but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes you'll want to root for.<br /><br />The story of Into Darkness is nothing \\"new\\", but it's far from boring and dull. Featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces, the story told is one that could've easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting. While the plot of the original is a little \\"thrown in there\\", the plot here is more essential to the experience, it's just a little less original. There are a couple of plot holes, mainly when getting closer to the ending, but it doesn't distract...it simply (and sadly) mars an incredible experience.<br /><br />The visual effects wizards that Abrams commands are also back, with some incredibly delicious results. Ships look gorgeous, phasers and guns look vibrant and cool, and the action sequences are FANTASTIC. Abrams trademark style shines here too, with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that it's impossible not to be glued to your seat. There are also some simply gorgeous shots, from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most CGI enhanced scenes.<br /><br />The soundtrack (composed by the wonderful Michael Giacchino) is perfect. The theme is incredible, Khan's theme is excellent, and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping. The sound effects are loud and in your face, but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment. It's edited to perfection (in theaters).<br /><br />It's only a couple of plot holes and the lack of \\"freshness\\" that made the original so incredible that keeps Into Darkness just shy of greatness. It's the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair, which arguably is more important and thus makes Into Darkness the superior entry in the series.<br /><br />As for now, Into Darkness is a truly spectacular 2nd act for the Enterprise and crew, one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and Abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory.<br /><br />But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.<br /><br />9.25/10n. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory.<br /><br />But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.<br /><br />9.25/10
B008602KQI|4.0|My favorite about this movie was watching the scenes and costumes worn in this movie.  I find it very creative.  I've never read the book so I have nothing to compare it by.  But, it's a decent PG-13 show and I think the acting was good.
B004J09ONG|5.0|As a child I loved the movie Born Free, then as an adult it was just too sad in many respects. I have small children and they see things so differently. We watched the movie together and I was able to see it again through a child's eyes. I decided to read the book and am about half way through it now, loving every page (Kindle page that is). There is so much more detail than in the film (as usual). Very well written. I have George Adamson's (Joy's husband) autobiography &#34;My Pride and Joy&#34; on order and cannot wait to read it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This has to be one of the better free games out there.  I had it on my droid, but it is even better on my kindle.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It is a great read for teenagers full of suspense and drama I totally recommend this book to middle schoolers and high schoolers
B008M4OYYY|5.0|Fantastic build. Loads of fun and capable at any difficulty level. One of my favorites to put together. Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Addicting, but complicated game.  Also can get pricy to advance in game, unless you want to bug your friends to help/join
B004J4WLPU|5.0|A real page turner...<br />A great story...<br />Much to learn...<br />Twists and turns to marvel at...<br />Kudos to Rosamund Lupton for engaging her readers .
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really wasn't happy with the standard keyboard that came with my galaxy note 2 so I decided to give SwiftKey a try. It's great! I'm really impressed with how accurately it predicts the words at the top. Sometimes I only have to press the first letter of a sentence and all the rest of the words are up there. I highly recommend this app!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Thought I'd try this just to see what it was like.  Now I find it hard to put down.  Just a fun app to play!  Enjoy!!
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book mostly due to he charismatic and quirky storytelling of Dr. Feynman. A very charming story, indeed. However, as an aspiring scientist, I appreciate his outlook on maintaining a certain quality of scientific inquiry and enthusiasm for such learning and exploring. His lifelong pleasure in solving and discovering is quite inspiring! Other students of science or those who appreciate the many wonders of life are sure to be enthrall end by this book.
6305363668|4.0|The Directors cut was not as great an improvement over the shorter version.<br />It is still a very good story and movie and would recommenf to any sci-fi fan.

B00122ORBI|5.0|The recoding is very good for a MP3 file.<br />Vangelis fans need to add this to their collection.<br />I purchased El Greco...MP3 format
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love this amazing artist! His music just makes you want to dance and sing along, and I do! Very talented.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I have read all but a few of the Shopaholic books from Sophie Kinsella. I personally love her books and the goofy sense of humor. This new book is just the same and won't disappoint you. It may not be AS funny as some of her other titles but it certainly isn't as bad as some of these reviews make it out to be. We all have different tastes and I do agree some of Sophie's books made me laugh more than this one, but that certainly doesn't make this a bad book. It did make me laugh and while it hasn't replaced Twenties Girl or Can You Keep A Secret as my Kinsella favorites, it was still fun and enjoyable....I say support Sophie, buy her new book and I can't wait to see what she puts out next!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I like a few of the songs. This is actually the first Timberlake CD I have ever purchased. He is very talented.
B000VAFCOS|4.0|Really good score.  Worth a buy, but wouldn't listen to it as a complete album.  More for film score lovers.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I am very happy with all my Bruno Mars music purchases. Good songs, make you wanna dance. All my friends loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun. The police that is chasing you makes you want to do your best and have a good time. The prizes are cool, but I wish there were more during the game. The prizes that you buy are to expensive to me. So I hope you change those things. Thank You!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have much of Josh Groban's music. I love all kinds of music and this is one artist who's music I always buy!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I love music, although I don't listen to my music near as much as I use to when I was younger. But the app seems to work good for me when I do listen.
1451695195|1.0|If you would like to read this book, DON'T BUY IT - please save your money and check it out from your local library.  I did and gladly so.  The book leads you to think God will be mentioned but that is NOT the case.  Rather the author uses \\"Om\\" and other oddities.  A good book is \\"Heaven is for real\\".
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great series that gets better with each show.  Excellent acting and contemporary subject matter.  I really enjoy watching it and recommend it.
B00969GFFU|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Franzen amazed me a few years ago when I read The Corrections, so I had very, very high expectations for Freedom, and it did not disappoint. Through his handful of main characters and the ancillary ones with whom they occasionally interact, he explores such varied facets of Americana, capitalism, and their effects on the world, it boggles the mind. While some of the activities in which his characters partake are somewhat fantastic, the characters themselves are so real, it's scary. Franzen takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of emotions, everything from depression to anger to fear to laughter to awe . . . I couldn't possibly name them all.<br /><br />His ability to weave humor into a story involving so much negativity - macro and micro environmental effects of capitalism's demand for never ending growth, impending doom of the human race through overpopulation, exploitation of the US taxpayer by his and her government during the Iraq War and the deaths it caused, lying and cheating in American marriage, untimely death . . . the list goes on - is remarkable. One of my favorite sequences comes from the first part of Patty's autobiography (a two part subsection of the book) and it made me laugh out loud, I just have to quote it here (note that Patty is married to Walter, Joey is their son, and Richard, a musician, is Walter's best friend):<br /><br />\\". . . the only thing that could have thrown Walter back into the bad ways he'd felt in college . . . would have been some bizarre pathological sequence of events. . . . Walter would have had to have terrible conflicts with Joey, and fail to understand him and earn his respect, and generally find himself replicating his relationship with his own dad, and Richard's career would have had to take an unexpected latter-day turn for the better, and Patty would have had to fall violently in love with Richard. What were the chances of that happening?<br /><br />Alas, not zero.\\" (page 139 - 140)<br /><br />There's a page break between \\"happening?\\" and \\"Alas\\" that makes these lines just absolutely perfect. This occurs about a quarter of the way into the novel and right here Franzen tells us that the relationships among the main characters are going to take some crazy turns. This revelation not only made me laugh, as I've already mentioned, but also made me extremely curious about how it would all happen. The fact that the author can essentially tell his readers what will happen and, at least in my case, draw them in further, and manage to give them a big laugh at the same time, it's just incredible to me, I'm in awe.<br /><br />The only reason I've given this book four stars instead of five is the treatment of Lalitha, Walter's intern with whom he falls in love. To me, her sudden death seemed like, dare I write, a bit of a cop out from Franzen. It's almost as if he knew he wanted to get Walter back together with Patty in the end, couldn't do so if Walter and Lalitha's relationship continued to blossom, so he killed her off in a car accident without much explanation, launching Walter into a lonely life of hermitry before Patty forced herself back into his arms. I don't know . . . seems to me Franzen could've chosen many paths through which Lalitha could've left Walter, having succeeded in receiving the love of the older man she wanted so badly, she could've left him almost as easily as a car could've crashed into hers late at night. Perhaps for Lalitha to leave Walter, the way Franzen writes, he just didn't want to make an already long book a lot longer. I don't know that he could've made Walter leaving Lalitha a believable alternative, so I do applaud him for not going that route.<br /><br />Richard Katz, the Richard mentioned above, was my favorite character. With him, Franzen perfectly captures the artist who wants to make his/her living as an artist but despises the thought of his/her music becoming mainstream. Katz goes so far as to return to carpentry work after his first taste of commercial success. It's fun how Katz's efforts at thwarting his commercial success, in some ways add to it. Reminds me of when The Corrections became an Oprah favorite, Franzen was quoted stating that he doesn't write his books for Oprah's following and doesn't care whether they read his books (something like that), and sales of the book proceeded to explode. Anyhow, I'm not doing the complexity of Katz's character justice with this brief mention, but this review is getting to be too long, so I'll move on from Katz just by stating that his sections of the book were my favorites.rst taste of commercial success.

B00CFNUMD0|4.0|Terrific work and just love the players as the owner is so spicy but the sheep are so smart. Thanks!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is a testament worth adding to your personal reference library. I read and re read certain chapters to assist me thru my day to remain positive and calm in the site of trouble and negativism. I believe God uses me daily in his ministry, because I can automatically notice when a customer has some issues in their lives and can use a positive outlook.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE, I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY FOR EVERYONE WHO READS!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am thrilled with this series and disappointed to see that it is not ongoing. Julianna Margulies does an amazing job in this role and I have become addicted to the shows many interesting and secretive characters.
B009ANP48G|1.0|Have gotten it twice now because I thought the first copy was broken but once you get through the previews and select either play in 3D or play in 2D the screen goes black and it refuses to do anything else till you turn it off and back on again. Tried multiple times. Haven't tried on a regular DVD player though.
B005LAIII0|4.0|After all the Academy Award hype, I wanted to see this film.  Parts of it were visually beautiful - even stunning.  I could not understand part of the dialogue, due to the Indian accents of some of the actors.  At times, I thought the plot dragged on abominably (but I was sick at the time and not very patient).  The ending was confusing and didn't seem to resolve anything.<br /><br />But I loved the line \\"The story is now yours.\\" Maybe I would do better to read the novel and discuss this with a book group.  It seems like there had to be more to it that I was not able to wrap my head around.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoy this series, and I'm not even a history nut. The characters are well rounded and quite creative.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Please read this book. I picked it up knowing nothing about book or author. It reaches a deeply personal human place inside. While not a difficult read, the weight and heart of it reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird. Well done! For everyone, especially if you are tired of formulaic fiction. The Art of Racing in the Rain is an original!
B00CKKG0JS|1.0|I watched about 2 minutes of this horrible thing and turned it off.  i do not feel that I should be charged for it and want a reimbursement.  JN

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Simly classic games, remastered in high definition. And this a new expirience. Buy it, if you missed these games on PS2.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a very fun game.  It gives people a chance to \\"play\\" with horses when they don't even have a horse!!!!!!  But I wish we could customize our own horse, like what gender and color.  Also I wish we could breed the horse.Last but not least I would like if the can be in a barn.  :)  :)  :)
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|This is one of the rare comedies that are consistently laugh out loud funny all of the time. While being funny it is also a great commentary on the best and worst of family life and also sensitive at the same time.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Got this for my dad. Hes 72 , and loves Columbo. He watches the disks all the time. I call him and sometimes hes even watching when i call. If you like Columbo. This is for you.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I liked that I can defeat the crimson dynamo and unlock new armour. I thought it was more difficult to steer using the kindle itself. But overall I liked the game.
B003MC5N28|1.0|So bad it  doesn't deserve a rating, my ap teacher read this to us but he just make us read and read
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|The concept is very challenging and it is fun to try and figure out a working strategy. Specially against three AI players.  Selecting your playing pc is a bit cumbersome and it would be a huge plus if there was a smaller legend below the pcs that showed you all your pcs remaining for a quicker reference. That owuld make it much simpler to choose the pc you want.<br /><br />I would expect to be able to see the opponents pcs as well since if you are playing live players, you would see their pcs. This would have a big impact on making the correct strategic moves.<br /><br />Hopefully a more refined version is on the horizon.
B008J05EL8|1.0|can't open this app, every time a buy an app on Amazon app store it don't work. For now on I'm using free apps or just getting rid of this kindle, I'm really unhappy with Amazon right now
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|Deleted it after trying it for a few minutes.  Maybe you would have better luck with it.  Not for me.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Addictive and great fun, full of surprises never know what is going to hatch from the Dragon egg and lovely seeing your dragons evolve, shame we can't get the dawn tree, crafting etc on the Kindle fire never mind still great game x well done team lava
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My son and I love this and all angry birds programs.  Fantasic programs.  Hours of fun.  Addicting.  A must have.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This was an ok story, but, was looking for more in some of the characters. This was very well written though.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|I thought the previews looked pretty interesting. The media didn't hype it much and it seemed to come and go without a lot of mention. I watched it with low expectations and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a very interesting premise and it's acted well and filmed well. I stayed interested from start to end.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Still in the process of reading, not quite half way yet.  Very good reading. Good plot.  Going back and forth in time keeps it interesting.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game was an accidental hit for me. Not quite sure why I selected it at Amazon but it was a very, very pleasant surprise. The combination of the convincing character development, war games and a surprise ending made it one of my new favorites. Seeing the trailer of the upcoming movie, it looks like only the action will be filmed. It's also a pity that you cannot remember your own visualisation of a book anymore after seeing a movie version. Lord of the Rings was my youth favorite but now I can only visualize the movie characters. Do you yourself a pleasure and read this excellent book before you're going to watch it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It never disappoints to amaze me. I fall in love every time I watch this series. Definitely a must watch.
