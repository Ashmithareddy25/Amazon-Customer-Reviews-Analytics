B005HV6Y5W|3.0|With Mixed Results.<br /><br />***This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />Finally finding the leisure time and inclination, I watched \\"The Tree of Life\\" (hereafter ToL) on HBO on Sunday, July 8, 2012 at 9:40 a.m.  At the end, I concluded that if you 1) like going to church, 2) like thinking about the movies you watch and/or 3) don't mind following a convoluted non-linear plot, then \\"Tol\\" should satisfy you.  If you don't like doing any of the aforementioned things, then \\"ToL\\" will probably be a boring slog.<br /><br />I agree with the posters who advise viewers to watch \\"ToL\\" with a calm, contemplative attitude, because \\"Tol\\" indeed is not your conventional fun time at the movies.  The director Terrence Malick recklessly and audaciously is swinging for the spiritual fences and is daring to ask the Big Questions about morality, God's justice (or lack thereof), man's relationship to God, why even good people suffer, all that deep stuff.  However, Malick collides with the inherent, unavoidable problem any director challenging the infinite has: his literal, visual interpretation of God's mind is necessarily, pretentiously inadequate.  I am referring to the admittedly spectacular biological, psychological, paleontological, and cosmic images wafting through \\"ToL\\".  The quiet images, by themselves, announce to those who are receptive that, yeah, God is great and majestic.  No real problem there, even if time-worn, if Malick had left it at that and created a balanced version of \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", the 80's film that used human images to illustrate life's chaos.<br /><br />However, Malick artificially grafts this \\"divine imagery\\" to an earthy, earthly tale of the chronological history of a `50s Texas family headed by a somewhat disciplinarian, occupationally frustrated father (Brad Pitt) and gentle, compassionate mother (Jessica Chastain).  Respectively, they personify the perennial nature vs. nurture conflict (I prefer the word \\"nurture\\" to the vague term \\"grace\\").  Knowing them only by their last names Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien solidifies their symbolic status.  The true conflict revolves around the festering rivalry between the father and his oldest son Jack (Hunter McCracken as a boy, Sean Penn as an adult).  The languid, usually silent, and twisty progression of the family's life, beginning toward the end when it receives a telegram informing them of the death of, I assume, the second oldest brother as a (I think) Vietnam soldier, and the events that test their mettle and their faith, is also compelling, again by itself.<br /><br />But when \\"ToL\\" attempts to meld these two tropes, the mundane and the ethereal, I'm afraid it dilutes the power of both tropes.  I think I see the movie's purpose here; to show that God transcends mere earthly affairs and that the power of caring, of love, of nurture will quash the woes and cares of brute animal nature and will bring us peace, at least in the afterworld.  Again, it's a noble purpose that few movies dare touch.  But, you know, the result comes across as preachy and simplistic and as platitudinous as the well-meaning but hackneyed words of comfort the Grandmother (Fiona Shaw) gives Mrs. O'Brien after she gets that telegram.<br /><br />If Malick had exclusively taken the \\"2001/Koyaanisqatsi\\" route or \\"Great Santini\\" route, personally I would have more impressed.  By combining them in \\"ToL\\" it makes the effort seem a little self-conscious and forced.  Lovely and stunning as the \\"cosmic\\" images were, I would have excised them and kept the remaining family structure, even the dreamy, stream-of-consciousness elements intact.  That way, we could see the O'Brien family legitimately wrestle with their psychosocial and spiritual dilemmas (especially Jack's concern that he is emulating the less admirable aspects of his father's character) and arrive (or not arrive) at a resolution.  Frankly, the cosmic images are, I think, a tad artistically dishonest, because we the audience can witness them and perhaps take solace from them, while the mundane O'Briens cannot.  Too dues ex machina for my taste.<br /><br />Therefore, my verdict on \\"ToL\\" is ambiguous.  I aesthetically appreciated Malick's attempt at apotheosis, to remind us that love is the path to God.  But my intellect recoiled at the clich&eacute;d imagery \\"ToL\\" resorted to in order to demonstrate this, even if the movie had to.  But I can just envision posters telling me, \\"Don't think about the movie too much, just feel it.\\"  I suppose.  If you just let \\"ToL\\"s flow bear you along, it may make you feel better.  Very well - 3.5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />P.S.: Two trivial points - first, the plesiosaur depicted in the movie could never had curled its neck backwards the way it did.  Fossil studies show it lacked that flexibility.  Second, the raptor shown later in the movie probably spared the prostrate hadrosaur not because it was merciful, but because it was not hungry.haps take solace from them, while the mundane O'Briens cannot.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|Ever since viewing Hitchcock's \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" where a young girl suspects that the uncle everyone so admires is in reality a serial killer, I have thought that the most frightening psychological scenario is one where the victim is the only one who can see that the Emperor has no clothing, yet in this case, that there is a monster under the charm.  When she tries to get help in order to escape from his destructiveness, no one believes her because the narcissistic perpetrator has already effectively manipulated her potential saviors into believing she is mentally unstable & cannot be believed (think \\"Gaslight\\").  This is the story (which we have read before) of a young woman coming out of denial and finding herself involved with a malignant narcissist only to discover that all her allies have been enchanted by the monster's charisma & she has nowhere to turn.  What makes this story more compelling than most in this genre is the structure of the novel: alternating between journal entries four years apart so the reader both sees the perpetrator's slow acquisition of control as well as the victim's growing terror and then the sequelae of her traumatic experience.  It reminds me some of \\"Still Missing\\" by Chevy Stevens because both books focus as much on the aftermath of an abduction/domestic violence than on the trauma itself.  If you like psychological suspense novels where you are both fascinated and simultaneously terrified to see what happens next, you are likely to find this debut novel hard to put done.

B006PTL1QM|4.0|David Cronenberg likes to take on sexually and violently charged controversies, so it's not surprising that he was attracted by Christopher Hampton's play \\"The Talking Cure\\", whose storyline was based on the book \\"A Most Dangerous Method\\" by John Kerr, an exploration of the role that Russian psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein played in the relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung in the years before World War I. Christopher Hampton wrote the screenplay for \\"A Dangerous Method\\" as well, and that is evident in the strong dialogue.<br /><br />In 1904, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), daughter of wealthy Russian Jews, is brought to the Burgh&ouml;lzhi Clinic in Zurich in a state of hysteria. Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) wants to try the theoretical \\"talking cure\\" developed by Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) on her. Conveniently, Miss Spielrein turns out to be a masochist who is sexually excited by humiliation. Sabina recovers and enrolls at university with the intention of becoming a psychoanalyst herself. But her aggressive, raw sexuality proves too much for Carl Jung to resist, which eventually threatens his social standing and his already ideologically strained relationship with Freud.<br /><br />I was surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, because I have never found the work of either Freud or Jung the least bit interesting. I find them both largely fanciful. But there is more insight into the human psyche to be found in the ideological and personal conflicts between Freud and Jung than in anything those men published. There is real drama in their creeping hatred for one another. Freud's insistence on an exclusively sexual interpretation of clinical material versus Jung's increasingly far flung interests in parapsychology. This is exacerbated by conflicts of class, ethnicity, and personality. In walks Sabina Spielrein to stir it all up, in love with Jung but usually siding with Freud.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Keira Knightley overacted Sabina Spielrein's illness, but she deftly conveys Sabina's bright, self-possessed, but slightly nutty character for most of the film. Viggo Mortensen is unrecognizable as Sigmund Freud. It's not just the make-up. His voice is unlike I've ever heard it before. Jung is perhaps the trickiest of the trio to portray, as he is an affluent, respectable WASP, with wealthy wife and beautiful children, who, in spite of his criticism of Freud's practicality, is the most practical of all. He mistreats his mistress to protect his fortune and social standing. Michael Fassbender, with help from Christopher Hampton, makes us see his point of view, at least.tley overacted Sabina Spielrein's illness, but she deftly conveys Sabina's bright, self-possessed, but slightly nutty character for most of the film.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|My review can also be found at [...]    I absolutely without a doubt loved this book. The Forever Girl is probably in my top 5 books that I've read this year. I couldn't put it down and stay up until 5AM to finish it.    Sophia is a 22 year old wiccan, which make her the black sheep of her small Colorado town. She also has a constant buzzing of voices in her head that she wants to quiet. When she goes to a club with her friend Ivory and meet Charles, she learns the world is not as safe or simple as she believes it is and not everyone is who the seem to be.    The romance between Sophia and Charles wasn't forced and was more mature than most young adult romances. The back and forth with them had me going nuts and not in a bad way, it kept me wanting to read more to see if they would finally give in.    There were a lot of twist and turns throughout the story and just when I thought I was starting to figure it out BAM plot twist it kept me entertained from beginning to end. The story had a great flow to it, nothing was rushed and it progressed naturally. Rebecca Hamilton took the myths of vampires, shifters, and witches to a whole new level that I personally have not seen in anything I've read and I loved it. She also has an amazing writing style that made is very easy to completely lost in the book.    There was nothing I didn't like about The Forever Girl and I highly recommend it to any fan of the paranormal genre. I can't wait to find out what happens in the next book.

B001HBX8NC|5.0|There are a couple of recent Rigoletto DVDs that are most worthy of mention: this Zurich one and the slightly earlier (2005?) Dresden performance.  The latter has Lucic, Florez and Damrau in the three lead roles. Both this production and the Dresden production are quasi-modern, and both has their pros and cons in terms of staging.<br />Focusing on the music and singing, both Nello Santi and Fabio Luisi would justly be said to represent the old and new Italian operatic conducting school. Both give authentic readings of the famous score.<br />For the vocal acting side, the two casts are also fairly even.  Leo Nucci has the clear visual edge, being more slightly built and with vivid acting skills both vocally and dramatically. While he could not be said to be in the same vocal prime stage as Lucic, Nucci has the experience and skill to balance out any vocal shortcomings that beset his age.  His Rigoletto is very convincingly done.<br />As Gilda, Romanian coloratura Elena Mosuc is a tour-de-force in this genre of sopranos.  She is almost on par with Damrau in the Dresden performance, though visually a trifle more mature for this girlish role. Her acting is fine, but without Damrau's vivid vivacity and deep-felt pathos.<br />The standout in this Zurich cast is Piotr Beczala as the Duke. While not nearly as 'famous' as he is today, Beczala's lyrical tenor is adequately beefy for this role, yet without losing one jot of lyricism and tenderness when called for.<br />Piotr is now even finer as a vocal actor than in this 2006 performance, and one really looks forward to the coming MET season's Rigoletto starring Beczala and Damrau.<br />For those wanting a fore-taste of Beczala's ultra-fine portrayal of the Duke, this Zurich performance would surely not disappoint!

I personally loved the song Given up, Shadow of the Day, Hands Held High, Valentine's Day, and last In Pieces.  The whole CD is amazing start to finish if you keep your mind open as you listen. So many people have began bad mouthing this band for the change of path they took some even said this was the album the found God during.  I hate to bust people's bubble's but the lead singer of Linkin Park Chester as and always thanks God in each and every album they put out as the 1st person he thanks.  I have been a fan of Linkin Park from first CD and forever will be a true die hardcore fan of their's. Those people out there every band has to mature and make new music as their experiences change their lives they live and go along the path's of lives.  So keep that mind open and keep on listening to this band and supporting them.<br />I know I enjoy all types of music and I hope you do too.

0143119680|3.0|This is the first book I've read from this author.  Although it was a thick one, with an idea that's been about done to death lately (Vampires, Witches, Supernaturals, etc) I read it cover to cover.  It's well-written, interesting, somewhat intriguing and the characters are interesting with decent descriptions.  Some of the dramatics get old in a hurry as does the authors attempt at stringing along tense/teasing moments in the relationships.  It's very similar to Twilight, albeit written for a slightly older crowd (emphasis on slightly) and doesn't even touch True Blood [[ASIN:0441019331 Dead Until Dark  (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood, Book 1)]] (the Sookie Stackhouse Novels) or get anywhere near as insightful and emotional as Interview with the Vampire (one of Anne Rice's saner stories), but it still works if you're in to that sort of thing.  Upon reaching the ending, I realized that I may or may not be curious enough to read the next book in the series to see where it goes.  I think I'll read a couple of Laurie King books [[ASIN:0312427360 The Beekeeper's Apprentice: Or On the Segregation of the Queen/A Novel of Suspense Featuring Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes (Mary Russell Novels)]] to regroup and get grounded before embarking on another one in the All Souls Series.

B0011Z32PS|5.0|When Metallica's BLACK album was released, I bought the casette tape. It stayed in my car's deck my entire freshman year of college.  Like a lot of Metallica's music, the songs unfold over time.  Meaning the music is accessible, but dense, and you'll get a lot of nuances out of it on, say the hundredth time you listen to it that you might not have heard the first dozen.<br /><br />Because this albums was the first that had a couple songs make it onto some top 40 charts, a lot of metalheads disparage this album. But one thing to keep in mind is that the early 90's was a brief period of time in recent American music history when Grunge and Hard Rock and music with distortion and anger was actually popular.  The same thing happened to Iron Maiden's SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON.  \\"Moonchild\\" made it onto the charts, and all of a sudden there was this outrage amongst Maiden fans.  My point is that the BLACK album is a solid metal album that doesn't pull any punches.  If it came out today, I'd imagine it wouldn't get the same fanfare because, let's face it, popular music has gone soft. (Don't get me started).<br /><br />That being said, a lot of people suggest this album as a 1st Metallica album, seeing it as more accessible than their earlier stuff.  I'd disagree. A good analogy would be which Led Zeppelin album to buy first. Yeah, you can go with Led Zeppelin 4.  I mean, it's packed with iconic hit songs like Black Dog, Rock n Roll, Four Sticks and Stairway to Heaven, but really Led Zeppelin 3 is the album to begin with. It's a little rawer and less produced.  And because it doesn't have songs you've heard too much on the radio, it's easier to experience as an album rather than gravitating to the songs with which you may already be familiar.  If you're thinking about getting into a band and really trying to understand what they're musically trying to do- grab an album that's more or less a clean palate.  Similarly, RIDE THE LIGHTNING or MASTER OF PUPPETS is the place to begin with Metallica.  Sure, you may have heard a few songs, but not to the point where you're worked on any one of them. Trust me.  Both albums are masterpieces and worth listening to an infinite number of times.begin with Metallica.

B000OVLBIU|1.0|I started reading the Ghost Rider comic about 30 years ago and was excited about the first movie coming out and took my wife to see it.  Although I didn't get a chance to see the second one in the theater, I bought both movies on Blu-Ray when the second one came out on 3D Blu-ray.  Again, I found the first one thrilling and was excited to see the second movie for the first time.<br /><br />Then I popped in the second one.  After about 10 minutes, I looked at my son and asked him if he thought it was stupid and completely unlike the first one.  He agreed.  The Ghost Rider transformation was inconsistent with the first movie.  The performances were lame and out of character.  But most of all, the 3D effects....sucked.  There were only 2 moments in the movie that the 3D caught my attention, and one of them was near the end when some ashes fluttered down.  My son and I agreed that we had wasted 90 minutes of our life, but we watched the included documentary nonetheless, trying to justify some of the cost of the disc.  The director explained how filming in 3D is too expensive, but due to the magic of computers, you can film in 2D, convert it in post, and have equally stunning effects.  As I mentioned previously, the 3D stuff sucked, and now I know why.  Hopefully, you will too and not waste your hard earned money on this stupid movie...unless someone wants to buy it from me?  Yeah, I didn't think so.
B005LCECU6|5.0|What a pleasure it is to listen to early RUSH music. A bit rough around the edges - but well worth it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This CD requires several listening sessions before formulating an entire opinion. Initially, I was a little mixed about it but after listening multiple times, I have come to view it as one of Rush's best studio works in quite a while. Certainly, new fans will appreciate the musical talent of Rush as a 3-member act with this work but true, longtime, impartial Rush fans will also recognize that Lee/Lifeson/Peart are still at the \\"top of their game\\".<br /><br />I had read a few reviews mentioning how Geddy Lee can no longer sing in the same range as he used to and also how the mixed result of this CD sounded as if it was pieced together. While it is probably true that Geddy's voice is not the same as 30 years ago, the same can be said for Bono, Jon Anderson, Robert Plant and anyone else who had an exceptional range. Still-in-all, Geddy's voice is strong in this work and the musical synergy of the trio more than makes up for any \\"perceived\\" loss of range. One is too busy listening and enjoying than worrying about what keys that Rush is playing in to accommodate Geddy's vocal range.<br /><br />I listened on both home/car stereos and could not tell where the music was heard as being \\"pieced\\" together. Frankly, I was too busy focusing on the music, which is a 12-song effort. Also, perhaps I am just not that adept at being able to tell the difference at whether or not Geddy and Alex were in the studio at the same time that Neil was recording his tracks. In essence, who cares? The music is definitely seamless.<br /><br />My initial reaction about the musicianship was that it was stellar -- among the best that Rush has ever done. Neil Peart introduces some new drum rhythms, Geddy's bass playing is phenomenal and Alex Lifeson incorporates new ideas, new textures and new sounds that he hasn't really used before. One gets a sense of the cohesion and chemistry that Rush has enjoyed over the last 40 years of making music together. It is a rarity and one that has put them on a well-deserved high pedestal in the world of progressive rock. Surprisingly, many songs on this CD have a harder \\"drive\\" and, in general, are more hard-rocking compared to some of Rush's past work... Not bad for the three, who each have to be close to 60 years old.<br /><br />I won't go into what each song means. Just know that it's Professor Peart, hard at work, waxing poetic about the purported theme of the album:<br /><br />\\"In a young man's quest to follow his dreams, he is caught between the grandiose forces of order and chaos. He travels across a lavish and colorful world of steampunk and alchemy, with lost cities, pirates, anarchists, exotic carnivals, and a rigid Watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily life.\\"<br /><br />Each song on this CD is catchy in its own respect but some favorites here are \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"Carnies\\", \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", \\"The Wreckers\\", \\"Headlong Flight\\" and \\"The Garden\\". \\"The Garden\\" has a softer, ballad-like approach and demonstrates the vastness of creativity in Rush. In fact, \\"The Garden\\" is a significant achievement for them in their own right -- it juxtaposes the rest of the hard-rocking album with a final, softer, more humanistic song, replete with string ensemble, about the fragility of life and how easily personal achievements are lost, from one moment of being to the next. When I hear this song and compare it to the entire history of Rush, it marks a particular high maturity and importance...<br /><br />The more I listen to this CD, the more hooked I am. Although I saw merit in \\"Vapor Trails\\" and \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" (as I do in all of Rush's music), \\"Clockwork Angels\\" has so much more going on musically. There are so many new ideas incorporated that I find myself constantly vascillating between the heavy, rapid pounding beat of \\"Headlong Flight\\" and the ballad-like, well-orchestrated \\"The Garden\\" in my daily activities... \\"Headlong Flight\\" has the tempo of \\"Bastille Day\\" (Fly by Night) and \\"Analog Kid\\" (Signals), and (to me) is borderline metal. The same applies to much of Alex's playing on CA and it is really refreshing to see how Rush has evolved as a band. By the same token, they have put a lot of musical effort into this work and should be given proper due. They could have packed it in and retired many times in the past 10-15 years but they have taken the risks and surpassed them by far.<br /><br />Those who are still living in Rush's past days (e.g. Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions), as some reviewers seem to be, will not appreciate this work as much as those who can objectively listen. The musical architecture of \\"Clockwork Angels\\" reflects three legendary musicians with extraordinary musical vision, who \\"march to the beat\\" of their own music...<br /><br />On a final note, the use of keyboards is also reintroduced on this work in a tasteful, but not overbearing manner. Overall, Rush has put together a very formidable, respectable effort on \\"Clockwork Angels\\".ls), and (to me) is borderline metal.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I'm still learining some of the nuances of the app, but overall I love it!!!!! I am constantly writing to do lists and bucket lists so this app does everything I need it to do. However, I do wish there were more sorting options and that I could move an already produced and dated list into a date on the calendar without retyping it, but overall it does everything I need it to do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is smartly written and definitely a page turner. It was my first Gillian Flynn book and I will read others by her based on this one experience. I read this for my book club and we will have a lot to talk about - the characters are all compelling and bizarre.
B002KRFND0|5.0|This book is of the finest quality. Given the length of the text it is inevitable that the pages be thin, however, they are not flimsy. The cover is beautiful and over all this book really does impress. I am so pleased with this purchase; it was a gift for my husband and he loves it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I like this cover. It's lightweight, yet sturdy. The design is nice and sleek - I hate big and bulky!
0307888908|5.0|The best book I've read this year. So informative and very encouraging. This book gives the reader the principles needed to invest in their lives; both professionally and personally.
B0043EV774|5.0|I have a Panasonic Plasma 3D TV and this movie looks truly amazing on this TV.  It looks so good its almost too distracting, I find myself paying more attention to the aesthetics of the movie than the story line.  Whomever did the CG on the Chesire cat is crazy good.  This movie is awesome, I only wish there were more 3D movies that looked like this.
0345525558|4.0|A very good read.  It was our book club's selection and remarkly, everyone enjoyed it.  I found it quirky but enjoyable.  I am not a great fan of \\"time travel\\", but once I caught on to the author's pattern it did not bother me. I was fascinated by the research that the main character went thru in the pre-internet era, to discover the different meanings of the flowers. When the author was describing the library, I could almost smell the room.<br />I am intrigued to find out more about the language of flowers.<br />All in all a good summer read!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed book one of this series. However, I feel as though the actual writing could've been much better. If you can get past the somewhat inferior writing, the story is wonderful. Please note, the writing did not deter me from buying books two and three. Happy reading :)
B002RHL8DC|5.0|This series is truly excellent. It shifts the SG model a bit more to the cerebral, but allows for broad emotional attachment. Truly, a really well made series. Alas, it was cut down too soon. Hate the network, not the show.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just like Ender.<br /><br />If you've read the book, then you'll probably agree. If you haven't read it, then you should.<br /><br />Before I purchased the Kindle Edition of Ender's Game, I scoured the reviews in order to make sure that I was absolutely sure that I wanted to read it. Then, I downloaded the sample of the book, which in this case is oddly mostly the author's introduction with a tiny bit of the first chapter. Orson Scott Card's introduction of the book is an insightful look into the history of this book, and his words prefacing the book are still ringing in my ears:<br /><br />\\"Readers enjoy the book not because they can relate to Ender, or because they pity Ender. But Because they are Ender.\\"<br /><br />Those might not be his exact words, but they do convey the same point. While I was reading Ender's Game, I realized that Ender was me in so many ways. Although it's true that I don't live in a futuristic society where population limits are enacted and where an active effort to combat another alien invasion is underway, the themes that Ender's Game explores within Andrew Wiggin's struggles are exactly the things that I have struggled with during my own life. A world dominated by adults is not too far from our own, and throughout my childhood I battled the idea of conforming to our society. This is not to say that a world run by children would be better, but the dichotomy between our world and Ender's is that the power and influence children have is not completely ignored. Adults still have their deception, but so do Ender and his friends. They cheat the system, so he does too.<br /><br />This social commentary doesn't end with mere age and ideological differences, though, as the story also examines political and intellectual strata. The characters of Demosthenes and Locke are prime examples of all of these. From my point of view, intelligence is severely undervalued in our society, and Ender's Game brings this to light.<br /><br />There are so many profound motifs in this book that I'm not even going to try to cover them, but this is just to give the scope of the brilliance of this novel.<br /><br />Recently I decided to reinvigorate my library by having a Science Fiction literature renaissance, and Ender's Game was the perfect beginning for this goal. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy traditional science fiction adventures with sociopolitical and intellectual intrigue, especially if you are considering reviving your own childhood. Yes, I said \\"reviving\\", and I mean it. To say the least, this book affected me in many positive ways.<br /><br />Give this book a read and a thought, and it will provide for you a powerful memory - one that I believe I will never give up.
B001F3FUK6|5.0|As a huge fan of the first two Superman movies, I'm glad that Brian Singer decided to pick up Superman Returns with those two movies. However, there were some continuity mistakes which no one really seemed to mind. Mind you, I did mind and it bothered me a lot but not enough as to not enjoy this movie. We are led to believe that Lex Luther has never visited the Fortress of Solitude before, but he has. He visited it in Superman II.<br /><br />  Overall, this movie is a joy ride and it will be enjoyed by everyone, even women and older people. That was one of Brian Singer's goals. This movie has drama, angst, turmoil, a love triangle and (too much) humour by Lex Luther. This has always been one of the drawbacks of the Superman movies. They make Lex a comedian. This is why the Superman movies are never taken seriously. If you look at the Smallville TV series and/or read the comic books, Lex has never been a comedian. And even though Lex is Superman's greatest enemy, that doesn't mean that we have to see Lex in all the Superman movies.<br /><br />  For me, the highlight of this movie is when Superman flies to the sun to recharge himself. Talk about a boost! Up, up and away!<br /><br />\\"Whether you're an immigrant or you're born in the heartland,\\" said Singer, \\"at some point we all feel like an alien.\\"<br /><br />Of the famed Man of Steel, first introduced to comic book readers in the 1930s, Singer said, \\"He's kind of the ultimate immigrant. He comes from a foreign place, adapts to the value system, and has a special relationship with his heritage.\\"<br /><br />That might sound like heavy baggage for a film about a superhero, but Singer wouldn't be the first to read deeper meanings into comic book adventures.<br /><br />Singer sees Superman, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster -- two Jews who were sons of immigrants -- as a Judeo-Christian hero, part Moses, part Jesus. Like Moses, Superman is the boy dispatched down the metaphoric river to be discovered in the cornfields, if not the reeds, of the Midwest. Like Jesus, he has a kind of doubling with his father, voiced in the new film as in the 1978 Superman by the late Marlon Brando, who says, \\"The son becomes the father, and the father becomes the son.\\"<br /><br />Superman first entered popular culture when the Nazis were beginning to assert their power in Germany. He \\"never cleared up the problems in Europe,\\" Singer said. \\"He handled small problems; he served by example.\\"<br /><br />Over the decades, however, through numerous incarnations in comic strips, television shows, and films, Superman began tackling worldwide catastrophes, as he does in Singer's new film.<br /><br />...Superman Returns is a film with a long and troubled past. Over the last decade, numerous actors and directors were attached to the film, whose budget, like its superhero, seemed to know no bounds. None of that history worried Singer, who got a chance to reshape the storyline. It also helped that he used some of his regular repertory of actors, such as Spacey, playing yet another notable villain: Lex Luthor.<br /><br />While Singer wants as broad an audience as possible to enjoy the film, he particularly wants \\"older people and women to have an emotional experience,\\" he said.<br /><br />Credits go to Robert David Jaffee, (a contributing writer to the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, where this article first appeared) for most of this Review.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this everyday while on the treadmill. It is easy to see and I am so satisfied with this purchase.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|This movie will certainly return the viewer to not only high school years but the years of the 1950's. The malt shop, the dance, hanging-out, the drive-in movie and rumbles are set to the (then) songs of the original musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. One of the best dancers of all times, John Travolta, steps lightly across the stage with Olivia Newton-John, delivering a delightful sense of those long gone years.<br /><br />This creation will always stand as an epic musical.
006056251X|3.0|After seeing how highly this book was rated by other readers, I expected a bit more than I got.  The story was sweet, and I did like the main character, Evie, and Sebastian as well, but the story was slow and often lost my interest.  I am an avid reader and when I get into a book, usually cannot put it down for anything, but I found that I could not get into this story and would get distracted by other things, which, when the book is good, is unheard of for me. And the ending was too drawn out - I could have done without the last 10% of the book. I do not have any great criticisms of the story other than I found it boring. that is all i have to say.
1851775722|3.0|I suppose that I should have taken the \\"in detail\\" in the title of this work more seriously...  It is, indeed, a look at Nineteenth Century fashion _in_detail_- however, while the focus on details will please seamstresses and historical reenactors who want to know *just how* that bustle was sewn, I found the details a bit overbearing.  Many of the garments are represented by closeup photographs and detailed diagrams- but full-views are absent, and as an overall look at Victorian fashion this book falls short.<br /><br />That said, this book is clearly the fruit of much painstaking research- and the quality of the physical book itself is quite high.  The layout and diagrams of this work almost remind me more of a science book than an art book- it leaves me with the feeling of just having dissected some sort of garment in a bio lab.  For serious historical reenactors, this book is a treasure- but casual fashion-lovers and steampunk enthusiasts should steer clear of it.  It isn't the pictoral gallery of pretty 19th-century dresses I had hoped for-  but, after purchasing it, I now realize that it wasn't _meant_ to be.  (My sister, who has a more scholastic interested in traditional European fashion, loves it.)
B006LSZECO|5.0|There's not much you can say about GONE GIRL without spoiling the experience. No matter where you think the story is going, it isn't. READ IT. This is the book everyone will be talking about this Summer.
1612130283|1.0|That so many seem to love this series of books is baffling to me. It started out OK; the premise was something you don't always see. However, it quickly became one of the most redundant and boring stories I think I have ever read.  I read one review wherein the author stated the book seemed to be written by a teenager. I couldn't agree more. Christian Grey is so beautiful (which we hear about incessantly) that women everywhere swoon and trip all over themselves to get his attention. He's filthy rich, spends money on lavish gifts for Ana (who, of course, has no interest in material possessions...right), is into rough sex but only because he's been hurt and abused (enter pathetic \\"I can CHANGE him with my love\\" storyline here). Ugh, it's all so nauseating. Not to mention the non-stop \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" references. I honestly feel like maybe I missed something since SO many seem to really enjoy these books.<br /><br />One last point; even the sex scenes, which are supposedly the draw of the story, are redundant. Same formula: Christian looks at Ana, her insides churn, their tongues find each other, they get hot, they talk somewhat dirty, there's a little slappy slappy and then Ana inevitably \\"explodes\\" when Christian merely touches her \\"sex.\\" Laughable.
B00782O7NE|1.0|I had never seen The Artist and eagerly anticipated its release on DVD and Blu-Ray.  When Amazon offered a pre-release purchase, I went ahead and ordered the Blu-Ray version.  Well, playing it is sheer agony.  I own three Blu-Ray players, all high end.  On one player, it played the movie without sound (yes, I know it's a mostly-silent film, but it wouldn't play any of the background music at all).  The extras, however, played perfectly well.  Player #2 simply wouldn't read the disc and ejected it after repeated tries.  Player #3 played the disc.  However, getting to the movie is an ordeal.  First of all, the upload time is maddening and then moving through two separate sets of previews is frustrating.  Finally, when the movie was ready to play, it took what seemed like forever to begin.  And then when you stop, it doesn't remember where you left off (as it does with DVD's) -- you have to go through the entire nightmare again.  So, the movie is wonderful, but the Blu-Ray is terrible.  (There has happened before with Blu-Rays.  It's not worth what they say is a better picture.  I'm sticking to DVD's next time.)  Hence, my single star rating.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fortunately Amazon gives you the option of reading a sample if you have an Ipad.  Thank God. I was just so appalled by the male character in the story(Christian Grey) bossing the female character, Anastasia Steele around, stalking her, imposing himself into her life, seducing her with money and being a controlling ego hat the last thing I wanted to do was read about her having a sexual relationship with this creep.  Not my cup of tea.
B00459EZSU|5.0|I haven't come across a really well written and acted SciFi series since Babylon 5 but SGU is all of that for me.  I personally love the mystical/ascension themes they include and wish more shows would develop around this.  Well Done!

B0079R8KXG|5.0|I love this case for my Kindle Fire! Since the Kindle is secured by clips, there is no bulky casing to block access to any of the features of the Kindle. I also like the way it folds back to a standup position for viewing video, etc. One of the best features is how the cover foods back compactly when I am reading a book so it easy to hold. Great case for comfort, ease, and security of the device.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|First off I would like to say if someone handed you this cd for the first time without hearing anything else the band had made what would you take it as? It's something interesting to do with bands and Linkin Park was the first band that made me start thinking that. With Minutes to midnight they all collectively as a BAND started writing whatever they wanted. I want that. Some people just get so pissed off about that and it really does make me laugh when I see very dull reviews on how it doesn't sound like the old stuff... they suck and are sellouts. I will tell you how they've impacted me. ( If you don't wanna read then just scroll down.)<br /><br /> I full heartedly believe that this band is one of those bands that I took for granted because I heard numb when I would watch mtv in the morning before school and I liked it. I came from a heavy metal/hard rock background which was at the time pantera, lamb of god, system of a down, slipknot and others that would be too long of a list but those are some. They're still my favorite bands to listen to because they all sound different from each other! That is what is so great about music. Back to the story lol I heard bleed it out and I remember sitting thinking wow these guys kinda suck now.so then not up until last year I heard a thousand suns and for some reason I grew out of my old mindset which brings me to this. Linkin Park has changed my way of thinking with music. I didn't like the new stuff because I would sheepishly listen to their new stuff once for not even the whole song. (Which points to a lot of the people who wrote the negative reviews.)<br />OK! So out of this whole thing I learned that if you listen to something with an open heart and mind then you never know what you will end up loving. A lot of that had to do with becoming a musician.<br /><br />Linkin Park have come back with another solid album. Every album they come out with is like a picture of where they are and I really love that about this band.My opinion is they keep getting better.<br /><br />If you are a MUSIC lover then I recommend this cd for you. If you're looking for a one genre band then you simply just have to get off this page and look for it.<br /><br />Each song has something different great about it and that is why I can't choose a favorite haha! This wasn't a review too much on the cd but hopefully you can take something from this and learn that music can take you to places you never dreamed of physically and mentally. Experiencing everything from Hybrid Theory to this cd has at some point helped me through my highs and my lows in life. Thank you Linkin Park.
0345536886|4.0|This is really a solid 3.5 star for me.  But since it is the most entertaining John Grisham novel I've read in years, I decided to bump it up to 4 stars rather than bump it down to 3 stars.<br /><br />Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the only 2 partners of a two-bit law firm in Chicago who specialize in quickie divorces, DUIs, personal injury, and an assortment of other cases that are basically the bottom-dwellers of the law profession.  Oscar, a sixty-something grouch trapped in an unhappy marriage, spends most of his time counting the days until he can retire; while Wally, a forty-something recovering alcoholic, is forever coming up with schemes that he says will make them millionaires.  Then, one day, one of Wally's clients tells him about this drug that is supposedly causing people to die of heart-attacks; and suddenly, Wally's dream of riches and corporate jets does not seem so far-fetched anymore.  Armed with nothing but the testimony of a half dozen unreliable witnesses and a couple of pages of research done on the internet, Wally files suit against one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in America; and thus begins the hilarious story of 3 men's attempt to milk the justice system for a quick buck.  Joining Oscar and Wally on this misconceived quest is David Zinc, a 31-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer already burnt-out by the daily grind of pushing papers for a large law firm.  And when the pharmaceutical company choose to not settle like the lawyers of Finley & Figg expect them to, our erstwhile \\"heroes\\" has no choice but to go to court and fight till the end, nevermind that none of them knows the first thing about trial litigation.<br /><br />This is definitely not your typical John Grisham thriller. Instead of a hero who's fighting to right a grave injustice, you've got two sleaze-ball lawyers out to make a quick buck.  The author was careful never to take anything too seriously, so the result is a funny book that manages to gently mock the litigious society we've become without crossing the line into being sanctimonious.  Both Wally and Oscar are amoral but essentially harmless, so I found myself laughing out loud at many of their antics and their bumbling attempts to convince the judge, and plaintiff, and the cutthroat attorneys the plaintiff has hired that they actually have a case.  Interspersed with the shenanigans in the courtroom are the equally hilarious hanky-pankies that go on in their personal lives, which added an additional layer of comedy to an already vastly entertaining book.<br /><br />What kept this from being a 5 star or even a solid 4 star book for me is the predictability of the ending.  The absence of a hero that you can root for also detracted from the enjoyment somewhat, although David Zinc did his best to be a straight-man's foil to Wally and Oscar's inept villainy.  Still, I enjoyed this book tremendously and would recommend it to anyone who's got hankering for a legal thriller with a heavy dose of the absurd.
0060936223|3.0|Any book that mentions Jonathan Richman (as a drummer!) has something going for it.  Overall, I enjoyed the book as an artist's odyssey and chronicle of a deep and supportive friendship.  However, the endless lists of poetry openings, and clothing choices for events grew tedious in the latter third of the book.  Similarly, the lists of minor literary and cultural-scene figures of the time don't carry much weight today.<br /><br />Yet, those folks did create a fecund art scene for a few years that has retained its impact on art and culture.  What really drew me to the book was learning about that time and place when it came together.  As a bonus, we hear about it from the perspective of a genuinely starving artist.  The chapters about life in the Chelsea Hotel are wonderful, and anyone who has artistic sensibility would wish that he or she had the nerve of Smith and Mapplethorpe to drop into that milieu.  Smith really makes you understand what it would be like to be a relatively normal person who is befriended by Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, and who meets Janis Joplin (a few times) and Jimi Hendrix (briefly).<br /><br />Just as importantly, Smith explains how to become an artist.  In a phrase, it's hard work.  She and Mapplethorpe spent endless hours drawing, painting, reading (not Mapplethorpe), scouting around town for ideas, discussing aesthetics and philosophy, listening to music of all types, and more.  The intensity of their work time and artistic explorations is remarkable, and it's a lesson for today's budding artists who might be looking for a shortcut in our rapid-media age.  The depth of their artistic quest should embarrass anyone who thinks that their YouTube riff is art.<br /><br />While I'm not sure it's actually plausible, think about the routine that Smith said she lived for a couple of years.  Get up at dawn, and work in a bookstore all day (she says she left the Chelsea at 7 a.m. to open the store), and arrive home at about 7 p.m.  Grab whatever food you can afford, perhaps made on a hot plate in your one room in the hotel.  Then run down to Max's, and hang out all night.  Hard to believe she could do that even twice a week, not to mention every night (which is her claim in the book).  On the other hand, lots of us enjoy feeling that we have a dual life, and we put in great amounts of energy to both make a living and retain some type of artistic inner life.<br /><br />A final note.  During the week I read this book, my wife and I started watching the TV show \\"Wonder Years\\" on Netflix with our son.  The show focuses on a 12-year-old boy growing up on Long Island in 1968, and then moves forward with him for a few years.  Patti Smith moved to New York without a dollar to her name in July 1967, and the seminal events in the book take place in the next 3-4 years.  In other words, she was living 20 miles from the fictional \\"Kevin\\" in \\"Wonder Years\\" at the same time.  She lived in the world that was changing; he watched it from afar.  Ironically, he actually drew from a wider and more contemporary range of material because she, as an artist, ignored much of the culture that was around her.  And both were deeply changed by the times in which they lived.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read...should have bought all of<br />them all together! Had to start the second one right away. Not an every day romance book!
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|First off, 5 star movie of course. Heck, 10 movie really. Which is why I wanted to replace my old single disk full screen version with a widescreen version. And when I saw that Amazon was offering the 2 Disk for 5 bucks, well I had to spring on that.<br /><br />So two days later, the movie arrives and it is in French. The box art has everything in both French and English on it. I write Amazon and say, \\"This wasn't in the product description,\\" and I get a refund. I look back at the product page and realize that now, \\"Oh, now it's being fulfilled by a different vendor\\" I'll use my refund to buy a new copy and I'll just have a funny story about this French version.<br /><br />The new one just arrived and it is the exact same thing as the first.<br /><br />Is anyone else having this problem? Or can someone explain what the heck is going on? I plan on returning this version as I'm starting to get upset now as it's not mentioned anywhere on the product page that this is what I should have expected. And yeah, I can get the DVD to play English and with no subtitles but I don't necessarily want my collection to eventually look like, \\"Batman Begins   Le Chevalier Noir   The Dark Knight Rises.\\"

B003XVYLDU|4.0|Classic from one of the masters of Scifi, had heard about years ago and finally got around to reading it, worth the read
0606259090|3.0|If you have time look up 9 1/2 weeks. On amazon they explain 9 1/2 weeks as this \\"Their sexual excitement depended on a pattern of domination and humiliation, and as their relationship progressed they played out ever more dangerous and elaborate variations on that pattern of sadomasochism.\\" Does this remind you of something? On the other hand I enjoyed reading Fifty Shade of Grey. I will admit this book will not appeal to everyone. People who do not really like a romance novel where the guy is messed up and the leading lady is messed up herself then you won't like this. I personally like it when they are not perfect that the girl is shy and introverted but the guy who looks cool and seems to have everything is actually the most screwed up person.

1781161097|4.0|A longtime ALIEN (as well as Blade Runner) fan, I had extremely high expectations for the film, PROMETHEUS. Once they started releasing clips I started to scale back my expectations. (those clips in retrospect were edited and didn't show the entire scale of a sequence) I went from being enthralled for the first hour of the film to actually loathing it as I walked out of the theater, pondering where they could/should have gone. However I've seen the film several times since and have grown to love it. A lot of this has to do with David and the various other characters. I have my favorite scenes. I ordered the book as soon as it was for sale, read it in a day, then re-read it. I find it interesting that the original script seems to have all the elements that I initially thought were missing,(namely the Xenomorphs or ALIENS.<br /><br />The book is a nice collection of art, and unused concepts and gives a lot of background into the conception of the film. My only complaint is the it isn't large enough to include more of the conceptual art and unused designs. If you go online you can find thousands of images from the various artists. Hopefully there will be an even larger book at a later date; I'd really love to see what they would have found in the cargo hold of the \\"Juggernaut\\" had they chosen to go in that direction. (perhaps some of these concepts came from Giger himself, before he left the production?) Overall, a nice edition to your library if you are a fan of film making as well as these types of books and films.
0765316994|4.0|This is the fourth Scalzi I've read, and Scalzi proves again that he has a talent for dialogue, for character, and for crafting a clever plot in a bite size portion.<br /><br />While I would never call myself a Trekkie--I much prefer Star Wars, and I have never been able to buy into Roddenberry's vision of a utopian future where mankind has solved it's scarcity problems and given up money, but I digress--I've watched enough to know that the guys who die are almost always--always--the guys in the red shirts. They're unnamed extras, low level members of Star Fleet that die to provide some level of tension to the episode. And this book is through their eyes, through the eyes of the red shirted members of \\"away teams\\" that die at the first sign of danger.<br /><br />I picked up Redshirts because it looked clever, but I didn't expect any amount of depth. In fact, Scalzi's plot begins deceptively simple. He develops his red shirted characters with heavy use of dialogue that is fast and flowing, typical Scalzi, that is more difficult than it looks. That's part of what make's Scalzi so good.<br /><br />However, for the most part, the book starts with a gimmick, and rides that gimmick, for almost three-quarters through the novel. Then, without giving up any spoilers, a shift occurs, and suddenly the writing is serious, smart, and insightful, more a paean to writing than science fiction.<br /><br />And perhaps it's better I leave it there. The ending, the shift, was what made the book a four out of five stars instead of just three, but it was unexpected and almost out of place. In any case, it's good writing (despite occasional flashes of vulgarity that is not atypical of Scalzi), and I appreciated the way Redshirts ended, as much for what it said about writing as it said about Star Trek.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not a love story. it's a pornographic tale of two very disturbed people. You need a hot (not cold) shower after reading this to wash off the depravity.

0345803485|3.0|I must admit that I've read not only the first one, but all three. I liked the second all right, the third one was a complete disaster. The books are nothing but Cinderella or rather damsel in distress rescue stories. I've enjoyed reading them simply because I like to indulge myself in a dream about perfect prince as many women often have.<br />It is basically another Twilight story with way too many similarities to it.<br /><br />From a literary point of view the book is very poorly written and I must agree with many other readers pointing out hundreds of \\"blushing\\" \\"gasping\\" and \\"painting\\" The language is very repetitive although there are some funny dialogues throughout the books. Most of all the characters (especially virgin Ana) are way too young for such complex relationship the author aimed for
055358202X|1.0|Analyzed in a vacuum, this perhaps deserves 2.5 stars. However, there is just no excuse for the decisions RR Martin made here.<br />His previous book, A Storm of Swords, was a masterpiece. 5 stars. and he beautifully set up what was to come. And yet... in Book 4 he made the terrible decision of spending the time looking at characters who seemed destined to just spin their wheels the entire book.<br /><br />50% the book seemed to be centered around Crici wishing she had a penis, while gossiping to others and listening to her internal monologue about how awesome she is. Joffery at least produced hate, which is at least emotionally entertaining in a way. Circi just produced a bored sort of contempt.<br />25% of the book seemed to be about Bryien grasping at straws in the dark, and getting nowhere in the end.<br />The other 25% gave us just enough of a glimpse at truly interesting characters with true potential, and making us hate RR Martin for not letting us see them more.<br /><br />Oh well... im still psyched for book 5. I love Tyrion, Brandon, and Jon.... But if RR martin spins his wheels there because he wants to stretch the books out to make lucky # 7, I will not forgive him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved all of the hunger games series. I am so sad I am finished so soon. I truly enjoyed each book. Movies just cant compete with authors like this.
B005FISBTO|4.0|(light spoilers)<br /><br />i was going to write in this review that i was starting to lose interest in this series and this was probably the last season i would be tuning in for.  however, i just finished the last episode and the final cliffhanger was exactly what i had been waiting to happen since season 4 or so!  finally, they get to it.  i consider this a good thing though it also points to the flaw i found in this series which is the pacing of dexter's evolution overall.  on the one had people are going places in dexters world (ie debra being promoted) and as another reviewer mentions dexter is forced to confront faith, etc.  however, one thing really wears on me.  the random new serial killer that miami metro has to deal with and is killed after exactly and not before 12 episodes theme is starting to become its own cliche.  instead of a natural progression of events its starting to feel like some of the episodes and events are thrown in to help pace for the final plot twists.  its as if the shows writers have dexter's calculated methodology for how he kills as their guide for how they write seasons.  i understand it logically but emotionally after seeing the same formula several times now it kinda grates on me here.  i can't say any of the episodes in this season are flat out bad per se but just not that memorable.  as others have mentioned the first two seasons i thought were really strong (and are my favorite), the next few i enjoyed cause i was hooked, here i just wished they would have sped things along a bit.  while i would go back and watch seasons 1 and 2 again (and have already re-watched 1) i don't plan on re-watching this one.  still, more enjoyable then most of television.  i hold dexter to a high standard ;)

They did the same thing with Pink Floyd.  Are they deaf?  I know I'm not.  I won't complain about the bonus tracks but I hate having to remaster an album just to place it in my iTunes library.
0345803507|1.0|This last one was by far the worst. In spite of the same lame and childish language as the previous books, the plot in this one gets even worse. Ana's character is completely \\"without a character\\" from the beginning of the series. There's nothing merely interesting about her. The author makes her to be extremely smart, clever, and \\"know-how-with her man\\" in spite that she has never dated anyone before!!!<br /><br />She's all the best: kind, loving, polite, rising star at work, exceptional wife etc. She meets Christian who turns out to be his perfect match, and marries him in a matter of few weeks. That is already bad example for the young reader. Although its meant for a mature audience Ana's age and immaturity suggests otherwise.<br /><br />Perfect-and-ideal-all-the-ways Ana GETS PREGNANT BECAUSE SHE FORGOT!!! ABOUT HER BIRTH CONTROL in spite of having sex twelve times a day!!! Really?<br /><br />Even though I enjoy fairy tale stories sometimes, this one topped them all with a too perfect nonsense and dull ending just Ana's character. Blahhhh...
0071752854|4.0|As a young professional with relatively little pitching/sales experience, I found this book to be both insightful and motivational.  While pitching to anyone can be intimidating, this book demystifies the process and provides a motivational stepping stone to successful pitching, without being overly hokey or used-car-salesman-like. I have followed a handful of the techniques and have experienced favorable outcomes.  Quick and interesting read that you can take some new tips from.
1466401885|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, I got a little scared about purchasing after I read a few of the negative reviews but I was glad I went with my gut on this one.  Abby, the lead female role in this book was a bit frustrating at times, so much so, I wanted to jump into the book and slap her a time or two, but then thinking about it, she was been a normal 18/19 year old female.  Loved Travis passion for life and for Abby.

B000BQV52A|2.0|I had high hopes for this CD set, based on all the previous glowing reviews.  But, to be honest, I am disappointed.  I cannot deny the technical expertise of the pianist.  However, everything sounds too fast..almost like \\"Presto\\" is the marking for each piece.  It sounds...rushed.  Anyways, I will keep the set for reference purposes, but, my search for a personal favorite Beethoven cycle continues.
1936891026|5.0|I found myself cringing as Pressfield nailed yet another aspect of Resistance that I've unwittingly been a victim of. I do have to say, though, that people who don't get his sense of humor probably won't get the point of this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a avid reader and soon-to-be published author, I was completely appalled at the lack of depth, elementary writing, and lack of character development in this book.  Page after page, I waited and wanted for the book to develop or at the very least become interesting, but alas, I was disappointed all the way to the end.  Besides being poorly written, the story line was completely unrealistic and far fetched.  Save your money, and browse the internet for soft core porn stories instead.  This book comes up short. No pun intended.
B007MDB71O|3.0|I would like to say that I loved this movie but I can't. It has a great story line with the earthman being transported to Mars and meeting the inhabitants but the lead actor (I can't even remember his name) made it anything but enthralling. I'll try watching it again some time to give the poor guy another chance but I actually found it to be somewhat boring.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I looked forward to picking up this book while I was reading it, and was sad when I was too tired to keep reading before I went to bed. To me, this is the mark of a great summer read. In addition, the ending was satisfying - another mark of a great summer read. I went into this book with prior interest in the Kennedy assassination and as a moderate Stephen King fan (I have read and enjoyed The Stand, Carrie, and some of his short stories), and came out an even bigger fan.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|This movie was totally entertaining. I already am a huge fan of WWII movies as well as the Marvel Comics movies and this one was no disappointment. The introduction of Captain America was truly imaginative. Unfortunately I waited until after I saw The Avengers before viewing Captain America so I missed some of the references. I am so glad that I made the investment in purchasing the BluRay as I will be watching this over and over, it was that good!

B00006WL2B|2.0|This SACD is evidently a remastering of the original 1977 performance.  A redbook CD of the performance probably will sound much better.  Where is the bass energy?  I have no idea.  Listening to this through Sennheiser HD 600s powered by a Burson amp I could hear only the barest trace of frequencies below maybe 400 Hz or so.  Terrible, there is just no weight to this recorded version of the performance.  I doubt Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic had such pecuniary difficulties they had to lay-off the lower register instrumentalists on the performance that day; they either were never adequately picked up during recording or else EQd way down for this release.  Go figure.  Went to my 1989 performance by Lenny Bernstien in a digital recording and while I am sure there are better renditions, at least the gravity and weight of the lower frequecies could be heard.  Sounded fine to me.<br /><br />Beware this release.  Kleiber on D/G SACD of Beethoven 5th is just fine.  Now go figure again.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I spent months looking for a product that was of professional quality, good value for money and that was not made in China. This was an almost impossible task. But after a long search I finally found and chose the AKG K702's. First, they are made in Austria. If you recognize the \\"made in Germany\\" label this is equivalent. Over the ear fit with a fabric covering vs. the \\"like leather\\" on the ear headphones offered by its competitors are very comfortable. These are not sound cancelling headphones and as a result don't make your ears and head sweet over time. The sound quality is equivalent to headphones that are almost twice the price and are far superior to anything that Bose puts out. These are perfect for jazz, blues, most rock, classical etc.. I would imagine they are not fitting to hip hop or other heavy bass music genre's. The high's and mid range is great and adequate bass. Here are a few pro's and con's.<br /><br />Pro's:<br /><br />1. NOT MADE IN CHINA! If you are like me and sick of paying top dollar for Chinese made substandard quality, you will appreciate the quality of these headphones.<br />2. Sound quality<br />3. Great value for money<br />4. Great quality with interchangeable cords<br />5. Fabric vs. \\"like leather\\"<br /><br />Con's:<br />1. Bulky when traveling. I pack them in my carry on when I fly, but they are bulky.<br />2. The strap which covers my head when I wear them is a bit tight.<br />3. (I'm really struggling here to find real con's...) The elastic cord which keeps it tight over your head may need replacing over time.<br /><br />Enjoy and I hope this was helpful.
B005LAII1C|3.0|There is nothing like a foul mouthed teddy bear to make for a great movie. Personally I think Zach Galifianakis would have made a better Ted, but then again he has played the dysfunctional buddy role before. As a child John (Mark Wahlberg) wishes for and gets a talking teddy bear. Now that they are in their 30's neither one has grown out of their immaturity with Ted becoming an increasing problem.<br /><br />John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) demands that either Ted leaves or she goes. The humor is what one would expect from watching &quot;Family Guy&quot; with a lot of adult language. It spoofs other films and is critical of many aspects of society. It is politically incorrect. Like &quot;Family Guy&quot; some of the bits work and some don't. If you don't find one bit funny wait a minute and a new one comes along.<br /><br />Excessive f-bombs, sex, heavy drug use, no nudity.

B002P8O29K|5.0|This is an excellent documentary of the events that took place during The Rolling Stones 1969 free concert at The Altamont Speedway located in Northern California. The picture quality is great and the 5.1 sound is outstanding. Having watched this fine documentary I have come to the following top ten conclusions:<br />1. Don't use the Hells Angels as stage security because they will do a thorough job of keeping people away from and off the stage as long as there's plenty of free beer for them to drink. Whoever was responsible for hiring the HA should have been prosecuted for all bodily injuries inflicted to any innocent concert goer due to their very violent crowd control tactics. Talk about a foreseeable risk. I wish I could have been there though.<br />2.Do not pull out a gun and shoot at the stage when the Oakland and Frisco chapters of The Hells Angels are in charge of security because there are astronomical odds that you will not live to attempt another shot. Meredith Hunter was clearly killed in self-defense.<br />3. Marty Balin should not have thrown a tambourine at some Angels and then jumped off the stage into the crowd to fight with them. His own stupid decisions led to him getting knocked out. Did he really think that he would be treated differently than anyone else once he challenged an Angel ? I know that some rock musicians of the time were treated like gods by the fans, but come off of it.The Jefferson Airplane were from San Francisco and were well acquainted with the Hells Angels at this time, so he had to have known better.<br />4.Paul Kantner should not have mocked the Hells Angels at all, let alone over a microphone in front of 300,000 people. This only served to add fuel to the fire and caused an immediate and predictable response. What was he thinking ( see comment #3 ). It was a good thing that Grace Slick showed some common sense and tried to diffuse the tension or Kantner could well  have received a beating as well. What an arrogant moron. At least The Rolling Stones were from England and thought the American Hells Angels were just like the English version of the MC. The Jefferson Airplane knew exactly how they could be in certain circumstances, so there was absolutely no excuse for Balin's and Kantner's actions.<br />4. Keith Richards has got guts and plays a mean guitar. He could have got stomped due to his challenging an Angel in front of the crowd and the rest of the club as well. He knew there was a movie being made too, so his beating would have embarrassingly been caught on film.<br />5. Mick Jagger's ego took a beating before ( literally ), during, and after the concert. You could clearly see as Jagger sang Under My Thumb amid all the chaos that a H.A. member was glaring at Mick with a disgusted look on his face. This Angel appeared to just want an excuse to pummel Jagger.<br />6.The Hells Angels officers should not allow prospects and hang-arounds to help with crowd control while brandishing pool cues because they are going to use them to try to impress everyone.This will really tarnish your public image and lead the majority of society to deem your club as a violent, criminal menace even though you claim that you are not. It's hard to argue with the film footage of the beatings.<br />7. Sam Cutler came across as complete jerk and someone should have popped him one.<br />8. Drug use played a huge role in this tragedy. Some Angels actually can be seen attempting to reason with these intoxicated, out of their mind people to no avail. I hate to say this but some people got exactly what they asked for when they annoyingly persisted to climb out of control over fans, the Hells Angels, their motorcycles, and other security personnel to get up on the stage, which I'll agree with Sonny Barger was negligently built in height. Maybe the fact that they had to change the concert site so quickly had something to do with this obvious error in judgement on the part of the people in charge.<br />7. Sonny Bargerknows how to make a cool entrance. I wonder if he knew they were filming the concert? If not, he seems to have a good sense of style.<br />8.Terry the Tramp loved to dance to The Rolling Stones music and looked cool doing it.<br />9. Annie Mae Bullock was smoking hot and I wish that I could have been that microphone and mike stand ( Sock it to me indeed ! ) Tina is also a better singer and performer than Mick Jagger and he clearly lets the viewer see this through a facial expression and some words he utters when he realizes that he now must follow her on stage in film footage from a previous concert on the tour ( Madison Square Garden I believe ).<br />10. In my opinion and not related to the movie, The Rolling Stones should have done everything humanly possible to keep Mick Taylor in the band. They have never sounded better than when he was playing with the rest of the group.They probably were the Greatest Rock and Roll Band of all time with Mick Taylor, instead of Ronnie Wood. The band sounds superb in this DVD.<br /><br />All and all this DVD is not boring to say the least and contains some nice extra's. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in The Stones, Hells Angels, the events that led up to this tragedy, or the 1960s.knows how to make a cool entrance.

B005S0HNU2|3.0|Received item in decent amount of time, the case was cracked and broken in a couple places and the dvds were region 2 which I found couldn't be played in any dvd players in the US where I live.

At least the dvds seem to play ok w/o any major scratches on them.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|The film that attempts to wrap up the X-Men Movie Trilogy is an adequate film. \\"The Last Stand\\" does wrap up the story line, but as a fan of the comics and growing up watching the TV-series in the 90's could never give this X-Men blasphemy better than a 3-star rating. The film did succeed in giving plenty of twists and questions, especially to start the film, yet most did not match the X-men comic franchise. The story does give a decent bit of back history to Jean Grey. The action does not stop and culminates in a mutant vs. mutant great battle. There are tons of characters; almost all of the mutants from the 2nd X-Men movie return and 5 significant new ones arise (Beast, Multiple Man, Juggernaut (not that he is actually a mutant), a specific sapping mutant, and a certain elegant flying one). Too many characters are either physically or 'mutantly' eliminated for my taste.

034580404X|4.0|I have read a lot of the reviews out there and just recently finished the series. I for one enjoyed the books. The premise it self is nothing new, if you take away the BDSM factor, its your typical meloncoloy leading man and the innocent but smart leading lady. You can definately tell this is the author first novel, the writing is a little rough but not that bad. I've read really great writing and i've ready really bad writing and this fits somewhere in the middle. I understand that some people are not the comfortable reading the subject matter at hand but i have to wonder then why they even bothered picking up the series considering they probably knew what the book was about to beging with. The main herione does tend to be a little annoying but when dealing with what and who she has to deal with i don't blame her. Most people called her stupid for agreeing to go along with his commands but if they actually READ the book you can see that she held the power right at the begining. The acutal BDSM scenes are not THAT bad, but i can see where readers might get a little squimish. All and all i really enjoyed the series. People just have to keep an open mind and take this book for what it is.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|at first when I heard about this app I didn't think it was so special......but now LOVE IT!!!!!:) I'm sooo addicted to it....it is so much fun:-)
B000K7VHQE|4.0|A good film, that shows the interplay between different characters and family members. Alan Arkin does a great job as the supportive grandpa. Abigail Breslin is great in her portrayal of Olive, the young aspiring Little Miss Sunshine. The family goes on a trip that tests their resolve and closeness. A film that has a good message that is shown through family adversity as well as quirky triumph. Winning isn't everything.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was definitely a great read. This book brings everyone back to the basic scheme of things. No matter if you're a beginner or an advanced lifter, this book hits the principles and fundamentals of lifting weights. As the author stated, many topics have been debated time and time again.<br /><br />As I was reading this book, I had a few \\"raised eyebrow\\" moments. For one, according to new studies, the GI index isn't as important as we've made it out to be. Yes, insulin spike from high GI index good can play a factor, but the effect isn't dramatic. Therefore, I wouldn't cut out many of the foods the author has listed. Rice cakes? White rice? Etc....everything can be had in moderation no matter if it's a snicker bar or ice cream. At the end of the day, we eat to hit our daily macros no matter what food we're eating, but the difference is that obviously, not everything is created equally as the author mentioned. That being said, I wouldn't cut out half of what he listed. I love rice! I thought brown rice and white rice had the same GI index if not close? So, why cut out one and not the other?<br /><br />Secondly, I may have to disagree with not doing cardio after a workout. Before a workout, yes as we're depleting our glycogen storage before picking up weights for muscle building, but if we're on our cutting phase, why not burn a couple hundred more calories after a workout session and call it good? Either way, we'll be burning the same amount of calories whether we do cardio hours before or after our workout. Doing two a day workouts is an inconvenience for some.<br /><br />Lastly, what is wrong with doing low intensity cardio on a cut or bulk? The stair stepper or incline walk would burn much more calories than a steady run because of the resistance, so why avoid low intensity cardio that hits the far burning zone instead of the cardio zone? HIIT is a great workout, but maybe more so for people that are trying to lose weight, butdepending on the person's activity level, it may do more harm than good because it is a grueling workout. 20-30 minutes of that is overkill and nobody would be able to do 20 30-60 minutes sprints for 30 minutes. The author did explain the pros and cons, but I just wanted to reiterate Low intensity cardio, but then again, this can also be debated.<br /><br />One other thing, I'm a believer of eating whatever as long as its balanced, your getting your proper nutrients via veggies, fruits, or multi vitamins, and fits within your calorie intake and not solely your macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat). But, ensure that you're targeting your protein intake as it is the muscle builder.<br /><br />Overall, I was impressed with the book as it was simple and straight to the point!
0385737955|5.0|This book will keep you turning the page. The chapters are very short but you won't want to put it down. The end sets the story line up for a very exciting sequel.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I've found this to be one of my favorite apps. not only can you use it like regular youtube, but you can use it to down load videos or the audio of a video. my entire music play list came off of it. highly recommended!

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Wow - this is a hot book - I have blushed all the way through it - an education as well as eyeopener! Wasn't sure what to expect as it is a surprising book but onto the third book now!
0439023483|5.0|I'm not that into the Harry Potter or Twilight series but this book and series captivates. It has a strong female protagonist and moves along at a good pace. Once past all the exposition, the book is difficult to put down and leaves the read hanging on for more by the end. So I got the rest of the series. Two thumbs up. I see why it's so popular now and why it's been made into a movie.<br /><br />Taking place in a future society where a major war has left the populace under the watchful eye of a dictator big brother government which sends it's teenager in to an arena to fight for their lives for the entertainment of the elite, live the experience of being chosen and then taken from all one knows into a world of fighting for oneself the eyes of Katniss Primrose. By book two, the attachment to the characters and situation becomes much more personal. Great for teens and adults.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not usually into \\"romance\\" novels but this book was absolutely wonderful.  The story, the sex, the whole \\"fifty\\" is awesome.  I wish I had a Christian Grey.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|My cousin made me see the movie and it was incredible. The next day, I bought 2 copies of the Rock of Ages soundtrack. It is incredible- ALL 20 songs are done by the actors in the movie.The song has the actors names by it so you know whom is singing the song. I never knew Tom Cruise could sing(not bad). My only complaint would be against whomever autotuned Julianne Hough- she has a pretty good voice without it. Her voice should have been left as is. The cd ROCKS. I am actually thinking about checking out the original Rock of Ages. If you enjoyed the movie, get the cd.
B00845PV16|5.0|Ok dig this, I gave this five stars (movie is really high four) just to counteract others bull roarasorous and oh so trendy negativity when it comes to any move staring Mr. Cage.  All of Cages recent movies have been panned by the fluffy brained primadonnas in the press, are you a fluffy primadonna? No? Then you will probably have a great time watching this fun movie. In fact I challange anyone to name a modern actor who is consistently more entertaining and stars in more enjoyable, action packed, no stupid brainwashy message, fun movies than the great, yes I said it, the great Nicholas Cage.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is so worth the seven bucks because you can go any where you want I love it as I said before BEST APP I'VE EVER HAD!

0345803493|3.0|The 50 Shades trilogy continues and if we thought Christian Grey was dark before with his BDSM way of life now he gets even darker.  In the first book we were left wondering why Ana can't handle a rough spanking and are eager to learn if she and Christian will EVER make it as a couple. As Ana tries to figure out if Christian is willing to sacrifice aspects of his lifestyle for her, we venture into Christians tainted past.    The beautiful language and imaginative writing continue as Ana's godess looks up from her book every time she has a thought. I'm still extremely annoyed that Ana calls her vagina \\"my sex\\" and still having a hard time trying to imagine an attractive man with copper colored hair.    But regardless, the drug that is the 50 Shades trilogy held me in it's grasp for a second time and wouldn't untie me until it was over. And yet again, it left me spent and wanting more.
B006YB9VJU|3.0|The biggest gripe I have is that you cannot disable or enable GPS!<br />The instructions are horrible they consist of four pictures telling you to turn on NFC etc.<br /><br />You will need to get the XPeria Smart tags app,<br />You will also need the liiveware manager app, even though you downloaded and installed the Xperia smart tags app it is not what you will use to configure the tags.<br />Liveware app is what you will use.<br /><br />There needs to be an update to enable you to turn on and turn off GPS<br /><br />As far as function goes they work as advertised I am using them on a Samsung galaxy Nexus Version 4.1 on Verizon<br />As far as price goes they could be cheaper but you are basically paying for color and convenience because the generic ones don't look as nice as these.<br /><br />I am hoping for an update to the apps but considering that these were made to function on a Sony Xperia phone I don't see the updates coming anytime soon considering Sony will probably update their own Xperia app first
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|there was not one moment that i wasnt in love with both Matched and Crossed. i read each in four hours. i was so enhanced in Cassias story i felt like i was in her position. i often found myself crying now and then. Condie detailed the scenes so beautifully. i couldnt have asked for more of a heart melting sequel. AND SHUTUP ALL YOU BAD REVIEWERS!!!!!!! sorry :@
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love my sonic screwdriver!! I am so glad that I ordered it, and it sounds like the real thing!<br /><br />I was a little confused when I read the packaging, because it says that it makes 2 different sonic sounds, and mine only makes one. But you can make the sonic sound using 2 different buttons, so I'm guessing that's what they meant.<br /><br />Doesn't really bother me, though, because it's so cool!!<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase!! :)
B0086700CM|4.0|well this game is super fun and addicting. its good to pass the the time when your bored some people are annoyed that its Endless, but I think that's pessamistic. I like to think no one has ever been able to get to the end.
0345803507|2.0|I wish I could have been spared from 50 Shades Freed. Sure I read the first two books faster than I knew humanly possible but this one took me FOR-EV-ER.<br />In 50 Shades Freed Ana and Christian are married and on their honeymoon and as with the previous two books, they face a singular, life-threatening situation where everyone ends up okay in the end thanks to Christians amazingly convenient security detail.<br /><br />Then after a while, the sex scenes got dull and I found myself skimming over them silently hoping there would be no more.<br /><br />I am of the opinion that the 50 Shades trilogy is one book too long, though some would argue that there should be none at all, and others that it isn't long enough.<br /><br />And finally, if I wasn't horrified enough at how dull this final book was, I found myself completely disgusted as Ana makes the revelation, \\"She likes sex already,\\"about the dancing child in her belly after a kinky sex session.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I purchased the movie hoping to watch it on my iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV. Due to the restive nature and non-consumer friendly UltraViolet digital download, I can't enjoy the movie as I'd like.

B002RKSZKI|5.0|The ebook was delivered quickly and efficiently. It was my first time using the kindle. I am very satisfied and have kept reading ebooks.
B002MJV75O|3.0|I received this set as a birthday present two years ago. I am a huge fan of the show!<br />The interviews, extras and the short bonus soundtrack were great inclusions to the series episodes, but the way the discs are housed is atrocious! I had to yank some of them out, as they had been fused somehow - by pressure or by stray adhesive - to the cardboard. Bits of glue and paper stuck to the discs, and sliding them in/out of the slits too much can cause abrasions to the data surface.  Luckily my town still has a video store, and I was able to have them cleaned - otherwise I would have had a hard time watching the majority of the episodes and it would have been like a wasted $100+.<br /><br />Great show, great compilation, terrible packaging!
B000FBJAEG|3.0|I had read one of the Michelle Maxwell-Sean King books out of order, which I enjoyed, and decided to go back to the original.  The plot was good, and kept me interested and \\"turning the pages,\\" but I found the various twists, turns and details a little too complex.  When I read a murder-mystery like this, and I have read many (especially Michael Connelly), I like arriving at the final scenes and finishing knowing exactly what happened and understanding how we got to that point, and this book had so many characters and details to follow that I found myself straining to put the whole thing together.  But overall, I like Baldacci and would continue to read this series.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was prepared for a modest effort when I picked this up and pleasantly surprised to find an artfully written piece that drew me into Vaelin's imperfect world.  In a lot of ways, the early journey of Vaelin reminds me of Ricco's emergence in Starship Troops, as he sheds the angry boy and becomes something far greater and yet still so very human.  Even the ultimate failure of the campaign against the Empire (no spoiler since you start right from that point) and how you reach that point draws you into Vaelin's world and Ryan's smooth narrative while building the depth of his universe.<br /><br />If there was one complaint about the story it would be with the naming conventions, which stuck me as more Roman than Northern, but that is more a matter of personal preference than anything else.  His structure of the society, the competing religious beliefs, and their affect upon not only the society he lives in but, Vaelin's moral struggles are neither preachy nor superficial, providing an underlying strength to his characters while slyly misleading the reader from greater truths that perhaps should be more obvious in hindsight.<br /><br />Unlike others, I don't think the end is absurdly anti-climatic.  It is the period before the end exclaiming through simple understatement that everyone, including the Reader, has misjudged the practical evolution of Vaelin's strength both physical and moral.  Even discounting that this is book one of a series, the obviousness of the text's conclusion, it was never meant as a climatic end to this chapter of the seris, as the story's narrator believes, but simply a conclusion and perhaps emotional turning point for the narrator to understand how little he really knows about the protagonist.<br /><br />This was artfully done.
B00005QCVT|5.0|Bought this movie for my daughter, hoping it will deter her from thinking about what drugs can do. It worked for my oldest daughter and she recommended it to her sister.
0345803485|5.0|Obsessed. I found myself completely infatuated by the way the story pulled you in. Got the book Friday night, finished it Saturday. I just could not put it down. Since then, I've already finished the 2nd book and am on to the 3rd. Nothing better than a book that draws you in, makes you feel what the characters feel and keeps your attention for hours on end. The book is so descipt that you don't feel that any details have been left to your imagination. Beautifully written by an amazingly talented writer.
B007PF7MGS|3.0|Eager to read this book, (have his other books on kindle) but unfortunately this ebook is not available to Australian readers yet!:(
0441009425|1.0|I really enjoyed the first books. They were slow getting started but I put it down to careful plot building. There are a number of interesting sub plots. The final book in the series, Absolution Gap, is just plain ridiculous.  Mr. Reynolds abandons all his subplots in what appears to be a hurry up finish. Maybe he got tired of writing? I could have put up with the mediocre book plot to get to some closure on the series long subplots. Nope.<br /><br />Once I buy into a series, I think I'm owed more than he delivered. I'll never read anything by him again. This was not a question of an author finding his voice. In some cases, a writer visibly improves or changes as his writing progresses. This is just  a bad ending.<br /><br />He should have stuck with astronomy.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game can be addictive but they also want you to spend money on things you need to complete it and that annoyed me.

0345803507|1.0|I decided to read the 50 shades trilogy after all this sudden hype and excitement over it... And 2 days later, I still don't understand what all the fuss is about :/<br />If you strip away all the sex, BDSM, spanking and more sex, it's just a less than mediocre love story (if that's what people call it now a days)...<br />Apparently the author gained \\"inspiration\\" from the twilight books.... Ok, here's the first problem.. Why is a middle aged woman gaining inspiration for her debut novel from a ridiculously over rated book targeted at young teens?!<br />Ive thought about splitting why people shouldn't bother reading this book, into bullet points.. Here goes:<br />1) the 50 shades trilogy is unbelievably similar to the twilight books... The characters personality rival to that of the characters in twilight.. As the whole world of 50 shades was opening up, I could easily guess who was who... Anastasia
0425263908|4.0|I think it's funny how many people have left 1 star reviews with comments that this book is a knock off the Fifty Shades series. First the Fifty Shades series started out as Twilight Fan Fiction, The story is basically Edward and Bella Fantasy Porn. Which is fine, who doesn't love a sexy fantasy, but lets not pretend like it's a piece of artwork displayed in a museum. Second, anyone who reads romance novels consistently knows that they are all basically the same. After the Twilight series was published there were hundreds of vampire series published (i.e. the JR WARD series, Kresley Cole, Gena Showalter, ETC)    It irritates me that people are claiming that this writer has stolen the fifty story or is plagiarizing because there are lots of books out there with similar themes. Maybe these readers are new to the genre, so they haven't read them. So they see a recommendation on Amazon and suddenly Sylvia Day is plagarizing.    I have never written a book review before because I find that they tend to make me biased. A perfect example would be the Fifty Shades Series. I thought it was terrible. I tried three times to read it. I read half the book and literally could not finish.  It felt like reading a teenage girls fantasy of what adult life was like. The constant inner dialogue of her thoughts in italics. \\" i'm touching Christian\\" \\"beg for it Christian\\" \\"Holy Cow\\" The forced british style of writing. it was like a parody of an erotic novel.    Whereas, Bared To You was written like a true erotic romance novel should be. Sweet and hot and haunting. True Escapism. I couldn't put it down, I stayed up until 3 in the morning to read it.  I actually stopped at one point to check online to see if there was a second book because I was worried that It was going to end and I'd be done with the story. The next day I found myself re-reading scenes that pulled at my emotions.    So, no, romance newbie these are stories aren't museum worthy art work. But this was a great book. I believe that other SEASONED authors have been and will continue to write similar story lines. It's what the romance genre is and how it thrives.  I for one, hope that \\"wealthy emotionally dysfunctional men who meet and fall in love with clingy women and then have torrid sex admist a few arguments for several hundred pages times a sequel or two\\" is the next big thing in the romance genre!
B000000W5B|5.0|The best of Stones, this is a really underrated album.<br />If your a STONES FAN, as I am, I wore this out on vinyl..time to renew it.<br />The song WINTER, is prbly the most beautiful song I've ever heard, then again there are so many for instance Led Zep,\\" I'M GONNA CRAWL\\".AMAZINGNESS !!!!!<br />The closest you will get to the greatest of LED ZEPPELIN, their greatest albums, TRAFFIC, CREAM, DERECK & THE DOMINOES, Beatles<br />J.H, ETC... !!!!!<br /><br />Thank the Gods for pure rock n roll, that will never die, but can never, ever be replaced by the greatest rock n roll bands, which pretty much ended in the 80's....<br />There is nothing happening today, a bunch of kids with nothing to say, you don't even feel the music, where is the magic,  why would I want to. ?!<br /><br />If your a true Stones fan, this is a must have.....

B0070NSPCU|4.0|It's been a while since I've read such a deeply satisfying story, especially in the epic fantasy realm. A wonderful premise executed in a enjoyable way. A few issues with the editing, but nothing a good editor won't solve. I don't look forward for the long wait for a sequel, I want the whole story now.
B007P06DO0|5.0|Almost every element in this premium box set is a must for any lover of Graceland. The additional audio products are fascinating & vital to understanding the origins of this seminal disc, while the accompanying DVDs bring back the exuberance of the album and the time.  The written material + pictures also help fill in the artistic evolution of Graceland (as well as the ensuing political fallout). I do have to comment on the one element I discarded along with the shrink wrap: what's a grown man going to do with a huge poster of the album?
B000003GBN|5.0|Fritz Reiner is conducting - what more needs to be said.  I must admit to liking the Carlos Kleiber 5th, but this one is poorly taped and monaural and if, as I can, you ignore that it's a really worthwhile but not must-have CD.
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|It is amazing how Robert Harris manages to hit a chord in every person.  What is fear?  Do ordinary things affect you?  This is a book that will keep you wishing there were 28 hours in a day.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have re-watched Season 4 over at least 5-6 times. I won't even begin to count the number of times I have watched Always..especially the Rick and Kate final kiss. I am a true shipper of Caskett and  have watched the show since Season 1. Castle is tv at its finest. I am not an avid tv watcher due to the large reality themed shows and junk displayed but Castle is the reason I will reserve time in my schedule each week for a Monday night of enjoyment. Season 4 is all about Castle and his love interest Beckett. He has stated his undying love for her but she has a ton of baggage holding her down and preventing her from \\"having the relationship she wants.\\"  Most of Season 4 is on cue with the exception of a couple of episodes..namely Heartbreak Hotel. Ugh.  The not miss episodes include Rise, Cops and Robbers, Kill Shot, Pandora, Linchpin, Eye of the beholder, Cuffed, Always, Undead Again, The Blue Butterfly, Once upon a Time, Dial M for Mayor, Till Death do us part, 47 Seconds, Once upon a Crime, Dance with Death. In fact, I would not miss any of the season eps since the writers of Castle leave clues and foreshadow like no other detective drama has ever done in the past. Castle is for the crowd that does not mind thinking while watching. Listen to the commentary on the past dvd sets to understand the actions of Caskett and cast. Check out the enormous fanfiction and fan websites surrounding Castle. A show with this cult following cannot be wrong. If you love Castle..you will treasure the DVD.  Is it September yet?!
B008FWI8OA|5.0|This show is the best show I have seen on network TV sense Lost for me. I do love Person Of Intrest but they are both good in there own ways, I just think this is a better show, better acting because there is a larger group of awsome actors and the twist n turns. Love it! Give it a try you will be glad you did!
0345529057|5.0|The 4 Book Set of Game of Thrones came to the house in an extremely timely manner. Books were new, as promised and exactly what I had expected. There were no glitches in billing or delivery and I am reading Book 1 as I write this. The only thing I can mention is for those of you, like me, who find paperback print hard to read, eyesight and all, shy away from the paperback book set. Maybe a large print or hardback book. This set is perfectly fine and there was not a problem, it's just my eyes.
B00009AQMJ|3.0|I had great hopes for this recording and I was quite disappointed.  It's not terrible but it isn't in a class with the one that you should buy, same music played by Rachmaninoff.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read review after review of this book and because of those reviews was reluctant to buy Dance of Dragons. As soon as I finished book 4 though I couldn't NOT get book 5. I'm mid-way through the book and I'm flying through it. Pieces are starting to fall into place , loose ends are coming together and the story is as engaging now as it was in book 1. Sure, new characters are introduced into an already huge cast of characters, but they're bridging the gaps between Westeros and Dany. I'm very glad I bought this book!
B008EQIA7W|3.0|I rented it on Amazon prime and streamed it to my set. Very satisfied with the HD quality streaming, but ensure you have good bandwidth to take advantage of this if streaming. Overall the movie was decent for a sequal (To Clash of the Titans), but really didn't offer anything that was a surprise story-wise. It has great effects and a large-scale plot, but overall lacking for any real character development or real ties to the viewer. I just wasn't invested in the outcome of the battles (you knew good would triumph over evil and it looks to be a really predictable way. So for what its worth it was a decent sequal, and worth the rental. I would not make a buy recommendation based on the content of the movie.

B007YH9CVA|5.0|First of all, in case you weren't aware:<br />Even though the seller's don't specify the date and venue of this item, Abbey Road Live recorded each stop in Peter's 35th  Anniversary Tour in 2011<br /><br />My Review:<br />Although I bought the original 2-album set in the '70's after hearing \\"Do You Feel...\\" on the radio, I never considered myself a Frampton fan...that is, until Peter & Co. rocked the Inner Harbor of Baltimore last year!<br /><br />Peter led 2-blistering sets [3-hrs total], including 2-songs he wrote before leaving Humble Pie - \\"Shine On\\" & \\"Four Day Creep\\". The highlight was an encore of George Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".<br /><br />Once an 18-year old guitar prodigy, the now 62-year old musician's vocals and guitar playing was magical! He also had a stage presence rivaling the best in the business [i.e. Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix, and Bono...among others]. As Peter himself stated in an interview with the famous radio host Redbeard [on a 4th bonus cd], \\"I'm in my element when I'm playing live\\". And it was clear from the first song who was in command that night as Peter commented on people who were either arriving late, or couldn't sit still.<br /><br />I hope Peter continues recording, and more importantly playing live...he sure made a fan out of me!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I really like this game. There are three levels of courses with probably 20 courses per level (60 courses in total). But you have to score par or under to get the next course unlocked. It is TOUGH and gets tougher as you progress. With the addition of some achievements and bucks you can earn you can purchase skicky-balls or other fun stuff to help you along the path, but the courses do get pretty darn difficult pretty fast. It gets a -5star recommendation for price and playabilty as well as overall challenge.
1592400876|4.0|Great book for the punctuation impaired!
B005LAIGPU|5.0|This is a great flick, I fell in love with the trailers and believed this to be potentially the coolest film of 2012. It fell short of expectations only because the hype i placed on it, but it was still real good. I bought the blu-ray edition with the extra footage. I enjoyed the additional scenes and character story added. Because I was over the hype I felt I enjoyed the movie even more this time. Then I watched it again the other day, and still loved it. It is such a fresh and amazing concept, the story has heart, thrills, emotion, and depth. Plus if you are a fan of Akira you will see a lot of similar distinctions and elements between the two movie's characters Tetsuo and Andrew. I hear they are gonna butcher and remake Akira to take place in the US, that is a horrible idea. Chronicle has already done that inadvertently, but they did it perfectly. This should get a best picture Nom, they nominate garbage like Extremely loud... and that Michael Oher movie, so why not this?
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For such a small sharpener it works great. I'm very impressed with this little thing and it fits anywhere you want to put it. Its great for a survival kit. I really like it because it takes the guess work out of trying to get the proper angle to sharpen the blade. I'm sure you could sharpen any size knife with this but i would suggest only pocket knives cause its a lot easier and faster due to its size. The sharpening rod for serrated blades works good to BUT!!! after sharpening a few times with the rod it ends up flattening out the serration because the rod is tapered and most knives have have different patterns of serration on the blade.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|blu ray didn't make the movie look that much better, but I love this movie and I didn't own it on dvd so I figured I would just get it on blu ray since it wasn't very expensive.

B007Y2W44W|4.0|I was introduced to Nile with their 2002 release 'In Their Darkned Shrine' and since then have anticipated each release with anticipation & HUNGER!! So what have the Egyption Death Metal Gods delivered this time? Its still contains that Nile signature: Extreme Drum work by George Kollias, Fast Paced (Guitars) Heart Pounding, Deep Guttural vocals by Karl Sanders & Dallas Toler Wade<br /><br />At the Gate of Sethu is exactly what i had predicted and proud to say, Its showing Nile move forward and they did it like a Magician pulls a Rabbit out of a Hat, no struggle, no double take. This may not be ' Album of the Year', but its still the same Nile that delivered 'Annihilation of the Wicked' (One of my favorite albums ... Period!)<br /><br />At the Gate of Sethu 4.5 / 5 well executed and bound into becoming a Death Metal Classic! .... For fans of 'Face Melting/Ear Bleeding/Crapping in Your Pants' Metal' ;P<br /><br />SUPPORT Nile!
B008764ZQ4|1.0|Ok, I can understand getting a compilation disc of these songs, but not covers by actors.  Actors not singers!<br />Just sample the songs and let them sink in for a while, once the novelty wears off you won't be listening to these again.<br />The songs aren't as creative as Moulin Rouge and the actors' performances so far from the originial it is karaoke.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game. it has so much diversity and never really gets boring. due to the fact there are so many games to play.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Best quality CD.  Couldn't be better if I bought it at the mall, but I saved $$$'s.  I'll be back for more.
0553582038|2.0|Did you ever have to write a term paper of a certain length and you kept stretching to make it? That's what GRRM seems to have done with the 4th in his Fire and Ice series. It's short on story and entertainment and long (very long) on padding (that I didn't care about - and I bet you won't either). The first three books were fun to read. This one, which will be my last, was a chore (and a bore).<br /><br />Do you think he did it for the money? Cause for sure, the guy can write - he proved it with three in a row. But this one was a swing and a miss, and a swing and a miss, and ...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love when the babies are born.  i wish there was a way to use my coins to buy acorns though.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Truly a great game to waste time with. I find myself always. Playing this game! You should definitely buy this game. One of the classic mobile games.
B00881VLCE|5.0|well worth the money I paid and u get a ton of free puzzles! The only problem I have with this game is I can't put it down!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't know if people who complain about this game on the Kindle are just diehard iPad users, but I just downloaded it to see if it worked on mine. It worked flawlessly, no skips, no lags, no non-read swipes, nothing. So, if you have a Kindle Fire, it works great. I play much more graphic and processor dependant games on my Kindle Fire. So, this little app doesn't even phase it.
0345803485|1.0|By chapter 6, I was annoyed and really wasn't into the book.  I figured I was crazy because of all the hype I've heard about it.  So that's why I checked the reviews, only to find out I'm not crazy.<br /><br />Other reviewers are correct when they say the characters are flat.  The story line seems immature. I skimmed ahead to some of the sex.  Of course, that is getting readers' attention (while others say it just gets too repetitive).  But, if I'm going to committ myself to 3 books, the writing and story need to be good as well.  But, it's not.<br /><br />Just started reading Hunger Games, and I'm done with the first book. Love it!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, references both Pauline Kael and James Bond and is a joy to view.  The appearance of Michelle Monaghan (Mission Impossible 3) especially revealing.  This DVD basically sells today for shipping and handling costs.  Monster good work by Downey.<br /><br />Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang presents superior film production values.  This film can be viewed with Robert Downey, Jr. in US Marshals and Mr. Downey's two Sherlock Holmes films for a very decent assortment.<br /><br />Clint Williams
B007N85ZXY|1.0|Great to have Neil Young and Crazy Horse back but this is not one of their better efforts. Very disappointing.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was a senior in high school when Daria's first season played on MTV back in '97.  I loved Beavis and Butthead but I related more to Daria because I was a nerd in high school with a few close friends.  This show was refreshing to watch because it portrayed a young woman, who was intelligent and didn't follow the trends.  She was and is an individual, something that I am.  She and I are very similar in our personalities as well.  In part, I enjoyed the witty humor, not like a lot of the shows today.  I wish they would bring back Daria as an adult because I would have loved to seen how she would have turned out. I,too, was disappointed that the songs were not included in the set nor was any extra stuff came with the boxed set but I am happy I can pop in these episodes into the DVD player and relive the show.
B003IY49S4|3.0|I bought the box as a somewhat afterthought after purchasing a classical Mercury selection.For my purposes,the jazz box<br />contains about 10-12 cd's that I am happy to have and will rarely if ever play the remainder.At the price point not<br />much reason to complain though.<br /><br />Addendum :<br />I may have been too critical for the collection based on my likes and dislikes.For someone who wants exposure<br />to the many facets of jazz,this collection is a great starting point and a bargain at the price.My three<br />star rating should be higher for other potential buyers.At least 4 or 5 stars.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|This a fine piece of work with excellent writing by Pat Metheny. The big hero of this CD, besides Pat - of course - is Antonio Sanchez, who is in my mind the best young Jazz drumer alive, besides the 87-year-old master and bundle of energy that Roy Haynes is. I like the way he adds colors to all songs and how he rides the cymbal a la Elvin Jones. My favorites were \\"Roofdogs\\" (really a nice hymn) and \\"Signals (Orchestrion Sketch).\\" Chris Potter on tenor sax sounds too much like Michael Brecker, who was never a favorite tenor sax player of mine. I can easily tell that Chris was a ex-alto sax player by his intonation and lack of that tenor tone/volume of say Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane, Stan Getz, Charles Lloyd and Pharaoh Sanders. I must confess that alto sax is an instrument I don't care too much about, except for Johnny Hodges, Art Pepper and Paul Desmond. Ben Williams aquits himself very well on the bass, with a rock-solid bass line reminiscent of my favorite George Mraz, \\"the Bad Czech.\\"<br /><br />Interesting that the name \\"Unity Band\\" is inspired by the band of the Unity Church in Kansas City, Missouri (Unity Village), which Pat, his brother Mike and their father played or arranged for many years ago, while never members of that church.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing the Unity Band at the 58th edition of the Newport Jazz Festival on August 4, and more extensively at the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center on Long Island the following day!
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|I'm a big Joe Walsh fan and have been waiting a long time for some more of his solo stuff.  This album is a very good return with the title track, \\"Wrecking Ball\\", \\"Spanish Dancer\\" and \\"The Band Played On\\" being stand out tracks for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game ish so addicting. And a good way to pass time. Great on the kindle fire so far. c:
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I own about 6-8 of the selections on lp and would like to have all of them on lp's but that is not going to happen.This<br />collection is the next best thing and I am happy to have it.The recordings and the transfers to cd are well done.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I have seen this film twice, both times IMAX 3D, both times with my wife and 11-year-old son.  This is my review after seeing it the first time:<br /><br />Let me say at the outset I am more of a fan of Ridley Scott's work generally than I am of Alien per se, although I have enjoyed it and all of its successors (albeit in varying degrees). But I am much more of a fan of Blade Runner than Alien, for example, and also films of his like Black Rain, Someone To Watch Over Me, Kingdom of Heaven and of course Gladiator. So it was with tremendous anticipation that I awaited this film, but NOT because it necessarily had anything whatsoever to do with Alien.<br /><br />I followed every bit of the viral marketing campaign and all the tidbits in places like this (Prometheus-Movie.com), and read a lot of pro and con reviews before I got to see the film. I have to tell you that exposure to all the spoilers I encountered by doing this did not reduce my viewing experience one bit.<br /><br />I brought my wife (also a big Ridley Scott fan) and my 11 year old (he is very mature for his age), who had been watching Alien, Aliens, and Alien Resurrection on the Sci Fi channel, so he knew all about facehuggers and chestbursters. We saw it in IMAX 3D which is definitely the way to see it.<br /><br />I have to say, my mind was totally blown by this film. I was absolutely riveted for the entire duration. I thought that among the key characters there was very rich but very subtle interplay that gave deep insights into their motivations and personalities. Of course, Fassbender's portrayal of David was sheer genius and may get him an Oscar.<br /><br />And the visuals of the film were peerless. It looked real and I was totally lost in the experience. The pacing was great, it moved faster and faster which dragged you along for one hell of a ride. It is the \\"2001\\" of our time.<br /><br />So many aspects of this film are still churning around in my head, but the key one that is surfacing is that this was NOT a scientific mission in the sense we think of it (the way NASA would execute it), it was a last ditch attempt of a dying man with virtually unlimited resources at his disposal to try and find something, anything, to cheat his death. There are multiple layers of story wrapped around this that will make for much pondering (and repeat viewing), but that is the core.<br /><br />The people who complain that this doesn't answer all their questions about Alien or the SJs etc. are missing the point. In all cases of science, or anything for that matter, the answers you get do really lead only to more questions. The same way in Blade Runner (Director's Cut) where it ended with Deckard and Rachel leaving Deckard's apartment, reaching for a future together into the unknown, Prometheus leaves many things open for us to ponder and wonder at. That's what makes it a great piece of art, to me, as opposed to something that sewed up loose ends in a pedestrian fashion.<br /><br />In time this will be viewed with the same reverence as 2001 and Blade Runner, for sure. For me, it already is.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />This is my review after seeing it the second time:<br /><br />I am typing this 39000 feet over Colorado (gotta love Virgin America). So, my wife, son and I saw Prometheus for the second time (again in IMAX 3D) and we still loved it. I noticed the 3D more this time...it is very subtle, it just adds a \\"hyper real\\" feel to the film until the star map, and then whoa!<br /><br />I also saw a number of things I missed the first time. I had missed the fact that you could hear the Engineers talking to each other in the hologram in the control room of the Juggernaut. But mostly I missed some of the things Weyland said.<br /><br />Now it seems much more clear to me. To me, the film really is about Weyland and his attempt to cheat death, and his willingness to use anyone or anything to that end. That is what drives the plot, even though that is not evident from the start.<br /><br />I think with the perspective of time, people will see this as the equal of Blade Runner or even surpassing it. And what other movie in recent memory has kept you thinking about it, talking about it, arguing about it. That is what separates a work of art from just a movie.<br /><br />******************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />In closing, after thinking about it another week or so, the only thing I would add to the above is to emphasize the \\"Blade Runner\\" like aspects, in the study of David as a character, as a PERSON, with his motivations and, yes, emotions.  A fantastic film.  Even my wife wanted to see it a second time. All these Alien junkies are complaining because it didn't spell out in crayon all the questions raised in Alien. Guess what? IT WAS NOT A PREQUEL. I feel sorry for these folks because a great movie was right in front of their faces and they were too blinded by their expectations to even see it.  2001 left a lot of questions hanging, as did Blade Runner...as did the beloved Alien.
B004YEZBW0|5.0|Great add to the Harry Potter collection we have and will last for years of viewing with me and my kids

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds Seasons is a very nice addition to the angry Birds collection. You get two years (2011 and 2012) of Angry Birds that are based on Holidays, seasons, with a bit of mythic creatures thrown in. There are a multitude of the various birds, that do different things. My favorite is the orange one that blows up like a balloon, and then deflates like one too. This game has kept kids of all ages entertained; from a kindergartener waiting for someone to pick him up after summer school, to a very impatient teenager with anger management issues, and adults waiting for the fireworks to go off on the 4th of July. So far this summer, it has been a lifesaver.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game to waste time with during the day or night or while on vacation. For free it is a good time waster.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my daughter loves it. I can get her to do chores just to earn playing time. it is cute and fun &amp; a great kids game!
B007NZDES0|4.0|Sade's fans are quite enthusiastic and loyal and friends saw this concert tour in 2011.  Overall quite entertaining and tight.  Her hits are fun.  there is a bit of sameness to her songs and performance so two hours can get you sleepy.  But she is great to watch, over 50 years old I believe.  She is one of the good ones.  I didn't got to the concert in Charlotte because the ticket prices were sky high Las Vegas style.  too much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I completely and utterly obsessed with this series. Although the the sex scenes are quite steamy, there is some much more to it.  Incredible writing within this fantastic story line make the characters come to life. I have been a reader in the past but because of my busy work and home life I had gotten away from reading. Well, these book have brought me back to something I really enjoy. I finished the entire series in 5 days and couldn't help myself but go back and read them all again to pick up on the tiny details I missed when I just couldn't put it down. I have worked with abused and neglected children and never truly grasped why some children still didn't do well after they were \\"saved\\". This story has shed some light on that and will do doubt help me in the future.
1469984202|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book, but I will try to keep it concise.<br /><br />First....I'm shocked its self published.  I've read several self published books lately, and have almost found new enjoyment looking for spelling, grammatical, and plot errors.  But this book had none that I can recall!  Maybe there are a few that I missed, but if so, they are very minor and infrequent.<br /><br />Second....I really enjoyed how the first few books 'jumped' protagonists.  At first I was a bit put off and confused by it...but after a while it actually added to my enjoyment, and in some way felt like it gave the plot momentum.<br /><br />Third....Although the general post apocolyptic theme is nothing new, Hugh Howey somehow has put a fresh spin on it for me.  This point is difficult to put into words, but for me it was just the overall \\"feel\\" of the concept that felt new to me.<br /><br />Fourth....I enjoyed the way he describes things & developed his characters without slowing down the plot.  Some authors can get extremely long winded, and the plot seems to get stuck for a while.  I don't sense this in Wool at all.  Instead, I can completly envision this place and easily imagine myself being there.<br /><br />Fifth....There is definate social commentary about our current world going on.  But its not blatant or in your face.  It does however make you think.  In my mind, any book that makes you think, is worth a read.<br /><br />Sixth....While technically its considered in the Science Fiction genre, I quickly recommend it to any lover of fiction.  There is no Sci Fi jargon, or lasers, or space aliens, or anything like that.<br /><br />So in my mind, its likely the best deal out there on Amazon right now in terms of $'s/enjoyment.
B00139B39E|5.0|Saw DT the other night live. It was an amazing show. They are incredible live-great musicians. The opener Crimson Projekct was also superb. Prog rock lives in the year 2012!
B007OAAK0O|3.0|Musically it is not up to today's DVD concert standards but it is a record of a true diva.  Even the incredible tight clothing she wears and she is not so young.  It was fun to watch but musically did not deliver.  probably a one time watch for me
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I've watched this concert on DVD over and over again, it's so good.  Jason Mraz is a well rounded musician with a cultural vibe that will entertain you and have you looking for more.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game on ipod touch and was so happy to see it for Kindle! Works great... lots of fun.
B0083GCK5G|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about buying this album.  I loved the Beach Boys from the 60s and even into their later stuff.  But I really doubted that anything contemporary could be true to the Beach Boys' sound and character.  I was SO WRONG!  This album is absolutely outstanding.  The melodies, the harmonies, the instrumentation -- everything is there, and it's fresh and wonderful.  I can't stop listening to it!<br /><br />Don't deprive yourself another day -- buy this and enjoy it over and over!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was captivating from start to finish.  My college age daughter wanted to read it.  I figured I would read it as well; so what the heck was all the fuss about.  Yes there are whips, chains and other things, but the reaction is not what you'd expect.  Is it a fantasy to feel that way or not?  You may not agree with exactly what's done in the book, but it's very interesting. The shear passion and want they share for each other is something most people dream of, it's okay to dream.  You are brought into a world of lust and wonder.  Time just rolled by upon reading this book.  I just downloaded the 2nd one on my Kindle Fire. I cannot wait till it comes out in the theaters.  I am so glad I purchased it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game very addicting and a lot of fun. love to play it daily and it is something I look forward to.
B00062PN6I|3.0|I bought a bunch of these to use in the studio for monitoring.  My first impressions were quite positive - they sound much better than you'd expect from a $10 pair of headphones.  These aren't reference quality and should not be used to mix, but for monitoring or casual listening they work great.  The problem came after I used them for more than a few minutes for the first time.  It seems like no matter how low I set my audio, even when casually listening and not competing with live sound, my ears start to hurt.  I've found myself resorting to wearing them off my ears a bit, which really negates the positives of the sound quality.  It's like they need holes for the sound pressure to escape.  I went as low as one bar of volume on my MacBook Pro, which is really pretty quiet, and still after about 30 minutes of listening my ears were in pain.  I'm tempted to drill holes in them somehow but I doubt if it would even work.  I saw this very complaint on some of Behringer's [[ASIN:B000CZ0RMY other headphones]] reviewed on Amazon, but was surprised to find myself the first mentioning it here.  I have other over-ear headphones from Sony that I can listen to quite loudly and not have this problem, so there is a serious flaw in the design that may be easy to overlook for the $10 price but I worry they will ruin my ears over time.  I'm giving them a three because they sound really good for the price, but I was tempted to give them a two because even though they sound decent you can't use them very long at a time without worrying about deafening yourself due to the sound pressure.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|I was so excited when I heard Aqua was coming out with new music last year! I finally purchased this CD, and am extremely happy with it. While the price was too high in my opinion for a CD (who even buys CD's anymore?!) this was one CD I was willing to pay for. The music is very much like the old Aqua stuff but new as well. If you're a huge Aqua fan, you will love this CD!
B000GRUS22|5.0|I don't know what else to say besides what else?  It's Enigma.  I love their music and have all their CD's and this one (Posteriori) is no exception - a great listen, over and over again.
1849163863|5.0|This whodunit is set in Scotland's remote Isle of Lewis, inhabited by religious bigots and bored teenagers (I'm allowed to say that because my great-grandad escaped the place for a career in Glasgow). I'd better add that Lewis folk are mostly decent, law-abiding and considerate of other people.<br />First of a trilogy, the most striking thing about Blackhouse is Peter May's unusual structure, which gave me both surprise and delight. It begins with crime-fiction's usual grisly murder and a cop (in conflict with his boss) sent to investigate. Then without warning the narrative switches to first-person autobiography, a flashback to schooldays. I blinked, then lapped it up. What a welcome difference to the police procedurals that cram bookshop shelves.<br />The story unfolds with regular flashbacks. Obviously the kids of that island school are going to appear as adults enmeshed in the murder mystery.<br />There's a thrilling finish with the killer unmasked.<br />I'm looking forward to the second book in this Lewis trilogy. This opener is five stars for me.
B000UJ48UO|1.0|Full Metal Jacket is one of the all time American movie classics. I have wanted a copy on Blu-ray forever, so imagine my total let down when I played this for the first time and found my copy has the worst sound levels you can imagine. The picture is super crisp and without flaw but I had to run the volume up to 70 just to hear the dialog. All those years wasted waiting for the best quality and the copy I have had for 10 years is still better to watch. I do hope that mine is an isolated copy because this classic deserves better.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I was very surprised to find that these cables are excellent plus the price is very reasonable.<br />Amazon.com has done an amazing job on these cables & for putting their name to them.<br />I wonder when they will make different lengths of video/audio RCA cables. I only found these for the moment!

0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because, like so many of the other reviewers, I had heard SO much about how great it was! I couldn't wait to sit down with a good smutty novel and be impressed. sadly, this tops the list of worst books I have ever read. it was actually painful to finish it.<br /><br />the ONLY parts that are even readable are the parts that consist of sexual encounters (which, by the way, are ridiculous , somehow become more boring as the book continues, and everyone is climaxing every ten seconds). Everything leading up to, and following the sexual encounters seems like filler.the reason?! THIS IS TWILIGHT FAN FICTION! I recently discovered that this book was originally written as twilight fan fiction, and all the author did was change all the \\"Bella\\"s to Ana, and all the \\"Edward\\"s to Christians. This explains why our leading lady wears converse and jeans for her big sexy evening, wears her hair in annoying frizzy pigtails, rolls her eyes and bites her lip every paragraph, somehow doesn't own a laptop even though she just graduated college as a lit major, and is painfully unsure of herself.<br /><br />I could say so much about how horribly written this book is, but i think i would rather say this:<br /><br />To the women of America: If we think this book is \\"liberating\\" or symbolizes sexual empowerment....we have got a really big problem as a country.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|AMC did it again! After the succesfull first season they brought the series back to a second amazing season. The suspense and special effects are awesome.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I'll be honest and say that I wasn't all that excited about The Book Thief. While I feel like YA fiction is kind of in a great period right now, there's still a serious signal-to-noise deficiency out there (as there is in every genre, to be fair), and knowing that the book touched on the Holocaust didn't fill me with hope. (This is not meant as a slight on the Holocaust so much as a comment on the fact that it seems like a staple for bad writers hoping to wring out an emotional narrative that wouldn't otherwise exist; moreover, when books like Night exist, how much more can you truly say that hasn't been said more painfully and hauntingly?) And yet, I found myself absolutely wrapped up in The Book Thief, and much of that has to do with the voice of the narrator. Rather than allowing the titular thief - a young orphan being raised in a small German town as the second World War breaks out - to narrate her own tale, Zusak decides to give the telling of this tale to no less a personage than Death. It's a gutsy choice, but a brilliant one, as it gives the book a far more universal and haunting feel than it might have had otherwise. Let a gutsy orphan tell the tale, and the book could easily slide into sentimentality, or be just a simple coming of age story set against the backdrop of the war; let Death narrate, and the tale becomes far more sobering, as the effects of the war can never be forgotten, no matter how peaceful life seems in the small German town. The story mixes a lot of elements - a love of books and words that leads to thievery, a Jewish refugee who's made a name as a brawler, a young boy obsessed with Jesse Owens - and at times, the book feels dangerously close to slipping into chaos or absurdity. But somehow, it never does; even the more absurd elements feel loaded with portent and danger, a nice side effect of Zusak's writing and scope that always reminds the reader of the dangers to come. While The Book Thief is definitely a book about World War II (and to some degree, the Holocaust, though it's treated as part of the overall devastation and death dealt out by the war), in many ways, it's more of a story about words and their impact, and the way that simple gestures can mean everything, especially when they seem to do nothing at all. It's a book I was wary of, but I can't deny that I was deeply impressed by it; at its best moments, The Book Thief offers up something truly powerful and unforgettable, and any chance to expose a young audience to such things shouldn't be shrugged off.to some degree, the Holocaust, though it's treated as part of the overall devastation and death dealt out by the war), in many ways, it's more of a story about words and their impact, and the way that simple gestures can mean everything, especially when they seem to do nothing at all.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is exactly what I was looking for and is perfect for what I needed. I would and have recommended this app!
B007SGM084|5.0|I didn'think I would say this about this series... but I truely enjoyed reading this Trilogy. There was so much passion and  love it shows that if you truely love someone and they truely love and support you,you can over come anything. I would and have recomended this trilogy to my friends and family. It was an easy read and in the end I was looking for book number 4.<br />I am a BIG fan of Jane Austens and these books reminded me of the two main characters of P&P. The only difference was the kinky sex. The passion that Elizabeth and Darcy had for one another and the passion that Christian and Anastia had to me were the same kind. They were so in love that no one or anything stood in there way as long as they had eachother. Hope to read more from this author.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|- It's beautifully filmed.<br /><br />- The fighting scenes are exciting.<br /><br />- There are some humor too. For example the scene where the first time John met the Princess and rescued her from the airship.<br /><br />- The special effects are eye-catching. The landscape looks gigantic, life-like and awe-inspiring.<br /><br />- The love story is touching.<br /><br />- The acting is good enough.<br /><br />- It has 2 twists that I can't foresee. I'm sorry I don't want to say what they are because that would ruin your enjoyment.<br /><br />- It's a feel-good movie. In  the end, kind people get what they want.<br /><br />- It's a family-friendly movie because there is no sex scene and foul language.<br /><br />- Yes, most of the time it is predictive but it's still enjoyable because of the reasons listed above.<br /><br />I've watched it twice. The first time was in the theatre. The second time was at home. I own it on DVD. In short, it's one of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of science fiction or family movies
B006LSZECO|5.0|I picked up Gone Girl based on an odd coincidence - two unrelated people on my Twitter feed both raving about it within hours of each other - and it's a coincidence that I'm deeply glad for, because otherwise I might have missed out on this twisted, surprisingly, gleefully dark thriller. Gone Girl starts off simply enough: it's Nick Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary, but his wife Amy has disappeared. There are signs of a struggle in his living room, but otherwise - nothing. In alternating chapters, we see Nick struggling to find out the truth and Amy's diary detailing the idyllic early days of their relationship...but cracks start to show, and soon. And as the media starts to turn on Nick, we start to question whether Nick is as good as we think he is...but it's not long before Flynn starts to pull the rug out from under the reader again and again, until we're forced to question just about every single aspect of the book we've read so far. This is my first exposure to Gillian Flynn, but it won't be the last; even if we were only talking about the plot, I'd have to rank Gone Girl as one of the most involving and gripping thrillers I've read in years - I absolutely could not put it down, and found myself reading it every time I sat even for a moment. But more than that, there's Flynn's great writing, which allows her to create both Nick and Amy as complex characters based on nothing more than their own narration and discussion - characters that can still surprise you greatly in ways that I wouldn't dream of revealing. Gone Girl plays out brilliantly, all the way to an ending that seems to have really upset some people, and that baffles me; to me, the ending is a brilliantly dark punchline to the novel, a pitch-black immersion into the darkness that's prevalent in every page of the book anyway. (In fact, for my money, the ending elevates it from a good thriller to a brilliant one.) I've come across one person already comparing Flynn to the legendary Patricia Highsmith, and it's a great comparison; both seem to have a knack for understanding how people work, both have created absolutely legendary sociopathic villains (and, oh, is there ever a stunning villain lurking somewhere in Gone Girl), and both were willing to follow their characters to the absolute heart of darkness if it felt right. Consider me a fan already - I plan on reading Flynn's two earlier books as soon as I possibly can, but even if they don't live up to Gone Girl, I've still gotten one absolutely astonishing thriller out of this experience.and it's a great comparison; both seem to have a knack for understanding how people work, both have created absolutely legendary sociopathic villains (and, oh, is there ever a stunning villain lurking somewhere in Gone Girl), and both were willing to follow their characters to the absolute heart of darkness if it felt right.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|The second iteration of a re-imagined Sherlock Holmes offers a smart and satisfying story. Far more than mindless action, the superb effects and cinematography serve to augment a rich and interesting story, rather than serve as the primary feature. At its heart, A Game of Shadows is a mystery--and a very detailed one. I enjoyed the usage of period particulars playing into the puzzles that Holmes found himself solving. An imaginative movie that is thoughtful and visually satisfying. I recommend it!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I realize the title of my review may make it sound as though I don't like this book but I do, so let me explain while doing my best to omit any spoilers.<br /><br />I find that the Twilight series (which in many ways I both loved and hated) is very similar in formula to this series.  First, we have two main female characters who are both awkward, innocent, and unsure of themselves; each are heading out for a new chapter in their lives (Bella goes to Forks, Anastasia graduates college and moves to a new city.)  Both are innocent where men are concerned.<br /><br />Now lets move on to the men and the similarities between Edward & Christian.  Both, are very dominant males (although lets face it, pretty much any romance you will come across has a dominant male so this isn't surprising.)  Both are highly unusual/unique individuals, not your run of the mill average Joe by any means.  Would we want to read about them if they were?  Of course not.  Both men warn the woman away from them at some point yet find they just simply cannot stay away from her themselves.  Both are loaded with money/power and both reach outside of their comfort zones to keep or please the woman they want.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a winning formula for romance novels for any age?  Another thing I noticed while both reading the book and listening to it on Audible is the style of writing, both books (Twilight & 50 Shades) have a very similar writing style to them...this makes it very easy and fast to read, we comprehend it quickly, this will appeal to a great range of readers.<br /><br />Is it any wonder that I now refer to this as an adult version of Twilight? Yes, there's a ton of sexual content in these books but Mommy Porn?  I don't think so!  First, porn is very poorly written and I've read much more graphic content in other books.  Sex scenes have become as common place in romance novels as they are on television these days, it's a part of human nature and considering this is a \\"romance\\" sex is bound to happen for the characters.  We don't \\"fade to black\\" anymore and shy away from this type of content in any media these days we deal with it.  Besides considering the nature of Christian and the story-line between the two it MUST be included or you won't understand the struggle the characters deal with.<br /><br />Now to my minor complaints about this book.  First is the rabid over-use of \\"Oh my!\\" by Anastasia and similar verbage each starting with \\"Oh (insert word here)!\\"  I found when listening to the audio version of the book each time Anastasia said \\"Oh my!\\" In my mind I heard George Takei uttering the same phrase and lets just say that can certainly add a different dimension to this story! It gets both very irritating and distracting.<br /><br />My second complaint (in the audio version) are the e-mails sent back and forth between the characters.  Is it really necessary to read each and every character from each and every e-mail?  When reading the book the readers mind automatically skips over all of the time/date information.  Hearing it read out in each and ever exchange gets very tiresome indeed.<br /><br />Those are my main observations and complaints so the question now is, did I like it?  Yes, I really did.  I was warned off of it by an associate of mine who felt the author didn't do her research on the BDSM world.  I'm glad I didn't listen to her and read this story anyway.  I enjoyed it, I was entertained by it, I did become invested in the characters and yes, I found the BDSM portion of it to be believable.  Go into this story with an open mind let your preconceived notions about what you think it should be go and ignore what anyone else thinks about it...make up your own mind.  Personally, I think you'll enjoy it.bound to happen for the characters.  We don't \\"fade to black\\" anymore and shy away from this type of content in any media these days we deal with it.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|50 Shades is everything the media has been suggesting. Very erotic without question, but not particularly well written. A novel definitely not suitable for young, naive women who have yet to experience a normal sexual relationship, because there is nothing normal about Christian Grey's tastes. It has certainly lead to interesting dinnertime conversations between women of all ages and raised many male eyebrows as they listen in. Love it or hate it, you will certainly be educated about a world in which few of us have ventured beyond late night fantasies.
B003E20ZQA|4.0|My opinion is humble. I am insignificant, not only stature but in life experience and cultural tenacity, realised whilst reading 'Just Kids'. However, Ms Smith never makes you feel this way.<br />Her writing is warm, she is like a warm and nurturing friend, never arrogant.

B0070XB0N6|5.0|As all Gaiman's books, this is quite a dark story about a brave girl called Coraline, but who is often called Caroline. Coraline is a very smart girl but she is often ignored by the grown-ups around her. Coraline gets in big trouble when she opens a mysterious door and arrives to a place where everything looks like her world but not exactly the same - her other mother is particularly creepy. This is a great story about doing the right thing and always be brave, even when you are really scared. Gaiman's writing is beautiful and sometimes Coraline's logical and innocent thoughts reminded me of Diana Wynne Jones. Great book, don't miss this great lesson in life, so simple and yet so good!

0440244870|4.0|Becky's sometimes vapid rationalizations and her overall view of spending habits can be a bit annoying - but overall, I really enjoyed this book.  I saw the movie first and enjoyed the differences in the book and movie.  Becky seemed like a more desperate character throughout the book but I enjoyed watching her unravel through a series of bad decisions and bad advice given. I would recommend that if you've seen the film version, you don't expect the book to go right down the same story. A lot was changed and I was warned before hand not to expect that, so I will pass along the same advice.<br /><br />This is a fun and quick read for anyone who just wants to sit down, have a glass of wine, and read away.  Not all books require a \\"deep meaning\\" or some twisting subplot. Sometimes, just cracking up while reading a book is a good thing and Confessions has a flawed, but likeable character, and some witty dialogue which makes it a great read.

B000BYACOY|5.0|This GDM release is about as close to definitive as you're going to get for Once Upon A Time in the West. It is not 100% complete omitting some shorter passages and alternative takes of the Frank theme as well as including some material that isn't in the international version at least (we get the original version of the McBain family massacre here, much of which was tracked over with \\"Man With the Harmonica\\" in the final film). Furthermore, despite being advertised, not all of this new material exists in stereo although its significantly more than GDM's releases of the Dollars trilogy soundtracks (which were only stereo for the album tracks).<br /><br />That said, this is the one you want. The remastering is terrific, easily topping RCA's many international releases which often sounded shrill and harsh (the 1989 CD in particular). Its a shame Sony/Legacy hasn't gotten their act together and brought this version to the states but even as an import its surprisingly affordable.

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This is a great album.<br /><br />I used to think Minutes to Midnight was their best, but Living Things is hands down better. I'm okay with the pre-Minutes to Midnight stuff, but I really thought Linkin Park hit a good balance with that album. I wasn't as into A Thousand Suns, I thought they went too far in the mellow direction.<br /><br />But Living Things pulls out all the stops. It's got a wide range of sounds, but it really holds together all the way through. It's high energy for the most part, though it's not all guitars and screaming. It's got that but moderated so it has more impact by other sort of mellow, but still intense songs.<br /><br />I can't recommend it enough. If you thought they wussed out or something with the previous two albums, give this one a shot. If you liked the previous two albums, you will definitely like this one. A pretty awesome, solid album.<br /><br />Thanks! Hope this is helpful!

B000FCKGPC|2.0|This series has become increasingly disappointing.  I always have respect for an author who can kill main characters, however this is ridiculous.  There is almost no one left to care about.  All the \\"good guys\\" are basically dead or lost or engaging in questionable moral activity.  I think George R.R. Martin is a sex starved & cynical man.  I'm not sure I'm going to be able to finish this series.  Why bother?  Also, I'm going to punch the next person who compares him to Tolkien.

B008B1VYP0|4.0|I listened to this album on repeat for 2 weeks.  I loved \\"Songs about Jane\\" and while you would be comparing apples and oranges while talking about the two albums, they are similar in the stories the songs tell.  The songs are about love and heartache and the heart break and all the darkness inbetween.

B007ZBWJXI|2.0|Very disappointing, only one good song on this album, (the song Reno), and that is even listed as just a bonus track.  Omega was a very good album and had 7 good songs.  Even Phoenix had two good songs, plus a couple other decent ones.  XXX has very, very weak lyric writing.  And I don't mean the lame 20th Century attempt at Christian Rock in the songs No Religion and Judas.  I mean overall, the lyrics are very weak on this album.  Even the best song Reno is a very trite subject (I mean, c'mon, a song about a casino?).  Reno could use a re-write using the same melody and chorus line.  One good thing about the album is the the drums are closer to the fore than on the previous two albums.  Well, here's hoping for better next time around.

0393080269|5.0|This was an excellent read. Mindful of being accessible to the general reader the author doesn't fail in providing profound and well argued analysis for the next set of successful candidate countries. He also lucidly illustrates why the fashion trend attached to the BRICS is poor and naive. An author who can project so astutely 12 months ago and see so much of what he has identified start to be realized is indeed worthy of recognition. Here Sharma does not fail. The identification of the next breakout countries as Indonesia, Turkey, Poland & the Czech Rep. To mention a few is key. That he also introduces a relativistic aspect almost like Einstein meeting Newton when he captures the various GDP/Capita in $ bands ie at 5000, 10000, 15000 etc and how growth becomes more and more difficult at higher levels and the necessary policy mixes a country should be taking to cross those barriers to continue its ascendancy as well as recognizing that the field is an interactive one where performance is also a function of the performances of those around you and their own relative success and capabilities. (Clearly an issue for china as their are really only so many people who require their products at that cost...success born off cheap labour is going to be impacted by the next cheap labour source...<br /><br />I look forward to further analysis on the changing face of the first world \\"premium countries\\" and those which are slipping back and those which are still accelerating forward ...its almost a designer sequel.

0345802934|5.0|1Q84 is science fiction without science and, at the same time, fantasy without magic. From the outset, the lives of Aomame and Tengo could not be more different. Yet over the course of just one year, Murakami weaves a story that brings these two together into the jaws of destiny. Along the way, there is a menagerie of items, including, the little people, an air chrysalis, a gay lethal bodyguard, a bizarre religious cult, a dyslexic teenager, a malformed private investigator, and two security men who are a cross between the duo from pulp fiction and bob and ted from their excellent adventure.<br /><br />This is more a story than a novel and Murakami is a master storyteller. The tale itself is engaging, compelling, and slowly builds into complexity. The passages are literary word candy. All the main characters are extremely introspective and insightful. For much of the tale, there is a voyeuristic aspect to the revealing of intimate details of the characters.<br /><br />Aomame and Tengo find themselves in some type of alternate universe disturbingly familiar, but with two moons. In the end, they must learn to create their own world in order to find peace and stay with each other.

0670022411|3.0|I was so disappointed after the glowing reviews -- I do think the factual history is interesting but I can't get past the patronizing treatment of the female protagonist who is supposed to be perhaps the most powerful witch in literally ages, but who is lead around, cosseted, protected, tucked into bed, placed on the couch, carried upstairs, piloted around by the -- of course -- tall, dark, handsome, rich, manly vampire -- rather like one of those little dogs you see being carried around by their owners.  She is apparently a chld.  I am only on page 240 though, so maybe she grows up.  UPDATE:  OK, like magic(!) several pages later she started to assert herself and I feel better.

1613821395|5.0|A pure novel from the 19th century, right in the middle of Dickens' era and yet so much more dynamic than Dickens' stories that are systematically slowed down by long descriptions that bring nothing to the plot or the story itself. Here none of those boring descriptive digressions.<br /><br />The story is a long story but the novel sticks to the story and never gets astray. It is told from the point of view of various characters, which gives to the story telling a variety it might not have had otherwise. That diversity enables us to go through that long story without getting lost in attention or translation. In other words it is tremendously modern.<br /><br />The story cannot be told really without deflowering it, so I will only make one comment on it. It is a story about women and the slow change that occurred in the middle of the 19th century under Queen Victoria. This feminine touch, this feminist touch can be seen at various levels.<br /><br />First it clearly shows the social segregation that touches women: women of the higher or upper class (no matter how little that higher or upper class may be) cannot in any way love or marry under their position. It is a question D.H. Lawrence will illustrate very well in his \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\". But here there is a slight evolution towards an exception. And the higher or upper class is shown as particularly anti-women even to the point of being over-courteous or over-attentionate with them. Too much sugar ruins the pie, obviously.<br /><br />Second it clearly shows how swift and intelligent a woman can be when she is kept by nature in the position of not being a belle, a desirable woman. In fact the book pushes the point a little too far with providing that woman with a male face on a female body. She will of course not marry. Why should she since she is more than plain. But she is intelligent, resistant, resilient and she has many other qualities that are hinted at as being masculine, though it is not always a hint. If the woman is beautiful, and there are two in the novel, either she will be a merchandise to be traded in a monetary marriage, or she will be classified dangerous, lunatic and she will be locked up in an Asylum.<br /><br />On the other hand a handsome man from the higher or upper class can seduce all the women he wants, and since he is limited in his advances with women from his own class, he finds no limits with the lower and working classes. That's what can be called fair equality for the sexes. If such a woman from the lower or working classes finds herself pregnant, she better finds a husband that will cover up the disreputable mistake, which is though no mistake of the woman at all but the exploitation of tat woman by some aristocrat.<br /><br />Third when a woman is victimized by her husband she has no way to appeal, to defend herself, to ask for help from lawyers and justice. She has to submit, be obedient and patient. That is so powerfully expressed that it becomes obsessional and such a victimized woman can only be helped by other women. One exception: one man who helps a \\"lunatic\\" woman to escape and an upper class woman to love.<br /><br />This book is thus a perfect depicting of the Victorian society of the 19th century at that tender moment when it starts moving on essential questions, particularly that of women.<br /><br />What's more then the book is a thriller in a way, the story of a crime and the solving of the case with a lot of suspense. It reminds us of the Bronte sisters and their dark novels. In one last word then it is a novel written by a woman and it fairly represents the important feminine literature of the 19th century, a feminine literature that is often eclipsed by Dickens.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU. If the woman is beautiful, and there are two in the novel, either she will be a merchandise to be traded in a monetary marriage, or she will be classified dangerous, lunatic and she will be locked up in an Asylum.<br /><br />On the other hand a handsome man from the higher or upper class can seduce all the women he wants, and since he is limited in his advances with women from his own class, he finds no limits with the lower and working classes. That's what can be called fair equality for the sexes. If such a woman from the lower or working classes finds herself pregnant, she better finds a husband that will cover up the disreputable mistake, which is though no mistake of the woman at all but the exploitation of tat woman by some aristocrat.<br /><br />Third when a woman is victimized by her husband she has no way to appeal, to defend herself, to ask for help from lawyers and justice. She has to submit, be obedient and patient. That is so powerfully expressed that it becomes obsessional and such a victimized woman can only be helped by other women. One exception: one man who helps a \\"lunatic\\" woman to escape and an upper class woman to love.<br /><br />This book is thus a perfect depicting of the Victorian society of the 19th century at that tender moment when it starts moving on essential questions, particularly that of women.<br /><br />What's more then the book is a thriller in a way, the story of a crime and the solving of the case with a lot of suspense. It reminds us of the Bronte sisters and their dark novels. In one last word then it is a novel written by a woman and it fairly represents the important feminine literature of the 19th century, a feminine literature that is often eclipsed by Dickens.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0606259090|1.0|I, like most people on here I'm assuming, went to read the book out of curiosity since it was being talked about so much. Luckily I didn't spend any money on it and used a friends account to read it online. OH man, I cannot get past the 7th chapter. I give up. Horrible writing, horrible storyline, horrible characters...everything just seems so fake! And I know it's supposed to be fiction, obviously, like most books are, but at least in other books I'm able to lose myself and feel a part of the story, whereas with this.. it was garbage. Reading through the other reviews of people mentioning how the sex scenes all become the same, how she has all the same expressions, words, descriptions, etc. I agree! The sex scenes are just horrible too. They feel so out of place and fake and just... weird! I am an avid reader, I love reading and love losing myself in a good book and always finish whatever I start but I can't be bothered to waste my time on this..I don't want to dumb myself down. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE PEOPLE.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|For me, it was the Candy Apple Red '62 Chevy 327 convertable and girls with 'bouffant' hair, at Ted's Hot Dog Stand in Front Park. If you can relate to any of this, you're gonna love this album. I can't imagine a better 50th anniversary music set for The Beach Boys, than what is recorded on, That's Why God Made The Radio. It exemplifies the very essence of summer in the 1960's for an entire generation. It just wouldn't have been summer without The Beach Boys. This music is so good, I'd suggest a recording wrap up for 'The Boys'...rather than a follow-up that might disappoint. It's THAT good. Perhaps instead, they might want to  start working on a book...I wonder how Brian Wilson will manage to write those beautifully smooth harmonies into a book!
0553386794|2.0|1) I can't see how this classifies as \\"fantasy\\" since there exists no magic or supernatural aspects except in deep corners of the book; nothing like a main aspect like in LOTR or Dune or Harry Potter where magic and supernatural are a huge part of the story. If anything, this is just medieval fiction. The ONLY thing \\"fantasy\\" in this book is dragons and they're extinct. There are some creatures called the Others, but they exist beyond a wall and, surprise surprise, NO ONE GOES THERE! So 90% of the book is in this mock medieval world/timeline...how is that fantasy?<br /><br />2) Too many characters. It's easy to keep track of the main characters but all of the other characters get lost and you have to keep figuring out who everyone is. And for many characters, like Sansa, who cares about her and what she thinks? She serves no purpose, than after a certain event (no spoilers) Joffrey just beats her around; why do i want to read about a minor character of no importance to the story? Space waster.<br /><br />3) Too slow of pace. I'm 350 pages in and very little has happened. A kid got attacked, and almost attacked a second time...that's it. One could argue that the story is drawn on to seem realistic in regards to say Ned Stark's investigation about his kid and the death of Jon Arryn, but with the viewpoints and stories of other characters included (often not relative to the investigation) it makes the story really, really, long and slow. People don't read books for the realistic timeline, they read for entertainment; why do you think shows like CSI solve ALL crimes in an hour? Because no one would watch if they treated cases realistically that sometimes go for months, years, or are never solved.<br /><br />4) One of my biggest peeves with \\"Girl with the dragon tattoo\\" was that there were two story lines that took forever to merge (Mikael's and Salanders). In Game of Thrones this story line of Dany and the Dothraki keeps popping up that apparently is on a totally different continent than the rest of the book; yet only once in the 350 pages I've read has there been any hint of the Dothraki story line merging with the rest of the book: one character worries about Dany Taergaryan getting an arming and marching for the thrown....but oh wait, the Dothraki hate water and have no boats  so let's not worry about them. Book continues with two separate non-merging story lines. Keeping track of all the characters and story lines until some big merge of all of them is too much work. I don't want to see how the pizza is made, i just want to eat it.<br /><br />5) GRR Martin is a creepy old man. Ned Stark and his wife are the only people who have normal, happy, in-love/care about the other person sex. The rest of the sex in the book is widely disturbing: Rape, Incest, Prostitution/sex slavery, and underage sex (Dany is only 13. AND somehow after the first time becomes an instant pro at it; yeah, that's realistic just like the breasts of every woman in video games). The \\"excuse\\" i hear from so many is \\"it's accurate for the time period\\"...wait, is Martin writing historical fiction or fantasy? LOTR was set in a similar time period and isn't full of rape, incest, prostitution/sex slavery, and underage sex...so what's the deal?<br /><br />I kept hearing that Game of Thrones was so awesome and i saw the 1st book for like $9 so i thought \\"why not\\"...perhaps it's just my anti-conformist but this book is overrated. My rule is that if a book doesn't grab me 100 pages i stop reading. I went to 350 only because the book is so big (didn't see how many pages total) and it's a serious let downent continent than the rest of the book; yet only once in the 350 pages I've read has there been any hint of the Dothraki story line merging with the rest of the book: one character worries about Dany Taergaryan getting an arming and marching for the thrown....but oh wait, the Dothraki hate water and have no boats  so let's not worry about them.

B005RUV0NY|5.0|This season was amazing! My husband and I loved watching this season! After watching season one on Hulu, we<br />had to search for the second season.

0743486285|5.0|I have never really been a fan of M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e. In fact I always thought that Nikki Sixx was a girl. Sad I know, but I had grown away from that type of music when I turned 13. Anyway, a friend of mine got me a copy of this book because I am studying to become a psychologist to help people with addictions. I recently wrote a paper inspired by Layne Staley for my comp 2 course. It was about heroin and the effects it has on the brain. Not that anyone cares, but I got an A on it. My friend figured that I would enjoy reading this book because of my passion for heroin addiction and recovery. I was a bit skeptical at first and put off. I figured, what do I have to lose? If it sucks then I can let it gather dust on the shelf with other books.<br /><br />I began reading and was instantly hooked. It was very cleverly written. I enjoyed the commentaries after the entries. It was refreshing to hear actual accounts and emotions that he experienced while using. The way he writes in his journal is a lot like the way I do. I related to his words. It shows powerful emotions. It shows truth. It shows how heroin can alter perception. It shows how scary heroin can be. Wonderful book! I have gained a new respect for Nikki! Congrats to him for getting clean and being able to share his experiences with everyone. That takes real courage. I still have problems looking my past in the face. I am working on it though.

B007CW2FCA|4.0|These truly Great recordings by Arrau, one of the Greatest Masters of the past century, have stood the test of time and have remained on the \\"Must Have\\" list for more than 40 years, and still continue to be one of the sets that all recordings that have come since these are invariably measured against. Undoubtedly they belong in any serious music lover's collection...period.<br /><br />However, I question Decca's limitation here in this latest release of these works. These recordings were previously released on Philips back in 1998. That release (which I have) was done in 24bit A/D and thus I would caution that more than likely this newer release is merely another release of that same remastering. Where I Really wish to draw your attention is that this previous set was on 14 discs, and it INCLUDED the 5 Concertos*, the Triple Concerto+, and also the Op.51 No. 2 Rondo in G. Thus, I cannot see where anyone would truly wish this current set vs the previous one, wherever possible one could obtain the 462 358-2 edition [[ASIN:B00000C2F7 Beethoven: The Complete Piano Sonatas & Concertos [Box Set]]]. Having just added this product link, I see that the cost is prohibitive, so this may negate any help or advice that I may present here for your benefit regarding this set vs the previous one. Of course, that will need to be your decision which set you choose. Again, I question whether or not the sonics are better on this new set, and the omission of the Concertos and the Rondo....if they were already mastered in 24 bit, and previously released, then WHY does Decca now choose to \\"break these up\\" when they simply could have just done a REISSUE unchanged? Omitting 2 discs, but excising 7 works in the process just does not make sense (but my better judgement says that Decca has plans on ANOTHER box with these other works...which means more $ in their pockets).<br /><br />* Piano Concertos 1-5 /  Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra/Bernard Haitink<br />+ Triple Concerto /  Henryk Szeryng, Violin/Janos Starker, Cello/New Philharmonia Orchestra/Eliahu Inbal<br /><br />OK, all the above being said and pointed out to you, the prospective purchaser of this set, I will still throw my Yeas to these recordings....they DO belong in your collection. They are at the pinnacle of recordings of these greatest of Beethoven's output, unchallenged, even if you have other sets of them. My purpose of this review here is to make you aware that there has been a Much Better release alternative with the previous incarnation above. Regardless of which alternative you choose, I wish you many many years of blissful listening to Claudio Arrau's superb traversal of these cornerstones of the classical genious that Beethoven was.<br /><br />~operabruinViolin/Janos Starker, Cello/New Philharmonia Orchestra/Eliahu Inbal<br /><br />OK, all the above being said and pointed out to you, the prospective purchaser of this set, I will still throw my Yeas to these recordings....they DO belong in your collection.

B000VT6FAO|4.0|Listening to this CD, I was immediately struck by the difference between what Dave has been singing about with DM for the last 20+ years and this CD. Yes he has God/Jesus questions-who doesn't? We're human, that's our job-to question, figure it out and live well till the Big Guy calls our number.<br />What moved me so much was \\"Deeper and Deeper\\". I'm sure some women would be offended and some people would be in the WTF crowd. But the absolute animal passion is what good sex IS; and to capture it in music is do-able (\\"I Feel You\\"-SOFAD), but in words-wow. Not easy without using profanity and graphic descriptions like some of the crap \\"music\\" around today.<br /><br />Dave has spent the last 20+ years singing Martin's words-and Martin was always on his knees,falling on the floor again waiting and begging to be touched. And while watching an old video performance from the 1993 Devotion Tour of \\"In Your Room\\", I could feel Dave was just not into the whole \\"slave\\" thing. I then watched every clip I could find of him performing that song-any year, any place-and there was just something missing. While watching him perform \\"The Dead of Night\\" from The Excitor Tour, another dominant-though sleazy-male song, which ANY woman who has been to a bar with or without a Zombie Room, can completely relate to- I noticed how MUCH he enjoyed doing that song-he loved it!<br /><br /> When I heard \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", especially the line about liking a woman who\\" puts up a fight\\", I remembered an old interview with him telling a story about trying to beat up a cabby who pissed him off (YEARS ago) when he first came here, and he said that he needs to get in a \\"scrap\\" every once in a while. It's an urge he has to control. I realized Dave ain't no \\"bottom\\" waiting around for some woman to tell him what to do; that song as dark as it is, is part of him.Maybe he was that extreme in his past, or just did it yesterday-who knows? But it's about time a man sings about being a man. While there are men who like women to dominate them, there are women who like men to be the dominate one; some would call him a \\"brute\\", but why is it alright for a man to grab what he wants in life, but not \\"take\\" his woman?<br /><br />A difficult subject in this PC Society and I applaud him for being pushy-and honest.<br /><br />The dominance is not just in the lyrics, but can be felt in every single note in that song; it is a perfect piece of music.<br />\\"I'm gonna have you when I want to, I'm gonna take you that's what I like\\"-so says Dave-and the bass and the drums and the lead guitar and the Apple computers.....it's \\"I Want You Now\\" on crack and steroids, testosterone to be exact.<br /><br />Maybe it's just a coincidence, but when iTunes put \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" into my playlist, it was placed right after David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\". So what you say- well that was the song Dave Gahan was singing when Martin and the rest \\"discovered\\" him.Hmmm. Could be Kismet -or could be God/Jesus winking at me by giving the thumbs up to those He has decided to \\"touch\\"-just so I can sing and dance to their glorious music while I question and figure out what the heck I'm doing here.

0375703764|5.0|Every time I read this book, I have to keep looking at the cover to remind myself it's a novel. In that way, it does to the reader what happens to the narrator- the reverse of what happens to the characters in the inner frame tale: they encounter something real that they cannot take as reality. We encounter something clearly fictional, that somehow seems real. I've never found a checkmark on the bottom of a page so terrifying.<br /><br />The book is experimental fiction at its most perfectly executed. Even the \\"editor\\" of the book is a narrative character. The number of characters who need their own voice and style (even as narrators), the amount of invented source material, the graphic layouts and images, it's all simply masterful.<br /><br />Any time I open it I have to be ok with not being able to focus on anything else for a few days! And I usually have to keep the lights on.<br /><br />Not for nothing, I now have the full, re-mastered, full-color edition, and it was totally worth the investment of buying a second copy.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Ok, I will start this by saying I am an Asia fan.  Been since 1982 and followed every incarnation of the band.  I'm not a 70's holdover still whining they dont do \\"progressive\\" pieces that are 12 mintues long.  I'm not a spurned John Payne fan that felt he was done wrong.  I am a fan and I like what they do, and I want the best musicians that want to be in Asia and create this music and that is the original 4 members.<br /><br />The album here is their best work since Alpha and it's on par with that.  Nothing will ever top the debut.  They have now been together for 6 years since they reformed and each offering is getting better.  XXX is very very good from beginning to end.  It's starts with a bang and flows nicely.  The best songs in my opinion are Tomorrow The World, Bury Me in Willow, Faithful and the first single Face on the Bridge.  That isnt to say the others aren't great.  In fact since i've had this i play it straight through every time.  There is some stellar guitar work on the album from Steve Howe, Geoff Downes is at the forefront, and thats what this band is based on frankly, while there is some good work by Carl here as well.  My only complaint is that it seems kind of buried and you have to listen for it.  John Wetton as usual sounds great, for the age that he is as well which is quite impressive.  Lyricly i think there are some really interesting messages throughout, most notable on Tomorrow the World and Bury Me in Willow.<br /><br />So again, if you are looking for the 15 minute epic, this isnt for you and ASIA has never been that band - why people are still waiting for that i will never know.  And guess what the 4 guys in this band dont want to do that.  If you are a John Payne supporter he's not here.  And honestly i want to compare the 2 ASIAs (i still have a hard time believing there are 2) but he hasn't done squat in the years since the original reformed.  So there is nothing to compare.<br /><br />So what you have here, is what you had in 1982.  4 people who create great Art rock, Progressive pop, whatever - but what it is, is enjoyable and it's done very very well, time and time again.  They are touring this fall - and they are amazing live as well.

It's exciting from page to page, something new a different with every finger turn. I must admit this book should be read in the confinement of your private home because of the \\"physical effect\\" it will have on your sex . I would recommend this book to 18 and up due to the raunchy and racy sex scenes that pop up. I give this book two erect thumbs up!
0307165485|5.0|Great story book. This book has a mix of whole page drawings that focus on one topic(colors for example), pages with multiple objects (planes, cars, foods), detailed diagrams (houses) very short stories (multiple pages with a picture and a couple of lines of text per page), short fairy tales, and loner stories. Because of this, it manages to stay fresh and sections that were of no interest start to become favorites as the get more accessible with age. This was a favorite for when we first got it, and now my daughter is constantly bringing to us, definitely a great purchase.

0553801473|2.0|Plenty of reviews here with the same sentiment, but I'll chip in my two bits.<br /><br />Martin got three solid books out of this series...then it went off the rails with \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" continues the train wreck.  I think his honesty to the story is getting in the way.  It is like no character can *ever* achieve their basic goal (or any goal for that matter).  Tragedy always ensues which sends the story in yet another new direction (complete with 1000 new irrelevant characters). It's impossible to fall in love with any of the characters.<br /><br />Too many new characters, too much useless traveling, constant soul-searching by various characters, and way too much descriptive prose (I don't know why he has to go into 3 paragraph details about a simple meal, or describe in excruciating detail the 4,000th coat of arms of some character that you will never hear from again) - it all grinds the story to a halt.<br /><br />Personally, I'm going to skip the next book and MAYBE pick up the 7th, as I do have an interest in what happened to (what's left) of the original characters.<br /><br />Damn shame - Martin really had something good going on there for a while.

0385040253|2.0|If you are looking for a book with a ton of knots, what are they used for, and their names, this is for you. But if you are looking to learn how actually to tie some knots better look somewhere. I can difficulty count more than 15 knots that you can actually manage to decifrate how to do them. It's not that is difficult to understand, its just that it doesn't explains at all.<br />Remember, as a reference book is excellent. But is not a guide for making knots (in the cover it says so, but trust me it isn't).
B005PK1G76|5.0|I just got this on Amazon for 6.99 plus free shipping since I have Amazon Prime and I love it! I have never written a review before, but I thought people would want to know that you don't need to pay $30 for the Britax stroller organizer! As far as I can tell it fits any size cup or bottle (I tried a regular water bottle, a travel coffee cup, and a big slushy cup from the convenience store). There are two cup holders with a space in between perfect to put your cell phone, as well as a little zippered compartment for keys and a credit card/cash. So glad I found this!
B004XUMPFQ|1.0|I feel that I missed out on this series back when it originally aired, but I refuse to pay $31.99 for just the first season.  For an old series, that price out to get you the full run and then some.<br /><br />*My rating is for the Instant Video Product offered, not the show itself.<br /><br />>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />!!! Fanboys Unite !!!  You can attack me all you want but the Amazon rating system applies just as much to the product offered as it does to the original Movie/TV Show/Book/Whatever. I made it perfectly clear in my initial review that I was not dissing the show (which I, admittedly, had not seen).  I was criticizing the product offered for sale.  Goods damaged upon arrival, goods arriving much later than estimated, incorrect items delivered, Instant Videos that cannot be viewed due to server-side technical complications ... these are all valid reasons to give something a poor review.  Every movie or book purchased is subject to criticism of Amazon itself as well as the author, manufacturer or movie producer.  If you just want to rate a film or TV show then don't come to Amazon.  Go to the IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster.  Don't come here and harass people like me.<br /><br />I have since purchased the the DVD along with the DVD for 'Serenity'.  I have yet to watch the movie but I have watched the series.  I enjoyed it.  However, one defamatory critic who claimed, \\"You won't ever find a more entertaining, absorbing way to spend your cash\\" was exemplary of all you fanboys.  I've been around the block a few times and I am a pretty good judge of how to spend my money.  The show was enjoyable, but I am sure that the hundreds I have spent for the opera next season will be better spent despite being so much more money.  Maybe you fanboys need to get out more.  Find a girlfriend, boyfriend ... something.
B008EQIJQO|3.0|My wife and I streamed this movie with great anticipation.  After all, it won best picture so it had to be great, right?  Wrong.  Yes, it was interesting and creative, and certainly something we haven't seen in a modern-day movie before.  But it was also boring, depressing, and felt like something a UCLA film student could have created.  Best Picture candidate - no.  Best Picture winner - no way.  Would I watch it again - not a chance.  And that is the measure of a great movie, will it stand the test of time and be watched again and again.  This movie will be forgotten in a year.  You'll see it in the Walmart $5 bin next year.  Disappointed!

B007Q476KU|1.0|I don't even know where to start.  This movie was awful in so many ways, its only redeeming value was the cinematography.  The storyline, acting, plot, and war scenes were so appallingly bad that I can't get over how this movie received a majority of favorable reviews.  It was so over-the-top cheezy that I don't think I will watch another Disney flick for a long, long time.<br /><br />The film lost me early on when the Dad was forced to sell the horse to the army.  The son was expectedly upset so the lieutenant told the boy he would personally take care of the horse and treat it like family.  Oh boy!  If that wasn't bad enough, the lieutenant wrote a letter to the boy to tell him how the horse was doing.  Keep in mind, this wasn't a 10 year old boy.  He looked to be 18.  Even worse was the so-called war scene where the allies and germans were fighting from opposite bunkers.  They all took a moment out so an Ally and a German could meet in the middle and cut the horse loose from barbed wire.  Gag.  This was so implausible a story that I had to write a review.  I understand one has to suspend belief in some movies, but the acting was so bad I couldn't let go.  Worst movie I have seen in a few years.  Oh yeah, one more thing, my wife liked it.  Gag.

B008B3H4VQ|3.0|This album is made up of 3 good songs with the rest feeling like filler. The opening 3 tracks are great, after that it is all downhill. The beats and sounds feel recycled and the few parts with screams just feel completely out of place because of the beats that surround them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it. Its fun and hard and also addictive. I recommend it to everyone. My family and I play this all the time.
B000JQU4TW|3.0|I read this book because it was a bookclub read. I aways wanted to read this book, and glad that I did, but it was a little bit of struggle at times not to set it down and forget about it. I don't know why but it never seemed to catch my full attention like it did with other people, and I found the story to be slow in spots. I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics.
B002FU42NE|1.0|i can't downlonded the soundtrack or the songs at i like to downlond from amazon what then they have it up for downlond but i can't downlond the song's at i like and that sucks
0316044695|5.0|I gave this book to my son and asked that he share it with our grandkids when they were old enough to understand this sorry world a little better. All of us should thank God each day that there are such men out there like Marcus, willing to do what they do for our sake. As a retired vet I want to thank Marcus Luttrell for keeping alive the American warrior spirit and never quitting when the going got tough. Great book by a great man.
0606259090|4.0|I really like this love novel is based on a Literature college student who does a favor for a friend and finds the man of her dreams! On this interview she is amazed at how handsome Mr. Christian Grey is. However, Anastasia Steele didn't realize that her life was going to change for the good and bad. This book is very sexual explicit and only for adult only. This book is in the family with Zane and others. But this book keeps you captive, there's not a dull moments in this book, very interesting, and keeps you on the edge but you just cannot put the book down. This novel has three series so just imagine how captivating these novel's will be, and keep you wanting more. However, this is E.L. James first and not the last novels. I can give her four stars for the amazing novels.<br />--Crysteal Jenkins--Fifty shades of Grey
0439023513|1.0|A total tagent from the other two books, and not a good one. I don't understand what Collins feels like she's achieving by killing off more than half of her characters - and in ways were hardly explained. Did not like this one bit, and am sickened that I even bought it.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is about a population that is run completely by the Capital. The population has been broken down into twelve districts. After district thirteen tried to rebel against the capital, they destroyed the district. To make sure no other district tries to rebel, every year they hold the \\"Hunger Games\\" which they select one boy and one girl from each district to fight to their deaths. When Katniss' little sister is chosen as tribute, she volunteers to save her sister. When she volunteers, she is paired with a boy who saved her life long ago. In order to survive, Katniss has to make drastic decisions, which will make this year's game unforgettable.<br /><br />From what I have seen, this book is loved by all types of audiences; young children, teens, and adults. I did not enjoy this book myself. I found it hard to get sucked into this book. I felt as though it moved slowly, and I need to be captured within the first couple of chapters. The story was interesting, but it wasn't one of those books you put down and say \\"Wow, that was awesome.\\" I enjoy romance books such as the Twilight Series, but the question of whether or not Katniss and Peetra love each other got old really quick for me. I feel it was extremely overplayed which caused me to get slightly annoyed with the book. I would recommend this book for people that are more patient with books and enjoy action and romance.<br /><br />Samantha B
0439023491|2.0|The writing was weak, and really just an extension to \\"The Hunger Games\\". Suzanne Collins had one good idea - the premise of \\"The Hunger Games\\". I am at a loss as to why she had to send her characters back into the arena. There was no point. Really, just an irritating, disappointing, continuation of the series.
030758836X|4.0|The Missing Wife<br />\\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn is a very intense book. It keeps you guessing until the very end. It has a little bit of everything in it: romance, mistresses, lies, and deep secrets. I really enjoyed this book. It was a bit long but overall good. It's an easy read and you become engrossed in the book. Although there is adult content and language I could not picture the book without the descriptive scenes. Nick Dunne 34 and his wife Amy Elliott 38 they have been married for five years. Amy is a very successful Author writing her books \\"Amazing Amy\\".  Nick is also a writer, but he was laid off after eleven years of being a writer. Soon after Nick lost his job Amy lost her job too. When Nick's parents became ill they moved from New York to Nick's hometown in Missouri. With the stress of losing their job's and moving to a completely other state lines will be crossed and buttons will be pushed. They bring out the worst in each other and on their fifth anniversary Amy goes missing. The police find signs of struggle and blood in Nick and Amy's apartment. As the police try to piece everything together clues are pointing at Nick because he lied about almost everything in the interview, and it makes you wonder what does Nick have to lie about if he wants his wife back. Throughout the book there are a series of journal entries from Amy explaining everything that's going on in her head. Does she still love Nick? Was she unhappy in her marriage did she not want to move and leave her family behind? Over this entire book keeps you on your toes and keeps you wanting to read more.
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|The story sounded good and had definitely potential, unfortunately nobody made something out of it. The movie started out alright, but turned, thanks to a very obnoxious kid with brat behavior in a drag of a movie. I could not stand that kid, he was just too much in his attitude, manners and behavior. Also there was literally no editing done with this movie. There were scenes that didn't really add anything to the movie but just dragged on and on.<br />I expected way more of that movie but was very disappointed. Waste of time.
B007WFTFG6|2.0|Really?  The free trial has ads that are too easy to accidently click.  Singles ads... geez! Very hard to stay in the lines so may cause some frustration...
B0026S1XDM|2.0|Ok Mike & Co. please stop selling the same stuff all over.  I have the original Tubular Bells, then I bought the 25th anniversary remastered gold edition.  Then you offered this telling us that you wanted to remake your opera with the latest technology, later you made \\"Deluxe Edition\\" from the original master tapes.  And I'm not counting the one that I own from \\"Elements\\" compilation or the same on \\"Boxed\\" and the story goes on.<br />One is enough trust me.

B006H8BIIM|5.0|Not sure what everyone is complaining about. I have a lot of fun playing this and didn't have to spend a cent of my own money to beat it. It does get harder quickly, so you have to figure the best way to defend with what you have. want more? Then pay the mining mode.  You are able to earn a lot more credits than the other two side games. I just wish I could get the second item store. It crashes on me when I try. I'll pay $.99 for that!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it. Read this book in about 2 days, once I started didn't want to stop.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Let me say it again...Wow!  Great story and great characters.  This writer deserves more acclaim for his series.  Refreshing and completely new storyline.  I loved every page of every book. The story is compelling and never really lets the reader know what is coming right around the corner.  Tons of plot twists and suprises.  Highly recommended!!
B0086700CM|3.0|Not a bad game at first but is too repetative. New characters are available. but you have no idea what they do.  Makes for an amusing evening or two then move on.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Simply not good enough. Unlike The Killing Floor, this one is slow and boring. Nothing intriguing. No twist at all.
B0086700CM|3.0|I guess since I use it on my kindle the graphics are bound to be slow, but the game is still enjoyable. I give it three stars because it could still be improved for the android devices and maybe perform a little better. Perhaps make it more compatible with Kindle in order to make it better. And additional note would be that whenever I progress further into the game the quality becomes worse (because my kindle cannot keep up with the graphics). Having this game on a phone would probably be better.
0606259090|5.0|This trilogy is amazing.  I loveed it.  I read a lot and I can honestly say I have never in my life been into a book as much as these.  They were exciting and sexual and deep.  There is so much more to these books than sex.  Thank you!  Love these books!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The narrative is nice and tight, the story is believable, the characters are believable.<br />When I had to stop reading to go to work, I wondered how the people in the silo were doing.<br /><br />Just make sure you buy all of the books at once, you will definitely read them all.  Each book is quite short.
0425263908|3.0|same story, differnt setting.  Its a lot more crass than Shades.  Shades were more classy and sexy in my opinion.  This girl is almost low class.  I guess Shades of Grey other one was more a love story and romantic and you knew why he fell for her.  I dopnt get why Gideon likes her or why she is different from other girls.
0307887448|3.0|I really liked the plot and characters. There's really nothing wrong with the book and I had a great time reading it. Definitely recommend.<br /><br />The problem I had with this book is the references are a bit too mainstream. The films and music referenced are all top ten, the most popular back in the day; and most of the time, the quality of a movie of song is inverse to its popularity. I would have given the book the extra star if more obscure material were referenced, which might have resulted in people discovering stuff they weren't previously aware of.<br /><br />While there are plenty of 80s artifacts on display, the overall understanding of that decade appears pretty shallow. Disappointing.

B004LWZW4W|1.0|This movie is such garbage ! Bad CGI, bad acting, plot holes galore ! After being raised by a nurturing human this ape turns against mankind because of a couple of humans were mean to him. I don't buy the character's motivation. The CGI apes look fake and James Franco's acting is horrendous.The Whole movie feels like it was rushed !

B005I6EU7U|5.0|My husband bought me the Kindle Fire for my birthday six months ago, with a basic case to go with it. I lusted after this one for months and finally broke down and bought it. And now I'm OBSESSED. It's even prettier in person, incredibly soft, and looks fantastic. It's sleek and doesn't add much bulk to the device, plus no more hand cramps from trying to hold the Kindle Fire for long periods of time. The Verso case truly mimics the look and feel of reading a real book--and not just any book, but a treasured antique.<br /><br />I'm a true book lover who had a hard time making the transition to an e-reader; this bridges the gap perfectly. Makes me feel like I haven't totally sold out to the digital age! It's sturdy, fits well, and protects my Kindle from smudges and scratches. The cover even folds back for one-handed use. It did require a breaking in period (as described in the product insert) to lay absolutely flat over the Fire, but after a few weeks of use it's now a perfect fit. I like that the elastic straps are black and almost invisible against the Kindle's exterior. I already loved my Kindle, but this really does make me love it even more. I can't wait to pick it up and read.<br /><br />The only drawback to this case is that there is no folding option for watching movies/TV...though if there was, it would ruin the look of the cover. I use the Fire almost exclusively for reading, note-taking and using the internet, so this isn't a major issue for me. It's easy enough to prop up without a built-in mechanism on the occasions when I use it for viewing.<br /><br />BONUS: My house was burglarized recently and EVERYTHING was taken from our bedroom (my husband's iPad, all electronics, etc). We believe the only reason my Kindle Fire survived was because of the Verso cover...since it was sitting on my nightstand and not plugged in, we think the thieves didn't know it wasn't a real book! So for security purposes, we give it 5 stars, too ;)
B0086700CM|3.0|I really do enjoy playing, but sometimes the app lags! If they could fix that so it works better on the kindled I'd be a happy camper! Other than the occasional lag, this is a really great game! &lt;3
0525478817|5.0|Hazel is a teenager diagnosed with terminal cancer. She goes to a cancer support group where she meets a boy named Augustus Waters who will change her forever. Throughout the book, the two grow with each other and find a love both profound and exquisite, even in the shadow of death.<br /><br />You know those stories that leave you numb? The ones that you finish, and then set aside and stare at blank space for a while so that you can process what you had just finished reading? Yeah, this was that kind of book. And the thing was, I was completely blindsided by how great this book was. Okay, so The Fault in Our Stars is a cancer book. Apparently this is a niche genre, because after I finished this book, I read some other reviews that mentioned other \\"cancer books\\" like this one. I would assume that a cancer book had a prerequisite amount of melancholy and suffering, and I typically shy away from those kinds of books. Maybe that's why I found Stars so enchanting, as opposed to some people who disliked it. I'm not familiar with cancer books, so this was new territory for me.<br /><br />Something about Hazel's wry, snappy narration is charming and completely engrossing, and kept me reading long into the night. Hazel does not dwell on her illness. It's a constant, and it's been a part of her life since she was a child, but her sense of humor shines through, and makes the subject of terminal cancer an easier pill to swallow for the reader. I truly did like Hazel as a character. She's self-deprecating and mature for her age, which instantly made me identify with her. I particularly appreciated her relationship with her parents, and how she seems to take on the adult role when it comes to her illness. Green's prose sparkles with life, and he wrote the voice of Hazel so well that I was initially surprised that the book was written by a man, and not a woman.<br /><br />Hazel and her love interest, Augustus, had a unique and interesting relationship, even if I found them a bit contrived. This was the only part in the book that I took issue with. I found that Hazel and Augustus were unusually well-spoken for kids their age. Then again, I was the same at that age, so who am I to play skeptical reader? However, I think that they acted unrealistically old and adult, when they're supposed to be seventeen. That took me out of the story a bit, because even though they looked and seemed like teens, Hazel and Augustus had the dynamic of two adults. I think that Mr. Green needs to learn how to truly emulate the voice of a young person, rather than using them as a mouthpiece for his own thoughts.<br /><br />I found the love story a bit forced. A teen cancer patient (who strongly resembles Natalie Portman &agrave; la V for Vendetta, as is repeatedly mentioned throughout the book, as if the reader will forget how attractive Hazel is even when she's sick and fighting cancer) happens to run into an equally, if not more so, gorgeous boy who is in remission and is decidedly articulate for a teenage boy... it all felt a little too neatly set up to be truly believable. However, as their relationship evolved and I got to see a more three-dimensional Augustus, I really started to like the two of them together and ultimately fell in love with their love.<br /><br />I found myself completely enchanted by the plot, in which Hazel, with the help of Augustus, seeks to speak to the author of a book that changed her life. By book's end, I found myself really caring about the characters, and despite knowing what I signed myself up for, the ending of the book was an emotional sucker punch to the gut. I knew with this kind of book that something was going to happen, but that didn't make it any easier to handle. The Fault in Our Stars left me emotionally drained, but uplifted. I can see why Green has such a cult following online... his writing is full of heart and soul.ontrived. This was the only part in the book that I took issue with.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|[[ASIN:B0050CJNJ2 Own The Night]  I thought Lady Antebellum was like Lady Gaga until I saw them as guest musicians on The Voice.  Their tight harmonies and flawless voices drew me in and as the lyrics to the song unfolded, I was spellbound.  And they are a country music group?!  Apparently, C&W has evolved quite a bit.  Best of all, I ended up liking other cuts on the album as well, and some better than, the song for which I originally purchased the CD.  Enjoy!

030758836X|5.0|Wow. I didn't intend to read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl when I did. Two other books sat on the top of the reading pile, begging for a thorough read, the Amazon reader review thing, and so on. But one dark day, I needed a book with an edge to it, and having peeked at a sample page of Gone Girl already, I knew where to find that edge.<br /><br />Gone Girl is the story of Nick and Amy, a seemingly perfect couple to anyone looking in from the outside. But at the start of the book, on the couple's fifth anniversary, when Nick comes home to a ransacked living room and a missing wife, the marriage has already deteriorated to a far from perfect state. Talk about your love hate relationship. Nick and Amy have one in spades at this point - mostly hate, but with love so excruciatingly painted around the edges you can't imagine a better combination.<br /><br />Nick's clumsy handling of himself during the police investigation and an accumulating, increasingly-damning pile of evidence soon point the finger at him as the murderer. We, the readers, don't know whether he is one or not, even though we've been reading most passages from his first person point of view.<br /><br />So is he or isn't he? I won't spoil it. Let me instead touch on two compelling aspects of this novel. First, Gillian's voice is one that many writers would kill for (bad pun, I know). Through the first half of the book she alternates her passages from Nick's point of view (written in a Jess Walter voice, and you never think for one second that hmmm this is a woman trying to write from a man's POV), and Amy's point of view as found in diary entries written before the climactic murder or abduction or whatever actually happened (because I still refuse to tell). Amy's voice is much different than Nick's and I love that. She's brilliant and has a fascinating perceptiveness about each of those many people who just can't help but revolve around her irresistible gravitational force.<br /><br />The other can't-put-it-down aspect of this novel is the quick pacing both before and after a sudden switch in plot halfway through. By that point, as a reader, you think you know the whole story and how it will all end, and you can't imagine what the second half of the book will be for.  Why isn't this a novella? What's coming next?<br /><br />What's coming next is motive, and true circumstances, plans going awry, plans being reshaped, and a remarkable elevation of compromise to an art form.<br /><br />I loved this book.<br /><br />Joe
B007L3BMGA|5.0|this is amazing book. starts a bit slow but then you get to like the 3rd chapter and wont be able to put it down for the rest of the trilogy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|excellent time waster. You should read the instructions under help so you are not disillusioned about the game. Also it says 125 games;you start with 10 and can earn the rest.
1442419814|4.0|I don't give you the plot because...well its a simple plot and I rather give you an impression...an inclination<br /><br />The Series of The Uglies- Book 1- Uglies<br /><br />Despite the gaping holes in the plot and loose interplay with minor and major figures I do like the first book. Its a breeze to read. Give yourself a week if you are busy. Intriguing and banal at the same time. The tension is bound up in this trans-formative surgery when you turn 16 years old. Everybody becomes pretty because it eases social tensions and levels the playing field.<br />Conceptually, the contrast between Tally and Shay at the end really play up the brain lesions in the frontal lobe. I'm intrigued by the problem of finding a cure (pills made in a hollow building with NOTHING to make them is questionable, but...I like the ideas in the series.) So, I'll buy the next book. I am not rushing for it, but I recommend buy the box set.
B002UM5BXW|2.0|I am a big fan of Tony's No Reservations TV series and had noticed this book on several occasions while browsing the Kindle store. I finally decided to give it a whirl after reading some positive reviews. While the book does have its funny moments, they are far and few between. Tony spends most of the book telling you what an abject failure he was early on his life. After reading this book, its amazing to me that he was able to ever get himself together in order to hold down a job, let alone a emmy winning tv series! I ended up skimming through the second half of the book as it could barely hold my interest. Pass on this book if your a fan of Tony in his current form, on No Reservations.

0553103547|4.0|An enthralling, epic tale set in a place reminiscent of medieval Europe, Britain, and beyond.  Many different storylines are interwoven to create a fascinating and complete world filled with treachery, deceit, and intrigue.  There is also love and honor, particularly in the person of Lord Eddard Stark, who is called by his land's king, Robert Baratheon, to leave his home behind and act as the King's Hand (in other words, his right-hand man).  He tries valiantly to serve the king, while maintaining his integrity.  This proves to be nigh impossible, since every man and woman has an agenda, and he knows next to no-one, save the king himself.<br /><br />Cersei, the queen, is from the rich and powerful House of Lannister, and she has her own plans for the running of the kingdom.  She loves not the king, but is quite fond of her brother, Jamie, who stays quite snugly by her side.  She is grooming her young and spoiled son, Joffrey, to take the throne should some misfortune befall her drunken lout of a husband.  As soon as the boy enters the scene, it is easy to see that he would not be a kinder, gentler ruler. 'Tis best to hope for a long and hearty life for the current lord of the realm.<br /><br />The twin brother to Jamie Lannister, Tyrion is my favorite character by far.  Called the Imp, due to his dwarfism, Tyrion is at the bottom of the food chain amongst the illustrious Lannister clan.  While others in his family are tall, fair and golden, including his twin brother, Tyrion is an embarrassment to his father.  He doesn't \\"measure up\\", if you will.  His father cannot see the sharp wits and keen judge of character that are gifted to Tyrion.  He only sees his son's lack of height, and takes that to mean that Tyrion can be no leader of men, and thus, of no worth to the Lannisters. (He doesn't know what he's missing, as Tyrion is a pure delight, and every page he is on is to be savored.)<br /><br />In exile are the remains of the Great House Targaryen, brother and sister, Viserys and Daenerys.  The Targaryens are the House of the Dragons, quite literally.  At one time a great and powerful dynasty, with dragons at their command, now the dragons are gone, and the kingdom has been lost (to the king mentioned above, no less).  In desperation to win back his late father's throne, cold-blooded Viserys sells his sister into wedlock with Khal Drogo, the leader of the barbaric tribe, the Dothraki.  A nomadic people,  the Dothraki treasure their horses, and have such a wealth of gold that they wear the metal in their hair and adorning their bodies.  These people could be a distinct threat to the kingdom now run by the Baratheons and Lannisters, if they did not hold a fear of crossing the sea that separates one land from the other.

I'm writing this from memory, as my reading of the book was many moons ago.  Thank you for your tolerance., Viserys and Daenerys.  The Targaryens are the House of the Dragons, quite literally.  At one time a great and powerful dynasty, with dragons at their command, now the dragons are gone, and the kingdom has been lost (to the king mentioned above, no less).  In desperation to win back his late father's throne, cold-blooded Viserys sells his sister into wedlock with Khal Drogo, the leader of the barbaric tribe, the Dothraki.  A nomadic people,  the Dothraki treasure their horses, and have such a wealth of gold that they wear the metal in their hair and adorning their bodies.  These people could be a distinct threat to the kingdom now run by the Baratheons and Lannisters, if they did not hold a fear of crossing the sea that separates one land from the other.

B001FB55HQ|5.0|I just finished watching this movie with hubby an hour ago for the first time. I never seen or new there was a Terminator 4. I just new about Terminator 1 and 2. When I looked up 1 and 2 to order off of Amazon I found out about 3 and 4. I now have all 4 Terminators. I've been watching each one in order the past few days. And I think Terminator 4 is a good movie. I don't think it is the best Terminator. The 3rd Terminator is the best one, but I enjoyed it just as much as the other three.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game overall. I enjoy the process of having to unlock each level and that they do not come unlocked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started reading it, it was almost impossible to put down. I do most of my reading in the evening and once started, the night light stayed on for much longer than other times. What a refreshing read. Light and at the same timing moving.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an absolute page turner--did not want to put down.  William Landay captured emotions in this story that you never want to feel or have your loved ones feel.  Amazingly complex plot, delivered perfectly.  Mr. Landay's character development at the beginning of the book is what really made this story shine.  He patiently painted the picture of the happy suburban family, upper middle class, living the dream.  And one day the dream turns into a nightmare beyond belief.  No spoilers here--but let me assure you that once you get in the thick of this book, you are unable to put it down.  The emotions, the thought process, the just awfullness of what happens in this family is hard to believe--yet believable--and horrific to imagine ever having to endure.  I suggest you dig in!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Summer just started when I finished reading this book, and I now I want to go camping so bad!<br /><br />I picked up this book very randomly, I clicked on it by mistake and then noticed it was recommended by Oprah.  So I started reading it and could never put it back down.  At first I wondered how can she write several pages about a hiking trip, but the author was able to capture my attention from the beginning to the end.  She did an amazing job at describing the nature surrounding her during her hike on the PCT.  I was also surprised to see how many people she encountered and the relationship she had with each of them was very captivating.  Finally, the book describes the author`s battles and struggles in a very honest and open way, and it felt real, although at points I wondered if it wasn't a bit exagerated.<br /><br />All in all, the book was very interesting as a whole.  A few pictures also would of been nice because I found myself looking for the area's she was going on Google every once in a while.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves nature, and those who loves to read about someone`s personal journey and battles in life.
B0086700CM|5.0|it took a long time to get it on the kindle but I have played it before. just fun enough to keep short attention spans interested and cheap enough too :) I really wish they had instructions for the wings because I couldn't figure it out for a while but I got it now.

I think they requiered some experience on modular origami, but they are so good that tha book is like a game.<br /><br />Thank you

B001OST0LW|1.0|This movie was disappointing but almost all sequals that I have seen are.  I always wonder why they don't use the original actor(s).
B008EL25LE|3.0|Bought the game. Paid 6$. Not worth it. Already beat the game in a few hours. The stuff you have to find in the pictures is crazy and you only get 1 minute. Game is ok but not for 6$. Oh and its the first game I have downloaded that didn't ask for a review. Wonder Why...!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|don't buy this game it takes up way to much space and takes an hour to download. plus its way to easy until level 13 then u cant win
6305718954|3.0|Stigmata is a decent little horror film. The haunting imagery of stigmata and possession was spooky. The story was decent, ending was okay but nothing special. My main issue was with the lead, Patricia Arquett; I thought she was bad in this film, a lot of her dialogue seems forced and emotionless and just boring. Everyone else was decent. The music in was bad, the club music should've stayed in the club scenes. It would've benefited from a better soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, its creepy and has some great scares, but I wasn't a big fan of the acting. I recommend checking it out, at least a rental. As of 7/9/12, Stigmata is available on Netflix Streaming (the subtitles when they spoke in foreign languages was cut off during my stream.)<br /><br />It has some disturbing images, violence and blood, and partial nudity.
B004SBX112|5.0|Such an awesome game! All the angry birds games are fun, there's just something about them that's addicting. The levels are so cute and fun to play through, it's never the same boring look.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I loved this movie with all of its incredible music.  The lives of the musicians portrayed are opened up for us to see exactly what they went through during their careers.  It was a very good value.
B0068FZ0YM|5.0|First I am not writing this review about the film content. Even though I thought it was one of the Best Movie to every be made and showed how love and emotion can eat at you. I had seen the original DVD and had a copy, I wanted the Blu-Ray because of the colorful scenes in the movie. Not sure where it was filmed but, it has some of the best beautiful scenery to find in a movie for a long time. The Blu-ray copy is even more beautiful than the regular DVD.  If you dit bye the earlier version and loved it. Buy the BLu-ray, you want regret it!
076115678X|5.0|I love this book it is really like my new hair bible.  It has a section to help you identify your curl type, it explains the curly girl method, how to wash your hair and style it (for curlies, wavies and kinkier hair too), homemade recipes, how to trim your own hair, coloring your hair, a kids section, guys sections, Q and A, updos for special occasions, and even a chemo section (among others).<br /><br />It was a really helpful book in explaining how to take better care of your curls and I find myself going back and referring to it often. And trust me for the prize the book is definitely worth it.<br /><br />The thing that I love most about this book is that after I finished reading it I had a new appreciation for my curls.  If you have naturally curly hair don't try to fight it.  The nicer you treat it the nicer it will treat you.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was phenomenal. It's one of those that will stay with me for a long time. The characters were beautifully created and the storyline was fresh and soulful. The romance was gut wrenching and had me cheering for Layken and Will and their happily ever after from the beginning. I'd highly recommend this book to others.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Great feel good, family friendly movie.  highly recommended.  it is  a reminder of what the human spirit is capable of.

B007VT6QSI|5.0|40% percent of the people I know are `Beliebers'. Another 40% of the people I know have a hatred of Justin Bieber. The other 20% are neutral. I have always considered myself with the 20%.  Besides \\"U Smile\\", I hadn't really cared much for the music from his first album.  However, I have always believed he was talented and seemed like a good kid. I've always thought the haters were too harsh and mean spirited.<br /><br />Now that Bieber is 18, it's his time to show a more matured sound. \\"Believe\\", his second album, is what \\"Off The Wall\\" was to Michael Jackson and what \\"Justified\\" was to Justin Timberlake.  And the music here is more mature than what he's done before. But it is not that mature. The lyrics are always lighthearted and simple, nothing sophisticated. His voice has shown growth and improvement (and I think he's a pretty good singer).  Stylistically, there are more R&B influences and the production is edgier. There's help from new electronic producers like Diplo and Zedd, and new hip-hop/R&B producers like Bei Maejor and Hit-Boy.<br /><br />Overall, I like most of the songs on the album.  It will convince some that were previously in the neutral camp (like me). It won't convince virtually any of the haters, though (they don't like this type of music, so why bother). \\"Off The Wall\\" era Michael Jackson is probably Bieber's biggest influence on this album. Like Jackson, Bieber blends pop, R&B, and dance, and can achieve equally with upbeat songs and ballads.  It's not as good as \\"Off The Wall\\", but that a HARD feat to fill.<br /><br />\\"Catching Feeling\\", the fourth track on the album, directly copies the sound of \\"Off The Wall\\". \\"Die In Your Arms\\" samples an early 70s Jackson song and channels Jackson during that era. The rest of the album is modern sounding. Like most rhythmic pop artists nowadays, the album is informed largely by both Euro dance-pop and American R&B.  My favorite tracks are \\"Right Here\\" (R&B/hip-hop song featuring Drake), \\"Beauty and The Beat\\" (upbeat electro-pop) and \\"One Love\\" (dance-inflected ballad).<br /><br />Bieber has potential to make even better music when he's older, and I'm confident he will.at\\" (upbeat electro-pop) and \\"One Love\\" (dance-inflected ballad).<br /><br />Bieber has potential to make even better music when he's older, and I'm confident he will.

0061997811|5.0|I typically write longer reviews, and for works that exist more in the realm of full literature. But I had to drop a line concerning the Film Wizardry book I received last Christmas.<br /><br />I finally got around to reading it, well experiencing, from cover to cover. What a wonderful addition to the reader's collection. To join your seven books and eight films, how about a realistic copy of Harry's map! I loved reading about the actors and actresses from the film, their character interpretations, and the making of the movies. The details revealed concerning everything from directing to special effects and props are all fantasic glimpses into the tools employed to bring the world of Harry Potter not just to the screen, but to life.<br /><br />My admission. In my the basement of my home, dedicated nearly entirely to fantasy and all things medieval, I have a small corner that houses potion bottles, my tribute to HP. Each of the bottles, antiques I've found here and there...yellowed and worn glass, has a label/sticker (from this very book) attached to add the final and most important touch. I think I'll be framing the map next.<br /><br />Great buy, great/short read, great experience. Recommended for the fan of the films and books alike. However, if you've only read the books, this might not mean as much to you.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|For those of you who have already read the book, you'll note the provocative nature of my title. For those of you who haven't, you're probably aware there is a tiger in the boat with our protagonist. Richard Parker is the tiger (or perhaps more as you'll come to discover).<br /><br />As such, we all have a Richard Parker, an entity of such profound existential proportions and life-changing consequences that we have to deal with him, tame him, maybe eliminate him altogether. Mine's God. Thus, I avoided this book for years, mostly for theological reasons. My God-fearing friends recommended it time and again, but I had to be patient, wait to discover it for myself. Finally, I put it on a holiday shopping list and found it under the tree. I read the first 100 pages or so, then took a break for about six months before finishing in just a couple days. I can't explain why I left Pi stranded there with his tiger for so long, perhaps I was testing him, or he was testing me.<br /><br />As a story, Life of Pi is intriguing and curious. Readers can put themselves in Pi's place, more for the survival aspect than the more fantastical interactions with the zoo-inspired food chain. As someone interested in science and story, I was captivated by the descriptions of desalinating water, fishing for turtles, and otherwise traversing the scope of the human capability for continued existence.<br /><br />Throughout the work, we're treated to glimpses of theme, revelations of everything from faith to coping mechanisms. Regardless of other reviewers' treatments of the piece, I find Martel might even be suggesting faith is itself a defense mechanism. Critics have equated the novel to God and all things theological. I see it as a twisted horror story dressed in allegory; I hope both aspects are handled with due care in the upcoming film version. (For those of you who haven't seen it, I caught a short film preview at a recent trip to the theatre. They played a continuous scene; flying fish bombarding the raft. It was visually captivating. I'm eager to go see it.)<br /><br />I don't lightly title my review. I use it to bring to light my own final interpretation of the theme. Discover your own Richard Parker. God and faith are mine, entities I've explored, researched, doubted, and more. For this reason, I identified with the novel in terms of those using faith as a defense mechanism, a reality made evident just by simply watching the news or talking to people.<br /><br />Life of Pi is worth reading, worth discussing, and worth each reader developing his or her opinions. I probably avoided it for aforementioned reasons as well as its commercial appeal (no reason to avoid anything, really). But, there's also better out there, even in the genre of theological, survival fiction (where's that section at the Book Store?). It's one of those books I read when I need a break from my normal. If you need a similar break, or desire a read that based on some reviews is controversial, God-inspired, God-inspiring, fun, boring, what-have-you, then go for it.barding the raft.

B007R41E8O|2.0|I would rather do nothing than play this game. for once every bad review was correct. the game just leads you around different scenes to do one small task or sometimes nothing just to give you stuff to do. sometimes there is no clue as to what to do next and you just have to hit hint. the puzzles are dumb. basically the game doesn't flow like others. they don't do a good job connecting the scenes to each other and have too many transitional areas for it to be fun. DONT PAY FOR THIS

B00884GR0W|5.0|I haven't bought the game yet&hellip; but I have read the reviews to figure out it's probly a good game. I am a HUGE minecraft fan (mainly xbox version, though) so this looks like a cool game slightly related to Minecraft. And for all the ppl who rate it 1-3 stars because it isn't minecraft (or because it's closely related to Minecraft) IT'S NOT SUPPOST TO BE MINECRAFT! (or sure it's like minecraft, but that doesn't give u ANY perrmission to accuse the created of stealing the idea) I may or may not buy the game, but it's WAY cheaper than the XBOX version of minecraft (20$) or the PC version of minecraft (30$) I hope the ppl who rated this terribly read this review, because this game DESERVES 5*****

B005DC68NI|5.0|If you have ever debated with yourself over self-publishing your book or going the more `respectable,' traditional route to getting published, you owe it to yourself to read David Gaughran's  excellent coverage of the current state of the publishing world. He adds interviews with 33 self-published authors, some of whom I've read on Kindle.<br /><br />What I like about these interviews is that they are mostly up-and-coming authors who are just beginning to make enough money they can afford to quit their full-time employment so as to live their dreams of being full-time authors. Admittedly he also has some of the super success stories like, J Carson Black, who has sold 100,000 Kindle e-books in less than a year.<br /><br />I really appreciated the background he included, like how advances really work, how small advances normally are, and why the average author will never see royalties.<br /><br />This is largely due to the way the `returns policy' works. I had previously heard about this system but only in passing. This is the first I have read about how it actually works.<br /><br />David Gaughran gives some extremely helpful tips and advice on the practical side of self-publishing, such as the emphasis he puts on 1) hiring an editor to make sure your book reads professionally and 2) getting a professionally designed book cover.<br /><br />If you have wondered about how to price your self-published book, Gaughran covers that too. His strategy and advice on where to publish was eye-opening for me.<br /><br />As an Internet marketer, I still picked up suggestions I hadn't thought about. I've heard of forums though I haven't invested the time in them that I obviously should. Most of the writers he interviewed here or whom he described got their audiences through forums and online book reviewers.<br /><br />I found this book to be exactly what I need to advance my knowledge of self-publishing. I'll be applying his advice as soon as I update my Kindle e-book, How Relationship Selling Rewards Small Businesses. I'll definitely redo my cover.ship Selling Rewards Small Businesses. I'll definitely redo my cover.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love the 'no hurry, no stress'  game play.  Sometimes your in the mood for a game that doesn't require constant attention like zen pinball hd which while awesome, people think you are rude as you cannot even look away from the screen while playing.  Not overly addicting, but you will come back again and again and fall for the same tricks in the game....  Great for the overly logic thinkers out there.
0345803493|1.0|I will confess, I found the first book in this trilogy enticing, though exceptionally poorly written. I got sucked right into the \\"red room of pain\\" and wanted more. But this book? The plot was crafted on crepe paper, the \\"twists\\" beyond predictable, and the supporting cast of characters lacked even a single dimension. The protagonist, Ana, has an \\"inner goddess\\" who does arabesques and triple axles whenever Ana gets laid, gets a new job, or gets a new Saab. Ana's other inner voice whispers \\"jeez\\" and \\"down there\\" on a regular basis. Bottom line: A Harlequin Romance with a cat o' nine tails, and the cat o' nine tails doesn't even get used. I must be into sadomasochism myself, because I finished reading this. I need to go flog myself now.

0345803493|4.0|I had seen this book in a store and since it was the 2nd book in a trilogy I had only purchased the first one as I was unsure if I would like them, then after reading most of the first one I wanted the next one in the series but did not care to make the hour and 1/2 trip back to the nearest store to buy it, so I ordered from Amazon and was surprised to see it was even cheaper than the store's discount price and was shipped to me in just a few days!  Very pleased!!

Seriously don't waste your money if you like or love thier first three albums, this is nothing like them.  What happened guys?  I know bands need to grow, but this music just isn't enjoyable. Sorry, but it's the truth.  If you are wondering where your fans went, they went to go find better music, like you used to make..
B007J4T2G8|2.0|...so lump me in with the latter crowd.<br /><br />This was nothing more than a bad romance novel that jumped the tracks early on. Ms James deserves her own spanking for this atrocity.  I gave the book 2 stars instead of one because my wife liked it.  Hmmm... perhaps she deserves a spanking as well.
B003OA6AOI|4.0|I actually liked the episode. I didn't think the acting was bad, I thought exactly the opposite. The actor who played Ianto, I thought, convinced me of his love for the cyberwoman (although half the episode I was thinking and shouting about how stupid he was...but then again love does make people do stupid things). I liked how Jack was taking charge and forcing everyone to make hard choices. He understands way more than everyone else, especially traveling with the Doctor (that is involved...right?) so i thought John Barrowman's acting was good, as well. This episode was the best so far. At parts it made me sad, angry, and nausiated (especially when Ianto hugged the pizza girl with Lisa's brain...that was really creepy).<br /><br />I don't really understand the other reviews...I actually liked this episode.

0385737955|3.0|The good the bad and the ugly about this very popular book.<br />The author has a talent that not many possess.  He ends every chapter with a cliff hanger phrase.  The story is easy to follow and you generally know what is going on in the hear and now.  I think the concept of this book is interesting and I sure would have liked to see more done with it.<br />BUT...BAADDDD<br />Those that have said they like that there is no swearing in this book, I wonder what they were reading.  Swearing abounds in this book. Basically you are saying if an author makes up similar words and uses them instead of the actual swear words this is OK?  NOT in my opinion.  Come on...shuck?  Even my friends twelve year old boy commented on the amount of ambiguous swearing that took place.<br />Ugly...<br />It flat didn't capture my interest even if it was an easy read.  I have the copy with the Scorch Trials sneak peek and I have no interest in reading the next one based on the preview.  Also a pet peeve.  When more than three characters ended up together someone was lost and then...OH...oops forgot about that person so the person had sat quietly while the others talked.<br /><br />I am in the process of writting a YA book to compliment my dystopic adult series and I want to thank Mr. Dashner. After setting mine aside for the past few months I read it again after finishing The Maze Runner and I blew myself away.  Thank you for that!  I was able to glean a better understanding of my own talents for having read this book.  Writers may want a copy.  Great therapy when you think you will never get that book just right.  Guess what!!!  You don't have to!<br /><br />Why did I give it three starts then?  I think boys ages 10 to 13 would enjoy this book immensely.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read all three and trust me it doesn't get better as you go.  I kept hoping it would but it didn't plus I never like abandoning a series once I start it, so I finished.  The author said she was inspired by Twilight and having read that series and really enjoyed it I thought I'd give this a try.  While Twilight is entirely fictional, you still find yourself rooting for the two romantic leads to be together because at the end of the day you know they are meant to be.  I could have cared less wether the romantic leads in this triology stayed together or not.  I never felt drawn into the story and attached to the characters in any way.  I read lots of other romance novels and enjoy some good erotica, but this was just bad.  The sex scenes are entirely unbelievable.  Spoiler - Anastasia being a virgin wouldn't just jump into that kind of sex, your body takes some adapting.  Basically these two people, mainly Christan Grey are seriously messed up in the head and there isn't anything romantic about their relationship.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book because I have been a Star Wars fan since the beginning and now my 4 boys are fans as well.  The boys and I sat down and read the book and we laughed and explained different scences from the movies and even used our imaginations as to what we would do if our dad was Darth Vader.  Now they want to take turns reading it to each other.  Well done!!
B005LAIH3G|1.0|The bad trailer was not the only problem for why it bombed at the box office. For those of us who had not read the book upon which the movie was based, there were far too many loose ends in the film. For example, it was not clear who had killed his wife: Indians?, outlaws?, enemy soldiers? And the motive of the shape shifters is never convincingly explained nor was it easy to understand the complex and confusing interaction that Carter had with the four-armed creatures. This was an expensive purchase that I have no desire to waste my time seeing again even if decide some day to buy a 3D television set.

Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and this movie saved the day! We started watching and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.<br /><br />So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this movie. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great movies and are turning to movies like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this movie so it is in demand! Also we like to watch this around Resurrection season and on any day, just to see the price our Abba paid and to remind us he has paid the price and he lives, so we should trust in him and lead our lives for his Glory! We already know we have the victory! I thank God everyday for paying the price for me and letting me know that I am more than a conqueror, I am a victor, I am above and not beneath! Hallelujah!  This movie will bring you to tears! You will leave this movie very grateful!<br /><br />Anyway, our family loves The Passion Of The Christ and glad that we were still able to find this movie for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV.We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it! If you want to show your family the price Christ paid for us, this is it! If you want to walk with Christ and see what he went through this is it!<br /><br />I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the movies that we want like this movie since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this movie is available on Amazon.<br /><br />This movie entertains you with lots of passion, turns and twist.. Miss those days of movies like this.

1451648537|5.0|This was the most important business book I have yet read (not having put Jeff Van Duzer's work on my list). Isaacson captures the essence of Steve Jobs, businessperson and leader and friend and enemy and human being, with a book that is less about a single man's life than it is about a narrative. This narrative, with its glorious leaps of accomplishment and sickening dives into the perversity of a bitter and poisonous self-centeredness, tells the story of a great mind inspired by tremendous themes that was bound more by its own limitations (ironically) than by the encumbrances it railed against. The book has prompted many an unfinished and burning line of thought since I picked it up and, I have no doubt, will help me navigate the journey of passion vs. control in my own leadership story. I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />JV

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been turned off by their recent offerings but I must say that this is possibly their best recording since Counterparts.I have been a fan since 1976 and have seen Rush countless times since 1979.I've been through their highs and lows and have always been a fan.Clockwork Angels is closer to their roots than previous efforts and rocks hard both with raw intensity and melodic prowess.I highly recommend this album.

145210655X|4.0|Normally I save my reviewing for longer books but this book was so much fun I just had to make a plug to help get the word out.  Darth Vader and Son was recommended a couple of months ago when I was reading another \\"Dad\\" book (\\"Dad Rules.\\").<br /><br />Darth Vader and Son is a cute and fun ~60 page art/comic book.  While the book doesn't have a particular plot arc that it follows, it has great storytelling moments that are portrayed fabulously.  As the title implies, this book is about the interactions of Darth Vader and his son.  (For the 1% of you who aren't up on Star Wars lore...be aware that this book poses some pretty blatant spoilers, though I think the spoiler grace period there ended in the early 80s).<br /><br />In the book, Luke Skywalker is a young (5-8 year old?) boy wandering the universe with his dad...the intimidating Darth Vader.  The scenes range from endearingly sweet to laugh out loud hilarious.  Aside from the blatant relation to the Star Wars universe, there are a bunch of more subtle nods to lesser known elements.<br /><br />The art style is solid and a lot of fun.  The author (Jeffrey Brown) has a website where you can get a glimpse of his art style and find links to his other work.  I haven't read or seen anything else by him but my whole family has enjoyed reading through Darth Vader and Son.  Even though we've all read it, my kids love holding the book in front of another family member with a \\"Lookit! Lookit!\\" to get us giggling again at the fun juxtaposition of the powerful Darth Vader and a cute little Luke.<br /><br />This is a fun little read for any Star Wars fan who is willing to poke a little fun at the universe.  Great for parents, kids or just kids at heart.<br /><br />****<br />4 out of 5 stars
0062213423|5.0|How do you entertain young teenage girls for the summer? BUY THIS BOOK! I've not received as many hugs and kisses ALL YEAR LONG until presenting this book to my daughter and her bestie. They don't go anywhere without toting this book with them.<br /><br />The pictures and the quality of the book are great, and in my opinion, a great purchase for the awesome price offered (under $10). The print is somewhat larger than normal (but then again, what is considered normal?) It has made for an enjoyable, fun-filled, and socialable read.<br /><br />The only CON I found as a parent would be the couple pictures where these boys are in their undies. I wish I had pre-viewed the books more thoroughly before presenting them to two overly obsessed, manic 1D fans (perhaps ripped these pages out, took a sharpie to the page, or at least bought ear plugs!) Overall, there wasn't anything I would consider 'inappropriate', nothing but legs are revealed, but I wanted to present this warning.

B0070NSPCU|4.0|My first time giving a review, but this book is worth it.  As many other reviewers have stated, the story is superb, with interesting characters and great character development.  Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the misspelling/punctation errors that slightly detract from reading. Overall, a 4.5 star book.  Definitely read it.  KJ
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Had forgotten parts of this movie but it's an oldie but goodie just like Goonies.  Everyone should see this movie. It's a fun movie, full of pranks and funny. Not a serious movie but gives a good lesson in it.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|I was excited to view this via Amazon streaming and a ROKU,.<br /><br />But ended up underwhelmed and disappointed.<br />It showed promise for some time, but when it degenerated into a slasher flick with a villain that keeps coming back?!?!?<br /><br />Seriously, this was just silly and out of place. I was not looking for an Alien rehash.<br /><br />Could have gotten a 4 out of me if we'd just abandoned that needless sideshow.<br /><br />I will admit it continues in Danny's tradition of looking at the psychological effects of unusually harsh and unrealistic circumstances (ie: Zombies in 28 days later)<br /><br />But unlike 28 days later, we did not need a monster to pop up in this one. We had a dieing world and harsh environment enough without adding a slasher in the mix.<br /><br />This is no 28 Days later,.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Great movie to watch with family.  It features real life events that do actually happen in life.  George Clooney is hilarious in this movie. Of course, I don't think I would have been as patient as Clooney with the father of his wife or the man she had an affair with but still I enjoyed the movie and the ending.
B005MQW5RI|5.0|very fun to watch in 3D. the 3D blu-ray has nice effects, and on top of that my son love it.
B005LAII0S|5.0|Really good movie.  Enjoyed the new take on the 7 dwarfs and Snow White.  It's a good movie to watch and have a good laugh.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The title of this book threw me.  I thought, how good could the book be if the title is that bad?<br /><br />I downloaded the sample- and the whole sample was the forward by the writer talking about how great his book was and how wonderful everyone else thought it was.  How people saw it as the screenplay for their life... and such.  I thought \\"oh brother, this book is either really terrible- in line with the title- or it is really a masterpiece.\\"  In the end, I bought it because I had to find out. I was intrigued by an author who would so boldly tout his greatness.<br /><br />ANYWAY- um, wow.  This book really is one of the great works of literature for all time, for all societies, for all ages...  I think the hardest part is figuring out how to describe it to others, in a way that makes them want to read it.  - it's entertaining, it's light but deep.  It perfectly lays out the human condition: how we lead, how we follow, how we grow up, how we rear, how we judge, how we conform or rebel.  Who excels and succeeds and why. From a macro (world politics and war with masterful aliens) and a micro (a family, a little boy, a battalion of children drafted and formed into soldiers) level.<br /><br />It lays out how you play others and how you get played.  It's every person's experience from some point of view.  But here's what's really fantastic- it's also instructional- like the Art of War- but in a fable format.<br /><br />I found myself wanting to take notes from this story- about how to motivate others and how to navigate the political waters of corporate America.  I started to see my current life in a different light and see what games others were playing with me, how I was being manipulated, and how I might maneuver in those situations to reach the outcome I want.  *I would only use my power for good, of course.  But that's what this book does/is as well- it's powerful.  It is a fun read- you could just read the story and find enjoyment on the surface.  But you havea sense that if you could absorb the wisdom from the story, really LEARN the deeper truths and master the art of well... manipulation, (strategy,engagement & leadership)then you really would be a powerful force in your world.  You could do anything- you could be Ender- mastering the game, winning the war... but unbroken.<br /><br />If you could master the art, you could win, whole and able to enjoy your life.  That's the truth of the story- excelling, winning, overcoming, doesn't mean you don't lose pieces of yourself along the way, or that you reach old age and success in happiness and health.  What keeps Enders going is hope that at some point you will be at peace with yourself, your performance, your environment, your role, others' roles, relationships, well- everything.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I loved this movie!!! I think everyone should have a copy and watch it several times.  Enjoy seeing a piece of history in a great movie.

Although the writer really kept my attention with some humerous interaction.... I totally was lost when Matt from the Today show said this was a book of an \\"older\\" man and an innocent college student..?? what?? 26 is not an \\"older\\" man to me -- he's a few years older than her! I didn't realize that this was an actual triology... sorry... just thought it was a series so was very disappointed with the ending.  Have no interest in getting books 2 & 3.  Sorry. I'll stick with Gena Showalter, Laura Leigh or even Larissa Leone.

B007NUP6GS|5.0|Bach's six (or so) surviving motets rank very high with those who love his vocal music. This is probably because they afford direct, continuous contact with SINGERS doing what Bach was best at: COUNTERPOINT. To put it more broadly, Bach was supremely gifted at creating complex but appealing multi-voiced musical fabrics guided by harmony. Just as we prize works like Art of Fugue, The \\"Goldberg\\" Variations, and The Well-Tempered Clavier because of their great fugues and other contrapuntal inventions, so can we enjoy the motets. Vocally, they are extremely rich per-square-inch in Bachian counterpoint.<br /><br />Besides counterpoint, the motets have expressive, varied texts, usually taken from hymns or scripture; thus in a literary sense they also stand head and shoulders above much of the third-rate poetic dreck with which Bach was saddled -- it must be said -- in the cantatas, for example.<br /><br />An earlier recording of the motets by this conductor with the Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists ([[ASIN:B000005E9X Bach: Motets BWV 225-231, Cantatas]]) also won critical praise. I have the LP, and it's glorious, especially for its varied instrumental accompaniments and its glistening analog sound. This new edition dispenses with the instruments except for a basic continuo group. That has the beneficial effect of focusing attention on the vocal ensemble, which remains small -- perhaps three or four to a part for works that vary from four to five to eight parts.<br /><br />Gardiner's long experience with Bach, and his use of seasoned vocalists, pays off. Every measure glows. Every phrase is alive with rhythmic energy. One of the great delights of this new recording is that you can hear the singers exuberantly doing things in the excitement of live performance that might not have withstood the patch-and-edit process in a studio recording. (Note: I am NOT saying that the performances are ever sloppy or over-the-top. Absolutely not. They're just happier, sadder, more rhythmic, etc. etc. than you might have thought Bach could get.)<br /><br />Check out the cover of the CD (actually a nice little book, with Gardiner's insightful notes on each work plus texts and translations). It features high-wire artist Philippe Petit inching his way across some chasm or another, barefoot. Anyone who's ever tried to perform this music will understand why Gardiner and company chose it.<br /><br />Top recommendation, without reservations.more rhythmic, etc. etc. than you might have thought Bach could get.)<br /><br />Check out the cover of the CD (actually a nice little book, with Gardiner's insightful notes on each work plus texts and translations).

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Even the \\"good guys\\" in this tale are difficult to like initially.  By the end of the first book - the author has you hooked on the questionable morale decisions by the charatcters.  Initially difficult to get the authors writing method down - maybe because it was originally written in Swedish and a lot of the names are similiar and you aren't quite sure how to pronounce them.  Once you get past that and a few extremely graphic/violent scenes in the first book - you really end up liking the story.  I found I really enjoyed the differences that were apparent between the suthor's protraital of freedom of speech/judicial system in Sweden and that of the United States.  A great action packed, very well written, with plot twists and turns the whole way!  Really was a great read!
B007L96SI6|1.0|I'm skipping this overrated Haley CD,I'm not feeling the music or her annoying voice.I see other AI artists alot better than this.So yes,thumbs down for me.I just can't get into annoying artists,oh well thanks for putting up all samples,saves me money :)
B004LWZW8I|3.0|This is action pacted movie about one of the greatest Greek warriors Theseus.  He is favorite of Gods and Zeus takes personal interest in him.  Zeus is his teacher and mentor that helps in creation of a wise and capable warrior that one day will save all of Greece.  It is a tale that from the beginning goes with the statement that \\"all men's souls are immortal, but the righteous men's souls are both immortal and divine\\".  What is mankind supposed to do when ambition pairs itself with evil?  King Hyperion (played by Mickey Rourke), consumed by grief for the loss of his family and his personal hatred of Gods, creates a powerful army that will take on all of the Greece and Mount Olympus in a quest for power.  In this war, only Theseus can lead mankind to fight its evil.<br /><br />There is a lot of action in this movie and in some ways, this film is a cheaper take on the movie like \\"300\\".  I liked the story and the brutality of the ancient world that is so honestly portrayed int his film.  The really weak part is the costume design for the film.  It is overdone and not particularly appealing.<br /><br />Great movie for the weekend relaxation.  Not too memorable, though.

B000002H6C|4.0|The first time I reviewed this album I said it was mediocre, that it was a lazy effort that hinted at the downfall of thrash. Yeah that was a little harsh and over time, I have seen the error of my ways. While no where near as good as Ride The Lightning, this album does hold its own compared to a few other performances by other metal bands at that time (lyrical wise). \\"Blackened\\" Starts off this album with a nice buildup intro, the lyrics are as dark as the song title. While the musicianship isn't as aggressive as it could have been, I will say I do like Kirk's solo around the 4:30 mark. Next we have the title track at almost 10 minutes long this track thunders the whole way through, once it gets going that is. Plus this is Metallica's most politically charged moment in their career, which I find pretty cool. Very few genres of music can actually cover topics as big as say political corruption, child abuse, and being a vegetable that had his arms and legs blown off by a landmine. I'll even say this might be their darkest album. \\"Blackened\\" 'Independence limited, freedom of choice is made for you my friend...Freedom with their exception' Possibly some of their best lyrics of all time. \\"One\\" The semi-ballad that draws a listener into thinking this will be a slow paced song with no real expectation of anything else and then BOOM! Like a landmine (yes that's a Metallica pun) the song explodes around the 4:40 mark. One (another pun!) of my favorite songs from the band of all time. \\"The Shortest Straw\\" possibly my least favorite song on the album...it seems stale to me, no double bass, recycled riffs, but not to worry the next track redeems it. \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" another great track that builds up and in my opinion one of James's best vocal performances. I think the song is about child abuse? Someone correct me if I'm wrong but once again, the guys attack another hard to fathom social issue that they bring to light for the public. \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" Interesting intro but I'm not a real fan of this one either, just can't seem to feel the energy. \\"To Live Is To Die.\\" I'll say this is an instrumental since only six words are said. But it is a decent ballad and adds to the darkness of the album. And last \\"Dyers Eve\\" My third favorite Metallica song of all time. A great all out thrasher. The band had a great showing with this track. Overall, if production was better, a few of the tracks were more energetic, and if the band wouldn't have lost Burton (nothing against Newstead at all, just if emotions still wern't running high after being the first album without him) then maybe this could have been a 5 star album, possibly a masterpiece. But it falls short behing a few other album of '88 but it is still a timeless classic and should be heard by any metal fan.tro but I'm not a real fan of this one either, just can't seem to feel the energy. \\"To Live Is To Die.\\" I'll say this is an instrumental since only six words are said.

B00005V0X5|5.0|Aside from the pun this album is a thrash onslaught. Although no where near as influential as Peace Sells or Rust In Peace, this album holds a special place in my metal heart (Accept metal pun) this is my personal favorite album from the band Megadeth. We start off with the hauntingly dark \\"Last Rites/Loved To Deth\\" We start off with a piano and bass combo that sets the mood for this killer track. Dark and dreary is how it begins and then BOOM! Musical anarchy at its finest. The guitars are blazing fast, and Dave's vocals sound so messed up but compliment the lyrics perfectly. Quite possibly one of the darkest thrash songs the band has ever released. \\"Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good\\" My second favorite Megadeth track of all time! The riffs are amazing and the drums are great as well. Gar's performance is really spectacular. \\"The Skull Beneath The Skin\\" the story of Vic. (Megadeth's mascot for those new people) Starts off with Dave's infamous \\"WHOOOAAAHH!!\\" and then becomes a break neck thrasher. Full of riffs and really interesting lyrics this track leaves you craving more metal. \\"These Boots\\" is the cover track that has been dubbed over. People don't give a whole album a 1 star review simply because the cover song is screwed up. Yes its a great cover but deal with it. \\"Rattlehead\\" is another great track. In fact, these first four tracks are all impressive on their own it is scary how taleneted the band was especially for this being their debut. \\"Chosen Ones\\" starts off like Killing Is My Business except toned down a few beats per minute. Overall, its a good track and shouldn't disappoint. \\"Looking Down The Cross\\" Just as dark and dreadful as Last Rites. It is the story of Jesus and his last hours on earth. How he could have destroyed all of mankind in a firey vengence and commanded pestilence to destroy us all. The solo is probably the best off the whole album and there is a jazz feeling on this track that is thanks to Gar Samuelson and David Ellefson that really sets Megadeth apart from the other bands at the time. And last we have \\"Mechanix\\" Great riff and a classic work from Dave Mustaine himself. (No I will not get into the Megadeth Metallica battle. Both bands are great and legends and both have a great fan base. If things didn't workout the way they did we wouldn't have Master Of Puppets and Rust In Peace)<br />Overall, this is a great album from my favorite band. Although I like it more than Peace Sells and Rust In Peace, I realize those were more successful than the debut.

0345403959|5.0|Belgarath the Sorcerer is best read after both the Belgariad and the Mallorean. Although it is a standalone novel, the prologue is built upon events that happen at the end of the Mallorean.<br /><br />How to describe the novel? Calling it a history book is a grave injustice, on the scale of calling a Lamborghini a car (which it is, of course, but surely you can come up with far more dazzling ways to describe a Lamborghini.) \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" is the story of one man's love--for his god, for his wife, for his \\"brothers\\", for his daughters, and for people. It is the story of duty and responsibility (and a sense of humor) that persists in spite of decade-long diversions, centuries-long sidetracks, and millennia-long grief.<br /><br />Eddings manages pace very well--speeding through centuries in a paragraph, and then spending whole chapters on the events of a few weeks--without leaving the reader dizzy from wondering what just happened. The flow of the story seamlessly carries the reader along through detailed scenes. Characters are both vivid and memorable, and readers will enjoy seeing how all those insider jokes from the Belgariad started.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable read. When you're done with this, pick up his next book, [[ASIN:0345422554 Polgara the Sorceress (Malloreon)]]
B000002H2H|5.0|When I was a young lad this album was shown to me by my father. I have been in love with metal ever since. I must give credit where credit is due, this is Metallica's best album. We start off this monster with Fight Fire With Fire, a tale about nuclear warfare, this track thunders and demolishes anything around during 1984. Plus this is a rare occurance here but I was impressed with Lar's on the drums. And Kirk's solo is one of his best on this track. Next we have the title track and one of my personal favorite songs as a kid, Ride The Lightning. From the opening riffs, the listener can draw their own conclusion that this track is menacing. How else would someone write a song about a guy stuck in the electric chair? Another one of my personal favorite songs of all time For Whom The Bell Tolls. (I tried to get my middle school wrestling team to come out and wrestle to this as kid, but some people didn't like it for some reason) This is my favorite Metallica song of all time. Menacing, heavy, and epic. James's voice has never sounded better. Fade To Black, the suicidal ballad that is just as heavy as the rest of the album. The solo is amazing and the overall feeling of this song is one that Metallica would never recapture again on any other album. Trapped Under Ice would be the low point on this album compared to all the greats. This song isn't bad, its actually an amazing thrasher. If there was a low point though it would have to be this one. Next is Escape and it is their most underrated song. It retains a New Wave of Heavy Metal feeling to it, but it gets the Metallica overhaul. And the lyrics are inspiring in a way. Now for the most intense track on the album, Creeping Death. At over six minutes, this song will DESTROY your neck. It talks about how the angel of death freed the Hebrew people from the Egyptians as in the book of Exodus in the Bible. Absolutely one of the best tracks. And last is the instrumental The Call of Ktulu. Dave Mustaine has credits on this song as well and it just proves how great both bands Metallica and Megadeth are. One of my favorite instrumentals and has a Rust In Peace feeling to it. Overall, Metallica's second effort put them in the lead of other metal bands around this time, only thing comparable would be Slayer's release. Metallica released an amazing masterpiece of an album that stands the test of time, and the test of other bands today. If you want a Metallica album its best if you start here.ong as well and it just proves how great both bands Metallica and Megadeth are.

B000002IKR|5.0|The debut of the Bay Area masters of thrash, Testament. The Legacy is a title that is fitting for an album of this intensity of hooks, riffs, tempo changes, and of course, Chuck Billy's vocals. \\"Over The Wall\\" starts off this monster of a debut. Chuck Billy screeches, growls, yells, and does almost anything he can do deliever an intense performance, and he does. The double bass drumming is nice, and Skolnick has a killer solo as well. The main riff is catchy as can be and rivals albums such as \\"Terror Squad\\" by Artillery in the riff department. \\"The Haunting\\" a simple riff starts off this song. Chuck's vocals are fast paced to keep up with the drumming. The solo is great on this track as well. \\"Burnt Offerings\\" wow, what an intro. Incredibly melodic and then becomes an all-out power driven track. The main riff sounds like doom is just around the next riff. Speaking off riffs, I dare you to listen to this track and not headbang. \\"Raging Waters\\" It is the first average track on the album. It isn't bad, it just doesn't stack up to the first few tracks. \\"Curse Of The Legions Of Death\\" This track is the way thrash was meant to be played. Intense, fast paced, heavy, and evil sounding. Chuck even does his death metal growl here that he will use in other albums. His growls are some of the best in metal, no lie. \\"First Strike Is Deadly\\" starts off with a strange intro but explodes to become an onslaught of riffs. The drumming is powerful, and the guitars are on fire! Skolnick's solo is incredibly beautiful on this track, in fact its one of his bests. \\"Do Or Die\\" another average track. The beat is catchy and so is the chorus. But it lacks the intensity of the likes of the past two tracks. \\"Alone In The Dark\\" another killer track, a bit slower paced, but still gets the job done. \\"Apocalyptic City\\" Starts off melodic and becomes a breakneck thrasher. The gang vocals add to the intensity. The riffs are melodic and catchy.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best debuts in history. The production is great, and the riffs are in a whole other world. Drumming, powerful. Lyrics, catchy. Chuck's voice, historical. One of the best thrash albums of all time and easily comes into my spot of the Top 10 thrash albums of all time.tory. The production is great, and the riffs are in a whole other world.

B000002IRL|5.0|I saw the gypsy woman reading my fortune with \\"Bare Bones\\". After getting my \\"Horrorscope\\" read, I had to pay in \\"Blood Money\\". Little did I know in a few hours I would be put in a \\"Coma\\". Hooked up to a \\"New Machine\\", I felt like \\"Frankenstein\\". In my \\"Soulitude\\" I was sure it was \\"A Nice Day...For a Funeral\\". Once I woke, I looked at the doctor and said \\"Thanx For Nothin'\\" The morale of this story friends is \\"Live Young...Die Free.\\"<br /><br />Okay maybe I got carried away there. But Horrorscope is no joke, this album is a grade A asskicking. Sadly, it is the last genuine thrash album until Ironbound. But this is the follow up to Years Of Decay, Horrorscope combines melodies with thunderous guitar and bass. The drums add more power to the overall classic album. Blitz's vocals are as haunting as ever, though not as high pitched as in the past albums, he really comes into his own on tracks like \\"Horrorscope\\" \\"Coma\\" \\"Nice Day...For A Funeral\\" and \\"Soulitude\\". At the time, this was Overkill's darkest recording. \\"Bare Bones\\" starts with a creepy piano/guitar intro and becomes a double bass thrash onslaught. The album, Horrorscope, covers topics like war, death, suicide, and the fragile state of mind we all have. Musically I'm not sure if it is as good as Years Of Decay, but the melodies in the last two tracks are amazing. In fact, \\"Nice Day...For A Funeral\\" and \\"Soulitude\\" I will say (and you can quote me if you prefer) are the best one, two punch combos to end a thrash metal album. The darkness and sorrow is unparralled in thrash. Overall, this is a must buy along with Years Of Decay. If you like heavy, dark, and menacing music check out Horrorscope. Any Overkill fan will tell you it is one of their best albums.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|If I could I would rate it more. I bought these thinking that they were just erotic fiction but they are so much more. A story of love, about two people that were made for each other, that from their first glance it's over. That pull between them is palpable. I think that both Grey and Ana are both wounded and broken and looking for their own medicine or panacea.  I finished all three in a weekend! WOW!! After reading them I remember the journey that love takes us on and the rewards that it gives us.
0060873027|1.0|This book is so horrible that I decided to labor all the way through it as a test of my literary endurance. Actually, I don't know why I finished it. I think it had something to do with my love and respect for the name on the cover, who most certainly was not the author of this adolescent clunker.<br /><br />Everything that is great about Michael Crichton is missing from this gangly, awkward, lowbrow wreckage of what was probably a scribble of an idea from the great author. Most notably, is the science. Crichton is known for divining a carefully crafted premise from real-life cutting edge research and adding just enough fictional technology to make the concept fly. He would painstakingly work within the bounds of his tweaked reality to keep the story exciting and plausible at the same time. Conversely, Mr. Preston can't even seem to keep spatial relationships consistent in his micro-world, and his source material appears to cut off somewhere around Mrs. Carmichael's seventh grade Life Sciences class. Yet, I understand that Crichton's talents were unique in that sense, and I could forgive a shortcoming in this area. It is Preston's mangling of basic literary craft that angered me most.<br /><br />The storyline is contrived to the point that I would place it just below no-name juvenile fiction one might find in the clearance bin at the dollar store. The characters have the depth and dimension of a middle school lit project. I have to wonder how this book even made it to press in this state. The basic style and structure of the writing does not, in my opinion, read like the work of a professional.<br /><br />I love everything Michael Crichton has written, so I can only imagine that his involvement with this manuscript extended no further than the partially completed forward and perhaps a few scribbles in a notebook. This is the opposite of vintage Crichton and it makes me furious that his name is on the cover.
159102594X|1.0|While looking for something to read after finishing A Dance with Dragons by GRRM, I read several reviews comparing this book with his series. I decided to give it a try. I was sadly disappointed. This isn't at all like the rich tapestry that Martin paints. The characters aren't likable, the world feels small, and the writing is very matter-of-factly. The story is very linear and predictable. If you're looking for something comparable to Martin, look elsewhere.

0374275637|3.0|I've read excerpts of Daniel Kahneman's work in many other books about decision making and rationality so I was really looking forward to reading this book. While I found much of the material interesting I didn't find the book to be an enjoyable read like I do Malcolm Gladwell, Dan Ariely or Robert Cialdini's works. As a result it took quite a while to plow through it and I enjoy this kind of stuff. I state that up front because I think a causal reader of those books would be disappointed with Thinking, Fast and Slow. I did find many parts interesting and they gave me pause to consider how what was shared might be impacting my thought processes. I will use some of what I learned when I blog and train people but again, I'd caution the average reader on this one. Flip through a copy at the bookstore or read some of the free chapters before making the purchase just to be certain it's for you.

B007WFR1MQ|2.0|You kids giving this album 4 and 5 stars must not have been old enough to watch this band \\"grow\\" over the years.  I got into the band upon hearing their track on the At Death's Door II compilation back in the day and immediately purchased \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" and have followed their career ever since.  I would claim \\"Demanufacture\\" (even though a departure from their \\"roots\\") as the pinnacle of their career.  \\"Obsolete\\" being good but not \\"as good\\", and \\"Digimortal\\" being their weakest output.  \\"Archtype\\" was an outstanding comeback and \\"Transgression\\" further proof that the band can write new, fresh, solid material after the departure of Dino.  Then of course a change in the regime and Dino's back and they put out \\"Mechanize\\" which I put as their second weakest album...until perhaps now.  \\"Industrialist\\" is simply more of the same.  Somewhere between Mechanize and Demanufacture in terms of sound, style and approach.  But mainly regurgitated riffs, songwriting, style...everything.  Nothing new, and dumbed-down metal for the uneducated masses.  Certainly NOT a \\"return to roots\\" as anyone with a brain having heard \\"Soul...\\", its predecessor \\"Concrete\\" as well as their two demos can attest to.  I had high hopes for the album.  The thought of a drum machine, the hype about \\"returning to their old sound\\", the title of the album, their decision to cover Pitchshifter and Sonic Violence tracks as bonuses...  Everything was pointing to the possibilty of a new approach on their music.  Something different and exciting.  I had always said since Obsolete came out that they needed to go back and listen to their Godflesh albums.  So much potential for this band to impress.  But instead they jsut simply stuck themselves in \\"safe territory\\", like most modern metal bands tend to do these days.

B005ORVN1Y|5.0|Canadian progressive rock titans Rush's 15 albums that they recorded for Mercury Records were re-released in November of 2011 as the three 5-CD/1-DVD box sets Rush Sectors.<br />When I first got wind that Rush would be (like Pink Floyd and Queen each did throughout 2011) were updating their Mercury Records catalog, I didn't go out right away fearing that the remasters would not be as good as what Bob Ludwig did in 1997 and also was busy with upgrading the Pink Floyd catalog and put off buying the Rush Sector box sets until I moved back to Massachusetts in March of 2012. I went for Sector 2 first as they were the key Rush albums in the band's catalog and was blown away at how much better they sounded to the previous remasters, each album was improved upon in some way or another.<br />Then in April of 2012, I acquired Sectors 1 and 3. This review is for the third Sector box set.<br />The albums in this third of three Rush box sets are the band's last five albums for Mercury/PolyGram (the 1982 masterpiece Signals, 1984's Grace Under Pressure, 1985's Power Windows, 1987's Hold Your Fire and the early 1989 double live A Show of Hands). What's cool about this boxed set is that all of the albums are packaged in miniature vinyl sleeves so it's just like buying the original vinyl albums all over again.<br />I don't need to rehash the reviews of these five albums again (if you want my opinion read the reviews of each one) but what I can say is that the sonic quality on this box set is incredible. Unlike the first two box sets, this box set was not defective though there are alternate mixes of some of the Hold Your Fire tracks (\\"Time Stand Still\\" has extra drums, \\"Mission\\" has some strings I never heard, extra chimes on \\"Tai Shan\\" and a few other surprises).<br />The album remixed in 5.1 on this box set is 1982's Signals. Richard Chycki did a great job remixing this album (like he did with Moving Pictures earlier in 2011). On \\"Subdivisions\\", \\"Analog Man\\" and (heck) the whole album sounds great and I heard parts not on the original 1982 mix which has been seemingly forever in my brain since 1990 so I heard some new vocal deliveries and instrument parts which were not on the original mix due to the constraints of vinyl. \\"The Weapon\\" actually has some extra bits of music not on the original stereo mix plus \\"Losing It\\" has a few seconds extra on playout not on original mix.<br />Also, the packaging is incredible with the miniature vinyl sleeves plus a booklet with great pictures and album credits and also each disc's box looks like part of a roadcase and the spine of Sector 2 has a 1982 era picture of Neil Peart.<br />Sector 3 (like the two Sector box sets aside this) by Rush is a must own and if you want to replace your 1997 remasters and/or the MFSL I say go for it.<br />RECOMMENDED!lbum sounds great and I heard parts not on the original 1982 mix which has been seemingly forever in my brain since 1990 so I heard some new vocal deliveries and instrument parts which were not on the original mix due to the constraints of vinyl. \\"The Weapon\\" actually has some extra bits of music not on the original stereo mix plus \\"Losing It\\" has a few seconds extra on playout not on original mix.<br />Also, the packaging is incredible with the miniature vinyl sleeves plus a booklet with great pictures and album credits and also each disc's box looks like part of a roadcase and the spine of Sector 2 has a 1982 era picture of Neil Peart.<br />Sector 3 (like the two Sector box sets aside this) by Rush is a must own and if you want to replace your 1997 remasters and/or the MFSL I say go for it.<br />RECOMMENDED!
0156030306|5.0|The award winning (Hugo and Nebuola Award) novel Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is about a lonely mentally handicapped man named Charlie Gordon who works in a bakery as a janitor. The book follows him through his life during an operation and his adventures after. During his journey he meets Algernon the only individual he can identify with because Algernon had the same operation.<br /><br />The book is written in a series of reports documenting the day to day life of Charlie, which makes it very manageable and compelling to read even if you only have a few minutes. This style of writing also allows you to empathize with Charlie throughout the whole story due to the fact you have insight into what he is feeling and experiencing. The book deals with the themes of loneliness, finding out who you are, where you came from, and behavior. If you have any interest in what it means to be human; you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for a science fiction novel with flashy characters and futuristic environments, this is not the book you are looking for. It is about the human condition and about the struggles people face.<br /><br />There are some sparsely placed religious conversations and scenes of a sexual nature that may offend some people.<br /><br />I thought Flowers for Algernon was an excellent read because it had many life lessons. The quotation, \\"A simple idea. Trust myself,\\" is very important to anyone, having faith in what you are doing is vital for success. The report style of writing makes it very easy to read and I would often find myself saying just one more report, then I will do something else.<br /><br />The book leaves you with many questions: Does intelligence hinder happiness? Would Charlie have been better off without the operation? What will the rest of his life be like?<br /><br />Although this book is fifty years old it is still perfectly valid. This resistance to the passage of time makes it a true classic in my opinion. I would recommend this book to anyone and if you read it before as a teenager, perhaps it is time you revisit it.

B008EQIK90|1.0|This has to be one of the worse movies out there at the moment. I wanted to like it, but was totally dissapointed. I never knew that they were letting teenagers write scripts in Hollywood. Every other word or phrase was like hanging out with a 13 year old. Come on guys grow up, you could have done so much better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this game alot because of all the different games in it i'm never bored! I like trying to beat every game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app. Works great on my phone and Kindle Fire. A great app for anyone looking to be able to read scripture.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great its really fun. love love love it!!!!! I recommend it to anyone.!!!!! it would be better if you didn't have to unlock all the.games!!
B005NQ5LSC|4.0|The Legend Is Born is a pretty decent movie. It is not as good as the Donnie Yen versions, however, Donnie To is more then decent in the movie.<br /><br />The movie simply tends to drag a little bit. While I understand that this is a depiction of the life of an actual person, the story between Ip Man, his adopted brother, and Ip's wife was simply not that interesting. This is the drag on the movie.<br /><br />I loved Ip's real life son in the movie, plus it was nice to see Fan Siu Wong actually get a chance to show his skill in this movie, rather play a background actor.<br /><br />The martial arts throughout are top notch. Overall, the IP Man Series as been probably the best old school style martial arts films to have been released in a long time.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Both films were absolutely amazing in every aspect... I like the first film better than second only because of the shooting of the cat scene...the second film was great as well...loved the shoot out scenes..they both had action comedy and love...I would love to see a third moviie showing how they got out of prison and go on to help their community with its fight against a big powerful biker gang or something different from the Mafia ...it was disappointing to see the movie end with them in prison..would like to see maybe how the lived their childhood and to shed some light on their super close relationship with each other and never any women..
B005LAIGLO|4.0|I watched this movie over the weekend. My review would only add to those who walked away liking this flick. Even my wife who cannot stand action/suspense loved this movie. She said the suspense was killing her...LOL!<br /><br />The movie had many twists and turns.  Wahlbergs character (Chris Farraday) simply did not want to get pulled back into a life of crime again, but at each turn you can feel him get pulled deeper and deeper into it.<br /><br />Acting may not have been the best, but this movie definitely keeps you interested until the end. Its not really a full on action movie. It is a part action part suspense movie. The combination works throughout.<br /><br />Not sure how folks give this a low rating. If you do not like suspense and action...why even bother watching.<br /><br />Another good movie from Wahlberg.
0767812387|3.0|I thought this film was absolutely adorable..I love watching movies that can be so exciting and heartfelt at the same time...I'm a big fan of Kris Kristofferson and Vanessa Williams so it was an easy choice for me...I liked the fact that someone from a different country could change the lives of everyone he met just by being himself ...all in all it is a good family friendly movie that is a joy to watch..
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this has been a fun game so far...just got started. seems like it's going to be addictive. kinda like farmville.
B007MDB71O|5.0|There is very few films that are this fun, while the movie is flawed the flaws are easy to overlook. The film doesnt take itself too seriously, and I was never bored while watching it. I desperately hope that there is a sequel in the works.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I'm guessing that tons of ppl have played this game before they ordered it as a free demo. I think this game can be addictive at times especially when u go to a new level and fail. then u try again and again &amp; again to get to the next level. anyways I got this game free cause I bought something thru amazon and I would buy this game if I had to.
0606259090|3.0|I had heard a lot of hype about this book so decided to start the series and wow, I am so glad I did!  This book kept me intrigued with its various sex scenes and innocent to bad girl story plot.  The only concern I had was the many grammatical errors.  This book was very poorly edited and for that, it gets less stars from me.  With better editing this book and series would be phenomenal, but the many errors make it seem like someone wrote it and published it in the same day without even reading it to themselves.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It kills time easily. Some games like Serenade are easy but others are hard. I really enjoy the whole app. thank you creators of this app!!!
0071762345|5.0|I read this book as part of the Pepperdine MALT graduate program. The book is very well written with some great cases of social media successes and failures.    The best take away for me was the emphasis on being authentic and using stories from the organization to share with the fans that \\"like\\" you in order to engage and educate them about the organization.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I was somewhat hesitant to buy this bottle cutter due to some negative reviews, but decided to go for it anyway.  It was a great decision because it's really quite easy to use.  After watching one video on YouTube [...] and reading the instructions, I was able to do a nearly perfect cut my first time.  I definitely recommend using the boiling/cold water technique to break the bottle after scoring it with the cutter.  Definitely a neat tool!
0062082353|5.0|This is an excellent book if you are into military readings. Starts out somewhat dry -as many books  do- but then picks up steam.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed this final book in the Hunger Games triology, but it didn't keep my interest as much as the first two books did.  I really enjoyed the first two so this one was a little bit of a let down and it didn't meet my expectations for the ending.
B007HP2KK4|1.0|[[ASIN:B007HP2KK4 Immortals 3D (3D Blu-ray / 2D Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) (Blu-ray)]]<br /><br />This movie was not 1 hour & 50 minutes as advertised. Instead it was 1 hour & 42 minutes. It also was not the same Version I saw in the Cinema. In my opinion it is probably the same Version rated PG15 that is also 1 hour & 42 minutes sold in the UK.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty cool game... Helps kill time. Some of the banes will try to outdo you but they're not that good.
0439023513|5.0|Loved all of the books of this series. Several enjoyable hours of reading, being lost in the story. Now I may go see the movie. I wanted to read the books first, to see if they stay true to the story line.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it is a nice app for the kindle! I didn't think it would be like this it tells weather good
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|This was a very good buy, very helpful. I wanted to make sure that I had a power cord no matter where I was. At home, traveling and at the office.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Like many people, I fell in love with the song, \\"We are young\\", after hearing it on Glee. Then, a few weeks ago I heard \\"Some Nights\\" on the radio & INSTANTLY loved it. I literally played the song a hundred times over the next week on Youtube. I figured if I love the song that much, I should get the whole album, and I have to say it is one of the best albums I have heard in a really long time. At first, a couple of the songs we're odd, and didn't seem the style I enjoy, for instance the over-auto tuned \\"Stars\\", but I found myself singing along to it, and then I became a fan of the song itself. I would have to say my favorite songs on the album are \\"Some Nights, \\"Carry On\\" and \\"Why am I the One\\".  I have yet to listen to Fun.'s first album, but I plan on downloading it.  I would definitely recommend the album to anyone who enjoys great music! Even my 10 year old daughter loves the music on this record!
B00846REIS|5.0|I LOVED the characters in this book just as much as I loved Christian and Anastasia from 50 Shades of Grey! Yummy, quick read...great for the beach or right before your man comes home!! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book, I would recommend to anyone. If you liked the first book, you'll love the second! Also check out the third, mickingjay!
B00005JM02|5.0|Movie came promptly, and my 19 mth old loves it! I couldn't wait until Disney releases it on blu ray in Dec ( we hit disneyworld in aug), so I decided to buy the regular copy. Works great!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a very good game. it plays well and it has lots of variety in layouts and colors. I also liked that it is timed.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Go ahead, read it....and then pursue what you will. I was inspired by this extrodinary search of such a simple and meaningful concept.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|why me! inreallynwantnthis app but i am kinda broke in cash lying around. but as soon as i hve 7bucks you bet ill buy thi it looks totaly beast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is an easy, fun way to pass the time! :) Quick gameplay and cute graphics, too. It's a perfect training game for grocery baggers, Imo. ;)
1933952806|5.0|This book is written in an \\"easy to understand\\" way. It includes lots more than just \\"how to do it\\".<br />It provides much insight into the D7000.
B000YAA68C|5.0|\\"Watch it with a box of Tissues\\"<br />Hillary Swank plays Holly, Gerald Butler plays Gerry, an American woman that falls in love and marries an Irishman. Gerry and Holly's love is wonderful but Gerry dies of a brain tumor. Gerry knowing his wife knows that she needs help and a little push to get over his death and move on. Gerry sends Holly letters to help her do that, making her do things she wouldn't normally do. Each letter is signed P.S. I Love You.<br /><br />I loved this movie, started off a little slow, but the wonderful man I married (who I secretly wish had that Irish accent) watched it with me. Total chick flick, but a real man can watch it too. I loved the romance that played out the ending was great, tears flowed and smiles, and laughter!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|words cannot explain how thrilled I am that this game is on the kindle! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME!!!! great game to play anytime and if you have a stylus it's even better!
B001D09OAI|5.0|This is one of our favourite movies. It is funny, yet is show cases human differences and relationships in a funny, non emotional way. Definitely a great movie.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|It was intriguing, but I honestly got tired of trying to follow the plot of good guys versus bad buys.  Exactly who was who?  I half expected them to all change clothes and become the other person at the end.  Maybe I'm used to the Daniel Silva, Nelson De Mille action books where you pretty much know from the start who the heroes are versus villains.  The only mystery there is how they will finally track the evil empire and end it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love the different options and live events. appreciate this app, just wish it were a little easier to navigate to different passages.
B0086700CM|5.0|dangerous game for insomniacs...keeps me up for hours! very addicting, one must say. make sure you have a lot of time before begininhg the game.
B002U6CJO2|4.0|This movie is an HD update from the 1995 version of the classic sci-fi anime flick, Ghost in the Shell. While I appreciate a lot of what the production team restored, some of the charm of the original is lost in the HD updates. Some of the updates include 3D renders that weren't present in the original release. These 3D models are usually helicopters, vehicles and the like, but at points it presents characters in 3D, and I feel that it takes away from the beautifully hand-drawn characters. If that doesn't bother you, than I highly recommend this movie.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I actually expected the movie to be a little better given the quality of the actors but it's still enjoyable to watch and well worth having the DVD.
B005LAIGSC|3.0|The Blu-ray / DVD itself was in great shape.  The movie itself, however, was not great.  The movie plays a bit like Training Day meets Man On Fire, but with CIA agents.  It drags a bit longer than it should.  However, this is plenty of action and Reynolds and Denzel do their best to keep things interesting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun to play. I enjoy enlarging the community and seeing all the characters from the movie.
1596061669|5.0|I read everything. Carlos Zafon has me in a spell. I wait for his next book with great anticipation. I have never been more spellbound than with Mr Ruiz Zafon's writings. THE ANGELS GAME and THE SHADOW OF THE WIND havent enjoyed anything like it in years. If I had a choice of any author, movie star, famous anyone I could meet in person it would be this very incredibly talented and interesting writer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a wonderful end to a great trilogy. Could hardly put the book down.  I really enjoyed the 3rd book the best.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games offer a huge variety of challenges and fun.  I can not believe they give you so much for free. Love it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this book.  I was looking for an author that I haven't heard of.  I just clicked on this basically because it was the first one.  I'm glad I did, this book keeps me reading I don't want to put it down, and its full of surprises!  I will be looking for more books my Gillian!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I was playing it I want a pic I erased on accident but it wont let me get the pic back still a really good game. that's the only down side on this game you should get this game and it has really nice pictures but some r umm very odd that is way I'm giving it 5 stars
B005J7K964|1.0|This is a complete and super rip off for anyone looking to own a good quality copy of the Moroder version of this film.  Instead of going back to the higher quality new found elements and re-colorizing this film, they apparently just went ahead and shipped out the junky old version from 1984.  There is a better, much cleaner version of this film online (albeit unauthorized by the studio) by a guy online by the name of 'Gilchrist'.  I wish like heck the studio would have the brains to team up with the guy.  But of course, they won't.  BTW: menu on this Blu-Ray seems half baked too.<br /><br />The good part of this though is being able to see a copy of the documentary regarding the making of the film.  While not very inspirational, it's still refreshing to see there is additional elements for the hardcore fan of this movie.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|if you want to live your dream life dont waste any time you are on the right way may the joy be with all of you read the most magical book that has ever been written
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The story was wonderful and full of lots of twits and turns.  I love how the ending didn't leave readers hanging, and the turmoil throughout it leaves room for another book.  I hope there is an additional book for the series because Travis and Abby work well together.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|a very poorly crafted book aimed at the lowest common denominator and spiced with sex to sell. The hype far outweighed the product. definitely what i would class as a trashy novel! after the first book you are compelled to read the second to see if it gets any better sadly it doesn't.<br />very reminiscent of the twilight series in that you wonder how the heroine managed to live that long and be that naive.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is the greatest Bible app out there! It has any translation you can think of and in all languages. The only flaw that I've experience is being unable to use the app properly  without a wifi connection. Besides that, it's great!
0385344228|3.0|OK - not the best book. Wouldn't read it unless was for my book club. Ending was unexpected. Felt for the parents.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun games. recommended for all. my kids even play the games. and it's a fun way to pass time. haven't had any trouble at all. kindle fire
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great game, easy for beginners but lots of challenges keep it fresh. I would recommend this for pretty much anyone that likes puzzle games or golf.
B005IQZB14|4.0|As an avid reader, I've come to realize that my impressions of a book are often driven by the situation in my life at the time that I read it.  Cheryl Strayed's book came at a perfect time for me.  I read it about two months after losing a parent, and I very much connected with her grief.  While I don't predict that I'll go hike the PCT as part of my grieving process, I really lost myself in her story.  She made me laugh, made me cry, and made me realize that life does go on after a big loss even though we never truly make up for the gaps in our lives and hearts when someone we love is gone.  Thank you for your story, Cheryl. I needed it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this, but instead it blew me away.  A page turner, kept me awake way past my bedtime.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite authors.  I find her funny, witty, and most of all her characters are realistic in my world.  Poppy is so much like some women I've known that I have put a composite face to her in my mind.  She is sweet and non-confrontational and gets walked on a few times here and there, but she doesn't want to rock the boat unnecessarily.  I feel like that most of the time.  Sam on the other hand is all business without a lot of personality to match until you get to know him.  I love the way the author describes his smile, this real smile he shares only rarely.  The two together are a delightful mix and the texting is a great addition for this day and age.<br /><br />The crazy life that Poppy has is her doing and she knows it.  She is a normal person thrown into the deep end of a life she never asked for or expected(after only a few weeks of dating.)  She finds herself in need and the needed item appears and WOW...there goes her life with the twists and turns that make this author so enjoyable to read.  Chick-lit at its finest- in my opinion.<br /><br />Romance in this book is great, not a lot of sex, just a few suggestions that it was had and enjoyed by all that had it.  I cried at the end...just a happy sap I am at times.  I love books like this...great characters, crazy situations, comedy and drama mixed in unequal yet complementary parts.  This is a cute, fast read well worth your time.  Sophie Kinsella is an author well worth looking into.  I look forward to her next and the next one after that...it is always a joy to pick up her newest and lose myself for a few hours.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is berry fun because I downlouded it it was free this game is going straight to my favs
0345803507|3.0|This trilogy has been quite a ride and book 3 is not much different from the other two content-wise...fights, sex and a little action (rolling eyes). However, the author does attempt to give a bit more insight into Chrtistians's past which helps the reader understand him a bit more. The ending is rather typical....sweet and happy but then it's a romance book...it's supposed to be that way. All in all...not a bad trilogy...definitely not perfect but tolerable.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I feel ambiguous about this book. It goes up and down in quality. On one hand precise and beautifully written parts on the scientific and historic side of the theme on the other hand the usual life-coaching, self help, bushwah.<br />The theme itself is of great interest even for a European like me. I learnt a lot on Introversion and it's value. It's only that the book seems to be written exclusively for an academic elite. Common people have no place in it, it feels like Mrs. Cain consequently refuses to take notice of a world apart of Wall Street meetings, Universities and courses for the wealthy.<br />As critical as the text comes up with the difficulties stemming from the social preference of extraverts in the USA so neglectant is it for the problem of social competition, it never questions the values of a society obsessed with rivalry.<br />The acknowledgements at the end of the book read like the directory of a mid-sized city. Maybe some sort of irony to mimic the absurdity of these thank-you-excesses? But I didn't get the funny part about it, I just felt annoyed.<br />The long list of editors and lectors explains too why I often had to smile about the exaggerated use of a Thesaurus. And maybe even the oscillating quality traces back to these too many hands writing and editing the lines.<br />Do I regret to have read the book? No!<br />Would I recommend it? No!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I think this is a fun game.  It's a great way to pass time when you have nothing important to do.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|Great songs reminiscent of Rage in Eden and Lament.  Traditional Ultravox sound!  Worth purchasing!  First cd with the four members since 1984!  Wow!  I love these guys!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very addicting! kept me entertained for hours! its a fast moving game and easy to level up. just watch out that you don't accidentally buy stuff
B00846REIS|1.0|Bared to You by Sylvia Day was recommened to me by some friends after we finished reading the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. Bared to You was basically a watered down version of FSoG. I had to force myself to finish reading it.<br /><br />The relationship between Eva and Gideon seemed unbelievably forced and completely awkward. There is no back story to why Gideon acts the way he does or feels the need to \\"possess\\" Eva. These two are so dysfunctional and immature, that they should probably complete counseling apart before they even considered couples counseling after dating for a week.<br /><br />I don't think I will be purchasing the next book when it comes out in October.
0345803485|5.0|I read all books in the trilogy.<br />Very erotic and I think a wonderful love story.<br /><br />I sure did enjoy reading these.<br /><br />Lee
0374275637|3.0|I am not finished with the reading but first impressions are positive. It is interesting to see how some \\"taken for granted\\" thininkg patterns function in real and this book reveals some new perspective on our thinking processes...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game along with the movie! they are the best ever! so that us pretty much all ibyave to say byeee
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Puchased for my daughter who is a huge Pretty Little Liars fan.  She enjoyed watching the second season and can't wait for season three to come out.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|*****DON'T WORRY, NO SPOILERS HERE*****<br /><br />i honestly don't understand what the fuss about this book is. i found a lot of the writing to be trite and boring. let me explain-<br /><br />there are two voices simultaneously telling their stories- one of a girl, on tape, who committed suicide, and the other of a boy listening to her tapes. the problem with this set-up was that the reader really couldn't get into both stories at once. for me, the girls' story was much more intriguing than the boys', who mostly just reacts to the tapes with headaches and \\"knots in his stomach.\\" i suppose if i were a preteen, this might not feel so contrived, but as a twenty-something who has read much more brilliant young adult writing (such as those of author john green), i found this book's treatment of teenagers to be vastly disappointing. it really dumbs them down.<br /><br />the other major problem with the book was that hannah (the suicidal girl on the tapes) comes off as whiny and overly sensitive. growing up as a depressed and suicidal girl myself, i thought i would be able to relate to hannah, but instead i found her to be incessantly obnoxious and frankly, stupid. she had no redeeming qualities, and therefore it was hard for the reader to sympathize and support her. it is no surprise that i read that the author was not a suicidal girl herself, and frankly, if the author cannot empathize, than how can she get the reader to?? the author stated that she consulted with a friend who had depression issues at that age- this also is not helpful- i think being too far removed from the time period, it is much harder to capture those feelings- it might have been better if the author researched by talking to teens going through depression right now.<br /><br />hannah gives 13 reasons on 13 tapes for why she decided to kill herself. the reasons she gives (such has being harassed by guys) are menial and really a part of growing up a woman. because she is so self-involved that she doesn't ever see beyond herself (to understand that this happens to every girl), and because she never stands up for herself, or for others, it is impossible to root for her.<br /><br />all in all, i found the message of the book to be a bad one-- it is so rare to have wonderful female protagonists to get behind, and this book seems to be another excuse not to want one. the only reason i finished the book at all was in the hopes that it would redeem itself with a fulfilling ending. it really did not. it was simplistic, and i truly regret paying $9.99 for it.<br /><br />for a better understanding of depression/suicide in young people, i'd recommend Elizabeth Wurtzel's [[ASIN:B000SBNU30 PROZAC NATION]] or the demure, yet still important [[ASIN:B000F9RK5Y Like the Red Panda (Harvest Book)]].
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Use this keyboard on both phone and tablet. Love that you can change the size of the keys to suit your device, hence the use on both devices. Another feature that makes this keyboard a keeper are the arrow keys. The fact that they were removed in the most recent update is the ONLY reason I will not update, and won't until they return. The ability to move through what you have typed, and make corrections on the fly is a key feature, and made this a standout app.<br />PLEASE add back the directional arrows!
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I have had my eye on this model for awhile; and since I cannot afford a Rolex Submariner right now, I pulled the trigger on the Seiko diver. After extensive research on this model and hearsay on the watch forums, I can say that this model is quite durable and keeps time exceptionally better than I expected. It is always within 1 minute of my iPhone. The lume is fantastic, and lasts throughout the night (although it is fairly dim in the morning). The bezel feels solid enough, and the 12 o'clock marker lines up perfectly on chapter lines of the dial. I have heard this is not always the case. I have worn it to the beach a few times, and sand does get under the bezel. The solution is to rinse well with water and turn the bezel gently. I have had no problems otherwise. I purchased a NATO and Zulu strap for it (black) and they serve to change the look a little bit. The stainless steel \\"Jubilee\\" bracelet is elegant looking, but I can agree with other reviewers about its \\"flimsiness.\\" I don't mind it however. I will add that this is my daily wear watch along with my G-Shock G9000-1V, and it has not ran out of charge, so I cannot attest to its longevity. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and it will still remain in my collection when I do acquire a Submariner someday.

0143039431|4.0|The great depression was an unrelenting harsh time in American history where many families starved to death just trying to provide for their families. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent book that depicts one families struggle during this time. John Steinbeck executed and wrote this story very well. He truly is an amazing author, descriptive and precise, capable of creating mood and atmosphere that makes you feel as though you are a member of the family throughout the entire story. Steinbeck is not only socially and politically observant of the times; he also adds depth to his story by depicting the conditions that the people lived in, and describing the desires of not just individuals, but the nation during the struggle of the great depression, after the dust bowl. The story is an epic tale of one Oklahoman family and their forced migration west.  After having their farm and home foreclosed on by the bank, the Joads are forced to leave the only home they have ever known.  With word that there is work out west they are forced to make their trek across the country to survive.  Even though it happened almost eighty years ago, The Grapes of Wrath is reminiscent of what is happening now in politics.  With such a large gap between the wealthy and the poor there is a sense that all people want is a fair chance in this book. I would recommend this The Grapes of Wrath to anyone who has interests in politics, history, or social sciences.  John Steinbeck has a very good understanding of these and even makes a few suggestions on ideas that he thought were good and later came to be( Like rotating crops in farming, the formation of unions, and other regulations that were put into place after the great depression). John Steinbeck demanded that a full copy of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" be put in the first edition of his book.  It contains the line \\"He is stomping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\\" Which Of course is where he got the title for his book; also it captures the essence of his writing. If you are looking for a good fictional read, that is informative about the way people lived during the great depression, then this is the book for you.also it captures the essence of his writing. If you are looking for a good fictional read, that is informative about the way people lived during the great depression, then this is the book for you.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I found it really hard to score this book. On the one hand, it is very badly written. I found the overuse of the term 'Oh my,' irritating, to say the least. The constant descriptives of the male MC long fingers were equally as frustrating. I get that you are talking about his nether regions!<br /><br />However, this author has done the same thing Twilight achieved. And I'm not talking about being a best seller. I mean that she has managed to convey a base emotion so well that people can't put this book down. I wanted to give her five stars for that alone.<br /><br />This book is good, but you have to let go of your inner editor to thoroughly enjoy it.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Syncs well with Google Calendar, able to customize widget to show the information I want to be able to see at a glance. The month view also gives you the option of seeing the actual text description for your events, not just an icon or tab indicating an event, and you must click on that day to actually see what is scheduled. That was the main reason I chose this app.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|Once again, this one is hard to score. I found there was less sex in this book - and what was there certainly couldn't be considered 'darker' than in the first book. The writing is much better in this novel, but the story line seems to be lacking. This book seems to be suffering from classic middle child syndrome - it is neither cute enough to be the youngest or as precious as the first born. I did enjoy it however, but only in hindsight. It was the bridge that got me from the first book to the more interesting last one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beautifully written, and lots of unexpected twisting plots. The author has amazing skills; she put great effort writing this novel. highly recommended!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|This final book in the Fifty Shades trilogy is by far my favourite - not that I was expecting it to be.<br /><br />Right from the start of the series, while I loved reading them, I was quite annoyed at the implication that only weirdos and damaged individuals were capable of being into the BDSM scene. I was expecting to find the culmination of this book to get right under my skin since I knew we would finally find out about what happened to Christian as a child and why he was this way inclined.<br /><br />And yes, we do find out what happened to him. The author, however, kept the BDSM theme going beyond the realisation of his past. It was nice to see that by his ownership of past atrocities he did not give up the sex life we loved these books for.<br /><br />Congratulations E.L. James!
0345803485|5.0|I've read the whole trilogy now. I think everyone who is married or in a relationship should have to read this book. My boyfriend loves it and hasnt even read it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I understand why this book is considered a bestseller - as far as erotic fiction goes, this book is quite good!  There are times when the same description or phrase is used a little repetitively, but I didn't think it detracted from the story itself.  It was also very clearly written by a woman for women (sorry guys).  However, I don't believe this book deserves a one or two star rating.  It isn't a book that requires a lot of thinking while you read it, but is an easy and quick read that would be best read poolside or on the beach with a cocktail or two.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This book is not going to be some great literary classic, but for an enjoyable, quick, summer read that doesn't require a lot of \\"thought\\", this book is great!  However, if you aren't a fan of reading graphic sex scenes, stay clear, this book isn't for you.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had read another title recently that garnered a lot of reviews on Amazon. While the concept was interesting I found the plot predictable and the writing weak and sophomoric. Enough about that lame book...the Wool books are awesome!<br /><br />I bought the Omnibus collection to read during a recent holiday break and ended up burning through all five stories in two days! The sixth book I read the next day and now I am ready for more! I enjoy the author's writing style and find these stories to be very engaging. I haven't been this swept up in a series since Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" books. I will probably check out some of his other works!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading all three books, I was still enjoying page after page, and supprise after supprise.What supprised me the most was an ending I liked and could live with.  If you decide to read this triogy, make sure you read all three, and in order.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|As a first time videographer, I bought this mic based on the recommendations of other Amazon consumers and the price was hard to beat compared to what the video store recommended ($200+). I used this for my first Youtube video with a Canon Vixia HF M500 video camera and the audio was really great. I would have given it five stars, but it doesn't have a light to indicate when the mic is on or off. For the price, you can't beat it.
0374275637|5.0|before I touch the topic about this book, I am really satisfied with the condition of the book when I received it. I was happy that it was not damaged and that it was my money's worth. ultimately, the book got into my hands rather than being addressed to someone else.<br /><br />About the book,<br /><br />The author is super-genius in the field of psychology and I saw that clearly in his book. This book answers the questions that deal with our mind. It has taught me a lot on how humans perceive things around them consciously and unconsciously. Sometimes, we are are prey of our own mind and this book can help turn things around. This book is really informative and I suggest that it should be read by others as well.<br /><br />Daniel Kahneman addresses how people's mind are often influenced by many factors such as biases, representatives and most of the time the LAZY-ness of people to take time to rethink and or analyze the situation. Not knowing how to deal with psychological situations cause people to perform less efficiently and sometimes be prey to those who utilize psychological warfare.<br /><br />Before I bought this book, I only read the finite teaser of this book. I decided to give it a try and ordered it from Malaysia. The book came to me 1 month later and I would like to express that it has been worth the wait.
B00005J6UP|5.0|For all who want the best movies for the best price. I got all the information I needed before I purchased the movie \\"The Goonies\\". The DVD was stated to be in Very Good condition but was actually \\"perfect\\" & I recieved it sooner than anticipated. I couldn't have enjoyed it more, and for almost just pennies. The guarantee is a plus, which made my ordering choice easier & I'll continue ordering my favorites here.

B007SGM084|1.0|I (unfortunately) wasted $30 on this horrible trilogy. The writing is atrocious (the same boring thoughts over and over again), the plot line is lame and predictable, and there really isn't even all that much hot kinky goodness that it's hyped for having. Do yourself a favor and get the first book to see what all the fuss is about, but DO NOT waste the money on all three books.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Downloaded on Kindle Fire, and it works perfectly, but for two things. When I close the app, and it isn't doing anything, then it makes me force close the app the next time I try to search for a video. And when I download a video as a song, they all have the same picture, which is the first song I downloaded. Other than those 2 things, the app works perfectly. And as a tip to Kindle Fire users downloading a video as a song, you click the magnifying glass, search for the video, long click it, click download as mp3, and when it finishes downloading, you click the video in notifications, and it will show up in your music tab. I don't know if everyone has to do it, but I have to in order to find the song in my music tab.

B0013ND30W|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is one of the most ambitious animated films ever made. It took Walt Disney the entire 50's decade to finish it and the final results where both breathtaking and different from anything that was done before or after. Sleeping Beauty is truly a class-apart film.<br /><br />From its detailed and lush backgrounds, its defined characters, superb score and intense action, Sleeping Beauty is a true classic that offers very high quality entertainment. The plot might be thin and predictable but its truly a joy to watch. The characters are very well delineated and you invest and care for them. Many critics have said that the heroine is a very passive girl with not much to do or say but I think it serves the story right as the big stars here are the three fairies and Maleficent who carried the picture in a wonderful way.<br /><br />Sleeping Beauty has been always lovely to look at but now in this BD is something truly spectacular!!<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Sleeping Beauty was the first hand-drawn animated film to debut on BD from Disney and the results are truly wonderful. The detail, the colors, the contrast everything is so clear and clean that you will want to see it again and again. Also, there are not any traces of banding, artifacts and other distractions. Simply amazing!<br /><br />The restored audio is offered via a 7.1 DTS-HD MA and is just glorious! There are no distortions and directionality is spot-on. A demo worthy experience from a 53 year old film.<br /><br />Bonus Material<br /><br />Sleeping Beauty comes in a 2-disc set and comes fully loaded with wonderful bonus features:<br /><br />In Disc 1 you have the movie, a cine-explore feature, an audio commentary, The Grand Canyon Documentary and some games.<br /><br />Disc 2 comes with a making of documentary, alternate opening, games, deleted music, The Peter Tchaikovski story, a tribute to Eyvind Earle, galleries, publicity and more.<br /><br />Everything is very informative and a must-see.<br /><br />A DVD of the film is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br /><br />Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's most iconic classic and is certainly its most lavish and opulent one. With breathtaking scenarios, a great story, wonderful music and wonderful characters, Sleeping Beauty is a must-own film. This BD is absolutely spectacular with top-notch picture and sound and lots of excellent bonus material. Highly Recommended!!/><br />A DVD of the film is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br /><br />Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's most iconic classic and is certainly its most lavish and opulent one.

0307730697|5.0|Fearless is a book much like Outlaw Platoon in that it is a story about one of our military heroes--and that the story contained within it's pages is one that is unequivocally incredible. It is the inspiring true story of Navy SEAL Adam Brown, a man who made some bad decisions early on in his life, but rose above those choices and continued to fight--and conquer--his personal demons to become a man truly worth looking up to. It is a book about second chances, patriotism, love that never gave up, and--most of all--faith. Adam Brown's extraordinary life was an incredible--albeit difficult--journey from utter hopelessness to a life that was filled with purpose.<br /><br />Right from the start this book pulls you in and makes it very hard to have to put it down to attend to other things. I remember laughing out loud at one point in the beginning of the book when the author, Eric Blehm, was illustrating what Brown had been like as a toddler--the similarity to my own son and the understanding of how his mother must have felt each time he did something outlandish gave me some common ground with the story and drew me deeper into it's pages. Brown's never-quit attitude (despite seemingly impossible odds on more than one occasion) made me examine my own attitudes when faced with not-anywhere-near-as-impossible of odds.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, but the title of the book truly sum's up Brown's life in a single word--from the start of his life to his final breath--he truly was fearless. Brown overcame adversity time and time again that others would have never dared to challenge. His deep convictions and unwillingness to quit despite the odds being stacked against him on many different occasions led to his becoming a part of the legendary SEAL Team Six.<br /><br />Eric Blehm did a fabulous job in retelling Brown's story. His style of writing and story telling truly draws you in and helps you envision the events he retold as you read them. May Brown's story never be forgotten, and to GOD be the glory!<br /><br />WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group kindly provided me with a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Funny, surprising, touching, quirky, flippant, action-filled, downright amazing - Firefly is all that and heaven on a stick. Why, oh why, didn't the American public take this vastly excellent and shiny series unto their collective hearts?<br /><br />I recently re-watched all 14 episodes and positively wept when it ended. No more Firefly (well, except for the Serenity film, which I've yet to see). No more Zoe, Wash, Jayne, Kaylee, Simon, Book, or River. Did Malcolm and Inara ever get together? Sigh, I want to go back in time and twist some Fox Network executive's arm to continue the series.<br /><br />Drat.
1451626657|4.0|If you like M*A*S*H*, I'm betting you will probably like Catch-22.  Heller takes you on an absurd ride through Captain Yossarian's time at the Air Force camp in Pianosa - showing the tragedy of war from the facet of what it does to those who engage in it. Chapter by chapter, you meet characters for whom the heat of war has further fractured the cracks and fault lines in their souls - from young men who go crazy trying to keep themselves sane, to opportunists who take advantage of the most ridiculous circumstances, to generals and colonels who play power games simply to indulge in their own power.<br /><br />What Heller's book shows us, when we laugh at the characters and their actions, is that we are not so different from this lunatic cast - that our own offices, churches, and homes are filled with the same characters and the same flaws.  Some of those characters and flaws are funny, and some are downright frightening - but none of them is without critique.  We are all cracked and we will all shatter - the only hope is escape.<br /><br />Heller's book is unapologetically escapist.  When you see the world as an absurd series of events, there is little else to do but escape.  If you become a part of that landscape, you lose yourself.  Yossarian, the protagonist, refuses to let himself completely melt into the canvas of the scene that is painted around him and seeks a way out. In the life of a Christian, this way out is Christ - the escape for sinners who would rather not go on sinning, even though they have already done so and have broken themselves and others in that process.  Heller does not paint Yossarian's escape so clearly, but does give us hope that Yossarian will escape.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book for the most part.  It was a little dense reading at times, but well worth the time spent in finishing it.  I hope you'll enjoy it as well.

0316023744|5.0|This is the third big study of WWII I have read in the last three years, and the ending is the same each time.  That's the problem with non-fiction.  On the other hand, you do learn new ways of looking at things you already know, so there is that.  I can't really split this from Max Hastings Inferno or Andrew Roberts Storm of War/Masters and Commanders.  All books are just superb works that will stand the test of time.  This has the best narative flow, perhaps, but there is a little more analysis in the other works, and certainly this is less unhappy than Hastings brutal retelling of the events of 1939-1945.<br /><br />What Beevor does better than those other two is explore the war in China: perhaps he even does this better than Hastings \\"Retribution\\" about the Pacific War.  But, apart from the Battle of Khalkin Gol in early 1939, when the Soviets soundly defeated the Japanese, for the most part the rest of the War affected China, while events in China did not really affect the wider war.  You could make the case that Andrew Roberts basically one-page summary as \\"the Chinese tied up 1 million Japanese Army soldiers\\" is a fair summary of what Beevor covers at length.  Of course, that means you ignore a lot of suffering by the Chinese peasantry, which you cannot overlook in today's world, which is still largely shaped by WWII.<br /><br />In short, every theatre of war is covered in some degree of detail, together with how they all interrelated, and also with the machinations of Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler (and to a degree, de Gaulle).  If there is anything in particular I took away from this, its that Roosevelt was a bit of a prick: he appears completely amoral, apart from the big issue of war against Hitler and Tojo.  As a sideline to WWII, Roosevelt was focused on dismantling the British Empire, all the while ignoring the rise of the Soviet empire to an extent that must have been either deliberate or negligent.  But still, in the great scheme of WWII, the British lost less than most - certainly less than the the Jews, the Poles, or the Balts, or other nations of central Europe.<br /><br />I guess I have to say, read all of Roberts, Hastings and Beevor. All are great works and complement the other.  Beevor's books on the fall of Berlin, the battle of Stalingrad, and D-Day are also excellent.  If you have an interest in military history, this is a must read.he British lost less than most - certainly less than the the Jews, the Poles, or the Balts, or other nations of central Europe.<br /><br />I guess I have to say, read all of Roberts, Hastings and Beevor.

0762777931|5.0|Let me just state that my fiance borrowed this from the library and I had him recheck it out.  There is just too much information in here to digest quickly.  I took a nutrition class as part of my nursing classes.  I also was on a vegan diet after my juice cleanse.  I gave up.  I was eating too much and there was something I felt like I wasn't getting.  That's because I wasn't.  This is like an expansion on that class and I see where I was going wrong.  There were things in my diet that I was missing and I had quit juicing after the cleanse.  I currently have an awesome green juice (small chunk of ginger, one peeled lemon or lime, one apple, one or two cucumbers (depending on the size), one small bunch of parsley, one large bunch of Kale (I use veggie wash), and 4 large stalks of organic celery.  I drink it every morning.  I take a daily vitamin that had all my B Complex I needed and a D3 vitamin (I was deficient!).  I took her advice and found a great brand Blue Green Algae (Spirulina)that works for me *Buy it on Amazon* My gut needed some enzyme assistance and a good priobiotic (she tells you what to look for). I drink an aloe juice with water that helps in so many ways.  Waiting for Wheat grass to arrive as my final item to add to my diet.  I took this book with me to the grocery store and online to help in my search.  I'm not hungry.  I feel fantastic!  My stomach, intestine, joints, muscles are all feeling no pain and are thanking me! I am finally at peak quality and trust me when I say you can look at my list of ailments and see why at 36 years of age I needed this book.  Now the language may offend some of you.  At first I was a bit put off by it.  Then I just got used to it. I pretended she was a friend of mine offering me some wisdom in her own quirky way. She's inspiring to boot.  The medical team that supported this gave easy to understand information too.  So I bought the book.  Too much valuable info.  I changed my life in other ways too but I'm not ruining the book.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This album, like every LP album since MTM, is very polarizing for the fan-base.  Essentially LP switched from strictly nu metal to embrace some other styles, mixing in rock, pop-rock, pop, and electronica.  MTM was a slight step into the pop-rock area with a little bit of nu metal sounds of screaming and rap while ATS was a leap into electronica with traces of the screaming and rap of the early years.  This album seems like a step back from the ATS abyss (though I actually really loved ATS and think it is their best album for its progressiveness for the band and transcendent message).  It has some tastes of the electronica, some of the poppyness, some rock, and then some straight up moments of old LP.  For that I am grateful.  It's a nice marker album of where the band has been and perhaps a sign of where it's going.  It takes a little from every album and perhaps shows us the ecclectic path that this incredible band will take in the future.  With this in mind, try not to simply expect the same thing every time from these guys.  They've made their first albums, they and you have those songs in their library forever and they're not going anywhere.  Turn a fresh ear to the fresh things that the band is trying to do and perhaps allow yourself to grow with them.  Of course not everyone will love everything that comes along, but I for one hope that LP keeps mixing things up and trying to give the fans something that moves both them and others while pushing both forward musically, lyrically, and stylistically to places we haven't been before and that may be even better than that which came before.<br /><br />Most Notable songs:<br />Until it Breaks - A nice mix of soaring vocals and great rap by Shinoda.<br />Castle of Glass - You can really feel something with this song.  Hear the swelling beat and poignant lyrics.

1439148953|3.0|When I launched into reading Brooklyn, I was excited at the many promising themes with which I expected Colm Toibin to captivate my imagination.  This is, after all, a book about a young Irish girl, Eilis, who is forced to emigrate alone to America (Brooklyn, no less) to make a better life for herself!  There should defiance, sadness, loneliness, homesickness, coming-of-age, new discoveries, adventures, Brooklyn, America during the 1950's, segregation, ethnic nuances, inter-ethnic situations, and so much more!!! Now, let's be fair. The author may not be expected to address all these enticing angles, but from a book that was short-listed twice for a Booker Prize, I would think that a few would be undertaken.  Toibin did tickle my anticipation with mention of some of these themes, but they never amounted to anything but that! As I finished the book and pondered what I had read, I realized that I knew nothing more about Brooklyn from the eyes of an immigrant (or anyone else for that matter) and nothing new from Toibin about the immigrant's experience.  This book could have been anywhere in the USA and it could have been about a young girl leaving home in the mid-80's to go to another state.<br /><br />I should have been warned from the beginning of the book, by the author's manner of dealing with Eilis' departure.  Remember,  young Eilis  must leave the warmth and comfort of her mother and sister, to go across the ocean to a new country where she knows no one!  What a canvas on which the author can evoke heartbreak, longing, and struggle.  Yet Toibin does absolutely nothing with this.  The moments of Eilis' departure from her mother are not addressed at all! More frustrating for me, was the lengthy description of her seasickness, which could be in any book, during any time period, experienced by any protagonist!<br /><br />Had I not had expectations to broaden my understanding of an immigrant's experience or a desire to learn about the unique character of Brooklyn, I would have enjoyed this book more.  It could have been enjoyed as a coming-of-age story of a young girl with little worldliness, an easy-going temperament, and much help along the way.<br /><br />Once again, I am left to contemplate why some books are garnered much praise by the critics while receiving such low marks by readers...ould have enjoyed this book more.

1846467640|5.0|My 2 yr old daughter's favorite show is Peppa Pig, and she loves this little library! Some of the other Peppa items available for order are way expensive because of them being imported but this little set of books is affordable. My daughter is big on books anyway, and she especially loves books with peppa pig in them! They are small, simple little books but she loves opening these books up and seeing Peppa, George, Suzy sheep, and all the others. Great buy!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|GREAT ENDING TO A GREAT SERIES! COULD NOT PUT KINDLE DOWN UNTILE<br />I FINISHED READING IT. ONLY TOOK 2 DAYS WHICH IS PRETTY FAST FOR ME.
0345803493|1.0|Instead of writing and publishing book two, which I thought was entirely unnecessarily, E.L. James should have just written about their breakup (which you discover in book two lasted a whopping five days) from Christian's point of view, specifically how it changed him and what he discovered he wanted from Ana as a result.  I really enjoyed the change in point of view that happened in book three, reading from Christian's perspective.  It was a touch of Midnight Sun.  And it's really the ONLY redeeming quality about book three.  Then we could have read Ana's thoughts over those five days.  Then, Bella and Edward...oh, sorry...Ana and Christian could have gotten back together in the same way they did in book two and it should have ended there.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey, for as flawed and poorly written as it was, was interesting in that the subject matter is dark and taboo.  It was tantalizing.  It ends abruptly, presumably because the publishing company decided this needed to be turned into a trilogy, for no good reason other than to milk this series for as much money as possible.  Book two was boring and just weak.  It should have never been written.  Greed is the motivating factor behind putting this book into the world.  The author and publishing company could have just added 30 or so more pages to Grey and there would have been no need for Darker whatsoever.  Disappointing.  Why write three books--one which is mediocre and unnecessary (Darker), the other is just downright awful (Freed)--when you can write one really interesting book (Grey)?  Dollar, dollar bills, y'all.  Thank God I borrowed this book instead of buying it.

B007F1BQMS|2.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen this year. I had great expectation and been patiently waiting the DVD to arrive at my mail box. After watching it I just felt being robbed of 2 hours of my life. Seeing so many great actors in this movie really excited me, but the movie is just plain boring and such a disappointment. The storyline is so plain and weak, the characters totally lack of connection and no sparks between each couples whatsoever. The actors, being all A-list big names and all, played horribly like they didn't even care. The only one that actually caught my eye and was playing his role decently with efforts is Zac Efron. The others, including Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, were so bad like they didn't get paid making this movie. I thought Valentine's Day was bad enough, but New Year's Eve is just unbearable. If you want to watch a fun and romantic comedy with bunch of A list actors, I would recommend Love Actually. Skip this one unless you've got a lot time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Nice familiar fast paced fun. I am finding it much more entertaining than I thought it would be . Oregon Trail meets Farmville. :)
B0059XTUXQ|3.0|I gave this movie a 3-star for the amazing performance once again by Meryl Streep, portraying effortlessly the first and only female British Prime Minister Lady Thatcher. Before watching this movie I already knew I would totally enjoy her performance, winning an Oscar and all, and that part did not fail me. However, from someone who wants to learn more about Lady Thatcher and know everything about how she got to where she was as the Prime Minister as well as the things she's done for her country, good and bad, the movie fell short. I felt like I still didn't know her at all after the 2 hours movie, and I was watching Meryl Streep \\"playing\\" her the entire time, but not \\"knowing\\" the kind of person Lady Thatcher really is or what this movie is trying to convey (again, good an bad). And I think the movie focused way too much on the later part of Thatcher's life emphasizing her health issues which I don't think it's that much of a relevance and not what people wanted to watch this movie for. I wish it could be made a little bit differently portraying Thatcher as a political figure rather than just marveling at how good of an actor Meryl Streep is.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I originally bought right after reading wizards first rule since i had to know what happened, now I'm wishing i bougt a physical copy instead of kindle so i could skip ahead a bit easier. Still a good story, but right around the middle it's very hard to keep up with. The story line has split into three and each has gotten a bit long winded for my taste, repeating things over again to where I'm having to put it down more often than read. Still want to finish and try the third, but I think i will be more cautious on which version i buy.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|All the Glee CD's are wonderful and this one is no exception! Love the songs and different type of of music on this album.
B005974CNA|3.0|This may be late but I just felt like reviewing this almost a year after receiving day one of release.<br /><br />Dream Theater has always been an incredible band, and showed they can keep a similar passion and pace without Mike Pooltoys.  The album is significantly better than the last 2 Roadrunner releases, since all I heard were Rush(Tuscany), Cradle of Filth(Nightmare), and Evanescence(Forsaken) ripoffs with the occasional amazing melody line, but at what cost.  The album feels devoid of any creativity as they pulled a Metallica, along with many other bands, and looked back at their catalogue for inspiration.<br /><br />There has been a lot controversy about it being \\"Images and Words\\" part 2 and who can blame people.  I felt it the first time I heard \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" and was glad to see others noticed.  It's undeniable too, Jordan Headdress copies Michael Moore's key sound on a few tracks.  But enough of that.<br /><br />My main complaint is Mr. Man Genie.  His drum parts are decent and he tries hard to emulate Portnoy... I mean Pooltoys, but doesn't do justice.  A phenomenal player with incredibly impressive chops he may be, but his style of play is more suited for more simply structured music, such as his Steve Vai work.  The fluid play style of MP that meshed so perfectly is missing.<br /><br />I saw them live twice with Man's Genies in tow and was disappointed with the way he interpreted the back catalogue.  He dumbed down a lot of parts but I understand, he is still new and hasn't lived the music fully since MP has 25 years on him.  I still will complain because I've seen Portcall jump into random projects or shows and play perfect with his style intact.<br /><br />This review went off track a bit and I could go on and on about inaequate aspects of the album, but I'll conclude.  This album is a good addition to the DT play list with amazing tracks like \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" and decent radio hits such as \\"Build Me Up\\".  This is definitely great for new fans as it contains the Dream Theater sound and elements with a modern twist.  Creativity is to disappoint for long time fans but it can still be slightly enjoyable.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and enjoy the album... I guess.
0061777269|5.0|I've been looking into NDEs for a couple of years now, and I didn't realize that a book like this was available. I read Dr. Jeffrey Long's excellent book, but that seems more appropriate for the beginner. It feels more like a very good summary. (I also visit their website [...] frequently) The first part of this book seemed similar, but as I read on, I became excited! More aspects of the NDE experience and its possible explanations using scientific discoveries and conjectures are included. Also, refutations used by opponents of NDE theory, such as the most common one, that NDEs are caused by anoxia, are examined piece by piece. What happens in the brain when oxygen is unavailable is described in terms of the cell's metabolism. As the cell becomes depleted of oxygen, its integrity is lost. And yet consciousness continues, and it is clear and organized. Well, I'm still reading this book and am striving to install its excellent points in my brain so that I can address those folks who are sure there is no such thing!  For me, it's the most valid evidence of the existence of God and the afterlife that we have, so the more studying, the more research, the more explanations and theories that there are, the closer we come to getting our society back to a place where we realize that the material is not everything. I see atheism as a fad, and the sooner we move away from the excitement generated by people who were brought up going to church, but suddenly \\"realized\\" that there is \\"no proof\\" that there is a god and so they don't have to worry about all that stuff, the better.  Of course... we need, someone needs, to develop a way of worshiping our creator and guidance in following a spiritual path. People just laugh at the Bible, once they've tasted atheism!  So, Dr. Pim, here, God bless him, for this brilliant work, which I hope will be one of many along the path back to aligning ourselves with the Truth. It may actually be incomprehensible, but there are enough hints!!

B007AJFSJW|4.0|An excellent book, which questions many of the assertions that people have made about the world's current situation. The author explains the history of our economic thinking in a way which is easy to follow. The only question remains: why aren't more people listening to people who seem to have some idea about what needs to be done, instead of the doomsayers, who argue that we're in a hole and the only way out is to keep digging.
0142501123|5.0|My 2 year-old boys received this book as a gift from their Grandma.  I wanted to strangle her because it is the only book the boys would let us read for at least a month!  Every day, 4 or 5 times per day we had to read Room on the Broom.  The Witch isn't scary but, in fact, is quite nice.  It is a story of being helpful and kind to others.  Because of the great rhyming and cute pictures it is appropriate for children as young as 2 but the theme and silly nature of the book make it appropriate for older children as well.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I started reading the Fifty Shades of Grey series because I heard so much hype about it. The first book was good and so I continued the series. By the end of the second one, even the 'juicier' parts got repetitive. It just wasn't as fun to read about anymore. I wasn't even sure I wanted to read the third book, but was curious to see if the story would finally develop into something more. The third book was ok (again much repetition), but it's just convincing that the main character would change his personality so much just because of one person when he had been in therapy for years and his therapist didn't really get very far.<br /><br />Diana

0606259090|1.0|So, I've read bits, pieces and watched multiple reviews. And I'm flabbergasted that any woman would be so far removed from reality to think it was good idea to try BDSM out based on this flaming pile of horse shit. The REALITY of the situation is the average man practicing these acts is in a financial bracket of less than $6,000. a year. If you find one above that, then good for you. But it's guaranteed that you won't get exactly everything this character portrays in the book series. Furthermore, the acts described in this book that bear repetition lack creative luster. Might as well use summaries and just hash it out faster.<br /><br />In all, this series is a sham and shouldn't be paid much heed. If you want a real look at how things are done, check out the titles under Greenery Press.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|This amplifier definitely makes music louder and adds more bass (not that clear as I excepted thought). However, it also introduces terrible hiss even when there is no music source (and you can't get rid of it adjusting volume levels). I find it very distracting and returning the item.

0307592731|2.0|As a vehicle for pure entertainment, this book held my interest a good part of the time.  But as true memoir, I have difficulty believing this isn't another \\"no, really, I swear that's what happened!\\" kind of story, where Oprah will soon air a condemning reveal of all that was flourished or outright fictionalized in the telling.<br /><br />The story vacillates from the difficult to believe to the extremely repetitive, and sometimes manages to be both at once: how many times do we need to hear big, strong men tell her how heavy her pack is?  Or how pretty she is?  How many grueling, life-threatening walks need to be described before we know just how brave and crazy this was?  I found myself rolling my eyes on several occasions, and wanting to skim the details through many others.  I adored \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" and am a big fan of the \\"redemptive memoir\\" genre, but here I found myself liking and trusting the author's voice less and less as I read on.<br /><br />Finally, in my opinion, the last chapter is a total cop-out (spoiler alert - don't read further if you don't want to know how the book ends).  She touches the Bridge of the Gods, and next thing we know, all her intimacy issues have been resolved, and it's 9 years into a stable marriage to a wonderful, wonderful man, wonderful kids and a wonderful life.  The notion that punishing physical activity is the panacea for psychic suffering is absurd and possibly dangerous.  Such a journey can be a source of strength and esteem, but being alone in one's head while ripping one's feet to bloody shreds is not a reliable path to resolving childhood abandonment and mistrust of/intimacy issues with men.

B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I heard \\"Somebody that I Used to Know\\" on a Pandora.com mix that included Ari Hest, Joshua Radin, The Weepies and a few other upbeat singer-songwriter types, and the minute I heard the chorus, I was smitten.  I previewed \\"Making Mirrors,\\" and one by one, bought nearly every song until it just made more sense to go for the entire CD.  \\"In Your Light,\\" \\"Save Me,\\" \\"I Feel Better,\\" and \\"Easy Way Out\\" are some of the best tracks, but it's hard to pick favorites.  This is one of the best finds I've made this year.

0394818237|2.0|I'm not sure why I thought this was an updated version, but I was disappointed to find that this book is full of 1968 gender stereotypes.  All of the women are mommies and nurses, and nearly all of the other workers are men, save a few shopkeepers. It doesn't seem appropriate for my two young girls, but maybe it won't bother you if you have boys.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game. Very addictive. The only problem I have is matching the &quot;flower&quot; tiles. It's not very clear since they are not perfect matches.
B000C20VPA|4.0|Great movie based on how it was in Las Vegas during the 70's-80's', superb acting, excellent cast, but too long with too many boring parts. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone were excellent!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This band has hung around for 40 years, made some great albums in the early 1980's, continued from there with repetitive material but great concerts, and now suddenly they are better, massively better.  Not only does Clockwork Angels succinctly present a lifetime of life's lessons in precise lyrics, but these guys really really rock.  Rather than discuss each track, which are all incongruent with Top 40 tunes, I'll just say it's their most cohesive album ever.  No other band out today can but hide and listen in the force of this material.  The last track, Garden, is beyond thorough composition - it can only be compared to the great allegories of literature and classical music.  A few great rock bands have survived, but Rush is the only one I know that still thrives.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game wish I would have found it before now! even me little one likes to sit with me and watch me play.
B007Y2W44W|5.0|Album number seven from our good friends Nile and I was wondering how they could possible keep things fresh.<br />The album opens with \\"Enduring\\" and right off the bat I notice it sounds a LOT like Catacombs.<br />Very bright, very interesting riffs.<br />\\"Fiends\\" was released a while ago and really showcases what this album is like.<br />A ton of dynamics and variety.<br />\\"Degradation\\" mega speed and brutal complexity makes this one of my favorites. Insane leads.<br />\\"Wrath\\". This is NOT typical Nile. Sure it starts out with the cool Middle Eastern guitar but the main riff is total old school thrash/death.<br />Insanely brutal and catchy. Double kick at the end is unreal.<br />\\"Slaves\\"  YES, the brutal groan chant!!! Tribal devastation on disc. A lot like \\"Die Rache Krieg\\" from Catacombs but cooler.<br />\\"Sethu\\". An opening that is very speed metal in its approach. More amazing vocals.<br />\\"Natural\\" another blazer with some cool pinch harmonics.<br />\\"Ethno\\" another killer instrumental. Absolute shred fest and it's not even on electrics. Amazing work.<br />\\"Tribunal\\" mid paced and crunchy intro, picks up in the middle.<br />\\"Supreme\\" Chuggy and catchy. Prime Nile.<br />\\"Chaining\\" Moody and atmospheric. A slow, long cruncher of a song.<br />The two bonus tracks are instrumental versions of \\"Enduring\\" and \\"Degradation\\".<br />They're a nice addition but don't really add much to the album as a whole.<br /><br />To summarize...<br />Brilliant. Nile has recaptured that elusive magic from the debut with the brutal innovations of later releases.<br />An amazing combination of old and new.<br />The bright and varied riffs of Catacombs with the darkness of Shrines.<br />Brutal, varied drumming.<br />Interesting and unique vocals.<br />Guitars that shred as always.<br />Artwork from Seth Siro and it's beautiful and really sums up what Nile is all about.<br />Longtime fans should be happy and hopefully this album will bring in some new converts as well.<br />Highly recommended.ded.

B0028MBKVG|4.0|To be good at sports, you have to train and work hard. With this book, it seemed to be more of a way of life without always training. You can get drunk the night before or eat a cheeseburger and still go out there and perform well. Jenn and Billy, who are two characters in the second half of the book, really proved that point. The storytelling is great and the author only disappoints you in his failed attempts at running long distances. I enjoyed feeling like I was right there with the runners or on their many adventures. Not only that, but this is a non-fiction book, so the places really exist, the people are real, and the legend that these runners have is shown through this book (who they really are). Good read for the runner, couch potato, or non-fiction adventure reader!

B004EPZ070|5.0|I saw this film recently on a long haul flight.  I hadn't even heard of this film so it was more out of curiosity that I watched it.  I'm so glad I did. I loved this film.  It is not the straightforward boy meets girl, fall in love, have a hiccup, get together, the end - there is an affair involved. In real life I am disgusted by this sort of behaviour but the characters are played and developed so well that you really feel for the main characters. I even found myself rooting for Rachel in the end.  Because of this surprising feeling, I found myself thinking about the film long after I had watched it.<br /><br />One potential shortcoming of the film is Kate Hudson's character which is very one dimensional and unlikeable. I have since read the books 'something borrowed' by emily griffin and the sequel 'something blue'.  I think having read the latter, I understand more why Darcy's character was portrayed in such a one dimensional way in the film, so I'm prepared to overlook it. I guess it has to be this way (SPOILER!) otherwise the viewer wouldn't get behind Rachel and Dex.  The guy that plays Dex is incredible, he articulates emotion and feelings of angst so well and you get really involved in the story.<br /><br />I would urge anyone who enjoyed the film to read the books.  I actually enjoyed the 'something blue' book more than 'something borrowed' and I hope they get to make the film!

B004LWZW6U|3.0|The recent remake of [[ASIN:B002ZG98L4 Piranha]] was nearly pitch-perfect. Gleefully hapless characters (portrayed with excellent B-movie abandon by the likes of Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, and even Richard Dreyfus) trotted through the cliche-riddled story and provided both laughs and inventive, over-the-top gore. It wasn't out to win any awards, but what it WAS out to do -- amuse and disturb -- it did quite well. So, of course, they had to make a sequel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they neglected to include half of the original formula. Truly excessive T&A? Check. Obvious character archetypes doing/saying obvious things? Check. Humor, either hokey, offensive, or smart? Check. Scares and grind-em-up deaths?<br /><br />Not so much.<br /><br />The problem here lies right in the set-up: an unapologetically awful man (played by David Koechner) opens a water park (with an adults only section) and contrives to fill it for free from a nearby lake. Three guesses how that plays out.<br /><br />Yes. The piranhas infest the water park, and therein lies the problem. I don't know if you've ever been to a water park, but every one I've ever visited appeared to have been planned and designed by a blind man with permanent vertigo. This is usually in keeping with the looping, curving, twisting paths of the various water slides and lazy rivers, and it means it's not that hard to get turned around if the park is big. The point being: filming in one must be hell.<br /><br />There is never any real sense of place to the film, and the park is never given a wide enough shot to really show the scale of the disaster. At the same time, the very fact that people are inches away from simply hopping out of the water reduces both the scale, spectacle, and believability of any of the chaos. There's a ten or fifteen minute scene of people thrashing about in water that is two feet wide and three feet deep. Gone is even any attempt at terror or (failing that) anything close to the stomach-churning destruction found in the first film.<br /><br />The movie tries to make up for this in other ways. There are a couple of piranha attacks outside of the park, one of which is so over-the-top ludicrous that it is almost annoying. I won't give away any details, but I will say that it's one step away from characters shooting live piranhas out of shotguns like some kind of Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. But that's probably the point. While the first film was an aggressive and ham-fisted satire of Swarm Horror, this movie seeks only to be a cartoon of it. It's not really the same thing, and so this film -- if you'll pardon the pun -- very much lacks the bite that made the first one such a success.<br /><br />As a live action cartoon, though, it's not bad. David Hasselhoff does a great job of making fun of himself AND the film. (\\"Stupid ginger boy,\\" he complains when he hears the screams of a kid who's getting eaten. \\"Why did you get back in the water?\\") He's one of the better parts of the film, although he is also overused. Ving Rhames, Paul Scheer, and Christopher Lloyd, on the other hand, are woefully underused. They brighten up their brief blips in the film, but all of them feel like they were added to the script at the last minute. There are some puns and gags that work, and some that don't.<br /><br />It feels half done, is the point, and this is even evident in the run time. IMDB will tell you it's 83 minutes long, but that's counting the very slow credits crawl at the end. Perhaps knowing the deficit in their film, the makers put outtakes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel over half of these end credits. It's kind of like a nice, advanced special features addition, and I enjoyed it for what it was, but I also saw it for what it was meant to be: a quick, easy distraction from the fact that the film was more entertaining behind the scenes than in front of it.<br /><br />Fun for what it is, but not as fun as it wants to be or should live up to. You might enjoy yourselfif you have low expectations, or you might just have more fun watching Skinemax and putting some fish in a blender.if you have low expectations, or you might just have more fun watching Skinemax and putting some fish in a blender.

0062068423|2.0|My reaction to this book was simply MEH.  Perhaps because it was one of his first books but perhaps because I was too enamored with the GWDT series.  Whatever the case, I found Nesbo's descriptions dragged on forever.  Every new event was introduced by multiple pages setting the stage... and too often that set up had very little to do with what was to happen.  Because of this, I found myself lost in thought about who pissed me off that day, what I should wear to work tomorrow, or where I'd been to dinner last week, only to find myself not remembering a single thing I had spent the last 10 minutes reading.  Not what I consider a gripping page-turner.  And that's not to say they all should be but I think this may be a Nesbo one and done for me.  What upset me the most though is that the entire mystery ended up being explained in a confession letter.

Bunch of mumbo jumbo, fantasy crap mixed in with bunch of conspiracy.

A \\"Adonis-like\\" 27 year old billionaire who has his own jet, helicoptor, airplane, several Audis, housekeeper, butler...yadda yadda yadda.  And Ana....a 22 year old virgin who doesn't own a computer and has never had a boyfriend....yet she's gorgeous and all her male friends are in love with her (Jose, Paul, Elliott).<br /><br />What I'm wondering is....when does Christian have time to work?  I think maybe 3 times in the book she walks in and he's on a brief work-related phone call.  How does someone like him have time to stalk Ana, send countless emails, buy her expensive gifts, have sex multiple times a day, eat, sleep and run a billion-dollar corporation?  Seriously?<br /><br />Don't these people ever just lounge around the house in their sweatpants and watch tv like the rest of us ordinary folk?  Do they ever go to the grocery store or to McDonald's?

B005LAIHYU|3.0|I guess we owe Abraham Lincoln twin salvos of thanks, for ridding the nation of slavery... and for killing vampires. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER, I think, would've hugely benefited from a more tongue-in-cheek approach. I mean, there's already a built-in sense of the ridiculous just from the notion of our illustrious 16th President chopping down entire bevies of vampires with his trusty axe. But, for whatever reason, this film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's hit mash-up novel opts for a more somber presentation. Grahame-Smith himself wrote the screenplay so you can't even rant that this isn't the author's vision. This was one of the summer flicks I was looking forward to. Yikes.<br /><br />Honest Abe? No, not quite. There were dark secrets Abraham Lincoln firmly kept under his signature stove top hat. In this wild alternate biography, the narrative posits that not only was Abraham Lincoln the Great Emancipator, he also saved humanity from a relentless vampire incursion. To quote Lincoln's voiceover narration: \\"History prefers legends to men... However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth...\\" The film opens in Pigeon Creek, Indiana, in the year 1818, when Abraham was a young lad, as we learn the horrifying origins of his lifelong obsession with hunting and destroying vampires. From there the film skips ahead to Abe as a young man (now played by Benjamin Walker) as he miserably fails in his first stab at vampire slaying. Enter Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), enigmatic vampire expert who takes the inexperienced Abe under his wing and trains him in the art of tracking and snuffing out them malevolent creatures of the night. Cue the ridiculous(ly fun) training montage and the edge of Abe's favorite axe getting treated with silver, never mind that silver is notoriously the werewolf's bane, not the vampire's.<br /><br />Abe should've known better than to mix his politics with his vampire slaying. But fate has tapped Abe for bigger and better things. I know we stepped into the theater mostly to eyeball Abe taking out vampires, but, for the sake of some verisimilitude and as grounding support, I wish that the film had been more eloquent in depicting this most iconic of figures. I wish it had gone more into exhibiting Lincoln's statesmanship, that his orations were delivered with more conviction, that Benjamin Walker had fleshed out his role more convincingly and with more weight and charisma. The film pays lip service to the historical moments in Lincoln's life. Really, these moments only serve as framing points for the CG-heavy action sequences and to occasionally remind the audience that, hey, in case you forgot, this is the freakin' 16th President. Look, there's the Gettysburg address.<br /><br />I love, love, love those sequences in which Abe was dropping the mighty axe on the bloodsuckers. There is some amazing stunt work being done with the axe (lots of fancy axe twirling). The CG is very prominent, and I don't know that that horse stampede sequence is at all believable. Going in, I was keenly anticipating this film. The premise just made me happy. So I'm not sure what happened. Maybe Russian director Timur Bekmambetov is too mired in grand and heavy-handed mythology-building to make time and space for a wink of the eye, a nudge in the ribs. But this film could've done with a bright sense of fun. All that dramatic brooding eventually wears you down. Just as bad, the acting performances generally don't rise above the cripplingly solemn script, although I do think that Dominic Cooper turns in some pretty terrific scenes (I like his flashback story). There's also a reverse twist near the end which I didn't see coming, that I enjoyed.<br /><br />I do like the film's interpretation of the vampires. It's interesting that no vampire can kill another, that they vanish and then resurface in a terrifying blink. And with judicious dabs of sun balm, they even participate in theCivil War.<br /><br />Abe Lincoln as vampire slayer is just badasss. His action hero creds kept elevating as he relentlessly mowed down four score and seven (and more) of the undead. In fact, he comes off as so indomitable that, after a while, you stop treating him like a real character. You stop worrying about him. Ultimately, he's just one in a number of paper-thin characters inhabiting this movie. Benjamin Walker, unknown actor, has great physical presence but no gravitas. He fails to deliver on those emotional beats. He has zero chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays his love interest, Mary Todd. Walker doesn't really look like the Lincoln we're familiar with until around the third act. As revisionist histories go, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER falls victim to clunky storytelling and one-dimensional characterization but is buoyed by the well-executed action flourishes. There is a fun element of camp, yes, but an even stronger dose of cheekiness could've gone a long way. 3.5 out of 5 stars.Civil War.<br /><br />Abe Lincoln as vampire slayer is just badasss.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I just finished all three books in the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  It isn't great, but it wasn't terrible, either.  The sex scenes were a little much...as in, there were too many, and I got extremely irritated with all the sex scenes.  I mean...I knew the books contained several illicit scenes, but they were all similar.  And it was a little gross...\\"...and he spilled himself into me\\"  Seriously?<br />Ana was as annoying and boring as Bella Swan.  She did stupid stuff just to piss off Christian for no reason other than to provoke a fight and get a \\"spanking from his twitching palm\\".  If you liked Twilight (or read it out of curiosity) you'll probably enjoy this series.<br />I just felt it filled the void after reading the Hunger Games Series...but it wasn't something I'll be reading again.  Ever.

Apple goes over some of her well staked out territory of 'break-up' music but also adds in songs of a more grown-up longing and strength of purpose. She doesn't mince words as she sings, shouts and sometimes screams her soul into each song, without stooping to 'woe is me' melodrama. If you enjoy honest, mature explorations of emotion you will find a lot to love about this album.

B001IMFHTS|5.0|Prequel:<br />Please note that this review is the result of comparing the new Blu-ray set with the previous DVD set issued earlier. This review has therefore been completely re-written with that in mind and has replaced the earlier review which has now been deleted.<br />...................................<br />The new review:<br /><br />Abbado has recorded this set of symphonies several times and this is his last set recorded in 2000-2001. It represents a considerable modification of his previous interpretations and this series reflects his thinking in the light of recent research into period performing practice. The set of performances is centred around the Del Mar edition which is the latest thinking on the subject and is based on Beethoven's final markings. It is generally thought to be Abbado's finest whole set.<br /><br />As mentioned in the introductory paragraph above, Abbado uses the new score prepared by Jonathan Del Mar which incorporates `the very latest Beethoven research and represents a valuable supplement to the experience gained by Abbado over many years' (booklet quote). Although Abbado does not go as far as using authentic period styled instruments, he nevertheless often uses much reduced orchestral sizes, even in the Eroica, and avoids part doubling in the wind.<br /><br />The speeds are generally fleeter without losing necessary gravitas in the slow movements. Speeds are kept constant and avoid the Romantic period type of fluctuations to be found in the recent set of Thielemann performances for example. The same can be said of phrasing. Textures are leaner but not acerbic as in some early examples of early instrument performance. Timpani are usually struck with semi-hard sticks which could be said to be a fair compromise. This set will not offend traditionalists or disappoint period practice enthusiasts. It could be the best of compromises therefore.<br /><br />The Blu-ray issue follows exactly the same disc layout as those in the individual DVD issues. The bonus feature of conductor angle in four of the symphonies is the same as before as is the bonus interview with Abbado, recorded in 2002, in which he puts forward his current views on Beethoven performing practice. The imaging has been sharpened up and gives enhanced skin tone and instrumental detail in all but the furthest shots, which are rare. Even those have been tightened up to a significant degree beyond normal eyesight capability at the range of the camera.<br /><br />The image does not withstand close viewing in the way that the latest issues can - but that would not seem to be a good way to view the discs anyway and is fine at reasonable viewing distances. Camera work is sympathetic and typical of the fine work of producer Paul Smaczny. It gives close detail or not as seems appropriate and is not oppressive in its closeness. Nor does it suffer from hyper-activity. The sound is presented in excellent DTS and stereo, both of which are well balanced and of good dynamic range.<br /><br />A striking feature of the grouping of the symphonies in this set is that it becomes very apparent that these performances can be grouped as distinct character groups. The first disc brings together three symphonies that share a genial mood. The next disc has a dramatically incisive coupling. The third disc pairs two symphonies sharing a sense of the epic and the final disc couples two symphonies through a strong sense of dance. Obviously these are broad generalisations and all of Beethoven's symphonies also have elements of all these characteristics. Nevertheless the groupings here do actually make sense in the context of these performances.<br /><br />...........................................<br /><br />Symphonies 6, 1 and 8 making a genial set as performed here.<br />This is the first disc and presented in this order. Speeds are quite brisk but not excessive in the sixth. The first movement is the steadiest and the storm is unusually exciting. The concluding movement and the second movement have an easy lilt to them which bring about a clear sense of joy. The first symphony has more reduced forces but the speeds are very close to traditional and therefore pretty steady. The mood is genial but kept alive by being sharply articulated. The last movement builds to an exciting conclusion largely as a result of excitingly precise articulation by the strings and woodwind especially. One interesting point to note is that Abbado goes from movement to movement without a pause. This gives an enhanced sense of continuity of thought. Symphony 8 follows traditional lines as regards general tempi and phrasing. The tempi fall firmly within the traditional range but towards the top and the phrasing is also traditional. The joy of the performance lies in the precision of the execution and ,as throughout the set, the quality of the string and woodwind work is especially notable. This is a sunny performance generally with drama mainly built into the accenting from within rather than imposed by interpretation additions from without. This is also conveyed by the smiles to be seen flitting among the players.<br /><br />Symphonies 2 and 5 making a dramatically incisive pairing as performed here.<br />Both of these symphonies are played for maximum drama. The tempi are within traditional speeds but accenting and phrasing is pushed home incisively. For the first time the brass have edge, especially the horns. The orchestra is a little larger in number 2 but the scale of their playing is much larger in concept. This is Beethoven with attitude and far removed from number 1. The fifth symphony likewise is played for maximum drama but within normal traditional parameters of tempi although the final two movements are at normal top speeds. To achieve this extra power Abbado fields a full-sized orchestra without doubling in the winds but otherwise with no further restraints. Once more the effect is mainly in the impact of the playing which takes no prisoners so to speak but this time amplified by the scale of the orchestra and modern instruments. The dynamic scale is considerably greater in the playing in these two symphonies than in the three on the first disc. The playing is more markedly dramatic in both symphonies rather than exciting in apparent intention. This is conveyed by the clearly determined concentration to be found on the players' faces.<br /><br />Symphonies 9 and 3 in fleet performances that still have a sense of the epic<br />The ninth symphony opens this disc and is the one symphony not recorded as part of the Rome sequence. It was recorded nine months earlier in Berlin with a full orchestra and a stellar set of four soloists. This particular performance is notably a speedy event at 1 minute 51 seconds faster than Ozawa's fleet 'live' Japanese performance of the first movement, 52 seconds faster in the second movement and 64 seconds faster in the third movement. The final movement is about the same overall duration but with greater contrasts of tempi with the faster sections being very fast. He is also faster than Immerseel's 'live' 'period' performance. The first movement has great clarity and rises to particularly powerful climaxes. The second movement has a strong sense of the 'dance' about it rather in the manner of the seventh symphony. The trio section of the movement is noticeably faster than the outer sections which makes it very fast. The slow third movement keeps a strong forward pace at a slow one in a bar instead of 3 in a bar pacing with the emphasis being on on flowing lyricism. The final movement is one of tempi extremes with the faster sections being fast and exciting and the slower sections being periods of contrasting calm. Throughout the performance the drama is emphasised with the timpani using much harder sticks than in any of the other symphonies as per period considerations.<br />Symphony 3 follows the same pattern as with the rest of the Rome performances with fleet and incisive playing, accenting and phrasing. The scale of this is larger than the first symphony with a substantial orchestra. However the effect is not so dramatically powerful as the second and fifth pairing but is focussed on scale of concept instead. This comes over as more of an epic symphony rather than as a dramatic symphony. This is a subtle but important differentiation.<br /><br />Symphonies 4 and 7 making a pairing linked together by a strong sense of the dance<br />Both of these symphonies share strong dancing rhythms brought out clearly in these performances. There is a sense of joy too, but this joy is no laughing matter as it is underpinned by a clear dramatic drive. This dramatic drive reaches its climax in the finale to the seventh symphony with tightly controlled rhythm delivered at a pace that requires utmost concentration from the orchestral members. This is a virtuoso performance and gets the most enthusiastic standing ovation of the whole series from the audience. It is richly deserved. The orchestra is reduced quite a bit in the fourth symphony but is almost up to full strength in the context of this series for the seventh. The timpani make more use of hard sticks in these symphonies to keep a tight hold on the developing drama. In the seventh symphony the hard pressed horns do well at the end of the first movement supported by bright trumpets but at the end of the last movement the roles are reversed with the horns gamely supporting the more dominant trumpets. Tempi in both symphonies are within traditional boundaries. By that I am aware that such speeds were achieved by Erich Klieber/VPO, Beecham/RPO and Monteux/LSO at the transition between the mono and stereo eras and were every bit as exciting then, although maybe not as well executed as the BPO on this disc.<br /><br />...................................<br /><br />This is a major investment and the presentation on Blu-ray makes the most of what were good DVD discs. Imaging is of good quality, if not the equal of the very latest HD technology. The sound is very good indeed. This set is firmly placed within the Classical Period with few, if any, modifications of tempi and phrasing more suitable for the late Romantic Period.<br /><br />As such the performances can be described as 'period aware' without actually being period performances. This is likely to please both traditionalists as well as period enthusiasts. More importantly, the set seems to be completely true to the spirit of Beethoven and as such deserves to be seriously considered as an important artistic statement and therefore also a very tempting potential purchase.<br /><br />...........................................<br /><br />A note to the anonymous negative voter:<br /><br />The voting system is specifically only about reviews being 'helpful' or 'unhelpful'<br />Goodness only knows what you find to be `unhelpful' about this review.<br /><br />A negative vote without reason is not helpful to anyone.

This dramatic drive reaches its climax in the finale to the seventh symphony with tightly controlled rhythm delivered at a pace that requires utmost concentration from the orchestral members. This is a virtuoso performance and gets the most enthusiastic standing ovation of the whole series from the audience. It is richly deserved. The orchestra is reduced quite a bit in the fourth symphony but is almost up to full strength in the context of this series for the seventh. The timpani make more use of hard sticks in these symphonies to keep a tight hold on the developing drama. In the seventh symphony the hard pressed horns do well at the end of the first movement supported by bright trumpets but at the end of the last movement the roles are reversed with the horns gamely supporting the more dominant trumpets. Tempi in both symphonies are within traditional boundaries. By that I am aware that such speeds were achieved by Erich Klieber/VPO, Beecham/RPO and Monteux/LSO at the transition between the mono and stereo eras and were every bit as exciting then, although maybe not as well executed as the BPO on this disc.  ...................................  This is a major investment and the presentation on Blu-ray makes the most of what were good DVD discs. Imaging is of good quality, if not the equal of the very latest HD technology. The sound is very good indeed. This set is firmly placed within the Classical Period with few, if any, modifications of tempi and phrasing more suitable for the late Romantic Period.  As such the performances can be described as 'period aware' without actually being period performances. This is likely to please both traditionalists as well as period enthusiasts. More importantly, the set seems to be completely true to the spirit of Beethoven and as such deserves to be seriously considered as an important artistic statement and therefore also a very tempting potential purchase.  ...........................................

0451457994|5.0|\\"He had travelled these millions of miles in search of mystery; and now, it seemed, the mystery was coming to him.\\"<br /><br />A Space Odyssey is a glimpse into Clarke's vision of space exploration, as we travel through the strange and unfamiliar; it is every bit equal to Kubrick's film version in its depth and intellect.  Clearly Clarke (who worked also on the film) wanted to make this book parallel the film, yet the book fills in some of the film's intentional vagueness. What is extraordinary about 2001 is how it projects the infiniteness and awe-wondering aspects of space, questioning the possibilities of technology and other-world intelligences. Simply put, it is a book that makes one think.<br /><br />2001 has enough introspect into the beyond to satisfy the sci-fi fan , yet it is also quite an assessable book for non-sci-fi fans. Although profound and deep in themes, Clarke writes with a smooth, direct narrative that takes us from the ages of the ape men to the present day and future. While Clarke reveals hints about potential threats to the crew's mission, he also uses ambiguity as to who or what is causing this. A mysterious monolith appears in each of the stages of time that could be the clue to other intelligent life forms. The odyssey takes us on board the Discovery with Poole and Bowman and HAL, with Bowman travelling past Jupiter, Saturn and the vastness of space.  While the astronauts are on their expedition, something seriously malfunctions with HAL. Those who might expect a highly, technical, verbose science fiction might be surprised how smooth and clear the writing is. The prose is amazingly vivid and imaginative. The eeriness of space during Bowman's journey is perfectly depicted, and the book's final moments, in particular the Stargate sequence, are as amazing and visual as the film.<br /><br />Although this novel won't appeal to some, for my money 2001 is quite a ride, one that really blows your mind.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome! It's also very addicting. You try to run away from some ape-like creatures while avoiding obstacles.

B0081L37Z0|4.0|21 Jump Street is a funny, entertaining film.  The two main characters, played well by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, are two inept police officers who are sent undercover back to high school (much the basic premise of the original television show).<br /><br />The pair has difficulty fitting back in, but through comedic adventures and high-octane action, they uncover the drug ring and ultimately have success.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|So after a brief hiatus of reading fantasy I decided to fire up the Kindle last night and went onto the Amazon Store Recommendations. Buried around page 4 I saw Blood Song with a 5 star average, over 100 reviews, and with a bargain basement price. I thought to myself, \\"No way, there has to be some astroturfing going on here.\\"<br /><br />Well, I ended up staying awake for 15+ hours and having a terrible day at work but I literally could not put the Kindle down.<br /><br />To those who aren't sure about this, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!?<br /><br />It reads like a combination of Rothfuss' Name of the Wind and Sanderson's Way of Kings. Absolutely gripping stuff.<br /><br />Can not wait for the 2nd one to come out. PLEASE raise the price though, Anthony Ryan deserves much more than the $3 he's pulling now.

0070511136|4.0|It's been more than 25 years since Rackham introduced the concepts of SPIN Selling, so you might think this book is outdated.  It's not.  The key concept of selling through questions is as valid as ever.  This book is practical and entertaining.  A great resource for any salesperson.

B000JQ4TJ8|4.0|I got this book for my 7 year old to read at bedtime and it was a good book with lots of good illustrations for his imangination. He was able to read it easily and he liked it a lot and so did I. It has become one of his favorite good night books to read at bedtime.

B0063IH60K|5.0|A lot of fun to play.  Watch out though; this game is hard to put down.  That one game always turns into ten!
B008CLI4N4|1.0|A 10 episode season spread out over 5 discs, really?!?  The extras being no more substantive than the old promo adverts that ran on HBO, this seems no more than a pretty transparent tactic for inflating the price point.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Let me just say that I could not put the book down and as soon after I finished reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I read Fifty Shades Darker and then Fifty Shades Freed.  I don't think I could find another erotic book like it.  It has opened my mind to exploring some new things sexual.
0345803485|5.0|The characters come alive in this lovely, fast, and easy read.<br /><br />One should not be too frightened by the dark, dirty sex that appears in the book (there are only about 3 hardcore scenes of dom/sub life).<br /><br />This book is hot, daunting, and mysterious making you craving for more.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My favorite Disney movie since I was little on DVD. Looks great with the remastered colors. Totally worth the money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is fun and easy to play. Its relaxing to play when trying to rest. There should be more games like this to play from the web that is the relaxing.

B004P8JPS6|3.0|I've now read all of the Reacher novels beginning with Killing Floor and finishing up with The Affair.  This one was an enjoyable read if you like the premise that Jack Reacher is a nearly indestructable fighting and killing machine with flashes of insight that no one else can see even if they trip over them.  Lee Child doesn't let facts or reason interfere with plot and action and as long as you realize that and accept it, the books (including this one) are entertaining.<br /><br />This installment of the Reacher story is (as others have mentioned) a sort of prequel to Killing Floor (giving the background of why Reacher ultimately leaves the army).  It's set in a fictional town in Northeast Mississippi, which is where I live now (having grown up as an Air Force brat on bases around the world - which was a far cry from the fictional experience of Reacher growing up on Marine bases around the world).  It was kind of funny to read about the one midnight train coming through the town each day (there are so many trains coming through Tupelo, where I live, that most people plan their routes so as to avoid the tracks if at all possible), and that that Corinth, Mississippi has one movie theater and Tupelo used to have a vaudeville theater that was now closed (like most cities in this country, there are malls and cinamaplexes with multiple screens in both Corinth and Tupelo).<br /><br />So the story is set in 1997, but Child is really trying to evoke a Mississippi that might have existed in the 1930's in order to fit in to his plot.  The problem is that he still gets it wrong in several ways, but despite living here and knowing better, it didn't get in the way of the story for me.<br /><br />Child doesn't make it clear where Reacher is stationed in this novel, but based on the others in the series it would likely have been in Virginia or North Carolina - neither of which are within a six hour bus ride from Memphis, Tennessee.  But that's what you have to set aside when you read Lee Child - facts and logic.  Not all of this is Child's complete fault - I really have to blame his editors.  For instance, in Gone Tomorow Childs clearly doesn't understand the term \\"lame duck\\" when talking about political races and a good editor could have helped out by suggesting another term (this is early in the book when candidates trailing in the polls are referred to as lame ducks - not the meaning at all).  Worse is the reference in Killing Floor to \\"soft-nose twenty-two gauge shells\\" when it clearly should be \\"caliber\\" not \\"gauge\\".  There are jarring goofs like that in most of the books, but I still read them all and enjoyed them all.  It's light reading, fun and predictable in the sense that you know the good guy will win and the bad guys (and gals) will lose.<br /><br />If you're looking for thrillers like Michael Connelly puts together, or police procedurals like those from John Sandford, or cerebral mysteries like those written by P D James - then don't read Reacher stories.  If you're hung up on every detail being technically correct, then this series will drive you nuts.  But if you just want a book to kick back and read knowing that Reacher will get the bad guys and put them down - have at it.  This installment was a little slower than some of the others, but not that much and I enjoyed it and will certainly read more Reacher when published.<br /><br />I thought about giving the book two stars, but the way I rate books is by comparing them to similar books in a particular genre.  As far as action/thrillers go, this particular Reacher book plods a little more than Killing Floor (five stars) and isn't quite as good as some of the other books in the series, but it's still worth reading and so I give it three stars.read Lee Child - facts and logic.

B005FPT51K|5.0|The iBaby has been great for me. It was very easy to install and has worked pretty well (see sound problem in next sentence) since I hooked it up. My only initial complaint with the monitor was the poor sound quality; however in the latest update of the iBaby app they changed the way in which sound was transmitted and it has fixed any sound problem I used to have.... It works great around the house or states away. My child's grandparents live states away from me and they can view the monitor on their Iphones perfectly.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I love this game it is awesome although at times it gets on my nerves. I think it's easy kind've but not aswell.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|For you regards who don't know how to write learn how too.  Burt overall good and fun game. The cost is a little high but I say its worth $7
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book for my son as a Father's Day gift from me to him. He loved it and I do too. Lots of inside jokes for Star Wars fans, obviously... but I doubt you'd be looking at this if you aren't one already.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Beautiful album. Living in the presence of the Lord is a beautiful song. Thank you.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|The show is likely to be the most under appreciated shows ever.  It's sad because it's one of my all time favorite.<br />The acting is superb. The production value is phenomenal.  And the story lines are amazing.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|so much fun. I cant stop playing this game. wish there were more like it. it easy to navigate and I love the minigames in it.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|OK, I downloaded the free version of this a couple of months ago and it was ok if you want to see strange places, but that got boring real quick. As I was getting ready to completely remove it from my fire I decided to check it out one more time. When I did I decided to check out the upgrade and read up on what this was capable of, and I gambled the $3.49 and purchased it... I AM BLOWN AWAY! I can actually see my home on my fire from anywhere. I downloaded webcamXP 5 to my laptop(free) and I can see what my laptop's camera is seeing anytime from anywhere I can get online. I got an inhome security system for less than 4 bucks! (I watched my dog meander through the house, always wondered what he did all day, lol). The webcamXP 5 program can actually be scheduled to turn on the camera whenever you want it. I LOVE this tinyCam Monitor PRO and I highly reccommend it. It works perfectly with my Kindle fire.

0091947561|1.0|I had high hopes. This book contains about 6 pages of retreaded encouragement that would make a Nike sneaker blush.<br />That leaves 242 pages for the two authors to quote all the athletes that have been quoted in other self-help books and pat each other on the back time after time. It gets boring after a bit.  Don't think that your garage based idea is going to get a start from anything in this book, because they are only talking about mega organisations that they have been affiliated with and sadly there is no room for your ego with theirs in the room.<br /><br />Just because you have made it does not mean that you can write a book that others should read.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|What sets Rush apart from all the other aging rock bands is they write songs/lyrics that people of all ages can relate to because they challenge you think, they are mature but youthful.  These three guys (actually Peart writes all the lyrics) are not just writing songs about the usual fair that we find in rock lyrics, i.e., sex, partying, silly anthems, not that there is anything wrong with that, but let's all admit that it gets a little nauseating when a band is in their fifties or sixties and they are still trying to act like they are fifteen.  It's actually kind of sad isn't it?<br />Yet, Rush has also made the choice not to spend all of their time in ballad land like many older rockers tend to do.  Randy Newman once referred to many older artists reverting to ballad land when they are trying to appeal to a grown-up audience or maybe they just ran out of good ideas.  Instead, like Robert Plant, U2 and Peter Gabriel, Rush is aging rather gracefully while still maintaining an edge and they prove this on Clockwork Angels.<br />  The songs on Clockwork Angels are ingenuous and full of positive energy.  From start to finish this is a timeless album by Rush. Each song carries its own weight and adds color to the story being told.  There are even a few radio friendly songs in the mix, The Wreckers, Wish Them Well and Headlong Flight. Wish Them Well is almost danceable and the melody just won't stop.  There is a lot of variety on this record so you can play it extensively without getting tired of it.  Get It!

B00005T7I1|4.0|This is still one of my favorite movies ever. Super cheesy, and very 90s, but tons of fun. All the comic book movies we see now are comic books translated into films, but this was essentially a live action comic book. Great make-up effects, fun set designs, and awesome costumes. And Madonna isn't terribly annoying, which is a nice surprise.
B007A2O3FO|2.0|This could have been a great little film- great cast, good story, etc. But the timing was really off, and some of the acting was phony. Some of the move came across as silly. I love Julian Fellowes- not his best work. Too bad.

B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I own all Offspring albums, and love them all.  But all albums back to and including Conspiracy of One have been a little more hit or miss.  The latest, \\"Days Go By\\" is no different.  But for me, the highs are higher and more plentiful than every other post \\"classic era\\" album.<br /><br />1.  The Future Is Now:  It bothers me a little how similar this sounds to Rise Against - Savior.  But I enjoy it more than that song, and it is a solid, high-powered opener for the album.  (8.5/10)<br />2.  Secrets From the Underground:  Nothing spectacular, but good lyrics, and another solid effort.  (8.5/10)<br />3.  Days Go By:  Mid-tempo rock song that can sound a little generic at times (much like Can't Repeat from their greatest hits album).  Okay choice as a first single, but not as good as Hammerhead or You're Gonna Go Far, Kid from Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace. (7.5/10)<br />4.  Turning Into You:  We finally get something a little closer to the classic punk sound, complete with the double-time drum beat.  Reminds me of Conspiracy of One album sound. (9/10)<br />5.  Hurting As One:  Now we're talking.  As others have said this could've been on Smash/Ixnay/Americana and not sounded out of place at all.  Classic driving punk. (10/10)<br />6.  Cruisin' California:  As has been noted in other review, this is a very divisive song.  The first time I heard it, I was thinking \\"WTF is this ****?  This isn't an Offspring song!\\"  But understand that this is a joke song, and in my opinion it actually manages to be more fun and upbeat than the songs it is mocking.  Not my favorite here, but a catchy tune.  That said, it probably shouldn't be a single.  (7.5/10)<br />7.  All I Have Left Is You:  Power ballads are not The Offspring's strong suit.  Only two \\"slower\\" or \\"ballad-y\\" songs by them have reached greatness:  Gone Away (Ixnay) and A Lot Like Me (RaF,RaG).  This one doesn't do it for me, and won't for you either unless you liked Fix You off of RaF,RaG. (5/10)<br />8.  O.C. Guns:This song is ridiculous.  Just absurd.  I laugh every time it comes on.  Very far off the beaten path, but a fun song that gets stuck in my head. (7/10)<br />9.  Dirty Magic:  I may SLIGHTLY prefer the original mix, which had a dirtier (see what I did there?) sound and a faster tempo.  But this re-recording is very good as well, and the modern production values do well for adding \\"meat\\" to the chorus. (8/10)<br />10.  I Wanna Secret Family (With You):  I want to like this song, but the title sounds stupid, and the content is meh as well.  A little too poppy for my liking, but not awful, and not one I'd skip over.  I will say it has grown on me with repeated listens.  (6/10)<br />11.  Dividing By Zero:  Badass.  This song could easily be at home on Ignition, if the production values were slightly downgraded.  This song above all others on the album feature the band going back to their roots. (10/10)<br />12.  Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides The Bomb To Hell:  Awesome song to finish the album.  Right up there with my favorite overall Offspring songs (at least for now... we'll see if that remains the case once the newness wears off).  Catchy punk rock that nobody does better than The Offspring.<br /><br />Overall:  This is definitely their best work since Americana.  Smash/Ixnay/Americana are my three favorite Offspring albums (in no particular order; I can never decide; I go back and forth).  But this one as of right now slides in at a clear #4 on my list.  Do I think this is a new \\"glory era\\" for Offspring starting with this record?  No, but it's definitely the high point of their \\"past their prime\\" years without a doubt.  This record proved that they can still get it done.<br /><br />The album seems to be getting bashed by \\"professional\\" reviewers, and I haven't agreed with much of the reasoning in most of those reviews.<br /><br />For the \\"old school\\" Offspring purists, who hate everything post-Americana (and may even somewhat hate Americana), this won't change your mind most likely.<br /><br />But anyone who even remotely enjoyed Conspiracy, Splinter, and RaF,RaG should love this one, because it contains bits and pieces of the sound that defined the band at ALL points of their career.<br /><br />Starts strong and finishes in epic fashion, with a bit of a mixed bag in between.  Very solid Offspring album.  They've still got it.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Like I said I'm not much of a reader to be honest just because I usually have trouble finding a book that keeps my interest and I end up sitting it down and forgetting about it. I really only got this book because I like the TV series so much and I have had a Kindle for six months and didn't have any books on it. I thought the book was great, read it in a couple nights. The writing style takes a little getting used to but once you do it flows great. Already got the second in the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Seriously? I couldn't wait to purchase book TWO. What?! I hate reading! But I just can't stop! This has been a great series so far. I don't want it to end.

They have been great.<br /><br />Some of the Positives of the shoe are the snug fit, good arch, durability, breathability, etc. I have been through wet, snowy, and icy conditions and these have been my best all around shoe yet. Recently I did an ultramarathon on pavement and had no problem with the shoe.<br /><br />You will like this if you are looking for a solid training shoe which will last.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great trilogy. Nice ending. I loved it and I still can't believe I read all three books in less than five days. My kindle has become my best friend again. Thank you E L James
B000JMKTLO|3.0|It's a page-turner, to be sure, but personally, if a book/movie/artwork is going to be disturbing, I want the story to be so good as to merit the ick. Overall I didn't think the story was strong enough or believable enough to carry the upsetting components.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I jumped on the bandwagon. I'm not much of a book reader but because of all the buzz, I decided to dive in. This book got me stuck to my kindle for the last 5 days. Even my husband couldnt figure out why I was always buried in it. I NEVER read. The story sucked me in and I really enjoyed it. I'm sure my husband is happy too. *wink wink*

B000001FTJ|4.0|I heard this in a dorm in 1992 and after watching the movie \\"Robots\\"<br />decided to splurge on this CD. Hard to explain why I like it, it is unique<br />among the music I know, so strange and rugged and very strange to me;<br />I can only think of Kate Bush as being as strange.<br /><br />Good songs are 1, 2, 7, 10, 13 (yes, I did select for my lossless<br />digital collection only a part of a concept album).
1612130283|5.0|Wow. What can I say other than I loved this book. It had me hooked and completely drawn into it from the first page. I do not know what all the controversy was about. It is just an alternative lifestyle practiced by consenting adults. Nothing over the top as far as I am concerned. If you are not open minded this is not the book for you. If you can let go of your inhibitions you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000001ZS3|4.0|A rather short CD from a pioneer of electronic music at his best.<br />I still prefer Vangelis but this is good for variation!
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is a game that requires thinking skills and will help to keep your mind sharp in a world today where our brains are turning to mush.  A good thinking/puzzle game is good for all of us now & then.  This game provides challenge, and problem solving to the otherwise boring & brainless gaming world!  BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!
030758836X|5.0|I did, and I don't regret it.  Seemed to start out as chick lit, and took a crazy offbeat turn, this book was engrossing, and I couldn't put it down.  Impressive the way the author manipulates your feelings for the characters, a great summer read.
B003BD236C|2.0|I was required to watch the movie... It was interesting at first, but not interesting enough to keep me awake during the second half.

B0086700CM|2.0|it is fun but it sucks.I jumped and landed in the water by it self.Don't get the game I'm warning also gets a virous sometimes.
B0086700CM|2.0|I don't think you should get this game because it freezes a lot and it is very slow if it isn't frozen. I am very disappointed with this app. If they want to have a good app the should fix the freezing and the running slow stuff. It is a lot better on the iphone, ipod, and ipad. Again I am very dissapointed with this app on the kindle fire.
B00782O7IY|1.0|The first point I would like to make is that I have no objections to this film.  My only beef is with its soundtrack.  Do I mind the black and white?  No I don't.  Do I mind the 4x3 screen?  No I don't.  Do I mind that it's a silent?  No I don't.  These things are inconsequential to me.  I am quite used to all three, having grown up on a fare of old time Hollywood films.  Is this a great film?  No, I don't think it's a great film, but it's certainly a good film, and it's a cute film.  Manipulative?  Yes, but then aren't all films manipulative?  As far as a history lesson, there is nothing new to learn here.  Anyone familiar with the chaos that ensued when silents began to talk already knows what happened.  There are no revelations here.  This story might be revelatory to today's audiences, who are not familiar with the silent era, but it isn't to any real movie fan.  So yes, I liked the film.  And I loved Dujardin.  His amalgam of Chaplin and Fairbanks is wonderful to see.  And the bastard is damn sexy!  I haven't been so turned on by an actor in years.  Even if he is overweight.  It's a great performance.  His smile alone is worth the price of admission.  But I began to have a problem with the music early on when what appears to be a love theme in the film sounded to me very much like a variation of Kurt Weill's, Speak Low, from One Touch of Venus.  And then when it came to the sequence where the music from Vertigo is used, the film ceased to matter to me, and I just couldn't concentrate on anything but Bernard Herrmann's wonderful score.  Who is the idiot who decided to use such a well known piece of music as \\"soundtrack underscoring\\"?  I have no objection to any piece of music being included in a film, as long as it is done properly.  Look at what Unchained Melody did for Ghost!  In The Artist we get a fabulous version of Pennies From Heaven which is delightful, and it actually adds to the film and works for the film.  But to use Herrmann's music as it is used here?  As if it were an original composition?  No can do.  I am afraid Kim Novak was right.  It is rape!  I understand it's legal rape, and by the credits I can see that the Vertigo soundtrack was properly licensed.  But it's rape nevertheless.  I hope this doesn't set a trend, because I'd hate to see the same thing happen to Steiner, Korngold, Raksin, Waxman, and all the other great composers from the golden age of film.  And please spare me any indignation about my use of the word rape.  It's a word like any other.  Get used to it!  It can depict a heinous act, or it can be used metaphorically.  Kim and I have used it metaphorically.  We don't need any feedback.  Free country.  And BRAVA! to Kim for her fabulous cojones.  Well done, Miss Novak!<br /><br />++++After I wrote this review I did a little research on the lady who sings Pennies from Heaven.  I loved her version so much, that when I first watched the film, I actually stopped the DVD and went back to hear it a second time.  Her name was Rose Murphy, she was black, played the piano, and sang.  She was known as the Chi-Chi girl.  She recorded for RCA and Verve.  I had never heard of her, but I plan to get my hands on her recordings.  The woman was absolutely FABULOUS!  If anyone has pertinent information on her, please share it!++++re?

1401300529|2.0|I have a bad or good habit, judge as you will, of pretty much always finishing a book once I've started it.  This was tested sorely to the limits with David Halberstams \\"The Coldest Winter\\" which I had borrowed from my local Library in the hope of filling in the ample gaps in my knowledge of the Korean War.  Instead, within a few score pages, it became apparent that the book had immense and ultimately fatal problems.  The fact that there are 650+ pages meant that my reading endurance was tested to its limits.<br /><br />The amount of clichés is simply astounding as well as a blizzard of trite sound bites, sentimentalism and more than a few dubious judgements.  Sentences such as \\"he passed all kinds of secret tests, and he [Kim Il Sung] was a true believer\\" appear continuously in the text: the stuff of caricature and they occur with regard to everyone who makes an appearance, from the lowliest soldier to such historical figures as General MacArthur, Harry Truman, Mao and General Ridgeway.<br /><br />The book is subtitled \\"America and the Korean War\\" and I expected that the American contribution to the Korean War would have primacy.  What I cannot accept is the utterly miserable amount of space that is given to the Koreans.  With the exception of the two leading figures of North and South there is only the odd sentence or paragraph on the Korean people themselves.  The reader is left, beyond a few shallow generalities, with little idea of what their experience of the War was.  There is not even much in the way of detail regarding how partition happened, or the status of the two Koreas in the period between the end of WW2 and the beginning of the Korean War.  The War itself is sometimes glossed over and at other times actions are given in excessive detail, every other soldier seems to get his fifteen cliché ridden sentences of fame.<br /><br />The analysis at times is a little dubious, for example Truman is quoted as saying \\"If we stand up to them like we did in Greece three years ago, they won't take any next steps.  But if just stand by, they'll move into Iran and they'll take over the whole Middle East.\\"  Truman is speaking about what the Soviets will do if he doesn't intervene in Korea, but Halberstam does not think to add that the Soviets never supported the Greek communists and had left Iran four or so years before under a minimal amount of external diplomatic pressure.<br /><br />The book does have a few saving graces but could have been cut in half, or even more, and been a fairly reasonable account of the Korean War.  The lunacy of General MacArthur: his extreme right wing views and the personality cult that surrounded him are clearly stated, as are the tensions in Washington between the Democrat adminstration and a right wing Republican opposition in the post Chinese Revolution era (with its endless debates about who lost China) and their McCarthyism in full flow.  The abrasive relationship between General MacArthur and the Democrats in Government is made reasonably clear and even at times interesting.  The role that the pervasive American racism regarding Asians played in underestimating first the North Korean forces and then the Chinese is a persistant theme, though it is merely explicated as being of \\"that time\\".<br /><br />In brief, I think that this is a book with more than a few interesting points to make but they are few and far between and any reader who undertakes the journey will have to wade through an unbelievable amount of trite quotes and clichés.  There must surely be a better general history of the Korean War than this book?

1451648537|5.0|I found this book to be a riveting look at Steve Jobs.  Walter Isaacson does a great job of research and interviewing.  I thought it painted a great picture of not only how Apple got to where it is today, but also Jobs as a person.  I am 27 years old so I was not of an age to truly understand how good or bad Apple products were when Apple was in it's infant to adolesecent years.  As I write this review from my iPad I do know how good of a company it has become though.  Reading this book brought a new light to me on who Jobs was a person, and I have to say it was a disappointment.  He was a marketing genius but a poor human being in many ways, in my opinion.  I have always heard he was a bit prickely but this book depicted him as a very bad man at many times in his life.  If you are a fan of Apple products and stories of success this would be a great read.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I don't really like this sharpener that much. I think its main positive is that it is small and can be carried just about anywhere. I have had so so results getting a good edge on different knives with this device.  In my opinion, the AccuSharp tool is far superior for putting a good edge on a knife in a short amount of time and is comparably priced.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|First off I just want to say WOW what an amazing book by Rebecca Hamilton. If you love paranormal romance or any YA series you will love this book as much as I do. From the first pages it had me sucked in and not wanting to put it down.<br /><br />The Forever Girl explores a whole new world of vampires, witches and other paranormal creatures. This is not the typical vampire book, Rebecca takes the world of vampires to a whole new level. Right from the beginning you know that Sophia is far from normal and is not the typical teenage girl in a YA series.  She is 22 and is very strong willed girl. She has her own mind and knows for the most part who she is and what she wants. When Sophia starts to hear voices and thinks she is going insane she starts to dig into her family history. Sophia starts to find answers and things that she was not expecting to find. Insert Charles who is mysterious and protective all at the same time.  Charles tries to help Sophia discover her past, while trying to keep her safe from the dangerous people trying to find them. Their are parts in this book I caught myself rooting for Charles he is absolutely adorable and there are some defiant must reads in the book between Sophia and Charles will make you wanting more. The supporting characters are just as captivating in their roles.<br /><br />The Forever Girl is a book that I was absolutely drawn into. If you like any type of YA paranormal romance or urban fantasy I would highly recommend The Forever Girl. I cannot wait to read more from Rebecca Hamilton and I am defiantly looking forward the next book in the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|CP is a great basic calculator!  It takes advantage of the Kindle's screen size which makes using CP a \\"plus\\" when using for balancing a check book or other household math projects.  (If you're needing a scientific calculator this is not the app for you.)
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|This may well be my favorite Fiona Apple album, and I preface this by saying I don't particularly *love* any of her albums.  She's just always left me a bit cold.  I don't enjoy some of the arrangements on \\"When the Pawn...\\" and \\"Extraordinary Machine\\"----like being in a video game about a lounge singer.  Her lyrics also sometimes grate on my nerves (not until the last two albums in question did I realize how much I hate the words \\"folderol\\" and \\"derring-do\\").  For me, then, this album shows a progression from \\"Tidal\\" with these two annoyances from the other records scaled back in favor of an improvisational feel.  It's not so much about what she's saying as much as it is about feeling like you're hearing a conversation.  It's not for everyone, but it works.  The piano playing is very percussive and the range of her vocals is impressive.  And the layered effect of \\"Hot Knife\\" makes for a perfect closing.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was initially hard to follow, as it goes back and forth between two different times in the heroine's life (the here and now, and her dark time).  Normally, if I find a book difficult at the beginning, I put it down; however, the plot was too captivating so I read on, and I'm so glad I did!  This book will take you into the depths of psychological thrilling at it's best!!!  Loved it!  Also enjoyed the ending.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First of all, the ridiculous amount of 5-star reviews (of which this one is included) are justified. While being paid to write misleading reviews might catch the eye of someone as poor as I am, I can pretty much guarantee that anyone who posted a 5-star review of WOOL has happily done it gratis.<br /><br />Secondly, the title, while vague and a bit confusing, deals with the stories in many different ways. Not only is wool prominent in the method of cleaning the only view of the outside world, but also alludes to pulling the wool over one's eyes. Not everything is as it seems.<br /><br />Now for the review;<br /><br />Something has happened. The series starts out focused on the lives of humans eking out an existence inside a hundred plus story deep silo buried in the earth. While most people live their lives inside, reminded of the barren destruction outside by huge panels that beam live video on the topmost floor, those that express the idea of going out... get their wish. No matter how much they fight or admit that they won't clean the cameras of the dust and dirt that gradually disrupt the view, they always do. Sent outside in the best atmospherically protective suits, each and every person sent to 'clean' expires.<br /><br />Being human though, there is always hope. Starting with one set of characters, WOOL 1 introduces us to the silo and how things work. (i.e. there are NO elevators... travel is made by using the spiral staircase that goes from top to bottom, sometimes taking days)<br /><br />The rest of the stories introduce us to more characters (each one fleshed out and instantly recognizable) and the intrigue and suspense of the silo. Hugh weaves a story fraught with danger and excitement and leaves you wanting more at every twist in the plot. There were times I caught myself reading at three in the morning because I literally could not put the story down.<br /><br />While Hugh has already written the sixth story in the series, (more of a prequel) he has at least two more in plans. The biggest draw of the series is the fact that Hugh gives you so much information and a visual picture of the silo and its people, but leaves you asking questions... seeking for more. When he does answer a question, five more pop up. The excitement of finding out what happened to send these people into the depths, their struggles and lives, and joining in on the mystery of what will become of them is what hooks you and doesn't let go.<br /><br />While being independently published, there are zero negatives in saying that. You will be pleasantly surprised and excited to read WOOL. I'm only sorry I couldn't give it ten stars.least two more in plans.

B00493E1GI|2.0|Shallow and self centered and in the end misses the opportunity to be inspired.<br /><br />In conclusion to the search, this lovely, supposedly enlightened women, still needed a man to feel complete or okay.  The message being no matter how successful and beautiful, a women needs a man.<br /><br />So 1960's message and disempowering.

1400069289|3.0|Well-written and interesting in a superficial Malcolm Gladwelly way. Great anecdotes.<br /><br />Useful information for changing your own habits or the habits of others (marketing)? Not so much.<br /><br />In short, it's an excellent read if you need to burn some free time. A disappointment if you are a busy person looking for something practical.
0451196716|1.0|This is was honestly one of the worst books I've ever read. I recently got on a Stephen King kick, and read (and enjoyed) The Stand (complete and uncut) followed by 11/22/63. I chose this one to read next since it seemed to have some pretty good reviews.<br /><br />BAD.IDEA. There is no better way to describe the plot than \\"a long walk.\\" It was as dull as watching paint dry.<br />100 kids go on a walk. They walked 5 miles. One died. They walked 5 more miles. Another dies. That's essentially how it reads. Just repeat that for 400 pages.<br /><br />I don't know who in their right mind is recommending this garbage, but save your sanity. Avoid it at all costs. Read one of the two mentioned previously, or Insomnia or Dreamcatcher - books by King I've read and loved (although I was greatly disappointed in the ending for The Stand, I'd still recommend it).<br /><br />This book is an embarassment to Stephen King's collection.

B0086DBE62|2.0|Not worth your time or money, definitely expected more. Julia Roberts must not have even read the script before agreeing to this one.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I was thinking this movie would sort of be like \\"Cast Away\\" or a Hollywood rendition of the \\"Alive\\" story... or something along the lines of the Shackleton story, which actually had a low budget film made about it (The British explorer ship \\"Endurance\\" that was shiprecked on the South Pole in the early 1900's).  Something along those lines. Man vs. his elements.  In that regard, it was along the same lines as \\"Cast Away\\", though the elements were much more dangerous, and the movie, not nearly as good.  I have to admit it though, I wasn't too familar with this Iam Neeson figure, but he did a good job. He was about the one good thing about the movie.  Script is very poor.  If I was Neeson, I'd be looking for another agent.<br /><br />Hint: wait til the credits end.  It's not much but it may give a very small clue.  I really think the movie ended the way it did was because the writer was of high school drama student quality and doesn't know how to make a movie.  Cast Away, or even \\"Endurance,\\" which surprisingly has very high review ratings on Amazon, are better than this, if that's the kind of movie you're looking for.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW!! This is a GREAT book...I could not put it down.<br />I am not usually the kind to read romance novels, However this one is a little different.  This book has some kinky parts that will make you blush as well as parts which just make you smile due to the magnetic attraction the main characters have.  It is a love story, but also has a mysterious aspect as you discover some of the dark history which has caused this sexy, billionaire to be the way he is.<br />You will LOVE it!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|As a fantasy read, this is fun, fabulous and addictive. Not only do I see the appeal, but I feel it as well, and it takes a great book to do that.  If you're a literary snob, or particular about \\"correct writing styles\\" you won't much enjoy this book at all.  For all the other millions of women around the globe, grab yourself a copy, you won't be disappointed.
0061714372|5.0|I simply couldnt put the book down - it was a perfect read and offered such a rich history on two bands i have loved for quite some time.  He is completely open and honest which i imagine must have been difficult as he has two childeren who i am sure have read it as well.  He pulls no punches for others and especially not for himself.  The most fastinating aspect of the way the book is written, however, is you really feel as though you could have been there with him.<br /><br />Its always important to get both sides of a story since the media tends to pick in advance who they support and who they dont and are so influential in developing peoples opinions.  I have always liked Dave - met him once breifly at a table signing and was actually quite shocked when he looked every fan in the eyes as he shook their hands and said hello like he actually cared (rather than just grabbing the item from each person and quickly signing while carrying on a conversation with someone on his side of the table).  Still, he is often depicted by various media outlets and by younger infatuated (with) Metallica fans as something less important than he actually is.<br /><br />I have heard his jabs at Metallica but if you look hard enough you will see there have been quite a few from them sent in his direction as well. Well, after reading this you may have a different opinion on whose are understandable (though perhaps misplaced) and whose are disgruntled.  Afterall - Metallica has only released 7 \\"new material\\" albumns in 29 years WITHOUT Mustaine credited songs being included and Megadeth just released #13 within 25 years - not counting their small hiatus in the early 2000's.  I love them both - dont get me wrong - but i now have a much deeper appreciation and respect for Dave than i did before.

0345803485|1.0|It has been said before ... this is fan fiction (of Twilight) at it's worst. No plot, horribly repetitive, boring characters.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Just want to add to the many who are raving about the new Beach Boys album, \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\". Of course there are plenty of fun tracks that hearken back to the Beach Boys heyday of surf, sun and fun, but there are a few gems included as well that will bring to mind the more melancholy side of Brian Wilson. Namely \\"Summer's Gone\\", \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"From There To Back Again\\". I could listen to these 3 songs in consecutive order all day long. Though \\"Strange World\\" is high on my list of favorites as well. Overall though I feel it is an extremely solid album and enjoy every track from start to finish. I know this was technically supposed to be the band's last hurrah, but I am hoping they will still \\"have more to say\\" in the future, if this is what we can expect!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Pissed I spent nearly $10 dollars on a book that clearly didn't end. (Wants you to buy the next one,Ugh!)  Thankful that the BDSM was mild as it is not really my thing. Only bought it since a friend recommended it.  Sex scenes were ok. The female character is obviously a submissive but seems to genuinely care about the guy.  The guy obviously needs help. Why keep going back and forth. (Ugh!) I think it's a best-seller because 'people' keep buying it. Don't know why, there wasn't much of a plot. Love the cover, though. I won't pay $10 for another book.  This was WAY overpriced.  Want my money back.
B007PPE086|3.0|My kids love love love these dolls. The only problem I have found with them is they are not meant to be played with at all roughly. They are easily damaged. We bought the lagoona blue and had it for only a few hours when the arm broke. You are supposed to be able to remove the arms and legs to put close on over the \\"fins\\" and the peg that holds the arm in pulled right off. I had another that the head popped off just by turning the head around too much. These are for older kids who respect their toys. Do not buy for little ones. They will not last. They may not anyway.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I first heard about this movie when researching Joseph Kony during the Invisible Children and Kony 2012 mania.<br /><br />Looking at the reviews of the relatively few people that saw it during its theater release and those being overwhelmingly positive, seeing who was in it and looking at the track record of the companies behind it, I just could not understand why this had such limited exposure.  I also didn't understand why it took exponentially longer for the movie to be released on DVD.<br /><br />I still don't understand it.<br /><br />Finally having the opportunity to watch it, it is an incredible movie.  Gerard Butler was outstanding in portraying Sam Childers and the transformation in his life.  You saw him become a different person.<br /><br />Yes, the beginning is gritty and raw, but that is the way life is.  God saves and transforms, even the vilest.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" was written by a man, [[ASIN:0825433193 John Newton]], who came from similar depths.<br /><br />I think the movie also does a good job exposing the situation in Southern Sudan and Uganda.<br /><br />The one thing that I have an issue with is that the writers/director wanted to use the story, but then tried to negate the source of motivation and transformation.  Three fourths of the way through, they portray Childers as losing faith, rejecting God, and doing it on his own power.  Childers said in an interview that it didn't happen.<br /><br />There is something about the reality of God working in people's lives that Hollywood can't handle and has to try to neutralize.  The same thing happened in the story of C. S. Lewis, [[ASIN:0783113315 Shadowlands]].  The writers had to try to completely negate the driving force of Lewis's life, and as a result, they completely failed to capture the essence of who he was.<br /><br />MGP doesn't go as far as that.  Butler does a much better presentation of Childers than Hopkins did of Lewis.  It does go a little Rambo at the end, maybe overly so.  But I do like during the credits that they show photos of the actual orphanage, Deng, and Childer's wife and daughter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. of course some games aare betterbybsm others but seriously there are some awesome ones!!! get this app now!
B005LAII0I|3.0|I was expecting this to be a comedy, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so campy.  It was fun, pleasant, but there were quite a few wrong notes.  I can't decide if it was the editing or the writing, I think it might have been a little of both.  Some of the dialogue were real groaners and some parts seem overworked.<br /><br />Overall, it could have been better but it wasn't bad.  If the Princess Bride is the gold standard of fantasy comedy at a 5 and Stardust being a 4, this would be a 3 with Drew Barrymore's Ever After being a 3.5.<br /><br />I thought Julia Roberts was good in the movie.  I liked that the Snow White wasn't a victim in the movie.<br /><br />I'll watch it again, but it won't end up being a favorite.  I do appreciate that it was something that I could let my kids watch without cringing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love the Ice Age movies,  I think this is a great game.  I can't stop playing it.  I can't wait to see the next movie.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|very inspirational. far exceeded my expectation. growing up I have watched countless martial art movies yet still very much impressed by this movie. I'm surprised I have never heard of it before seeing it today and decided to give it a try. Great storyline and martial arts choreography. Bear through the beginning, it gets better as the movie goes on.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Pretty fun game. Some stuff requires real money. So if your cheap like me then that Sucks. That's my only complaint so far.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A wonderful love story!! I couldn't put these books down.  My absolute favorite books I've read in a very long time.  I will definately be reading these books again.
B005OTYSW8|5.0|We Love the Vampire Diaries. Hope all of season 3 will be put on TV or on DVD. It is one of the best my husband has found for both of us to watch. The people that play the parts are just great.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I completely agree. I spent hours reading this book...refusing to put it down.  After I read the last page, I was angry that it ended so abruptly. The book has so many twists and turns and builds up such an amazing story line and I was really disappointed with the main characters as well as the author for ending such a fantastic novel in such a terrible way.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I have been looking for Celine singing Beautiful Boy for 2 years.  What a voice and what a song.  I will probably wear this out before long.  The little picture book is so adorable.  Thank you Amazon for introducing me to shopping from my air-conditioned home during a heat wave. Just think of the gas I'm going to save so I can spend more at Amazon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|While I agree with some of the things some of the other reviewers have said, the bottom line for me was that this series was spell-binding, whether it had poor editing or not! I just could not put it down and didn't want it to end. Some have said that Ana had no back bone, but I disagree. She was just what Christian needed. She did stand up to him throughout the entire series. That's why they ended up arguing so much.<br /><br />Yes, there is quite a bit of repetition, but here again, it lightened the mood of this dark tale of a tormented man, who suffered terrible abuse at the beginning of his most formative years, and again at the tender age of fifteen when his hormones were going haywire. I felt there was tremendous growth in both these characters, especially at the end.<br /><br />I loved Ana's subconscious and her inner goddess. They added some humor to what was actually a deeply emotional story. I loved the epilogue, and I will defintely re-read these books again. That's very unusual for me, since I normally read historical romance!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Really enjoyed the books. 2/3 through book 5 already. George R R Martin is a great author with a subtlety for back story.<br /><br />My only real gripe with this is the formatting. The \\"TOC\\" just links to each of the books, which then have their own TOCs that you have to book mark on your own if you want a quick link to them. I think the format makes it difficult to track your progress within each book, and I think its difficult to differentiate between books because I had a tendancy to dive right in to the next book because of the format.<br /><br />If I were to do it all again I would probably pay the extra 5-6$ and buy the books separately.
0380973839|5.0|I had no idea that this was a set of short stories.  Awesome book!  Fast shipping and the product was in great condition too.  Thanks!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|very cool app. It has great potential and amazing results in the hands of people more artistic than myself. I would recommend this app to anyone interested in mobile phone photography
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app on kindle fire and my phone.  The only issue I ever have is it gets a little glichy sometimes. Other than that I love it!!!
0671027344|5.0|Amazing. I loved it so much I finished it in two days! Chbosky hits issues I dealt with spot on in my high school years. It's the type of book that makes you think for days after and you'll always learn something new when re-reading it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You wont regret getting this app. that will supply hours of enjoyment. This game is so addicting it will help pass the time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Word of warning- DON'T start this omnibus at 11:00 o'clock at night.. I was up 'til 3:30 AM desperately trying to finish it.<br /><br />What I think I like best about the book is the slow methodical revelation of the full picture.. As a reader you learn the situation as the characters learn. Even the sense of scale is expertly revealed. I won't go into any more details so as not to give spoilers other than to say it's the best $5.99 I've spent for sheer entertainment value. Very, very well written, excellent 3 dimensional characters, believable plot, plausible science.
8866130109|5.0|I don't care if people think Moleskines are overpriced. They are the best sketchbook out there and I would never use any other kind

B007L6VR12|5.0|As I was leaving the theater I promised myself to see it again. It was that good. That was a week ago.  Now I'm thinking I'm going to buy the DVD.  Wes Anderson get's it.
1936608898|5.0|Love this book! Although it covers some pretty detailed scientific info about how the body processes food, it does so in such a simple and approachable manner that a general audience can easily understand the reasons behind the authors' dietary recommendations.  Following the dietary recommendations takes a LOT of discipline, but anyone who powers through the Whole30 will see results that will provide the necessary motivation for long-term change.
0374530718|5.0|Many of my friends who have started this book told me they just gave up, and that it was \\"too confusing\\".<br />When I finally picked up this book to read over the summer, I realized they were right: it was a difficult read. The \\"lessons on philosophy\\" Sophie (the protagonist) receive are very complex and require the reader to put the book down once in a while to sort out in their minds.<br /> This is a good book for those who feel like they get through a book too quickly, and a great book for philisophy lovers. I'm both, so I enjoyed reading this book very much, although it did give me some headaches as I struggled to understand the philosophy courses as well as follow Sophie's search for a mysterious girl.

1466208686|5.0|For anybody preparing for a technical interview, this should be like the Holy Grail. The book tells you all the topics that you should know, and then gives you problems of varying difficulty levels. The good about this book is that it doesn't contain much of the basics, which people going into interviews should already know. It's also a great way to brush up on your skills and thinking process if you haven't done coding interviews in a while. Almost every question I've gotten in a coding interview (from Google, Apple, Amazon, Zynga), I have all seen in here before. If you know this book well, you'll be good to go. The most important thing about technical interviews is practice and a sense of mental preparedness, and this book is the best tool for accomplishing that.
0439023513|5.0|People that are rating this book a one star are disappointed with lack of a magical happily ever after. Well I am sorry that this book was not your fix from the harsh reality of war. People die and the ones who survive are not only scarred on the outside but on the inside as well. There is no happily-ever-after!<br /><br />Collins did an amazing job! Take this for what it is a close look at our self-destructive selfs in time of war through the eyes of a 17 year-old, not a love triangle story where the girl gets to keep the best friend and the lover. If that's what you're looking for, go read Breaking Dawn.
0307887448|4.0|All the reviews about this book being a captivating read are more than true. The idea of being able to live in a virtual world is an interesting concept, and who wouldn't want to root for the underdog main character? However, given that the book is centered around a lot of 80's references, these references might lose their magic for those who are not familiar with them. It definitely makes things a lot more enjoyable if you understand them, but I found that it didn't matter much even if you didn't understand them. The characters and the story were enough to help me turn the pages.
0345803485|1.0|It is very rare that I stop reading a book halfway through but 50 Shades of Grey was a notably awful exception. EL James' disasterpiece is Twilight fan fiction so naturally it was poorly written and the primary male character was a misogynistic pig. Unlike Twilight however, 50 Shades of Grey wasn't even remotely entertaining. As a serious word of warning, anyone who has ever been a victim of sexual violence should avoid this book entirely (though the relationship portrayed in 50 Shades of Grey was essentially consensual.)
B001K3K5MO|5.0|This movie I give five stars and is why I still have not written off Tom Cruise. This movie is so cool to me, I love the high tech. and jet action. The movie shows American military excellence for which I am still impressed.
1401223176|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this story and it kept me guessing until the end.  It's also a fun tour de force that lets several of Batman's great villains share the spotlight for a bit.  Visually, the artwork really shines with interesting perspectives and fine detailing.  In particular, I liked the style of showing ghosted animations of the more acrobatic characters so you could get a real sense of how they did that cool flip move.  Though I'm relatively new to the world of comics, this is easily one of the best arcs I've read.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Love the game. Plays easier than computer version. Huge downside...it's completely wiped out my game 2x, sons game as well. Big let down to have to start over. Will score 5 when problem is fixed.

B004AUGJS8|1.0|This was one bad movie...a-list actors relegated to b-movie parts...WHY<br />The only thing that kept this movie watchable was Kirsten Dunst
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|This is a great new release by the Asia guys. I've been listening since 1982 and I agree with many of the reviewers that these songs are well crafted with great music and lyrics. This album apparently is being compared to their first and hailed as just as good. It's good, but it does lack the strong guitar work of the first album. Sure, Howe is great on XXX but there's nothing near the guitar work of Time Again, for example. This is the best cd the originals have put out since their reunion.<br /><br />I negatively critiqued Omega because it was a pop album with a few exceptions. XXX is outstanding, enough said except, Steve, I must ask, can't you give us a bit of some harder guitar?

B004O3YGMC|4.0|Sometimes not responsive but reliable most of the time. Would be great if you could access computers from other computers.
1932907009|2.0|The cover is sad! I do not like to see any animal dangling at the end of a rope,...let alone a cat. To say that this is \\"The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need,\\" is an even more pathetic statement! There are many books on screenwriting, and this is merely one of them. Some people will like it, and others will not! However, writing takes much more than a formula. Some writers are talented by nature,---however writing is much like any other talent: It has to be cultivated and practiced. Each writer has his, or her own voice and style. It is sad that screenwriting and in some instances, all other writing has become a formula in order to make money, and only money, --- disregarding everything else. This is exactly why so many movies these days are so very, very bad,...because the writing is bad! Gone are the days of Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Ararbia, etc. If someone wishes to become a screenwriter, they need to sit down and to read past screenplays, watch classic movies, read books on writing, study cinema history, and even attend some proper writing classes. Yes, it is indeed hard work, and it does take much more than a formula to produce good writing. Even though this book will lead you to believe otherwise. Most importantly, when one sits down to write,--- one must feel and believe---what one is writing. Not see the dollar ($) signs with each word typed. Writing is much more than a formula. Somehow, the public has been lead to believe otherwise. Sad day for writers! Sad day for humanity! Most of all,---a very sad day for that poor cat on the cover!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This works great. I don't use it often but when I do it does all that I need. I have the free version and it tested great. Will be paying for the full version so I can have https for google, email, etc.
B004QWKIYQ|5.0|With his smooth backup band, Bruno is such a talented and charismatic performer! I sure am glad I bought this Import with the added songs. It plays fine in all of my various Cd players.
B005JLNALG|4.0|There is no doubt that this is Road Salt Two. If you liked Part One, you will like Two, and it will grow on you. A little more Beatle-esque with some violin or orchestra-like instrumental theme portions. Merge them together into a single release on your iPod.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Ted is a laugh out loud comedy. And one of the funniest movies to come down the pipe in years. Its the simple story of one man and a foul mouthed animated Teddy bear. I highly recommend that all movie goers see this outrageously funny movie.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|If you haven't guessed yet, I like this album and think it deserves a solid recommendation.  I'm a fan of only the original Asia (I cannot be convinced to waste my time with the Payne albums).  Comparisons to the debut album really don't make any sense to me, other that it's the same guys playing.  The sound of this album is clearly 21st century Asia.  If you think that is a bad thing, I can't help you there.  Initially I wasn't feeling the album, but now that I've been listening to it constantly for a week I'm now addicted to it (remember that feeling?).  There are very catchy songs here, and in a just radio environment there would be at least several hit singles here.  The reviewers who are giving low ratings and complain about this record I would bet good money they didn't give it a chance and/or didn't listen on a decent stereo.  If you are a fan of Asia, don't you think you owe it to the band just out of respect to give it a fair chance?  If you are not a fan of just this record but love the band, the same logic applies - listen to it over at least a week!  This record grows on you quick I promise.  For me it's better than Omega, which I thought was half a good record.<br /><br />I don't think it was ever cool to be a fan of Asia.  But thankfully Asia fans love the combination of heavy 80's sounding keyboards without apology.  You get that with XXX.  I'm a big fan of Steve Howe (his Yes mode and his Asia mode), and although I feel he could be more prominent in some of the songs, you get some good Howe on XXX.  Wetton's singing is as good as ever, which is quite an amazing thing IMO.  The voice has almost gotten stronger, I dare say.  The cool surprise is I hear the bass playing on my system more than on other Asia records.  I never realized how good a bass player Wetton is until this record.  The drumming is a bit low in the mix, but still great.  Conclusion:  Fans must pick this up and GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE.  Don't be an instant hater like all the negative reviewers here. My favorite tracks are:<br /><br /> Bury Me In Willow<br /> Face On The Bridge<br /> Al Gatto Nero<br /> Reno(Silver and Gold)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's extremely robust...I have it installed on my iPhone, iPad, Mac and Kindle fire...now my notes are with me wherever I go, regardless of what device I use to create or edit.
0385534639|5.0|Really, just an amazingingly wonderful story; yes, you know where it's going (if you're paying attention) but like any good tale, you wait, you relish it, and when the end comes, it's still completely thoroughly enjoyable. And while I know the writer will be tempted to continue the story, PLEASE DON'T. It's like one of those absolutely perfect from beginning to end, \\"god I love every song on this frickin' album!!!\\" kinda books. Don't tell others about it- let them come to it in their own; don't hype it- it's better than hype and deserves true lovers of Stories to fully comprehend what's at stake. God forbid they make a movie out of it!!<br /><br />Read this, 'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell', then 'The Bedlam Detective', then the Johannes Cabal series and then 'The Book of Air and Shadows' and man- was that ever the most magical week or what?!?!
B000Q7ZND6|2.0|Was happy to recieve the dvd fast but the quality (both image and sound) doesn't match to any of the blu ray discs I have at home.<br />Looks like someone labeled DVD as bluray.
0307938905|5.0|Many reviews have been written but I just had to put mine in ..... so that tells you something of what you will find.  It is very different from anything I have read - even of this genre and I have the first printing of the Circus of Dr. Lao.  The book is so engrossing so that I was immersed in a different place - exactly what I want in a book.  The characters are not what I loved...they are well done.  It is the atmosphere, the visual images, the complete transportation to somewhere \\"else\\".  I savored the book.  Left it on my nightstand and couldn't wait to go to bed to go back to London, Paris, Munich, Venice, etc. etc.  If I missed a night, I could easily slip back into the glossy depths again effortlessly.  I didn't want it to end because I had to stop visiting and learning and discovering new and delicious ideas of things I have never thought of.  So. Said enough.
B002WTC92E|1.0|I've never met a series of characters I liked less than Leigh, Adrianna and Emmy. How were they friends? I found them shallow and vapid. I didn't warm to the characters or enjoy the story line at all - if I hadn't been stuck on a train for a number of hours, I would have tossed it.
B0086700CM|1.0|It crashes every time I try to open it! How am I suppose to play this if I can't even get it? I was so excited when I saw that it was for android but I can't play!
B0086700CM|1.0|I luv this game but idk y its not letting me download it ive been playing on my itouch instead!!!!!!!
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I loved the first half of the book.  The storyline was engaging and I loved the friendship between Travis and Abby.  After they became lovers the storyline was so twisted I could hardly stand to finish the book.  I give 5 stars for the first half of the book and 0 stars for the second, even with the so called HEA.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am hooked on this series....!!!!..Book two gets more into the personal lives of the two main characters. It is extremely easy reading and you just can't put the book down. I can't wait to finish this book and start reading the next book in the series...This is a great read for any woman....You will love it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it can play almost every day I even played this on my neighbors I pad I just love the game!
0062183591|5.0|This was an intriguing and occasionally amusing book about the behavior of dishonesty and how dishonest people are in general. The author provided a variety of experiments and show cases where he demonstrated that there is some degree of dishonest in most people's behavior, though not so much that everyone is a thief or a crook. A lot of dishonesty ends up being based partially on altruism and in general people don't always weigh the benefit of being dishonest, so much as decide to do so for less rational reasons. It's a book I'd recommend anyone read to better understand the role of dishonesty in our lives, and how it shows up in our own behaviors as well as the behavior of people around us. It can also be useful as a way of looking at dishonesty on the level of an organization and business, though the author doesn't offer too much in the ways of solutions for handling dishonesty, so much as demonstrating its presence in our lives.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is definitely my favorite version of manning I've ever played out of all the options in the appetite. I would and have recommended it to my friends.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|This is just about everything a P.O.D. album should be: hard-hitting, groovy, realistic, hopeful, and diverse.  It's not clear that the band has a better album out in their career, and that's saying something.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot on my Kindle Fire. At first I had a problem with the glitches mentioned by others,  but it's been fixed and works great now.
1475143389|5.0|Bigger Leaner Stronger is the best weight lifting book I've found.  It's very to the point, which I appreciated.  I'm a 49 year old female and am new to weight lifting.  About three months ago I started working with a personal trainer.  We did 13 sessions together.  Mike Matthews book reiterated what I had been learning and gave me great additional information.  But the book is written for males, so I had a couple of questions.  I emailed Mr. Matthews, and he was so kind to write back and thoughtfully answer me!  Now I really feel equipped with the information I need to get back to the gym and work even harder!  I'm SO thrilled I found this book!  And he said he's now writing one specifically for us gals!!!

B002TQ3OBU|4.0|This album was the last in Porcupine Tree's initial psychedelic style; with the next album, \\"Signify\\", major changes would begin. Many people have drawn comparisons with Pink Floyd; certainly the opening section of the first song has a very Floydian vibe. But overall the album is not a Floyd clone at all, being squarely within the neo-psych territory of PT's earlier \\"Up The Downstair\\" and \\"Voyage 34\\", with trance-dance sections intermingling with pastoral guitars and sound collages dominating the two \\"phases\\" of the title track. \\"Dislocated Day\\" is straight-ahead wah-ified psychedelic rock. \\"The Moon Touches Your Shoulder\\" is probably the song that is closest to Floyd in character, with it's low-to-high build; but it is more the Floyd of \\"More\\" than anything else.<br /><br />The album is uneven, however. Many of the instrumental sections sound a bit too much like noodling - good sounding noodling, but noodling nonetheless. \\"Sky Moves Sideways Phase 1\\" and \\"Dislocated Day\\" are two of the best songs of the entire pre-Signify era; but \\"Moon\\" developed better as a live song (available on \\"Coma Divine\\"), and the majority of everything after that on disk 1 is dispensible.  The alternate version of SMS on disk 2 is really only of historical interest, while \\"Moonloop\\" is another song that improved with age as it was played live. \\"Stars Die\\" is however, a very nice low-key ballad.<br /><br />So really my rating should probably be 3 1/2, because two-thirds of this total package is rather mediocre by PT standards. That does not mean that it is bad, or that it will send you frantically reaching for the OFF on your remote; it just tends to fade out on you after a while. So that is 3 material. But \\"Sky Moves Sideways Phase 1\\" and \\"Dislocated Day\\" are solid 5 material and \\"Stars Die\\" is a good 4. So there you are. If you are unfamiliar with PT's earlier style, this is still probably the best album of that group to start with. To overall PT fans, the first two tracks are worth theprice of admission alone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Boring writing, bland, and just a romance novel with \\"kinky\\" sex for girls who never grew up. Being harsh, yes, but it's true.<br /><br />Another stupid story of a girl swooped up by the richest, most amazing man on the planet. Haven't we outgrown the fairy tales? They weaken us as women and as people.<br /><br />There is a wealth of amazing erotica written by exceptional writers.  This book  is not one of them.

Everyone is different and if we liked all the same things then the world would just be boring.  I saw the midnight release to this movie so I wasn't really focused at the time while watching it.  Re-watching it was so much better and now I can't wait for the second release.

B004184JZO|4.0|I just got this today; it arrived in a very timely manor--I actually expected it Wednesday, so it came as an early surprise.<br /><br />Opening the figure, I was mildly shocked to see how small it was. The pictures make it out to be much larger, but in reality, it's maybe 6\\" tall. I should have read the other reviews which make a note of this, but I also feel that its size should be in the product description.<br /><br />The character comes with an unopened facehugger egg, a stand, and a little \\"Warrior Alien\\" plaque. It all fits together quite well, though I wish the base had more room on it to pose the Xeno's feat. I think it would be hard to get the Xeno to stand without the stand, but I haven't really tried. Its feat are pretty small though.<br /><br />The Xeno is sculpted almost perfectly from the show, but there are a few flaws, most notable in that it only has three fingers instead of six. The oddities on the forearms are also not present in the old movies, but the toy comes with other arms that can be subbed in. The spike on the end of the tail also seems somewhat off, though I haven't exactly verified if it's movie perfect or not.<br /><br />The coloring is also something worth noting. The creature, in full light, is more brown and translucent than blue/black and opaque. Once you get it in the dark though, it turns into the correct color and has the sort of drippy/slimy sheen that is to be expected.<br /><br />It's very pose-able, though the joints feel flimsy. I wouldn't say they are flimsy, but they feel that way, and after spending so much on this figure, I'd rather not risk anything.<br /><br />I really do like it though, and I have it on my bookshelf near my scifi books (which include the Dark Horse Alien novels). It looks very menacing there, yet oddly cute due to its small stature. I feel like I need to buy a Predator for it to fight now.

0345803485|1.0|Terrible writing, repetitive and annoying!  Anna is a naive waste of skin and Christian is a control freak and a stalker!  I can't believe this crappy book is on the best sellers list!
034580404X|1.0|...but instead I just forced myself to actually read the whole trilogy, which is enough punishment in itself. I bought the hype.<br /><br />  The basic premise of the Fifty Shades saga is that a beautiful but-doesn't-know-it girl named Anastasia Steele interviews a young and handsome-beyond-the-lot-of-mortal-men billionaire named Christian Grey and they become instantly infatuated with one another (of course) but things get complicated when she finds out he wants her to be the sexual submissive to his dominant.<br /><br />***Some Spoilers Ahead***<br /><br />  What lured me in was the BDSM aspect...I thought I'd be reading a sexy and sophisticated story about what consenting adults pushing the limits can do to one another with some dark undertones but instead what I got was some repetitive, boring tripe about two vapid idiots whose main interests are telling each other constantly how hot they find one another and obsessing over each other to a degree matched only by Bella and Edward from Twilight.<br /><br />  I did not expect Fifty Shades to be high art...but I was hoping for entertaining escapism and it just didn't happen. Some of it was due to minor annoyances like American characters using British expressions and phrasing on a regular basis and Christian Grey's eyes being...well, grey, but other issues are too large for this reader to overlook. Apparently in the world of Fifty Shades any member of the opposite sex who is not related to Ana or Christian or their best friend has to lust for them and many of the same expressions are used excessively. Christian's twitching palm, Ana thinking jeez and Holy (fill in the expletive/noun) were used so often I found myself judging the editing as much as the writing. Ana is a very inexperienced virgin prior to her relationship with Christian but can somehow orgasm on command and embraces right away the lighter aspects of bondage and rough sex. Christian is a dominant because of an early troubled childhood and an older woman took advantage of him in his teens, teaching him the ways of BDSM, with the implication being only really damaged people desire this kind of thing. Ana is supposedly independent and ethical but when faced with some of the creepy, stalkerish tendencies Christian exhibits she offers half-hearted, brief resistance and then capitulates wholly because after a week, she loooooves him so much. E L James also only lets you know how much her characters love one another by having them profess it unendingly to one another and frankly, she has to because nothing about the actions of how these two relate to one another would make me infer it. She doesn't write with enough passion to sell me on the love story and the sex scenes, which I have no objection to in a story, reused so many of the same concepts and language that I found myself bored by them.<br /><br />***End Of Spoilers***<br /><br />  I felt like there were some good bones to this story but the potential is wasted by an insipid heroine and a hero who embodies all the worst aspects of Edward from Twilight and Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights. Obviously there are people that love this story enormously and I would not be at all surprised to hear the film rights have already been purchased, but it does disappoint me when I see how by-the-numbers this is. You only get one first impression, and considering the bad taste I am still trying to spit out from Fifty Shades, I won't be reading an E L James offering again.

There's not much I can say with my 5-star rating that others haven't already covered, but the chemistry of the actors on set with each other, the setting, and the shark is just awe-inspiring. The way the movie can morph from drama to comedy to action in a nanosecond never fails to impress me. Sometimes you don't know whether to laugh at Quint or be a little frightened. The way the shark is a constant presence throughout the movie without being shown much at all is amazing. All in all, a must-watch, and even a must-have.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What has happened to the reading public? To rate this above one star is pitiful. There is nothing about this book that redeems the terrible writing, the lack of plot, the poor dialogue, the laughable \\"eroticism,\\" and the complete lack of character development. The writing is juvenile. None of the characters are likeable or in fact believable. The grammatical and stylistic errors are an embarrassment to the author and the editors. I understand this started as fanfiction for the Twilight series. The names we changed and, voila, it's suddenly an original work.<br /><br />What's really unnerving is the number of women who are pining after Christian, and want their husband to emulate him. Really? You want your husband to be verbally, emotionally and physically abusive? Because that's what is happening in this book. She is afraid of him. This is not a D/S relationship. This is abuse, pure and simple. I weep for humanity. It is 2012 and people are still tittilated by trash posing as prose. Shame on the publishers. Shame on the reading public.

B005LAIGPU|1.0|I found chronicle to be rather dumb, the whole thing focused on three HS students one documenting everything on his camera . It's centered around ppl's fascination w/ having super powers especially the ability to fly. I thought it was rather predictable b/c you knew something bad was gonna happen at some point to these 3 punks, and the wimpy kid would use his mighty powers against his abusive father...the one kid becoming obsessed reminded me of the movie Christine, the video camera Cloverfield, flying thru the air Hancock, and of course the stopping bullets in the air was ripped from the Matrix. There was zero explanation of where their powers came from or a better explanation of why their noses kept bleeding. How did the one (most powerful) kid die... when in the diner they tried to stab other dude's hand and it bent the fork and they were crashing thru buildings and such? A very short film, less than an hour & half.  Wouldn't recommend
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I see many reviews out here talking about how unrealistic these characters and scenarios are and I have to completely disagree with those, respectively, of course. I'm not really sure if people truly think that every relationship is like the Cleaver's or cannot see that as dysfunctional on the outside a relationship appears, it's highly functional to the people in it. Many relationships are like Abby & Travis'- maybe not to the same degree but I am willing to bet on it that more are like this than what would have been like Abby & Parker. We all have that person we need and love for our own reasons and I admire this relationship as it unfolded- even at its ugliest. Not every story has Cinderella and Prince Charming as its lead characters. What I saw in these 2 characters is a deep rooted love for one another compounded by their own insecurities and stubbornness. I honestly did not see Travis as violent as the reviews imply he is. Yes, he was possessive of Abby but I think it was in her honor, as we see a very soft side to him just as often. Abby had her flaws, too. Their relationship was not the most ideal and it became painful to witness the hurt and pain they caused each other when you are screaming for them to get their heads out of their a$$es and admit they f-ed up. But in the end, they found that what made them happy was more important that what made them miserable- interesting concept, eh?<br /><br />It's a beautiful love story that tells a tale of two people falling in love, learning how to live with and without one another and how much we, as humans, depend on someone else for that deep connection to our souls.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I bought this book as a result of all the \\"hype\\" that surrounded it.<br />For the first 7-8 chapters I was hooked, mainly because I couldn't wait to get to the \\"juicy\\" scenes as my friends were describing them. However, once you read one sex scene you have read them all and they become very repetitive. There is not much substance to this book and a better editor definitely would not have gone astray. Some of the grammar was simply atrocious to be honest and I found myself getting frustrated at the typos and errors.<br /><br />It is a book that has been marketed and promoted very well, if nothing else. I don't think I will be reading the next two instalments. One was enough for me!

B0052VUNHC|4.0|As I've now read this book about four times, I definitely consider it a bargain at $2.99 for the Kindle edition.  I can't say that it's the best book I've ever read, which is why it gets four stars instead of five, but it does have something that captured my imagination, to the point where I felt like I could really imagine this relationship rolling into life in front of me.<br />Synopsis<br />When Abby Abernathy starts her first year of college, she was not looking for a relationship of any kind with a guy like Travis Maddox, a tattooed, underground fighting ring star, an infamous figure on her small college campus. As her relationship with him develops, we see that Abby is what Travis needs, but that Travis is not who Abby thinks she needs.  The story is about her stubbornness, Travis's demons (inner, that is. This is not a sci-fi story), and how their relationship with one another effects the people around them.<br /><br />The vocab in this book could use some freshening (how many times does someone \\"lilt\\"?) and it's a bit rough around the edges, but all in all, I enjoyed the read.  Abby is by no means a perfect heroine, no matter how Travis sees her, as she often refuses to see the truth right in front of her, and treats Travis rather shabbily because of it, but she is a believable character, one is a credit to her writer, as Abby is convincingly wrought for her age.  She is still a teenager, and this story would be completely different if she did act maturely, but that is simply not who the characters are meant to be.<br />I think most female readers would love, in theory, to have a guy like Travis, who is not only hot, but also someone who loves with all he is.  However, the disturbing parts of the book stem from his violent reactions to innocuous things, and the other college students lack of reaction to these outbursts.  Why would you not react to someone whaling on another guy in the cafeteria. Unsanitary, anyone?  How does Travis not have multiple chargespressed against him.  And how does he expect to go into law enforcement with that temper? These questions will never be answered, which is sad, but for the most part, I concentrated on the development of the bond between hero and heroine, and I wasn't unhappy with the conclusion.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Like many other reviewers, the hype surrounding this trilogy sucked me in and made me read it. First the good points: the passion and chemistry between Anatasia & Christian is evident and brought back memories of my first love. Everyone can relate to the time they lost their virginity however it was unrealistic that somehow Ana manages to score an orgasm first time out the gate...really? Moving on, at times I had to smile at their sarcastic exchanges and I did find Ana's inner goddess comical however it really reminded me of when I was a teenager and unsure of myself. Which brings me the bad points because without even reading the other two books, I can tell how this story will end. If you take away the sex scenes, this is a weak love story and the trilogy could really be one book. Additionally, these sex scenes that everyone is raving about...really? Sex in the shower, on his desk, even the action in his \\"playroom\\" is not anything to gasp over. Any mildy sexually experienced person has surely experienced many of the situations described in this book. Ana's wimpy, indecisive behavior iritated me more than anything and the author making Mr. Grey seemingly the \\"perfect\\" man (rich, handsome, charming, etc) expect for his fetish behavior was disappointing.<br /><br />What really frustrates me about this book is that it doesn't hit the mark neither as a good love story nor as a good erotica novel. It's unrealistic and very predictable. Plus I've never read any of the Twillight books, only watched the movies, and it was CLEAR to me that the two lead characters were based on Bella/Edward which makes this trilogy unoriginal also. It's almost a slap in the face of Stephanie Meyer(author of Twillight saga) and some of the good erotica authors. Although the warning states this is for mature audiences, I disagree. Since it is inspired by Twillight (young teen genre) and the female lead Ana behaves as a teenager not a grown woman, I can easily see how folks can be so divided onthis book.<br /><br />Bottom line, did I enjoy reading this book? Yes. Would I re-read it or read books 2 &3? No. Because in the words of Ana, I want MORE than the 50 shades of gray trilogy can offer.
0345803485|1.0|My girlfriend told me about this trilogy and said it was so great that she couldn't put it down. I've read some erotica before (The Sleeping Beauty trilogy actually written by Anne Rice but under a different pen name), so I was willing to give it a read.<br /><br />Good grief, it was SO BAD, I stopped reading it about half-way through! Someone else here asked if a teenager had written the book, and I agree 100%. The concept is interesting but the sex scenes and the young woman's reactions and emotions are LAUGHABLE. I was shocked to learn that it was written by a woman, because the multiple orgasms the main character has are in some cases physically impossible.<br /><br />If you've never had real sex, you might find this exciting. But if you have, DON'T BOTHER. You'll roll your eyes so many times you'll lose your place on the page.<br /><br />If you are interested in REAL erotica (bordering on pornography, actually), find the Sleeping Beauty trilogy. In those stories, princes and princesses are sent by their parents to be sex slaves for several years before they can take their place among high society. These sex slaves have no choice but to submit and perform as commanded, which makes it all the more exciting (+ repulsive + sick).
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Downloaded to my Android phone (samsung charge) which came with kindle reader.<br />Everything worked great. as a bonus it was free.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I've only just started going through this voluminous set, which I received from Amazon on July 5 (I had pre-ordered it, and it was shipped on the 3rd, which was the official release date until that date actually arrived, and then was moved to the 10th). So far, everything appears to be in order -- the 1949 Eroica opens the whole collection on Disc 1, exactly as it should, and it sounds absolutely glorious (I haven't looked to see if the makers finally gave it the 20-bit remastering treatment promised and not delivered circa 1999). And one thing they definitely did repair was the NBC Symphony recording of the Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6 which, in the 1992 CD series, had audible gouges in the source that made listening a rather painful experience. The Japanese reissue of that performance had no untoward surface noise, but there hasn't been time to compare that with what's here -- but they have remastered this recording from a proper source, if possibly not the same source as the Japanese reissue. The Fidelio even gives us some spatial relationships and room ambience between the singers, not bad for a pre-tape-era recording.<br /><br />As to the overall virtues of the set, for anyone who needs convincing -- and this comes from someone who grew up highly doubtful about the worth of Toscanini's recordings -- some of those performances, such as his 1936 Beethoven Seventh with the Philharmonic, the 1949 Eroica, the Grofe Grand Canyon Suite (no, I'm not joking -- he gets the NBC Symphony to play it like real music, and lo, and behold, IT IS!!!), the Rossini overtures, the Boheme, and all of the Verdi, plus a lot of the Beethoven -- have seldom been equaled. And it's ALL worth owning. The producers, beyond the structural flaws delineated by other reviewers, seem to have gotten this one right -- maybe the 1992 CD art hardly constitutes \\"original jackets,\\" but they had to use something, and if it helped make this project more viable in some way, bravo! And it is a bargain, at anything less than $200 (for those with short memories, back in 1992, the original collection -- which had a lot of sonic deficiencies that have been fixed here -- went for over $1000, and took up a lot more space, although the earlier editions, from 1992 and 1999, also contained extensive essays in each individual volume authored by classical music critic/scholars Harris Goldsmith and Mortimer H. Frank, which are not present in this collection).<br /><br />One should also point out that, despite the thorough nature of this collection, it will still be necessary even for the non-completist to move beyond this box. There were any number of broadcast performances that, for whatever reason, Toscanini never authorized for commercial release in his lifetime. His estate has granted Testament Records access to several volumes of these, and beyond the legitimate, licensed material, there are some issues by Guild, Music & Art, and other labels that fill out a few major gaps in Toscanini's library (perhaps most notably the Brahms Requiem).nything less than $200 (for those with short memories, back in 1992, the original collection -- which had a lot of sonic deficiencies that have been fixed here -- went for over $1000, and took up a lot more space, although the earlier editions, from 1992 and 1999, also contained extensive essays in each individual volume authored by classical music critic/scholars Harris Goldsmith and Mortimer H.

0743496736|1.0|I enjoyed this book and would give it 4 stars for the characters and relationships in the story. These created an underpinning for the plot that made the book dramatic and compelling. But I've read more interesting \\"school shooting\\" stories.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Need-Talk-About-Kevin-Paperback/dp/B003O3E4L6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341945582&sr=1-2&keywords=we+need+to+talk+about+kevin+by+lionel+shriver<br /><br />However I am giving it 1 star.<br /><br />My problem with \\"19 Minutes\\" is that the vast majority of the details of the shooting are directly lifted from Columbine.  Many of the specific events in \\"19 Minuetes\\" actually happened in Colorado.<br /><br />1) The scene when the school teacher gets shot in the stomach was a true, but he was not gay. He may have socialized a local bar, but it wasn't a gay bar.<br /><br />It was true that an eagle scout tried to save his life, but it really was two eagle scouts along with a classroom full of fellow students who tried everything they could to save his life. They even went as far as putting a sign in the window to tell the people outside that someone was dying in that room.<br /><br />2) Both boys at Columbine wrote essays for classes that foreshadowed what they did.  But the tone and content of their work went far beyond the temporized assignment that was in \\"19 Minutes\\".<br /><br />3) While boys at Columbine did not sit down and eat in the cafeteria, they did pick up drinks as they went through. But neither boy was in a dissociative state at the time.<br /><br />4) One mother tragically did go to a gun shop and kill herself with the gun as she was purchasing it.<br /><br />5) One young woman who was a friend/aquaintance of both boys did assist them by procurring guns for them, but she didn't participate in the actual shooting and did not know that it was going to happen.  She didn't shoot anyone<br /><br />6) One student did escape through a window, but he didn't fall to the pavement. He was rescued by fire fighters and lived.  After a long struggle, he was one of the first students to enter Columbine High School when it reopened.<br /><br />7) Both boys turned their cars into bombs, but they failed to go off.<br /><br />8) Many of the students at Columbine High had been in school with each other for years, but that happens in many places.<br /><br />Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were not gay. They were not picked on or teased by bullies and they were not outcasts.  They didn't play sports because they didn't want to. They instead loved their jobs, music, theater and making bombs.<br /><br />What occurred at Columbine was that Eric Harris, a psychopath, chose a weak and depressed buddy, Dylan Klebold, and unsuccessfully attempted a terrorist attack.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Columbine-Dave-Cullen/dp/B004Y6MT96/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1341945417&sr=8-1&keywords=columbine+by+dave+cullen<br /><br />Eric Harris would have laughed long and hard at the foolishness that has followed in his wake. Instead of carrying out a terrorist attack on Columbine High School, he has been the catalyst for cultural change that makes us feel terrorized by nail clippers and toy guns.<br /><br />What \\"19 Minutes\\" does is perpetuate a myth.<br /><br />Even though I enjoyed parts of this book, I believe that Ms. Picoult was creatively lazy and that she shamefully and inaccurately plagerized the truth.

B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|Linkin Park pretty much shook their fanbase to the core when they decided with their 2007 release, Minutes to Midnight, to abandon the Nu Metal subgenre almost entirely: gone were the turn-tables, the rap-rock theme, the beats, and much of the adolescent angst. Mixed reception to the record (though I loved it at the time) did nothing to sway the band's aim to evolve, and they followed it up with A Thousand Suns, a concept album which at times arguably abandoned the rock genre entirely, focusing instead on slow electronics, eerie samples and speeches, and its message. The band commented numerous times when that CD came out that they didn't care what the fanbase thought, that fans who didn't have open minds should \\"listen to something else\\"....and all kinds of stuff to that extent.<br /><br />With what they've put together for Living Things, though, I think we're seeing a slightly humbled Linkin Park who wants to win back at least some of their disillusioned fanbase.<br /><br />In some ways. They still have not gone back to the Nu Metal sound of Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and likely won't ever be. Like with A Thousand Suns, the guitars and percussion have again been covered over with electronics. That said, Living Things has a much heavier and more \\"rock\\" sound to it than that album, with more screaming from Chester and more rapping from Mike than there has been on either it or Minutes to Midnight. Fans of the softer side the band's demonstrated on theose CDs though shouldn't be too worried, as that's present on here as well.<br /><br />Still, all in all I have mixed feelings about Living Things. Though I like its return to a heavier sound, it still lacks the energy that the band had on their first two albums, and even on certain Minutes to Midnight songs. It exists here in bits and pieces, but even the most scream-heavy track on here (Victimized) doesn't capture it entirely. A lot of the problem I think has to do with the band's continued reliance on electronics, which, much like electro music itself, sounds cool and different to me at first but doesn't keep me coming back to hear it more. Unlike with real instruments, there's no nuance here; nothing to discover on repeat listens, no craftsmanship to admire...nothing to really grab a hold of. Lyrically the songs are all about the same thing for the most part (bad relationships) and many have the same basic structure. As far as the rapping goes...Mike Shinoda has always been simply \\"competent.\\" He certainly doesn't embarrass himself like, say, Fred Durst does, but it's never been fantastic; if you only know rock you may be impressed, but if you listen to a lot of rap music, you'll find much of his rhymes and style to be pretty simplistic. This wasn't too noticeable on the first two Linkin Park CDs when the rapping was integrated so thoroughly into the rock tracks; here, like on A Thousand Suns, the rapping separates itself from the rest of the music and tone of the song, bringing itself far more into the forefront when it does take place, which makes Shinoda's decent-but-unremarkable rhymes more noticeable.<br /><br />All that said, I don't want to give off the impression that this is a bad record. The first 5 songs are all generally pretty good. The 6th, Castle of Glass, is even very good, with some cool lyrics and managing to sound like something truly original. The next one, Victimized, doesn't really go anywhere new but it's great to see a fast and scream-heavy track from this band again. Roads Untraveled has cool background......music, (or whatever that noise is) but it's a little too corny for me, while Skin to Bone is the only track on the album that I can't get into at all; just not a fan.<br /><br />So again, before I continue with this rundown, this is not a bad record; much of it is good, but it also doesn't feel like much more than that; there's not a whole lot to these songs to keep coming back to. The exception to this (besides the aforementioned Castle of Glass) are the last two tracks, where the CD seems to finally truly come to life. Until it Breaks is heavy on the rap but the verses break with a great little vocal from Chester before Shinoda resumes, this time with the music picking up some urgency. He does some cool stuff lyrically here and the song works well, though a slow fadeout (with guitarist Brad Delson providing vocals) kind of kills the momentum despite sounding very cool the first time you hear it. This leads into a short interlude (Tinfoil) before the strong closer, Powerless.<br /><br />So it's difficult to rate Living Things. Besides Skin to Bone, there isn't a bad track on here; there isn't a great one on here either, though 3 do come close. The reliance on electronics and familiar \\"verse-chorus-verse-chorus-end\\" structures and some repetitive lyrics make it tough to keep coming back to many of these songs. Still, it's not a bad listen, and I have to give Linkin Park credit for keeping things unpredictable and for not fading into oblivion like almost all of their fellow Nu Metal bands. Living Things shows in places that the band's still capable of the energy that they used to have, and it does some very cool stuff along the way. I just really think it's time for them to ditch the electronics and try something more musical next time around.
0345803485|1.0|Then there's the writing. If you take out the parts where the female character is blushing or chewing her lips, the book will be down to about 50 pages. Almost on every single page, there is a whole section devoted to her blushing, chewing her lips or wondering \\"Jeez\\" about something or another. Then there's the use of \\"shades of\\". He's \\"fifty shades of @#$%% up,\\" \\"she turned 7 shades of crimson,\\" \\"he's ten shades of x,y, and z.\\" Seriously?  (this is a cut and paste from another review! lol)
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Easy to learn. Plenty of variety. Nice size tiles. Playable over and over again. This is a winner. I can play this while listening to TV or while tired as not much concentration is required.
B003MC5N28|4.0|It is an extraordinarily well crafted novel. The chapters are concise and well structured. Each chapter carries the plot a single distinct step ahead. Though the chapters are untitled, you can easily summarize each one in a succinct sentence. The language is very clear, the plot is interesting and the book reads very quickly. It's a textbook example on how to write good prose. The reason i'm giving it just 4 stars is that, despite its masterful execution, it doesn't really have that gripping a plot or that mesmerizing characters that linger with you after laying the book down. Still, i warmly recommend it.
B000002H48|5.0|I already had this music as an album (LP), but I am very glad to have found it back on cd. Very lovely music of the 70's with this special sound I still love so much.
0143121006|5.0|I normally read 4 or 5 books at a time so I knew this book was a winner when early on I forgot about the other books and read this until I was done.  It is a story that just grabs your interests.  It is much more than just a murder mystery.  It is as much about the time and the place and the events that were going on.  It is a fascinating story about a little known piece of history.  It all would have been lost to history were it not for a bereved father who just would not let it go when everyone else did.  People interested in Chinese history and the prewar period of the late 30's will find this a must read
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I have wanted a Android phone for a while, and thought the HTC would be my best choice. Since getting thru HTC I've noticed that if you don't study on it's on board features you'll find out the battery doesn't last very long. Other than that the phone is nice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never posted a review before but this book (these books if you read them individually) are fabulous.  The characters are engaging, the setting intriguing.  Every word leaves you wanting more.  My favorite thing about them though is the fuzziness of right and wrong.  You know who you are routing for and why but you can also see the good reasons for the other side.  I also love the endless possibilities for the future of this story.  Yes in other books about the existing characters but also the other silos or even a world beyond that.  And I don't just mean in Hugh Howey's books but in your own imagination.  This is the true sign of a great story, when it comes off the page and lives in your mind.<br /><br />Justnora
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. easy to play. easy to go back to kindle fire. I love this movie and the charters. great game, very relaxing for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of my favorite series over the past few years.  There are some minor technical inconsistencies but the overall reading experience is terrific.  I really could not put it down and I'm just dying to know what happens in the subsequent stories.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|I didn't have a big expectations, but this was a great movie.  Even a little fantastical, but I watched it twice!!  It was a great buy for a night at home.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I am a fan of the Beach Boys from day one, and still have the original vinyl. I'm glad they released this album to kick off the golden anniversary of a true Amereican band.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is typical spider solitar,  its easy to use and has pretty good graphics. its a fun game for wasting time and easy to get addicted to!
B003VS0CWO|3.0|I've only watched this blu-ray disc once since buying it yesterday, and just in my first go, I noticed that \\"There's A Light\\" and \\"Rose Tint My World\\" are NOT the versions used on the original movie.  There could be more but those are the two that stuck out like sore thumbs to me.  Someone apparently decided that this new master made from the original negatives would be better off somehow with different takes of songs, but I'm failing to see the logic here.  Since the most popular reviews fail to mention this major flaw, maybe I'm the weird one for thinking that any tampering of a soundtrack that arguably defines an entire movie is a very, very bad idea.  This release could have had five stars easily.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got Temple Run as soon as I found out it was on Kindle Fire. I absolutely love it! It's completely addicting! Definitely recommend it for hours of fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg y'all are really saying this game is not fun give it some time insted of not trying my high score is 216,476.<br />maybe if u try u can get that score too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Quite the interesting book. Makes me wanta write my own! Keep up the good work! Makes life a bit more interesting! God help us if the men read it & get ideas!
0525478817|5.0|THE FAULT IN OUR STARS broke my heart and pieced it back together again. I'm a huge John Green fan, and his books are part of my reading happy place. I love the way he weaves words together, his wry humor, his too-smart-for-their-own-good characters. I sit down to read his books knowing most of what to expect (in a good way), but he usually ends up surprising me on a few points.<br /><br />I loved TFIOS. From the start, I was rooting for jaded, frustrated Hazel. Like her, I fell for Gus, and I quickly became immersed in their story, in their lives, as they struggled with the crappy hand they'd been dealt.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, I cracked. Nothing particularly bad was happening in the story at that moment, but the general awesome-teens-with-awful-cancer thing got to me, and tears began tracking their way down my cheeks. I had become invested in Hazel and Gus and wanted for them the perfect happy ending that they deserved, but I knew they wouldn't get it. That thought basically made me cry--quietly and steadily--through to the end of the book.<br /><br />There was no climactic, melodramatic ending (like, no one dies tragically in a mudslide in South America (*cough* NicholasSparks *cough*)), but it fit the book and the characters, which is just about all a reader can ask for.<br /><br />And that's why I love John Green's writing. If you're a fan of [[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]] (and if you're not, seriously, GO READ LOOKING FOR ALASKA), then TFIOS will be your new favorite book.<br /><br />This review was originally posted at [...]
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My son loves this. Of all the things I have for his bassinet, this is his favorite. He loves to kick the things hanging down and grabs at the red ring all the time. He enjoys seeing himself in the mirror when I point it at him.
0439023491|5.0|If it is even possible, a step up from the Hunger Games. I couldnt put this book down! Ahhh I wish there were more than 3 books!
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book and was so glad I was able to buy it at a discounted price.  It arrived in time and in great shape.
B0055MI8K2|2.0|But not the good kind. I cannot believe how much pain that the shock pads can cause. I hosed off my old Tevas, and plan to donate these to Goodwill; although I feel guilty about what I'm doing to some poor \\"sole\\".  Seriously, Teva, you are going to lose loyal customers if you cripple them.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|the series is excellent but the package I paid 70 $ for is a ptece of junk, If you buy this item cneck it our at once for defects At first I thought it was only the first disk then 2 nd  the second more junk WIL NOT PLAY Perhaps defective in manufacture . Suggest you investigate item at omce if you buy ftom this compamy, They did offer to replace first disk but the whole DVD seies is flawed BE careful !!
1475143389|5.0|I just finished this book and it's exactly what I was looking for.  Like other reviewers, I have been working out for a while on my own but wanted more structure around my workouts and nutrition program.  This book gave me everything I was looking for but was also a quick and entertaining read.  In addition to the book, you will get access to a helpful guide to first year and the author actively reaches out to you individually to see if you have any questions.  All in all a great deal for $8!  I am looking forward to getting started with the program.
B007SGM084|1.0|I have been hearing so much about these books, that I decided to purchase it on my Kindle. I truly wish I would have done a little more research on the subject of these books. I will never read it, will erase it from my Kindle library and will have learned a costly lesson.
B007OXWWX4|5.0|If you want pure rock n roll with the most amazing guitar you must have it, if you are waiting the eternal guns n roses sound just undust your old cd´s.... this record its awesome, full of energy and excellent music, all the instruments sounds amazing and the vocals so great !!!!!! i love this record !!!!!!
159102594X|4.0|Logen Ninefingers is the most feared man in the North. He's killed more men than the plague. The Bloody-Nine is a name to instill fear in the hearts of the strongest of men, a name mothers use to scare their children. But what if it didn't have to be so?<br /><br />Jezal dan Luthar is the son of a wealthy nobleman. A handsome, arrogant, young man whose life consists of playing cards and getting drunk, in between training for the Contest, a popular fencing competition that has set many a noble on the path to high station.<br /><br />Sand dan Glokta is an officer for the His Majesty's Inquisition, a once famous Colonel in the army headed for greatness. Until he was captured in war, tortured, returning two years later to his homeland, a crippled, broken and bitter shell of his former self. Now he tortures others in the name of his King, all the while wondering why he does it.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is the debut novel and the first book in Abercrombie's trilogy, The First Law. This isn't your typical Fantasy. Gritty and bloody with dark humor, Abercrombie weaves a story that has you hooked an wanting for more. The primary characters are all interesting in their own way - Logen the feared killer, inwardly a surprisingly philosophical and practical man who really wants to separate himself from his violent past; Jezal the spoilt brat, with enough talent and wealth to accomplish great things, but seems to lack the desire; and Glokta, the fallen hero turned Inquisitor, whose daily life is one of agony and self-loathing.<br /><br />Then there is Bayaz, the legendary and mysterious First of the Magi, who has surprisingly returned to the Union after centuries of self-imposed exile to help shape the path for the looming war with the Gurkish Emperor and his invading army. But is his path really the right path?<br /><br />Meanwhile, the North has amassed an army under their self-proclaimed King and are eager for conquest. Is the Union, preoccupied with the familiar threat ofthe Gurkish, ignoring a more immediate and pressing danger?<br /><br />It's hard to say too much without giving things away, but suffice to say this novel is a must-read for any fan of modern Fantasy. Each of Abercrombie's novels are excellent, but this being the first, not surprisingly has some issues with pacing. But it only gets better as it goes along, and by the end he has you hooked. He continues his growth as a writer with his later books, as his prose and style come into their own. But more on that later.<br /><br />I would easily give this book a 9 out of 10 (since I can't award half stars, it has been rounded down here to a four). An excellent debut, and the start of what has so far been a pretty terrific writing career.
B000VS20M2|4.0|I won't rehash everything that has been said about this movie. It's just great! My only nitpick on this particular product/version of it is that Amazon's product description is only half correct. The movie is Region ALL, BUT the second disc (which I was looking forward to seeing is region 2! So, be forwarned and Amazon, please update this information into the product description.[[ASIN:B000VS20M2 Blade Runner the F [Blu-ray]
B004EBT5CU|4.0|the CD was great.  it came quickly as promised.  the only thing strange about it, is that the information encoded on it is for the wrong cd.  instead, the information came out for a snow patrol album.  makes it kinda hard when it's in my digital music player. so i don't have any of the correct song names or artist digitally.  but the music itself is superb.  adele is incredibly talented and her songs really showcase the power of her voice.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best puzzle game I have downloaded so far.  in fact liked it so much the whole family downloaded to their kindle. I have had no problems playing this and graphics are terriffic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire and it is know one of my favorite games you should get it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun bunch of games, some are pretty addicting.  there are some odd games in the pack, not sure how sudoku fits in there, but most are goodntime killers
B007IXWKUK|5.0|For all the hype that this series received, it was not just about sex. It is about how a relationship grows and blossoms. After reading the first book, I thought should I read the second? I am glad I decided to read book 2 and now I cant wait to start reading book 3
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|The regular DVD is fine, no problems.  However on the Blu-Ray Disc about 30 minutes into the movie the words and the actors mouth do not come togehter.  You can see the mouths move after the voices have stopped.  Same problem I had with the first set that I bought.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Apple Itunes has this band listed under alternative, but it's definitely not.  Its rock, along the lines of Bruce Springsteen with that great Jersy sound.  I recommend buying every album.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Good tight harmonies. Good to see new material from my favorite group. A must have for Beach Boy Fans.A very good buy at thia price.
B005EVE8WG|5.0|This is Album is incredible!  It has the sound of Journey with a modern kick.  The vocals are amazingly smooth and powerful.  The music rocks.  Work Of Art is definitely worth a listen!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|read reviews and will see how it plays.  took some time to iron out bugs with ice age village hopefully it will take less time with this app
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I have an acuatic camera (Coleman 5MP) with several accesories, everything fits perfectly, excellent size, with shoulder strap, includes a cushion divider, highly recommended for any point and shot camera.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun and enjoyable!  Nice user interface and very fluid. My only concern is that sometimes it will not Completely recognize your touch,  but it does not affect gameplay
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game and Scrat is cool too!  Will and have recommended to all my friends.  Looking forward to more.
0451196716|5.0|I read this one in college and decided to pick it up again. I'm very glad I did as it had the same impact I remember from my first read. King is unquestionably the King of the macabre. If you haven't read this one, do so. You won't be disappointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a great waste of time and is very addictive. even when people say it is boring it is great and fun to unlock new iteams and people. itvis great for kids and terns of this generation. (:
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I love my kindle and have found that many of my family members do too.  More than once I've found one of our kids using it to read or play games.  It has taken a few tumbles and I credit the hard case cover for keeping it safe.  I do wish I'd gotten a different color, white shows everything and it often looks like many hands have held it.  Because they have.  But it does clean up easily.
B004E9SU14|4.0|On this album, you'll find simple, catchy alternative British rock songs. That's really all there is to it. If you are a fan of the Arctic Monkeys, Oasis, or Spoon, you will most likely enjoy this. There isn't much else to say, so I'll recommend my favorite songs from it.<br />\\"Rearrange\\" \\"Come Closer\\" \\"Take This Night From Me\\"<br />Come to think of it, you shouldn't even be reading these reviews...go listen to the damn songs on YouTube and decide for yourself
0307592731|5.0|I've had a hard time starting another book because I can't let go of this one!  It's like losing a friend, the best kind of read.  I admire Cheryl's ability to share some possibly embarrassing feelings and experiences, her openness being part of the charm of the book. I loved her writing style.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this first book of the trilogy. It was so exhilarating and tantalizing. There were several times I had to put the book down, unless I was willing to become an exhibitionist. I think my future mightl have a \\"red room of pain\\"!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a pinnacle in buzz marketing.  Why I read this book is still a wonder to me.  I guess it was pure curiosity and power of the buzz that drove me to press the button.  What I found was a fairly simple episode of Sex in the City.  Yes, it's risqué for a Best Seller list but in the end we judge it by poor editing, simple writing, and oh ya, the cover.  I'm fascinated by the thought of a trilogy....
