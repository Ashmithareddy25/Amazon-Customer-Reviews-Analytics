B000AMJDHY|5.0|This CD has blown me away with it's high energy songs, which consist of clever melodies mixed with almost techno beats. It is as good as Fall Out Boy's Cork Tree CD (which I also love). The lead singer's voice is not monotonous or annoying as with so many bands in this genre.  Instead, he manages to conveys strong emotions without unintelligible screaming.
0670033375|3.0|Jared Diamond's previous book, Guns, Germs, and Steel was so fascinating that I told everyone I know, and even some complete strangers, about it. I re-read it and found it just as interesting. Not a long book, but it is so packed with ideas that I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I was looking forward to the follow-up book from Diamond.<br /><br />I plowed right into Collapse, even though it started with the less-than-inspiring topic of mining in Montana. I know mining is an important topic, but just the mention of mining or fisheries or rain forests is enough to send me into a stupor. After slogging through a few hundred pages, I finally tossed the book aside.<br /><br />Then I unexpectedly found myself mulling over bits of the book and decided I had to go back and give it another try. I got further into it this time, but other books caught my attention and Collapse sank to the bottom of my book pile and stayed there.<br /><br />Collapse has its interesting parts: the mysterious Easter Island statues and how such a remote island came to be inhabited at all; the Maya civilization and how archaeologists and others have pieced together its language and history; Diamond's thesis that most collapses of societies have had ecological causes.<br /><br />But there's an awful lot of unnecessary detail, statistics, and repetition here, and unless you're a fan of those things (as well as long discussions of mining, fisheries, and rain forests), you might find that some judicious skimming will help you get through Collapse. Or you could just go read Guns, Germs, and Steel again.
0345457684|5.0|It's the future and it's shaped by a revolutionary innovation: digitization of the human cortex. At birth, a cortical stack that assumes the function of the human cortex is implanted the brain and it stores all experiences digitally. Nobody dies, at least not unless they experience Real Death, the (often homicidal) equivalent of the organic passing away. Cortical stacks are re-implanted (\\"sleeved\\") into dormant bodies (of criminals whose stacks are in long-term storage), synthetic bodies, or clones (for those who can afford them) to enable continuation of life, light speed travel or rapid aggrandizement of troops on a remote star system. A special class of troops, the Envoy, are trained to psychopathic proportions to excel in this new reality; they can swap bodies like gloves, absorb cultures like sponges, wage war with or without weapons, and manipulate people like puppet masters. Altered Carbon is the story of a renegade Envoy known as \\"Kovacs\\", who is forcefully sleeved on Earth and plunged into a complex murder mystery involving some very long-lived, powerful, god-like people.<br /><br />This book is so thoroughly enjoyable that have to tear yourself off of it when you need to sleep. The plot is flawless, the texture is thick and while Morgan does not invent very many new concepts, he masterfully constrains existing ones into believability. The writing is excellent. Morgan makes you chuckle and at times laugh out loud. Literary devices like Kovacs' hallucinated conversations with his dead friend and occasional citations of remembered lessons of Envoy philosophy add color and depth to the narrative. There are no paragraphs that don't goad you onto the next one. All in all, this is great science fiction - riotously fun and thought provoking at the same time.
B000002L68|5.0|I normally review things that a bit obscure, if not totally unexpected, so this is like claiming that I can also appreciate what is in the mainstream.  Just a few months ago, I found the DVD of the movie in a library in Kansas while I was visiting my mother, and it seemed like a great pick for seeing how well the computer she has now could play a DVD.  I know enough about art to know how movies lie, and it finally dawned on me that `Computer Blue' was the song written by Lisa and Wendy, but for plot reasons, the movie pretended that `Purple Rain' was their song so everyone would want Prince to do `Purple Rain' to prove that he did not just dig himself.  I saw Prince playing the chords on the piano in the movie, and instead of him trying to learn it, he seemed like he already had it nailed.  After listening to this album for years, `Purple Rain' is the song that shows Prince at the top of his form, and the idea that he stole the basic musical structure of the song from a couple girls in the band is almost laughable.  Don't you people know when a movie is pulling your leg?
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Seriously, this needs to stop. Sheena Easton had more success with her 'No Strings' album than Rod has in four discs of attempts at this. Pathetic.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Am I the only one that cringes with the Hallmark-like lyrics of this album? The music is derivitive and over-produced. They channeled U2 in a subtle, non-wearing-your-influence-on-your-sleave way. Now they've just gone overboard.  <br /> <br />This is why artists die when they become happily married. Especially those who base their work on the subject of love. Misery writes the best music.  <br /> <br />They are on a slippery slope downhill.
B000000SDB|5.0|Overall, I'd highly recommend Harnoncourt's cycle.  <br /> <br />First, a little about the overall character: The symphonies are performed on a mid-sized orchestra using modern instruments (except for the horns), but with certain period performing practices. For example, there is noticably less vibrato than normal, and tempos tend to be a bit brisker than most modern instrument performances. Harnoncourt has a very individual approach, and every symphony has at least one or two surprises. Finally, for those who find it important (like me), all repeats are included. <br /> <br />Now, for the individual symphonies: <br /> <br />1, 2, & 4: I don't have vast knowledge of what these three symphonies sound like on other disks, but I think they sound great here, and are all my #1 versions. <br /> <br />3: The first two movements are taken on the fast side, and aside from some obscured detail in one part of the first movement, come off very well. In the first movement, the horns at the very end of the development blare so triumphantly it literally startled me the first couple of times. The last movements are pretty much standard, and also very good. My favorite so far. <br /> <br />5: An excellent version. I've never heard the oboe solo in the first movement sound as emotionally powerful as it does here. This version and Kleiber's are my favorites. <br /> <br />6: This is the most complained-about part of this set. I actually have no objections to this version, though I haven't heard any of the versions frequently cited as the best. <br /> <br />7: Kleiber's version is just plain better in my opinion. In Harnoncourt's last movement, the main theme tends to get buried under the \\"rhythm section,\\" and the other movements don't surpass Kleiber in any way I could hear. It's still a good version, though. <br /> <br />8: Both have different virtues, but I think I prefer Karajan '62 over Harnoncourt's. I haven't heard a perfect version of the eighth yet. <br /> <br />9: Solely in terms of conducting decisions, this is my prototype for a perfect Ninth. In the second movement, I love Harnoncourt's recklessly fast acceleration into the trio, and the last half of the fourth movement is superb. This part always dragged in other versions I'd heard, but here the last ten minutes are totally exhillarating. However, the size of the orchestra and quality of the solo singers keep this from being a perfect recording. Turning up the volume almost negates the size issue, but there's no ignoring that up until the turkish march, I've heard much better singing. Still, this is the version I usually listen to nowadays. <br /> <br />To summarize, I think this is an excellent (albeit expensive) set. It contains the only versions of 1-4 I currently listen to, my top versions of 5 & 9, and good versions of the remaining symphonies.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Just a fun movie from start to finish.  This time the gossip mags didn't lie.  The chemistry between John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) is real and practically jumps off the screen.  From the beginning when we meet them in the therapist's office to the movie's climax (no pun intended) you just root for them.  The action is great but the comedy is better.  Biggest surprise?  Angelina Jolie is hysterical.  Who knew that she could do comedy?  She can do more with a look than most actors can do with 10 pages of dialogue.  Yes, the action sequences are over-the-top but the movie never tries to take itself seriously.  Sit back and enjoy the eye candy, the humor, and the action.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It is so hard not to see where Joss Whedon might have gone if he'd had an entire season to develop his story in instead of just 2 hours.  Firefly/Serenity is a must see for all Sci Fi fans.  It has everything, intellegent characters, humor, insite, whores, Chinese.... a fan cannot help of hope there Serenity 2, 3 and 4 will follow the DVD release.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Here where i live (Argentina) is almost imposible that a band like this could tour. Even if they get together again on a world tour !!!. But to have this concert on a DVD is almost like that. Imagine yourself in Earls Court, on Oct 1994, play the DVD, put it loud in your HI FI system and fly !!!. To see the full performance of Dark Side of the Moon, the guitar solo on Comfortably numb and the \\"parafernalia\\" of ligths and sound worths it !!! <br />So, if u r a new fan of the band, or not even a fan, buy it, watch it, hear it and then tell me !!!. <br />If u dont't like it, i'll pay you the price !!!

0553801503|5.0|You have to read this book twice.   <br /> <br />I pre-ordered from the UK to get the book early, rushed through it and was disappointed. <br /> <br />Then I read it again, more carefully.  And it all became clear. <br /> <br />This book has *major* character development and *major* (but subtle) plot movements.  I won't post spoilers here, but I'd just caution everyone to read slowly and with care.   <br /> <br />And let's not consider comparisons with Robert Jordan unlike Jordan's doorstops, Feast of Crows moves every character forward and puts them in position for Dance with Dragons.  All you one star reviewers really need to give this one a second read (one of them had a factual error in his review concerning the Dornish). <br />
0307276902|5.0|This is a very good book, and I'm glad Oprah's club picked it. I know Oprah. everyone loves her, she's great. James story is one of thousands persons with this problem but it does provide a detailed picture of what drives somebody to an addiction and the road back. I was amazed by the courage of the writer, and his strength in sticking to his gut feelings in a recovery world. This book teaches about many things, control, addiction, love, strength, and much more. <br />   This is a must read book for anyone who knows someone with an addiction or who is an addict or a recovering addict themselves. I did  like it because it did  meet my expectations.  <br />Must also recommend the book Sex and the perfect lover by Mabel Iam is gripping in the reality of pain and suffering and how to try to overcome it, when you have addiction to sex and relationships. It is great if you've been through this addiction and recovery or extremely close to someone that has.  <br /> <br />Remember: addiction is that most destructive force that is both an emptiness, <br />
0553573403|5.0|I started reading this book because someone told me it is as good as any of Tolkien's works. After reading it my favourite author is... Martin. Yip, it is that good.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is its extraordinary characters. You get the really good ones and the really bad ones all and they are all equally likable. Another good thing (for me) is that Martin is not afraid to kill one of his main characters. He has the ability to replace that person with one just as stunning. Unlike in a lot of other fantasy stories, important people do actually die.<br /><br />As far as magic is concerned, there is just little enough of it to be accepted. There are no mighty and powerful wizards and yet, there's still the mysterious element in the story. Just the way I like it.<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning is the clever plot. Great stuff, I have to congratulate Martin on this. Just when you think you have it, the plot wriggles free and something totally unforseen happens!<br /><br />Just one more thing, some people might find this book a bit too voilent. I think it's just realistic. My final vote - READ IT!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Finally, System puts out a quality cd.  I have been a fan since their first material came out, and they seem to be getting better and better.  This cd is maybe a little more melodic than their previous efforts, but they still get crazy on a few tracks.  All the stanzas blend together well and the short length of the cd makes you put it on repeat.  I don't find the guitarist's extra singing all that appealing, but the irony of that is the best track on the cd, \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", features his vocals.  The melodies and vocal harmonies are smooth and its always interesting to disect the lyrics to figure out what they're trying to say.  Hopefully this band will stick around for a long time to come, because they are getting better with age.

B00097DXZS|4.0|Ok, so it has copy right protection or whatever.  Get over it.  Can't you just buy a CD every once in a while?  I think most of the songs are good.  He throws in a few with his band which sounds like typical Santana.  I like most of the collaborations.  I'm not saying it's Supernatural.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  There are a lot of styles on the record.  Plus Carlos layers his guitar virtuoso over each track.  I found the record fairly easy to listen to.  All in all, it's not a bad buy.  I'm glad I purchased it.
0553579908|5.0|I am pleased to say that Martin did not let me down. Clash of Kings is just as binding and brilliant as the first book. <br /> <br />One thing that did change though, in this book the whole magical element started to increase. Not that that's a bad thing. It's exciting, gives a fresh twist to the story and it holds a promise of more to come in the next book. I can't wait. As soon as I'm done with my exams I will finally get to read the next one.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I love Santana, but I am not buying this CD because it installs the most insideous form  of virus/trojan-horse called a root kit onto your PC if you rip/play it there.  The rootkit isn't even well written at that, so it is even more dangerous to your pc. <br /> <br />Also,  There is NO WAY TO REMOVE IT without completely reinstalling your Windows Operating system! <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  I use Yahoo/musicmatch/napster and am comfortable with their Digital Rights Management. <br /> <br />Tell SONY you won't stand for this and do not buy this CD
B00004STUL|5.0|Great casting, good dialogue, exceptional cinematography are tied up in a tight little bundle, the best cop \\"buddy\\" movie I've ever seen. It's not for kids, way too violent, but it's excellent adult entertainment. Will Smith is ultra-suave, Martin Lawrence provides the human side of the pair, and the disposable chick lead actually does rather well in her role.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of cop movies or violent crime dramas, but I've got this on DVD and I watch it at least once a year. It's an unusually well-produced film for what it is.
B000002GYW|5.0|I have, oh, I dunno.  Maybe 550 LP records, some 200 casettes, and probably a like number of CD's.  Of all of them, this record has been played more than any of them.  In the early 70's I listened to it constantly.  The concept, \\"modern rock and rollers as old west outlaws\\", was easily segued, by me, into my own life as a military elite. <br /> <br />The story of Bill Doolin and Bill Dalton was familiar to me.  Seems that 3 Dalton brothers, Grat, Bob, and Emmitt, along with two others, tried to rob two banks at once in Coffeyville, Kansas.  The attempt went horribly wrong, and 4 townspeople and 4 outlaws were killed, including Bob and Grat.  Emmitt survived about 20 some wounds to live well into the 20th Century.  Bill Dalton, another brother, then joined up with a gang member that didn't make the trip, Bill Doolin. The resulting Doolin-Dalton gang ran through the territory in a manner the original gang never imagined.  It included members named Dynamite Dick, Tulsa Jack, Arkansas Tom, and a fellow named Bitter Creek Newcombe. <br /> <br />The Eagles used all this as an allegory to describe the life of a modern rock and roll star.  Loneliness, uncertainty, fear, the road, wild times and hangovers, sudden death, love that is all too short.  The feeling of being outside the mainstream.  I loved it. <br /> <br />From the opening strains of \\"Doolin-Dalton\\", to the quiet, desperate \\"Saturday Night\\", the raucous full speed ahead of \\"Out of Control\\" followed by the painful \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", the Album explores all that.  But the best song is the classic, \\"Desperado\\".  It asks, is it all worth it, all this fast living on the edge, without love? <br /> <br />Bernie Leadon, Don Henley, Glen Frey and Randy Meisner are all good players, singers, and songwriters.  This band does not have the virtuoso feel of the Joe Walsh/Don Felder bands on guitar, just good, solid country picking.  Great singing on every song.  A quiet, heartfelt classic, that really really speaks to me today,after all these years.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey's `A MILLION LITTLE PIECES' is everything that it has been describe to be and more.  It is captivating, riveting and heart-wrenching it is also eye opening and extremely hard hitting, the kind of book that stays with you for a very long, long time after your done.  Frey does not hold back any punches when it comes to describing the horrors he and others around him endured while on drugs and trying to stay clean.  Most of Frey's accounts of his six weeks in rehab were unimaginable to me as someone who does not drink and has never done a drug but his story still touched me...and scared me. It scared me because he made it clear that this could happen to anyone, we always hear this and we think that we know it but after reading a true story that to the average person probably seems so far from thier reality this point really hit home. James was there with everyone from your run of the mill crackhead to family men and superior court judges and alcoholism and addiction are not pretty for anyone.<br /><br />The first few chapters of the book hooked me and kept me up reading very late into the night. I was rapidly turning the pages as Frey told of those first few days and his struggle to stay in rehab while his body was so near death. Yet I was reading as if I were watching a horror movie, practically with my hands covering my eyes leaving just enough space between my fingers to peek through and see what happens next.  I followed James's struggle throughout the rest of the book with hopes for his future and rooting for him every step of the way, until he made a twenty-two page list of all of his past wrongs and the horrible, horrible things that he'd done in his short 23 years and I began to wonder if I would in reality root this hard for someone who had hurt so many people so dearly.  In the end my answer was yes, not only because this book will probably help as many and certainly more people than he hurt but also because he was able to get a second chance which as you can see from the absolutely sobering and heartbreaking epilogue doesn't happen for most people in his situation.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone and especially to anyone who has ever done drugs, knows someone who has done drugs, is thinking about doing drugs or has children and young people they care about in their lives.  This will definitely be required reading for my children in the future.u can see from the absolutely sobering and heartbreaking epilogue doesn't happen for most people in his situation.

0679422714|1.0|[...]    Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday is not historical scholarship but hysterical rant. The purpose of this work is to demonize Mao Zedong and destroy his reputation, pure and simple. The master narrative is that Mao was evil from the day he was born-and committed evil upon evil until the day he died. Chang and Halliday reconstruct and fabricate history to make the case that a scheming and bloodthirsty opportunist hijacked an entire people and country.    Reader beware. You are being lied to. Mao: The Unknown Story plays fast and loose with facts, offers far-fetched theories based not on careful investigation but unrelenting hatred of Mao, and twists reality to fit an anticommunist agenda. The message is that the Chinese revolution was not really necessary, and that great revolutionary leaders like Mao are in fact power-crazed tyrants and perpetrators of towering crimes. This book is a brief against revolution and revolutionary leaders. If you swallowed the justifying arguments about \\"weapons of mass destruction,\\" you'll adore this book.  Mao: The Unknown Story employs a methodology that distorts reality:    1) Was a revolution needed?  The authors paint a picture of a revolution based on manipulation and terror. They whitewash the incredible misery and suffering of the old society, and the fact that for more than a century China had been beaten down and dominated by the imperialist powers of the West and Japan. They deny that tens and hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants and workers could possibly take up the revolutionary cause as their own. The masses of people have no agency in the company of Chang and Halliday-they are but pawns and putty.     You would not learn from this book that pre-revolutionary China was a society where arranged marriages and footbinding were widespread social practices. Or that 4 million people died each year of infectious and parasitic diseases. Or that in a city like Shanghai, young women workers were locked in textile factories at night, and one out of five persons was an opium addict. You wouldn't know that the revolution in power rapidly transformed these social conditions. The Marriage Law of 1950, one of the first decrees of the new People's Republic, established marriage by mutual consent, right to divorce, and outlawed the sale of children, and infanticide.      2) Mao as revolutionary theorist and revolutionary leader  It borders on the absurd. The authors are consumed with such venom for Mao that they cannot-in all 630 pages of text-bring themselves to treat Mao's writings and speeches about the revolutionary process before and after the seizure of power. In the sordid psychohistory of Chang and Halliday, Mao's ideas are simply hypocritical and manipulative means to attain personal domination. In fact, Mao analyzed the nature of Chinese society and developed programs and policies that spoke to the real material and social contradictions of Chinese society; and Mao brought forth a vision of moving society beyond exploitation and social divisions. All this inspired and motivated great numbers of people in China and around the world. This is what our authors find so reprehensible.     3) Shoddy methods and sensationalistic claims  The authors bask in the glow of a vast arsenal of references and sources-memoirs, hitherto inaccessible archives, interviews-and ten years of research. Boasting more than 125 pages of notes and sources...what the book says must be true-right? No, this is a snow job, and the relationship between claim and supporting evidence is shoddy beyond belief.    Let's take three egregious examples:    *The famous battle at the Dadu River Bridge during the Long March is now declared (pp. 152-55) to be a hoax, a self-serving myth invented by Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. The authors claim that \\"there was no battle\\" and \\"no Nationalist [Kuomintang] troops at the bridge.\\" They cite as a substantiating source the Kuomintang (KMT) archives. TheKMT, which set world standards in corruption, and which suffered defeat at the hands of the Communist Party-led forces, is not exactly the most reliable source. Still, these archives contain useful historiographic materials-but, lo and behold, other scholars who have studied the KMT archives say they do not at all support the Chang/Halliday rewrite of history. Okay, but the authors furnish what they consider to be additional evidence, and key to this are the recollections of a \\"sprightly 93-year old\\" local woman they say they met in 1997! This quality of scholarship would be laughable in any other discipline. But somehow you can get away with this when it comes to Mao and the Chinese Revolution.    *Listen to this gem about Mao's view on education (p. 438): \\"Mao's approach was not to raise the general standard of education in society as a whole, but to focus on a small elite, predominantly in science and other `useful' subjects, and leave the rest of the population to be illiterate or semi-literate slave laborers.\\" If that were the case, how can you explain the fact that China's literacy rate vaulted from 15 percent in 1949 to close to 80 percent by Mao's death? Or that educational resources were vastly expanded in the rural areas during the Cultural Revolution, leading to rise in middle-school enrollment from 15 to 58 million? Or that with the huge opening up of educational opportunities through the Cultural Revolution, worker and peasant students became the great majority of China's university enrollment by the early 1970s.    *Or take this claim about the Cultural Revolution: \\"There was not one school in the whole of China where atrocities did not occur\\" (p. 518). Surely, we would expect to find ample documentation for such a sweeping statement of fact. But you will search in vain for a single source. The method is clear. Repeat the slander often enough...and it becomes fact.    4) The Chinese Revolution on the scales of history  The Chinese revolution was a turning point in the history of the 20th century. As Mao said in 1949, \\"the Chinese people have stood up.\\" They stood up to feudal landlords, the Japanese invaders, the U.S.-financed KMT army, and foreign powers. Despite the authors' outrageous claims, it was Mao who led in developing a military strategy to surround the cities from the countryside. He led in the development of a socialist society marked by the creative energy and initiative of those who had previously been treated as no more than a pair of hands.    This was a revolution that brought enormous social and economic progress to the great of majority of people. Life expectancy more than doubled, from 32 years in 1949 to 65 years in 1975. China under Mao achieved what the U.S. has proven incapable of coming close to: a universal and egalitarian health care system. Industry grew by more than 10 percent a year during the Cultural Revolution. And by the early 1970s, China had solved its historic food problem. This revolution saved untold numbers of lives.     The Cultural Revolution, far from being Mao's \\"Great Purge,\\" was a \\"revolution within the revolution.\\" It was a broad movement and upheaval aimed at preventing a new privileged class from taking power and turning China into what it has become since Mao died in 1976: a sweatshop paradise riddled with corruption and inequality. China is no longer socialist.       5) What's at stake in the debate over this book?  Basically two things. First, the truth of Mao and the Chinese revolution-what this revolution was about, what Mao stood for and did, and what the Chinese people accomplished. Second, the question of humanity's future: can we put an end to the horrific exploitation, oppression, and inequality of the world as it is, and radically transform it-or is this the only world possible? Mao: The Unknown Story is character assassination with a reactionary moral writ large: dreams of radical and revolutionary change are doomed; long live the status quo.
0156027321|4.0|I finished reading this book for my book club and had to comment on a few things about it. <br />First off, the praise...what a great story. I couldn't stop reading this book. Late nights, lunch breaks at work, any 5 minutes when I had nothing else to do was spent on the boat with Pi and Richard Parker. <br /> <br />I have to take some exception to the author's assertion that reading his story will make you believe in God. Correct me if I'm wrong here...but this is fiction! How does a fictional story, however miraculous the protagonist's triumph, inspire belief? I find this as likely as somebody watching E.T. and believing in aliens as a result. (and as a side note, I think God himself told this story once...it was called \\"Daniel in the Lion's Den\\" and Christians believe it to be non-fiction). <br /> <br />Make no mistake, the book was excellent and well written.  The handling of Pi's spiritual development and devotion is well done. Pi embraces three religions with a childlike innocence that is very credible, and his defense of maintaining a stake in all three beliefs is extremely mature and well handled. Still I don't think missionaries have replaced their copies of the Gospel they hand out with copies of \\"Life of Pi.\\"
B000BGR0OM|5.0|It's been 24 years since the Eurythmics released their first album, In The Garden, and twenty-five years since Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart first formed the group in London. Over the years and eight studio albums later, the duo racked up two dozen hit singles around the world. On the newly released Ultimate Collection, we are treated to seventeen of their most popular tracks, as well as two brand new tracks recorded this past August after the duo reunited for \\"Live 8\\" in July. The new tracks bookend the collection with \\"I've Got A Life\\" opening the CD and \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\" closing the set. Dave Stewart comments on the new recordings (their first in five years), \\"Annie and I didn't plan to go into the studio, she was staying with me in Los Angeles and we seemed to spontaneously write and record some songs. It was just like the old days, songs coming at lightning speed and recorded and mixed in a week! I think they are Eurythmics classics.\\" In between the two new \\"classics\\" are their most beloved songs in chronological order, beginning with \\"Love Is A Stranger,\\" and the song that woke America up to this new synth pop band with Lennox's unique vocals and Stewart's innovative production and musicianship, \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This.)\\" Other hits that follow include \\"Who's That Girl?,\\" \\"Here Comes The Rain Again,\\" \\"Would I Lie To You?,\\" along with one of the greatest women's anthems \\"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves,\\" with Annie and Aretha trading secrets while their vocals exploded out of your speakers. The raucous \\"Missionary Man\\" is followed by the splendiferous \\"You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart,\\" the raw sexual rebel yell of \\"I Need A Man,\\" \\"I Saved The World Today\\" and their last recording from a full release, 1999's \\"17 Again.\\" If I missed your favorite \\"ultimate hit,\\" chances are it's in this outstanding collection. Hey, would I lie to you?
B000001GF9|5.0|Leonard Bernstein had a remarkable gift for conducting sacred music.  His coordination of the soloists, the chorus and the orchestra is superb.  The performance by Arleen Auger is magnificent, indeed one might call it inspired.  This recording is the one most often played in our household and all are unanimous in regarding it as the best ever.  The editorial review presented above is very much on target.  And of course one must pay homage to the composer for his conception of such a masterpiece.

I have had a schoolgirl crush on Brendan Perry's rich, silky voice for many, many years (I think I was a schoolgirl before Mr. Perry was born!) He definately borrows his stylings from the crooners of yesteryear, which adds a sense of urbane class to his simple, lovely compositions.  <br /> <br />This new CD is lush and lovely, but it suffers a little from the overuse of the reverb. Perry's voice is strong enough to stand on it's own, and the recording sounds as if it were made in an echo chamber. I have heard this effect used with much success to hide the sins of lesser voices, and it just isn't needed here. Because of this, my old ears have a hard time making out the lyrics.
0553801503|5.0|The fourth installment in A Song of Fire and Ice will be remembered for being vital in developing the depth of the story.  It allows Martin to take the coming spectacle to new heights.   <br /> <br />Overwhelming grit, astoundingly vivid colors, and sometimes a stench so strong it is almost real, no author hits it like Martin.  <br /> <br />Many holes are filled, while tantalizing clues tease the reader like bait tossed in.  For instance, that island monk knew a little too much about the supposedly dead character Dog.    <br /> <br />This is not more of the usual pulp, where the hero never dies.  When there is as much action as Martin writes, we need a steady flow of fresh blood. <br /> <br />Yes, I missed Tyrion and would not have minded a few more battles, but there will certainly be plenty of that coming up.  Hopefully, that Bolton clan will get their due in the next installment. <br /> <br />The characters grow or die, the stage set.  Dragons don't grow overnight.   <br />
0553801503|1.0|First things first: <br /> <br />I don't know about ROY. Don't look to me for him. But he must be some damn good audio speaker for so many people to cry over him. Tempts me to buy this audio books to see for myself what this fuss is all about... <br /> <br />Now to the main dish: <br /> <br />Feast for Crows sucked big time. I will tell you why: It is only half a novel. It is ironically what Martin sought to avoid...he wanted to tell the STORY of half the characters in Feast and not half the story for all his characters. Well, how to put it...he failed very much in that. I loved Martin's works because he was a very good handler of structure and FEAST is sorely missing in this regard. It begins very slowly, describes too many details, has very few meaningful scenes and ends in cliffhangers. The characters are very dull and uninteresting (particularly these in Dorne and Samwell Tarly). Brienne would have made an okay character but Martin failed in giving her a proper story. She just rides aimlessly in the Riverlands, kills some Bloody Mummers and manages to get herself hanged at \\"Stoneheart`s\\" Orders. In the latter she at last had to make a choice in a personal dilemma and that was very good character wise, but it occured very late at the very end of her plot. We don't know what happend with Brienne...we will find out somewhere in... <br /> <br />...Dance of Dragons? Don't think so. He will tell the story of the missing characters in this novel, don't you think? So when we will know what happened to Brienne? In the novel AFTER A Dance of Dragons. Yes. Maybe it will come out in 2008, but you know, i doubt it.  <br /> <br />A Feast for Crows is a caracter study. And that of following characters: Cersei, Jaime, Brienne, Samwell Tarly, Sansa, Arya, Dorne Princesses and Victarion of the Ironborn. I see that some of you shudder. You don't see the likes of Tyrion or Dany here, make no mistake. Cersei is the by far most interesting one of these listed here but even in her chapters boredom occasionally sets in. Her plot - of course - ends in a cliffhanger too.  <br /> <br />Plotwise nothing really happens. The Ironborn are invading Westeros - hahaha, talk about major plot incidents! - Dragonstone is conquered and young Loras is wounded gravely. I think that is it. Oh and some dornish ladies conspire against their fathers. Not very long, though... <br />If you thought you will witness the great attack of the OTHERS or at last the coming of Dany Stormborn, think again. Nothing happens in this regard. And that is the great story! Dany against the Others, that is clear. And nothing really moves in this regard. But we have wonderful chapters about Samwell Tarly retching on board to Oldtown and making love to Gilly. Don't get me wrong i am all for caracter emotions but why did i feel the surge to throttle Samwell Tarly all the time? Must be something wrong with me. Oh and Tarly doesn't change. He changed very much in STORMs where he killed an Other and made a bastard lord commander (great feats!) but in Feast he is only retching all the time. <br /> <br />Many have said Martin had many problems with Feast. I concurr. He himself stated something like that on his website. But...i don't think this is the real problem here. Come on, you don't need to make much to move the plot forwards: Dany to Westeros, The others over the Wall...but he didn't want to do this on purpose. He wanted to stretch the series. He just didn't want to end it in six books. <br /> <br />And it shows. Many of you who applaud Feast just desillusion yourself. Answer truthfully: Do you spend 25$ to just witness a break in the story? A rebuilding of powerbases and lifes? A laying of groundwork for other novels? Please think that over. Doesn't it sound utterly mad to think like this?  <br /> <br />Maybe it's me. Maybe i am different. I am a Martin Fan, yes, but i want 100% from him. No break, No rebuilding, no laying of groundwork...no act 2, scene 1 crap. That's just stupid. I want the same i had in the first three novels: A wonderfully paced narrative, full of compelling characters deeply set in themes of hommages to Tolkien, War of Roses and Shakespeare and Greek Tragedy Theatre with a dose of Horror to finish it off. <br /> <br />Instead i got a Halfbook. I got Tyrion Lannister of the Ice and Fire Series, but without the wit, charme and passion of the great dwarf. <br />

B000B0WO0I|4.0|Though the band has never had a bad album and presumably never will, a covers album had to be in their midst.  When you have been a group for 20 odd years it has to be done.  The difference here is that the idea of a covers album is now something innovative.  These days anyone can do a covers album.  Simply Red's difference is that they've decided to cover their own songs.  Stroke of genius? For the most part.  It's cool to hear some of these tracks in a different way.  That said you do still run into just a few clunkers.  First and foremost...Mick decided to redo my favorite Simply Red song...Fairground...All I have to say is Uh Oh.  To turn it into a tepid dragging torch song...kind of kills the majesty of the original.  I loved the song because of the thumping jungle beat and the soulful keyboard fills.  Also missing from this version is the scorching chorus now only a single ember from a tea light.  I can forgive this one travesty.  Also annoying is the nearly soundalike More.  It was good originally why redo it and have it sound nearly the same?  Same goes for Sad Old Red, which is still a great song but this one is missing the same menacing quality of the earlier version.  Mick was kind of a weirdo when Picture Book came out.  Did anyone notice the grunting and monster noises on the Classic \\"No Direction.\\"  Finally one more thing about the album was it could've been longer.  Granted these days CD Age projects from the earlier 90's where artists took advantage of the length of a CD are now spent, but some albums you just wish would be longer.  This is one of them.  Another let down seeing as Toni Braxton's exquisite Libra is only a scant 40 minutes exactly.  Enough comparison.   <br /> <br />What's Good about Simplified? <br />A lot.  The band old and new has united for a singular tight band sound.  The new tracks particularly Perfect Love showcase why Hucknall is an amazing writer.  Though the latin sound went out in 1999 the track is still funky and innovative.  The cuban singer is a nice touch and once more puts to rest that ridiculous rumor that Mick is gay.  Get over guys, you can't have him.  The other songs are good in a stripped down setting.  The flamenco version of Something Got me Started is great too.  All in all this is a good album by a group that has yet to dissappoint fully.  Get this if you're a fan, get this if you're just starting out...Just get it.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|As a HUGE fan of the original adaptation, (still feel like a kid when I think about it)I was sadly very disappointed with Tim Burton, Depp and Elfman.  The Acting is un-believable and quite silly really.  Why is Depp so uptight about kids?  We never learn why he seems so put out by them.  His \\"okay\\" was even more troubling than Pesci's in lethal Weapon 26.  Elfman lost his way here, the scores and musical numbers are so uninteresting I nearly fell asleep with boredom.  I could not understand half of the lyrics and the single \\"oompa\\" was not cute, interesting or anything you would want to emulate.  I am of the opinion that Burton is a genius, thank heavens for a risk taking eccentric.  Here he became mired in the backgrounds and lost himself in the substance.  I disagree that the author would be proud of this work, wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Not worth buying, rent it and wait until someone dumps their copy on ebay for a buck if you want your own copy.

B00009YXHN|4.0|After the original, Herbert West ( Jeffery Combs) and Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot)have returned from medical miltary duty in South America as they return back home as they have perfected their re-agent formula to continue experimentint. But Herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of Cain's old girlfriend \\"Meg\\" to create the perfect re-animated woman, however Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) has been re-animated back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what West did to him.<br /><br />Not as great as the 1985 cult horror comedy masterpiece \\"Re-Animator\\" but really enjoyable! the acting is kind of average but there's nice splatter in this movie including a variety of odd re-animated critters like a finger creature with a human eye attached done by Screaming Mad George, David Allen (Puppet Master, Q The Winged Serpant and Young Sherlock Holmes). Like the original movie this has dark humor to propell along with gruesomeness, all in all is that it's not a bad follow-up but still worth watching.<br /><br />This DVD is pratically bareboned with a alright transfer with no trailer! but that's ok, if you enjoyed the original then you'll probably like this one as well.
B000002UVX|5.0|This is a live album very different from Hendrix's well crafted studio albums that were full of hit songs. Which is probably why not all people like this album. But I agree with all the glowing reviews here, it's brillant. And whoever said this is overated is clearly NOT a guitar player! Like someone else said this is 45 minutes of nasty, fly funk and the most virtuoso guitar playing that has ever exsisted.  I really like Buddy Miles's drumming and I think it's unfair he always gets a bad rap in comparisons to Mitch Mitchell. People are clearly not opening their ears. BOG is my favourite Hendrix album, it's the album that turned me onto Hendrix, and one that I always go back to more than any of the others.
B00005JNJV|3.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It was everything it was cracked up to be. Good effects, good action... It would have been a great movie had it not been for an insipid performance by Katie Holmes. There are countless other female actresses that could have played that role better. (why oh why?) Try as we did to suspend disbelief and give her a chance to play her character in the dramatic scenes... we never were able to get over the eerie feeling that Dawson's creek made it somehow into the script. She's just not ready for the big screen... Perhaps a few more films might do it. It's a sad case as I would have probably bought this film had it not been for her lackluster performance. On a more positive note... All the other characters and actors were superb.
B000000W5L|5.0|Released in 1972 this is the Rolling Stones best album they ever recorded-and my favourite Stones album. I wish I could award it higher than 5 stars! Although it sounds grainy and underproduced at first, it's genius soon shines through. The music is dark but sweet-emotional with an aching sexuality. This is the blues played the Rolling Stones way. <br /> <br />I think it is such an evocative LP, because they really captured a moment in time. Basicaly the death of the 60's. After this Mick stopped being a rebel and became part of the glamourous jet set. Keith hovered ever closer to the brink of death. Mick Jones fell by the wayside, and Brian's ghost seems to permeate throughout.  In '72 the Stones after being hounded by the establishment in England had wound up as tax exiles in France- after the stardom and excess, the deaths, heartaches, suicides and all comsuming drug habits. It seems to be their ultimate statement on their experiences through that decade-and that they were going to survive.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|When I set down to watch this movie. I had know idea I would come out of the theatre just mesmerized. This movie was Christian Bale at his best. When has he not done better than mediocre work. The film is truly breathtaking and needs to be wached twice to really grasp what is going on.  <br />The character development may be a little slow , but Bale carries the weight throught the entire film. The best film of 2004! <br /> <br />
B000002B2T|5.0|In a \\"one and done\\" fashion, the group behind the music on Above composed an all but perfect masterpiece that will leave you breathless by the final echoes of Layne's voice on \\"All Alone.\\" Trends from each of the members' own bands are regenerated and blended together in a perfectly saturated manner, with elements of exciting Screaming Trees drumming, soothing yet captivating Alice in Chains vocals, catchy and heavy Pearl Jam guitar riffs, all supported by inspiring bass lines, Mad Season will knock your socks off.  <br /> <br />The album ranges in styles from the bluesy I'm Above to the heavy rocking I Don't Know Anything -- there is definitely a little something for everybody. There are a total eight of what you would call normal song structured tracks, with the addition of one enduring instrumental that never loses its tight vise on the listener's attention and the final track being a one-of-a-kind closer that ends the album with a smooth melody backing enchanting vocals of, \\"We're all alone.\\" <br /> <br />No song disappoints, as each one accomplishes several levels of depth that make \\"Above\\" a record that can be replayed until it warps out of shape.
0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock made this dark essay into psychosis as a \\"black comedy\\" (his classification), and that it was, as well as a character study (and what characters), a suspense/mystery, and an outright horror film. So many subthemes surround the characters and their interrelationships (and their respective fates) that whole books can (and have) been written on the subject. What this translates to for the viewer is a film that can be watched one or fifteen times, and can be as fascinating the fifteenth time because (if you pay attention) you'll spot something about it that you didn't see or understand before. (Norman's description of his mother's condition: \\"Why, she's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds over there\\" didn't register through the scariness until I'd seen it at least twice, and ditto for \\"My mother--what's the phrase--hasn't been herself lately\\"). Oh, yeah!!! Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and the rest of the cast were unforgettable in the subtle way the master loved best. Hitchcock's complete mastery of storytelling via cinema has never been more evident than in this wild, quirky film, from the tricky camera work to the double & triple meaning of the dialog to, of course, the set piece of the whole show, the shower sequence, that takes the film in a wholly different direction than you thought it was going at first. Not to be missed, but much to be savored by cinema lovers and horror buffs alike (not to mention, of course, Hitchcock fans).
0739308742|2.0|For those of you who think there isn't enough about your favorite characters in this book, read his explanation.  You'll get more of what you want in the next volume.      I'm very happy with the writing, and would have given this 5 stars if Roy Dotrice had been reading it.  I can't believe they chose to release this with a new narrator.  Roy Dotrice is a much better narrator for this series, and after listening to the first three novels (hours and hours!) his voice has become the characters to me.  I just can't make the adjustment to John Lee.      Random House, if you're listening, please re-release this (unabridged - as always) with Roy Dotrice reading.  I'd rather have a delay in the release of future books than lose Roy Dotrice.

0307276902|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT! IT WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN. MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY AFTER COMING OUT OF AN ADDICTION YOURSELF. I WAS IN A REHAB FOR NARCOTIC ADDICTION AND THE DAY I WAS RELEASED I HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK AND WENT OUT AND BOUGHT IT. JAMES FREY IS SO TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE REHAB AND THE SICKNESS AND THE FEELINGS YOU GO THROUGH IT WAS AT TIMES HARD FOR ME TO READ AS I WANTED THE NARCOTICS AS HE DID, I WANTED TO DIE AS HE DID, IT BROUGHT FLASHBACKS OF THE DETOX, BUT I STILL GIVE IT A 5 STAR AND WILL  READ HIS NEXT BOOK \\"MY FRIEND LEONARD\\".
B00005N9CV|5.0|You may not like every song that was selected, but with few exceptions, the arrangements are sumptuous, gorgeous and innovative approaches to each. For example, I would never list \\"Love Letters\\" among my favorite songs, but was it ever made more beautiful? A never-heard-before intro, beautiful strings, lovely singing by Diana Krall - can't get it out of my head. Same comments apply to \\"The Look of Love\\", Maybe You'll Be There\\", \\"S'Wonderful\\". Personally, I felt less strongly about \\"Besame Mucho\\" - too similar to some of the others - but then comes \\"I Get Along Without You\\" and my repeat button gets worn out again. Great, great album - like Tony Bennett's comeback \\"Art of Excellence\\" and Sinatra's saloon song albums. If you liked them, you have to buy this. It may take a few plays but I predict it becomes a favorite. And you'll want to see her.

B00003CXAW|5.0|So much has been written about this classic, but one aspect that is never touched upon, as far as I am aware, is the contribution by the actors who played the sailors, the natives, and the New Yorkers fleeing in the wake of the escaped Kong. Whole scenes from motion pictures were further improved by how well extras did in crowd scenes especially those involving intense emotion. Frank Capra knew the importance of extras. It has been noted that he would assign to them mini character biographies as a way to help the extras get into a particular scene. In \\"King Kong\\", the sailors seem to be right off of a real freighter, though many of them (Dick Curtis, Charlie Sullivan, Ethan Laidlaw, etc.) were actors who appeared in everything from W.B. gangster films to Three Stooges 2-reelers to Saturday matinee westerns. Their general demeanor, as well as their terror when they are set upon by dinosaurs, brings an extra depth to the proceedings. The frenzy of the island natives, preparing Ann for the sacrifical altar, pushes the excitement to a fever pitch. Be aware of the fantastic job of horror exhibited by the extras in the 3rd Avenue el sequence. The contribution by the extras in \\"King Kong\\" profoundly contributes to the quality status of this movie. The little things count as much as the big things in making a movie. Great film makers know this fact.
B000062YAZ|5.0|It's funny, I first heard about Slayer and this album back in the 80's when Geffen refused to put it out, citing the incendiary (for that time) nature of the material.  Of course, that's the same record label that gleefully put out Guns n' Roses, not caring about the furor over allegations that Axl was racist, etc. <br /> <br />When I first got the record, I WAS FLOORED!  I had never heard such a powerful band, in terms of the speed, the thunderous Dave Lombardo beats, the musicianship and the utter venom of Tony Araya's vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Angel of Death\\" is a graphic and sadly true tale of what Dr. Josef Mengele did to Jews and others during his time in the Nazi death camps, in all its gore.  The power of Lombardo's drum solo and the guitar work of Kerry King and Jeff Hannemann is crazy to the extreme.  Araya primal screams add to the terror or whatever it is you experience. <br /> <br />\\"Necrophobic\\" is about a minute and a half of verbiage (Strangulationmutilationcancerofthebrain...)...a lot of this goes right to the heart of those who like their metal the nastier the better, but there are much better songs, like the aforementioned \\"Angel.\\" <br /> <br />I don't really think Slayer has anything to do with Satanism (which is merely the mirror image of Christianity), or I think their stuff would be less entertaining and even more morbid than it is.  \\"Jesus Saves\\" points the finger at Christianity for its contradictions and hypocrisy (that some seem to ignore in that faith), much in the way \\"Reborn\\" does. <br /> <br />One of the scariest records I'd ever heard, and its power gets me to this day.  Beyond the Geffen controversy, I'd still put this up there as one of Slayer's very best.  <br />
1400032717|4.0|I usually enjoy hearing myself read books.  Some I insist on reading out-loud (think Jane Austin).  There is something I love about prose.  This book is disarming, it is the voice of a young man with autism; and it is engaging! <br /> <br />The plot flows naturally and has many enjoyable, even funny, turns.  But it is the life of someone with autism that is most interesting.  Not having ever met someone with this disability it was better than reading a book on the subject to find out more.
B00021R7CG|4.0|Dramas based upon the cold war have a long history stretching back to the 50s. Most of the good ones were from early in the era. This one comes from near the end but it is a surprising good one.  <br /> <br />The story is fairly predictable. Because of a misunderstanding, a nuclear conflict is initiated. There are various opportunities to draw things back but, because of a few bloodthirsty types, usually in US, the conflict continues to escalate and the horror continues to increase.  <br /> <br />The show continues a few stereotypes: <br /> <br />Pilots are self centered and vain.  <br /> <br />Women don't have the commitment to accomplish a hard mission.  <br /> <br />Praying/Christian types are war mongers. <br /> <br />The Soviet Union isn't all that bad. <br /> <br />The US Navy is morally and intellectually superior to the other service (OK, this one is just my bias) <br /> <br />Nuclear wars are absurdly easy to trigger. <br /> <br /> <br />Despite the predictability, the film works. It is interesting, it has some interesting characters, it presents some horrible possibilities and there are some really honorable people. James Earl Jones in particular gives a strong and honorable performance as the airborne commander of the Looking Glass plane. <br /> <br />This is not very  enlightening or edifying but it was interesting. Its worth watching if you have nothing better to do. <br />
0143034901|5.0|Read This!!!!!  Beautifully written, tragically told.  What a fantastic book.
B00000016N|5.0|This album is regarded as one of the best debut-albums ever made. Probably correct. There haven't been a lot of bands with a song as charismatic as The End on their first album. The album shows the Doors for what they were musically and lyrically.  <br />A little bit of criticism is at it's place bacause the album has it's weaker moments. The Doors got better over the years and this album has a fierce sound (that is typical for that period of the history of recording studio's) and not every song does as much to you as The End does. I believe that not even the still living Doors would disagree about that. But let's focus on the best parts of the album, because it's an album everybody with an interest in music and poetry should own. <br /> <br />The best songs on the album are Break On Through (To The Other Side), The Crystal Ship, Light My Fire and The End. These songs are of such unbelievable high level for a debut-album that it's not strange that there are so little new bands reaching the level of the Doors. If you compare this album to the first one of the Beatles or the Stones (hail to both of them) you must agree: this one says a lot more. <br />The album has the high flying guitar, the mystic running groovy organ, the great free jazzy drumming and the poetic strength the Doors are famous for. <br /> <br />Something about two of the songs: <br />Break On Through (To The Other Side):  In poetry there are some programatic first poems to be found (at least in Dutch poetry) in the poetry of new poets. In rock-music that's an exeption. What would have been more programatic for the music and the lyrics of the Doors than this song? It says almost everything about what the Doors were all about.  <br />The End: When I was at puberty I found the part of The End that says: `father, I want to kill you, mother I want to...' to be a little shocking (especialy for others..). When I got to know to stories of the ancient Greek I found out that there really wasn't anything shocking about this song, exept the fact that Morrison put the story about Oidipus and the Freudian version of it into clear words. I still believe The End has a more honost and direct way to put the Oidipous-complex into words. Nothing more (or less) than poetic freedom.  <br /> <br />To give stars for an album is difficult. For it's importance in pop- and doors-history this album must have 5 stars. The End is more worth than five stars and some other songs are real good too. But the album put into perspective of the whole Doors-oeuvre would be a 4-star-album, with the four songs I mentioned earlier definitly bringing it up to five stars. <br />(For more comments on The Doors: look up my other Doors-reviews)  <br />
B000A88EVE|3.0|I had thought for a while about purchasing this Criterion edition . One need have no hesitation in buying their actual product most of the time due to the quality of the presentation . I have to say I was impressed as usual , as I own a few of their DVD's , though their latest releases have not been to my taste .  <br /> <br />This film has certainly left an impression on me , but not a good one . I had read it was a 'downer' and that is certainly true . Among the highlights of this film are those times when it seems David Bowie is acting very well indeed . <br />One could uncharitably argue that since he is playing an alien trying to be human , the viewer can give him a bit of leeway . <br /> <br />I did enjoy his performance and that was the main selling point for me , though I do own other films by the same director . <br />My problem has been wanting to sit through them , as they are non linear narratives , which can be fascinating . <br />Other times , that approach can simply be boring and/or wearing to the viewer .  <br /> <br />I'm sure the film is beautifully shot , but even I though I usually enjoy the widescreen image , this film seemed a bit on the empty side somehow . Maybe this is supposed to reflect the tone of the story . <br /> <br />I recommend you rent this first - it is a cross between a science fiction film and an art film . I suppose there are some elements that fit into the 70's paranoia films about big business , such as THE PARALLAX VIEW . The story takes a while to come together , which was also a little taxing . <br />It is a film about failure and disappointment . <br /> <br />You will see an unforgettable film in a great package .  <br />However , be prepared to be depressed - watch it when you're in a good mood , as you can only go south from there . <br /> <br />
B0002O0CM0|4.0|I never wanted to dislike the two Doors-albums without Jim Morrison. Krieger, Densmore and Manzarek are musicians that probably also could have made it without Morrison, but in a different way and in a different band maybe.  <br />No doubt about the fact that they would have needed a good singer. The problem is that there aren't that many real charismatic singers in rock-music. Bono may be the only exeption. (By the way, I believe there are other `ways' than Morrison-like charisma to be a good musician.) <br />I believe the Doors could never been as great as they were without Morrison, but he wasn't the only member of the group. What would the Doors have been without the great free and sometimes complex drumming of Densmore, the spooky guitar of Krieger and the lyrical playing of Manzarek? When The Music's Over couldn't have been made without any of them. <br />This album is like every solo-album of the Beatles after they broke up: the (5) Beatles together were more than the separate Beatles, tough they made some good songs.  <br />Songs like Verdilac, The Piano Bird, The Peking King And The New York Queen still have more potential than a lot of songs of other bands, but they lack power, real soul, the great lyrics the Doors had before and a voice to bring a message across.   <br />
B00080ZG10|3.0|If you can overlook the terrible miscasting of Leonardo Dicapprio as Howard Hughes then you'll probably enjoy this sumptuous rendering of old Hollywood. Martin Scorsese has this fatal quirk of using his favorite performers in movie after movie. Even when that star is totally not the right one. This is the case here where Leo looks more like a high school kid trying to act in a high school play than a quirky multi-millionaire.. The role demanded a lean, intense black-haired man, who had his own eccentric way of moving and talking. To enact this, Leo throws hissy fits in which he looks even more like a teenager. Why, oh, why couldn't Scorsese have seen beyond his infatuation with Leo and picked a more appropriate actor? Anyway, this movie is worth seeing at least once.
B0000019PA|5.0|An amazing album. I've been trying all day to come up with words to convey the feel of this sequence of musical poems. I might die happy knowing everyone on earth had heard it before they died...in an aeroplane over the sea or in the arms of their favorite family, all on eggzovereasy... My only fear is that any follow-up won't be able to touch this. Could be that's why Jeff Magnum hasn't tried, at least not under this name. This is the best of the Elephant 6 offerings.
B000002MU3|5.0|I think too many people felt this album was just a temporary phase that REM was going through. An angry album with distorted guitars and even more confusing lyrics than usual. We could tap our feet to \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth\\" and then wait for the next more reserved and polished REM album. Well, we were wrong. This is a very intelligent album with several unheralded masterpieces. \\"Let Me In\\" and \\"Tongue\\" are two of REM's greatest eclectic tracks. \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" and \\"Circus Envy\\" are equally brilliant. Monster is the one REM release that really does not compare to any of their other releases, but I do not see that as a fault, but rather, what makes it so unique and great.
B000002JKS|4.0|I felt I had to write in because of the mostly negative reviews of this effort. <br />Maybe it is because most of these people dont know what they like, but like what they know. <br />The band is the best he has ever played with, the sound is very, very good and all of the songs are good. Some are better than just good. The other records have one or two songs, this, on a whole, is the best record he has put out. I say, listen again!
0385513755|4.0|Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestsellers, including Digital Fortress, Angels & Demons, and Deception Point. His acclaimed novel-The Da Vinci Code-has become one of the most widely read novels in history, breaking numerous records as the `best selling adult novel of all time within a one-year period.'<br /><br />Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman, the Oscar®-winning director and writer of \\"A Beautiful Mind,' have now reunited to bring Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code to the silver screen in May, 2006.<br /><br />Author Dan Brown has written a thriller story involving secret societies, conspiracies, the Catholic Church, and the fictional \\"truth\\" about Jesus Christ. Brown's story alleges that the Catholic Church is perpetuating a centuries-long conspiracy to hide the \\"truth\\" about Jesus Christ from the public, and it or its agents are willing to stop at nothing, including murder, to do so.<br /><br />The author's own word neatly summarizes the storyline:<br /><br />\\"A renowned Harvard symbologist is summoned to the Louvre Museum to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to (Leonardo) Da Vinci's artwork. In decrypting the code, he uncovers the key to one of the greatest mysteries of all time...and he becomes a hunted man.\\"<br /><br />Several of the points that the book promotes have provided the grist for extensive media coverage. These include:<br /><br />* Jesus is not God; he was only man.<br /><br />* Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene.<br /><br />* Mary Magdalene is to be worshiped as a goddess.<br /><br />* Jesus got her pregnant, and the two had a daughter.<br /><br />* The Bible was put together by a pagan Roman emperor.<br /><br />While the book is an excellent read, those with little knowledge of history have accepted this novel as factual. And Brown, to stimulate sales, has gone out of his way to perpetuate this myth by stating that it was meticulously researched. The reader is advised to investigate several available websites detailing \\"the research\\" and Brown's lack of regard for facts.h\\" and Brown's lack of regard for facts.  <br /> <br />
B000001F75|4.0|Back in '73 I'd never heard of Thin Lizzy, but pitchers of their records were in record stores over in Europe & music rags featured ads for something called Tales of [or from] a Blue Orphanage: they were popular on the continent.    In the home where I worked, there in Germany, the 16 year old with the muscular dystrophy had me put the record on the turntable. His big head bobbed over his withered body.    Wow! Whiskey in the Jar, Little Girl in Bloom, even Hero & the Madman: why wasn't this stuff on the college radio station? When I departed for the US of A & home, the kid gave me that record.    So, 30+ years later, after I reduced the vinyl to pops, crackles, & fuzz, I bought the CD: don't know where those extree songs are from, but Whiskey in the Jar(oh), My Mama Nature, Song for While I'm Away remain fiery stuff. (Whiskey in the Jar sounds like some 13th-century Meistersaenger ode & it is.) By the time T.L. was on radio, Lynott sounded like Springsteen & was a couple years from dead.    Nope, can't go wrong with Vagabonds: tura lura lura lye.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|i only got into them recently, and actually prefer \\"howl\\" over their previous albums. here they sound like an american band imitating a british band imitating an american band-and it works, beautifully! i wouldn't go so far as to say don't buy this if you like the first two, since even when their songs are all-acoustic, the production is HUGE and chunky, to the point where you don't really miss the rock bombast. anyway, one of the more memorable changes of direction in recent rock history, imho.
B000001ELL|5.0|Dynasty has the slickest production of all of KISS's studio work.  There is not a bad track to be found and the guitar work is excellent.  Paul plays a lot of the leads on the album and Frehley has 3 outstanding tracks making this one of the most diverse and interesting albums in their extensive catalog.  KISS was fractured as a group at this point and it's basically a Simmons, Stanley, Frehley solo effort with Criss throwing in one track for good measure.  Anton Fig handles the drum duties extremely well, since Criss was not up to the task according to producer Vini Poncia.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I think this series is one of the best series out there right now.  I think both adults and young adults could enjoy this show.  I did not know about this show because it is not on one of the major networks, but I do not like to miss an episode.   <br />I feel like this show does not depict Veronica as a perfect teenager.  It shows her engaging in parties, kissing boys, etc, which is normal for a high school student.  Also, her means of figuring out things are not urealistic.  Her dad and her have a \\"normal\\" relationship.  They disagree every once in awhile, she gets jealous of him dating other women, and she always wants her mom to come back.  I think everyone does a great job acting, espically Kristen.  She is very witty, but when it comes to serious scenes, I feel that she does an exceptional job!  Lastly, I love all the little investigations she works on while finding out little information about her friend, Lilly Kane's, murder.  I bought this series and finished it within a few days because I was so excited to see the next episode.  I am very excited about this new season.  I hope a lot of people watch this so that this series can continue!  I would recommend this to anyone, I have a lot of people hooked on this show already! <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|This CD BLEEDS PURE AMERICAN HEAVY METAL.... Don't care what others say bout LOG, they know nothing!!!! Ashes of The Wake easily the best album made by LOG. Want real thrash metal? Get this and you'll never be disappointed. Also get Burn The Priest, pure brutality!!!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|Ok...This is in my top three favorite movies of all time.  I just want to get that out of the way.  But you don't have to love this movie to see that Katie's review is completely ridiculous! Did you actually watch this movie Katie???  <br /> <br />Allow me to explain: <br /> <br />\\"...so instead they rely on a crazy coincidence: it just SO HAPPENED that the night Andy was drunk and considering shooting his wife and her lover, they got murdered by someone else! Wow! Now THAT is timing!\\"   <br /> <br />-Uhhhh...that's only the whole premise to the freakin' story!  the rest of the plot would fall apart if that wasn't part of it.  Just a guy busting out of prison? The fact that he is actually innocent is the whole tamale.  And what's wrong with thinking people wouldn't sympathize with a murderer?  it's true! People would have a hard time with that.  And even if they did sympathize with him...they probably wouldn't be cool with a murderer busting out of prison.  The viewer is that much more excited that an innocent man busted out and made good. <br /> <br />\\"The part that was most ridiculous to me was when they killed Tommy. Why wouldn't they let Andy get a retrial? Why did they actually MURDER the kid and not just, like, threaten him or send him to an insane asylum or something? \\" <br /> <br />--Ok...this is the most ridiculous one of all.  This is what makes me think you just didn't pay attention. The Warden doesn't want Andy to get a retrial because Andy is the guy running all his scams!! Not only that...but Andy might tip off the authorities to what the Warden was doing if he got out.  Remember...the warden was kind of a jerk.  And Tommy was only 2 years away from getting out of Shawshank...if the Warden didn't help Andy out..Tommy would have just done it himself as soon as he was out.  And what do you mean \\"put him in an insane asylum\\"??  So the warden can just throw anyone he wants into an insane asylum and that person is never evaluated by doctors??? <br /> <br />\\"Another part that I found rather dumb was how Andy escaped. I guessed from day one that he kept that rock hammer in the Bible; it's one of the most cliche stowing places of all time, so why wouldn't they check it during a cell inspection? Wouldn't they also make sure that nothing was behind a poster? \\" <br /> <br />--After the first cell inspection (when Andy held it close to him...trying to hide it)  he became the Warden's pet convict.  He was shown all kinds of favortism after that.  They let things slide. <br /> <br />\\"And I'd like to know how a former convict breaking parole could make it to Mexico\\" <br /> <br />--If it's Andy you are talking about..he had that whole fake identity thing set up...remember???  If it's Red you are talking about...this was the 60's..they didn't have automated systems to check parole status..Even today...any American can go over the border into Mexico without showing his ID...ever been to Tijuana?? sheeeeshh...this is waaay too easy <br /> <br />\\"Also, how the heck Andy got a suit to go to the banks in\\"  <br /> <br />--Once again...did you actually SEE this movie???  It was the WARDEN'S suit that he was supposed to take to the laudry...he was wearing it underneath his prison uniform when he went back to his cell <br /> <br />Finally....\\"Why is it called the Shawshank Redemption if Andy is innocent? And no one else was redeemed\\" <br /> <br />--Red was the character they were referring to. Remember...the story is told from his perspective...and don't forget that little insignificant scene when he finally gets his parole approved. <br /> <br />if you have any questions....ten33dispatcher@sbcglobal.net
0385504209|2.0|I can only give this book two stars for the fact that I am only half way through it and don't really intend to finish it, unlike the first reviewer who said they couldn't put this down, I couldn't pick it up. I don't totaly know why,although I know that the atack on the Catholic Church had something to do with it, and with all the uproar and how people started to say really bad things about them and using thinks in this book as an example, answer this question. What is this book classified in? If you answered fiction you are correct, and that is pretty self explanitory, and I know what your thinking \\"She doesn't like Dan Brown books at all and she is probably Catholic because she's defending then etc...\\"<br />I love Dan Browns writing the suspence is really awesome, I just think that this book is not in any way his best people I think only like it for the reason that it bashes religion, and well yes I am Catholic, haven't you noticed that people are not allowed to say anything bad about (for instance) someone who is Jewish....they get in big trouble for that....have you noticed now that people are openly bashing Catholics? Why is this? This book I think was a major influsence and many people turned away from their faith because of it. Unlike what many others say I don't recomend this book, but if you look at deception point I am going to leave a review for it there and it will be quite the opposite to what I posted here.<br />And note to Catholics, if you are strugling in your faith don't read this for it will probably only seperate you more from God.<br />p.s. I know in a way this is kind of Ironic but I read Angels and Demons and I loved it
1592400876|1.0|I was reading a newspaper article about the author's appearance in San Francisco when I noticed the interesting book title. I believe it is incorrect, though. Shouldn't it be: <br /> <br />Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero-Tolerance Approach to Punctuation? <br /> <br />\\"Zero\\" and \\"Tolerance\\" both modify \\"Approach,\\" but neither can stand alone as a modifier. There should be a hyphen between these compound adjectives.
B000AYQJJ2|4.0|In response to the request from his friend Ravi Shankar, George Harrison organized some friends and musicians to host this benefit concert that would put Bangladesh on the map.  This is an outstanding concert which features superb performances by great artists:  Ravi Shankar, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Klaus Voorman, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell, and Bob Dylan.  <br /> <br />The long sitar piece by Shankar is a bit hard to endure but after that, the performances are much more accessible.  I really enjoyed Harrison's performances of his familiar Beatle songs and solo works (Something, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Here Comes the Sun, My Sweet Lord) -- his performance is really special because this concert was held in 1971, a year after the Beatles broke up.  Eric Clapton is great as usual- his slide guitar work is always tasteful.  Leon Russell is good in \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\";  one of the highlights of the concert is the song medley by Bob Dylan (A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall, Just Like a Woman, Blowin' in the Wind, etc.).  The concert ends with a rousing re-endition of \\"Bangla-Desh.\\"   <br /> <br />Even though the concert is really great, the picture quality leaves much to be desired.  The picture looked like it was transferred from a video.  The sound quality was good but not great.   <br /> <br />There are some special features that are interesting -- such as the making of the concert and interviews of the cast and the musicians who participated in this historic concert.  <br /> <br />If you're a Beatle, Harrison, Clapton, and/or Dylan fan, you'd love this DVD and performance.  You'll have to bear with the mediocre picture and sound quality.  Aside from that, this DVD is really worth having.
B000BHHVPO|3.0|No a-ha?  No Dido's \\"Thank You\\" or \\"White Flag\\".  No Green Day doing \\"We Will Rock You\\"?    Very disappointed in those omissions.  Just an FYI, as I'm still giving the set 3 stars.  Sound and video quality is excellent.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Let me tell you one thing right off: before I began watching \\"Smallville\\", I was NOT a Superman fan.  I loved comic characters as a kid - Batman and Spider-Man especially.  Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker were interesting, emotion-filled, lifelike characters, and I loved them.  But Superman - to me, Superman was dull, the stereotypical superhero.  He was a stone, no drive, just flying around saving people and fighting aliens.  I never understood why he was so popular.    Well, my opinion of Superman sure has changed.    Over the last year I've been in \\"experimental mode\\" - that is, if I see something that seems interesting, I'll buy it and check out.  \\"Smallville\\" sounded somewhat interesting and it had a large fan base, so I figured, What the heck, I'll check it out.  And boy, am I glad I did.    \\"Smallville\\" is set during a time in Superman's life that has rarely been explored: his teenage years.  Throughout the show, young Clark Kent discovers his abilities and uses them to help (and, more often, save) others, all the while trying to mask his powers from the public - as well as his friends.  These friends are Pete, Clark's old best friend, and Chloe, the determined, curious head of the school newspaper.  And then there's Clark's best friend - Lex Luthor.    Superman fans who have not seen or heard of the show (are there any?) surely just exclaimed \\"What the f!*k!  Lex is Clark's best friend?!?!?!\\"  Yes, he is.  And that's just one of the many twists the show has.    After I began watching \\"Smallville\\", I became very interested in the Superman mythos, so I scoured around and researched the character while watching other Superman-related entertainment.  Many Superman fans have come to hate \\"Smallville\\", because they say it messes up the Superman legend.  Now that I have a basic understanding of the Superman legend - well, maybe a little above basic - I think the exact opposite.  \\"Smallville\\" definitely changes around the Superman timeline, but only so much as to irritate die-hard fans only.  I think that the changes make the show fresh, and they're always interesting - the twists the show's creators have put in leave even Superman fans wondering who's gonna pop up next.    Now back to show.  The casting is really fantastic.  Tom Welling was a perfect choice for Clark Kent.  He does a great job showing the many emotions Clark is feeling.  Kristin Kreuk is a great Lana.  She makes an otherwise unspectacular character very interesting.  Allison Mack is a fine choice for Chloe (she kind of reminds me of Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars).  John Schneider and Annette O'Toole play Clark's parents, and they both do a great job.  John Glover is perfectly cast as Lex's rich, ruthless father.  But for me, the real stand-out in the cast is Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor.  I've seen just about all the actors to portray Lex Luthor, and I've gotta say, in my opinion Michael does the best job.  Definitely a great choice.    There isn't a bad episode in the entire first season.  Throughout the first half of the season, the show uses the same formula that \\"Buffy\\" used for its first season: in each episode, Clark must battle a different Kryptonite-created mutant.  (Well, in \\"Buffy\\" they weren't Kryptonite-created, but it was still the Hero vs. Monster formula)  But for the second half of the season, we're treated to very different storylines in each episode, each one being unique and absorbing.  It's a very well-written show.    Definitely one of my favorite parts of the show is the music.  The show premiered when I was 11, so it's great to hear all these old hits that I remember on the show.  The show has a fantastic soundtrack, with loads of major songs in each episode.  The music really adds to the show.  One song obviously worth noting is Remy Zero's very fitting theme song, \\"Save Me\\".    I was hooked on the show from the first episode, and I think anyone that gives the show a chance will be as well.  It's a clever, immensely entertaining, well-written show that is easily one of my favorites ever.  \\"Smallville\\": Season One is a terrific beginning to one of the finest shows on television.    TOP 5 OF THE SEASON    1. \\"Tempest\\"  2. \\"Pilot\\"  3. \\"Zero\\"  4. \\"Nicodemus\\"  5. \\"Cool\\"
B00097DXZS|1.0|First the rootkit - many Sony/BMG music CD's install a 'rootkit' - a commonly used hacker backdoor trick - on your Windows PC if you play them on your computer. This disc employs a different but still invasive method licensed by Sony from Sunncomm. It's not just a matter of copy protection, it's a matter of security, performance and system stability. Sony/BMG CD's will negatively impact all three. Don't buy this CD for that reason alone, or at the very least, don't play it on your Windows PC.    Second, the music. I used to be a big fan of Santana (the guitarist and the band) and Supernatural, although a weaker effort than the 'old' Santana, gave me hope that Carlos might be on the return. 'All That I Am' is a disappointing step in the other direction. It literally sounds like the tracks were recorded and Carlos came in on his lunch hour and improvised solos over the top of a finished mix. His tone is wretched, his playing is uninspired and his contribution is more name than music. Want to hear some passion, some fire, some *real* Santana? Go find Abraxas or one of his band releases from the early 70's. Skip this watered down, computer trashing, phoned in muzak.
B000AL730O|5.0|Since the break up of the Beatles, Paul McCartney for the most part has been a man of singles.  His albums have produced some great singles but much filler acompanied those great songs.  Along comes \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\".  Hearing this album for the first time is like listening to \\"Pet Sounds\\" for the first time.  The complex sound and maturity of this album is beyond anything McCartney has done in decades.  The flow of the album is amazing.  The last track, \\"Anyway\\", might even be my new favorite solo McCartney song.  I couln't have been happier with this album and I hope any true music lover will feel the same way.  I had to take some time to write the review.  I had to make sure the album didn't get old on me.  It only got better.  So far, this is the best album of the year.
0307276902|5.0|When I found this book under \\"Self-help\\" in a super-chain bookstore, I wondered to myself what I was getting into.  Although, this book is about James Frey's rehabilitation period, it is more than a stranger's life.  Frey's introduction of his life is very captivating.  The words that are on each page are so vivid that the reader begins to feel as James.  As you read the book you wonder how can a man endure such thing?  James Frey led an incredible life, but he also wrote an outstanding memoir.  Frey is an extremely intelligent and brilliant writer.  After you're done with this book, be sure to pick up his second book (sequel memoir) \\"My Friend Leonard\\".
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I'm not normally a Tim Burton fan.  Just the previews of his movies usually look weird enough to me that I pass right on by.  But, since this was a new version of one of my favorite books from childhood, I had to give it a chance.<br /><br />To be honest, I've never been a fan of the original movie version, either.  It took too many liberties with the story, changing the entire makeup of Charlie in the process and missing the point of the story.  But that's a rant for a different review.  The reason I bring it up here is because I went into this one hoping to love it and without the baggage of liking the previous one.<br /><br />The story is rather straightforward.  Charlie Bucket comes from a poor family that is barely making ends meet.  It gets even worse after his father looses his job.<br /><br />Charlie loves chocolate, which he gets one day a year - his birthday.  To make matters worse, he lives in the same town as the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, the best candy factory in the world.<br /><br />One day, Willy Wonka announces that he will open his factory to five lucky kids who find the golden tickets in his candy bars.  As the winners come in, they are all selfish, obnoxious children.  Charlie doesn't have a chance of getting to go.  Or does he?  And what wonders await the winners in the factory?<br /><br />The movie is visually stunning.  This is a playground I would love to visit in person.  The colors are vibrant and everything is interesting.  Tim Burton obviously had a wonderful time creating the visuals to match the book.  In addition, much of the humor remains, including great puns and the wonderful scene with the chocolate mansion.<br /><br />Speaking of the book, this movie does a better job of sticking to the story in most areas, but especially in one key area, Charlie.  While he can come across as a goody-two-shoes at times (a problem with the book as well), just about anyone would with the obnoxious brats for comparison.  The original movie tried to fix that problem, but I much prefer him this way.<br /><br />The movie gets so much of the basic plot right, any fan of the book will love it.  With the advance of special effects, the story is brought to visual life in ways that weren't possible 30 years ago when the original came out.  While the characters have been modernized a little, it adds to the story rather then detracts from it.<br /><br />The real problem comes with the added back-story.  Willy Wonka now has a past involving a dentist father who hated candy.  Frankly, it more detracts then adds to the plot since the point of the movie is the wonders of the factory itself.  It also throws in a theme of the importance of family relationships that seems tacked on to the theme we see most of the time about the importance of behavior and manners.<br /><br />Compounding this is Johnny Depp's weird portrayal of Willy Wonka.  I knew from the previews to expect it, but it still was too over the top.  I left the theater wondering why he wanted to open up his factory period.  Granted, the character is supposed to be a crazy eccentric, but he was never this cold and almost creepy.<br /><br />This movie does have many things going for it.  The visuals, characters, and effects are great.  It's less likely to scare kids then the original, too.  Tim Burton's desire to add a back-story ultimately backfired, however, leaving the book as the best way to familiarize yourself with this story.ginal movie tried to fix that problem, but I much prefer him this way. <br /> <br />The movie gets so much of the basic plot right, any fan of the book will love it.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|Fresh from the Oscar success of \\"Fargo\\" it would have appeared that the Coen brothers had finally found the knack of cracking the \\"mainstream\\".  Then comes this tale of kidnapping, nihilism, pornography and...bowling.  In the masterful hands of the Coens these disparate elements all tie together not unlike the Dude's rug that the Asian thug soiled.  In a career of excellent yet unheralded performances Jeff Bridges' account of the Dude ranks at the top.  John Goodman as Dude's unhinged buddy Walter is probably the best work he's ever done.  Great supporting cast.  And what can you say about a film where Steve Buscemi is the sanest character?  I waited for years to replace my VHS copy of this film with a proper release.  I can't verify whether this \\"Collectors Edition\\" is misleading.  I did like the intro by \\"film preservationist\\" Mortimer Young, though.  The old VHS copy that I owned had Spanish subtitles running across the bottom.  Initially I thought this was another surreal joke by the Coens but a Latino buddy of mine assured me that it wasn't.
B0000024LN|5.0|It's so hard for me to keep a Redman review unbiased, since he's my favourite emcee of all-time, but I'll try anyway.  Back in the day when rappers dropped albums semi-annually (instead of having to wait almost five years for Red Gone Wild!!!), Reggie Noble dropped Muddy Waters.  It is truly a crime that this album doesn't get as much recognition as the other top rap LPs from '96.  Considering the styles of his last two LPs; the P-Funk inspired Whut? Thee Album, and the murky soundscape of Dare Iz A Darkside, Muddy Waters comes off as a combination of the two -- it's ultimately the total package.<br /><br />Those who know Red well should be familiar with his wacky lyrics, and there are plenty of them throughout Muddy Waters.  Red trades some sick lines (peep the title of this review) with K-Solo on the throwback track \\"It's Like That,\\" and \\"Soopaman Luva 3\\" is bananas too, with Reggie Noble kicking another crazy Soopaman story and the song completely changes mid-way through.  Basically, the Funk Doc's blunted metaphors and brain-scrambling lyrics are nothing short of incredible on this album.<br /><br />The beats on Muddy Waters, produced by the Green Eyed Bandit Erick Sermon as usual, are definitely a notch higher than the hazy (but still very good) beats of Dare Iz A Darkside.  His trademark heavy basslines are most certainly a highlight of this album; \\"Whateva Man\\" has one of the tightest hip-hop basslines of all-time, and \\"On Fire\\" isn't too shabby either.  Of course not all the beats on Muddy Waters are produced by E-Dub; Rockwilder and Redman himself do a pretty good job, and the forgotten Fugee, Pras, handled the beat on the tight Red + Meth collaboration track, \\"Do What Ya Feel.\\"<br /><br />If you like wacky lyrics and tight-as-hell beats, Muddy Waters is calling your name.  It's right up there as one of the best rap albums of 1996, along with Reasonable Doubt and ATLiens.  Only Red's debut, 1992's Whut? Thee Album is just a shade better than this.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Best moments: Whateva Man (favourite), Rock Da Spot, Pick It Up, On Fire, Do What Ya Feel feat. Method Man, It's Like That feat. K-Solo, and Soopaman Luva 3.ghly recommended. <br /> <br />Best moments: Whateva Man (favourite), Rock Da Spot, Pick It Up, On Fire, Do What Ya Feel feat. Method Man, It's Like That feat.

0070511136|1.0|I purchased this book after receiving a recommendation from a friend that also works in sales. What a waste of money. This may be the most overrated, redundant sales book that I have ever read. I can summarize the entire book in one sentence: \\"Techniques used in small sales will be ineffective during large sales, and we have the research to prove it.\\" Don't waste your time or money on this book. <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I had a very good feeling that Tim Burton was gonna make a great remake of this classic story. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is definitley one of the year's best films. <br /> <br />This version of Ronald Dahl's famous story is more closer to the book than the first film based on his book. But, I still love the original film. <br /> <br />Both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder play different types of the character Willy Wonka. Depp was more wackier, more comedic and also twisted. Wilder's is more meaner, more saecastic and twisted too. Both actor's did a very good job play Wonka. <br /> <br />The Oompa-Loompas in this film were cool, too. But, I still like the original Oompa-Loompas in the original film better. <br /> <br />Tim Burton brings out a very cool style of the Chocolate Factory and brilliant visuals. This is a fun film for everyone, and definitley a film for the whole family to sit down and have a great time.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|WHAT A GREAT CD!!  ALL OF THE HITS AND TWO NEW SONGS, WHICH ARE SUPERB.  ANNIE'S VOICE ON THE NEW TRACKS IS AMAZING - I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, SHE DOES HER BEST WORK WITH DAVE PRODUCING HER. I MEAN, DIVA WAS A CLASSIC, BUT MEDUSA AND BARE WERE JUST SO-SO. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE INCLUDED \\"SEXCRIME\\"AND A COUPLE SONGS FROM THE MUCH OVERLOOKED \\"WE TOO ARE ONE\\" CD, BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING ON A SINGLE DISC COLLECTION.  BUY IT AND ENJOY.
B000002B7U|5.0|People who underrate this album may be likely to prefer a more agressive Ozzy, like in Ozzmosis(1995) or Down to earth(2001).   The prince of darkness is versatile and can do excellent ballads( Mama I'm coming home   from \\"No more tears\\"or Dreamer from \\"Down to earth\\" for example).  The Ultimate sin (1986) came closer to melodic metal with Jake E. Lee's style. Ozzy sings traditional metal comomnly, but this album had a glam soul. Watch Shot in the Dark´s videoclip to see it proved.  He's not as virtuoso as Randy Rhoads or Zakk Wylde, but he does his goodies too: The excellent and crazy guitar licks ( some of them with finger tapping , a \\" plium plium plium\\",if you don´t know what I mean, 3:22 mark is an example )in   \\"Never\\" especially or at the end of Shot in the dark   ( 3:46 mark -> Ponllonlumlororororooummm.... nearly)  I admit: This my favourite Ozzy album, very well done.  This cd continued what Bark at the moon left off: Ozzy worked his voice better,different to   what we hear in his first two solo albums (Blizzard and Diary of a madman) or in Ozzmosis.  He was less flat or trebled.  The tracks \\"Lightning Strikes\\" and \\"Never know why\\" ,\\"Shot in the dark\\" have one of the favourite topics in hair metal: the rock and roll elevation - > \\" Rocking all night....\\" \\"We never know why we rock, rock, rock....\\" or \\"I can feel my heavy breathing\\"        There's  NO BAD SONG in this genuine masterpiece. However,these are my favourites (10/10):    Shot in the dark -> The beat remembers the first track, but no problem all in all because it's my one of my all-time Ozzy favourites. The chorus is gripping and the riffs are terrific.    That solo... (2:24), incredible feeling,a goldie.     Fool like you -> The intro is incredibly beautiful.Jake used harmonicals ( when we touch the guitar string gently and play above the right fret neck to obtain a music box effect) to do this wonder.    Killer track. 20 /10    Killer of giants -> Awesome ballad. \\"When button is pushed therewill be nowhere to run\\" refers   to what will happen when the Cold War explodes, no survivors. The riffs follow Ozzy singing   notes in the chorus(Killer of Giants, threatens us all, mountains of madness). I like it.   The solo in 3:29 is marvellous,smooth and full of hammer-ons, with the help of wah-wah.    Secret loser-> In opposite to the title this track is a winner.  Beutiful riffs and melody (in 1:35 mainly)  Jake taps his guitar again ( 2:26), but slower than \\"Never\\". This kind  of tapping speed is similar to what Eddie Van Halen used in \\"You´re no good\\"    Ozzy's studio albums from best to worst to me (tested and sincere):    1- Ultimate sin   2- Bark at the moon    3- No more tears/ Blizzard of Ozz / Diary of a madman (Tie)  4- No rest for the wicked  5- Ozzmosis  6- Down to earth
B0002NRRAG|3.0|I would give this about 3.5 stars actually.  It is a very good CD and I absolutely loved it the first couple of months that I had it.  It is definitely a great rainy day or Sunday morning album.  Very french, jazzy, and lazy in feel.  It doesn't disappoint if it is a specific type of atmosphere that you are after.   <br /> <br />While I still like this album now and can imagine myself reaching for it somewhat regularly in the future, I have to admit that it does go from jazzy-French sophistication to tedious and droning after listening to it for any extended amount of time.  Still, it is quite a bit better that most of the music currently out there, particularly that being played on the radio. <br /> <br />Give this one a chance.  It is a definite keeper, I would just recommend it in fairly limited doses.
B00005A1VH|5.0|This is one of the all time great movies.  I never get tried of seeing.  Its Gary Cooper at his best.
B0000214F0|5.0|I'm always grateful to those who research the past and inform us as accuratley as possible as to how things were and how a person lived in a certain place and time.    I had never seen Caligula before and decided to get this unrated version dvd. I've always read about and heard about and seen movies about governments, kings, queens, monarchs, rulers, emperors, princes, dictators, etc. abusing their power and being unfair to the people they rule over, but this guy takes the cake.    I don't mind the constant nudity or the extreme sex or the cruely barbaric sceenes in this movie because that is the way things were for them. It was part of their everyday life. It was the norm.    This movie doesn't ofend me, what it does is it makes me feel grateful i live in the present day and what a long way we've come from those barbaric times.(and still have a long way to go because there's always room for improvment)    Caligula is definitley not a movie to watch with your mom or dad or grandparent or aunt; i know i'd feel humiliated. I watched it with my spouse and that works. We were able to coment back and forth about it and we realy enjoied it.  Not everyone will though, because of the grafic \\"everything\\" but i personaly like knowing about and seeing how this young ruler became drunk with power. It is history after all, and knowing about history is what it's all about is it not? So why shouldn't it be told the way it realy hapened?  No one is obligated to watch anything, but those of us who do want to know and see, should be able to!    If the movie hadn't been a real life story then it would've just been another violence and sex film and we have a million of those. Not that that's not fine too, but for the sake of argument in this case this man did exist and was mad with power and i do believe there's enough to go on to conclude that all these goings on did go on.    The Doors - Great movie because it's about the true lives of Jim Morrison and his band. If this movie wasn'ta true life story it would just be a junk movie.  Same goes for Sid Vicious(Sex Pistols), In The Realm Of The Senses, etc.  So for this movie you have to like nudity, you have to like sex, you have to like watching sex, and be able to watch barbaric violence and rediculous humiliation. Thank you for reading.    ...5 stars          Thank you Tinto Brass.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Okay, there are other reviews to tell you just how strong this movie is and how cool the DVD eventually will be, so I'm gonna use this space to gripe about that cover art. Wow does it look like ass. Wow. It looks as if they pulled a guy off the street, gave him a 30 minute crash course in Photoshop, blindfolded him, let him try and design the cover, took a dump on the results, then packaged it. <br />What's really infuriating is how the cover smacks of what went wrong with the marketing of this movie. I gaurantee there were at least 15 people with their fingers in this pie, saying things like \\"Put a little space battle going on up there in the corner.\\" or \\"Generic qoute at the top will sell DVD's!\\" Cripes. Criiipes. Serenity wasn't that kind of movie. It was above all that. <br />I really can't believe how bad that thing looks. It's sub standard even for typical sci-fi bad montage cover art. Covers like this, and especially the corporate greed mentallity behind it, cheapen film as an art form. Get an artist to design the cover art, not twenty suits and a copy of Photoshop. <br /> <br />I do have to point out how much I loved the movie, though. It put a rather nice cap on the TV series, while still allowing space for possible future endeavors. Hopefully this cover will change by the time it's released.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|i had been long anticipating this movie after being a little less than satisfied with the previous batman movies.  no previous batman film has been very memorable. while  entertaining, they seemed more like that of a child's view of batman.  batman begins bring the previous movies to shame.  christian bale is cast perfectly as batman, and the movie shows a more in depth look at batman's past before he ever wore the suit, and more importantly why he decides to become batman.  the film is intelligent and well worth seeing several times over.
B00097DXZS|1.0|If you're having the same problem, ea-pty wrote a very nice review for the Foo Fighter's \\"In Your Honor\\".
0767802470|5.0|Taut and well-acted drama about a German U-boat crew in WW II. The movie is very realistic and insistent on getting all the details right: the photography is incredible. Perhaps because just about the entire movie takes place inside the sub, usually as it's attacking or being attacked, and none of the crewmen (except for the captain, played by Jurgen Prochnow) ever come alive as individuals, the movie feels mechanical at times: the boat itself becomes the main character.<br /><br />The suspense is amazing, though, and until PRIVATE RYAN came along, there was probably no better war picture that gave viewers a true feeling of what it was like \\"being there\\" in combat. [There are different versions of this movie, from two-and-a-half to over five hours long; unless you are a war movie junkie, the shorter the version the better, I think.]
B0007GAERG|4.0|Being a long time fan of The Voice, I was anxious to see what her latest album held. Though I don't consider the sultry Charmbracelet and funky Glitter flops, she's definitely seen better days. After listening to Mimi, I'll hold to my opinion that she has seen better days, though she definitely found the right formula to regain her radio magic with Mimi. <br /> <br />She starts off with her lead single, \\"It's Like That,\\" a pop-infused song about letting loose and having a great time, reminding everyone that it is after all, the emancipation of Mimi. Jermaine Dupri begins to grate on my nerves here, an annoyance that will get worse as the album continues. However, she sings uses her voice perfectly, never oversinging or undersinging. The ending rap from the then unknown Fatman Scoop conclude the song on just the right note. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard this next track, I don't know what rock you've been hiding under. Clearly the song of the summer, breaking all sorts of airplay and chart records, \\"We Belong Together\\" is widely regarded to as her comeback single, returning her to chart-topping form, where she belongs. The track starts off with a simple piano tune, with her going through the range of emotions of contemplating one's true love. Going through denial, escaping through the radio, throwing things, then finally realizing that she and her lover belong together. Lyrically, the song sounds like it was meant for a more urban artist like Ashanti to sing, but thankfully, Mariah has a much better voice, even today, and pulls it off like no one else can. There's merely a factor <br /> <br />\\"Shake it Off\\" is the next single- groovy and Usher-lite. Its' catchy beat and addicting chorus propelled it to #2, where it was unable to budge Kanye West's \\"Golddigger\\" at #1. This clearly shows her attempt to influence today's urban R&B fans, sounding not much different than whatever's on the hip-hop stations today. Overall, a sound track, if you can get over JD. My majorcomplaint with this song is JD, with his cackling and inviting us to `bounce with him.' No thanks. <br /> <br />The first real misstep is \\"Say Something.\\" Lacking a signature melody, it seems like a jumble of elements thrown hastily together to make a song. Contrary to the music industry's thinking that The Neptunes are the best thing since sliced bread, I think their music lacks creativity and innovation. <br /> <br />The slide continues with \\"Get Your Number.\\" Here, the JD-blabbering gets out of control as he is an actual featuring artist and has lyrical lines. It doesn't even sound like Mariah's song, since she is unable to save the song from JD. JD attempted a career as a singer and failed, and we can clearly see why. The beats sound raunchy, like a bad 1980s porno. It's sampled around \\"Just an Illusion\\" a song from the 1980s. Mariah, have you not learned anything from Glitter? Leave the 80s' alone! And leave JD back there too. <br /> <br />With the re-release, the next single will be \\"Don't Forget About Us.\\" Earlier in her career, she encountered much criticism that her songs were too repetitive (Dreamlover, Fantasy) and then she veered off this track, but with a hit like \\"Belong,\\" she couldn't quite help herself. Why not stick to the formula that made it the biggest song of the decade? With \\"Forget,\\" it's a great track- soulful, excellently production and vocals, but something's missing. Could it be that we heard this song earlier all summer played over and over again? While this song might be a big hit for her, it shows how she's reverting back to her old tactics to manipulate charts and sales, instead of focusing on the music.  However, it's about the music, not her intent, and for that, she deserves a gold star. The music video is also very steamy and one of her sexiest yet, raising eyebrows everywhere. Despite the skin she shows, the video is missing something and is easily forgettable.  <br /> <br />Also on the re-release is the notable \\"So Lonely.\\" Thisis a brilliant, chic, urban track that seems to be stuck on repeat in my car for it's a Mariah hip-hop collaboration that actually works. \\"One and Only\\" features Twista as well, but isn't as strong as \\"Lonely.\\" I also prefer Twista's version, maybe because I heard it first, but it just seems like it's more of Twista's track than Mariah's. <br /> <br />Overall, a valiant attempt to return Mariah to the top. She may be `back,' but I'm not sure where she went in the first place. If anything, the Mariah that her fans know and love still hasn't returned. <br /> <br /> <br />Pros: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake it Off, Stay the Night, Circles, Don't Forget About Us, So Lonely feat. Twista (Twista's version) <br /> <br />Tracks I wish she didn't include: One and Only feat. Twista, To the Floor feat. Nelly, Say Something feat. Snoop Dogg, Get Your Number feat. JD <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CX97|5.0|Crackerjack entertainment - with an insightful \\"war is crazy\\" message to go along with it. A company of British soldiers is captured by the Japanese and forced to build a bridge over the Kwai. A battle of wills develops between the Japanese commander (played by Sessue Hayakawa) and the British one (Alec Guinness) over officers' rights; Guinness wins out and virtually takes over command of the camp, getting the bridge built with typical British efficiency.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an American prisoner (William Holden) escapes and returns with a commando unit set on blowing the bridge up. Guinness's ego has so taken over that when he spots the explosive charges and wires on the bridge, and suddenly realizes what's about to happen, he actually tries to stop it from blowing up. But too late: the bridge is blown to smithereens and so are Guinness and Holden. War's madness.<br /><br />Guinness's slide into insanity is slow and subtle - and totally believable. He will not give the Japanese the satisfaction ever of assuming they can control or intimidate the British; after all, there are rules in war and \\"gentlemen\\" play by the rules. Gentlemen also perform to the best of their abilities, no matter what the task - even if it means building a bridge for the enemy. But he's in this game too deeply and his insanity is a loss of reality.<br /><br />Everything works in this picture, with the biggest winner being British fortitude (though American practicality deserves a pat on the back, too). At first we are caught up in Guinness's seemingly noble actions, all that admirable British stiff upper lip behavior, and when the truth hits us, it's devastating. That's because David Lean's direction is perfect; he's like the poker player who knows he's got the winning Ace up his sleeve and timing is everything. The movies won a fistful of Oscars and deservedly so.
0553801503|1.0|Betrayal is a common thread through the Ice and Fire series first 3 books, and now we find life imitating art as George R.R. Martin pulls a Tywin Lannister on his fans and readers with \\"A Feast of Crows.\\"   <br /> <br />I had to go to his web site after reading it to see what kind of justification could possibly exist for this 4th book. The king of weaving back stories tightly into current POV's suddenly needed to produce a back story tome? About these minor characters and strangers and their boring actions (or inactions, as this case may be)? Give me a break. This was a waste of a lot of good trees and 9 hours of my time, not to mention $28.  <br /> <br />Might not feel so let down if I hadn't waited 5 years to pick up the tales of Tyrion, Daenerys, Arya, Jon, Bran, Sansa, Jamie et al. (All conspicuously absent from this book, except for a few nods to Jamie). I won't be buying another one until I check the chapters to see whose stories actually go FORWARD in the next one. And delve into a few chapters to make sure it goes forward at all, as this one did not. <br /> <br />If the first 3 hadn't been such a feast for readers, this book might have been choked down a little easier.  A \\"Feast for Crows\\" is mighty slim pickin's. It doesn't even add up a good hors d'houvres. Except for a few very tasty tidbits (Cersei gloating over the taste of Robert's unborn children) it's hard to believe George R.R. Martin even wrote this book.  Where is the real Martin and what have you done with him? Give him back and give us readers a real Fire and Ice meal as only Martin can cook up...some of the best brain food on the planet.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|\\"Cats are good. Half-in, half-out anyway.\\" <br /> <br />For fans of theological thrillers or graphic novels, there is something incredibly enticing about the character and adventures of John Constantine in the cult favorite comic Hellblazer. Seen by some as a powerful magician fighting against demons, and by others as a smarmy con-man out for a quick buck, the world behind the world that he inhabits is one ripe for a good mystery with a healthy dose of the bizarre. <br /> <br />The movie adaptation helmed by director Francis Lawrence and starring Keanu Reeves is more of an extrapolation of some of Constantine's comic adventures rather than an adaptation of the exact world and character. John Constantine is now a dark-haired american living in a demon-infested Los Angeles (mmmm, irony) instead of the snarky blond Brit that rowls the comic pages. However, the important things about his character remain largely unchanged. He retains the same pitch-black sense of humor and \\"screw you\\" attitude to the minions of both heaven and hell, and Keanu himself does an admirable job in the role. Perhaps it's just that John Constantine can be such an emotionally dead character, but Keanu does what is easily his best work since donning his trenchcoat and shades in the original Matrix. <br /> <br />The story for John is fairly simple; he sees dead people. Or rather, John Constantine has the rare ability to spot the semi-demons and quasi-angels (termed \\"half-breeds\\") that live among the human population. As a child, it drove him insane and desperate to the point attempted suicide. However, it didn't quite work, and now, knowing that he's destined to burn, Constantine acts as something of a bouncer for the city; whenever a demon tips the balance between good and evil by stepping too far outside the line, he deports them back to hell. he does this not for the sake of doing good, but in the forlorn hope that it'll buy him back into the good book. <br /> <br />This grabs the attention ofRacheal Dobs, a detective who can't believe that her Catholic sister would comit suicide. Suspecting foul play, she enlists the unwilling help of Constantine, and the two start down a road to unravel an unholy mystery involving the Spear of Destiny, psychic powers, and ancient prophecies. <br /> <br />The story for the film is solid enough, but it's really the visual style and the supporting cast that make it enjoyable. Francis Lawrence creates a brilliant atmosphere for the film, along with some geniunely disturbing images of Hell, and does a great job of fitting each scene to its mood, whether it's being defined by performances or music. <br /> <br />As for the supporting cast, they're all incredibly enjoyable. Gavin Rosdale and Tilda Swinton provide great contrast as Balthazar and Gabriel, and Djimon Honsou does a great mystery man as the militantly neutral Pappa Midnight. Even the usually annoying Shia LeBeouf is palatable, and in actually adds a lot to the character of John Constantine. As author Niel Gaiman proved in The Books of Magic, Constantine is most enjoyable to watch when he has a young charge to act as his foil. And watch for a scene-stealing performance from Peter Stormare as the Morning Star himself. <br /> <br />Overall, the film isn't meant to be much more than an exercise in entertaiment with a heavy dose of the macabre, but it manages to be very good at what it does. With very effective use of effects and visual style, along with solid performances, if you like your supernatural thrillers with a touch of the hellish, this is where you should look. <br /> <br />And the two-disk DVD is easily the best deal if you're planning on picking the film up. It has all the special features that the one-disk edition comes with (including some deleted scenes that actually might have improved key points of the film), but also a full second disk of extras looking into the making of the film. It also comes packed with some selected Hellblazer comics, for a lookat the original vision of the Constantine character. <br /> <br />Constantine has a different sort of feel overall than something more fun and self-aware like Hellboy, but it's certainly worth a look if you enjoy films like The Devil's Advocate or The Exorcist. Just come in expecting something. . . different.
B000069HKH|4.0|Like many listeners, I couldn't see past 9/11 for my first six months of playing this record. However after leaving it on the backburner for another year, I realise that much of the album  has no literal connection to 9/11. The tracks all follow a similar theme- loss, rebuilding and rememberance, but there are many tracks that stand alone outside of the context in which they were recorded.  <br /> <br />\\"Waiting on a Sunny Day\\" infects you. No matter how I might try to laugh at a chorus that reads as though it was written for sesame street, I find myself dancing every time I hear it. This is vintage Springsteen: simple, unpretentious, catchy and 100% rock'n'roll. I hate myself, but I love it. Plus it has a killer sax solo. <br /> <br />\\"Counting on a Miracle\\" tends towards cheesy sentimentality at times, especially in the bridge. However, it is more than redeemed by the seamless combination of a relentless rythym section and guitar lines that do not scream, but rather pump the song at an intensity generated by sheer power: not volume or speed. This intensity is rare in modern music- rythym and melody sections that complement and feed off each other rather than competing, and provides the solidest of platforms for the raw energy that is The Boss in full voice. The man is probably the greatest songwriter in the industry at the moment, but I believe he is only at his best when fronting the E- Street band. <br /> <br />\\"Further On (Up the Road)\\" is an incredible track that was probably lucky to see a studio. Written and performed before 2001 at E-Street reunion concerts, it rings as a promise of things to come- a fitting follow up to \\"Blood Brothers\\". To my mind it is by far the best on the album and rates with Springsteen's best work. <br /> <br />The rest of the album has it's moments. Songs such as \\"The Rising\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" are very strong in their own right, however they don't have the strength to transcend the (very obvious) context in which they were written, and are unlikely to stand the test of time. I don't see this as a problem. An album is intrinsically a product of the times in which it was written, and \\"The Rising\\" is a sincere and uniquely well crafted snapshot of the afermath of one of th defining moments of recent history. There are only a few songs that are anything special in their own right, but the album for what it is, and what it should be, is a masterpiece.
B0008G2IRO|3.0|It's different, but who wouldn't expect it to be considering it has a new line up...however, it is not all that bad. If you liked the first Gorillaz CD you will probably like this.
B000AARKO4|5.0|Spectacular! Marvelous! Bravo! I watched it once-then twice, and I'll be watching it again and again. If you're interested in the Crusades, medieval life, Saladin, battlement, and the history of Jerusalem, you need to buy this DVD. I was greatly impressed with each character. Each one of them brought a special link to the movie to form the perfect chain of characters. Orlando Bloom was fabulous as Balian. Well done.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is probably the best CD I will have bought in 2005. It is amazing.  <br /> <br />I have been an A7X fan for a while, and though this CD is not what I was expected after their first 2, this is a great CD. It has your hard hitting \\"metal\\" but more importantly, you can understand these guys and M. Shadows has an amazing voice. I was disappointed at first because it seems as though A7X has gone soft and \\"main stream\\" but then I gave it a thorough listening to and it is still a great CD. <br /> <br />BUY IT!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Death Cab has been a group favourite between my friends and I for a long time now. It was music that was so sweet to listen to and just easy to dissolve into your skin. In short: we loved it.   However, I for one think that Plans falls very short from their last album. I think this is because none of the songs seem to retain that building swell of music, the bittersweet lyrics, and melting vocals. 'Someday You Will Be Loved' is a big stretch from older songs like 'A Lack Of Color.'   The best songs are Marching Bands of Manhatten [it breaks my heart to hear it], Summer Skin, Different Names For The Same Thing, What Sarah Said and Brothers On A Hotel Bed.   This album by itself is very good. When compared to the older work of Death Cab, it cannot compete. However, if you new to the band, definitely pick up this album. So you can get the feel of the band.  The album is not bad ,just simply as I indicated earlier, not as good as before.
B0002MG9SI|5.0|This is one of those movies that will hold a special place in your heart. I first saw Amelie as a college student with a group of friends. We represented quite a variety of tastes and personalities, and we all left this film with huge, contented smiles on our faces. We also immediately logged on to amazon.com and pre-ordered the dvd. Amelie will remind you of all of the little details that can make life so special. This film is definitely the highlight of my dvd collection. You won't be disappointed!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Gorillaz has produced another breath of fresh air. Demon Days is different to their debut, but it's even better, I dare to say. Every song is unique and fantastic. If you think that Feel Good INC. was good, wait till you hear the rest of the album. My favourites are Kids With Guns, O Green World, DARE and Demon Days. Trust me, for something new and just the right amount of every genre (rap, techno, rock, dancehall etc.) of music, this is your answer!
B000002UAF|5.0|this is it a great album and if there was no Rubbersoul or white album this would be my faviorte Beatle album of all time. The title track and I love her things we said today and I,ll be back are great songs.  Any time at all and can,t buy me love are great as well.  GodBless
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I have this complex where I just can't give this group a five simply because they do not write the lyrics for this album (which, might I add were splendid.) I was first introduced to TATU by a bisexual friend of mine, and being bisexual, of course she owned the album. It's dance music with a twist. No, not the whole lesbian-themes issue, but with actual thoughts behind the words and emotion behind the vocals. I'll admit: boy, those girls can sing. They can hit a note higher than someone getting kicked in the balls, and harder than a nun would hit a naughty schoolgirl (having gone to a convent school myself, I shouldn't say that..but I did, so there.) It's not the conventional techno with just the same two sentences being sung repeatedly. I suppose that if you really are a lesbian and you like techno, you should listen to them. It's..empowering to say the least. I can't think of a better Russian psuedo-homosexual female pop duo CD I own.
B000002UAR|5.0|Over all a great album and my fourth favirote.  Yellowsubmarine, Here there everywhere, she said she said,and Good Day sunshine are terrific.  This is where some drugs come into play and Im just not one four drugs at all.  Tracks like Tommorow never knows, and Dr. Robert are to drug influenced.  godBless
B000000LZV|5.0|True originals, as most of the reviews on here seem to get.  This is their 'famous' record, a double lp seemingly made in response to Husker Du's Zen Arcade.  Both bands would diverge from 'punk rock' and define it by creating their own sound.   <br /> <br />The minutemen were jazz inflected, a 3 part outrage.  Each musician was so unique and seemed to carve their own song into the music.  I am privileged to have seen them and 1-2 years later 'Firehose' without D Boon. <br /> <br />'History lesson' is the story of the minutemen from D Boons eyes.  Such a sad sweet song about loving their band and how their lives have turned out because of punk rock, made heartbreaking by D Boon's death.  He could not have written a more perfect coda to his music and life, if had written this one from beyond the grave. <br /> <br />It is not possible to listen to Storm in my House loud enough, I have tried.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Best of there later period albums and is second in my overall picks of the Beatles.  Im so tired, Martha My Dear, Rocky Racoon, long long,long, are great songs the only songs I dont like is revelution 9 and your Blues bad lyricks.  GodBless
B000000WCX|5.0|I don't usually like or listen to much industrial music, but \\"Outside\\" was a really good CD. \\"Earthling\\" is the same way with me. I don't usually like jungle-dance music, but I still really like \\"Earthling.\\" I'm not just saying that because I'm a big fan of his. He's just got this way of being able to turn something that's generally not so great into something amazing. Hell, I bet Bowie could make a rap CD and it would turn out decent! ...Then again...I don't think even he could save that trash. Now, moving on to \\"Earthling.\\" <br /> <br />A couple of people say that this was his comeback album, but I think Bowie had made his comeback in 1993 with \\"The Buddha of Suburbia.\\" It's a shame they put that out of print. The title track is one of his best songs of all time. Anyway, all the songs on here, except for one, are jungle dance songs. The one that isn't is \\"Seven Years In Tibet.\\" It's industrial and sounds like something that could've been on \\"Outside.\\" All the songs are great, except \\"Looking for Satellites\\" and \\"Telling Lies\\" are a little weaker than the others. But, those two are still very listenable and they don't really hurt the rest of the album at all. My favorites are \\"Battle For Britain,\\" \\"Seven Years In Tibet,\\" \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" and \\"Earthlings on Fire.\\" <br /> <br />I'll admit when I first listened to it, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. But when I listened to it again, I became addicted and now it's one of favorites right along with the rest of his albums. If you're new to David Bowie's music, I'm not really sure which CD to recommend picking up first, because each one sounds totally different. I guess I'd pick Hunky Dory or Aladdin Sane. If you aren't new to him, I highly recommend this. People are selling this CD on here for $0.01, so you wouldn't be out of much if you didn't end up liking it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UAU|3.0|This is not one of my favirote Beatle albums.  Rubber soul, The whit album, A hard days night are.  Two many drugs going on at this time, but songs like Getting Better, A Day in the Life, and the Title track are timeless songs.  GodBless
B00006AVRK|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse is without equal as a British humorist, and these adaptations are without equal on television.<br /><br />Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are unbelievably hilarious as the pleasant, rather thick Bertie Wooster and the unflappable Jeeves. They will forever be Jeeves and Wooster in my imagination as I read the books. The things Hugh Laurie can do with his face are amazing, and Stephen Fry completely perfects the concept of the expressionless expression.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good as well, even though the actors portraying various characters change throughout. I especially love Bertie's aunts, who persist in treating their grown nephew as if he's perpetually ten years old.<br /><br />It's a pity American television so rarely rises to anywhere near the excellence of a series like this. It's well worth purchasing the set and savoring every bit of Jeeves and Wooster one possibly can.

0385486804|5.0|I'm not one to read many books but I can honestly say that I enjoyed reading Into The Wild.  I'm an outdoorsy kind of guy so it made this book more interesting for me.  There are some parts of the book where the auther gets off track and it gets a little boring, but for the most part the book kept me interested. <br />This book is about a young man names Chris McCandless who graduates from college and donates all his money to chartity and takes off on an experience which eventually ends his life.  He was cold hearted and didn't tell any of his family he was taking off.  They had no clue of his whereabouts for two years until his body was found dead in an abandon bus six miles out in the bush north of Mt. McKinley in Fairbanks, Alaska. <br />I wold recommend this book to anybody that likes to read, and especially to those who like the outdoors.  A lot of this book talks about how he survived on the road and about his adventures in the outdoors.  Im not a big reader but this book kept me interested. <br /> <br />

0553801503|5.0|A Feast For Crows is most assuredly not wanting. Some people are confusing their personal favorite characters as the central plot axis. ALL the characters contribute to the plot. It is ludicrous to compare Martin with Jordan. A Feast For Crows has significant plot developments, they just don't fit the mundane fantasy norm, and have a high degree of subtlety and intelligence. Essentially, this book establishes the various religious factions which do not share the same boundaries as the political alliances. This is something not usually depicted in fantasy to any degree of sophistication. <br /> <br />The characters are not the srory, they are a part of the story.  I think some readers have their romantic notions as to who should be doing what.  Martin is not catering to that thought.  He is redefining the archetypes of fantasy to be reflective of historical and contemporary political and human realities. <br /> <br />I too missed some favourite characters.  This did not detract, however, from enjoying the overall story and the complex interplay manifesting from the seeds planted in the first book.  A great read.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is like infinity times better than the last million movies I've seen.  You should definitely quit chatting with babes on the internet and check it out!<br /><br />What happens when you take a cast of unknowns (except for one actor who's biggest other parts were in \\"The Country Bears\\" and playing Jethro in the movie of \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\") and combine them with a script about high school geeks where the entire plot could be described in 3 sentences?<br /><br />Magic happens.<br /><br />Jared Hess and wife Jerusha co-wrote the script and John Heder brings to life  Napoleon Dynamite, an awkward Idaho high-schooler who is sooooo far from cool.  He is tall and gangly, all knees and elbows with an unruly mop of orange hair. Like all teenagers, he has dreams about being more than he is, but poor Napoleon is so far from the mainstream that he doesn't bother dreaming about things your average teenager fantasizes about.  When the other kids dream about going to the major leagues, becoming a movie star or getting into medical school.  Napoleon would be satisfied to have \\"computer hacking skills\\" or \\"numchuck skills\\".  Like a lot of high-school geeks, Napoleon spends a lot of time drawing fantasy pictures, and because he's Napoleon, they're not very good.  Unlike the geeks in, for example, the \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" movies, Napoleon is so clueless he doesn't recognize how far out of the mainstream he is.  At one point he decides to impress a girl by drawing her portrait.  He gives her the pitiful drawing and tells her \\"I spent like three hours doing shading the upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.\\"<br /><br />In the universe of this movie, Napoleon almost fits right in, because his family is dysfunctional in the extreme.  (There's never even a mention of his parents.) Napoleon lives at home with his thrill-seeking grandmother and 30-something loser brother, Kip.  In many ways Kip is more pitiful than Napoleon because he's had an extra dozen years or so to develop into... a guy who spends all his time on the internet \\"chatting with babes\\". (One of the best sequences of the film comes later on when his online girlfriend, LaFawnduh, actually takes a bus out to the middle of nowhere to meet Kip.)<br /><br />The film is populated by other lovable losers like Pedro, a dull boy who imagines that he can get the most popular girl in school to like him if he bakes her a cake. Uncle Rico, another odd family member, comes to babysit Napoleon (and 30 year old Kip) after Grandma is injured in a scene that couldn't have been better if Larry, Curley and Moe had been in it.  Uncle Rico dwells on his high-school football glory, when his team WOULD have won the big game if the coach had only put him in at quarterback.<br /><br />The allure in the film comes from the characters, their situations and especially their language.  You just have to SEE it to get the magic in lines like \\"Hey, Napoleon, what are you gonna do today?\\" \\"Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!\\"<br /><br />This movie is lightning in a bottle.  It's got skills.  Vote for Pedro!a guy who spends all his time on the internet \\"chatting with babes\\".

B000002UB6|4.0|My seventh favirote album from the Fab four is Let it Be.  Let it Be is my favirote song of all the Beatle songs Long and winding road is great and so is one after 909 one of there older numbers which finally got recorded.

155890641X|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of my favorites. The wicked queen makes Snow White do chores almost all the time. The wicked queen wants her huntsman to kill Snow White and to bring back her heart as proof. But, the huntsman tells Snow White to run away and never return to the castle. Snow White runs through the enchanted forest the whole night, imagining things. After Snow White finds a giant group of animals, she asks them where she can stay. Luckily, they lead her to the seven dwarfs' house. The seven dwarfs are diamond miners. Snow White cleans the house while she is there, with the help of the animals. The seven dwarfs at first do not want it clean. They like cobwebs and spiders and dust. The wicked queen, when she finds out the huntsman tricked her, makes a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, as well as a poison apple which she offers to Snow White. The wicked queen tells Snow White that the apple is really a wishing apple, only she made the whole thing up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can the seven dwarfs save Snow White from the wicked queen? You'll really like this animated film. Buy it this minute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000002LOE|5.0|This album sends mixed messages to the listener.  Some tunes are overally happy, some quite depressing. I can only explain it in parts: <br /> <br />Radio Song - the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking.  A guest vocal from KRS-One makes it quite a lively tune.  Puts you in the mood for a more Green-style album. <br /> <br />Losing my Religion - Huh? What's this? The album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled Stipe spills problems out to the listener.  The tortured riff holds out until the end, telling the listener this isn't quite like Green or Document... <br /> <br />Low - The depression lingers on.  Low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low.  My favorite on the album, I think it's delicate and sad.  My #1 downer tune. <br /> <br />Near Wild Heaven - Another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst.  Deals with the apprehension of love. <br /> <br />Endgame - A curious tune.  Can't be interpreted either happy or sad, for it is instrumental.  It could go either way, it's written in a major key, yet the melody sounds sobered, almost as if it's a requiem. <br /> <br />Shiny Happy People - Takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness.  A low point on the album, yet I interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial earlier tracks. <br /> <br />Belong - One track I don't understand, yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album. <br /> <br />Half a World Away - Ah, so beautiful.  Essentially about enjoying life's finer moments at the expense of moments to come.  Truly happy, but still holds on to the softcore angst. <br /> <br />Texarkana - The lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it's about unfulfilled life goals.  Delves deeper into seeds of depression until... <br /> <br />Country Feedback - The climax of saddness on the album.  This song is excruciatingly sad.  The melody, the lyrics... It kept me awake all night.One of the saddest songs I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Me in Honey - A powerful, joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out OK in the end. <br /> <br />This album is highly recomended.  R.E.M. are an incredible band. <br /> <br /> <br />
6304119046|5.0|This was Welles's first film, made when he was only 24 years old.  He had already done some innovative work in radio and on stage, and he came to Hollywood with fresh ideas and boundless energy (he worked on the film something like 16-18 hours a day).  He also had some tremendous collaborators like Gregg Toland and Bernard Herrmann.  The result is a monument of filmmaking--and it was like nothing anyone had seen before.  I don't know if it's the greatest film ever made or even Welles's greatest, but it is certainly the greatest debut ever, and its influence has been felt for decades.  I'd like to see the films that armchair critics of Citizen Kane could make. <br />
0553801503|1.0|I trusted George RR Martin enough to actually plod (and I do mean PLOD) through 400 pages of this book before it really dawned on me that I'd been had.  The blow fell hard and hurt like hell...kind of like suddenly being molested by your most trusted uncle.      The Muse from whose arms he wrote the first 3 magnificent books has obviously left him for another man.  Either that or he decided to pull a Robert Jordan and deliberately rip off his fans to make an extra buck.     481 pages into this mass of boring, trite filler I'd had: ONE short chapter about Jon, 2 about Arya, 2 about Sansa.  NO Dany, Bran, no Onion Knight...  At 481 pages I began to leaf through the next couple hundred pages looking at chapter headings: NO Jon, no Bran, no Dany...      Then I came to this little self-satisfied 'disclaimer' at the end about how he'd 'written too much and had to break it up into 2 books'.  (Oh, and don't forget the almost 80 pages of \\"index\\")    Bull.  This is nothing more than a commercial rip-off, 684 pages of mostly Jordanesque meaninglessness, designed to pick the pocket of loyal fans who were dying to hear the rest of the story (the REAL story).  Who have been waiting anxiously to hear the rest of the story.    Well you won't hear it in \\"A Feast For Crows.\\"  Believe me, wait for the paperback, the HB is a total waste of your good money and your trust in this writer.  If you can't wait to fill your life with boring, meaningless details about Cercei, Brienne and a host of NEW characters whose chapters irrelevantly fill this book, hey, go throw money at it.    After Jordan's 5th book I stopped buying the hardback editions, and after the 6th I stopped paying retail for them at all and waited for the 50 copies to begin showing up at yard sales (they show up fast and in abundance at yard sales, people mine the nugget or two to be had and don't wait to get rid of them).  I can do that with Martin, as well, if I have to.    I've been a major fan since Fevre Dream (and that's a long, LONG time), and George RR Martin kicked me in the teeth (maybe even stabbed me in the heart) when I laid my $25 down for this inconsequential, irrelevant piece of tripe.
0553801503|5.0|From reading the other reviews, I suppose I made a mistake in not reading the other books in this series first, but the title intrigued me and I didn't know it was a series. And I'd heard so much praise for the author, I just had to see what he's doing right!  <br /> <br />Perhaps, as reviewers say, the first books were better (almost masterpieces?), but I still enjoyed this book. The characters were rich and well-developed and the story kept me guessing. All in all, buying this book was money well spent!  <br /> <br />But, by way of comparison, I'll have to back-pedal and get the first ones.  <br /> <br />My hat's off to this author!

Have a good laugh, you may recognise some traits that you share with the protagonist, Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood.    Becky has a split personality. She is a compulsive shopahoic who has no concrete sense of the value of money that has simply gone done the drain with her extravagant shopping habits. Shop on a whim is her motto. On the other hand, she is also laughably (but perhaps not so) a financial journalist for a magazine \\"Successful Saving\\"!! She gives advice to readers on how to utilize their money. To Becky, this is a dreary boring occupation which will come in handy for her future career move.     To cover up her mindless shopping debts, she tells lots of white lies to her bank manager, friends & family. Till it snowballs and things gets out of hand.    Luke Brandon, who desires her is a workaholic obsessed with his successful PR company.    As they say, opposites attract and they both clash in a TV show!!    Go read it!!

0783219695|5.0|It is hard to believe that more than a decade has passed since \\"Apollo 13\\" was released in theaters. It is a powerful film. There are many reviews on this site that discuss the details of the film, the quality of the presentation in this DVD, and the special features included. As an historian of spaceflight I want to consider in my comments the importance of the \\"Apollo 13\\" film as a statement of nostalgia for the experience of Apollo and the time that it evokes.<br /><br />Set in 1970 when an explosion crippled a lunar landing mission and NASA nearly lost astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert, it has been recast as one of NASA's finest hours, a successful failure. At 56 hours into the flight an oxygen tank in the Apollo service module ruptured and damaged several of the power, electrical, and life support systems. People throughout the world watched and waited and hoped as NASA personnel on the ground and the crew worked to find a way safely home. It was a close-run thing, but the crew returned safely on April 17, 1970.  It may have been the space agency's finest hour; certainly it was its most heroic.<br /><br />The near disaster served several important purposes for the civil space program--especially prompting reconsideration of the propriety of the whole effort while also solidifying in the popular mind NASA's collective genius. While one must give the NASA flight team high marks for perseverance, dedication, and an unshakable belief that they could bring the crew home safely, it is quite strange that no one seems to realize that the mission failed at the time of accident. The fact that Apollo 13 is now viewed as one of NASA's shining moments says much about the ability of humanity to recast historical events into meaningful morality plays.<br /><br />In this instance, Apollo 13 became a vehicle for criticism of the social order that emerged from the 1960s and a celebration of an earlier age. When the film appeared in 1995, reviewer John Powers, writing for the \\"Washington Post,\\" commented on its incessant nostalgia for \\"the paradisiacal America invoked by Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan--an America where men were men, women were subservient, and people of color kept out of the way.\\" In addition, Powers wrote, \\"Its story line could be a Republican parable about 1995 America: A marvelous vessel loses its power and speeds toward extinction, until it's saved by a team of heroic white men\\" (John Powers, \\"The Wrong Stuff,\\" Washington Post, July 9, 1995). If anything, Powers underemphasized the white America evoked in \\"Apollo 13.\\" The only women with speaking parts of substance was Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlin), wife of the Apollo 13 commander, whose role is distinctly one of offering proud support while privately fearing the worst, and their daughter whose role seems to be as spokesperson for the social revolution underway while consistently reflecting its least important elements. For example, she complains in a shriekish voice that the Beatles just broken up and her world has accordingly collapsed.<br /><br />The heroes of \\"Apollo 13\\" are the geeks of Mission Control, with the astronauts aboard the spacecraft as spirited but essentially and metaphorically emasculated characters to be saved. Lovell, Haise, and Swigert must wait to be rescued in a manner not unlike Rapunzel, as an active helper but unable to accomplish the task alone. As historian Tom D. Crouch wrote of this film's depiction of the \\"studs\\" in Mission Control: \\"The real heroes of this film are either bald or sporting brush cuts; wear thick glasses; are partial to rumpled short sleeve shirts; and chain-smoke an endless string of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. For all of that, these slide rule-wielding technonerds solve all of the difficult problems required to bring the crew home. They are, in the words of one of the astronauts portrayed in the film, \\"steely-eyed missile men\\" (Tom D. Crouch, \\"Review of Apollo 13,\\" Journal of American History 84(December 1997): 1181).<br /><br />\\"Apollo 13\\" the film, accordingly, venerates a long past era in American history. Indeed, it may have been an era already gone by the time of the actual mission in 1970. At the same time it is a powerful story of courage and diligence that remains one of the best films to appear in the last ten years.tory 84 (December 1997): 1181).  <br /> <br />\\"Apollo 13\\" the film, accordingly, venerates a long past era in American history.

0553801503|5.0|First, an important piece of information to remember about this book is that it does not contain a number of the major point of view characters from earlier novels: Jon Snow, Daenaerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Davos Seaworth; these characters will feature in the next novel, _A Dance with Dragons_. Readers opening this book with the hopes of reading about these characters directly will be disappointed, but there's no real reason to be disappointed as this novel is a success. <br /> <br />Focusing as it does on events south of the Neck (particularly King's Landing and the Riverlands) and some interludes in the east (that firecracker, Arya Stark, has a few chapters), the novel is thematically the tale of what happens when the centre cannot hold and everything seems to fall into a malignant, ugly chaos. Those trying to hold the pieces together-such as Jaime Lannister-are faced with the crows who descend on this rotten feast, not least among them being the scheming and vindictive Cersei. It's like a car wreck in slow motion -- you want to look away, but you can't. If the previous books were about the lead up to and then the outbreak of war, this is the book about the aftermath, the nasty little bickerings that make the peace look almost as bad as the war and all the while you realize that greater dangers loom which this \\"feast for crows\\" will leave the realm ill-prepared for. <br /> <br />The chapters link together in a more subtle way than previous books, as actions and decisions in King's Landing start to have a slow and noticeable effect on the surrounding landscape. Characters are caught up in a tide of events which threatens to sweep them away. Indeed, by the end of the novel, it's almost impossible to guess where the sixth book of the series will go: that much happens to set the realm topsy-turvy.  <br /> <br />Are there flaws? Certainly, it's the rare book that doesn't have some. Some more work could have been to heighten linkages between certain chaptersmight be the primary flaw, because while they are there, they're more subtle than readers might be used to. <br /> <br />To finish up, it seems that the important question is, \\"Is the book worthy of its predecessors?\\" And the answer is an emphatic, \\"Yes!\\"

B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is so good.  I've been listening to it almost everyday since MAY!  Mariah's vocals are unbelievable.  I still shake my head when she hits those notes.  The lyrics are very good, too.  You can play the entire CD all the way through and get a great mix of dance tunes, ballads and mid-tempo songs.  I have never seen her in concert, but I'd pay to see her now because of this album.
B000BH4YFE|5.0|T. Rex and Marc Bolan had the U.K. wrapped around their fingers from 1971 to 1973 as \\"Trextasy\\" was at its height. In 1971 the band released the seminal \\"Electric Warrior\\", which launched the band into stardom. Surprisingly, they raised the bar (and then some) once more with \\"The Slider\\". <br /> <br />Featuring two U.K. number one hit singles, -- the effervescent \\"Metal Guru\\" and the bluesy pop of \\"Telegram Sam -- \\"The Slider\\" is the band's best produced album and arguably the most accessible. The strings give the songs -- with their rough glam guitar -- more ground and a more lush setting, that pairs nicely with Bolan's earthly poetic lyrics. The title track is an esspecially great groove-filled song with an odd use of vocals as an instrument (other than singing). <br /> <br />The rough glam tracks like \\"Buick Mackane\\", \\"Chariot Choogle\\", and \\"Baby Boomerang\\" work well with slower ballads like \\"Main Man\\", \\"Mystic Lady\\", and the simplistic acoustic sound of \\"Spaceball Ricochet\\". The lyrical content still uses the same whimsical storytelling from his previous work, which is certainly a good thing. And the background vocals are used much in the same way as on \\"Electric Warrior\\", sometimes gratuitously, but usually effectively.  <br /> <br />The remastering is done excellently, very much like the other re-releases done for the T. Rex catalogue. The crafty production of Tony Visconti (who was at his best at the time) and the mixing highlights the skill of Mickey Finn and Bolan's playing nicely. The bonus disc is a good treat as well, giving an alternative take of each track on the album, which are usually demos or acoustic sessions. <br /> <br />This album helps prove that Marc Bolan was one of the truly great prolific songwriters of his day, despite his steady decline in the mid-70's and his eventual tragic death. Thankfully, the songs still hold up today, showing the strength of his words and music.
0375704027|3.0|A sense of frustration came over me as I got into Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood, and the sense both is and is not the novel's fault.  I came into this novel after an obsession with Murakami's short stories, particularly the later collection After The Quake, a book whose contained ruminations on mortality, chance, loose threads, and personal awakenings were as haunting as novels ten times their lengths.  Norwegian Wood came first, but in dealing with those themes on a grander scale, I must admit they were substantially less interesting - the airy metaphysics that gripped me before segued into characters whose motivations were blank or oblique here, and led to contrived interactions.  Yet looking into my complaints on this novel, I find too that they come from a lack of cultural context - apparently it WAS fashionable in late 1960's Japan for plaintive, overly analytical women to check themselves into designer depression insitutes; apparently you COULD find women willing to ask you to masturbate to the thought of them and not blink an eye at it.  I found those developments a sort of upper crust ennui that said, to me, very little about life, as well as finding the story's central love triangle to be enervating when it wasn't ridiculous.  Still, I can't deny the story's mystical drive that evoked the thought and atmosphere of late 60's existentialism, its erotic backbone, and its anxious compassion.  I don't find Norwegian Wood to DO quite as much as the other Murakami works I've read - short and long - and in that, I think it's skippable.  But there's no doubt that, at least by the end, I rooted for Toru's happiness and wondered where his life would take him.  Which is to say, the elements didn't leave Murakami altogether.
0553573403|5.0|Not much I can say about this beyond what has already been said. It's book 1 of a long series, and while most of the storylines aren't resolved in this book, it's well worth the read. I look forward to the rest of the series.
B00005JO1G|2.0|I was extremely offended by this movie from the moment it began until the moment it ended. In reality, I should have left. I will admit that some of the acting was intense and rather believable and this is the ONLY reason I rated it a '2'. If you have any morals, than this movie will be of no interest to you: <br />1. extreme profanity (over 100 uses of the 'f' word) <br />2. perverted slag (referring to women and men in a degrating manner- talking about a \\"field f---\\" where men sexually exploit one another) <br />3. sexual content (2 sex scenes- both graphic and disturbing; two assumed teenagers having 'rough' sex against a wall and the other a soldier's wife and her neighbor having sex on her couch-from behind) <br />4. masturbation- a common topic and an actual scene SHOWING and HEARING the actual process <br />5. death/suicide- shows an attempt to kill another soldier then himself <br />6. anti-war- shows Desert Shield/Storm as pointless and contributed to nothing but heartache/pain/depression <br /> <br />I was very offended and found this movie to be unrealistic in the message in potrays about our soldiers. Do not go see this movie nor buy it.

0553801503|5.0|Wow, I am suprised by all the negative reviews I am seeing here.  <br />And I'm especially surprised with the bile and meaningless tripe I have read in them.  <br /> <br />People criticize the book and say Martin has \\"pulled a Jordan\\" (what an idiotic phrase) when it is obvious that they haven't read the book and have little to no patience to finish it.  A reviewer called \\"dcozens\\" stated that there were few nods to Jaime.  HELLO!! Jaime has at least 5 or 6 chapters in the bloody book.  His chapters are among the most fascinating because they focus on a person who has fallen from grace and is now struggling to regain his honor.   <br /> <br />And don't get me started on the negative reviews of the audio version. Those I discount offhand.  People who don't have the time or patience to READ a well crafted epic should never be allowed to give reviews.  (or base poor reviews of a book on a different voice actor) <br /> <br />All that being said, out of the four books published so far, this is the weakest.  But don't read too negatively into that criticism.  My fourth favorite Beatle's song is still pretty damn awesome! One needs to take into account that Martin is the peak epic fantasy writer of today.  The weakest book in the song of Ice and Fire series is still an amazing story, and 10 times better than all the drivel that is being put out by the publishers today.   <br /> <br />As usual, I found Martin's prose fluid and amazing, the backstory on different characters and moments in history fascinating, and the pace was as compelling as any thriller. This is pretty much par for the course for him.  He can take as much damn time as he wants to write the next one, provided that he delivers the same high quality as he as with what he has written so far.   Has he provided the goods for this book?  Yes. <br /> <br />Was it perfect?  No.  Of course I wished that we'd have Dany, Jon, Bran and Tyrion in there.  Jon and Bran are my favorite characters.  Tyrion is Martin's favorite.  Do you think he'd want to delay writing about him? But I'd rather wait for them than have Martin try to force them into the story in a way that didn't work.   <br /> <br />The story itself stands.  The interesting developments in Dorne and the Iron Islands provide nice breaks between the intrigue and corruption brought about by Cersei.  Jaime is compelling.  I once wrote a letter to Martin that stated \\"that you could make me feel sympathy for Jamie Lannister is f*@-ing brilliant.\\"   <br /> <br />I can't wait to see what happens next.  And for all you naysayers out there...grow up.
B000001GQY|5.0|These readings are legendary. I searched and searched for a good set, first trying Zimerman/Bernstein (horrid recording quality, saggy accompaniment) then trying some older recordings (Katchen/Ferencik, Kovacevich/Davis, Rubinstein/Ormandy), then even a different version by the same performer (Gilels/Reiner/CSO) and finally going to an old favorite of mine on the keyboard (Pollini/Abbado). In all cases, I was not really a fan of a) either the ensembles' un-Brahmsian (in my opinion) accompaniment or b) the soloists' interpretations or execution. However, these recordings, when I first bought them in the old DG Galleria release, were a revelation. Gilels' playing can best be described as monumental, and Jochum's direction is Brahmsian to the core. Jochum, who always excelled in music of this level of grandeur (listen to his Bruckner!), constructs a firm yet supple orchestral line which perfectly complements Gilels, who is by turns elemental and serene. These are magical performances, and the result is a rarity in that both concertos are amongst the greatest ever readings of the works (especially for #2; only Fleisher/Szell, Backhaus/Bohm and Anda/Fricsay come close - #1 has serious competition from Fleisher/Szell and Curzon/Szell). For the sake of comparison, in #2, the Fleisher and Backhaus sound rushed next to this performance, particularly the Fleisher; and while the Anda reading is much closer in terms of overall approach - ultra-legato - Anda stumbles occassionally during some of the most fiendish passages where Gilels does not. In Concerto #1, I'm a bit divided, as both the expansive performance on this disc and Szell's quick, incisive and direct accompaniment work equally well.   I suppose I should also mention that the Fantasias, op. 116, are masterfully interpreted here and are the best I've heard, far above and beyond Kempff, Katchen or Lupu. It's a great filler, although it would be insulting to call them that. A pity Gilels didn't live long enough to record Opp. 117-119. One final minor annoyance: I don't understand what happened to the Ballades Op. 10, which used to be included in the old Galleria release.  As for the sound: with the new DG Originals transfer, the sound finally matches the performances; gone are the whiny strings and the somewhat hollow sound from the original transfer, and in its place we have a recording that sounds almost brand new, with great clarity in the brass, piano, and orchestral forces. The liner notes are a little weak, which I've noticed on a lot of these \\"Originals\\" releases.   With all that being said: If you must only have one recording of these two concertos, then this is the one to get. Truly desert island stuff.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|Comparisons of Tim Burton's \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" with the previous film version of Roald Dahl's classic starring Gene Wilder, \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" may be unfair (or not), but the comparisons certainly are inevitable.  The two most obvious contrasts between the two films are that between Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willie Wonka and Wilder's version 35 years earlier, and the general warmth and charm of Willie Wonka and the characters in general.<br /><br />An unquestionably talented actor who has evocatively played some truly breakthrough rolls, like Edward Scissorhands, for example, Johnny Depp either nails a character or does not.  In \\"Charlie...,\\" unfortunately, Depp misses big.  Depp creates in a new Willie Wonka a spooky, air-headed, heartless and ignorant Willie Wonka.  The audience wonders, \\"How could this intellectual and emotional lightweight have ever created the worlds most prolific chocolate empire?\\"  There were no such concerns with Wilder's Willie Wonka, who, although occasionally abrupt and Darwinistic, the audience knew always had a heart of gold.<br /><br />Like Depp, Tim Burton's films are either a dead-on winner, like the first new \\"Batman\\" movie starring Michael Keaton, \\"Ed Wood,\\" and \\"Corpse Bride,\\" the latter ironically two both also starred Depp, or a miserable loser like the 2001 version of \\"The Planet of the Apes\\" and \\"Mars Attacks.\\"  There is not much in between.  \\"Charlie...\\" is a loser.  By creating a world using smart special effects that is dark and oppressive and characters who are the product of that world, Burton gives the movie-goer (and DVD buyer) very little to feel good about.  Even the Oompa Loompas, who were fun, sage, and entertaining in the 1971 film were in fact sort of mean, chiding, and uninteresting.  (I use the word \\"were,\\" referring to the new Oompa Loompas in the plural.  In fact, Burton \\"cheated\\" by digitally reproducing the same actor, Deep Roy, hundreds of times to represent the diminutive factory workers.)<br /><br />The only bright spot in \\"Charlie...\\" was the casting of Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's mother.  Her role is small and mostly insignificant, but Carter has the ability through her extraordinary talent as an actor to make just about every one of her roles amusing.  However, that bright spot does not shine long, as the other actors, from Freddie Highmore's Charlie, to David Kelly's Grampa Joe, to Noah Taylor's Mr. Bucket, to all of the actors who played the children, to Deep Roy who portrayed the Oompa Loompa(s), turn in performances as disappointing as the film itself.  For the most part, it's not the actors who were at fault.<br /><br />While \\"Charlie...\\" does in many ways parallel Roald Dahl's book more closely than \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" did three and a half decades ago, the new film fails to capture the poignant moral lessons in the same context as the book did.  It also fails to leave the audience with the same warm happy feeling that the original film did.  In short, unless you are a HUGE fan of Tim Burton or Johnny Depp, don't bother with this poorly constructed facsimile.iminutive factory workers.) <br /> <br />The only bright spot in \\"Charlie...\\" was the casting of Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's mother.

B000001GQP|5.0|This is a top-notch rendition, a performance approved by Orff himself, who was present during its recording. The cleanup of the sound in this transfer is incredible - the recording sounds much more recent than 1968. Fischer-Dieskau and Janowitz are phenomenal in their solo sections, and the Berlin Deutsche Opera Orchestra is electric. The chorus is equally powerful when needed, and properly muted in the softer/slower sections. The pace is the fastest of any recording I have heard, and it toes the line between restraint and unbridled power perfectly. For years I preferred the Ormandy/Philadelphia/Rutgers performance, but this reading is truly legendary. For those looking for a definitive interpretation, this is it. Forget about Levine and everyone else, and listen to the work as Orff intended.

0596007124|5.0|Head First Design Patterns teaches design patterns in a wonderful way. The examples are very good and make apropriate us of the Java language. This is a book which is a little more difficult to digest than Head Firts Java because Design Patterns are conceptual and thus are not language features. Still Sierra and Bates do an excellent job of illustrating key points through engaging examples. This is not the most thorough book on design patterns and would rather qualify as a beginner patterns book, yet the material is covered with such a high quality that it deserves 5 stars. <br /> <br />If you are interested in more advanced patterns book in Java you can look at Allen Holub's excellent book \\"Holub on Patterns\\". If on the other hand, you do not mind switching languages \\"The design patterns Smalltalk companion\\" is another great book on the subject. <br /> <br />
B000AARKOO|4.0|This is a good movie.  Its flop at the box-office may have more to do with contemporary theatre economics than production values and storyline.  The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets and music are outstanding.  It is a different angle on the crusades. No, it's not pro Muslim, although it does provide useful glimpses of their viewpoint.  It's not particularly pro Christian, either; it shows that all Christians were not of one mind when it came to ruling the holy city.  The leaders of both armies, espcially Saladin, come across as decent men dealing with a complicated situation.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I thought this movie was very interesting. I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the acting, I didn't think it was that bad. Others claimed it showed some Christians as too fanatical, I somewhat agree with them however remember this is not a documentary. I think the intended message behind this was you will find fanactics or idiots everywhere, however you will also find good people as well. There were many historical inaccuracies, however I enjoyed the movie as a movie. If you go to see this movie watch it as a movie not as a documentary.
B00009V7P8|4.0|Probably one of the freshest voices I have heard in the last two years. Went to Sine in New York thinking I would be seeing Damien Rice but it turned out to be another Irish singer/songwriter with the same first name. If you are given to melancholy you will undoubtedly play \\"Delicate\\" on repeat for the first couple of weeks if not months. The delight is in \\"Canonball\\"; for the second time in my life I wish I had penned the lyrics to another artist's song. There is an eloquence in verses of \\"Canonball\\" that I believe speak to the cumulative effect of experiences with the passage of time. Well worth a listen!
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this jazzy, swinging, upbeat xmas album from Diana. This is what I wished \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" had been. If she had sung on that album as she does here she could have put some life into those dead-ass songs.<br /><br />I don't get it when someone says she is singing off-key and uses strange phrasing. I can only submit that some people listen to Diana because it is supposed to be cool and then think they know something about jazz. Her phrasing and singing here is impeccable and top notch. Totally in the Diana style. So I don't see where the surprise is. I haven't heard Diana sing like this in several albums. It is a pleasant return, believe me. Of the xmas albums I presently own this is definately one of the finest.<br /><br />Also some people need to loosen those wedgies in their pants over the pictures of Diana. People have gotten so uptight in this country. I think the pictures are fine. From Diana's third album on, sex has been one of several points in selling her to the public, and I for one love it, as my several posters of her hanging on my wall will attest to. She is talented, and yes, darnit, good looking and sexy! She must be STOPPED! Please.<br /><br />Anyway, stop picking things to cry about and deal with it. In the end it's all about her music. Her gorgeous looks is just an added bonus. Above all that she is classy. She's done nothing to discredit herself in any way shape or form.<br /><br />So if you want a very good, solid album of jazzy xmas songs perfectly meshed with her band and orchestra, this will surely not disappoint. Unless you're a complainer, that is. It's xmas music! Lighten up. Enjoy it. The alternatives are breaking out your kids chipmunk xmas albums. Maybe that may be more some peoples speed.<br /><br />Bravo, Diana. You recorded a winner in my book. Stay cool and sexy! And Merry Christmas to you!
B0002BO0AS|2.0|This band is pretty much a joke, ive seen them live and all they do is dance around and tell the crowd to do the same. Not only this but hteyre music is not that great, you'd be much better of getting Killswitch Engage if your a fan of this kind of metalcore
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I was really looking forward to getting this cd as I was so disappointed with Diana Krall's last album, Girl in the Other Room.  I was hoping that this would be more in the jazz vain.   It is definately an improvement, however, I felt that the slower songs were very draggy and sometimes it seems like she is trying  TOO HARD to swing. The orchestra is fantastic and of course her piano playing, what little there is, is fantastic.  I DO like her phrasing on some songs and dont like it on others.  All in all it's okay, but im glad I didnt pay full price!! I think there is  too much hype and not enough to back it up.
0553801503|5.0|This book wasn't perfect, but for Martin, sub-par is still a five star book.  I ordered from England to get it as quickly as I could, and I wasn't disappointed.  Some of the POV chapters weren't as interesting as others (Brienne comes to mind), but they are still well written and keep your attention.  The Arya chapters are the best, and the book is built on the Jaime and Cersei chapters, which are also outstanding.  Kept me on the edge of my seat, and I think the next book will be even better: It should have more Arya, and lots of Tyrion and Dany.
B00005JO1S|3.0|This was a space odyssey game for astronomers as most of the action takes place out there in space among the planets, stars, meteor showers, and black holes.  Two squabbling brothers go on a space adventure, courtesy of Zathura, an old-fashioned board game.  It is one of those \\"be careful what you wish for\\" moral stories and shows that, sometimes, small is better. <br /> <br />Danny, the younger brother, is never satisfied and is forever needing attention.  These children (an older sister is on board) are the products of a broken home, and it shows in their mis-behavior and discontent with the hand fate dealt them.  Walter is the most maladjusted as he foolishly blames the youngster for the parents' breakup. <br /> <br />As the house floats around in space, reminiscent to Dorothy's house there in the tornado which lands in Oz, they run into a destructive, defective robot, some metal lizard men, and goats with multiple eyes.  All misfits.  As the astronaut teaches them, there are some games you simply cannot play alone, and that once started you must finish this game.  This is 'a move forward to the future,' as the past is relived, and the moral of the story is to appreciate what you have and value those you love.  Walter is prevented from making the wrong 'wish.'   <br /> <br />Even though the family home is completely destroyed out in space, it is magically restored after the robot is reprogrammed, the astronaut from the future eats a 'dagwood' sandwich, and the harried dad returns from his urgent errand to hand them over to their mother for a four-day week. <br /> <br />This might be a little too scary (even with the gerbil) for smaller children, but pre-teens should have a good time with the subliminal experiences and violence all adolescents feel when frustrated with uncaring parents and authority figures.  \\"Jumanji\\" director, Jon Favreau, did wonders with Chris Van Allsburg's fantasy game come to fulfillment, better than his original jungle adventure.
B00097DXZS|4.0|I enjoyed this CD.  Yes, I like old Santana too, but I also enjoy listening to different artists collaborating together to make music.  Santana's guitar and the band are indeed present and I don't see them as a backdrop to the guest singers on the CD.  I don't know why people are criticizing the singers because I think they all do a fine job.  The songs provide an array of different sounds to enjoy.  I've listened to it over and over and find myself liking the CD even more.  <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed Trinity, Los Lonely Boys, Stephen Tyler, Joss Stone, Anthony Hamilton and Bo Bice.    <br /> <br />I like Santana enough to enjoy him alone or working with other artists.  Keep making beautiful music, Carlos!!
6304936362|5.0|I saw this film several years ago, when it was initially released. I liked <br />it very much, and was very touching for me, because of the human feelings <br />it was able to show. I have always thought of this film as the perfect Air <br />War counterpart to that marvelous Submarine War film \\"Das Boot\\". In both <br />films you can feel the human suffering of human beings in terrible war conditions. <br />There are many excellent war movies, but regarding Air Force fighters, this <br />one is undoubtedly, at least for me, the best one. <br />One more point which was very touching for me is the last bombing target: <br />the seaport of Bremen. My great grandfather was born in Bremen, and I know <br />the city quite well. I can notice within the Old City any place where a <br />bomb fell. Nonetheless, it is not my point. It was wartime, and we must <br />understand it. But near the end of the film, the crew decided not to launch <br />some bombs, because there were clouds, and if they failed, intead of destroying <br />a factory they might have destroyed a nearby school, killing innocent children. <br />The crew took the risk to turn once again around the objective, to launch <br />the bombs exactly on the correct target, with all the danger envolved for <br />them. It was a moment of great emotion for me.  <br />
0064471837|4.0|...but it was a little off.<br /><br />But hey, what can i say? It was brilliant!<br /><br />I started reading this book because a friend of mine said it was really good. I doybted it, but i gave it a try. And for once in her life, she was right.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? Well, because, though it was good, it did have a few flaws. Like the fact that it was very confusing. The gates and precincts. Since I've read all the books, I get it, but in the first book, it was all a blur. Right now, i can't think of any others, but give me an hour, and there's boung to be more.<br /><br />  But a great book, nonetheless. Read it. You'll love it!
0140177396|5.0|Short, but marvelous. That's Of Mice and Men in three words, but that nutshell does extreme injustice to the true wonder of this classic.<br /><br />Through this tale, John Steinbeck was able to say so much, in so little words. Never before have I seen so many themes bonded so seemlessly together, without being boring and flat. No, Of Mice and Men was enjoyable, and I would never mind reading it again. I will never forget Of Mice and Men, for it has found its own special place in my heart, and forever there it will remain.
B00005ASHM|3.0|in my humble music-illiterate opinion of course 'sgt. pepper' and 'pet sounds' are interesting but they're also not 'equally' as good. i've listened to many pop albums going back to the fifties and there are a whole bunch of them that i prefer to the aforementioned because the music's more appealing as i sip my beer (i think some lsd would probably help those to get through 'pepper' and 'sounds' more than once). and the folks who decry that 'pet sounds' is the best album? go to the zoo, take out a recording device and make a record - you folks will love it i'm sure...signed, still stuck on good MUSIC  p.s. brian wilson is a great talent that much i'm sure of (in my opinion)
0553801503|5.0|I'll start out by saying that this book is different than its predecessors, and as many other reviews complain of, there are many new POVs and often few links between their storylines.  Although the style was very different than the first 3, it's difficult to compare it to them.  A Feast for Crows reminded me of a short story collection in some ways, which I think was the intention because of the way Martin named the chapters involving the new characters: \\"The Prophet, The Soiled Knight\\" etc. instead of just \\"Aerion, Arys...\\"     That being said, I loved it, and not despite the new style but because of it.  Many of the new characters are just as intriguing as recurring characters; I especially enjoyed the chapters involving the Greyjoys, all of whom are way more interesting than Theon ever was.  While each new character has their own introductory story, their chapters are linked through the events in the Iron Islands which are going to have a lasting impact in the series.  That goes for the Dornish chapters as well.    As for the recurring characters, it's true that the book is slow at some points (Brienne's first couple chapters mostly, and Sansa's), but it was still just as immersive as the first three.  Other reviewers complain that many chapters are unnecessary and the story doesn't advance, but I think they miss the point: while there aren't as many huge political twists and betrayals, the real movement is happening in the people of Westeros and the characters.  I especially found this true for Jaime and Sam, who are now two of my favorites.  Also, the book starts to set up what appears to be a coming religious conflict, which is more subtle than the simple king v. king politics which were set up in Game of Thrones.  If you know where to look, Feast shows just as much promise as Thrones did for the future of the series.    When I finished this book I was disappointed, but it was only because I wanted more.  A Feast for Crows is a more than worthy entry in the series.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I always hated male models. I would really hate Derreck Zoolander if he was real but fortunately he isn't; he's a wonderful character portrayed by Ben Stiller. <br /> <br />The movie is full of funny bits and lines you will repeat to your friends or may even have heard before. 'Orange Mocha Frappacino!', 'Have I been taking crzy pills?' and 'Moisture is the essence of wetness' are not so funny now but they will be when you hear them. <br /> <br />Ben Stiller plays a part he ususally doesn't, as a stupid male model. Owen Wilson is his usual smug great and Will Ferrell probably plays his best role apart from Ron Burgondy in Anchorman here.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Will I spend more than five minutes in a review of a film that stands on my memory zone in the neo-cortex less than that after it is finished? Ok, maybe three minutes.<br /><br />On the last decades of the nineteenth century, a new science called anthropology produced all kind of (ethnographic) descriptions of faraway people in faraway places, so different from the white explorer-scientist and his mother-society.  The sense of superiority inherent in this kind of enterprise constitutes a big part of what makes backpacking appealing (back then and to this day).  With this film you have the opportunity to feel that there are some places on this Earth were you can stand in awe simply because you're there.<br /><br />The plot is extremelly silly but never insulting, and the cinematography is extraordinary.  Some interesting directorial touches of Disney's ex-CEO son (sorry mate, you need to do some movies before getting people to remember your first name) makes this light summer film very worth of a rental (assuming you have a 5.1 surround setup).  It is a shame that the best shot of the film is the opening credits one (you'll understand when you see it), but the rest of the film has enough gloss to put your mind in a kind of popcorn trance.  Finally, I appreciate that the CGI is really kept at bay and that most of the action seems to be filmed on location with real stunt-doubles.<br /><br />By the way: this was filmed in Morocco, but you know that, you stayed until the end of the film credits to know where to next time you get your backpack out of the closet, isn't?
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is the U2's most musically complex masterpiece. <br /> <br />No silly massive radio hits are presented here, rather, this is their most powerful album. This is the concept of contradiction, such a brilliant one. One can't describe where this beauty comes from. The lyrics and music are both unique, but it maybe the paicular things about this album, which make it gorgeous to the ear <br /> <br />Truly remarkable and unique. Simply unparalleled. If you do not have this album, you are missing out on one of the greatest works ever heard. <br /> <br />
B000002UTY|5.0|Like many in this forum, this album takes me back to times that were more meaningful and enjoyable, at least to us.  But it is the re-listening in this day and age that convinces me that this has to be one of the greatest albums of all time, bar none.  This is such the antithesis of all the three minute formula-driven junk that is passed off as \\"oldies\\".  The entire album is spotless and darn near perfect, but it is Calvary that consistently amazes.  To a QMS fan there is not much I can say that would add much, but to anyone who has never heard this album, you are in for quite an experience.  I have a copy at each player in my house and another in the car.  The best is a road trip on a beautiful fall day.  Just imagine where QMS might have traveled to, music wise, had they stayed together.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Sufjan Stevens, an independent artist that releases his albums under his own label, has been around in the industry for quite a while. Name an instrument from the top of your head and he'll be the one playing it.<br /><br />When I first heard this album, which was my first Sufjan CD, I was flabbergasted. I had never heard anything like him. It blew my guts right out, but tranquilized me at the same time. I got hooked on the album and before I knew it I went to one of his concerts. Overall I listen to harder rock, but I have to say this concert is one of the highlights of my concert-tripping.<br /><br />The music is overall quite calm, but the whole album sounds so pure, Kurt Cobain would roll over in his grave. The instruments on the album vary from banjo, flute, acoustic and electric guitars to violin and piano. In a straight contrast to his previous CD, Seven Swans, Stevens has really packed out this time.<br /><br />He experiments with style, melody and also rhythm. In the song \\"Come on! Feel The Illinoise!\\" I heard a 7/8 rhythm and it sounds perfect.<br /><br />His songwriting is original and colourful. He writes about typical Illinois trademarks, such as Abraham Lincoln, Seer's Tower and the prairies. His style reminds me of being a young child, being introduced to so many things that you'd never seen before it's nearly incomprehendible. Yet, he attempts bravely to understand and write about it and express his thoughts with a soothing breathy voice.<br /><br />A graded and commented tracklist (In my opinion):<br /><br />1. Concerning The UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois: (8/10) An earmelting piano and flute intro that gets you sucked into the album straight away.<br /><br />2. The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You're Gonna Have To Leave Now, Or, 'I Have Fought The Big Knives And Will Continue To Fight...: (6.5/10) An ridiculously long title for a song I prefer to skip, mainly because of the annoying fiddles in the beginning.<br /><br />3. Come On! Feel The Illinoise!: Part I: The World's Columbian Exposition/Part II: Carl Sandburg Visits Me In A Dream : (8/10) You just have to love the 7/8 rhythm pattern and the cheery melody.<br /><br />4. John Wayne Gacy, Jr.: (9/10) One of the most disturbing songs on the CD. He compares himself with a serial killer, accompanied by an acoustic guitar and a piano. Cold chills guaranteed.<br /><br />5. Jacksonville: (7.5/10) A slow choir song about life in Jacksonville, nothing amazing, just pleasant.<br /><br />6. A Short Reprise For Mary Todd, Who Went Insane, But For Very Good Reasons: (8/10) Experimental all the way, the first thing that comes to mind is a short break in between the silent violence. Which is well needed...<br /><br />7. Decatur, Or, Round Of Applause For Your Stepmother!: (8.5/10) A banjo-themed trip through the woods of good old Decatur, while thinking about your stepmom and how you loath her. A very pleasurable experience, indeed.<br /><br />8. One Last 'Whoo-Hoo!' For The Pullman: (6/10) Another sketch-like break, featuring clapping and a quiet \\"Whoo-hoo\\". I don't really know what to think of it...<br /><br />9. Chicago: (9/10) Another great anthem on the CD, a tribute to the windy city. Float past the Seer's tower and follow Sufjan and his friend in the truck off to New York, because \\"all things go\\"...<br /><br />10. Casimir Pulaski Day: (8.5/10) Quite a sad song about a friend of Sufjan's dying of bone cancer and all the event and memories around this person. A simple tear-jerker, especially the mind-blowing trumpet solo.<br /><br />11. To The Workers Of The Rock River Valley Region, I Have An Idea Concerning Your Predicament: (7/10) A phaser-guitar and a piano recover you from the previous track.<br /><br />12. The Man Of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts: (8.5/10) This is as loud as it gets on the CD, guys, a mildly overdriven guitar. A slow-mo theme for Superman, an ode to the Man of the Metropolis.<br /><br />13. Prairie Fire That Wanders About: (7.5/10) A sort of spacy song about the Illinois prairies. Good pentatonics!<br /><br />14. A Conjunction Of Drones Simulating The Way In Which Sufjan Stevens Has An Existential Crisis In The Great Godfrey Maze: (5/10) Wow, listen to those instruments fading out...!?<br /><br />15. The Predatory Wasp Of The Palisades Is Out To Get Us!: (9.5/10) Amazing song about a youth experience of Sufjan's, about a giant insect that attacked him and his friends. This song stunned me when I saw Sufjan playing it live. Great instruments, vocals, everything.<br /><br />16. They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!: (6.5/10) Random song about zombies... Don't like the instrument combination in this song...<br /><br />17. Let's Hear That String Part Again, Because I Don't Think They Heard It All The Way Out In Bushnell: (7.5/10) Sentimental violin-piece in between. Sounds alright to me.<br /><br />18. In This Temple As In The Hearts Of Man For Whom He Saved The Earth: (6/10) Another short sequence, sounds like a church quoir chanting. Kind of odd, but there's a good fade from the previous song to this.<br /><br />19. The Seer's Tower: (8/10) Piano/organ song, and vocals that rush past the tower as wind would. The chorus seems annoying at first, but recovers quickly.<br /><br />20. The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders: Part I: The Great Frontier/Part II: Come To Me Only With Playthings Now: (7.5/10) A cheery song with a good piano riff and effective back-up vocals.<br /><br />21. Riffs And Variations On A Single Note For Jelly Roll, Earl Hines, Louis Armstrong, Baby Dodds, And The King Of Swing, To Name A Few: (7.5/10) A single note trumpet takes us to the final song in a short break.<br /><br />22. Out Of Egypt, Into The Great Laugh Of Mankind, And I Shake The Dirt From My Sandals As I Run: (7.5/10) A fitting song to end the CD with, a calm soothing track that gives you a mild slap in the face to recover from Sufjan's dreamy world of Illinois.-mo theme for Superman, an ode to the Man of the Metropolis. <br /> <br />13. Prairie Fire That Wanders About: (7.5/10) A sort of spacy song about the Illinois prairies. Good pentatonics! <br /> <br />14. A Conjunction Of Drones Simulating The Way In Which Sufjan Stevens Has An Existential Crisis In The Great Godfrey Maze: (5/10) Wow, listen to those instruments fading out...!? <br /> <br />15.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Martina has a body that Keira only wishes she could have.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Ryan Adams is an engaging singer, an adequate lyricist and an obscenely talented crafter and arranger of music. The Cardinals are an excellent backing band. When they hit on all four of those cylinders (\\"Let It Ride\\", \\"When Will You Come Back Home\\",\\"Meadowlake Street\\") the results are just wonderful. Overall the sound continues Adams' return to the alt.country of Whiskeytown from his early, poppier solo stuff. This is where Adams belongs in my opinion, writing music perfectly suited to his vaguely yearning lyrics and mournful voice. Which is not to say it's a perfect record. The Grateful Dead references sound suspiciously, almost commercially, tacked-on. Adams may like the Dead, but their inclusion seems more the product of artistic ego than creative voice. Also, the record's a bit long and samey; it would have been better with a couple of the less affecting ballads cut out. Still, it's the best thing he's done in a few years.
B00005JOMY|3.0|\\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" is the latest offering from former wunderkind Shane Black. Black made a splash as a screenwriter, breaking his own records for money paid for a screenplay for \\"Lethal Weapon\\", \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" and \\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\\". Then he disappeared. In \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\", Black reteams with his former producer Joel Silver, and directs his own screenplay, a homage (or some might say a parody) of Film Noir.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.), a petty thief on the run from the cops, stumbles into the middle of an audition in Manhattan. The producers are so impressed that they fly him to Hollywood to do a second audition. In Los Angeles, the producer's pair him with \\"Gay\\" Perry (Val Kilmer), a private investigator who acts as a consultant on their films, for training. They are considering Harry for the role of a cop. Before you have time to say the title of the film, Harry and Perry are involved in a twisted story of murdered young women, crooked businessmen and Hollywood gone bad.<br /><br />I'm all for clever films. You know, the type that make you think and try to figure things out. The best mysteries let you in on a little of the secret and allow you to figure it out as you go along. All of the clues should be there; it's just a matter of figuring out how they all fit. Maybe on the second viewing, you understand how they fit and you appreciate the film for including everything.<br /><br />\\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" is a different kind of clever. It is the type of clever a film writer or director wants to be to prove how good they are, how witty, how funny. \\"Kiss\\" has some funny lines, but the writer and director are so intent on making us `laugh' and so intent on proving how `witty' they are, that the film suffers. For most films, the director might tone down the writer's excess, or vice versa. In the case of \\"Kiss\\", the writer and director are one in the same, so there is no sounding board to say \\"Hey, this is excessive. Let's fix it.\\"<br /><br />From the first frame, Harry's narration brings attention to the fact that we are watching a film, about an actor, in Hollywood. Harry, the narrator, frequently breaks the fourth wall (\\"Let's take a look at how I got to \\"the party\\") and addresses the audience directly. Yes, this is funny, to a point, because it serves to call attention to some of the conventions of the genre. At one point, Harry says something like \\"Don't you hate it when a film shows a shot of a mental institution and it ends up being a big part of the plot? Oh, look. A mental institution!\\" But it gets real old, real quick. Because Harry and his high school sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) both read a series of pulp James Bond-like detective novels growing up, chapter titles are frequently superimposed over the frame. They contain titles like \\"Chapter 2: The Lady in the Lake\\" paying homage to the dime store novel and Mickey Spillane at the same time. These two elements frequently mention various things about Hollywood, including terms like \\"Best Boy\\" and others. Who, outside of Los Angeles and New York, knows what these terms mean? Who cares?<br /><br />This \\"wink, wink, nudge, nudge\\" look at Hollywood overlaps a mystery. Remember what I said about clever films and mysteries that actually have everything there? \\"Kiss\\" is not interested in being a clever mystery. It wants to be a clever film about Hollywood. The mystery element is secondary, merely serving as the framework for the Black's attempts at Hollywood parody. Too many of the elements are revealed ala \\"Scooby Doo\\", either Harold or Perry stop the other person and start reciting how or why something happened. Yet, we never see actually see the action or the clues. In the end, the mystery is extremely convoluted and makes little sense.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. certainly works very hard to make Harold seem like a real human. In some scenes, he actually takes a breath and tries to hold the gaze of Harmony or to talk toPerry as a normal human being. In others, his arms are flailing about and he is running around in circles resembling one of the Marx Brothers on crack. Kilmer seems to be trying to channel the spirit of Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, as he tries to make \\"Gay\\" Perry seem funny.  At one point, Harold and Perry are both being held captive. Perry begins baiting the guard by calling him a closet homosexual, etc. Perry reaches into his pants. \\"You want some of this, I know you do.\\" This continues for what seems years until Perry shoots him with the small gun he keeps in his underwear. \\"Homophobes never check there.\\" Are you laughing yet? Neither was I.<br /><br />In order for a parody or homage to work successfully, the filmmakers need to make the base material believable. In \\"Kiss\\", the mystery doesn't work, which detracts from the funny jibes at Hollywood and the Film Noir genre.<br /><br />\\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" has some funny lines and references, but you will have to wade through a lot of insider jokes and a poorly constructed mystery to get to them. Personally, I think it's a waste of time. Check out \\"The Big Picture\\" or even Alan Alda's \\"Sweet Liberty\\" for a better, funnier look at the excess of Hollywood.r to talk to Perry as a normal human being.

B00081U7HC|3.0|For anyone who simply wants to know if this is the original theatrical version, like myself--it's not.  It's the same as the 10th Anniversary Edition, with the stuff from the cutting room floor thrown back into the movie, instead of in Bonus Features where it belongs.  I'm so thankful I still have the oringinal release that I love on video.
0307276902|5.0|...Ever found yourself asking this of people with intense drink or drug problems? Ever desperately tried to understand how someone who seemingly has so much would want to wrecklessly destroy everything, including themselves?<br /><br /> I don't think I have ever read a book which so aptly depicts the internal mecahnisms and derangements of addiction.<br /><br /> You won't always like Frey or his thinking, but isn't that partly the point? If we find him distasteful, repellent and hopelessly self involved surely that offers some insight into his own world and view of self? Lost as he is in his addiction.<br /><br /> He captures the mind shifting, self fulfilling nature of the internal disarray and lack of care for the normal life, or is it utter disconnection from normal life?<br /><br /> Compelling, bewitchingly interesting and cautionary, the stream of conscious/subconscious, fixed thinking, hypnotic style of prose is at once engaging and unnervingly mind shifting.<br /><br /> Should become the ultimate aversion therapy or recovery read of our time, needs work and comittment but worth the journey.<br /><br /> A kind of 2000's \\"on the road\\".

B0002OERI0|3.0|If you want to hear rebelliion there are groups doing something a lot more interesting than pop punk anthems.  You also have groups like Skinny Puppy with their Greater Wrong of the Right album.  Something completely different and pretty darn original if you ask me.  American Idiot is basically doing the same thing most Green Day albums do with no real evolution in their sound.  Therefore, all you're left with is an album that's getting successful based more on a rebellious attitude toward the administration without much in the way of taking music in new directions.  Yeah, there are some ok pop songs on here but I'd rather hear a message as well as something that hasn't been done before.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Once upon a time I was truly repulsed by this album.  If I listened to it on the headphones, even at a reasonable volume, I would get a headache.  The fast parts were a confusing blur, the slower parts were dreary downers, and everything in between was just weird.  The vocals sounded like cheap black metal ( a genre that brings out the cheesiest elements of heavy metal and then some) imitations, which made me send the album straight to the used record store. <br />However, I couldn't ignore the tremendous amount of hype around Converge and this album from people with respectable taste in music.  There were two things I could have done; stubbornly insist that I could see through the hype around Converge or open up my mind a little more and give them a second chance.  I chose to take the second option and I'm glad I did.  I finally discovered the truth about Converge's masterpiece \\"Jane Doe.\\" <br /> <br />It begins with a brief sound off of the guitar before they lay into a blistering section of grindcore called \\"Concubine\\" that is much like being sucker punched in your temple.  For the second track they slow the tempo, but ratchet up the dynamics and intensity which makes for a perfect flow so far.  Then, on \\"Distance and Meaning\\" they settle into a type of groove with interludes of whistling feedback that brings to mind the golden age of hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag type stuff) only a bit more complex. Finally, they slow to a crawl with sadistic, harsh, and noisy little number called \\"Hell to Pay\\" that signifies the first breaking point of this psychotic episode. <br />Bam!  Time to break out of it with the strike and rise guitars and vocals of \\"Homewrecker\\" which is oddly catchy.  The fight to rise continues with a renewed level of rage that continues to build throughout the course of \\"The Broken Vow.\\"  \\"Bitter and Then Some\\" continues on the same note only becoming more reckless and chaotic at the highest speeds since the first track.  At this point the ragebegins to twist and bend into demented plane of being during\\"Heaven in Her Arms.\\" <br />You've arrived at the second breaking point as everything once again slows to a crawl and there is a sort of beauty churning out of this sludgy, feedback laced track that indicates there may be no turning back.  With just the drums and vocals, Converge then unleashes one of the most vicious attacks on the album with an almost psychedelic, yet enraged piece called \\"Phoenix in Flames.\\"  By the time \\"Thaw\\" arrives, the emotions are overloaded in terms of heaviness and intensity, yet Converge continue to drive it home with chaotic insanity. <br />The final breaking point arrives.  The bleak ending.  No turning back.  When people talk about Jacob Bannon's vocals becoming ethereal and beautiful on \\"Jane Doe,\\" they are speaking of the title track.  It's an eerie, chilling ending to an album that has been a dizzy array of emotion.   <br /> <br />\\"Jane Doe\\" is completely original for whatever genre you would like to put this in.  If it's a metal or metalcore album, then it's not anything like the many Gothenburg bands and their clones who have merely stolen Judas Priest and Iron Maiden riffs and made them faster and harder.  No, Converge is much more creative then all those bands put together. <br />If it's just a hardcore record, then it may be too complex and experimental to be grouped in with that general scene.  The guitar sound may be closer to hardcore, yet they play riffs that are closer to metal. <br />So, throw out all your preconceived notions about what metal or hardcore should sound like and listen to \\"Jane Doe\\" very, very closely.  The rules they break are part of the charm of this record, but they are not merely breaking rules to break them.  Every note played has a place and reason on the record and it all fits together perfectly.
0553801503|5.0|First of the voice of the reader has nothing to do with the book, if that is such a big deal maybe you should learn to read.  Second off the book was good, Not his best work but it was a great book.  It was lacking all my favorate people but still I enjoyed it.  We all knew before we bought the book what we were getting.  He told us our favorate people were not in it.  This is a bridge book and they are never as good as the first or second half.  There are some interesting plot twists, Cersei thinks she is so smug but everything blows up in her face.  We we start to find out why the Price of Dorne is holding back.  So lets give Martin a break, if you are a loyal fan you will.  We all know he does not deserve a 1 give him a fair rating. <br /> <br /> <br />Thanks

B0006VIE4C|5.0|A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a daydreaming farm boy named Luke Skywalker on the desert planet of Tatooine discovers a secret message in the memory banks of a small astromech droid called R2-D2. The tenacious little robot leads the young farmer and his golden protocol droid, C-3PO, to the home of a mysterious hermit who holds the secrets of Luke's past...and future. The hermit's name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he is a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan explains to Luke that he once fought alongside the boy's father, a long dead Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, that Anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former Jedi named Darth Vader, and that his hope was for Luke to carry on in the Jedi ways. Obi-Wan teaches Luke about the Force, an all-encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the Jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities, from levitation to precognition, to incomparable speed and reflexes. The old Jedi also passes on to Luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the Jedi weapon, a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease. Together, the aged Jedi, his new apprentice, and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within R2-D2; a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan asking Obi-Wan Kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet, for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil Emperor's greatest weapon, the Death Star.     Hiring a seedy Corellian pilot named Han Solo and his copilot, Chewbacca the Wookie, to fly them to Alderaan in the starship freighter the Millennium Falcon, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper-speed, doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil Empire along the way. They shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lion's den, however, when their search for the now non-existent Alderaan lands them in the heart of the Death Star itself,a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast! Together, the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission, saving the beautiful Princess Leia from the Emperor's vile henchman, Darth Vader, but not without first losing one of their own in the escape. It is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within R2 is safely delivered to the rebel alliance, and that the Death Star is finally destroyed!    In 1977, young filmmaker George Lucas changed the lives of countless young movie-goers by delivering unto them \\"Star Wars,\\" a swashbuckling, sprawling space saga of rebellion, romance, and sorcery, in the style of the 1930s serials that inspired it, but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before! Starring newcomers Mark Hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as dashing, fortune-seeking flyboy Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as beautiful damsel in distress Princess Leia, along with the unforgettable voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader and screen legend  Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, \\"Star Wars\\" spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way, relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable John Williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself. Drawing inspiration from the annals of film history, borrowing heavily from \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" tales of King Arthur, and the works of Akira Kurosawa, not to mention the history of mankind in general, George Lucas's seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism, even in its most unbelievable moments, that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure. That's just what \\"Star Wars\\" is, an adventure; a thrill ride for the young at heart!    After its initial release, it was revealed that \\"Star Wars\\" was merely one chapterin a 6 part saga. To be more specific, the film first known as \\"Star Wars\\" was, in fact, \\"Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope.\\" This led to two sequels that brought the story together as a legendary film trilogy beloved by millions of fans who buy up \\"Star Wars\\" merchandise greedily to this day! In 1997, \\"The Star Wars Trilogy\\" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the \\"Star Wars Saga\\" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"     With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or \\"classic\\" Star Wars Trilogy came even more \\"improvements\\" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. The most noticeable, in this reviewer's opinion anyway (all those complaints about the Greedo scene seem overblown to me, and I'm a huge Han fan), is the scene where Han Solo converses with Jabba the Hutt. First restored to the film with a digital Jabba in 1997, the DVD release offers a NEW Jabba in this scene; one that looks considerably more like the Jabba the Hutt we are all familiar with. While the new CGI Jabba still doesn't seem quite as harmonious with the rest ofthe picture as such digital characters do in the prequels, the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned, especially with the much needed update. Though, it kinda makes my action figure of 1997 Jabba pretty pointless. In general, aside from the digital removal of one of my favorite characters, Lak Sivrak (AKA the cantina wolf-man, another of my action figures that has been made obsolete!), I have no problem with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all). Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. \\"A New Hope\\" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, if you want the other great extras, you'll have to get the whole trilogy set, but don't get your hopes up. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking the deleted scenes of Luke and his friends on Tatooine, the 1997 Jabba scene (hey, it'd be nice for historical purposes), the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with, AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring. At least those awesome teaser trailers are included on the bonus disc. Anyway, back to the subject at hand, \\"Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope:\\" Still one of the best films ever made, still the same powerful experience (despite alterations), and still my favorite version of Leia! You can keep your gold bondage bikinis! Gimme young, glossy-lipped, cinnamon bun-headed princess perfection!
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is perhaps the most brilliant thing Metallica, or any band, could ever think of. Sell-outs? No way! They added another dimension in their versatile canon by adding the brilliant, and sadly the late, Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Symphony to enrich the classic catalog of Metallica songs.  <br /> <br />From the first song on the first CD entitled \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" by Ennio Morricone from \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" is THE perfect intro to the entire album. Though it lasts only 2:30, it's enough to make the album a keeper. I really don't know which song is my favorite. \\"One\\", \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"Until It Sleeps\\", \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", \\"Fuel\\", \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", and \\"Master of Puppets\\" stand out especially. But every song works with the orchestra.  <br /> <br />Metallica still plays extremely well, especially with Hetfield adding a couple new, and profane, lyrics to some songs and introducing two new songs \\"No Leaf Clover\\" and \\"- Human\\", as well as inviting the audience to sing along. You literally find yourself laughing at Het's good cheer and the crowd's response.  <br /> <br />My only gripe is that no songs from Kill 'Em All are covered, and they neglected to use \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"Welcome Home Sanitarium\\", two of which would have benefitted from the redux. But in all, it's a great album!  <br /> <br />Buy it, listen to it, love it!  <br />
B00062RCBW|5.0|In 1987, following the success of four big screen films that resurrected the short-lived 1966-1969 sci-fi television show called \\"Star Trek\\", writer/producer Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) created an entirely new version of the \\"Star Trek\\" television show set approximately 100 years after the time period of the original TV series and big-screen films.  Entitled \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", the new TV series premiered in 1987 and was broadcast for seven years.  Though Mr. Roddenberry did not live to see how successful his new TV series became, or the other \\"Star Trek\\" TV series and big-screen films that were produced later as a result, his legacy continues to inspire new generations that are drawn to the optimistic future that he envisioned. <br /> <br />For his new starship Enterprise, Gene Roddenberry created an entirely new cast of characters to be the ship's crew: Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lieutenant Worf (Michael Dorn), Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner).  During the show's first season, there was an additional main character, Lieutenant Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), but she chose to leave the show to pursue a career in film that did not exactly materialize.  Following the show's first season, there was some concern that Dr. Crusher was not a popular character, so she was replaced in the second season by Dr. Kate Pulaski (Diana Muldaur, who had appeared as a guest star in an episode of the original \\"Star Trek\\" TV series in 1968).  However, fans of the show were so upset by the replacement of Dr. Crusher, producers brought her back in the third season and Dr. Pulaski was never heard from again.  A wonderful regularly recurring character was that of Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who ran the ship's bar located in \\"Ten Forward\\"; but one recurring character became an essential plot element in the show's premiere, final episode and several key episodes in between: the alien known only as \\"Q\\" (John de Lancie).  Another wonderful recurring character was Deanna Troi's mother Lwaxana, played by none-other-than Gene Roddenberry's widow, Majel Barrett. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" did marginally well with ratings during its first two seasons, but the show's popularity began to rise significantly during its third season, especially with the final third season cliff-hanger episode \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part 1\\".  In this very exciting episode, the Federation comes under attack from a deadly & powerful cybernetic race known as \\"the Borg\\", who were introduced to the crew of the Enterprise thanks to \\"Q\\" during the second-season episode entitled \\"Q Who?\\" In fact, it was the Borg that had destroyed Guinan's home world many years earlier; so she knew all too well their power and tenacity.  Fans had to anxiously wait during the summer of 1990 to see the episode \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part 2\\" at the beginning of the fourth season to find out what would happen. After these pivotal episodes, \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" never had to worry again about its ratings. <br /> <br />Of the many episodes that were aired during the show's seven seasons, the episodes that I think stand out as being the best would have to include the following: <br /> <br />Season 1: <br /> <br />1 & 2. \\"Encounter at Farpoint, Parts 1 & 2\\". <br />17. \\"Home Soil\\" <br /> <br />Season 2: <br /> <br />1. \\"The Child\\" <br />9. \\"The Measure of a Man\\" <br />15. \\"Pen Pals\\" <br />16. \\"Q Who?\\" <br /> <br />Season 3: <br /> <br />2. \\"The Ensigns of Command\\" <br />4. \\"Who Watches the Watchers?\\" <br />5. \\"The Bonding\\" <br />13. \\"Dj Q\\" <br />15. \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" <br />16. \\"The Offspring\\" <br />23. \\"Sarek\\" <br />26. \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part 1\\" <br /> <br />Season 4: <br /> <br />1. \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part 2\\" <br />2. \\"Family\\"<br />14. \\"Clues\\" <br />22. \\"Half a Life\\" <br />26. \\"Redemption, Part 1\\" <br /> <br />Season 5: <br /> <br />1. \\"Redemption, Part 2\\" <br />4. \\"Silicon Avatar\\" <br />7 & 8. \\"Unification, Parts 1 & 2\\" <br />13. \\"The Masterpiece Society\\" <br />16. \\"Ethics\\" <br />17. \\"The Outcast\\" <br />18. \\"Cause and Effect\\" <br />19. \\"The First Duty\\" <br />20. \\"Cost of Living\\" <br />21. \\"The Perfect Mate\\" <br />23. \\"I, Borg\\" <br />25. \\"The Inner Light\\" <br />26. \\"Time's Arrow, Part 1\\" <br /> <br />Season 6: <br /> <br />1. \\"Time's Arrow, Part 2\\" <br />9. \\"The Quality of Life\\" <br />10 & 11. \\"Chain of Command, Parts 1 & 2\\" <br />15. \\"Tapestry\\" <br />22. \\"suspicions\\" <br />25. \\"Timescape\\" <br />26. \\"Descent, Part 1\\" <br /> <br />Season 7: <br /> <br />1. \\"Descent, Part 2\\" <br />7. \\"Dark Page\\" <br />13. \\"Homeward\\" <br />16. \\"Thine Own Self\\" <br />25 & 26. \\"All Good Things, Parts 1 & 2\\" <br /> <br />Overall, I rate all seven seasons of the phenomenal sci-fi TV series \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Many thanks go to Gene Roddenberry, as well as to the many actors, directors, producers and everyone else who brought Gene Roddenberry's vision to life.
0385421982|3.0|I would appreciate it that, if you know me personally, you do not mention in conversation that you know I read a John Grisham novel. His text is garbage, his scenes are blockheaded, his characters are muddled and really, \\"The Firm\\" is the best thing he did because he maintained such a sense of corporate terror that it was all too realistic for most of us. This book fails at the same kind of suspense, in part because he gets too literal in having his characters evade a conspiracy that is not made concrete enough, visually, for the average reader. I like the environmental awareness he sneaks into the middle of this book, however, sauntering up to us like a surly drunk and pointing out the obvious, then asking if we want to fight over it. Trust me when I say we don't; he knows what he's talking about, even if most of this book could anesthesize us. The characters are cartoonish, the prose as always inefficient and tedious, and the mystery is thin. If you read it, read it for the pelicans.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I am a long time Santana fan and have many of their albums/cd's including Santana's most recent duet cd's.  But - since I am best advised not to let this purposely virus infected piece of optical media anywhere near any of my computers, I don't see why I should purchase it.  And I will not!  I have plenty of other music to listen to.  If Santana wants to sell cd's - he needs to migrate to a label that actually wants customers.  Nice going, Sony.
0393324818|4.0|Moneyball is an excellent non-fiction book that weaves the story of SABERMETRICS, Billy Bean's Oakland A's, and the revolution in baseball statistics (driven in part by the internet and personal computer) into an interesting story.  This book will appeal to baseball fans, amateur mathematicians, lay economists, and anyone fascinated by finding new ways to look at old things.     Mr. Lewis is a superb storyteller.  This book reads extremely quickly and is written in such a way that non-baseball fans can understand and enjoy.    One of the important themes in this book is how do you know what to measure?  Mr. Lewis would, perhaps, express it differently. He might ask how one actually calculates the value of something.  Conversely, this reader couldn't help but wonder if Billy Bean still didn't get it wrong.  Maybe the purpose of a professional baseball team is to make a profit, not to win games. If true, perhaps Mr. Bean is continuing to measure the wrong things.     Another theme in this book is how difficult it is for organizations to take advice from those that are perceived as outsiders.  While the geeky people who invented SABERMETRICS, play fantasy baseball, and enjoy calculating volumes of obscure and obtuse statistics are hardly the public image of professional baseball, they are probably its strongest constituency. Despite this, the clubhouse mentality kept baseball isolated from these ideas for quite awhile.    Additionally, this is a story of reason and strategy triumphing over emotion and belief.  While this reader hopes that there is still room in the world for the supernatural and non-rational, there is substantially less room in baseball for those things.     For all the reasons above non-baseball fans will enjoy this story.  However, this is, and remains, a baseball story.  Nor is the reader required to actually calculate any of the statistics. If you've ever wondered how some teams do well without all the high-priced talent, this book will tell you some of those answers.    My only complaint about this book is that it is so focused on baseball that it is difficult find two or three simple rules that could be applied to other forms of operational analysis.    Ultimately, this is a book about baseball that both tells a good story and opens questions about thinking about the larger world.
0684803356|5.0|A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|One of the things that seems to have been missed with people's reviews is the Fact that on the Rear it's listed as being 4x3 FS. But, it always was & IS in fact 16x9 anamorphic. <br /> <br />How can the Packaging be so wrong ? I'm in Australia & even the Region 4 packaging is listed the same. So, I'm guessing whoever was responsible for the Artwork ( Which is the same worldwide )Got it wrong. <br /> <br />I Hope this is something people want to know - Having watched it on Digital TV, I knew it was filmed in Widescreen. <br /> <br />Other Reviewers have mentioned How great the sound & picture Quality is, so I don't need to enhance their reviews.
0307276902|5.0|Absolutely gripping.  Whether you have used, known someone that has, or simply wish to understand addiction--you must read this book. The brutal honesty with which James tells his story is so overwhelming--you feel every word that is written.  It has helped me to understand better the nature of addiction and the road back to recovery.  Thank you, James. Thank you.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|Sometimes I'm ashamed to admit that during my teens and early 20s I enjoyed synth-pop.  I've moved on, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying this collection of greatest hits by one of the more talented and original groups from the 80s and 90s.  It brought back a lot of memories and reminded me why I enjoyed the Eurythmics so much.  Morover, the songs stand the test of time -- unlike many song from the era.  They are all, every one of them, fantastic.  Annie Lennox has never been as good than when she was with Dave Stewart. They were one of the great duos of that last twenty years and this compilation only proves that.
B00000HZFH|5.0|i know everyone is entitled to their opinions, but i find it hard to believe that someone could love this album and not like \\"broken chairs.\\"  please let me know how that can happen, because i'm baffled.  the song is so ridiculously epic that it hurts. <br /> <br />and the rest of the songs are just as hard not to like.  i remember downloading some built to spill a while back, listening to it once, and then promptly letting it gather cobwebs in the depth of my hard drive for months.  then one day, for no reason at all, i bought perfect from now on (an equally excellent record) and had my mind blown.  how the hell could i have sat on built to spill for so long without doing anything?  they, along with my morning jacket, are my two favorite bands, no question about it. <br /> <br />p.s. \\"broken chairs\\" is definitely NOT a cover
0553804367|4.0|This book tackles the difficult task of trying to synthesize all that is known about physics into something that can be read on the beach.  While it does this surprisingly well (at the expense of any in-depth discussions of any of the topics), there was an error in something very minor that tainted my ability to appreciate the book overall -- because in the back of my mind I kept thinking if something so minor was incorrect, what about the major statements? <br /> <br />The problem?  While discussing time travel, the book credits Steven Spielberg with the movie \\"Back to the Future\\", which was in fact directed by Robert Zemeckis.  While Spielberg was indeed the executive producer for the movie, this would be the same as referring to \\"The Godfather\\" as being a film by Ruddy (instead of Francis Ford Coppola), or more ironically thinking of Spielbergs' \\"Jaws\\" as being done by Zanuck and Brown. <br /> <br />And in writing this review, I used the index to look up the Spielberg reference in the book -- and the index points to the wrong page.  I guess this points up the fact that no matter the caliber of the author, good editors are still in short supply...
B000003N8R|5.0|Others have written, what seems to be everything there is to write and say about this album and the music of John Coltrane.

B0006399FS|4.0|U2 reviewers tend to go wrong when they define a particular album or group of albums as the \\"real\\" or \\"best\\" U2.  For 25 years now, U2 have been on an undending and various journey making music together, and though you may not like the latest installment as much as \\"War\\" or \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Pop\\" (or whatever the \\"greatest\\" is for you), How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is another essential landmark on the way. <br /> <br />What many U2 fans and detractors alike fail to recognize is that, at each stage of the journey, U2 has been calculated and deliberate in making their albums.  As Bono said in the recent Rolling Stone interview, \\"We don't go after albums like rock bands. We go after albums like film directors: this is the subject, let's get into it.\\"  In that sense, every U2 album is very conceptual.  U2 albums are \\"visionary\\" in that they seek out, create, and provide ways of seeing the world, of being in the world.  <br /> <br />In other words, the music is written in service of particular themes/ideas/subjects. And these themes naturally change over time. In the late 80's, the music was in service of the idea of America (the \\"two Americas\\" as the Joshua Tree was almost called).  Hence the huge, sparse soundscapes and the wonderful collision of hope/despair (innocence & experience) on both personal and politcal levels in the lyrics.  In the early 90's the band looked to Europe for inspiration (the frenetic energy surrounding the collapse of the Iron Curtain) and also inward toward the heavenly heights and hellish depths of desire.  Hence the experimental noise and purple-black (ultraviolet) tones.  The rest of the nineties saw experimentation and a flirtation with dance and electronica as a broadening of the \\"palatte\\" of what U2 could be, mean, and sound like, and as an exploration of the themes of identity and spiritual quest in a brave, new postmodern world.  <br /> <br />The latest two albums represent another shift in the U2 sound.  And like all the others over an impressively long career, it is a very deliberate one.  After far-flung musical exploration (with Zooropa, Pop, and especially Passengers) they made a conscious effort to rediscover what is most essential to this band as a band.  Thematically, the resulting album focused on very elemental necessities: friendship, fatherhood, faith, hope, love, and grace.  Far from being trite or trivial, that album captures a hardwon sense of \\"second naivete,\\" and it's no wonder that the raw emotion of \\"All that YOu Can't Leave Behind\\" became a touchstone for many in America after 9/11.   <br /> <br />\\"Dismantle\\" is another record in that vein, though it differs significantly from ATYCLB.  Musically, with this album, U2 draws on its full palatte.  As we might say about a writer or a visual artist, U2 has achieved artistic maturity.  No longer seeking and stretching to realize their talent, they are now at the full height of their powers as composers and performers (and anyone who's seen the Vertigo tour has to agree the band has never played better than they are right now).   Thematically, this album is very \\"adult.\\"  A paen to long-term monogamy, songs exploring parent-child relationships after an elderly father's death, the admission that \\"I've had enough of romantic love...I'd give it up for a miracle drug,\\" the desire to hold onto youthful passsion while also channeling it into deliberate and systematic attempts to heal some of the world's great ills....none of this is very \\"rock and roll.\\"  U2, on their very first album, explored themes of innocence and adulthood.  They do the same here, but from a very different vantage point, much further along the road of life's journey.  At the end of the day, what U2 is doing on this album is making rock music by grown-ups for grown-ups that doesn't suck.  That, in my book, is groudbreaking in itself.   <br /> <br />This may not be your favorite U2 period, and there are fans that prefer the early 80's, fans that prefer the late 80's,fans that prefer the 90's, and yes, fans that prefer the recent stuff.  But don't let your own prejudice about what you think is \\"the real U2\\" blind you from appreciating the breathtaking reach of this band, and the particular greatness of their latest achievement.
0553801503|4.0|I have been reading too many negative reviews and I feel compelled to offer a different point of view. I loved A Feast for Crows, finished it in one night, and give Martin enormous credit for the book.  <br /> <br />Admittedly, the events in this story are not as earth-shaking as some of those in the previous three. But this is the aftermath of the war, its theme is the children of war are left to pick up the pieces left behind by the greats, and the tone and pacing suit the book well. Despite the apparent lack of great events, an enormous amount happens in this book, albeit in a subtler manner. There is a lot of character development in the book, we see Jaime and Sam adapting to their situations, we see Cersei's abilities and weaknesses come out as she rules the court. We see the realm sorting itself out after the war of the five kings. We see the stage being set for the peasants to enter the story as a force for the first time. We are introduced to new players who take the place of the fallen. As for the \\"side characters,\\" the rather brief episodes in Dorne and the Iron islands, they serve to move the storyline along so Martin's series does not in fact turn into the Wheel of Time.  <br /> <br />I think this book, and presumably a Dance with Dragons as well, serve to set the stage for the finale that will be books 6 and 7. A Feast for Crows is an excellent novel and every bit as good as the three before it, and definitely worth buying. Enjoy it!
B000BB1MI2|3.0|this film would have been even better had there been some Editing of a few things here&there.I enjoy the many elements&Direction of the film.Johnny Depp does a good job. there is a Michael Jackson influence here in the sense of a Successful Man  doing his thing, just as with Edward Scissorhand had as well.but this film bogs down with the Music parts where the singing parts kick in.still a interesting film nevertheless.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|Film purists and hardcore fans were probably apalled that anyone would even think of re-making Willy Wonka. Well, to be perfectly honest, they didn't re-make Willy Wonka. They made Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. I am a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, but was open to see this one because of who was behind it. Tim Burton and company didn't re-do Gene or anything else. This is more of the story that Roald Dahl wrote. It is no secret that Dahl himself wasn't really happy about the original film. It was different. For those of you out there who have not read the book, this may come as a shock. A shock that this fancy new version that they may deem as an \\"insult\\" to the original is actually closer to the actual story. This is why this is not so much a re-make, as much as a new try at the actual story that Dahl wrote. The Indian prince, Wonka crash landing at the Bucket residence, both parents being there, and other things, were all in the book. Not in Wilder's version. Burton is a perfect fit for this movie, and he whisks us away into another gorgeous looking world. The film still manages to evoke the fond memories of the original, and it has that Burton feel of whimsical fantasy like \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" and \\"Big Fish\\". There is no denying that the movie looks great. The story, as if you didn't already know it and no need to go through it again, puts more emphasis on the Wonka character and his background. The storyline about Wonka's father is new and added on to the movie. It is interesting. How many of you have wondered where this man came from?. Johnny Depp is incredible. He looks funky and speaks in weird tones, but you can't take your eyes off of him. He is quite amazing, and pulls off whatever it is he is trying to do. This is not Wilder's Wonka. This is a whole new conception. The set design and effects are wondrous. No matter how a Burton movie turns out, you know it will look great and be a visionary treat. This one is no exception. Young Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie Bucket. He is a wonderful little young actor, and really brings young Charlie to life. Deep Roy plays all of the Oompa Loompas. That's right. Every single one of them is the same guy. His part is where the only music comes in. This is not a musical in the way the original was. And that's for the best. The other kids are all wonderfully pulled together, and they don't stray too far at all from the original portrayals. One thing I think is missing is the humor. Don't get me wrong, there is hummor here and I chuckled a few times, but it's not the humor like in the original. The original was kind of black, but it's missing here. Bummer. The movie also has a narration, which the original did not. The new narration adds that whimsical fairy tale quality to it. I believe it is Christopher Lee doing the narration. He also pops up in the film as Wonka's never before seen father. \\"Charlie\\" is not the greatest thing ever made, but it is a feast for the eyes and for the kids in all of us. I doubt it will take over from the original, but it is well done in it's own right. I didn't find it to be scary at all. Others say it was too scary for kids, or that their kids were scared. I don't see it. I had three kids, all under 7, watch it and were totally enraptured. Burton continues to be a genius, and Depp his muse. I look forward to further pairings. These guys are just magic.
B000BGR0OM|4.0|this is probably the best overall collection of the Eurythmics on a whole.Album wise to me.Annie&Dave truly had a tight vibe when working together that never quite worked when they parted.Dave did some decent solo stuff&Annie's first solo Album was tight,but after that it was downhill.there 80's Synth Pop was on point for the time period.the new tracks are cool as well.
B00022XOAO|5.0|Listeners raised on Bruno Walter's classic 1959 Columbia Symphony recording of Beethoven's PASTORALE Symphony will possibly not like Carlos Kleiber's 1983 live recording of this work with the Bavarian State Orchestra.  Kleiber (1930-2004) takes fast tempos and seems to drive the orchestra hard in places.  Those who are fans of Bohm/Vienna (DG); Walter/Columbia (Sony); Bernstein/Vienna (DG); Klemperer/Philharmonia (EMI) may find Kleiber driven and too literal to be enjoyed.  But I did find something refreshing in Kleiber's breezy freshness, with faster than usual tempos in I, III and V which create a feeling of high spirits.  Kleiber plays this work in just 39 minutes, about 3 minutes faster than usual. The Bavarian orchestra plays very well for Kleiber, and their precision is amazing.<br /><br />It should be mentioned the source of this disc is a cassette owned by Carlos Kleiber's son;  the original reel tape had deteriorated, and when Orfeo decided to release this recording, it was deemed not acceptable as a source recording.  So the dynamic range is a bit narrow (technology is amazing, but it can only do so much) and not as open as one might expect a 22 year old recording to be.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Beethoven 6, but a worthy one in my library to stand by Bohm, Walter, Klemperer, Bernstein/Vienna, Monteux/Vienna and Karajan/Berlin (1976).  Recommended, but it will not be to all tastes.
B0002IU988|5.0|This record is just too cool. For being a debut album, Alter Bridge have done a great job on this. They got a better vocal than Creed and Mark Tremonti shreds more than before in this album. IMO, almost all of the songs are catchy and more melodic than other Creed songs that will make you desire to listen to it again and again. The guitar playing in Open Your Eyes, Find The Real and some other tracks are awesome, that we can't hardly find it in the past Creed songs. No matter a Creed fans you're or not, this album is a must buy CD. It worths your money.
B00005JOI3|2.0|Lovers of \\"Stay\\" accuse its critics of \\"not understanding\\" the movie, or of being so dumb that we need to be spoon-fed a Hollywood narrative. So let me start by saying I understand it. I know the story it's telling - Henry Letham is dying on the road after an accident, and what we're seeing is a scenario constructed by his dying brain as he struggles with the decision to hang on or to give in to guilt and let go. This isn't fully revealed until the film's final minutes, but it is at that point made abundantly clear. So I get it. It's a very old story, at least as old as Ambrose Bierce's nineteenth-century short story \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\". The story's fine. The problem I have with \\"Stay\\" is that as a film it's insufferably tedious.<br /><br />Twist movies only work when everything before the twist has been internally consistent - films like \\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (or anything else by Shyamalan, to date) work so well because you're entirely drawn in by what you think is the story only to find out, in the final act, that you've been told a very different one. This requires respect for the art of storytelling, something Marc Forster and David Benihoff seem to have forgotten. Rather than crafting a strong narrative that can be radically reinterpreted through an unexpected final revelation - as Bierce did, and as Adrian Lyne and Bruce Joel Rubin did in what is essentially the same story, \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" - they seem to have decided that a concatenation of slightly unsettling scenes, nicely shot, snappily edited, and wrapped up with a cool soundtrack is an adequate substitute. It isn't. There's a fine line between confusion that intrigues (David Lynch) and confusion that bores (film school undergrads), and \\"Stay\\" spends way too much time on the wrong side of it. In the best twist movies, you never see it coming. Here, the indeterminability of everything demands it from the outset and you just can't wait for it to arrive. What's happening isn't frightening enough, nor compelling enough - though it is, again, in \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" - for you to remain very interested otherwise. It's like a mystery without clues. We're not even given a red herring to cling to; never offered a plausible explanation for what is happening until the very end.<br /><br />The fundamental problem seems to be that Ewan McGregor's Sam Foster is posited as the central character, so all your effort goes into figuring out what is happening to him, when Ryan Gosling's Henry Letham is actually the one you should be thinking about, the one whose story this is. Unless, of course, you read the dissolves and frequent line-crossing in the editing and the occasional reference to twins to indicate that Sam is another part of Henry, although why his dying brain should construct such an elaborate third-person scenario is never justified. As others have noted, the film goes to extraordinarily elaborate lengths trying to explore this convergence without making you feel for a moment that this is interesting or meaningful, let alone plausible. Ultimately, you just get the feeling you're being elaborately toyed with, so you simply disengage, enjoy the music and the images, and wait for the big reveal. When it comes, it isn't even that good - while it does carry some emotional weight, it's ultimately as unmotivated as what's come before it. At least Jacob Singer had a mission, a goal, something he had to do in order to break free. All Henry seems to have is a brain haemorrhage.<br /><br />Knowing how it ends, I suspect that if you watched this film a few more times you might discover the arcane semiotic system that Forster has presumably deployed here which points to the truth of what's happening, right from the start, e.g. Forster has stated in interviews that McGregor's trousers are stupidly short because that's how Henry would see them from his prone position on the road. Great, but who the hell is going to work that out while watching the film? Nobody, which is why Forster's been forced to explain it in interviews. I really hope such detailed symbolism is there. Films like this should bear repeated viewings. But the real test is whether they work the first time you see them. This one doesn't.ch is why Forster's been forced to explain it in interviews. I really hope such detailed symbolism is there. Films like this should bear repeated viewings. But the real test is whether they work the first time you see them. This one doesn't.
B0002X314C|5.0|You need to take time to listen to this album. The first half is mostly about sleeping around; it expresses the real world for someone who's having an affair. Many wil recognise the described situation. Then, Mr Legend changes the tune, from Ordinary People, here comes the love songs & ballads. The lyrics touched my heart, beautiful love songs. Stay with you & So High reminds of true love and how precious it is. These two made me cry.  <br />Even if you dont like 'this kind of music' I would recommend this album, give it a try, you wont regret, promise.Thanx John Legend, God Bless you.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|I have to admit I almost completely stopped listening to E.C. about 30 years ago, there have been moments of excelence Me and Mr. Johnson, riding With King,Unplugged and Just One Night however after E.C. first solo cd things went downhill and have continued to slide ever since. Eric needs to play the blues to sound good not 461 Ocean Blvd. or the other nonsense he has recorded over the years. This cd is no exception it fits in with the majority of his past work. I used to think Clapton really appreciated the blues, if you want real blues go buy John Hammond or Charlie Musselwhite, John Lee Hooker etc. and as far as Clapton being the God of guitar open your ears to Sonny Landreth,Al DiMeola, John hammond, Ry Cooder,Jeff Beck and the list goes on and on. Sorry Eric glad I just listened to this and never bought it.
B000AP04MO|5.0|A brilliant, funny, sad and true screenplay is the basis for this, one of the great films of the late 1960's. Director Stanley Donen who is blessed with wit and talent has headed such films as \\"Singing In The Rain\\", \\"Funny Face\\", and \\"Charade\\". Here he has assembled a marvelous cast in one of his finest efforts. It is one of his cleverest works that interlaces the past, present and future in one beautifully realized stream of consciousness in the now.<br /><br />  One of the standout supporting performers is Eleanor Bron an accomplished British actress whom American audiences may remember as Patsy's mother from \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\". She is incredible with her very Bryn Mawr accent as one half of a parent team who is completely run by her bratty demanding child. She is just a joy to watch as the uncomfortable comedy unfolds.<br /><br />  Albert Finney is fine in the demanding role of Mark Wallace, a young reluctant to marry fellow who at first prefers Jacqueline Bisset's more voluptuous charms to the more sophisticated allure of Audrey Hepburn. He hits all the right notes from early romance to bored married man.<br /><br />  In this film we are given perhaps the finest of Audrey Hepburn's film performances. She is allowed to go to places in her character that few of her earlier films permitted. In the hands of a brilliant man like Donen she is an unfolding revelation of star power, talent and beauty. It is interesting to note that this is one of the few films in which Hubert De Givenchy did not dress her. Donen wanted a more realistic woman of her means and place. But even in off the rack clothes she looks incredible.<br /><br />  Of course a great film always begins with a great screenplay and in \\"Two For The Road\\" we have a wonderful example of screenwriting by Fredric Raphael. I am especially fond of his sharp and still fresh use of time bending. Note how the Mark and Joanna of the late 60's pass the Mark and Joanna of the late 50's on the road. This writer takes us on a wonderful and insightful look into a marriage and what it takes to make it work.<br /><br />  Cinematography by Christopher Challis is so crisp that it seems to have been shot only last week. Filled with the glorious panorama of France on the road, this is an utterly gorgeous film to watch.<br /><br />  Also contributing to the film is composer Henry Mancini who with his haunting and evocative score brings so much to the feel and pace of the story. This is one of his best scores in a career filled with great music.<br /><br />  Ultimately with all the wonderful contributions by all the artists and players one must tip one's hat to the genius behind it all, a great director and a fine artist in every sense, Stanley Donen. A real treat in this DVD of the Twentieth Century Fox Film Classics series is the addition of Mr. Donen's witty and delightful reminiscences of the making of the film on the director's commentary track. Like is commentary on the Criterion Collection of \\"Charade\\" Mr. Donen is just a joy to listen to. It is as if he has just dropped by to watch the film with you and in so doing he reveals himself to be nothing more than a charming man full of great stories to tell.and insightful look into a marriage and what it takes to make it work.

1883217040|2.0|When I finished my classical training, I picked up this book with enthusiasm and have been working with it on & off for 2 years. Levine wrote a book that was sorely needed in music education, but I am anticipating another edition since I have severe criticisms of the book that are probably more the fault of Levine's editors than his.  <br /> <br />Firstly, there are too many musical examples in this book. It would be better to stick to a handful of artists to demonstrate a lot of points. Levine frequently goes off into tangents of just listing artists . The book could have been cut in half because of this and more time devoted to explaining concepts. <br />Secondly, the book is written in a conversational style which often makes it difficult to follow because written and spoken word are two different entities.  <br />Thirdly, the book is overwhelming because of the first reason I mentioned as well as some of the chapters are huge. Ch. 3 should have been 3 seperate chapters.  <br />Fourthly, Levine needs to work with his editors in finding a better way to present the core concepts, especially in Pt. 1, I found myself scratching my head sometimes trying to figure out just what Levine was getting at even though I understand harmony well. It is often on the tip of Levine's tongue and he doesn't lay it out for his reader. <br />Finally, only half of the page is printed on. Sher Music Publishing could have used the entire page and reduced the price of the book. This isn't related to the actual content of the book, but if your a student tight on money, this is significant. <br /> <br />The fundamental question for any jazz theory book is this: what distinguishes jazz from other types of music? Improvisation is not a sufficient answer since Jazz has some serious rules just as any human language does. Levine still needs to better synthesize his knowledge so it is more accesible to his readers. After reading his book, I still feel that I need to go to another book to find more information.
B00005JJX8|5.0|What may be considered a minor work for Hitchcock, \\"To Catch A Thief\\" would be considered a great film if directed by anyone else. This little jewel from Monaco is in fact a great film, which has been overshadowed by its less glamorous siblings such as \\"North By Northwest\\".<br /><br />  As retired jewel thief John Robie \\"The Cat\\" Cary Grant is every inch a study in grace, strength and agility in all areas of his life, be it eluding the French police to escaping the finely set trap of Pacific Northwest Heiress Grace Kelly. He is as always the perfect image of a movie star and brings with him all the charm and style we expect from Cary Grant, but just beneath the surface there is something else. John Robie is someone who is hiding the real man he used to be submerged below the smooth glamour of his post war persona. He is very like the Cockney Archie Leach that lived buried deep below the skin of Cary Grant. This makes his performance all the more complex and compelling to watch. The duality of the star mirrors the duality of the character.<br /><br />  Grace Kelly is of course the perfection of all the blonde, icy hot, impossibly smart and beautiful objects of the Hitchcock world. But she two is hiding something in her performance in this film as she did all of her films. Just like Grant she is an imposter hiding behind a movie star. It is all in her voice, that beautiful upper mid Atlantic accent that no one else in her Philadelphia background shares.  Her Frances Stevens is from the Northwest but by way of Bryn Mawr or Wellesley she has eradicated her past almost as well as Robie The Cat. Almost, that is except for the presence on this trip to the south of France of her bejeweled and earthy Mother.<br /><br />  Thus in the high and rarefied atmosphere of Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo, these two imposters meet and are drawn by mutual understanding and attraction into a perfect little Hitchcock mystery.  To watch these two unearthly beautiful actors as they move through the hotels, beaches and villas of the area is to watch perfection in every sense of divine fakery and double sided joy of their beauty and talent.<br /><br />  Jesse Royce Landis appears as Kelly's mother and with only a few words and a look nearly steals the picture. She is the only person in the story who is not hiding who she really is and in so doing is the comic center of not only the jewel thief's attentions but the pictures as well. She is the hook upon which the crook hangs.<br /><br />  The screenplay by John Michael Hayes who also wrote such varied fair as \\"Butterfield-8\\", \\"Peyton Place\\" and \\"Rear Window\\" here in this work comes up with some of the most clever lines and double entendre in the genre:<br /><br />John Robie: Say something nice to her, Danielle.<br /><br /> Danielle: She looks a lot older up close.<br /><br /> Frances: To a mere child, anything over twenty might seem old.<br /><br />  The dialog is funny and full of delirious wit and a little wisdom as well.<br /><br />  Just like the two main characters in the film, \\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a great film hiding behind the mask of it's reputation as one of it's genius director's lesser efforts, don't buy it for a second. It is first-rate entertainment and not a paste imitation among the jewels of Hitchcock's repertoire.

0553801503|3.0|We have all been waiting for, literally, years and years for \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"  We have all enjoyed or loved the first three volumes, full of wonderous places, realistic charcaters, and pithy plot.  We were all hoping that the long delay in volume 4 was because a superbly-crafted, tightly-written volume with top-notch editing was forthcoming.  We wanted a quick refresher and then a brisk plot featuring the key characters and moving towards an exciting conclusion in the next book.<br /><br />Alas, nothing of the kind is to be found in \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"<br /><br />Yes, the book brings us back to the plot lines--all of them--ever further afield-- that marked the first three books.  Yes, it picks up the pieces after epic battles, just as we'd expect.  But then, sadly, not much happens.  We are re-introduced to everyone, and the plot moves forward a little.  That's not much to say for a 700-page opus.<br /><br />Apparently, this volume was oft-delayed because it grew so ponderous that one book was split into two--and this was just the first half, with much of the excitement and development coming in the next half, now destined to be another volume.<br /><br />That all said, fans of the series will just have to buy and read this and hope for some plot acceleration and better editing in the next book.  And hope that we do not die of old age before the series concludes?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  This isn't a bad book, just rather ponderous and a bit fractured.  Martin will have a chance to recover in the next volume with some hard, fast work!
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|Following Live 8 i have to wonder if Live Aid justifies the euphoria that followed it. Most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its aims-well that's debatable. What it did manage to do was make Bob Geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you. Before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name, knighted by the monarchy and very,very rich. The same with U2 pushed them into the statosphere and made Bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet. Same with Queen pushed them into mega-stardom. So do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity, push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time. Sounds pretty good to me. One can't help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming 'give me your money'. There was a shot(deleted of course) where backstage the good and the great were dining on expensive food and wine whilst up on stage was a backdrop of the starving. Another example of there hyprocrisy. Madonna singing 'imagine' on her latest tour '..imagine-no prosessions..yeah right! I can't help but think for all there posturing there was an eye on global exposure and a chance to feel good about themselves when they went back to their mansion and who would dispute that McCartneys version of 'let it be' was stomach churning? Face it the only musician (Peter Green ex-fleetwood mac) who wanted to give everything away to charity got certified. Proves a point.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Wow Just seen the first 3 episodes of \\"Our new life in Everwood\\" [UK Title] on TV. We are only on season one and its on daytime tv - no prime time as yet.  This is a really well thought out series. Lots of everything and so far not afraid to tackle sensitive subjects!  Well done and can't wait to see season 2 3 and 4!   <br />Will be collecting the DVD's
B000002L99|5.0|I am a VH fan and to me this is their best album.  It really has it all: a great mix of melodies and guitar rock.  What makes Eddie so great is his unreal guitar skills combined with his ability to write memorable tunes and no VH album shows that better than 5150. <br /> <br />I have to disagree with some who think Eddie's best work was earlier in his career.  As great as his early playing was (and it was great), I think it was a little one dimensional.  His later work shows improved sophistication and real mastery of the instrument.  His ability to compose a good melody and put underneath it a complex guitar accompanyment (it's so busy it's hard to call it accompanyment) really shines on 5150.  Listen to what he's doing on some of the songs while Sammy is singing.  I don't know how he does it.  Also, the solos that Eddie plays on this CD are universally awesome. <br /> <br />If I was forced to give away my CD's except for a few, this would be one of the last to go.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I have read through the other posts for Prairie Wind, and everyone's comparisons of Priaire Wind to this Neil album or that Neil album - always a waste of time with any artist that grows older and changes with the time.  I do understand some of the frustration of some of the listeners - you can't always follow even your favorite artists through all of their phases.  Heck, I lost Springsteen in the 80's, and have only enjoyed his two acoustic albums since (I don't even want to talk about Devils and Dust).  But we are discussing Neil's new album . . .I found it comforting, emotionally moving in its personal touches (especially his thoughts on his dad), and Falling Off the Face . . . is simply a beautiful love song from the perspective of a man who struggles to make his emotions known.  The only thing that bugged me a bit was using the orchestration a little heavy handed on too many of the tracks.  I prefer the raw sound.  I honestly cannot reccommend a better fall album than Prairie Wind, and I look forward to grabbing my lawn seat this summer to watch Ol'Neil givin' it to us live.  For those who missed the Greendale concerts, I am sorry to tell you that you missed one of the greatest performances of any musician in the thirty years that I have been attending concerts.
0385474547|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews of this book and I think the people that rated it poorly are looking for the book to just tell them everything so they don't have to do any thinking whatsoever. This book opens the mind to other cultures. Yes, I don't necessarily agree that drinking palm-wine out of a human head (of the human you killed) is good, but that's because it's a different culture. They would think it's weird for us not to; they would think our customs are strange. But this book really made me think about this man, Okonkwo, and what he would do for his interpretation of his image. I do agree that you don't have sympathy for this character but I don't think you always have to like the characters in the books you are reading. I did have sympathy and felt for his family though. It's not about the character himself, it's about his journey. I enjoyed this book and I read it for the plain fact that I found it on a greatest books of all time list. I cried during this book. Most books can't get me to cry because it's either not descriptive enough or I'm just not emotionally attached in the book; but this book I felt a connection to. I also found it really easy to read. Yes, there are strange names that I still don't know how to pronounce. Mainly, I think I took away something good from this book and that's what I had hoped for. So, if you want to learn about another culture and have a book question you and your emotions and beliefs, then by all means, read this book. It's amazing.
B000062Y98|5.0|Well I have to say I regret not giving this album much of a chance when I frist picked it up in 2001 shorly after its release. I always said \\"yeah its good...\\" Wow how much have I matured since then!! This album is absolutly incredible I think the reason I wasnt so enthused about it was that my first BG experience was Nightfall... and I LOVE that album it is in my opinion one of the top 5 of all time. Night at the Opera has such a different sound to it but its SO original and musically mature, with the guitars and better choruses and THE DRUMMING!!!!  The Drumming is SO amazing!! On Wait for an answer the Drums are so powerful, I get chills down my back even to this day. That is perhaps the best or at least my Fav song, next to Age of False Innocence and Battle field. The whole production is just stunning, after a long highetus of listening to this album, I left it in my car CD player for like a week and a half!! And when I go out today im going to put it back in. Bravo BG Bravo, I don't have to hope there next album due out next spring will be equal to this, BG is simply the most reliable band out there.
0141439661|4.0|One thing needs to be made clear before reading this book; the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility\\" do not mean the same things today as they did in Jane Austen's time. Though `sense' referred to intelligence and the ability to judge situations well, `sensibility' had connotations to having appropriate sensitivity toward moral and artistic issues, linked with the superiority of a person's aesthetical `senses'. As such, there is room for debate over which sister represents which trait, something seemingly obvious from the outset of the book, but which dramatically changes by its conclusion (which amusingly mirrors the ongoing debate over which traits Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy embody in the title of their story \\"Pride and Prejudice\\").<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was Austen's first novel, and as such is considered her weakest by the critics, though this also means it is also the most accessible and easy-to-read novel. First novels are almost always the most amateurish, and as such it is a much simpler work, from the storyline to the sentence structure, which leads to an easier reading experience than her more complex novels (\\"Emma\\" and the aforementioned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"). Anyone new to the world of Austen is best to start here as the easiest book with which to ease into her range of novels.<br /><br />The sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are extreme opposites; oldest sibling Elinor uses her head, whilst the younger Marianne follows her heart; but for all of this, the two are very close. After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne - along with their mother and younger sister - are forced to give up their comfortable estate to their stepbrother (the product of their father's first marriage) and sister-in-law due to the inheritance law. But before relocating to Barton Cottage, Elinor forms an attachment with Fanny Dashwood's brother Edward Ferrars, a shy and awkward, but good-hearted man. Hoping that her feelings are returned, but unable to make any advances, Elinor travels to Barton Cottage in the hopes that he will return to her there in the near future.<br /><br />At Barton Cottage, the girls make many new acquaintances, in particular the loud and bustling matriarch Mrs Jennings who is determined to marry the girls off as quickly as can be, and the quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. As for the romantic and dreamy Marianne, she's fallen hopelessly in love with the dashing John Willoughby after he rescues her from a rainy day and a twisted ankle whilst out walking in the countryside - much to the dismay of the smitten Colonel Brandon. Already concerned at Marianne's overly romantic disillusions, Elinor is concerned at her rather wanton behaviour in the presence of her new beau, but is then has her attention drastically diverted on being introduced to a Miss Lucy Steele who has a secret to share about Edward Ferrars...<br /><br />The story winds its way through the girls' negotiations with the society they live in, the restrictions held upon them and the individuals which hold power over them - not with the same deftness that Austen displays in later novels, but still with much thought-provoking commentary. The family's plight in being reduced to guests in their own home at Norland, at the mercy of their somewhat dim-witted brother is particularly revealing as to the social injustices of the time, and though the frustrations of the girls' status is never explicitly stated, it is readily evident for anyone willing to read between the lines. At the end of the day, all they have is each other and the fervent hope that they will find both happiness and security in marriage. Their trials in love are perhaps the most heart-rending experiences of any other Austen heroines, (where romances are either touched by irony or poignancy) in the fact that a happy ending is not guaranteed for the sisters and that their future happiness depends on a good match - it particular it is hard not to feel your heart break for Marianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.<br /><br />The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible. Elinor is the sort of person you would desperately wish for in your life in order to benefit from her good sense and protective nature, whilst Marianne is utterly charming in her romantic flights of fancy (in fact she's so winsome and dreamy that it's almost a shame when she gains some `sense' at the novel's end - one would have been contented to have her indulge in her dreaming forever). Though the novel is told almost solely through Elinor's eyes, in several ways Marianne is the main protagonist, who goes through the most trials and changes. Whatever your own opinions, the two provide an excellent foil for each other, and at all times the sisterly bond between them is apparent.<br /><br />There have been so many adaptations of Jane Austen novels throughout the years, though to my mind none is better than Ang Lee's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel.arianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.<br /><br />The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible.

As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel.
0553275976|5.0|Bonfire of the Vanities has long been hailed as one the greatest (the greatest?) American novels of the 1980's, and its accolades bear little use repeating. Nevertheless, a new look at this classic novel provides ample proof that while many aspects of society have changed in the nearly two decades since Bonfire was published, a great many other have, sadly, not.  Just add Starbucks, the Internet, and cellular phones; you'll find that the world described by this novel is very much alive in Gotham today.  <br />     Literary celebrity and brilliant self-promoter Tom Wolfe did meticulous research on both the upper crust and under belly of Reagan Era New York City to craft this incisive, complicated, dense, and comic tale of racial unrest, political bickering, and blind sighted American bourgeois insularity.  Darting from the dilapidated housing projects of the South Bronx to the gilded penthouses of Park Avenue, Wolfe spins his tale around the fictional personage of Sherman McCoy: a WASP wall street powerhouse, a self-described \\"Master of the Universe\\", and a man who due to an accidental and tragic visit to the South Bronx ends up igniting the collective and seething racial and socioeconomic tensions vibrating beneath New York's polarized population. Mr. Wolfe has painted a rich and multifaceted ethnic landscape to navigate, avoiding any and all simplistic cultural syllogisms in lieu of both character and cultural specificity, with all of the complexity and contradictions that come with it.  Though it has a Dramatis Personae the size of a Dickens novel, none of the characters are turned into caricature; indeed, every individual is sympathetic in Wolfe's world, though none are overtly heroic or free of troubling ethical transgression.  It is a testimony to Wolfe's skill as a writer that, though this southern WASP in the famous white suit bears little relation to many of Bonfire's most colorful characters, he always presents them with conviction and believability.   Hisdetailed descriptions of various social and professional rituals at various levels of New York life give the reader the detail needed to invest imaginatively in the lives of the many characters populating Bonfire's New York.  Whether it be the perpetually caffeinated barking of a Wall Street Investment Firm's trading floor, or the grinding, discouraging monotony of the legal machinations in the South Bronx courthouse, the reader is no doubt given the impression that this is how it really was.  The zenith of this is an extended chapter in which Wolfe intricately (and often hilariously) describes an uber-posh dinner party at a palatial 5th Avenue apartment.  One can almost taste the foie gras pate and Dom Perignon.   <br />     A lesser writer could let all this detail weigh him down and cause an otherwise interesting book to have all the buoyancy of sunken treasure chest.  Bonfire's prose eschews this particularly precarious trap.  The narrative often oscillates between traditional 3rd person description and 1st person expression.  Depending on which character is being focused on at any given moment, their own point-of-view on the narrative is seamlessly woven into the prose allowing the story to take on an emotional immediacy and deeper sense of perspective.   Most importantly, the plot itself is a thoroughly designed piece of machinery that allows Wolfe to go on his descriptive tangents without harming the book's internal feng-shui. Indeed, the story's momentum is built on this specificity.  While the general points in the storyline could be churned out in any Law & Order episode, Bonfire's power cannot be reduced to a simple plot description. It is not about the guilt or innocence of it's characters. Instead, the author is putting a whole era on trial. No doubt Wolfe does have an agenda (it would be foolish and impossible to imagine any writer worth his salt without one) but it only is apparent in an overarching view of the work as a whole, and is never overtly didactic.   <br />    This being said, Bonfire of the Vanities is a book about the dangers of a stratified society, in which an egregiously affluent echelon of the population ignores the clearly deteriorating circumstances of less-fortunates around them.  Equally dangerous are the politicians, public servants, \\"community leaders\\" and \\"journalists\\" who, in order to appease the mob and advance their careers, exploit these deeply troublesome socio-economic tensions with shallow displays of self-righteous verbosity and hyped-up social hysteria.  What makes Bonfire such a classic is the way Wolfe presents these social problems as a result of the elaborate Rube Goldberg device that was (is?) contemporary American metropolitan society.   This is illustrated with astute clarity by his representation of established government bureaucracy's engagment with the ever-churning melting pot of American culture, as typified by the extremely volatile ethnic smorgasbord of New York City. Running parallel and counterpoint to this is the way the Press uses these often complex problems to advance it's own agenda and increase it's profit-margin.   The characters and plot of the book move like a machine, each person doing what is generally expected of him given his social position, occupation and (less so) personal commitments.  Nevertheless, the problems of the characters, both lowly and highbrow, are not easily resolved.  The real culprit is the excesses of the 1980's, and they have never been presented with as much clarity, insight, heart and humor as in The Bonfire of the Vanities.  Of course, the lessons of the book were hardly learned, and America today has yet to escape the problems that Tom Wolfe so exquisitely and satirically addresses in this masterwork of the contemporary American novel.
0553801503|5.0|While I absolutely believe that there is no 'right' or 'wrong' response to a book, because it's all just personal opinion, I'm taken aback by some of the hostility I'm seeing here. <br /> <br />If you went to see a play, would  you complain the story wasn't finished at the end of the first act? No. There's an interval and then there's a second act, and then there's the end. So okay, this story has more than 2 acts. By the end it will have, maybe, 7. So it's not really fair to say 'these characters aren't important' or 'this was just a bridge' or 'we didn't get to the end' ...  because until we do reach the end, we can't tell. <br /> <br />I believe Martin is the single greatest fantasy writer of our time. I think he will go down in history as one of the greatest, full stop. Was I frustrated at the long time between books 3 and 4? You'd better believe it. Am I sorry that some of my favourite characters didn't appear in Feast? Yes. I'm desperate to know what's happening with Tyrion. But that's what I get for not waiting till the completion of the series. I'm reading it in installments and not all my questions will be answered right away. One possible explanation for people's dissatisfaction is that this isn't a 'complete' novel the way books 1-3 are ... it is a single entity split in two. Is that a fault? Perhaps, but I'm not upset by it. <br /> <br />Martin has spent 30 years honing his craft and perfecting his narrative skills, and I believe we as readers are reaping the benefits. I loved this book, and I eagerly look forward to the next part of the story. This is a saga of unequalled breadth and passion, with characters who live, for me, more powerfully than any other in fiction at the moment. <br /> <br />Bravo, Mr Martin. You're to be congratulated.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|There are not enough stars available to rate this DVD concert by the Eagles!  What an awesome, incredible, fantastic concert. If you have not bought this DVD yet - add it quick to your collection.   What other band is there where all the band members can belt out a great song, play a variety of instruments, still outshine the big band behind them, and do all this over for the last 30+ years....and I'll show you the Eagles!  Besides the incredible music, the change from song to song (what a great, wide range of music styles), the quality of this DVD was incredible.  Walsh's true beauty in lead guitar really shows up on disk 2. Henley may look older (and even more handsome) but his voice hasn't changed one day - stunning.   Hope they are still jamming as hard when their 80 CUZ we are ALL getting old.  We can't wait for their concert to come to our state - we'll be the first in line!
B000B5UL7G|4.0|First off let me admit that I have been a fan of Robbie ever since Angels, which hardly makes me unique. Secondly, I genuinely believe that Robbie Williams is perhaps the greatest performer the UK has ever produced. However after his split from Guy Chambers who Robbie had once described as \\"as much a part of Robbie Williams as I am\\", I must confess i initially had my doubts about his future, particularly after hearing his subsequent singles, Radio and Misunderstood.<br /><br />How wrong was I? With the release of Intensive Care, Robbie has vanquished all doubts about his credibility as a songwriter and emerged triumphant with what is almost certainly his most mature effort to date. And i don't see any road back for Mr Chambers now...<br /><br />My favourite track is \\"Advertising Space\\" a ballad about Elvis Presley, you can almost see the video already,; clips of Elvis interspersed with Robbie singing earnestly. I love this track and maybe this will be the one to launch him in America, although for Mr Williams that might turn out to be a mixed blessing. Other stand out tracks include \\"Make Me Pure\\", \\"Tripping\\" \\"Please Don't Die\\", \\"Your Gay Friend\\" and \\"Sin, Sin, Sin\\". I think there are a couple of weaker tracks but there is also plenty of Rob's usual irony and self-deprecating wit and charm (and a little ham) on display here.<br /><br /> In summary, there is plenty here to keep his existing fan base happy and more than enough ammunition to silence the doubters and attract new fans. Oh and two potentially massive singles in \\"Make Me Pure\\" and \\"Advertising Space\\", although I'm sure other people will have different favourites. Four stars ****.
B00065JTBA|5.0|A great collection! This box set is a piece that all Bon Jovi fans must have.
B0007GAERG|5.0|First off, I never really did like Mariah Carey before, since i didn't listen to her early works. But i did like contemporary R&B artists like Beyonce or Usher. When I heard We Belong Together, I knew I had to buy this album. Although \\"It's like\\" that wasn't all that great, but the second single was awesome <br /> <br />A few songs that really get your attention in this CD are We Belong Together, Shake it Off, Mine Again, Say Somethin, Get Your Number,Stay The Night, Circles, I wish you knew, and To the floor. The song that fall under the R&B genre are We Belong Together, Shake it off, One and Only, Joy ride, Fly like a bird. Among them the first three are carried out excellently, and i mean excellent in all ways, in vocals and style. The other ones are good but not as good as the others. We Belong together Is absolutely a beautiful song and should nab a grammy for best R&B performance by female. Shake It off is really catchy, there is the \\"Shake, Shake, Shake It Off\\" with the piano in the back. Lyrics of this song show that mariah is better off without a guy, that is quite silly in contrast to what she says in We Belong Together. <br /> <br />Then there are, of course the more upbeat, beyonce-type songs. They include the neptunes produced, absolutely hip song To the Floor with Nelly. The beat is really good, and this is applicable for parties. This section also includes the 4th single get Your Number with Jermaine Dupri. This song is also unbelievable. Its about Dupri tryin to get Mimi's number, and Mimi is impressed by him and asks him to tell something about him and tells stuff about herself. And again he just wants her number. Again, absolutely great beats. This might be upto some extent better than To the Floor. Of course there is It's Like that. This song tells us about the celebration due to the emancipation of Mimi. She seems somewhat, very happy in this song. I dont kno if Say somethin is a song for this category but i guess it is a bit upbeat. <br /> <br />Then there are the ballads, one more beautiful than the other. Starting off with the best one Circles. Excellent Vocals.......A Truly Amazing Voice this woman has. Mine Again Sounds like an R&B song in the begining but later u kno its a ballad, where outstanding vocal effort is put. But Circles seems better to me. Then there is a jazz number, Stay the Night. Again, The vocals are splendid and this song's instrumental play will impress you. I Wish You Know is a good song, nothing unique but still good. <br /> <br />Then again, if you haven't bought this yet, wait until thee special platinum edition is out. With only about 7 bucks more, you get 4 songs that include Don't forget about us, a single with Jermaine Dupri, The Remix of We Belong Together with Jadakiss and Styles, and One and Only's Part II. Of course, let's not forget you get this whole album and a DVD with the videos of It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It off and Get Your Number! It's a pretty good deal. And the album cover is hotter as well. <br /> <br />That's all i Have to say for this album and I really think It should make Mimi one of this year's top Grammy Contenders. I think she is going to get nominated possibly for <br /> <br />Best R&B female vocal performance by Female - We belong Together <br />Best Contemporary R&B album- The Emancipation of Mimi <br />Best R&B Song - Shake It Off <br />Best Pop Performance by a Duo or group - Get Your Number (w/Jermaine Dupri) <br />Song of The Year - Shake It Off <br />Album of The year - Emancipation of Mimi <br />Short Form Music video - Shake It off <br />Im not sure if she's gonna get a nod for Record of the year s that's a pretty tough Category to get a nomination for. <br /> <br />For the record You should really know: <br /> <br />1) Mariah is the best selling female artist of All time <br />2) She is the female artist to have the most Number Ones, 14 to be more precise with Madonna Having 12 So far. <br />3) She is the top contender for theAMAs. <br /> <br />That's about it I have to say for this CD. Its really something I would recommend to anyone who is a Pop/R&B fan. If you're too engrossed with Rock and don't like Beyonce, Alicia Keys or Christina Aguilera, don't buy this but if you wanna try out something and start listening to r&B or pop or hip-hop, buy this.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I'm not exactly sure why some people seem to detest supergroups. Now, when most people learned that Chris Cornell was joining forces with the Rage Against the Machine instrumentalists, they probably thought they would produce one album and that's it, because regardless of how good the material is, supergroups usually break up pretty quickly (Zwan, anyone?). But Audioslave proved people wrong by not only producing a hit single on their first album (\\"Like a Stone\\"), but they also came back with a second album, Out of Exile.<br /><br />I have to say that this is a remarkable album, but I also noticed that the band played it safe for the first two singles. I'm not saying that \\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" aren't good songs, but they kind of pale in comparison to the rest of the album. There are other great songs like \\"The Curse\\", \\"Heaven's Dead\\", and the title track. \\"The Worm\\" is another good one, but I think maybe it should have been called \\"Halo\\" instead (listen to the song to understand what I mean).<br /><br />I disagree with the people that say that Chris can't sing, because his vocals work well against the still tight musical backdrops (and I forgot how great a guitarist Tom Morello was). Oh, well; while I couldn't quite get into \\"Drown Me Slowly\\", I'll say you'd be out of your mind to not pick up Out of Exile.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I've been a pretty big admirer of Depeche Mode since I first heard the dark strains of A Question of Time when I was twelve years old or so and I have to say, this new work blows me completely away.<br /><br />It delicately combines the beautifully austere, aesthetically crafted formalism that made Violator such a masterpiece, with a gritty, industrial minimalism, giving a result that comes, in my opinion, pretty close to the ideal Depeche Mode album. And this when most bands of their lonegvity would be falling prey to unwitting self-parody or ill-advised experimentation with \\"new\\" sounds which too often results in something like pastiche.<br /><br />The key it seems is that Depeche Mode, although variously reviewing their musical vision, have always retained the structural core that defines them as Depeche Mode - that dark, goth-invoking electronic play that has marked them from the very beginning. To that end I have always thought \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion\\", although still really good, is their weakest album. Over-produced and over-performed, it comes over as well, just a bit too over-cooked, a bit too rich.<br /><br />Where \\"Playing the Angel\\" differs is in a stripped-down sound, there's a minimalist aesthetic at play here, every sound is distinct and there's a palpable space between all the sounds, which gives it a clarity that has not been heard since \\"Violator\\".<br /><br />Finally, the album doesn't drag on and on, like way too many albums these days, which is another strength. It clocks in at around 50 minutes, there's definitely no filler at all, and the songs move intensely and quickly, hitting you hard then moving on without getting tired.<br /><br />Currently my faves include \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" - it's just classic DM bleakness expressed in great riffs and song structure;  \\"John the Revelator\\" for the intensity and strength of its bass and rhythm arrangements, and \\"Precious\\" just for being a classic electronic tune that somehow seems to combine the best of the 80s, 90s and 00s so far in a glorious piece of pop music.<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars.lorious piece of pop music.    4 1/2 Stars.
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|I can't believe people are giving this five stars.  An excessive portion of this movie is devoted to the football game, and it just gets repetitive and boring.  The laughs are few and the classic Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison esque humor is not intact.  Some of the scenes in this movie are so unrealistic that I wanted to vomit.  Like the scene when steve austin shoots that gun, and the pellets ricochet across the room for an unreasonable amount of time.  Also, Adam Sandler's reckless behavior that gets him arrested was not very realistic either. The deficit of humor in this one solidifies my negative assessment.  Stick to a good Adam Sandler movie.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I'll start off by saying that while I do agree with some of the reviewers here that stated that System of a Down sounds different without Serj singing lead and that the lyrics to most songs seem very simplistic and repetitive... these are not problems. <br /> <br />For the former, I don't think that is such a bad thing... there is a lot more of a melody in most songs now (much more than in previous records) with many of them having complex and haunting harmonizing between the two singers. For the latter, I'm not sure if people complaining about the lyrics have listened to that much SOAD :\ A LOT of their songs from older albums are quite repetitive. Other complaints that I saw dealt with their music lacking creativity and complexity... how many metal bands out there write songs in complex time signatures? Most everything: rock/pop is written in 4/4... not the case with System of a Down, with many songs written in disjointed alternating time signatures (6/8 & 5/8 or 5/4, 4/4, & 3/4) A good song to hear this on is Question!, as another reviewer mentioned.  While some of the songs on this album are mocking something (Violent Pornography, Cigaro, Old School Hollywood, Lost in Hollywood), others are more subversive with lyrics riddled in politics or religion (Question!, Sad Statue) <br /> <br />Their musicality has definitely grown since their first album, and I look forward to future releases. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This was the first Mars Volta CD I've ever heard. I liked a few songs at first, but one morning I woke up with song lyrics in my head. This happened for about a week, and that was it. I was addicted to the Mars Volta. This CD is a masterpiece, not for the impatient listener. If you have an open mind and don't get bored with 15 minute songs, you will love it...
0553801503|4.0|Martin delivers another solid book filled with his fascinating and vexing mix of revealing just enough plotline and history to make the readers satisfied and hunger for more.  The major complaint here is the lack of completion, but Martin throws more and more characters into the mix, even though there's an awful lot of Cersei and Jaime, who dominate the book. <br /> <br />The good thing, of course, is the afterward that says there's already pages and pages of characters like Tyrion, Jon, and of course Bran, who has the biggest cliffhanger of all the characters after A Clash of Kings.  The book is an excellent continuation and will make you wait as impatiently for the next book as you did for this one.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|So bad its funny adaptation of the Comic book Hellblazer is such a multi-car wreck that it's almost too bad to watch. Keanu Reeves is so bad in the role that he should be a comedian instead of an actor because almost all of his scenes in this film are funny. His deliveries of his lines are so bad that you can come up with better lines before he's able to say the dialog. He demeanor borders on stupidly and he's even upstage by the special effects, which are not very good to begin with. It also does not help when you have a script that is so unfocused and so badly written that you as a audience member can't suspend disbelief on what is going on right in front of you while you are watching it. It's tries to be a cool version of the Exorcist but ends up being more like John Water's Pink Flamingoes but with out the camp or the humor that movie had. There is a transsexual angel that causes the horrible climax of the movie to happen and a homosexual demon that has a grudge with our dumb hero but by the time we are introduce to him, almost everybody in the audience would have a personal grudge against Keanu character for how bad the movie has turn out. <br /> <br />Surpassingly, there is some good to be found in this film and that's mainly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, who is so good in this film that you end up wondering on why the movie turn out so bad in the first place. Weisz is such a strong and talented actor that she even kinds of makes you buy on what is going on with the story but that's a uphill battle even for her great talent to succeed giving the fact that her co-star can't act if his life depended on it and the fact that the screenplay does not do her performance any justice. She's the only rose in this big pile of crap that is worth watching and that's pretty sad considering the fact that if you had a screenplay and a leading man to compliment her performance, this movie would have been much better off that it is now.
B0002PUHF6|4.0|To my opinion \\"Re-Animator\\" is the best adaptation of H.P.Lovecraft's works to date. Although it doesn't literally follow the book it's still the utmost directors managed to extract from Lovecrtaft's stories. More to it - \\"Re-Animator\\" is the best work ever (I think so) for Brian Yuzna as a producer, Stuart Gordon as a director and for Jeffrey Combs. Actually the latter became well known exactly after the role of Herbert West, the re-animator. I don't quite understand why some people consider this film cheesy - it has all the features a true horror movie must possess. It sustains the right balance between ghastliness and humor, acting is very truthful, special effects and make up are not to call middling, the score is exactly what it is supposed to be in a horror film. But what is most important - it's a good story. And this good story is very well told. This movie is one of those that reanimated the genre and shaped it to the form we observe today (I mean its best representatives of course).<br /><br />If you do have some doubts about purchasing \\"Re-Animator\\", I can tell you - buy it as soon as possible. It's a real classic although just 20 years old. Besides the edition is superb.
B000BIQKXM|5.0|Westlife proves that they still deserve to be the biggest \\"boy band\\" in the world today, though they've definitely grown up. <br /> <br />A great album and all great songs, but the best tracks are: <br />1. Maybe Tomorrow <br />2. Amazing <br />3. Hit You With The Real Thing <br />4. That's Where You Find Love
B000AARKOO|2.0|Although I had a little hope that Ridley Scott wouldn't have given the crusades a Hollywood treatment, Kingdom of Heaven turns out to be utter crap! Everyone who even has the slightest historical knowledge knows, that the cristian knights butchered all Arabs that weren't willing to accept their religious thoughts. And what do we see here? The cristians are nothing but good guys that mean no harm and the Arabs are like the indians from Dances with Wolves: humble, brave and sophisticated men with a noble code of honour. <br />The only villains in the movie are the Templars that are looking for a holy war. To achieve this they murder some innocent Arabs for no reason...so this way giving the peaceful Arabs a reason to start to fight. This movie clearly tries to build a bridge between the Western and the Eastern civilization, but fails hopelessly as it is not telling the truth.(SARR)  <br /> <br />
B00001OH7Y|5.0|The great musical chameleon had his last laugh with Scary Monsters - an album released in 1980, the last in a series of transformations through which Bowie went in a decade that was, undeniably, his more than anyone else's. It followed the mediocre Lodger - which was a disappointing conclusion to his Berlin Trilogy, and little more than a pale copy when compared to its predecessors Low and Heroes, and seemed to signal the beginning of a downward spiral for Bowie. With Scary Monsters he did a complete 180 turn, and with a total change of sound and attitude he created one of his best albums, and probably his last great creation - at least until his comeback in 1997 with the masterpiece Earthling. <br /> <br />Scary Monsters is a harsh album, with signs of punk and new-wave creeping in. It's much more song-based than the Berlin albums - or then anything since Aladdin Sane, for that matter - and is mainly focused on four hit singles that dominate the album. That's not to say the rest of the songs aren't as good; it's still a shame, though, that all of the most grandiose songs are crowded on the first half of the album, and the second half, at least on first listening, sounds just a bit weaker in comparison. First and foremost among these singles is Ashes To Ashes - one of Bowie's greatest songs, which harks back to his very first hit single and so represents some kind of closure for him. It has a haunting rhythm and mesmerizing instrumentation. Fashion is another masterwork, dark and funky, with fantastic, down and dirty guitar work by King Crimson's Robert Fripp, who is featured on several songs here. Only slightly less familiar are the brilliant title track - my personal favorite on the album - and the grandiose Teenage Wildlife, which sound like earlier Bowie more than anything else on the album. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is filled with little gems, most of all the excellent It's No Game with which the album opens and closes. Also worthy of mention are Up The Hill Backwards - also with terrific guitar by Fripp - and Because You're Young, a great rocker with Pete Townshend as a special guest playing guitar. Despite it's harsh and modern sound, Scary Monsters is in fact much less synthesized than Bowie's previous albums, and it's built around some powerful songs and great instrumental work; other than the guest guitarists already mentioned, Bowie's tight band includes Dennis Davis on drums, George Murray on bass, the great Carlos Alomar on guitars and Andy Clark on synth. It's one Bowie's most powerful and well-produced musical experiences, and is one of the greatest albums of the '80s.
B000B7HZXM|2.0|I just didnt care for this cd at all! I loved the first two , but now im kinda ready for rod to do something else! And i didnt care to much for his choice of other artists on the record! if you really want to hear a great album of remakes check out dolly partons \\"Those were the days\\" cd, and leave this one alone!
B000750OEA|3.0|CAN YOU VIEW THIS DVD IF YOU'RE IN THE U.S.? I DON'T WANT TO ORDER IT IF I CAN'T SEE IT.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Great album. Nice and aggressive. Subliminal verses is also great, they really improved their melody on this one, yet still keep all of their heaviness, unlike many bands who attempt to do this. Corey Taylor has a great voice. Shouting, growling, or singing, he's awesome. The singing shows up a lot more in Subliminal verses. All of their cds are great. Great stuff to listen to when your mad at the world or having a bad day. Just hard brutal alternative metal.
B00065GX64|5.0|German director Fritz Lang's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre) on the loose in a large German city.  It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres: police procedurals and serial killer movies.  Lang's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable.  Lorre's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him.  His tormented speech toward the end of the film, when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld, shows keen insight into the killer's condition and mental state, almost eliciting sympathy for him.  This is a stark, facinating film.
0802130208|1.0|Does nobody have the courage to say what they really thought of this book? It's like the Emperor's new clothes. There's nothing there but a lot of self indulgent, pompous tripe. <br /> <br />Let's list what the author can't do: <br />1. Write characters one can empathise with (note I don't say 'identify with' or 'like'. <br />2. Figure out a plot that would do credit to anyone beyond 2nd grade.

Nothing sparkles off the page, no ideas gleam like nuggets within the lines. It is uniformly grey. <br />5. Write well. A great author can hold your attention with the beauty of his wordcrafting.

B0000009SE|5.0|Zappa, hard to take seriously after notorius gross-out tunes like 'penis dimensions', revealed his serious musical psyche with the stunning title track 'Waka-Jawaka', an amazing piece comprised of a main theme coupled with secondary poly-melodic & counterpuntal themes, and utilizing atypical scales. The main melody grabs you and burrows into your brain, then eloquently flows into artfully crafted solos from Zappa's top-notch sidemen, who served with the likes of Buddy Rich, Benny Golson, and Bill Watrous. Don Preston's mini-moog solo is required listening for any keyboard player, along with drummer Dunbar's clinic on polyrhythm. This is an instrumental masterpiece, culminating with Zappa restating the opening horn phrase in cut-time while the band blows on in 4/4. Amazing in every respect, Waka-Jawaka whets your appetite--after 33 years, it's still as fresh to me as the first time I heard it!
0553801503|3.0|I ordered Feast from Amazon.uk to get it as quickly as I could. I've rarely had such a powerful response to a book as I did to A Storm of Swords (with the exception of Tolkien, Donaldson, and a handful of others), and couldn't wait for Feast. Last night, my roommate pointed out that I hadn't touched Feast in nine days. I was a bit surprised - it was completely unconscious. I wasn't trying to avoid it. <br /> <br />So I tried to figure out what the problem was. And it was simple. I was completely and utterly lost. It had been so long since reading Storm that it took me chapters to remember who the minor characters now given POVs were and what they had to do with everything that happened in Storm. <br /> <br />I decided, then, to do something I've never done before. I'm going to sit this out. I'll wait for Martin to finish the entire series, and then I'll go back and read it forward from A Clash of Kings (A Game of Thrones is burned into my mind - I remember more from that book, strangely enough, than I do from Storm). <br /> <br />I'll give the book a tentative three stars. I wasn't interested in it, but that may be simply because I forgot too much during the five year wait. Perhaps when I read them straight through, I'll find that I appreciate Feast a bit more. My guess is that I probably will. I have great faith that Martin will NOT turn into another Jordan. <br /> <br />Granted, had Tyrion or Bran or Jon - at least - had a POV, I might be writing a completely different \\"review\\".
B00000I41J|5.0|The richness of tone and beauty of melody achieved in these sessions is difficult to match.  Nothing is forced, everyone takes their turn without any sense of impatience or underlying rancor, yet the performances display an understanding of the opportunity and a sense that judgments will be made regarding the work  created here.  The result is a piece of art that is seemless, timeless and ever-rewarding to the listener.  It is well-recorded and balanced, displaying Alfred Lion-Rudy Van Gelder seminal production values.  Cannonball proves himself well-suited to play with the all-stars in this assemblage, but it is Miles Davis who, seemingly without effort, ascends to the top of this marvelous recording.  Stands with Kind of Blue, Blue Train, Portrait in Jazz and a few other recordings as one of the high points of the seminal era of jazz.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I saw a preview screening of Brokeback Mountain November 5th and am reviewing the soundtrack album on that basis. A different perspective.  Those of you who have commented on the album and suspect the music is used wisely in the film are right on the money.  You will not be disappointed.  If you like the film you will most likely buy the soundtrack, as I will be doing.  ADDED 12/22:  The song A Love That Will Never Grow Old is one of the most evocative songs ever written to accompany a film.  It tells the entire story in tone and brevity.  A beautiful piece of work.  Unfortunately, it will not be eligible for an Oscar.  According to Teni Melidonian from the Motion Picture Academy, explaining why:  \\"AMPAS has it's own set of rules.  The committee (made up of Music Branch members) viewed the song in the context of the film and it was determined that the song was not \\"a clearly audible, intelligible, or substantive rendition of both lyric and melody.\\"   I am afraid I have to agree.  The song is only heard in the background on a car radio during an emotional scene for maybe 15 seconds.  If only they'd just played it over the end credits as well it would've been a shoo-in.  Alas, not to be.  Another heartbreak...
B000AARKOO|5.0|When viewing a movie like this one, I know going in that I am going to have to approach it on two levels. First, I am going to assess the merit of the film on its own, how it stands as a film, on the quality of cinematic storytelling. Secondly there is the level of worldview evaluation; in other words, is the message that the movie espouses right or wrong, helpful or harmful, etc. Here is yet another Hollywood movie that excels in the first category but languishes in the second. Ridley Scott is one my favorite directors of all time, and when I heard he was doing a movie on the Crusades I was quite excited. Ridley's directorial hand is as sharp as ever here, and he even does a great job of turning the bland Orlando Bloom into a believable leading man. One reason I like this type of movie (even if it isn't entirely historically accurate and clashes with my Christian worldview) is that it takes me to a time in human history that I've never been to, and gives a vivid portrayal of what life was like in the period of the early Crusades, with all the brutality and beauty that piece of human history entailed. Kingdom of Heaven is essentially about one man caught up in the Crusades who feels he must do his duty for the human cause. He defends Jerusalem against Saladin's Islamic army not because he wants to preserve the city's religious heritage, but simply because he wants to defend the people that live there. And this is the message of the movie in a nutshell: living according to the conscience that God put in you is far superior to living according to some fanatical religious creed. Both Christians and Muslims complained that they were not portrayed well in this movie, and for good reason. The overall message is that killing people in the name of God is not quite the best thing for humanity (which I would agree with, by the way). The problem is that it lumps the great majority of religious believers into this category.  The \\"good\\" Christians are not good because they liveaccording to the ways of Christ, but because they become disillusioned with religion itself.  The \\"kingdom of heaven\\" of the title is repeatedly referred to as a \\"kingdom of conscience.\\" So we shouldn't be seeking any manifested will of God on earth; the true kingdom of heaven consists in living rightly according to what is in your head in your heart. There are three factions in the movie, all apparently portrayed as something differently than their real life historical counterparts: the Knights Hospitaller (good Christians), the Knights Templar (bad Christians), and the Muslims (variously portrayed as noble or savage; it should be said that the immediate context for Saladin's attack on Jerusalem is a vicious attack by the Templars on innocent Muslims, but it is clear that he is seizing the opportunity to retake Jerusalem for Islam).  The Templars and their leader, Guy de Lusignan, are portrayed as the most vicious, however.  The Hospitallers are committed to living in peace with the Muslims because, after all, \\"their prayers sound like ours.\\"  The movie gets caught in this annoying Hollywood habit of correcting the mistaken worldviews of yesteryear with more enlightened views of 21st century western man.  Consider the lessons that the hero, Balian, learns:  (1) the really religious people are the most dangerous because they want to kill people that disagree with them and (2) the class system of lord v. laborer is not a very fair system.  I would certainly agree with the second lesson, but the problem with the first one is that they provide few alternative portrayals of devout believers.  Every single official Catholic character portrayed or discussed - a priest, a bishop, and the pope - are sniveling little men who want to shed Muslim blood for the glory of God.  After a bishop suggests to Balian at the point of defeat by Saladin that they ought to convert to Islam and repent later, Balian tells him sarcastically that he has learned a great deal from him about religion.  Why, instead of becoming disillusioned with Christianity, couldn't Balian have learned what true Christianity was about?  Why couldn't he have learned that religious tolerance in the civil realm is not incompatible with exclusivist personal beliefs?  Why indeed. <br /> <br />
B00097DXZS|5.0|A really great hour of music that features not only great collaborations (with, among others, Los Lonely Boys, Steven Tyler, Joss Stone, Mary J. Blige, Robert Randolph) but some terrific Santana-solo stuff.  Tracks like \\"Hermes,\\" \\"Con Santana,\\" \\"Just Feel Better\\" and \\"Trinity\\" are as good as anything this band has ever done.  Highly recommended!
0066620996|5.0|To me the beauty of this work is the enormous amount of examples that Jim Collins had cited in this book. As i've said before, Jim Collins had proved an author's way of Walking the Talk, by proving such marvellous business concepts and ideas through interesting business examples ( namely level 5 leaders who've shaped up great companies like; Darwin, Admiral Jim Stock Dale, Gillete, Philip Morris, Walgreens, Wells Fargo). <br /> <br />It's not only a MUST-READ book, but also a MUST-KEEP resource.
0553801503|4.0|So I finally finished A Feast For Crows... and yeah, it was a disappointment.  BUT the good news is Martin's worst book is still miles above what most people turn out.  I think the problem was simply that Martin was at a huge turning point after SOS and in deciding to ditch the five year gap (a necessary choice in my opinion) he got so caught up with aftermath that he loses the bigger picture. <br /> <br />Every epic story needs a strong focus - LOTR may take us across many lands with a huge cast of characters, but we always know there is one quest.  In ASOIF, the epic center is that a land which has lost its magic is suddenly confronted with the return of mystic forces - both as the Long Night in Winter and the birth of the dragons that will one day tame both winter and the political landscape.  We KNOW how the story ends.  Martin should be smart enough to KNOW we know.  Now the only question is how we get there. <br /> <br />The story of the Iron Islands will not get us there.  As other readers have pointed out, a bunch of misogynistic sub-Vikings are not interesting characters.  The story of Dorne, while linked into the greater story, is handled in a very patchy and undesirable way.  We get three DIFFERENT POVS for Dorne, all of which have totally different focuses and motivations, which makes that subplot patchy and irritating until LITERALLY the final page of it. <br /> <br />The other POVs could all use some serious editing, I agree. I enjoy the history, I enjoy the intrigue, I enjoy the subtlety, but these stories just become repetitive.  First, Cersei starts plots with characters we hate to kill characters we love.  Then, Cersei starts plots with characters we hate to kill characters we love. Ten pages later, Cersei starts... you get the point.  Cersei was NOT a good choice for a POV character, and I think this is what makes the book so unenjoyable.  She is the kind of character that works very well in small doses - that annoying witch you love to hate.  Butas half a book, her paranoid delusions and homecoming queen sluttiness just GRATE. <br /> <br />Jamie, who had turned into one of my favorite characters at the end of SOS, pretty much loses all the ground he had won becoming a mature character.  It's PAINFUL.  You want to slap him.  You want Brienne to drop her moping and come back and slap him.  I think he may have finally wisened up at the end of the book, but he flitters so often between trying to be his dad (why?  he rejected his dad ages ago?  did I miss something??) and being jealous of anything screwing Cersei that I really can't tell who he is anymore. <br /> <br />Brienne, came off better than I expected, although I wish her chapters had been made shorter to condense more in.  However the cliffhanger that she ends up in is so frustrating it makes you ACTUALLY AGREE WITH RANDALL TARLY.  You know something's up when that guy is making sense.  His son Sam's chapters are the same as Brienne's - a nice diversion yet overlong.  It's good to see Sam finally having to suck it in and be a man, but I would have preferred more arrival and less getting there. <br /> <br />The Starks are especially underrepresented in this book, which I think cuts off a certain amount of audience love.  Arya is barely there and when she is she's being asked to give up her name, which just seems cruel and unnecessary after all she's been through.  The boots thing is great, though.  Go Arya.  Sansa, on the other hand, has magically grown a brain through osmotic bonding with Petyr Baelish.  Not sure how she could go from cloying, naive, idealistic dimwit to conniving actress in the span of a few months, but hey, we get to see a lot of Petyr Baelish being amusingly manipulative, which is at least a respite from Cersei being heavy handedly manipulative. <br /> <br />I think the most frustrating thing is that GRRM has said he thinks he can tell the Jon, Tyrion, Daenerys, Stannis and Bran stories in about half the length of this book and usedthe rest of DOD to push the entire narrative forward.  Yet, these are the characters that are actually part of that grander scheme and these are the characters that are the focus of all of the future action.  So why waste an entire book on disposable characters (many of whom are duly disposed) and stint on the meat of the story arc?  It should be the other way around!  I can DEAL with twenty pages of Jon's tedium.  If GRRM wrote an entire page of Tyrion taking a fart, it would be FASCINATING because Tyrion is fascinating.  The peeps in FOC?  Not fascinating.  They're better than watching television, I grant you, but I put this book down a lot.  It didn't hold me the way the others did.  I laughed a lot, but I didn't really sympathize.  And I have to say, the peek chapter at the end of Danaerys' story line didn't exactly draw me in.   <br /> <br />I hope the rest of DOD proves more dynamic and puts us back on track to the story that matters.  For four books GRRM has told us that Winter is Coming.  But now it seems, winter is here.  So what is he going to do about it?
B00005JO17|5.0|Having seen the intriguing previews, I knew I had to go see `Chicken Little' as soon as it came out. After recently watching it, I can say that I really enjoyed the movie, regardless of what the critics are saying about it. <br /> <br />The story is about a young chicken called Chicken Little (voiced by Zach Braff), who witnesses a piece of the sky falling to the ground. However, when he warns the townspeople about it, the piece is missing. The people think that Chicken Little is crazy, and his father doesn't believe him either. He is made the laughing stock of his town, but Chicken Little is still determined to show everyone (especially his father) that he is not crazy or weak. His only friends are Abby (voiced by Joan Cusack), Runt (voiced y Steve Zahn), and Fish (voiced by Dan Molina) and with their help he manages to show everyone that he can be as good as anyone else. Unfortunately, after his popularity, he notices another piece of the sky falling, and this time, into his bedroom. Not knowing what to do, Chicken Little should now decide whether he should warn the people again with the fear of losing everything he is worked for, or keep quiet about it, even though he feels really uncomfortable about it.  <br /> <br />What's not to like in this movie? For the adults, we have an interesting story, sweet characters, touching moments, and a good laugh once in a while. For the children, there are colorful characters and funny moments, not to mention that it provides a good moral to them. Some people are criticizing the music in the movie. This is not a Disney musical like `Aladdin' or `Beauty and the Beast'; it is just a simple story, and just because it is from Disney doesn't mean that people should expect a wonderful soundtrack. Furthermore, I don't understand why people are comparing this to Disney-Pixar movies. I feel that Disney can make good movies, with or without Pixar, and `Chicken Little' proves that. The animation was as good as any other CGI animated movie that I had seen. <br /> <br />The cast also did a wonderful job in providing the voices for the characters. Zach Braff, Steve Zahn, Joan Cusack and Garry Marshall brought the characters to life, and should be credited highly for. Mark Dindal, who provided the visual effects for previous Disney movies like `The Little Mermaid' and `Oliver and Company', did a fine job in directing this movie. <br /> <br />All in all, I didn't find anything wrong with this movie, and if you liked movies like `Finding Nemo', I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this one.
0446310786|5.0|when i was assighned to read this book 4 years ago as a freshman in high school, everybody told me i would hate it. all my friends and upperclassmen i knew said to expect the worst. and after i read the book is when i decided i needed to be hanging around smarter more intellectual friends. the only way you could hate this book is if you're a stubborn immature high school student that would rather skip class than give a rat's but about your english class. the people that hated it were the ones getting \\"F\\"s and didn't want to read  anything other than the latest magazine or anime comic book. the story has so much to offer and i just wish all the young people (as if im so old) would open their hearts and minds to it.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Wow, what can you say. I'm currently watching and listering the DVD again. Listening with my eyes closes and sometime watching. This CD/DVD is quite amazing. Perfectional balance between musical performance, lyrics and voice. Steve at his best. They've really got their best out of them since a couple of years. Pure, with their own sound... I'm really amazed of how e'thing has come together in this album. This is one of the CD's that are in my top collection together with bands like for instance Pink Floyd. Keep on going Marillion. I'm proud of you!
B000AA305M|4.0|Lots of people say this is a copy protected CD that is released by Sony and won't install on an iPod. It plays on my iPod, in my ancient CD player and the CD says it's from iht Records Ltd. Does the British version not have the copy protection that you're all talking about or have I missed something? <br /> <br />Anyway, the album is great.
1573223026|4.0|Four people have a chance meeting on top of a building on their way to commit suicide by jumping off.  That is all they have in common, lives they perceive as so rotten that each of them believes that suicide is the best solution for each of them.  There are no great revelations here, and perhaps this is the theme of the stories of each of these people in the book.  Little things in life can be significant in turning a life, or the perception of a life, around. <br /> <br />There is humor here, and some strange happenings, but the book is not a downer, in spite of its first impressions.  Where there is life, there is hope, which is probably a bit of an oversimplification.  It is an enjoyable read. <br />

B0002KVULG|5.0|This is a wonderful film which I love immennsely and consider one of the best Dracula films made with Frank Langella supurb performance,is,however coded by the company to play badly on multi region DVD players.Of the three DVD players I own it will only play properly on one,on another it will only play in black and white and on the third not at all.This is extremely unfair on foreign customers as many of these films will never be released in our countries.I give the film itself five stars but the dirty tactics of the distributor disgust me they are only depriving themselves of custom they won't get otherwise
B0001HAHXW|4.0|No,its not angry, rough, \\"soulful,\\" rockin', \\"inspired,\\" haunting, tormented, etc.  It's not going to make you sit bolt upright or, for that matter, think much about Robert Johnson and his weird and haunted life.<br /><br />So why should you buy a cd of Clapton covering 14 songs, ie., 1/2 of the legendary Robert Johnson's output?<br /><br />Its just good straight pop product, that's all.  And Clapton's rich singing voice has never sounded finer, happier, than in his idea of delivering a quite respectful tribute to his continuing inspiration.  It's very cleanly recorded with mature yet fresh guitar, a very professional and straight up job.  Clapton wisely refrains from \\"acting\\" Robert Johnson or putting on any other stagehand show of blackface -- perhaps the subtlest and most genuine tribute.  If you want to hear Clapton when he was haunted in this manner, yeah, you've got to go way back to his own \\"White Room,\\" his youthful spooky attempt to embody in his own person the cryptic world of the blues.  Truth is, this may well be an album for older folk and Clapton might even admit as much.  Certainly there are better covers anywhere of any individual song.<br /><br />Fact is, the album is not boring or dull and rewards repeated listening.  Its not the sometimes seen lazy Clapton, either. He's obviously involved in what he's doing even if it sounds a tad academic, like a serious Blues 101 lesson from a professor.  The record gains from being understudied and while not something you will want to replay every day, will be a welcome relief when you need to slide something authentic into your cd changer.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|If the fight scenes were filmed, as said, from the victim's point of view, all I can say is the victim is the viewer. These are some of the most poorly edited and cramped fighting scenes I've ever seen in a major motion picture. What is going on in them is anyone's guess and there is certainly no thrill or excitement and anxiety built in any of them. Mostly, you, the victim/viewer, is trying to figure out what the hell is going on and who is beating up whom. But there are good things, to be sure, in this Batman, particularly Liam Neeson as Ducard, the mentor. Christian Bale has received major accolades for making Batman and Bruce three dimensional, but I was only partly behind his portrayal the entire way -- he certainly wasn't aided by some ridiculously stilted dialogue. In the modern series, this certainly is the most intellectually rich Batman, but the whole story of the Batman has been retold in variations and adventures for years and years, on and on. It has proven elastic, but I think the story is a phase fans relate to intensely, then either move on from, or forever wallow in its permutations. So, while the ardent point to this film and say, see, there is life left in the franchise! You could also say it's just been dressed up all over again. I did enjoy this film, but it's still hokey claptrap, and the fight scenes set it way back. I'm not walking away from Batman for good, yet, however. If they deliver more Cilian Murphy as Scarecrow, I just might find myself plunking down my money again.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When you read the reviews of other people, there is no doubt that you will get the impression that this might be the best album you could ever have, and it probably is. When I went to the record store, I originally wanted to buy \\"the bends\\", because of the title track, that was actually the song that introduced me to radiohead, I knew that songs like \\"high and dry\\", \\"street spirit\\" and \\"fake plastic trees\\" were amazing too but when I got to the record store they only had \\"OK computer\\", It definitely turned out for the best, because this CD is amazing, I actually tried to not like it but the songs grew on me, my personal favorites are \\"no surprises\\", \\"lucky\\" and \\"let down\\" and the song that made me say \\"I like radiohead!\\"(which not everyone could easily say because of the fear of being pretentious)has to be \\"airbag\\".
B00082IJ08|4.0|Today was my first introduction to the Gorillaz.  As a fan of all types of music from bluegrass to electronica, I found the Gorillaz hard to pin down as far as what genre of music they play.

There are better books out there and much better methods.<br /><br />In one of his seminars about 4 years ago he claimed his book \\"Millionaire Mind\\" was a bestseller. I didn't believe him (a gut feeling) and investigated: NOT! I told the groupie who nagged me to go to his seminar, her response was that of a deer caught in a headlight and she rushed to the table in the back (at the second seminar I went with her out of curiosity) and spent $3000 maxing out her credit card (deep financial debt due to a divorce) to go to some \\"warrior\\" training camp which he contracts out to some outfit. Needless to say she was of the \\"needy personality\\". She went to every one of his \\"free\\" seminars that he had when in town and would hover around the stage like a dazed & confused school girl -  it was surreal. He was supposed to make an appearance at his *paid* \\"warrior\\" training camp but was too busy \\"shaking the foundations\\" with his message. Yeah, right!<br /><br />Why did I go?

B000002J2F|5.0|2 years prior to this release was my first encounter with Genesis (being the double purchase of \\"And then there were three\\" and \\"Seconds Out\\". ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) were \\"my favourite band\\" at the time and I was looking for something a little \\"heavier\\". Well I never looked back. Both these Genesis releases I thought were incredible, especially Seconds Out with the magnificent \\"Suppers Ready\\". I really just couldn't wait for their next album (it seemed to be forever!) I remember buying the single from the \\"pre release\\" of Duke (\\"Turn it on again\\") and thinking, at first listen, how moments from it sounded a bit like our own Split Enz (a New Zealand band) who were riding strong with their \\"True Colors\\" album. After playing \\"Turn it on again\\" and trying to work out the drum pattern (not as simple as I had first thought!) the anticipation for the album was incredible ... each day checking... was it released yet! I remember buying this and Peter Gabriel's third album (\\"Melt\\") on the same day. (What a day that was!)    Duke rates as one of my all time favorite albums.     The opener \\"Behind the lines\\" (Banks, Collins, Rutherford) is a stunning, majestic and very uplifting piece of music. It is also very rocking piece with a very confident \\"swing\\" to it. (It just sounded so uplifting and fresh on the first listen and still does today). The drum sounds are very real and dynamic.  The move from this track to \\"Duchess\\" (Banks, Collins, Rutherford) is beautifully done. Duchess itself is a stunning track, so sad and so uplifting at the same time. Duchess then moves seamlessly into Guide Vocal (Banks) and this just overflows with emotion. These three tracks together clock in at over 13 minutes and they really are an epic that is right up there with any the bands earlier efforts. (These three need to be played as one track to gain the full impact of the music, it really is 13 minutes of fine rock music).      \\"Man of our times\\" is a great harder edged rock track - courtesy of Mike Rutherford.   \\"Misunderstanding\\" (Phil Collins) is a great pop / rock song, great hooks, great feel.   \\"Heathaze\\" (Tony Banks) is beautiful - a wonderful and typical Tony Banks track, very emotional, beautifully put together.   \\"Turn it on again\\" (Banks, Collins, Rutherford) is another great pop rock song, great hooks, great rhythm. A concert favorite for years.  \\"Alone Tonight\\" (Mike Rutherford), \\"Cul de Sac\\" (Tony Banks) and \\"Please don't ask\\" (Phil Collins) (this one is particularly moving) are three very strong and highly emotional, touching songs.     The album closes with another epic, \\"Dukes Travels / Dukes End\\" clocking in at over 10 minutes with some of the strongest rocking instrumental work the band has ever done. The closing vocals in Dukes Travels (a reworked \\"Guide Vocal\\") is so stirring, so emotional (yes I've used that word a few times here; it really sums up the album). Then the intro to Dukes End, in come the drums, a re-worked \\"Behind the Lines\\" and it's all happening, it just rocks! I remember playing it over and over again, it's just so good... a classic album closer which to me was the 80's equivalent of Dance on a Volcano / Los Endos from the mid 70's (Yes, it's that good). I think it would have come across very well live.    So, to summarise, for me this is a very emotional and \\"from the heart\\" album from Genesis, I really love it. It also marks the start of the 80's for the band and the members change in style... particularly (in my view) around lyrics and different song structures. Prior to this album Phil had done sideline work with Jazz-Fusion outfit Brand X, Tony had released his own solo excellent album \\"Curious Feeling\\" and Mike had done likewise with his superb \\"Smallcreeps Day\\" album. Somehow though when Phil, Mike got back together with Tony there was something special between them, a special magic. Duke shows this in abundance. Additionally, from a commercial point of view the collective output over the next decade or sofrom Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford (via Mike and the Mechanics) was nothing short of phenomenal, yet again when the three got back together again (for \\"Genesis\\" (1983), \\"Invisible Touch\\" (1986) and \\"We can't dance\\" (1991) the results were superb and their own \\"commercial\\" success grew exponentially.     For me, Duke is where all the years of refining their craft suddenly exploded. I take my hat off to Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford... congratulations; to me it's a timeless classic, 10 out of 10. (And if all this was not enough for a \\"anything to do with Genesis\\" fan during the 80's, some previous \\"Genesis talent\\" from the mid 70's (one Mr. Peter Gabriel) was also entering his most commercial period during the 80's - but that's another story). In fact so many artists who had strived to create new sounds in the 70's, seemed to have taken their 10 years or so worth of experiences and hard work to find themselves almost \\"re-born\\" in the 80's. (Genesis, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford (Mike and Mechx), Queen, Rush, ZZ Top, and Yes (amongst others) immediately spring to mind).    \\"Duke\\" - Quite simply one of my all time favorite albums. If you do get it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
0395389496|5.0|This book and story are just beautiful. I reread this book every Christmas and still enjoy the magical story of the Christmas bell from St. Nick. I love the message that Christmas is magical and special for children. The book is is also wonderful because of the pictures which Van Allsburg created. These pictures are so beautiful because they show the wamth of the train through the snow, and the excitement of the children aboard. The pictures make you feel that you are acknowledged as being on the express train, that you are in the presence of St. Nick, and that you are there when the boy recieves that bell. This book is just perfect for any child but I think its most special for adults who cherish their nostalgia and childhood when St. Nick existed for them
B000002B1M|4.0|Most artists will tell you that Nas is one of the greatest rappers ever. It Was Written is his sophomore effort, and it shows why most rap cats can agree on his status. \\"Street Dreams\\", and \\"Shootouts\\" are great albums for any fan of rap or hip-hop (YES, there is a MAJOR difference). \\"If I Ruled The World\\" is one of the most genius rap songs ever if you ask me. It gives a real feeling of the pain a young 'hood poet experiences over a sad, but addicting beat. Overall I love the vibe this album gives me. This is one of those albums you listen to while looking out your window, not one that you bump while crusin' around. It needs to be listened to with detail, and you need to let your mind go wherever when listening to it. I recommend blazin' a blunt and just leanin' on your window sill while you watch the folks in your own neighborhood. Classic stuff.
B00016ZQZM|5.0|This would eventually turn out to be the second last studio album of Queen but it is clear from the choice of material and subject matter of the tracks that they thought that this would be their swansong.  Tracks covering issues about various aspects of life from the womb to the tomb are here and especially the standout track \\"Those Were the Days of Our Lives\\", a track that still moves me whenever I hear it.  The rest of the album is also very good and I'd say that this ranks among Queen's top 5 albums ever.  This version is remastered although not that well but the mini-lp sleeve packaging is very nice to look at.  Highly recommended for all music fans, Queen or otherwise.
B0007Y08I8|2.0|Everyone had told me about how great this movie was, so I was really excited to see it - I have a very un p.c. sense of humor, and think that South Park is actually not too bad. (except it went over board with the whole AIDS thing, like Team America - that's one thing, along with rape and domestic violence that I think shouldn't be 'made' to be funny)However, this just wasn't funny at all. It was total potty humor - no intelligence at all. The only funny thing was the President of China's song - where every 'L' is pronounced 'R'.  <br />I give it two stars due to how well the puppets where handled, and the sets where great - it's visually amazing, so turn down the volume and you'll have a more enjoyable experience.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|I enjoyed the first Bridget Jones movie very much, even though it couldn't live up to the standards of the book and watched it again and again, but the sequel turned out to be so painful and tedious that it made me cringe in my seat both (!) times I was watching it.<br /><br />I couldn't understand for the life of me why the scriptwriters didn't thought it adequate to use the storyline and ideas of the 2nd BJ book \\"The Edge of Reason\\" - and a very good sequel at that - especially as it should have been based on the book, shouldn't it? I mean, Bridget's going to Thailand with Daniel (!) and Rebecca's turning out to be lesbian IS NOT included in the original story, to say the least.<br /><br />There are no  witty scenes to speak of, only exaggerated ones that are embarrassing and painful rather than funny. There is no plot to speak of and no funny dialogues. The characters are all back, but you just can't find  the reason why, as they aren't given any chance to act. However, the worst of all is that the scriptwriters hand in hand with the director succeeded in transforming (=destroying) Bridget's down-to-earth, honest, witty character into a brainless, idiotic blonde ninny. Neither her character, nor her looks are credible any more. The terrible hair and make-up and the fact that instead of gaining some weight to appear more attractive Ren&eacute;e Z simply got fat! didn't help much. Not mentioning the disadvantageous and uncharacteristic clothes that the real Bridget - knowing exactly her good and bad points - would never have worn!<br /><br />You simply can't see why such a great guy as Mark Darcy and even such a lousy, but charming Daniel Cleaver would be attracted to her.<br /><br />The whole film is just a waste of time!
B00005JNEI|3.0|Oscar-winner (\\"Bowling for Columbine\\") Michael Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is an agitation propaganda documentary. You'll probably like it or not depending if you support John Howard and George W. Bush. Moore's agenda leaves no room for complex analysis of the evidence he uses to support his point of view. Instead we are treated to a 112-minute long blame game.<br /><br />Moore's film is a scathing political attack on the presidency of George W. Bush. The blank, vague look on his face much of the time speaks volumes. Especially when on September 11 2001, after been told a second plane had struck the World Trade Centre, he sat for seven minutes in a Florida kindergarten, reading \\"My Pet Goat.\\" This footage was only available because the kindergarten teacher had her own video camera running.<br /><br />Much of the film is about the murky connections between the Bush family, the bin Laden family (Osama bin Laden's father was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia), and the Saudi royal family. Interspersed with his footage of the grim reality of war, even the Arab news channel Al Jazeera would have shied away from. You get to see the devastating effect of supposed smart weapons on Iraqi children in brutal detail.<br /><br />Although Moore himself didn't go to Iraq, there is also extensive coverage of the US troops there, operating in and around Baghdad. They are in turn scared, angry at been there, and pumped full of adrenaline at getting to play with very big, dangerous toys. One sequence shows a patrol ridiculing a hooded detainee, one man (unlike the prison guards at Abu Ghraib, he was smart enough to wear a balaclava) sexually humiliating the prisoner.<br /><br />One of the final powerful, though once again painful to watch, sequences was of grief stricken mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son Michael Pedersen had been killed in Iraq. His last letter home was full of anger at Bush, saying \\"He got us here for nothing whatsoever.\\" In tears outside the Whitehouse a Bush supporter tells her she should be blaming Al Qaeda for the death of her son.<br /><br />Much of this information is not new, but just isn't presented clearly by the news media. Here it is packaged in a way, has clearly sparked heated debate amongst Americans. A filmmaker who wasn't Michael Moore probably could have handled the material more deftly, and with much less hatred, but Moore gets across his anger to you. You will leave the cinema feeling like having a long talk with John Howard about getting the troops back now.h supporter tells her she should be blaming Al Qaeda for the death of her son. <br /> <br />Much of this information is not new, but just isn't presented clearly by the news media.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|The ultimate zombie masterpiece that will never lose it's edge. Dawn Of The Dead is still one of the best films of all time, and this ultimate edition is a must have. <br /> <br />With 3 different versions of the film.

0689859414|5.0|If you are a fan of Brian Froud you will love DiTerlizzi  His artwork is very remminescent of Froud. The images of faeries in this book are primaryl based of fae mentioned in the spiderwick chronicals however even if you never read them this is a book any fantasy/lore/faerie fan will enjoy. From small brownies, trolls, unicorns, griffins and more the art work alone is a treasure. For the Spiderwick fan it details little tidbits about each charecter and the lore. Though the lore doesn't follow as closley to traditional faerie (some is very close and some is his own interpritations) it follows the book closley. I am 24 and getting a copy for myself and my son. DiTerlizzi has made a fabulous move from magic cards to children/adult books and found his true calling.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil Young's career has been punctuated by a stubborn earnestness which, while occasionally soliciting the disparagement of critics, has resulted in some of the most heartwarming and awe-inspiring music of the 20th century. \\"Prairie Wind\\" finds Young in familiar territory...gentle guitar arrangements accompanied by subtle yet effective instrumentals. Lyrically, \\"Prarie Wind\\" is certainly indicative of a man who has recently confronted his own mortality (Young recently recovered from a brain aneurysm) and is quite content with bittersweet ruminations on the past, present, and future. \\"The Painter\\" sets the tone for what is to follow: \\"It's a long road, behind me...it's a long road, ahead...if you follow every dream, you might get lost.\\" <br /> <br />Young has consistently displayed an uncanny ability to make the bucolic feel perfectly contemporary; to make the mundane seem extraordinary. In other person's voice, the chorus to \\"Far From Home\\" could be rendered nearly intolerable, but Neil's absolute sincerity warms the soul during the most uptempo arrangement on the album. \\"Bury me out on the prairie, where the buffalos used to roam,\\" complete with a brass accompaniment, doesn't seem conveyed as overly idyllic. \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\" is an understated, nearly whispered love song. The standout \\"It's a Dream\\" is another gentle folk number with hauntingly ambiguous lyrical content...the first verse finds Neil comforting someone after a nightmare with his \\"it's only a dream\\" mantra, the subsequent verses seem to utilize the same lyrics as a lamentation. Such ambiguity is prevalent throughout the album; the \\"prairie wind\\" can alternately be the subject of Neil's sentimental journeys to his childhood, or a forboding presence of hopelessness and confusion in \\"No Wonder\\" (with amazing vocal harmonies). <br /> <br />\\"Prairie Wind\\" finsihes with one of the most phenomenal songs of Neil Young's career. \\"When God Made Me\\" is simultaneously a testament to Neil's belief in human equality and an ironic diatribe against religious persecution and bigotry in a post-September 11th world. Accompanied by piano and a choir, \\"When God Made Me\\" is flawless; an absolute stunner. <br /> <br />Despite the self-indulgence of \\"He Was The King\\" (a song that finds tenous placement on the album), \\"Prairie Wind\\" is easily one of the best entries in Young's catalog...certainly his most rewarding and comforting work of the last 20 years. Sparse yet challenging, simple yet full of meaning, \\"Prairie Wind\\" will stand the test of time.

B00005JOMY|4.0|\\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" is so full of energy and forward propulsion that it often trips over its own frenzied notions and plot machinations. This is screenwriter (\\"Lethal Weapon\\") Shane Black's first film as director and he is very keen on making the most of this opportunity: the 3rd wall is smashed and cleared away, the story is told both in flash backs and in flash forwards and Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart narrates in deadpan fashion that manages to be extremely witty and droll on the one hand and banal and silly at others.<br /><br />\\"KKBB\\" opens with an explosion of activity in which Harry a petty thief, while in the process of a robbery and running from the police, accidentally bursts into a room in which actors are being auditioned for a movie dealing with private eyes. He is thrust into service as an auditionee and is asked to screen test...moving closer to actually nabbing the movie role. And so it goes: one incredible and often hilarious plot twist after another.<br /><br />Downey, always a charming performer and who may be a bit too old for this part, in that he is supposed to be the same age as the smart, funny and adorable Michelle Monaghan who plays his childhood friend, Harmony Faith Lane...a great name, by-the-way. But be that as it may, the interplay between Monaghan and Downey as well as that with Val Kilmer as Gay Perry, a gay P.I. (I kid you not) is priceless: all are operating on the very highest level of their performing careers.<br /><br />Not every thing works in \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" but at least Black, by way of his throw in everything but the kitchen-sink style of directing, exhibits the cojones to play with the conventions of the detective story/thriller movie and make it work...most of the time: you must often risk the ridiculous in order to achieve the sublime is a lesson that Black has seemed to have learned very well.

1594200653|5.0|The three main themes of this account of postwar Europe is the death of ideology, the role individuals in shaping history, and the birth of the European Union and a new way of life that rejects the extremes of Soviet Communism and American Capitalism. Tony Judt makes the case that the era of political ideologies was ending in the last half of the twentieth century. In Western Europe the birth of the welfare state and the combining of the left and right on various issues resulted in the end of the political extremism. While in Eastern Europe, Communism was unable to reform itself as seen in the failed uprisings in Hungary and Czechosolvakia ending in its final collaspse in the period from 1989 to 1991. Moreover the repression of the Communist regimes combined with their economic mismanagement soiled the reputation of Communism in both Eastern and Western Europe. Despite these faults, Judt mantains that it was Gorbachev and his reforms which resulted in the fall of Communism. Judt's view of Gorbachev supports his thesis about the role of individuals in shaping history. Judt writes that Stalin in implementing harsh Communist governments throughout Eastern Europe discouraged Western European nations from pursuing a neutral course during the start of the Cold War. While Juan Carlos in Spain was able to transform Spain from being an authoritrain country into a democracy. Finally Milosevic and not any organized nationalist ideology helped to enflame the Serbs into committing war crimes in Bosnia during the nineties. The third theme of this book is the growth of the European Union that started as customs union for agricultural goods and then unifed its monetary policy in the seventies which resulted in a common currency in 1999. Tony concludes his book by stating that the European Union now promotes a new way of life that secures a free first class education and healthcare for its citizens and has strong safety net for the unemployed and elderly. The only weakness of this book is that Judt ignores other areas of European partnership such as Airbus and the European Space Agency, and he doesn't spend enough time in writing about the Muslim populations in Western Europe and their problems with assimilating into a secular society.

B00004Z459|5.0|I got this cd about 2 weeks after it originally launched which was like 5 years ago and im finally here to review it. <br /> <br />Papercut: 9/10 - I like this song alot, it starts the cd out with original Linkin Park style, very good. I like towards the end where it gets a little emotional. Great openner. <br /> <br />One Step Closer: 8/10 - Wasn't the biggest fan of the song, thought it was pretty cool though, definately not their best song but definately not skippable. <br /> <br />With You: 11/10 - One of my favorite songs on the cd, my first favorite song. I love it, it just sounds so Linkin Park, i love it. <br /> <br />Points of Authority: 5/10 - Probably the only song I dont really care for on the cd, never have. <br /> <br />Crawling: 9/10 - One of the harder Linkin Park songs. Pretty cool song, love the music video. <br /> <br />Runaway: 10/10 - Another one of favorite songs on the cd, was the second song I ever loved on the cd. I used to hear it on the radio all the time. Trully good. <br /> <br />By Myself: 9/10 - Pretty cool song, has good lyrics and sounds very like Linkin Park.  <br /> <br />In The End: 9/10 - O PLEASE STOP PLAYING IT ON THE RADIO!! I loved this song when i got the cd but when they started playing it on the radio, there was no end. Good song. <br /> <br />A Place in my Head: 9/10 - Good song, like the guitar in the very beginning. <br /> <br />Forgotten: 10/10 - Couldn't stop playing this song for about a week cause i loved it, again another favorte. <br /> <br />Cure for the Itch: 7/10 - I dont know how to review it, its just Mr. Han or however rappin. Pretty cool but only cool to listen to once or twice. <br /> <br />Pushing Me Away: 10000/10 - My all time favorite song on the cd, liked it right before it was put on the radio.

B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers have a highly developed sound, especially for their debut, and every song screams with it. The hauntingly good synthesizer with some seriously intoxicating bass lines that you just can't hold back lined up with the polished, pink champagne, classy, rock guitar and drums that just won't stop; (don't dare call this barely \\"keeping the beat\\"). Every sound and instrument they use seems to become luminescent. This is heart clenching, blissful, delirium inducing stuff, it could kill you.  <br />Track by track: 'Jenny was a friend of mine' with the distressing lyrics with inescapable toxic bass line, is a brilliant, dramatic opening to the euphoric melodies that follow. Then you're immediately into their eminent hit 'Mr. Brightside' its still as good as ever with the charismatic guitar. 'Smile like you mean it' needs no begging for compliance, you might've not thought they'd be able to keep it up after Mr. Brightside but these guys don't stop. 'Somebody told me' will still dizzy you up with all its dynamics. 'All these things I have done' will have you convinced even with the (well fitted) gospel choir. 'Andy you a star' definitely earns its plaque on the wall to line the hall. 'On top' is exactly that, vivacious and quite irresistible makes you wish you could play a synthesizer. 'Change you're mind' carries the great vibe from 'on top' and my mind needs no changing to readily drink in the infectious progressive melody. 'Believe me Natalie' displays more dulcet tones, definitely a charmer. 'Midnight show' is a very climactic, alluring, frenzy. `Everything will be alright' ends the album with the trademark synthesized sound quite a dreamy end to the narcotic album leaving you comatose.  <br /> The only thing that could be criticized is perhaps the slightly noxious lyrics. These are Las Vegas boys with their neon lighted stories but you can see its extent in radio releases. I don't think it's too exaggerated but nor is it minimized they're honest with it. If youever got psyched up over their radio releases you can up the dosage with their album. If you don't like one of these songs the first time round it's because you missed something. The whole album never lets up; it consistently delivers exhilarating yet distinctive tracks in the sensual compilation. <br />
B000B2YQX4|2.0|I've been a DM fan for a lil over 3 years now. Since I've had all this time to catch up on the more recent albums from Violator on through Exciter, I've been really hooked on their sound from the 90s. Although, I respect bands that try to evolve with the times as DM has demonstrated on numerous occasions, I feel Playing the Angel was a huge let down as far as the energy of their sound goes. Yes Exciter was not one their best outings either, but it did have some great standout tracks to compensate for the lack of its overall depth. With Playing the Angel, it feels like I have to force myself to really like several of the tracks on it, aside from Precious which is just fantastic. It just seems like every track has the same pace and sound, ultimately being too slow and unimaginative. The album had great potential, but the boys just felt like writing the same song over and over.  <br />I hope they do better on the remixes to this album, because PTA just doesn't have the swagger compared to their other albums Ultra, Violator and SOFAD.  <br /> <br />
B000AADYUI|5.0|I suppose I just have to get used to the fact that I'm going to be \\"out of touch\\" with the value system of the 2000s or oughts or whatever we're calling this dark decade. All I know is when I go back and listen to albums like this, I can't help but think the 1960s and very early 1970s did means something, until, that is, the corporate hogs of the 1980s and on up decided it was all nonsense. <br /> <br />Yeah, well, here's one aging hippie who's still willing to stand up for peace, love and granola ... or in this case a science-fiction rock opera that was one of the best things Paul Kantner ever put together. Musically, there's much to admire here, from the burbling opening notes of \\"Have You Seen the Stars Tonite\\" to Jack Casady's absolutely monstrous (if under-recorded) bass on \\"Starship.\\" <br /> <br />But it's the lyrics, the concept, the ideas that still grab me. And yes, the values: Community, solidarity, commitment, imagination. I just wish there really were a starship to board, and a better place to steer it toward. But the album works equally well as metaphor: That better place is EARTH, folks, and I personally think it's high time we changed course -- and captains, too, while we're at it. If I thought Kantner would run for higher office, I'd vote for him. Too bad he and Slick aren't married anymore; she'd make the most interesting first lady in American history. Ha!
B00005JM4Z|5.0|ARE YOU CRAZY????????? <br />This movie is great. I love boy racers and I wish I was old enough to drive so I could be one too! Oops, I'm a girl! OK, I could be a girl racer! But, boy racers or girl racers, this movie is da bomb! It's in a class of its own. My Dad loves car and motorbike racing. He saw the first five minutes and switched it off, saying it was stupid. Big mistake. Luckily, I recorded it so he can still watch it and see how wrong he was about it having no story! Of course it has a story, it just needs a bit more time than five minutes to really get into full swing! I loved the fast cars, and I can hardly wait to see the first one (hope it's just as good)! <br /> <br />Just remember not to take part in Street Races on busy roads, and try to be as safe as possible. For, not only could you get caught, or get your car impounded, but you could also kill or injure yourself, or someone else, or wreck your car. <br /> <br />But as long as you don't take it TOO seriously it's a great film. And I'm not saying don't street race. I'll bet it'd be great fun and I can hardly wait to do it myself! I'm just saying, be careful, be safe, and don't do it if you're drunk or stoned. <br /> <br />But hey, enough of that! Let's now focus on the GOOD points. <br /> <br />OK, so I suppose you're wondering what I'm talking about. Well, I'll tell you. 2 Fast 2 Furious is about some guys who take part in a street race. They get caught and they are promised clean records IF they help the police with another crime. Well, the criminals say that if they don't help them, they'll make up so many stories about them breaking the law they'll go to Jail. But if they do help them, they'll die. Well, they try to look like they're helping them when they're actually helping the police. Much mirth ensues. <br /> <br />If you haven't already seen it, get down to the nearest video ezy and get one today! Satisfaction guaranteed! <br />You'll love it if you liked The World's Fastest Indian, Herbie: Fully loaded (the old OR the new version), The Fast And The Furious (Duh! It's the first in the series!), or any other car/motorbike racing film.  <br /> <br />So what're you waiting for? HIRE ONE TODAY!
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Thee are three kinds of Neil Young albums: the Crazy Horse ones, the country rock ones, and the \\"other\\" ones.  For the most part his masterpieces fit into the first two categories (although Old Ways, pure country, and This Note's for You, swing, were aces in the \\"other\\" vein.)<br /><br />Prairie Wind is another in a long line of great Neil country rock albums.  It isn't Harvest or Harvest Moon, but it is of a piece with these, as it is with Comes a Time and Silver and Gold.  Here Young is confronting mortality, and if he sounds older, well, that's because he is.<br /><br />Personally I don't think the Elvis nod is goofy at all; not from the guy who famously invoked Johnny Rotten.  Neil has always been a complex and confoundng artist; that's why he has enjoyed such longevity.  His work has been hit or miss this decade (Greendale a major hit; Are You Passionate, not so much.)  But Prairie Wind is a bullseye.  If you've been enjoying a running dialogue with the guy from After the Goldrush, Harvest, Comes a Time, Hawks and Doves, Harvest Moon, and Silver and Gold, he's back.  Different, but the same.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|I went and saw this movie in the theaters and was rather disappointed. I know that the old Albus had died and I couldn't change that, but they could have made the new one look more like the old Albus. I was also disappointed in how they didn't stay with the same castle grounds as in the first and second movies. It's very obvious. I also thought that lupin didn't look like he was suposed to and sirius looked too old. When I started watching the movie more and now I think they did a good job casting, but I still feel strongly about my first two concerns.
B000001E18|3.0|I have to give credit to U2 for being creative and developing different styles in their music.  Achtung Baby is a true classic recording.  However, the band decided to experiment with techno beats and spooky synthesizer and guitar effects.  And you know what, it works somewhat.<br /><br />Through all the catchy stylings, the songs are a bit hit and miss.  I like the title track, Lemon, The Wanderer, and several others.  However memorable melodies are a little bit thin.  Nonetheless, this is a groove oriented recording and I can certainly appreciate what it brings to the table.  Just do not make this the first CD you own by U2.
B0000019PA|5.0|We've had avant garde musicians such as Steve Reich and Sonic Youth, but after that music seemed to be lacking in any remarkable locomotion.  Nirvana seemed to be a change, but was rather an extension.  Neutral Milk Hotel changed music completely for their listeners.  Not only in the originality that's found in their zanzithophones or compositions, but the real jewel here are the lyrics.  I hear a lot of people listen to grunge bands like Bush and label it genius.  However, NMH is indubitably artful, using elements of surrealism and abstract metaphors.  Jeff Mangum proves to be one of the greatest lyricists of all time, seen from his James Tate-like imagery, and In The Aeroplane is a real and rare paragon of modern music.
B000BBYMA2|4.0|[The following is for the review of the 2 disc special edition DVD version of Battle Royale]<br /><br />First off let me start off by saying that all together this is a great film, with some kick butt action sequences, awesome plot, cool twists along the way and just a downright awesome feel. However, there are a number of things which take away from the film's overall powerful appeal (and overall quality).<br /><br />One of the major problems with the film is that it comes across as \\"dark humor\\" or \\"slapstick\\" in many ways (the awkward music playing while someone is getting their head bashed in with an axe), and dead people getting up and talking just make the film come across as \\"amusing.\\" But wait, that isn't to say this movie, is a comedy at all and that isn't to say comedy is a bad thing (especially here)!<br /><br />I'm half sure the \\"dark humor\\" aspects of the film were designed to make it a \\"cult classic\\" and appeal to large audiences in much the same way other dark humor type films have in the past. Likewise, if taken for what it is in conjunction with some of the gruesome aspects of the film as well as the interesting storyline, it leads (in my opinion) to a very neat film (if not a strong one).<br /><br />One reviewer said that the film was \\"disturbing.\\" I'm going to have to disagree simply because of the slapstick nature in which brutal killings take place throughout the movie (sure if you have a weak heart you might find the film overbearing at times, but I certainly didn't). Are the murders senseless and without style? No, in fact the style literally is the dark humor, as cheesy as that is when we are asked to take the storyline seriously at times.<br /><br />So all and all the humorous aspects in the film both take away from it as well as provide a backdrop for much of the brutality throughout the film. Recently I've heard a number of American reviewers mention that the problem is that the film is both a foreign film as well as a low budget film - these two can be contributing factors as many Americans who rent the film on Netflix and or at their video store are certainly under the impression they are about to watch a \\"serious\\" film (whether or not this is thought exclusively by Americans I do not know, perhaps the film was marketed similarly in Japan).<br /><br />For the reasons previously mentioned this cannot be considered a \\"serious film,\\" rather perhaps it can be considered a \\"strange/good film\\" in that it is too humorous to be serious and too serious to resemble a comedy in the slightest (and yes I think that unfortunately means people will either like it or hate it for what it is).<br /><br />The end of the films suffers from poor subtitle translations as well as an overly \\"exhausted\\" feeling. Closure of the film occurs 5 minutes before the actual film's end, the actual ending is full of useless images of the film's characters playing together (giving us even more useless images of how bad it was that friends were fighting with each other as well as how some of the individuals lived secluded lives, perhaps lending to some kind of rationality for why they gave into violence as they had).<br /><br />I'm going to have to disagree with any sort of opinion that says major psychological themes played a large role in the movie. Certainly they were there (it would be foolish to ignore them completely), but given the slapstick way in which the movie was handled at times it seems as though they were dulled throughout most of the movie and only resurrect themselves later at the film's \\"actual ending.\\"<br /><br />All and all this is a great film as I mentioned earlier. I would have actually liked the film to focus more on the psychological trauma perhaps felt by the youngsters throughout the film. Unfortunately I believe it fails to do this and it leaves it up to the audience to decide whether or they want to place a strong emphasis on such things when recalling the film long after watching it.<br /><br />Again, great film that should have taken itself a bit more seriously in my opinion - I love and accept it for what it is though, and I feel that a large majority of viewers will feel the same. Try it today!br /> <br />Again, great film that should have taken itself a bit more seriously in my opinion - I love and accept it for what it is though, and I feel that a large majority of viewers will feel the same.

B000022TSW|4.0|For anyone with a puerile sense of humor, this movie is sacred.  It get better with each viewing.  The vulgar, blasphemous songs are catchy- guaranteed to make you smile.  Little one-liners, while totally inappropriate to repeat, are so funny even your (well, at least my) parents laugh.  The satirical plot works on has something that everyone can relate to- even if only to be offended by it. Regular viewers and those without cable will enjoy it.   <br /> <br />It's a shame, then, that the DVD does not have more features to offer.  I am one of those losers that actually listens to the commentaries, but there isn't one here, and this would be perfect.  Even a little intro from Matt and Trey- I love the old video tapes!  Guess I'll have to make do with my imagination.  Uh, yeah. . .
B0001EFTVA|1.0|For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.<br /><br />This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.<br /><br />Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. \\"A Christmas Story\\" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.<br /><br />Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of \\"odd fellow\\" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).<br /><br /> I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.<br /><br />The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to \\"cling\\" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.<br /><br />Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again.

0553573403|5.0|After I finished A Game of Thrones, I was literally in awe.  This book is so tremendous that is an injustice to try and put into so many words how great it is.<br /><br />Finally, a book for the mature that contains incredible drama, amazing twists, great romance, and some tremendous action.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I didn't really like this album. \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" got so much radio play, it was just damn annoying. \\"American Idiot\\" was pretty good, I thought. But now I think they've released \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" which I think is a mistake. Isn't that song like 9 minutes long? \\"Wake me up when september ends\\" wasn't all that bad. And my favourites off the whole album were Give Me Novacaine, and St. Jimmy. <br />The rest of the songs I found weren't that great. And those really long songs (Jesus of Suburbia, Homecoming,) I find to be VERY long and boring.   <br />If you like Greenday, I recommend their album \\"International Super Hits.\\" This has all...or at least most of their singles..before this album. <br /> <br /> <br />
0553106635|5.0|A Storm of Swords is by far and away, the greatest book that I have ever read in my life. <br /> <br />Martin is a genius, plain and simple.  He weaves intricate multiple plots, all equally intriguing.  He is incredibly graphic and detailed in his writing, and all of his characters are fair game.  This book and this series has everything that you could hope for as an avid reader.  It is Martin's pull-no-punches style of writing that places him as the greatest fantasy writer alive today. <br /> <br />Overall, this is IMO the greatest fantasy book ever written.  If you have heard of this series(even if you have not) and have not yet read it, SHAME ON YOU. <br /> <br />I have just received my \\"Feast For Crows\\" through the mail courtesy of Amazon, and I am eager to dive right in.  I will be back to review it once I finish.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Who would've known? That this album rocks. After hearing \\"Hysteria\\" I just had to pick it up. I was not disappointed! With songs like Sing For Absolution, Blackout, Falling Away With You, and basically every song on the album, is just...magnificent! I absolutely love the song Blackout. The lead singer's voice is amazingly full of emotion. Never can get bored of this album. Always sounds new when I put it on.  <br />Great! Highly recommended.
0553108034|5.0|This is another tremendous book by George RR Martin.  It's not as good as the first in the series, but it was still the easily the Fantasy Novel of the year.(For the year that it was published)  That says something about the talent of George RR Martin.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|I rated the series, not the dvds so, please! Can someone whom actually bougth the dvds, tell me if Rising is part of this set???<br /><br />Aside of that. I think if you haven't watched a series on tv (any series), you could do a big mistake buying a set of dvds of a show you may hate.<br /><br />I think SGA is excellent, and I can't wait to buy every season from now on (like I've bought Stargate-SG1 among other series and movies). But that's just my opinion. No matter how good or bad the writting, the characters, the conflicts on the series are, what finally matters is that you feel you want to watch it over and over, or not.<br /><br />Unless you trust someone else opinion with all you heart, I suggest you watch any show, or movie, before buying it.<br /><br />Claudia
1416909532|5.0|A direct honest eyeopener for women to understanding male behavior. At least for me it was. Recognizing that you set your own standard for how you expect to be treated and hold to that. Expect that he should treat you well and don't wait around if he doesn't. Find someone who is going to treat you well, is going to keep his word, is going to call when he says he is going to call. There is no excuse for bad manners and bad behavior. And only you can decide how much of that you will allow in your life.  This book really helped me clarify men's dating behaviors (which looking back should have been obvious, but for some obscure reason it was not) and helped me be more self confident so instead of agonizing over why he was not calling, I knew why. He just wasn't that in to me. And I can live with that. :) Very empowering!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|\\"Oh, Depeche Mode / look what you 've done / You filled my heart / with pure emotion / in the name of fun!\\"    Hmm, excuse me for messing with the lyrics of OH LILIAN, but, my God, this is perhaps THE best DM song EVER! The melody is superb, the lyrics fit perfectly, the rhythm takes you away...    Well, we all know by now that Martin Gore is one of the finest composers of highly artistic pop music in the last quarter of the century. But, really, I didn't expect DM to reach these heights in 2005! In my humble opinion this album is almost flawless, and, at the moment, my favorite DM album. Of course time will tell if this is the best or whatever, but anyway it stands up there with the finest.  I think we should judge the album as a fulfiller of the concept \\"Pain and Suffering in various tempos\\", which is the subtitle in the back cover. In that perspective, even...  ...INTROSPECTRE is not just \\"some noises\\" here and there, but a nice theme that implies, well, introspection, especially after...  ...NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE, a track of very strong feeling. I must admit that I was a bit sceptical in the beginning about Dave Gahan's ability to write songs that could stand side to side with Gore's magic touch. But, to my surprise, after repeated listening of the album, his three songs with their simplistic and kind of \\"loose\\" approach in music and lyrics, seem to complement really well with  Gore's precise and tight writing. I could even say that Gahan brings some fresh tone of innocence in the (musically) \\"mature\\" Gore-world! NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE is my favorite Gahan song, though...  ...I WANT IT ALL has also a nice sit-back feeling which leads evenly to the strong statement of the next song, with Gahan's vocals drowned in delay, and...  ...SUFFER WELL is more catchy, with an interesting key change in the chorus. Of the other Gore songs, what can I say? What can you say about a  man in his mid forties who admits in...  ...A PAIN THAT I'M USED TO that \\"I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymore\\"? An excellent DM song that introduces ideally the album's concept with the statement \\"Just give me a pain that I'm used to\\" (really, what a statement!!!) and the penetrating, almost \\"painful\\" heavy-guitar-like sounds in the beginning. Reminding of \\"Personal Jesus\\" musically,...  ...JOHN THE REVELATOR (\\" -all he ever gives us is pain!\\") raises the fist to the absoluteness of the prophet! A really funny song (this way I get it) which touches of course a not funny at all religious matter. With its lurking rhythm,...  ...THE SINNER IN ME is another fine Gore song, and, of course...  ...PRECIOUS is just beautiful, even more beautiful in the context of the album, as some other reviewer also pointed. I want here to really stand for two rather underrated songs:...  ...MACRO with its almost soundtrackish, odd sounds and keys and brilliant chorus is a song written in a moment of ... \\"heightened awareness\\" and, in a sense, makes an interesting contrast with the following two more \\"innocent\\" Gahan songs. On the other hand,...  ...DAMAGED PEOPLE is such an emotional song... Don't be fooled by the absence of a strong rhythm: this song is not a \\"ballad\\" (as some others said), but a glorious, almost anthemic melody which reminds us that, as damaged as we may be, we can still have the love and intimacy to believe that \\"the world makes sense\\"... One of my favorites... Finally, though at first I thought that...  ...THE DARKEST STAR was not so special, now I think that it's an effective way to conclude such a passionate album: the rhythms are held back, the emotions deflate, and, oh you dark one, I don't want you to change!    Hillier's production is fabulous throughout. The sounds are \\"hard\\"  and warm at the same time (!), the programming flawless, the mixing and execution of Dave's vocals effective.    What can I possibly say. This album is a must. Not only for DM fans. For everyone.
B0009XE9UK|5.0|Together with the first one, this second album of the Doors shows the band in it's most wellknown period and sound. You can call it the basic Doors. When Morrison sings in Strange Days: `we shall go on playing or find a new town', I always think of Paris were I've seen his grave on Pre La Chaise. The playing had stopped; he found a new town were his playing stopped definitively... (When you're on the graveyard his grave isn't hard to find. You just follow the marks other Doors-fans left to show you the way.)  <br />Strange days is one of my favourite Doors-songs because of the way the strangeness of life in a great combination of music and lyrics is brought to us. Especialy when the song is played we have to agree: this certainly is the strangest life we've ever known. The album has more moments with that nice touch of melancholic filosophy. <br />There are some down to earth songs on the record too: You're Lost Little Girl and Unhappy Girl are typical Doors-songs about love/women with a little twist. Love Me Two Times is a nice little blues with the small touch of male-ignorance a good blues should always have: `one for tomorrow and one just for today'. Moonlight Drive is maybe not as striking as some other Doors-material, but it has a very consequent metafore in it. (Lesser Gods on the poetic stage tend to forget what  metafore they using halfway their lyrics.) As a not native speaker I liked to sing along with the `going down'-part at the end of the song with a low voice, without thinking about what it meant. Well, let's put it like this: when they've managed to swim to the moon and climb to the sky, they have to come down again. Morrison was a decent man. <br />Horse Latitudes is more poetry and free-`jazz' than rock. The contrast of down-to-earth (blues) material and the `stranger' music that is typical for all Doors-albums is very much present on this album. Horse Latitudes is placed between the two earlier mentioned blues songs. <br />The almost simplesounding song People Are Strange has the same contrast. The music is very happy but when you take the lyrics seriously there's nothing happy about this song. It's wellknown: <br />`people are strange, when you're a stranger <br />faces look ugly when you're alone <br />women seem wicked when you're unwanted <br />streets are uneven when you're down' <br />You should compare the lyrics to L'America of the album L.A. Woman (see my review).  <br />`friendly strangers came to town <br />all the people put them down <br />but the women love their ways <br />come again some other day' <br />At least the women started to like the unwanted. <br /> <br />The two lovesongs that follow have the same theme but they contradict eachother in a way. I'm talking about My Eyes Have Seen You and I Can't See Your Face In My Mind. The lyrics are still allright considering the fact that they're just two lovesongs. <br />But then something happens. Manzarek digs deep inside his organ and there it is: When The Music's Over. Another song of great theatrical suspence and terribly good lyrics. Songs like this had never been done before, exept by the Doors themselves in The End. The tension in this song reaches it's highest point when the music dies out and we `hear a very geantle sound'...'we want the world and we want it...'   <br />Since I know songs like this exist, I've been looking for them. There's not much around. I found one band that can play the same trick on me as The Doors did when I was about 15 years old. There an instrumtal band tough. A jazzband from Scandinavia, called the Esbjorn Svensson Trio. See them live and find out what I mean. They're coming to America soon. Great pianojazz with large themes and mystical enchanting rythms and compositions with heavy parts and still parts, freaky things and clean things, sweeping you off your feet. <br />
B000002U82|5.0|For every fan of this magnificent quartet this album inspires a different view of the same strange vibe. How could an album recorded over 30 years ago, remain so pertinent to every generation of music lovers? I can only sum it up in the following words... My parents love it and they're in their 60's. I, of course have grown up listening to it played on the radio and on every jukebox during my bar hopping days. And now my son at 3 years old can't seem to put it away. Requesting to listen to it every time we get into the car for a trip to a store. The music needs no explanation as it is as beautiful as it is complex, and every person who has ever heard a song from this record ends up buying it for their collection. A new generation has discovered this gem and I for one can relate to the first time I heard it and still have it in my repretoir of cd's I play without and end in sight.  <br /> The sound is clean, the music is awesome, Thought I'd something more to say...
B000002I25|5.0|This album is regarded as one of the best debut-albums ever made. Probably correct. There haven't been a lot of bands with a song as charismatic as The End on their first album. The album shows the Doors for what they were musically and lyrically.  <br />A little bit of criticism is at it's place bacause the album has it's weaker moments. The Doors got better over the years and this album has a fierce sound (that is typical for that period of the history of recording studio's) and not every song does as much to you as The End does. I believe that not even the still living Doors would disagree about that. But let's focus on the best parts of the album, because it's an album everybody with an interest in music and poetry should own. <br />The best songs on the album are Break On Through (To The Other Side), The Crystal Ship, Light My Fire and The End. These songs are of such unbelievable high level for a debut-album that it's not strange that there are so little new bands reaching the level of the Doors-debut. If you compare this album to the first one of the Beatles or the Stones (hail to both!) you must agree: this one says a lot more. <br />The album has the high flying guitar, the mystic running groovy organ, the great free jazzy drumming and the poetic strength the Doors are famous for. <br /> <br />Something about two of the songs: <br />Break On Through (To The Other Side):  In poetry there are some programatic first poems to be found (at least in Dutch poetry) in the poetry of new poets. In rock-music that's an exeption. What would have been more programatic for the music and the lyrics of the Doors than this song? It says almost everything about what the Doors were all about.  <br />The End: When I was at puberty I found the part of The End that says: `father, I want to kill you, mother I want to...' to be a little shocking (especialy for others..). When I got to know to stories of the ancient Greek I found out that there really wasn't anything shocking aboutthis song, exept the fact that Morrison put the story about Oidipus and the Freudian version of it into clear words. I still believe The End has a more honost and direct way to put the Oidipous-complex into words. Nothing more (or less) than poetic freedom.  <br /> <br />To give stars for an album is difficult. For it's importance in pop- and doors-history this album must have 5 stars. The End is more worth than five stars and some other songs are real good too. But the album put into perspective of the whole Doors-oeuvre would be a 4-star-album, with the four songs I mentioned earlier definitly bringing to five stars. <br />(For more comments on The Doors: look up my other Doors-reviews)  <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This is the movie based on the original book. Charlie and the choclate factory is about a little boy named charlie who finds one of the 5 golden tickets in a bar of choclate and goes to the legendary Choclate factory run by Willy Wonka. Excluding the oompa loompa songs this movie is one of my favorites. This is nothing like the original movie staring Gene Wilder. Willy Wonka is played by Johnny Depp. I loved JD in this movie. I loved him in this movie alot (Even though he kinda reminds me of Michael Jackson abit). Even so this is a really good family movie and is slowly becoming one of my favorite movies. Don't rent it. Buy It.

B00007AJGH|5.0|Sometimes digital groundbreaking images get in the way of artistry and actually creating good art. Robert Zemeckis is a director who's similar to James Cameron and George Lucas as they try to incorporate new film techniques into their films. George Lucas oddly enough has great visuals but bad films(except Episode 3) while Cameron and Zemeckis make good films that still are visually great. Add Roger Rabbit to the list of not only groundbreaking films but good films overall. <br /> <br />It's the late 40's and animated characters are not drawn, they actually exist side-by-side with humans. Well Eddie Valiant used to be a private detective who specialized in toons until one killed his brother so now he's on all-toon hating rampage. R.K Maroon, owner of Maroon Cartoons wants to use Eddie to take pictures of Jessica Rabbit's infidelity, who's husband is also Maroon Studios big star, Roger Rabbit. After photographing them play pattycake(the actually clapping game that is), Roger gets upset. Then he's a suspect when Marvin Acme, the other pattycake and owner of Toontown as well as behind the same company Wile E. Coyote uses to get that Roadrunner. <br /> <br />So Valiant becomes a reluctant of Roger when he's being hunted by Judge Doom and trying to solve the mystery of not only who killed Marvin Acme but why and what's it got to do with not only Roger but R.K Maroon and a odd company called Cloverleaf. Also on the hunt for Roger is weasels, kind of like Judge Doom's cronies. <br /> <br />This film not only looks great(although real-life/animation combo shots look a bit off such as when a character is holding a cartoon) it's actually a really great film period. I still feel sorry for that shoe that has the unfortunate luck of being near Judge Doom and there's many funny lines (\\"nose? that doesn't rhyme with walls! no, but this does &lt;kicks him in the....yep, those>). The fact that the animation never calls attention to itself is a testament to the film. <br /> <br />Thisfilm is very much like a guess that cartoon as there's so many characters, even obscure ones. I saw Jose from the Three Cabelleros, that kid from Boy Who Cried Wolf, that hippo from a Fantasia segment and faves like Yosemite Sam and Dumbo. Original characters are great such as Roger himself and my favorite weasel Psycho(time to kill the rabbit! hee hee!) <br /> <br />Besides the Back to the Future trilogy, this is probably one of Zemeckis' best films. Cast Away went nowhere while Death Becomes Her wasn't that interesting. Forrest Gump was good but best picture? Pssh. For best film, go all the way to Roger Rabbit.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am so old I consider Cheryl Crow new music.  But my son who just turned 13 introduced me to Green Day by playing their CD's incessantly on road trips, along with Eminem, Bowling for Soup, etc.  I don't really enjoy most of his music, but I gotta tell you I love Green Day.   <br /> <br />American Idiot is a tremendous album.  The more popular songs like the Holiday, September, and the title track are all really terrific songs, but the real gem of the album is a 9-minute track called \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\".  It is a suite of 5 skits that tells the experience of the title character who is trying to escape the boredom and soullessness of surburbia.  While the theme is typical, the music is gritty and the lyrics powerful (example: \\"city of the dead, at the end of another lost highway, signs misleading to nowhere\\").  Some likened this to other opuses like \\"Bohemian Rhasody\\" and \\"Tommy\\" but in my opinion this stands on its own uniqueness.  It is angry and sad and reminds us all of how it feels to be young and rebellious.
B0000A7W14|3.0|Boyz N the Hood is only 3 star worthy for one reason. It's depicting the truth. It's pretty effective at doing that and shows the rough life in the hood. The first 20 minutes are excellent but then it kind of goes to the dogs.  <br />The movie starts off with Tre (Cuba Gooding Junior), having to  leave his mother because of breaking a promise to go live with his father Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). He meets friends, half brothers, Ricky and Doughboy (Ice Cube). You see as they grow up in some very effective moments. Then it jumps 15 years later...and the movie goes sour. <br /> <br />Later on, we've got these boys all grown up with Tre living a pretty descent life, Doughboy into violence, drugs, alcohol while Ricky is a smart kid and an all pro football player trying to get into USC.  <br />Now there's cussing, violence, the typical you'd expect from a movie this intense but it throws in random humor and just isn't very interesting. It is dealing with a very serious topic but doesn't manage to be effective in delivering a message. The ending is tragic as you'd expect but afterwards...I wasn't impressed by this movie. It was to see that this was the truth..but it just wasn't a good movie. It just drags on and is pretty boring and also just has 15 minutes straights of random and pointless discussions about nothing. besides cussing, and bla bla bla.  <br />It makes an effort but really isn't as good as it could've been which is a shame.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|OMG i cant wait for this... n e one know when it comes out in england??? you's are well lucky getting it before x-mas...
B00064MW6K|2.0|I'll cover the good points first. Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with. Why she chose this role, I am not sure. Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather. Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role. He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?) Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie. How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face? <br /> <br />The bad points are plentiful. The plot was unbelievable. The dialogue was horrendous. The CGI was unconvincing. The characters were silly. The mythology was laughable. At least Spiderman had a good message: \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\" Catwoman's message seems to be: \\"Don't stand in the way of an independent woman.\\" Morality is ambigious. Independance is key. Oprah and Martha would be proud.
B000002J1S|5.0|What more can be said for this magnificent musical masterpiece than has already been said? This album rests comfortably in the Progressive Rock Hall of Fame with such other classics as Brain Salad Surgery, Close to the Edge, and Song for All Seasons; yet has its own unique place among the giants. There is no prog rock concept album that I know of that weaves such a weird, compelling and interesting story as this work (no, not even Topographic Oceans; besides, that's a spiritual journey more than a concept). The accompanying storyline written in the liner notes should have won a Hugo or Nebula Award as far as I'm concerned. Though it might seem to some that Gabriel's lyrical fancies and stage antics were a bit over the top during his years with Genesis, it took such a mind as his to pull off something this ambitious, as it did to pull off songs like The Knife, Supper's Ready, or Battle of Epping Forest. Though some of the keyboard parts of In The Rapids remind me of the instrumental part of Cinema Show, much of the album does not remind me of anything Genesis ever did before or has done since. The mood of the album ranges from gentle pathos (The Lamia, Silent Sorrow) to anger(Back in NYC) to fear (In the Cage) to hypnotic (Hairless Heart, Ravine)to humorous (Counting out Time, Supernatural Anesthetist). The effects are some of the strangest I have ever heard used in prog rock of the time, especially the guitar. <br />I remember being so entranced with the album when I first got it on vinyl that I forced myself to learn the intro chords to The Lamia on the piano, and quickly wore the disks out. I have since purchased the remastered CD, and am quite pleased with it. <br />Though the epic albums of the Flower Kings and Glass Hammer provide some of the same satisfaction today for those of us with long attention spans, they can't quite capture the kind of surreal weirdness that Lamb conveys. If you are an early Genesis or classic prog fan, and are missing this CD, run, don't walk, to get it. <br /> <br />PS: I have had the pleasure of seeing this album performed to near perfection in its entirety on stage, not by Genesis, but by the magnificent Genesis tribute band Musical Box. You should also run, not walk, to see any performances by that band in your area. <br />
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I love the original Merry Christmas released in 1994 so much, but the new dualdisc is amazing!  The 2 extra tracks are great! For the DVD, I love the video's for Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and All I Want For Christmas Is You the most.  Both these videos are animated and they came out great.  This is a must buy this holiday season for all Christmas music lovers.
B00005JO17|5.0|I've only seen the 3-D version, and I can't imagine seeing this film without 3-D.  One of the great things Disney did was to actually give you 3-D glasses that look just like Chiken Little's glasses, complete with green plastic frames.  These glasses are much more comfortable than the old paper framed glasses of old.  Tip: Save the glasses to use next month when you drive around looking a Christmas lights.  The glasses will add a fun element to the Christmas light viewing. <br /> <br />The story is very simple, but fun.  Suffice it to say, every viewer will go home warm and fuzzy.  Chicken Little is a sympathetic character who gets picked on and laughed at while trying to earn the approval of his father.  His friends are all \\"nerds\\" with hearts of gold.  There is a lot of fun action that kids will love.  Some of the scenes get a little scary for very young viewers, but nothing too intense. My young children really enjoyed the show. <br /> <br />For adults, this is fun to watch, especially in 3-D.  If you don't have kids, but tend to enjoy light hearted cartoons like \\"The Little Mermaid\\", I'm sure you'll enjoy this film.  This is not a musical, but it does have a fun sound track, complete with a Spice Girls song that fits the funny scene it's in. <br /> <br />Go take the whole family to this one and insist on the 3-D version.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I always hated male models. I would really hate Derreck Zoolander if he was real but fortunately he isn't; he's a wonderful character portrayed by Ben Stiller. <br /> <br />The movie is full of funny bits and lines you will repeat to your friends or may even have heard before. 'Orange Mocha Frappacino!', 'Have I been taking crzy pills?' and 'Moisture is the essence of wetness' are not so funny now but they will be when you hear them. <br /> <br />Ben Stiller plays a part he ususally doesn't, as a stupid male model. Owen Wilson is his usual smug great and Will Ferrell probably plays his best role apart from Ron Burgondy in Anchorman here. <br /> <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|This is a very entertaining and fun show to see, and lead me to rent the Firefly TV series and watch it too.  Then I went back and watched the film again, with a lot more pleasure, knowing something about the \\"universe\\" of the crew of Serenity.  I hope there will more of \\"Serenity\\" in some form as this seems to be a story just starting.  The characters are good, their interaction entertaining, the plots has enought turns and twists to keep the interest high and the special effects, while not \\"Star Wars\\" in quality, are quite good enough to support the story told.
B000002KCI|5.0|This album has aged very well, and I would have to say that even having owned it for 30 years, I still enjoy it as much now as I did then. Danger Bird, Barstool Blues, and Cortez the Killer may be the best rock n roll Neil ever wrote, so I reach for this CD more than any other Neil album. In my mind, this is the best Crazy Horse album Neil ever made - quite an endorsement considering how many good Crazy Horse records he's made.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|The popularity of the \\"superpower school genre\\" is at an all-time high with post-pubescent, pre-cape, Superman in Smallville and the Harry Potter franchise entering into the high school years, not to mention the success of Prof. Xaiver's school of mutants. Spidey is in collage now, but lets not forget his super-power secondary school antics or Dash Parr's elementary school track records. So naturally the time was right for a film that is part \\"Breakfast Club\\" and part \\"Fantastic Four.\\" Sky High is the predictable coming-of-age spoof with a superhero shtick. Will Stronghold, the protagonist teen, and the son of two of Earth's greatest heroes (played terrifically by Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston) has a lot to live-up to, but no powers to speak of (at first). Adding to his natural teen anxieties Will is surrounded by \\"gifted\\" teens and intense teachers including Bruce Campbell, Lynda Carter, and Cloris Leachman. Ex-\\"Kids-in the-Hall\\" Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald, best known in Disney circles as the voice of Pleakley in the Stitch series, are terrific together as Mr. Boy and Mr. Medulla.  The film has some twisted, yet familiar takes on high school hierarchies, archetypes and academic labels, the first is introduced though the superhero power placement test, which gives a whole new meaning to standardized testing not to mention the obligatory embarrassing gym activities. This classifies the students as \\"Hero\\" or \\"Sidekick.\\"<br /><br />Effects are important in the superhero genre, even the super-sub genres.<br /><br />The visuals are just the right balance of comic book realism, some key moments being the transformation of the mild-mannered school bus into the supersonic Sky High Bus and the \\"Save the Citizen\\" homage to the X-Men's Danger Room is great fun.<br /><br />The soundtrack is the perfect clue to the `80's high school spoof with tunes you might misremember hearing in \\"Sixteen Candles\\"  but, it definitely adds the right flavor. Young pop groups and Grammy nominated bands perform covers of classic teen film tunes, like Bowling for Soup's appropriate inclusion \\"Melt with You,\\"  Vitamin C's remake of \\"Voice Carry\\"  or Steven Straight with \\"One Thing Leads to Another\\" and more (checkout CD).<br /><br />Overall, super-family fun for the whole family, but may disappoint hardcore comic fans in it pedestrian handling of the material, especially on the heels of similarly themed projects like \\"The Incredibles.\\"ated bands perform covers of classic teen film tunes, like Bowling for Soup's appropriate inclusion \\"Melt with You,\\"  Vitamin C's remake of \\"Voice Carry\\"  or Steven Straight with \\"One Thing Leads to Another\\" and more (checkout CD). <br /> <br />Overall, super-family fun for the whole family, but may disappoint hardcore comic fans in it pedestrian handling of the material, especially on the heels of similarly themed projects like \\"The Incredibles.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I can't get over how well this movie goes past all the glitter and glitz of life and shows us the true meaning of love. The world's oldest story and the world's most beautiful gift not to be thrown away but nurtured. Brava Baz Luhrmann!
B00003CXUM|5.0|This is Wong Kar-Wai's best film.  The story is simple but very moving.  It is told with elegance and grace; much is conveyed with an expression or a gesture that speaks volumes. <br /> <br />Chris Doyle's cinematography adds so much.  The images are beautiful and haunting.  The music is very well chosen, too.  The love theme will stay with you for a long time, and the cello music in the Angkor Wat scene at the end is profoundly sad. <br /> <br />Recommended both to Wong's fans and to those who would like to discover his work. <br />

B0006L16N8|1.0|Chris Martin and his reasonably famous band Coldplay struggled to collaborate a smash hit album, since they've been off the radar for three years or ten or so. Chris feverishly spent many hours in the quiet of the night penning the lyrics, or rather sweet poetry for Coldplay's masterpiece in progress. Sometimes, his baby daughter  would cry, and Chris would pick up little Orange and try to console her. While Mango would lull into deep slumber, Chris would become inspired. So then he left Papaya to sleep, and wrote his heartbreaking ballads. Sometimes, he would sing his lyrics to wife Gwenyth, who laughed and said things like, \\"The dialogue in Shallow Hal was better.\\" or \\"You're a massive tool.\\" To make things worse, the record label was mean and said: \\" Chris Martin, you better make a new record quick or we'll stomp on your balls with a killer lawsuit!\\"  <br /> <br />So, at the Speed of Sound he worked. Don't Panic, he reminded the band. The Hardest Part was trying to come up with beats. With brilliant, but Twisted Logic, someone suggested What If they re-used the old music? The drummer said, \\"White Shadows Talk to me, and they sent A Message: that idea sucks. I will not let this band be Swallowed In The Sea of shame.\\" Then Chris hit him X and Y, Square One in the eye. \\"That's Low,\\" said another band member. The band dog began humping Chris' leg. \\"Stop that,\\" said Chris, \\"Or I'll have to Fix You.\\"
B000002UAX|3.0|It was a turbulent time while the Beatles were recording the White Album. They had to contend with 4 major issues that had begun to seriously affect all of them: a) the aftermath of of their manager Brian Epstein's death, and who was to replace him;(b) their ever burgeoning business and legal problems including the setting up of Apple; (c) the growing personal friction between John and Paul; (d) John Lennon's new relationship with Yoko Ono, who reportedly interfered in the recording of this album, much to the annoyance of Paul and George. By this time the individual members of the Beatles had already outgrown the band and were bored with it, especially John Lennon who temporarily quit the Beatles at one point. So it was only one more year before the inevitable break-up came. The result here was their most uneven studio record in their late period, with no real theme or connection between the tracks, unlike earlier efforts. However there were still some high quality songs, but quite a bit of self indulgence and simply poor material too.<br /><br />This was also the time when McCartney had begun to develop a habit of writing flippant and rather irritating songs, which became far more evident after the Beatles split; songs here like 'Why don't we do it in the road', 'Rocky Racoon', and the ghastly 'Ob-la-di' etc. On the other hand there were 3 aces of his included, his best song being 'Blackbird', 'I will' and the catchy and humorous 'Back in the USSR'. 'Honey pie' was his obvious attempt to outdo 'When I'm  64', but not nearly as good.<br /><br />Sadly, Lennon also had his fill of below par tracks, but these were more weird rather than irritating. 'Revolution no 9' was bizarre Yoko influenced nonsense. 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey' and 'Bungalow Bill' were just plain silly. 'Happiness is a warm gun' is not one song, but more like 3 different songs moulded into one, and is a mess. 'Looking through a glass onion' is much better with interesting chord changes, strange lyrics and even stranger ending. But the best Lennon tracks were the folk-like ballads, 'Julia' (dedicated to his late mother), 'Cry baby cry', 'I'm so tired', 'Sexy Sadie', and  'Dear Prudence', his simplest song here and my favourite.<br /><br />George Harrison had 3 tracks, one of which, 'While my guitar gently weeps' was easily his best and instantly accessible tracks on the whole album. 'Piggies' about human greed was lyrically clever, but nothing special musically. But 'Savoy Truffle' was one song too many. Ringo takes a bow also, and closes the album with a dreamy lullaby 'Goodnight' and tastefully done too.<br /><br />So had the Beatles carefully edited out the weaker material, and condensed this double album to a single one it would have been so much improved. There is too much inconsistency to rate this album highly, and it certainly was hardly groundbreaking stuff compared to their 2 previous albums.nges, strange lyrics and even stranger ending.

B000002B30|2.0|Why, Bruce, Why?  I used to think you were lookin' out for the workin' man like me.  Now you seem a bit like the kind of person you used to protest.  I have nine of your albums now, and I just needed a Greatest Hits to complete a library of the Springsteen songs I grew up listening to on the radio.    Unfortunately, you didn't deliver what you promised in the record's title - Greatest Hits.  Had you at least been forthcoming and named the record \\"A Few Hits, A Few Of My Favorite Album Cuts, And A Few So-So New Songs,\\" I wouldn't have felt quite so disappointed.    Thanks for \\"Born To Run,\\" \\"Hungry Hearts\\" and \\"Dancing In The Dark.\\"  But on what planet was \\"Blood Brothers\\" a hit, or in any way worthy to include instead of \\"I'm on Fire?\\"  Why the tedious \\"River\\" instead of \\"Tunnel Of Love?\\"     If this were just a \\"Great Songs\\" record, I would still ask why the new throw-aways \\"This Hard Land\\" and \\"Murder Incorporated\\" are included, rather than the brilliant \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" or hard-to-find \\"Trapped?\\"  I should probably add a star for not adding the nauseating Tom Cruise dialague to the beautiful \\"Secret Garden.\\"    Honestly, why put 18 tracks on a Greatest Hits record, and only include 7 of your 12 top 10 songs?  I concede that part of the your problem is having such a wealth of great material, but that fact only makes this record more frustrating.  If you were a \\"one hit wonder\\" instead of a legend, it might be understandable to release a Greatest Hits record stuffed to the gills with filler.      \\"Bruce Springsteen Greatest Hits\\" should have been one of the best records ever, period.  Instead it is one of my biggest disappointments ever.  Actual \\"hits\\" are replaced by personal favorites and unmemorable new recordings.      Oh, so disappointing.
B000AL730O|1.0|I am a long time fan of the Beatles (together and solo) and have loved nearly everything the fab-four have put out, except for this one. Upon hearing the critics praising this new album you would have thought it WAS McCartney's best. Boy, was I suprised! I tried (I really have) to listen with an open mind several times and I don't see what the fuss is over? This is drivel and not worthy to be compared to anything McCartney has done in the past. I much rather liked Flaming Pie than this one! No comparison between the two. I hope Paul is able to redeem himself with the next album (if he has anything left in him). If not, I would prefer that he hang it up and rest on his prior accomplishments.
B0002S947K|5.0|I have yet to grasp just what it is about Ray's music that has left me in awe. \\"Trouble\\" is an amazing album that, I think, should be recognized by a larger scope of listeners. I was first introduced to LaMontagne's music through a friend, and I was a bit hesitant- for the fact that I am quite the \\"hard rock\\" type of listener. But upon a few good listenings, I was hooked. This is the type of album that grows on you over time, with every song sunk in depth and beauty. Each song is simple, soothing, and brilliant. Most reviewers note Ray's  powerful voice, which is nothing far from the truth. I was taken aback by the sheer power of this man's voice, and the words he has to say. A few of my personal favorite tracks are: Hannah, Burn, All the Wild Horses, Trouble,... Well, really, I could just list them all. I encourage everyone, despite what you think \\"your\\" style of music is, to check Ray out. \\"Trouble\\" is garunteed to not let you down.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Despite being a bit too long, a horrible script, some sub-par acting, unnecessary male nudity, and some lame set designs........this movie was awesome. <br />     Haha, ok.  In all seriousness this movie was quite good.  The story-telling was nowhere near Braveheart or Gladiator but the action is some of the best I've ever seen.  The battles are fantasctic!  There are four big battles total which I will run down for you here: <br /> <br />BATTLE 1:  This battle consists of the greeks first landing on the beach of Troy.  Brad er..uhh...I mean Achilles is amazing here.  He tears through the poor Trojans with such quickness and vigor that it is sure to bring out the inner man in all of you.  <br /> <br />BATTLE 2:  This is the biggest battle in the film, the main one, the big Kahuna if I may.  Thousands upon thousands of Greeks fight thousands of Trojans in front of their walls.  The visuals are fantastic.  For example: arrows fly from the city before raining down on the troops.  Also, in this battle is a cool confrontation between Hector and Ajax (I think that's his name). <br /> <br />BATTLE 3:  The Trojans attack the Greeks on the beach in the early morning hours.  It is short but sweet.  The visuals are, once again, great. <br /> <br />BATTLE 4:  I won't give away the ending but, the winner completely destroys the loser. <br /> <br />     All in all, this is an entertaining movie although the non-action scenes may make you want to puch a baby.  The action is worth it, though, becuase it is some of the best on film.  Achilles vs. Hector is THE best one v. one fight ever.  Buy it on DVD, then you can skip all the lame stuff and just watch the action!
0316666343|3.0|I would give it 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  This was a good read.  Creative story and pulls the heart strings. But the subject is so disturbing, I often asked myself if I really wanted to continue reading this book.  I disliked some of the characters, especially the mother.  Overall it was worth the time, but it was ultimately pretty forgettable.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Tull is the most underrated band of all time.  They are better than Led Zep (you heard me right..foo).  Ian Anderson is the best songwriter to ever live.  The musicianship is top notch from all the guys.  Aqualung, though not their best like most say, is a very good album. <br /> <br />Aqualung - This is the immortal song that opens up the album.  The immortal riff leads to the immortal middle part before it hits the immortal guitar solo by Barre (his best studio recorded solo ever). <br /> <br />Cross-eyed Mary - Wow, what an ugly song!  In a good way, though.  It's very bass oriented and reverbial.  It'll really test out your stereo like there's no tomorrow. <br /> <br />Cheap Day Return - A little acustic diddy from Ian.  I love these little songs, they add so much flavor to the essence of Tull. <br /> <br />Mother Goose - A very flutey song that sounds like it belongs at a renaissance fair.  But it doesn't, it belongs right friggin here! <br /> <br />Wond'ring Aloud - The most well known of all the acustic diddies.  It deserves the title. <br /> <br />Up to Me - A kinda darkly funny song with a cool riff and some guy laughing in the background. <br /> <br />My God - My God, this is a good song!  An amazing acustic intro, a dark theme, and a fantastic flute solo make this the best song on the original LP. <br /> <br />Hymn 43 - This is a very loud and sarcastic song criticizing the church of England (a common theme here). <br /> <br />Slipstream - Another acustic diddy!  HAAZAA! <br /> <br />Locomotive Breath - A brilliant song.  It starts of slow before it gets into the hard pounding riff.  It also has an amazing flute solo. <br /> <br />Wind Up - A story of a boy and church.  It's a great song that changes speed and rythm halfway through.  A bit like Aqualung only it's the complete opposite.  Fitting aye? <br /> <br />BONUS TRACKS!!! <br /> <br />Lick Your Fingers Clean - This is an awesome song to sing when you're drunk.  It sounds like a bunch of drunkenIrish men, I love it! <br /> <br />Wind Up (quad version) - Snore <br /> <br />Ian Anderson Interview - Interesting. <br /> <br />Songs For Jeffrey - A cool kinda throwback song. <br /> <br />Fat Man - A simple song that always makes me laugh. <br /> <br />Bouree - Words cannot describe how cool this song is.  Seriously, if your too cheap to buy this album, at least download this song. <br /> <br />

B00024YVJU|5.0|Eloy (name taken from H G Well`s Time Machine) is a German Atmospheric, Progressive Art Rock band that was formed back in 1969. Through the years, personal wise, the band has totally turned over, in some positions, several times. Their originator Frank Bornemann (guitars/vocals) has persevered, presiding over a three decade band, that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music, I've had the fortune to hear.<br /><br />OCEAN<br /><br />Ocean, their sixth album, released in 1977, is a concept album, depicting the rise and fall of Atlantis. Though there are only four tracks, they average almost eleven minutes each. Many Eloy aficionados point to this album as their `tour de force'. It is excellent, but as far as I'm concerned , based on what I've heard so far, there is no album that stands heads above the others.<br /><br />Overall, Ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of Hawkwind or a more unknown band that I once reviewed named Ship of Fools. It also reminds me Jeff Wayne's, War of the Worlds.<br /><br />Track listing<br /><br />1. Poseidon's Creation (11:38) **** Has a long droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro. At the 4:40 mark, Bornemann finally begins the vocal. There is quite a lot of guitar playing on this song, augmented occasionally by the synth.<br /><br />2. Incarnation Of The Logos (8:25) **** Has an atmospheric vocal beginning. The song doesn't seem to have much of a melody until the 3:40 mark when the synth/organ takes over with a pleasant one, assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then.<br /><br />3. Decay Of The Logos (8:15) ***½ The shortest song at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more monologue than music. When it does get going after about three minutes it's still jerky in a medium paced beat. Strong synth playing through the middle.<br /><br />4. Atlantis' Agony At June 5th - 8498, 13 p.m. Gregorian Earthtime (15:35) *****<br /><br />This is a monster song. It is like nothing I've ever heard. Except for a fifty some second monologue at the beginning, \\"Atlantis...\\" starts with a truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro. Not just any intro, like you're used to, with a full orchestra and violins. No this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make the great Pink Floyd, envious, with the propitious use of ghostly sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute organ bridge, with no beat just the Hammond a few side effects and you. No it doesn't get boring. Instead it sets you up for the vocals, which issue forth at about the eight minute mark. Slowly the rhythm section establishes a slow beat, while the singer does a great imitation of Bob Dylan, with a remarkable spacey synth breaking in between the vocal. But we're not done. With about two minutes left, the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo (the first time I`ve heard them play at this speed). Now the violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this great finale.<br /><br />Total Time: 43:53<br /><br />Line-up<br /><br />- Frank Bornemann / guitars, vocals<br /><br />- Klaus-Peter Matziol / basses, vocals<br /><br />- J&uuml;rgen Rosenthal / drums, percussion, flute<br /><br />- Detlev Schmidtchen / keyboards, mellotron, xylophone, voice<br /><br />- The Boys Of Santiago / chorus (1)<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />One of the factors, I find appealing about this band, is that in the span of three decades, they managed to present a style of music which was compatible with each era, so listening to their albums from different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of various time periods.

B0000667RO|5.0|For me, this is an excellent Bryan Adams collection.  It has more romantic and serious songs than fun/happy ones, and that suits me just fine.  A couple of songs that I wasn't familiar with are quite good:  \\"The Best Of Me\\", a mid-tempo cut, and \\"I'm Ready\\", a slower number, are both given sophisticated musical treatments.  As for the essential ballads, I had forgotten how beautiful \\"Let's Make A Night To Remember\\", \\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman\\" and \\"Please Forgive Me\\" really are.  I feel that I can immerse myself in them, like in a warm bath.  Of course, no Bryan Adams collection would be complete without \\"Run To You\\" and \\"Everything I Do\\", and they are included also.  Another good thing is that out of the upbeat selections, \\"Cloud Number Nine\\" is practically a dance song, and \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me\\" is hip as hell.  This saves them from being just \\"happy\\". (Why is that important?  I guess, as Bryan himself would put it, that just plain old \\"happy\\" doesn't look good on me.)  And Bryan's amorous vibe goes right to the core, so I'm feelin' it, ya know?  If I could own only one of Bryan's CD's, this would be the one.
0553801503|2.0|First, I understand that this book is the result of having too much material to fit in one book, and so Martin was forced to divide the same book into two pieces.  At least, I understand that's what he says. <br /> <br />I think the problem here is that this book (and now I fear book 5) are both seriously lacking in editing.  There are new character POVs introduced in this book that seem to add absolutely nothing to the overarching storyline.   <br /> <br />POVs/Storyline's that could have been removed: <br /> <br />Everything dealing with the Victarion and the Ironmen choosing a new King and starting to take over new lands.  This could have been explained (and in fact was) in a few pages simply saying that the islands were being invaded.   <br /> <br />The Dornish intrigue surrounding Princess Myrcella was ultimately  circular, and only hinted at greater things to come, but it didn't need to be laid out in new POVs. <br /> <br />Brienne's ultimately fruitless and boring search.  Did we need to read about her fruitless search and constant self-insecurity? <br /> <br />Much of Cersei's chapters seemed extraneous, all saying 'she was running the kingdom badly' over and over. <br /> <br />Sansa's chapters had almost no action or plot movement. <br /> <br />Samwell's sea trip involving lots of wretching was uninteresting and uninspiring. Also it was too convienent that he'd run into Arya by happenstance. (I'm waiting for his chance meeting with Sansa next, since he has already stumbled onto Bran.) <br /> <br />So, after removing some or all of these POVs, I'm supposed to believe there was no room for what was going on with Jon or Dany, or even more than 3 Arya chapters (By far the most interesting of the entire book)? <br /> <br />In short, I believe GRRM when he said he had one very large book that needed to be cut.  Unfornately, it ultimately needed to be cut into one smaller high-quality book, not into two books, the first of which is slow-moving, boring, and I fear,ultimately irrelevent. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is an unabashed witch hunt on Bush and his administration. Many people claim that all of the information given in this film is false. I'll agree that it is definitely spun against Bush, but I seriously doubt that all of this info is false. With top White House aides and GOP House and Senate figureheads being indicted, combined with plummeting approval ratings, outrage at the Iraq war, and general unrest of the American people, it's obvious that the American public feels that it has been lied to by the Bush administration and Conservative talking-heads in the media about the so-called \\"integrity\\" of this administration. It looks like, with the truth beginning to reach the light of day, Michael Moore was actually a sort of visionary and had a great deal of courage to voice dissent against this presidency when it was very unpopular to do so. This film makes so much more sense now than it did a year ago. I'll wager it will continue to do so the more we find out about these people that we have elected.
B000AL730O|5.0|I had been anxiously waiting for the release of this album after seeing a program about it on VH1.  After checking it out more on AOL Sessions, I told myself that I'd get this album no matter what.  I finally got my hands on it, and I wasn't disappointed.  These 13 songs, mainly acoustic or piano ballads, are some of McCartney's best work ever, not to mention he plays all the instruments on the album (except the strings).  Let me give each song a better description: <br /> <br />1. Fine Line - poppy piano rock, overall the best song on the album <br /> <br />2. How Kind of You - sweet and gentle ballad <br /> <br />3. Jenny Wren - a \\"Blackbird\\"-esque acoustic song <br /> <br />4. At The Mercy - a haunting piano ballad <br /> <br />5. Friends To Go - catchy acoustic rock <br /> <br />6. English Tea - how can I put this...proper English music, maybe, one of my favorites <br /> <br />7. Too Much Rain - another gentle ballad <br /> <br />8. A Certain Softness - another haunting piano song <br /> <br />9. Riding to Vanity Fair - one of the best songs on the album, kinda hard to describe <br /> <br />10. Follow Me - yet another acoustic ballad <br /> <br />11. Promise To You Girl - one of the more energetic songs on the album <br /> <br />12. This Never Happened Before - piano ballad <br /> <br />13. Anyway - ends the album with a good piano song, listen for some extra material about a minute after the song ends <br /> <br />A definite must-have for any McCartney fan.  This will not disappoint.  It's no Let It Be, but it comes close, VERY close.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This definatly one of the worst movies in history. It is right up there with Jason X.  But this movie is far worse. The movie is soooooo slow and long it makes me sick. There is nothing memorable about this movie whatsoever. Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Not to mention this movie is already in the $4.88 bin at Bal-mart.<br /><br />That sums it all up right there.
B000929AJQ|3.0|This being the first Nine Inch Nails album I've ever bought, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  What I got was 53 minutes and change worth of loud metal and weird synth effects.  Not really the kind of music I listen to, but if you are a die-hard fan, it's makes a great addition to NIN collections.  For me, the only two songs that really stand out amongst all the songs on the album are the two singles that were released, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only.\\"
0783231032|3.0|Bought this movie at Ball-Mart in the $4.88 bin. Looked at the cover and seeing Belushi and Akroid I thought It couldnt be that bad. Boy, was I wrong.  Their parts are far and few between, and not even funny. The most compelling character was Belushi, and he was barly in the movie.  Not only that, his character is pretty much useless. The same goes for all of the actors.  Nothing really gets acomplished.<br /><br />Overall it is very dull.  Not quite as dull as Close Encounters, though. That movie really sucked. But this one is not much better.<br /><br />Bottom line, I could have never seen this movie and not miss out on anything.<br /><br />Final review------------------ -100 Dilly Bars
0792165020|1.0|I heard so many good reviews I went to see this movie. I was sick. If anybody likes this movie, they should check with psychologist.  <br /> It is one of those:\\"tell me if you like this movie, and I will tell you what kind of person you are.\\" <br />The worst was that I found the same movie in foreign section--Made in Italy. So on the top of it, it was just copied.
0156027321|5.0|This book is about survival.    The premise is deceptively simple.      What would you do if you were set adrift in a lifeboat with a Bengel Tiger?      Let's ignore the flippant responses of those who reply with the single word   \\"die.\\"    This is one of those books which is written on several levels.  On the surface it is a pragmatic description of how a boy survives  his ordeal, using every tool at his disposal, using everything he knows  about tigers  that he learned from his own observations and from  the teaching of his  zoo curator father.    He uses his own cunning, his own bravery and his own fear. In the end he   establishes a fragile balance  between himself,  the lifeboat, the tiger and the sea.    But while all this is going on, the book explores  concepts of   philosophy, religion, captivity, boredom, symbiosis and far too many other  realms to detail in a simple review.    This is one book you will remember. Give it a read.      About the reviewer:  Rudy Vener writes unique, custom poems based on customer's  stories,  feelings, words and memories. [...]
B00004Y7SF|4.0|Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas 1994 is the best christmas album ever. Next would be Christina Aguilera's My Kind of Christmas. I especially like The Christmas Song (Holiday remix) which is a dance version. Sometimes this song is played at the clubs during the holiday season.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|Yet no one mentioned how sharp and exiting the sound quality is in this DVD. <br /> <br />If you have a home cinema system you will greatly enjoy this product. You can choose 5.1 Dolby Surround or even better 5.1 DTS which just sound extrodinary well. I have lots of DVD concerts in my collection and this one in terms of sound quality and of course the performances is probably the Best. <br /> <br />I am sure that if you even do not have any special sound system you will greatly enjoy this DVD because the show is perfect.  <br /> <br />Very good value for your money.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums ever.  I'd just like to say that dev1 who wrote the most bizarre 'review' I have ever read is a paranoid nutcase.  Hegemony, from a red hot chili peppers album, calm down dude. If 'the man' was trying put thoughts in our head I think their are more effective was of doing it than through a semi mainstream rap/funk album.  Regardless of anything anyone says about this album (your all entitled to your opinion) it was made for pure reasons, to qoute john frusciante 'like a bodily function' it was just made out of their natural love for music.  And if you are a muscician you will understand that feeling even if you hate the music. So to me this album is the very definition of music.  I think dev1 needs to be less paranoid, maybe ease of on the cocaine.  Maybe all your thoughts and feelings are a product of hegemony, maybe by writing that review you are playing into the hands of 'the man' don't write a review for an album when you don't understand the meaning or purpose of art.
B00005JO1G|5.0|\\"Jarhead\\" is the true story of Anthony Swafford (Gyllenhaal) from basic training through the Gulf War.  Basic training is rough and reminiscent of the movie \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  Swafford emerges from the training as a sniper candidate, and becomes best friends with his spotter, Tony (Sarsgaard).  Sergeant Siek (Foxx) is their commander, and sees them as the best snipers of the group.  In 1990, Swafford's unit is sent to Iraq to participate in the Gulf War, but this war is not a war for snipers, and he soon finds himself ready to fight, but never allowed to.<br /><br />The unit is trained and trained and trained to be their very best, but there is no outlet for all their training, and soon that begins to take its toll.  They are soldiers who are unable to use the skills that they have, and sooner or later someone is going to snap.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the baby faced Swafford, and is a definite candidate for an Oscar nomination.  Sarsgaard, who has been in a number of films this year, finally has found a role to really shine in.  Finally, Foxx is perfect as a true Marine that loves being a Marine.  \\"Jarhead\\" is an interesting war movie that really has little war in it.  Its focus is on the people that are there to fight the war, and what happens when the highly trained men are not allowed to do what they have been trained for.  This is the best war movie in recent years, and I highly recommend it.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|...especially the one with Alicia Silverstone.  Although, \\"it's time for a freeze!\\" is a damn good line, no denying it.  Anyways, onto the review. <br /> <br />All in all I'd have to say this was a pretty good movie, I'd say the second best Batman film made, next to the first one with Keaton and Nickleson.  I especially enjoyed the first 45 min, dealing with Bruce Wayne's tutelage under Liam Neisen, who is brilliant in the film.  The whole Batman character has been made much more realistic than in past films (although less comic-booky), and psychologically this movie is far superior to its predecesors.  The idea of Batman as an object of fear is well explored, and I find it refreshing in the face of too-friendly superheroes like Spiderman and the like.  Katie Holmes is passable (at best) as young Bruce's romantic interest, although the romance really takes a major backseat to the crime fighting an all.  Cillian Murphy is great as the Scarecrow, one of the more interesting Batman villians (and just not as fruity as Riddler). <br /> <br />So mostly good, but some areas to watch out for: <br />- Fight scenes: Commonly described as \\"victim's point of view\\", a lot of the fighting in this movie just gave me a headache.  It's impossible to tell who's hitting who or what the hell is really going on.  Victim's point of view is just a stupid idea.  So if a guy gets clocked in the head and falls on his back, is the camera supposed to just stare at the sky until he wakes up?  No, because that would be stupid.  Fight scenes would've been so much better without a camera controlled by a drunken chimpanzee. <br /> <br />- Gruff voice:  Yeh, I understand that Batman should sound scary and maybe disguise his voice a tad, but Nolan just goes way overboard with the huskiness.  It almost comical at points.  I defy you not to laugh when he's yelling at the fat cop to get info out of him.  Just histerical. <br /> <br />- Lack of congruence:  Not sure if this was intentional or not, but some stuff in the plot just doesn't fit in with the previous Batman films.  Not really a huge deal, but it might bug some people. <br /> <br />So yeh, a few less than grand areas, but an entertaining film nonetheless.  Give it a shot.
0786715103|5.0|A truly insightful, eye-witness account of the breakdown of a peace process and absolute failure of humanity. By the end of the book, I felt thoroughly ashamed for being a Westerner, a white person and member of the same human race that created the Rwandan mess.  <br /> <br />From the utter inneffectiveness and ambivalence of the UN, to the arrogance and greed of the US & British, the duplicity of the French and the \\"who me\\" shamelessness of the cursed Belgians, Lt. Gen. D'allaire has taught us that our world and concepts of aiding our fellow mankind are full of unnecessary complexity. <br /> <br />Out of the deaths of 800,000 can we start to learn exactly what our priorities should be? It may be too late for us, but perhaps it's something we can uniformly teach the world's children.
0553801503|2.0|I have been a big fan of Martins but I fear after reading FOC he may be going down the road of Robert Jordan(hook you and string you along for the next ten years) I rushed out and bought the book immediatley but with the next book I will patiently wait for the library to have it available so I do not waste my money on a monotony of story lines.  Mr. Martin can we expect another eight books in this series?
B000058TDY|2.0|Briefly -- be aware before you buy this that it is far from the great music Cat previously released.  I am amazed at the reviews that say this is the reviewer's \\"favorite,\\" or that it is one of Cat's best.  It simply is not.  That is my opinion, and the opinion of just about every other serious Cat fan.  Before you buy this album based on the reviews, consider the following: (1) if you own no CS, then look at Tea For The Tillerman, Catch Bull At Four, Mona Bone Jakon, or Teaser and The Firecat.  They are better, by almost all fans' testimony.  (2) If you already have the above, and you want this to round out your Cat collection, then go ahead, but be ready for a sore disappointment.  It's better then your average pop, but not what we expect from Cat.

0895260131|5.0|This book is highlighting what the U.S media and government have refused to acknowledge and address in recent years.   <br /> <br />Here are a few verses that guide the Islamic followers and Islamic terrorists.  Those who refute these passages and rationalize them by using the \\"context\\" argument, don't have much leg to stand on when these passages from the Quran are considered to be the \\"direct word of god,\\" free from human alteration.   <br /> <br />\\"You may already know about this one: O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. [al-Ma'idah 5:51.11] <br /> <br />But did you know that there are 123 verses in the Quran concerning fighting and killing for the cause of Allah? Here are but a few passages: <br /> <br />-Muslims are encouraged to be wholly occupied (Sura 2:273) with fighting for Allah's cause. <br /> <br />- Allah will give \\"a far richer recompense to those who fight for him\\" (Sura 4:96). <br /> <br />- Regarding infidels (unbelievers), they are the Muslim's \\"inveterate enemies\\" (Sura 4:101). Muslims are to \\"arrest them, besiege them and lie in ambush everywhere\\" (Sura 9:5) for them. They are to \\"seize them and put them to death wherever you find them, kill them wherever you find them, seek out the enemies of Islam relentlessly\\" (Sura 4:90). \\"Fight them until Islam reigns supreme\\" (Sura 2:193). \\"Cut off their heads, and cut off the tips of their fingers\\" (Sura 8:12). <br /> <br />- If a Muslim does not go to war, Allah will kill him (Sura 9:39). He is to be told, \\"the heat of war is fierce, but more fierce is the heat of Hell-fire\\" (Sura 9:81). <br /> <br />- A Muslim must \\"fight for the cause of Allah with the devotion due to him\\" (Sura 22:78) <br /> <br />- Muslims must make war on the infidels (unbelievers) who live around them (Sura 9:123). <br /> <br />- Muslims are to be \\"ruthless to unbelievers\\" (Sura 48:29). <br /> <br />- A Muslim should \\"enjoy the good things\\" he has gained by fighting (Sura 8:69). <br /> <br />- A Muslim can kill any person he wishes if it be a \\"just cause\\" (Sura 6:152). <br /> <br />- Allah loves those who \\"fight for his cause\\" (Sura 61:3). <br />Anyone who fights against Allah or renounces Islam in favor of another religion shall be \\"put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off alternative sides\\" (Sura 5:34). <br /> <br />- Whoever changes his Islamic religion, kill him. Sahih Al-Bukhari (9:57) <br /> <br />- Slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush. (Koran 9:5) <br /> <br />- Take him and fetter him and expose him to hell fire. (Koran 69:30-37) <br /> <br />- I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, Smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips of them. (Koran 8:12) <br /> <br />- They should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides. (Koran 5:33) <br /> <br />- Know that paradise is under the shades of swords. Sahih al-Bukhari Vol 4 p55\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />Does this sound like a religion of peace to you?
B00000DGUG|3.0|I'm a big fan of Alanis Morrisette. I love all of her albums and listen to them constantly. This one would have to be the worst of all of them though. <br /> <br />There are a few of them I like, such as \\"Would Not Come,\\" \\"Unsent,\\" \\"Can't Not,\\" and \\"Joining You,\\" but the rest just aren't very good. They're repetative and don't make a lot of sense. Her singing isn't the best on this album either.  <br /> <br />I'd still suggest buying this cd, but don't expect the wonderful music that's on her other cds.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was born in 1959, so the Beatles were on the radio every time I turned it on for 20 years.  I have a pen pal on line, and although he is an adult, he is young enough to be my son. He has NEVER heard Beatles. He says his dad has heard OF them, but no one knows what they sound like. This album is perfect to send to them: lots of songs, every song a hit, and it has early and later songs. I can't hardly wait to mail this to his family.  :)
B00005ASHM|4.0|A good album God only knows and wouldn,t it be nice are great and carolina no.  the Beatles are the best though cheack out rubbersoul and the white album.  GodBless
B000062YAZ|5.0|I am sorry, but after i saw the review by some kid who claimed the only good song on this cd was rainning blood. First of all little boy Slayer does not suck, and yes rainning blood is amazing. But to say that METALLICA! is better, thats a SIN! Metallica are a bunch of washed up posers. Yeah man St. Anger is awesome! And their old stuff gets boring about the 2nd time around. Slayer is way more talented and Entertaining than Metallica. I can not think of any Metallica cd that can ever be compared to any Slayer cd. Slayer is amazing little boy, and metallica did not invent trash, half of their songs aren't even trash, their slow boring songs. Give me a break, Slayer does not suck!
B000BB1MHS|4.0|I've never really been a big fan of the Willy Wonka story, finding the original nothing more than an overblown musical misfire.  However, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp give so much life and \\"weirdness\\" to the Roald Dahl classic that I found myself hopelessly involved in this morality tale of greed and excess.  Although Depp is reminiscent of Michael Jackson with his pasty white face and effeminate demeanor, he infuses Willy with a dark side, which the screenwriters explain by showing us his repressed childhood (with a nice turn from Christopher Lee as his dentist father).  Add the gorgeous set pieces, the absurdly entertaining musical numbers by Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas and Depp's delightfully warped performance, and you have one strange and enjoyable movie.  The child actors are wonderful, especially Freddie Highmore as the titular Charlie and WINN DIXIE'S Annasophia Robb as the bubble gum chewing Violet.  David Kelly as grandpa and Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor as Charlie's parents are great too.  The musical score by Burton stalwart Danny Elfman is delightful; Elfman even does the singing for the Oompa Loompa songs with lyrics by the book's author, Dahl.  With no slant on Gene Wilder's original Willy, I found this movie much more enjoyable and visually stunning.
0060977493|4.0|I am glad that I did. I just re-read this (found it while I was moving). I loved being transported to another culture that was so very alien to me that often times I had to re-read a passage 2-3 times. This is what I think reading is really all about.
0812550757|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Orson Scott Card shows his ability to write about so many different topics in this series, and I think Speaker for the Dead perfectly captures Ender's sorrow. <br /> <br />amazing
B000BB1MHS|4.0|I have watched the old Charlie and the Chocolate a few times and I do enjoy it for it is a very imaginative and interesting story. Upon hearing a remake I was intrigued to see how well Depp could fill into the role Gene Wilder seemed to master. Definitely he did. I'm not surprised though because Depp always picks the riskiest of roles. While most actors only take a role or two that is a risk for their career, Depp takes them all the time in bold confidence and that is why he is one awesome actor. He is certainly worth watching in this film from his haircut to his humorous, quirky personality. Honestly though Depp makes you laugh in this film and he makes the Wonka role very believable as the eccentric he is. The others, the parents and the children actually played their roles well so I don't know what other reviewers are talking about- but indeed Willy Wonka was the one you always paid the most attention to.  <br />Now if you compare the two films, the older and this new version, there are differences you should know of. Now I don't really want to give away anything but there are differences you're going to point out but honestly they do not affect the story from its true storyline. Matter of fact, this film fills in a few gaps that the older version failed to give out, such as Wonka's past. This story is still very powerful and still very creative as the old one and worth the watch. Depp is someone certainly that needs to be watched- he is a natural when it comes to roles as these.  <br />If you want to watch a colorful, creative, and humorous film, this is the one to watch. I highly recommend it. Although I still think the older one is just a little better still (I give the older version a 4.5 and this a 4) I still find this a very good remake and again, definitely worth seeing.
0060825219|3.0|Was it intentional that the author left such a huge piece of the puzzle unmentioned in his last work? I have to think that it was. The correlation between his own longing for the reconnection of the deepest love he has ever known through his vanished ex-wife and the collective consciousness' thirst for the return of the Divine Feminine Energy was never directly implied by Coehlo, because he himself has yet to experience True Love. <br /> <br />Just how did this energy become so divine in the first place?  Through eons of pledges of undying love by lovers who were humbled by and understood the magnificent gift they were given; this love that set their hearts and bodies on fire. A love that could be tamed and kept alive if properly respected and honored. <br /> <br />It seems apparent that though Paulo's character (himself?) experienced a deep love for his wife, it had obviously not manifested to this deeper level of divine splendor, otherwise he would not have been so eager to feed this hunger with so many equally unfulfilling affairs. Even though both partners agreed to not discuss these extramarital adventures, the unspoken knowledge of this lack of divinely inspired love eventually eroded their marital bond.  The cells of the body know when they are being dishonored. <br /> <br />So, I bless this gifted author, who has given us so much and I hope that he will one day fully experience the return of the devastatingly erotic, purging and purifying beauty of the Beloved, and write to tell us about it! <br />
B000002UA9|3.0|Please Please Me is not a horrible album on any level. But compared to things to come, this is my least favorite. But It does have a few great songs.  <br />     I Saw Her Standing There. Now there's a great song. Anyone will like this simple McCartney Rocker. The next best track is Please Please Me. Mostly Lennon singing, with Paul and George on backups. John really seems to take advantage of that harmonica on this album, most notably on Love Me Do, The Beatles first huge hit. Another bigger one, Twist and Shout. Here we have paul and george backing up John who's rippin' those vocal cords. <br />     Not the best Beatle album to start with, and not the best over all, but it is essential to any fan, and it isn't to bad for a first album.
1400032717|3.0|I liked the book \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog..\\" although I didn't find it as brilliant as other reviewers have done. This novel brings the reader right into the world and thought process of the main character, an autistic boy named Christopher. Mark Haddon really gives the reader an insight into the world of autism. The narrator, Christopher, describes the book as a detective novel, however I believe it is really about facing your fears and doing things you didn't know you could. <br />I would recommend this book but don't have too high expectations when you start to read because it is easy to get disappointed...
B0002OERI0|1.0|I think that this album is extremely offensive.  Calling Americans idiots because they support their country is idiotic in itself.  They supported Kerry who would have put his tail between his legs and ran away from the terrorists if he would have won the election.  As for the Agitator who is supporting Skinny Puppy don't listen to him because that band staged a mock assassination of the president during their live shows and did a fake beheading.  Absolutely sickening.  And look at what the Agitator is saying about it in one of his reviews.  He says they have balls for doing it.  People who do suck idiotic things aren't brave.  They're cowards.  Don't give any of these bands your hard earned money.

B00097DXZS|5.0|Santana's new album All I Am is truly awesome.  While it doesn't immediately have a standout hit like Smooth on Supernatural, it keeps the spirit of that album alive continuing with some super collaborations.  This is an album that will get better with each listening!
B00024BHTC|4.0|You still haven't listened to this album? What are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and get it! That's the last one before the godess lead singer separation and just before you try to understand what happened with the band (I think it's a marketing strategy) pay attention to this 'ONCE'. This is heavier than the previous ones and the inclusion of different elements as a male singer (the bass player) is really interesting, although rumors say he entered the band to take Tarja's place and this album was only a kind of transition... the orchestra is wonderful, the lyrics are great: Planet Hell (#4), my favorite,  express the fear of mankind when they finally are aware of their responsibility in the dying process of the world. Tarja's voice is less lyrical and more metal and the guitars are strong. If you like Tristania and Theater of Tragedy, stop listening these craps and go listen the original and the real good one. It's so sad Tarja is out of the band... I think they will name their next album \\" *Once* Upon a Time\\" or maybe \\"We were just kidding!\\" . <br /> <br />Top3: Wish I Had An Angel (2), Planet Hell (4), The Siren (6).
B000AOENJA|2.0|David Gray's newest release Life in Slow Motion is just that, Slow.  I found it to be nice, pretty music, but it was way too slow for my liking.   <br /> <br />It also was not that memorable of an album.  After a listen, I could not look at the track listing and sing any memorable choruses.  It just didn't really impress me that much.   <br /> <br />The music itself is pretty and beautiful and he's got a great voice, but the album just isn't that special.  It lack that extra something that made White Ladder such a wonderful album.
B000AP04NI|2.0|It's been a while since I've written a review of a DVD, but I had to comment on this new 2-disc special edition of Oklahoma. First of all, it's wonderful to have the Cinemascope version available on DVD at last. This is the familiar version that I grew up with and watched (admittedly in pan-and-scan) on TV for years and years. Then in the mid-90s I heard about a \\"new\\" version of Oklahoma that had not been seen for years, filmed in Todd-AO. I eagerly rushed out and bought the laserdisc of this version, and brought it home. I was STUNNED! The picture was clear as crystal, sharply in focus and had almost a video-like clarity to it, due to the 30 frames-per-second Todd-AO process. The colors were sharper than I'd ever seen this movie in, and the sound was as if it had been recorded in a modern studio yesterday.<br /><br />Then a few years later the advent of DVD came about and I couldn't wait for the Todd-AO version to come out and knock the socks off the laserdisc transfer. Unfortunately, I was disappointed; while a lot of the clarity was still there I could tell a lot of the sharpness was lost in the digital transfer to DVD. The lack of an anamorphic picture was not a problem as I did not yet have a wide-screen HDTV; All in all, though, the laserdisc version still looked better.<br /><br />Then I bought my Sony 46\\" widescreen TV, and once again waited. . .thinking the next DVD version of Oklahoma would correct not only the problems with the digital transfer but will also be anamorphic, creating an even sharper image. Tonight I picked up the new 50th anniversary DVD. First I put on the Cinemascope version. It looked excellent!. . .much better than any previous version on video of the Cinemascope Oklahoma, including the Cinemascope laserdisc which was pretty fuzzy and faded. In anticipation I switched discs to the Todd-AO version. The first thing that worried me, though, was the fact that the Todd-AO version seems to be included as an \\"extra\\", along with all the other extras on the second disc. I started playing it and noticed the main titles seemed out of focus. Then the picture opened up on the corn field, that first shot that made me gasp with pleasure with that Todd-AO laserdisc I got 10 or so years ago. I definitely gasped again. . .with horror! Although the 30-fps smoothness of motion is still there, the colors are faded -- and worst of all, the entire picture is out of focus! This doesn't look anywhere NEAR 70mm quality; it doesn't even match the 35mm quality of the Cinemescope version! I have to agree with the poster that said this version needs to be recalled and remastered; it is one of the worst travesties I've seen in ANY video remaster, especially considering the wonderful picture of the LASERDISC 10 years ago! If you have the original DVD version of this, my advice is hang onto it until the Blu-Ray version comes out (although considering the history of these transfers that version will probably end up having the same quality as an old Little Rascals short. This one is darned close to that!)ras on the second disc. I started playing it and noticed the main titles seemed out of focus.

B0009VRHLK|1.0|Seriously - Reading the bad reviews of this movie were much more entertaining than the movie itself, and the actually plot could have easily condensed into a 15 minute short.  If you do watch the movie, don't watch it while you are tired because chances are you will fall asleep before anything even remotely interesting happens - in retrospect, perhaps that would be a good thing.
B00005KHEU|4.0|1979's \\"Discovery\\" was another smash album for the Electric Light Orchestra, a catchy confection of discofied pop-rock. For this album, the band had shrunk down from a sextet to a quartet, but musically Jeff Lynne & company were still at the top of their game with such irresistible classics as \\"Shine A Little Love,\\" \\"Last Train To London,\\" and \\"Don't Bring Me Down.\\" Other standouts include the humourous \\"Diary Of Horace Wimp\\" (a somewhat maligned track, but I think it's fun), and the beautiful \\"Wishing.\\" I don't understand the criticism of this album being \\"uneven\\"---as far as I'm concerned, \\"Discovery\\" is a great entry in the ELO catalog.
0895260131|4.0|Like most other Americans, I knew little about radical Islam before the shocking horrors of September 11, 2001. I probably knew a bit more about the religion in general thanks to a few history classes I took at the university. A course on the Crusades introduced me to Saladin and a rather neutered conception of jihad, and a survey class on world history covered the rise of Mohammed in the seventh century, the five pillars of faith, and the highs and lows of the Ottoman Empire. I learned more about how Islam operates as a ruling system when I read a few things about Albanian history. None of these classes or books mentioned Al-Qaeda or Osama Bin Laden. Nor did they talk about the number of extremely troubling verses in the Koran or the commentaries associated with that document.  If we had learned about these things, problematic questions certainly would have arose. Why does Islam seem to revolve around warfare and the subjugation of non-Muslim lands and peoples? Why the hostility to Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists? Robert Spencer, an expert on radical Islam, tries to answer these questions in \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam.\\" The book is an eye opening experience for those who always thought Islam a religion of peace.<br /><br />Spencer goes back to the earliest days of Islam, to the rise of the prophet Mohammed and the first teachings of Allah, and discovers that this religion bases most of its fundamental tenets on warfare against infidels. The Koran specifically tells followers that they must never take unbelievers as friends, must never trust unbelievers, and must always strive to spread Islam to lands populated by unbelievers. Treaties with non-Muslims are acceptable, but only as a means to regain strength in order to attack again later. Any method of overcoming the infidels is acceptable, including assassination and ambush. Islam does accept the presence of unbelievers, incredibly considering the endless references to war and conversion, but a host of oppressive laws and regulations ensures that Christians, Jews, and others (called \\"dhimmis\\" by Muslims) will never possess enough power to challenge Allah's hegemony. Spencer argues convincingly that history has shown that non-Islamic groups tend to gradually diminish in size and power the longer they live under the Muslim yoke. In other words, forget about multiculturalism, pluralism, and western conceptions of civil rights under an Islamic state. They don't exist because the main goal of Islam is to make the entire world Islamic. Period.<br /><br />\\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam\\" goes on to discuss the Crusades in some depth. The standard explanation of these historical events in our universities, according to Spencer, leaves much to be desired. Professors and organizations espousing political correctness try to paint the Crusades as an attempt by the West to colonize the Middle East, or as religious wars aimed at forcibly converting the Muslim world to Christianity. Not so. They were, in fact, a concerted effort by Europe to roll back centuries of jihad expansion into Christian territories. Moreover, once the crusaders established states in the Levant, they made little effort to convert the native population to Christ. Anyone remotely familiar with European history ought to know this. As late as the seventeenth century, Islamic forces were attempting to penetrate deep into the heart of Europe. The Battle of Vienna in 1683, where Polish forces repulsed a Muslim army, represented the last great jihad into Europe. Until now. As the last part of the book relates, the new jihad has taken on different forms. Massive Muslim immigration into Europe has given the jihadists of Al-Qaeda many recruits to fashion a new army and thus finally bring a significant portion of the West to Allah.<br /><br />I generally liked Spencer's book. He not only covers many of the fundamental beliefs and history of Islamic expansion, but also calls attention to the horrible treatment of women in many Muslim societies. Sidebars in the text often call attention to the difference between Christianity and Islam by placing quotations from the New Testament next to ones pulled from the Koran. Several \\"Books You're Not Supposed to Read\\" sidebars point the reader to further titles that will better explain key points. I commend the author for taking great pains in pointing out the differences between moderate Muslims and the radical fringe. Spencer acknowledges that many Muslims don't advocate violent jihad against the West, nor do they support suicide bombings or the other atrocities carried out by Hezbollah, Hamas, and Al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, he believes that trouble will exist as long as war against \\"infidels\\" lies at the center of Koranic teaching. The author laments the fact that moderates have not made an appreciable dent in their efforts to recast the Koran in a better, more peaceful light. If this book is any indication, we've got a long stretch ahead of us if we wish to defeat radical Islam wherever it exists.<br /><br />\\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam\\" stumbles in spots. For example, referring to Meir Kahane as an Israeli \\"political activist\\" doesn't tell the whole story. Kahane was a Jewish supremacist and supporter of a \\"Greater Israel\\" whose government labeled one of his organizations as racist and banned it from the Knesset. The United States declared his other group, the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a terrorist organization and jailed many of its members for acts of violence against the Muslim community. Another problem in the book is the tendency to ignore extremely hostile comments found in Christian and Jewish writings. A close reading of the Talmud, for example, will uncover several horrific statements about gentiles. Nonetheless, Spencer's book is a must read in this day and age. Don't let the government and America hating academics define Islam for you. Read a wide range of books and make up your own mind.the horrible treatment of women in many Muslim societies.

B000022TSH|5.0|This review is for the 1999 Paramount DVD.    The story starts with private investigator Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) being hired by a concerned wife to see if her husband, Hollis Mulwray, a chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water Department is having an affair.  After several days of non-stop detective work, Gittes finds out that Mulwray is involved in a controversial water supply project.  Finally, the surveillance pays off with Gittes photographing Mulwray with a woman in a compromising position.  Mulwray later turns up dead from an apparent drowning, but soon after Gittes finds out a lot things just aren't what they seem including the death of Mulwray, the politics surrounding the local water project, and motive for the initial detective work monitoring Mulwray.  This sets up the reminder of the film where Gittes deals with plenty of powerful, corrupt and dangerous people to find out what really happened to Mulwray and why.    The color widescreen presentation is a visual feast for the eyes from start to finish.  The story takes place in 1930's Los Angeles and even for being released in 1974, the attention to detail for making it seem true to that era is utterly amazing.   But the film is still more than a powerful retro-noir movie.  The acting by the three main characters: Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston is magnificent.  Nicholson's role is one that it seems like we seen dozens of times - an urban detective getting sucked into more then he bargained for and getting roughed up and used as a patsy, but Nicholson does it better than anyone before or since.  The screenplay also works brilliantly as every scene is fascinating and rarely predictable.  The ending does get a little weird and even provokes some controversy as it goes into a taboo subject, but what else could one expect from a film directed by Roman Polanski.  Chinatown is a must-see movie for anyone who appreciates beautifully filmed, well acted pictures.  This DVD is an essential addition to any serious film enthusiast's library.  I've seen this movie at least 5 times, twice on DVD, and it never gets old!    As for the DVD itself, the 16x9 widescreen presentation is overall excellent but not quite perfect as occasional micro-spots of film deterioration could be observed once in a while.  The picture seemed adequately sharp, but did not seem to razor sharp as some other releases I've seen from that era.  The stereo sound is also top-notch.  The only bonuses are a trailer and a brief interview with the three main people behind the film: writer Robert Towne, producer Robert Evans and director Roman Polanski who is currently exiled from America for having sex with a minor in the late '70's.      Movie:  A+    DVD Quality: A-

B000B5IOUW|5.0|I was a little worried about watching a film this visual on such a small screen, but the sound is amazing and makes it feel wide open and less confined.  I know there are plenty of people who love to bash this film ( you love it or hate it).  But I can't think of any other movies of last year that actually stuck with me so long after I'd seen the film.  Not for kids, but I use it as my demo disc to show friends my system.  Great acting and direction, and for once, a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and is uniquely UNPREDICTABLE.

And you know the things that Diamond are talking about are never the people.  His assertion that all races are equal never has to be said.  That's how hard he holds the line.<br /><br />  But the things that the different people are granted in their place in the world are all important.

B00005JNJV|2.0|Alot of people are going to disagree with me, but hey, controversy rules....I found myself looking at my watch about an hour into this. Mr. Bale, who was a complete stud in American Psycho, didn't get much too work with here, and thats a shame cuz' the kid can act. I adored the 1st Batman, that's a 4.5 star movie, easy, Michael Keaton and of course Jack Nicholson made that movie so much fun. Unfortunately, Bale and Liam Neeson don't have any of the chemistry that Mike and Jack had, even Clooney and Arnold had more chemistry, which is kinda sad when you think of it.<br /><br />I didn't care for any of the explanations on how he came to use bats, how he learned his \\"art\\" even the scene with his parents did not work for me cuz we saw the same scene in the first movie done much better with Jack robbing his folks and blowing them away.<br /><br />This did not get 1 star thanks to Michael Caine, this man rarely makes a bad movie, and even though I really did not care for this, he was still wonderfull, very funny, and really shined and made me forget that this was a different actor playing Alfred.<br /><br />I know alot of you loved this movie, saying it revitalized the franchise, but I disagree, I'm Batman'd out, we've had four different Batman's, two diffrent Alfred's, three different mayor's, a couple of different Gordon's, enough is enough, let it end here, please.<br /><br />acting..........2.5 stars, Michael Caine still rules, Bale is stale<br /><br />directing.......2.5 stars, Rather surprising from the Memento director<br /><br />special effects....3 stars.

B000001TVD|5.0|To give a forword, let me say that I'm not a particular funk fan. Many songs are reminiscent of Sly Stone, whom I did like, but this comment is about the title track. <br />In college in the early 70's, I heard the song 'Maggot Brain' and bought the album. I fell in love with the title track, and I still love it! <br />For those who have compared this to Hendrix, I say you can't. Hendrix took all music of this type to another level, and stands alone. <br />Yes, some of the song 'Maggot Brain' has Hendrix' inflections, and brilliantly so. Others have done so in a similar manner. HOWEVER: for me this is not a matter of comparison. In this song Eddie Hazel, Geo Clinton, and Funkadelic have recorded a masterpiece. One of those recorded moments that will always be a credit to it's participants. <br />Let's just agree that both Hendrix and Hazel left their mark in this world as phenomenal guitarists, and did their own thing. And did it extremely well!

B000BW7QX6|4.0|I loved the series and I loved this movie. I won't go into plot points here b/c so many others have. When I heard about the movie being a reality I was excited, but grew very worried when I saw the uninspiring trailers (all, what, two of them - sheesh). When I saw the movie the first time on opening night, I was stunned and thrilled. It exceeded my expectations, both as a fan and a movie-goer.<br /><br />I ended up seeing the movie an embarrassing number of times in the theatre. The only time I did not thoroughly enjoy it was when some inconsiderate fan kept talking (so going to the Special Hell). It isn't perfect (what is?), it definitely takes more than one viewing to catch everything, it isn't for folk who slip into a coma if something isn't exploding every five minutes, it isn't for folk who need to be hit over the head with CGI, and someone familiar with the series would probably get more out of it (but hey, they sell that here too!). Qualifiers aside, it was the most entertained I remember being in a theatre - maybe ever.<br /><br />A lot of the other reviews have covered the good points of the film. I just want to re-iterate one: the main strength of this film is the characters. As an avid reader of everything from comic books to literature, I can state without hesitation that I believe Malcolm Reynolds is one of the best fictional characters ever created. I can't imagine anyone but Nathan Fillion playing him, b/c he does it so well. I would also like to address the few people who claim the movie was predictable. I had seen every episode in the series, most more than once, prior to seeing the movie and I was surprised by every plot twist. It is inconceivable to me that anyone could honestly call this movie predictable.<br /><br />If you have never seen Firefly or Serenity, remember that popularity and commercial success are not necessarily measures of quality nor can they predict how you personally will react to a movie. Nothing pleases all, but most of the folk who saw this movie enjoyed it (even newbies). It got an 80% (subject to change) on the Tomatometer (87% from the Cream of the Crop critics) and was Certified Fresh with over one hundred reviews. Last I checked, it had a B+ (users) on Yahoo movies with over 17,000 reviews. The series has been an Amazon top seller for a ridiculously long time. Not bad for a tv show/movie about \\"cowboys in space speaking Chinese\\" with no big-name stars. It's weird, it works, and it's wonderful. Those who can't get it don't, but those who do fall in love for life.<br /><br />All praise aside, when I get this DVD, I will be pulling out the abominable, misleading cover art, shredding it, and generating my own insert with my trusty PC.

B00003CXMG|5.0|This film is great. It is painfully funny, serious, sad, cutting, relateable. And the music's great too. It is certainly worth your time. The story's great, it's such a deep, heartfelt film, so real, and at the end you have a new perspective, as the journey of life flows on, that everything will be alright. What happened to the good old days? They got captured in this film. Cameron Crowe knows what he's doing, just let him show you with this film.

In the late 80s, the Sugarcubes put Iceland on the map for quirky, sophisticated alternative pop.  Meanwhile Sonic Youth was busy making a name for themselves with a raw freeform sound full of guitar feedback and other experiments in dischord.    In the late 80s/early 90s a breakthrough band emerged to marry the ethereal Cocteau Twins sound with the discord of Sonic Youth.  This was the amazing but short-lived My Bloody Valentine.    On the heels of all these bands comes the next big thing out of Iceland, Sigur Ros.  Radiohead and Enya might naturally come to mind also, as one drifts through this beautiful soundscape.  Sigur Ros is definitely worth exploring, and this is perhaps the best album to start your journey.
B000025H0Q|5.0|My first on Drake's 3 lone albums comes to be my favorite. Not as bleak and quiet as Pink Moon nor jazzy and plain as in Five Leaves. The songs can range from a light airy pop of Hazy Jane 2 to a dark but enlighting Northern Sky. The instermentals are a little comteperary with a flute guiding the songs along. But probably the warm guitar and and drifting piano that is on Poorboy makes it my favorite song. This album is great to by played on a cloudy chilly day,well probably all Drake's albums are superb for that partiular kind of day.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Amazing! <br />I had enjoyed the orginial version of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, and had been sceptical of this new version.  <br />But, it is a Tim Burton film, and has some very Tim Burton elements--wild sets and camera angles that no other director seems to really handle as well.  <br />Johnny Depp once again proves his prowice as an actor. This man is not limited to one type of character or film, he can do it all! And he's amazing. His Wonka is quirky, but there is a dark side to this man. The dialogue is witty, some of it ridiculously so, but still all together hillarious!  <br />The ending is wonderful, I actually prefer it over the ending of the older version. It gives Wonka a more dynamic characterization as well as an interesting background that draws the view to feel sorry for him.  <br />I loved it!
B00028HBKC|5.0|I loved this movie so much. mel gibson did a good job showing what Jesus went though for our sins and the loved that he has for each one of us. I didn't find it too violent and I'm glad that showed the violence to give you a picture that what Jesus did wasn't an easy thing to do but he did it so we can get to heaven and that he loves us so much even if we are a sinner and that there hope for us through him. I hope Mel Gibson will be making more religious movies because this one is the best.
B00030590I|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />The Hollywood action crowd could learn a thing or two from \\"Hero,\\" a martial arts picture that tells a complex story to go along with its fight scenes and generates one unforgettable image after another.<br /><br />Set in the period before China became a united kingdom, \\"Hero\\" deals with such classic themes as courage, self-sacrifice, honor, revenge and romantic passion, and does so on a scale that is both intimate and epic.  In this tale about the founding of a nation, the protagonist is a master swordsman, known only as \\"Nameless,\\" who is either an assassin of other would-be assassins who are out to kill a king, or an assassin bent on killing the king himself.  The beauty of the story is that it unfolds in the form of a mystery, almost \\"Rashomon\\"-like in the way it views the same incidents from the differing and often contradictory perspectives of various characters, some of them eyewitnesses to the events and others spinning tales out of pure speculation.  Like the images in a kaleidoscope, the plot points are constantly grouping, then falling to pieces, then re-grouping into other patterns until a full-blown picture of the entire story at last emerges.<br /><br />The kaleidoscope analogy is a fitting one, for it is in its visuals that \\"Hero\\" truly becomes a masterpiece.  The film is like an artist's canvas brought brilliantly to life, a canvas covered with the most vivid and eye-popping colors imaginable.  Whether it's the sight of huge armies marching against impressive landscapes, their flags of war fluttering in the breeze, or thousands upon thousands of arrows soaring through the air in a literal rain of death, or a beautifully choreographed fight scene in a meadow strewn with impossibly yellow and red autumn leaves, \\"Hero\\"'s imagery makes an indelible impression on the viewer.  As is the custom with many recent Chinese films, the swordfight scenes have been turned into slow motion ballets, with the participants defying gravity by flying effortlessly through the air to unimaginable heights.  This emphasis on the surreal gives the film the mythic quality it needs to tells its ancient tale.<br /><br />Yet, even with all its visual sumptuousness, \\"Hero\\" never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a story about people - their lives, their loves, and the conflicts they face as they play out the roles assigned to them by history.  Rather than getting buried under all the visuals, the characters are able to stand out from the background and make their mark on the viewer's heart.  This is helped immeasurably by the fine performances from Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Maggie Cheung among others.<br /><br />Kudos to writers Feng Li and Bin Wang, director Yimou Zhang, cinematographer Christopher Doyle, costume designer Emi Wada and all the other talented artists who have had a hand in crafting one of the most visually exquisite and intellectually satisfying films in recent memory.

0142004235|5.0|Powerful, Compelling, Timeless <br />        John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a powerful novel that takes an in-depth look at the inward struggle of good vs. evil that goes on within all people.  Set in the 1930s, East of Eden is a vivid and realistic portrayal of life in the southwest during that time.  This novel deserves as much praise as its predecessor Grapes of Wrath.  <br /> The characters that Steinbeck created in his novel are strong and intriguing.  While the plotline lagged at times, the characters compelled me to continue reading.  Three of the best drawn and most important characters in the story are Adam, Cal, and Cathy.  Adam is an army veteran.  He has a good heart, and an innocent outlook which leads him to marry a woman who not only doesn't love him, but eventually shoots him and leaves him for dead.  His son Cal also has a good heart, but he often struggles with it and finds himself praying to be more like his brother Aron, who never experiences any kinds of inner turmoil.  Cathy is Adam's wife, and from her first appearance in the book is described as a cold hearted monster.  On pg.95 Steinbeck writes while introducing her character, \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies... And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born?  The face and body may be perfect but if a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\"  While Cathy is well developed, her character is never totally understood.  For example, what drives her and where her unremorseful cruelty comes from is never revealed, it is only suggested that these were characteristics that she was born with, not characteristics that developed over time.  Steinbeck writes of her on pg.96 \\"It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies, or lack of them, which drove and forced her allher life.\\"          <br />        One of the most interesting things about East of Eden, is its new spin on two of the words most ancient biblical stories; Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel.  Adam and Eve is about the first two humans and their banishment from the garden of Eden after disobeying God.  In East of Eden, Adam and Cathy's relationship parallels that of Adam and Eve.  In the book Adam moves a pregnant Cathy to Salinas Valley, California, where he buys a huge plot of land and begins to create a gigantic garden on it.  But when Cathy decides that she can no longer stand her life with Adam, she leaves him, which subsequently results in the deterioration of the garden that Adam was trying to make.  Adam loses his Eve, (Cathy) and because of it, his garden and life turn from heavenly to hellish.      <br />        Cain and Abel is about two brothers who both make an offering to God, but only one of the offerings, Abel's, is accepted, while Cain is told to do better. Feeling that he's been rejected by God, Cain becomes angry and kills Abel.  In East of Eden, the relationships of both Adam and Charles, and Cal and Aron, parallel that of Cain and Abel.  Charles becomes jealous and attempts, (though does not succeed,) to kill his brother Adam with a hatchet because their father loves him more.  Cal becomes jealous of Aron for the same reason, only in this case Cal's actions towards his brother are indirectly responsible for his death.  In both situations the breaking point occurred when the fathers either preferred one of their son's gifts over the other's, or rejected one of their son's gifts while accepting the other son's.  Taking these two stories, (Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel) which some people can't connect with, and weaving them into a plot with characters which the reader can't help but connect with, was very captivating.         <br /> A main theme in this novel is relationships, mainly those between fathers and sons, and brothers.  Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing an honest account of the jealousy that can arise between siblings as a result of having a parent who favors one of them over the other.  The various emotions and driving factors that were touched on while exploring these relationships were true to form and something that anyone who has brothers or sisters can personally understand.     <br /> East of Eden was moving and left a solid imprint in my mind.  Steinbeck succeeded in writing an unforgettable novel. It is truly worthy of a second read.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Recently my Songs from the Wood cd was stolen.  I was happy that a you could get this cd so cheap, but you get much more than that.  A remastered cd and a live version of Velvet Green, possible the best track on Songs from the Wood.  If you like Jethro Tull get your hands on this cd cause there is no bad track on the album and you get Velvet Green played live.
1400034779|3.0|<br /> I wanted to read this book ever since I read a book review of it on the 'Time'. I was curious as to how fun, witty it would be, and whether it deserved all the compliments. The book didn't reach my expectations, but it was still an interesting read. The dissatisfaction I felt came partly from the fact that it was so predictable, so undiverging from the rules of good. The banal boo-hoo story of a violent husband and the trauma. The peccadilloes of uninteresting people, and Mz. Ramotswe's unsurprising solutions. The book lacked one very important element essential to make it breathe, to draw the reader in and make him laugh and cry with the story; it lacked charisma of the characters. I need a character who somehow touches my heart in any way, to make me appreciate the book to its full. Another fault was that the literary style had no flavor; it was so ordinary. However, I have been concentrating on its small faults; overall, the events were interesting and the book wasn't bad. <br /> <br /> The heroine is Mma Ramotswe, who sets up a detective agency after her father's death, with the money from the sales of his legacy of cows. She solves various cases that smell of Africa brought to her by people leading ordinary lives in Africa.
B00005JOGU|3.0|Maybe what Truman Capote meant by the term, 'In Cold Blood', was in regard to his own perception and investigation of the murder of the Kansas farm family, The Clutters, in 1959. His assuredly manipulative means of extracting the story from convicted murderer, Perry Smith, doesn't so much question the ethics of a reporter butter stroking his subject in exchange for information, as I have heard of this film, but instead justifies a very excellent investigative reporter feeding the public's insatiable desire to know what happened that night in November, 1959. A grim and profound task for any writer, and one that will surely have a life long effect, but one could argue that Capote was long on his way to becoming a drunk before \\"In Cold Blood\\". This acclaimed drama, with a lurid and fascinating subject matter, is really just a paler version of Richard Brooks' 1967 filming of Capote's book, that featured, of all people, Robert Blake as the convicted murderer. While Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Capote is masterful in mannerisms, it is still just a superficial, albeit superb, characterization of a quirky, sensitive writer displayed through outlandish vocal and physical gestures. A writer 'writes', and watching one work does not make great cinema. It is the murders, not so much Capote, that fascinates us, and the film offers the story of \\"In Cold Blood\\" in much the same way as the original film except with it's writer directing traffic at the center. Yet, it's just about worth it to hear Hoffman, portraying Capote, sipping a drink, while muttering a put-down of his friend, Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
B000AQBA1W|4.0|I panned \\"Borrowed Heaven\\", (even though I think The Corrs are an exceptionally talented group of musicians and songwriters), because it sucked.  Some of the other reviewers did the same and felt that the group should return to their roots, that is that sort of blend of Irish music and pop music.  Fortunately, The Corrs listened (well, kind of sort of).    The Corrs made an outstanding effort this time and created a very good, solid CD.  Make no mistake; the music on this CD is very different from other Corrs' efforts like \\"In Blue\\" and \\"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\\", which are that Corrs' blend of pop and Irish.  If you are expecting or hoping \\"Home\\" to be something like or even close to \\"In Blue\\" and so forth, you may not like this CD.  The music on this CD is more a mixture of traditional Irish sounding folk songs and jigs but with a Corrs' twist.  While I miss Sharon's beautiful voice in background vocals (I often just sing or hum Sharon's part of the vocals when listening to some of the older Corrs' songs), I can live with this effort because The Corrs have put together some very beautiful songs.  For a great pleasure in life, listen to this CD while sitting in a comfortable chair in front of a warm fire on a cold day sipping a pint of Guinness.    My only criticism, if you want to call it that, is with the inclusion of the song \\"Old Town\\".  I am not sure from where the band's obsession with this song comes, but the song does not quite fit with the other music on this CD.  They should have left this one at home on \\"Unplugged\\".    All in all, the CD is worth the cash.      ADDENDUM:  Since I wrote this review, I have had an opportunity to listen to this CD many, many times.  The more I listen, the more I like.  If I could, I would change my rating from a 4 to a 5 star and highly recommend the CD as a strong buy.  I absolutely love the songs in Gaelic.
B000B19BCG|5.0|Secate li se velicanstvenih '90., kada su scenom vladali Blur, Pulp, Oasis i Supergrass? <br />Pulp nazalost vise nepostoje, Oasis postoje ali bolje da ne jer posle albuma Be Here Now nista dobro nisu uradili, Blur se jos uvek dobro drze, a tu su i Supergrass koji su se vratili sa albumom Road To Rouen. <br />Supergrass definitivno su se odaljili od pop forme, i na ovom albumu nema ni jedne catchy pesme osim instrumentala Coffee In The Pot, ali melodicnosti svakako ima. <br />Beskrajno nezan i iskren, ovaj album zasluzuje vasu paznju. Jedan od najboljih izdanja koje nam je pruzila ova godina.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Absolutely stunning.  This is back to basics for DM; for fun I listened to \\"Black Celebration\\" (My favorite) after listning to \\"Playing the Angel\\" and to me, it seemed like the two could have been recorded back to back. <br /> <br />In my opinion, \\"Precious\\" is probably the weakest track on this album/CD.   My fav, \\"John The Revelator\\", my synth driven husband's \\"Nothing's Impossible\\". <br /> <br />
068484267X|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite novels.  I had my English Honors class read it for their summer reading assignment and they absolutely LOVED it.  Usually the kids don't do their summer reading, but they devoured this book.  The story is such a gutwrenching sad one, but it was Frank's reality growing up.  The conditions in which he lived were unthinkable, and he does such a wonderful job of detailing them for the reader.  You feel so attached to Frankie and his siblings, and you really develop emotions for his mother and his drunk of a father.  It really makes you just want to take this family in and care for them.  I recommend this book to anyone...it is truly a magnificent piece of literature.
1401301363|5.0|In \\"Feast\\", Nigella Lawson not only explores how food is used to celebrate life through a diverse range of cultures and traditions - she also reveals herself as one of the finest and most moving food writers since MFK Fisher.  Her chapter and recipe introductions are frequently as absorbing (and mouth-watering) as the recipes themselves.<br /><br /> The recipes offer a good range from the simple (Ritzy Chicken Nuggets = chicken strips marinated in buttermilk and coated in Ritz cracker crumbs!) to the more complex (= fruited and brined turkey, which I look forward to trying this Thanksgiving).  Her conversational style makes every recipe tempting and easy to follow, and most of them contain less than a dozen ingredients (usually considerably less than a dozen); I'm not really sure how anyone could be confused or intimidated by anything in this book.<br /><br />As far as some of the other reviews here are concerned: I, too, was perplexed by the misprint regarding butter in the flourless chocolate orange cake recipe (which shouldn't keep anyone from trying to make it - it is otherwise as simple as it is exquisite).  And those who have a problem with Nigella's remarks about Jewish food and culture should go back and read the book a little more closely: Nigella is well acquainted with Jewish culture and culinary history, and her remarks are meant to illustrate that there is no such thing as a single \\"Jewish cuisine\\", but rather a range of culinary traditions (Ashkenazi, Sephardic, etc.) that often get lumped together.<br /><br />All in all, one of the most treasured books in my 200+ cookbook collection, and one I look forward to turning to over and over again in the coming years.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|Robbie Williams is like a drug: addictive, irresistible. He rips off every other pop and rock sound and, with Stephen Duffy, transforms it into intoxicating pop songs. He knows where his bread is buttered, but sometimes goes too far to ensure devotion. Straight women and gay men love Robbie, but he sometimes tries too hard for their vote. Each album has a requisite maudlin grandma song and gay romp, and they fail every time. Robbie does his best when he just crafts a tasty pop song. His lyrics either make you feel like he's writing just for you--or for himself. He's a much better rocker than he admits, and frequently his rocking tracks (like A Place to Crash) that he's tossed off are better than his carefully constructed dance tunes. Ultimately, Robbie won't ever be famous in the U.S. because he's too good. --A US fan since 1999
B00023B1LC|4.0|As an actor, Matt Damon is a little like the great Jeff Bridges, in that he keeps on quietly giving smart performances in movies that seem to tastefully resist the urge to grab you by the lapels and shout at you.  (One of these days, maybe Damon will do a comedic turn to match Jeff Bridges' brilliant, hilarious riffing as The Dude in the otherwise ridiculous \\"The Big Lebowski.\\")   <br /> <br />This is a tight, cool little action thriller with a lot of good, quasi-realistic fighting (so much more satisfying than bombastic Hollywood overkill, or the increasingly ludicrous flying and wirework that comes out of the Chinese martial-arts world).  The whole action sequence in the embassy is just perfectly rendered (even though it doesn't contribute much to the story).  So is the fight in the apartment.  Way to go! <br /> <br />Damon as Jason Bourne is pretty cool and convincing, and it would be nice if he could become the 'new James Bond,' but I doubt that will happen because: 1) the whole existential-loner-without-a-cause trip is just not as much fun as blowing up Doctor No or Ernst Blofeld; and 2) let's face it, 'Jason Bourne' just isn't nearly as cool a name as James Bond. <br /> <br />The one real problem with the movie is that the ostensible 'cause' of Bourne's amnesia is so rigged, so artificially constructed in order to place itself beyond reproach or criticism, that it's just not satisfying, and certainly not a good solution to the puzzle.  Then again, the puzzle is never really so important to this movie; it's all about the good performances, the tight filming, and those cool fights. <br /> <br />[BONUS OPINIONATED BLATHER:  The DVD extras contain some peculiar hand-wringing about 9/11, and the idea that our country's CIA-sponsored international subterfuge and so-called \\"Black Ops\\" were once considered evil, but are now just hunky-dory.  This is problematic.  I am certainly no apologist for terrorists, and I believe in a clear-eyed and strong approach to confronting global terrorism (hey, listen, like it or not, we DO need a CIA); but it's important to recognize that our whole \\"Black Ops\\"-style policy was a large contributing factor to the current mess as it grows and spreads.  Let's at least own up to that, and acknowledge the complexity of things -- and as we work to make ourselves safer in the world, we might also try working harder to make ourselves less hated.  This doesn't mean we have to be weak and spineless; but it does mean we should take a good, hard look at plenty of stuff, and be honest about it.] <br />     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
079284632X|1.0|I unfortunately saw this movie at a drive in theater (obviously a long time ago) and could not leave.  I still have nightmares  about it and truly wish the film had never been made.  The only reason I am writing this tonight is because a friend wanted me to watch it and I showed him the other reviews on this site.  He changed his mind thanks to all of you.
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen is my overall favorite band, so for me to say that one of their albums is better than the rest is very difficult. Still, I could sit down and listen to this album straight through every day and never grow tired of it. First, let me advise anyone who may buy this album to listen to it straight through, in it's entirety, without interruption if possible. There are very many styles of music contained on this album, and the individual songs are arranged perfectly in relation to one another. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with \\"Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...).\\" This song leads in with a light piano bit, but quickly changes to a hard-rocking masterpeice. The song is meant for Queen's managers at the time, Trident Studios, because the members of the band did not feel that they recieved enough money for their first hit, \\"KIller Queen.\\" This would be Queens last album with Trident Studios. <br /> <br />The transition to the next song flows wonderfully into \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.\\" This song is as stark a contrast possible to the previous song. The word that best describes it is \\"playful.\\" Songs like this help us to see that a band is not taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br />The next song is, in my opinion, one of the two weak songs on the album. \\"I'm in Love With My Car\\" is another hard rocker, with Roger Taylor providing the vocals. Taylor has a wonderful voice, but I think this song lacks that something that the rest of the album has. A better example of Taylor's singing can be found on the album \\"Queen II\\" in the song \\"The Loser in the End.\\" <br /> <br />The fourth song is another great change of pace from it's preceding song. \\"You're My Best Friend\\" is one of two big hits written by John Deacon, the other being \\"Another One Bites the Dust.\\" This is a beautiful song that goes hand in hand with a later track, \\"Love of My Life.\\" <br /> <br />\\"'39\\" is not really compareable to any other song that Queen has done. It is sung by Brian May, who also has a wonderful voice. The guitar in this song is great, and the harmonic vocals work wonderfully. <br /> <br />The next song is the second of what I beleive are the two weak songs on this album. the song is \\"Sweet Lady,\\" and it another hard-rocker. This is the one song on the album that i find myself daydreaming through. A good song, just not when compared to the rest of this album. <br /> <br />The next song is the sequal to \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.\\" \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" is another wonderfully playful song that is perfectly placed between two very hard-styled songs. The most wonderful part of this song is the kazoo solo in the middle. What other band would give you a kazoo solo? <br /> <br />This next song is my absolute favorite Queen song, period. The song \\"The Prophets Song\\" is over eight minutes long, and has never been treated with the respect that, in my opinion, it deserves. The song starts quietly with the soft sounds of the ocean, and soon a few notes of instramentation are added before Freddie starts to sing. The vocal melody throughout the song is woderful, as is the insramental harmony. About three minutes and twenty seconds into the song, the instaments stop, and Freddie starts to sing, bringing hos voice to the absolute maximum hihg notes that he can hit. But this is not just a regular vocal solo, thanks to the miracles of track overlay, this bit is laid over the top of itself, so that Freddie is now singing a round with himself. This bit is exceptionally written, as every change in one of the three vocal parts creates a perfect harmony with the others. Also, toward the end, he starts to repeat the phrase \\"Listen to the wise,\\" and he enunciates the cosonants so well, that it actually sounds as if there are snare drums backing him up. This is an extraordinary song and deserves far more credit than it recieves. <br /> <br />The next song is the second slow, beatiful song on this album. The song is \\"Love of My Life,\\" and it would later become a staple of Queen's live performances. During these performances, Freddie would sing the song as a duet with the audience, the only acompniment coming from May's acoustic guitar. <br /> <br />Next is \\"Good Company.\\" I like to play a little game with this song, play it for someone, but do not tell them what it is, or who sings it. Then ask them who they think probably sings it. The most likely response is \\"The Beatles.\\" This song is in the same, rather goofy style as the beatles are known for. The vocals don't sound esspecially like Paul or John, but the style of the song is enough to be convincing. <br /> <br />\\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" I'm not going to try to explain or even say anything about this song. You have undoubtably heard it, and even if it annoys you, you have to admit it's origonality and power. One thing I will say is bravo to Queen for putting this right at the end of the album. Too often the best songs on an album will be right in the begining, and the album flows downhill from there. Now imagine this album has just come out, and you have never heard of Bohemian Rhapsody, and don;t know what it is. Imagine thinking that this album is winding down to it's end, only to be hit by this song. The final touch to the perfect arrangement of songs. <br /> <br />The album closes on the song that closed so many Queen concerts, \\"God Save the Queen.\\" Not a song that stands on it's own, but a great way to wrap things up. This is a rock-instramental version of a British patriotic song, much like Jimi Hendrix did \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" A great idea, especially considering that it would have been neer impossible to follow \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" with anything. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is incredible. It is my favorite album ever (yes, even better than Abbey Road), containing my favorite song ever, by my favorite band ever. This is a must for anyone who thinks they like Queen, and especially anyone who considers themself a Queen fan.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining, exciting historical epic with great special effects, production values and especially wonderful performances from Crowe, Reed and Nielsen.  Obvious care and affection went into even the smallest details and it shows with a moving and emotional story.  A winner on every level!
B000000OAC|3.0|I love Queen. They are my favorite band, but I don't understand why so many people feel that this is their best, or one of their best albums. I understand that it contains as many different genres of music as have ever been packed onto one album, and that this album contains the invention of arena rock (\\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We Are the Champions\\"). However, two great songs cannot make an entire album great, not to mention the fact that until this album, Queen had almost always saved at least of of the album's better songs for the end, an here they get rid of the best two songs right at the begining. <br /> <br />Also, Queen has always incorperated many different genres into their music, but here, instead of mixing them to form new sound, they made the most cliche sounding songs possible for each genre. There are a couple of punk songs, the worst of which is \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", there is a classic blues song (\\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\"), an island melody (\\"Who Needs You\\"), and a lounge-style jazz song (\\"My Melancholy Blues\\"). None of these songs are innovative in any way. It's as if Queen was tryingto say, \\"Hey, look at all the genres of music we can do.\\" On top of those, \\"Fight From the Inside\\" and \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" are fairly boring. \\"Fight From the Inside\\" also seems to be a pure reincarnation of Taylor's \\"Loser in the End\\" off of \\"Queen II\\". <br /> <br />Other than these, I liked \\"Spread Your Wings\\", but the melody at the beging is borrowed from the Beatles' \\"Rocky Racoon\\". Also, the piano and the melody to \\"All Dead\\" are great, but the chorus is so blad, it keeps the song from being great. My favorite song off the album (other than the first two) is \\"It's Late\\". This song has the power that was in earlier albums, but is sincerely lacking in this one. Still, it is different than what they had done on previous albums. <br /> <br />I guess i just don' think this ablum is as creative as Queen has the capibility of being. The four songs i mentioned earlier that were simple cliches of their genre could have been written by absolutely anyone. If you want a truely great example of Queen's early work, check out \\"A Night at the Opera\\".
B00001NFCY|4.0|Funny thing about this album is that I'm sure most people will judge it by the infamous songs that were released to radio and subjected to airwave saturation - \\"Higher\\", \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and jeez, I can't even remember the other one. <br /> <br />But the thing is that they are the absolute worst songs on the CD.  The only ones that I skip over, they are.  The rest of the album?  Pure rock and surprisingly heavy when compared to their earlier effort, \\"My Own Prison\\".  I still dust this album off from time to time and enjoy it to this day. <br /> <br />Others out there who like to make PJ comparisons need to knock it off.  Pearl Jam is one of my favourite bands and I've seen them a few times live (along with Creed) and I honestly can't see any sort of similarity between the bands whatsoever.  Okay, so maybe Scott Stapp might channel a bit of Vedder every once in a while but musically Creed and PJ (and STP for that matter) are on complete opposite ends of the spectrum (musically, rhythmically and they all deal with completely different subject matter lyrically). <br /> <br />Other than that, I hate commercially pre-packaged radio-friendly garbage just as much as the other guy but I really do enjoy those Creed songs where you mention them and people are like \\"huh?\\".  I love it!  Great album...
B000BB1MI2|1.0|Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is a disgrace.  This once-beloved character has been turned into a psychotic, parent-hating, extremely juvenile, WEIRDO. <br /> <br />My young daughter has had nightmares about \\"little squirrels\\" EVERY NIGHT since seeing this film over the summer.  In this version of the film, squirrels attack Veruca Salt and throw her into a hole. <br /> <br />Finally, a brief, yet totally unnecessary, scene of two homosexuals walking their dog is a part of this so-called \\"family film\\". <br /> <br />I am extremely disappointed in this remake.  It really could have been done in a much better way.
0609610570|4.0|Execution has been undervalued in recent years as oposed to strategy, which is usually seen as the most important part of doing business. But the truth is that you can have the best ideas but if you don't know how to implement them, you're in a big trouble. <br />This is what the authors try to explain in this easy to read book. It's full of examples (not all of them insightful) and real life experiences on how to link strategy and execution effectively in order to grow your business. <br />
B00005JOMY|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. has not been as quick-witted and riotously funny since he played in Chaplin. He and Val Kilmer turn out to be a comedy team as good as those in Mel Brooks' early movies. There are scenes that cause uproarious laughter in the theater. Like when Downey sticks his severed finger into the ice bucket and the dog eats it. Or when Kilmer's cell phone plays \\"I will survive\\" when it rings. Michelle Monaghan plays Downey's old childhood friend, Harmony. They meet again in L.A. and team up with Kilmer to solve a murder. The trio charm the audience and keeps the laughter at a high volume. And finally, Downey's asides to the audience in his role as Narator are hilarious. From stopping the film to explain something, to changing the typical noir ending by bringing back all the dead characters plus Elvis and Abe Lincoln. It was two hours of razor-sharp dialogue and brilliant comedy. Don't miss this one.

B00005JO1S|4.0|Yes, it does have the same basic premise as Jumanji (both books were written by the same guy, after all!)-- board game wreaks havoc on innocent children who happen to have a few problems other than an insane board game. But Zathura is about 100 times better. First of all, the characters aren't overshadowed by 1) huge special effects and 2)big name actors who take over the movie. This is a movie with heart, and a great way to start the holiday season, I might add. Remember how surprisingly good the fun, holiday movie Elf was? This is like that, and both are directed by Jon Favreau. This film does a marvelous job of making an implausible situation seem plausible, while giving the characters some realness. <br /> <br />Two young boys, Walter (age 10) and Danny (age 6) are constantly fighting. Danny just wants someone to play with. Walter could care less. Their father (played by Tim Robbins) is newly divorced, which only adds to this family's stress. There's also an older sister, Lisa, who sleeps until 2 pm and doesn't care about anyone but herself. When Danny finds a mysterious game in the basement called Zathura, he begs Walter to play. Walter doesn't feel like it, so Danny begins to play anyway. On his first spin, the game spits out a card that reads, \\"Meteor Shower. Take evasive action.\\" Danny can't really read, and it's not until their living room is being pelleted with meteors that the boys take evasive action. Danny runs in circles screaming. Eventually, when the house if floating in the middle of space, they rescue a stranded astronaut (played wonderfully by Dax Shephard!), who reveals that he also once played the game and that's why he's a stranded astronaut. There's actually a twist in this movie about the astronaut, which I totally didn't see coming. I had to explain it to my little cousins because they didn't really get it, but they still thought it was cool.  <br /> <br />In the words of a three year old movie critic prodigy, this movie is \\"really really cool, kinda scary, but really cool.\\" She even said it was better than Jumanji! And if you can't take my word for it, take hers. This is a very sweet movie that explores not only the far reaches of space, but the relationship that siblings have with one another. Very good and PERFECT for kids (except a couple swear words, nothing to really worry about though), I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie!!
B000BGR0OM|5.0|It has been six long years since Eurythmics released their 1999 tenth studio recorded album entitled, PEACE. The year is now 2005 and Eurythmics have released their eleventh album entitled, THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION. This album marks the second greatest hits compilation for Eurythmics, only this time they featured more of their hits that were overlooked on their 1991 GREATEST HITS album. This album features nothing, but Eurythmics' ULTIMATE collection.    I'VE GOT A LIFE    New song. The first single from the album. Before I heard this song, I thought that Eurythmics had really done it all in releasing new material and would probably never release any new material that would sound as great as their previous material, but I found that I was wrong when I listened to this song, because this song is outstanding. Great song.    LOVE IS A STRANGER    From the album SWEET DREAMS (ARE MADE OF THIS) (1983). This is a great song, and I think it was a minor hit, good enough to be included on compilations, such as this, but probably not the single that made Eurythmics famous.    SWEET DREAMS (ARE MADE OF THIS)    From the album SWEET DREAMS (ARE MADE OF THIS) (1983). I think this was the song that made Eurythmics really popular. This was a song that will forever remain a classic. In 1995, Gothic-Rocker, Marilyn Manson went on to re-record this song as a cover. Although, he kept the same sound of this song, he made the style and tone of the song his own. The song was included on his 1995 album, SMELLS LIKE CHILDREN, and it was later included in the 1999 remake, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.    WHO'S THAT GIRL?    From the album TOUCH (1983). This is one hell of a great song, where in the video, David and Annie decide to use this song's concept. Madonna did not make a cover of this song. Her song, of the same name, was recorded in 1987 for her film of the same name. So, Eurythmics and Madonna have two completely different songs with the same title.    RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE    From the album TOUCH (1983). I am not too sure if this song was a hit or not. My guess is that if it wasn't, then Annie and David must have decided that this should be included here. Great song.    HERE COMES THE RAIN AGAIN    From the album TOUCH (1983). A great song with a great vocal by Annie, especially in the choruses.    WOULD I LIE TO YOU?    From the album BE YOURSELF TONIGHT (1985). When I first heard this song, I was not paying too much attention, which led me to believe that I was not crazy about it. But I decided to hear this song again and I was completely blown away. This is just awesome, featuring the sounds of Rock and R&B.    THERE MUST BE AN ANGEL (PLAYING WITH MY HEART)    From the album BE YOURSELF TONIGHT (1985). This is another classic.    SISTERS ARE DOIN' IT FOR THEMSELVES (Duet with Aretha Franklin)    From the album BE YOURSELF TONIGHT (1985). I still do not find Aretha Franklin to be talented, except for her songs, \\"Respect\\" and \\"Chain Of Fools\\". I find Aretha to be at her best when she records a duet, like this one. This song just flat out rocks.    IT'S ALRIGHT (BABY'S COMING BACK)    From the album BE YOURSELF TONIGHT (1985). The last hit from their 1985 album, BE YOURSELF TONIGHT, but it wouldn't be their last single from that album, for the song, \\"I Love You Like A Ball And Chain\\" was the last single from their 1985 album, but the single wasn't a huge hit. This song was a big hit, complete with a great music video.    WHEN TOMORROW COMES    From the album REVENGE (1986). Great song.    THORN IN MY SIDE    From the album REVENGE (1986). \\"You gave me such a bad time, tried to hurt me, but now I know...\\", says Annie before the first verse of this synthesized acoustic guitar recorded classic.    THE MIRACLE OF LOVE    From the album REVENGE (1986). Not bad.    MISSIONARY MAN    From the album REVENGE (1986). Awesome tune, with one hell of a freaky-a** video. Oh, by the way, \\"...Don't mess with a missionary man. A missionary man...\\"    YOU HAVE PLACED A CHILL IN MY HEART    From the album SAVAGE (1987). I'm glad that another song from their 1987 album was not overlooked. Great song.    I NEED A MAN    From the album SAVAGE (1987). Great.    I SAVED THE WORLD TODAY    From the album PEACE (1999). Great.    17 AGAIN    From the album PEACE (1999). Great.    WAS IT JUST A LOVE AFFAIR?    New song. I am not sure as if they will release this song as their second & final single from this album, but we'll have to wait and see. Great song.        I am disappointed in knowing that for this compilation, Eurythmics decided to overlook the following hits: \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"The King & Queen Of America\\", \\"(My My) Baby's Gonna Cry\\", & \\"Revival\\", but this album proves to be Eurythmics' ULTIMATE COLLECTION. An album worth buying.
B00008DDHY|5.0|Set up like a documentary, Bloody Sunday, brings to the screen the true story of the 1972 massacre in Derry, Northern Ireland, by the British forces and the cover-up that followed. <br />James Nesbitt, Tim Pigott-Smith, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!   <br />Very well written and very well presented, the movie does a great job of describing the complexity of Northern Ireland.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Bloody Sunday is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I am not so much into listening to some band simply because they fit into a specific genre - I am 29 and simply too old to give a crap about that kind of thing.  But if you dig music politics, than so be it.  My review is from a guy who likes rock/metal and good music in general. <br /> <br />With that said, here goes nothing. <br /> <br />I am going to admit that I ran across A7x from seeing the Burn it Down video on MTV (I know, I know)  But I liked what I heard and picked up City of Evil, which is really dig.  But I wanted more, so I got Waking the Fallen.  I knew going in that WTF was a different album in certain respects, esp the vocals.  But holy crap, is it a great metal album.   <br /> <br />As others said, it is a very cohesive album and really flows well from one song to the next.  The dark content of the band's songs is simply awesome.  Their songs are layered in a clean manner with the lead and rythym guitarists not stepping on each others' toes.  I think the drumming is more intriguing on City of Evil, but it's still very solid on WTF.  Personally, I think the other band members stepped their games up on City of Evil to compensate for Shadows' vocal woes, or maybe these guys are just true musicians that don't mind expanding their horizons.  But I digress. <br /> <br />Each song on WTF has its own distinct personality, while still maintaining a consistent theme throughout the entire album. In general, I don't like 100% screaming vocals, which makes no sense if I am a true metal fan..or perhaps I am still \\"growing\\" as a fan.  But even if WTF had no actual singing on it, I would still give it 4 stars and enjoy it all the same.  But the fact that these guys add rhthym to their sound in both the vocals and music just balances it all out to create a great metal album. <br /> <br />Personally, I like Second Heartbeat the most of all the songs.  Perhaps it's because it has many elements present.  But I can pick any one song and listen to it straight without anyproblems. <br /> <br />Probably most important is how A7x don't get political on you - they are talking about dark, morbid topics that are what true metal should be all about.  When I am driving home, I don't care about some political mumbo jumbo.  I want to hear about mothers crying and children screaming and...you get the idea.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential, brings to the screen the story of a California police precinct in the 1950's.  The movie does a really good job of shedding light on American society during that period. <br />Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny De Vito, Kim Basinger, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  <br />The plot, the setting, and the dialogues, are all WONDERFUL! <br />Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />In conclusion, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  <br />
B00006SFBD|5.0|For those of you who are new to Opeth, this band is truley in a league of its own. Their music remians true to progressive death metal, however it drifts to emotional corners of the human mind that I, frankly, have never experieneced before. Both clean singing and chaotic growling vocals create an aura like no other. At times, voraciously heavy, and others, melodic, ambient, and beautiful, Opeth deliver such diverse, jaw dropping arrangements that it would be justafiable to label them amonsgt great composers such as Shostakovich, Stravinski, or Mahler.     Beyond the point, _Deliverance_ is part of a two piece work, being before the beautiful, soft, non-metal record _Damnation_. It is meant to be the \\"heavy\\" side of Opeth, however, it is a crime to label a side of Opeth with one word. _Deliverance_ could be labeled as technical, experimental, chaotic, discombobulated, direct and intense. From the opening track \\"Wreath\\", considered to be one of the, if not the, heaviest Opeth tracks, to the closing track \\"By The Pain I See In Others\\", to the title track \\"Deliverance\\", this record delivers hard-hitting, emotional pieces, with a slight less emphasis on the dark, poetic aspect of Opeth. With records like _Blackwater Park_ and _Still Life_, such a mood was set that, when listening, you go beyond the music, and into another demension. _Deliverance_ slightly missed this queue, though I'm sure Akerfeldt and co. intended that. This album is more about the music, from the technical, lightning riffs, to the complex, intricate drumming, _Deliverance_ does kick some serious arse from start to finish. With the exception of the balad-ish, soft, ambient track \\"A Fair Judgement\\" and the short instrumental \\"For Absent Friends\\", Akerfeldt creates some intense growling/screaming that could be seen as his finest voal moments. All in all, This record takes you on a musical journey which manages to keep your attention from start to finish; a rare thing for Opeth albums. It took me severallistens to get into Records like _Morningrise_ _Orchid_ and _Still Life_.    Although my least favorite of Opeth's, _Deliverance_ is a must-own for any fans. If you're new to Opeth, though, start with _Blackwater Park_ or _Ghost Reveries_    LONG MAY OPETH CONTINUE!
B000BTJDG2|4.0|Maybe anything can be so strong like the exorcist was, but this movie it's very well, scary and interesting.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I've been a DM fan since 1984. They are one of the greatest bands ever. I heard Precious and hoped maybe this was a return to true DM form, only to find that it wasn't. The album is basically one good song (Precious) surrounded by filler and b-sides (if they even rate that). I'm only giving 3 stars because I'm glad they are still making music and touring,  and Precious alone deserves a 3 star. I've listened to the cd over and over in hopes that it would grow on me, but it's just not working.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|The moment it became known that director Tim Burton was<br />going to make a feature film adapting author Roald Dahl's<br />CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, one could anticipate<br />two things. One, that Burton would present a unique<br />cinematic experience. With a maverick crew including<br />screenwriter John August and composer/longtime creative<br />partner Danny Elfman, and a phenomenal cast featuring<br />Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee, David Kelly as<br />Grandpa Joe, Freddy Highmore superbly portraying central<br />character Charlie Bucket and the incredible Johnny Depp<br />bringing a whole-new \\"wonkiness\\" to Willie Wonka, Burton<br />unleashes all the satiric genius and narrative heart which<br />characterizes his moviemaking artistry.<br /><br />The second point is that Burton's film would inevitably<br />attract a crowd of naysayers who feel that no one should<br />touch \\"their\\" memories of the Gene Wilder film made some<br />30 years before, WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.<br />Wilder himself, a gifted master of stage and screen, is<br />reported to have gone on record as denouncing the Burton<br />film as a remake of his film; attesting that Burton and<br />his associates made their film only to make money.<br /><br />Such comparisons are unfair and unfortunate, since they<br />are totally off the mark. Burton's film is no remake of<br />the Wilder vehicle, which was primarily a showpiece for<br />the music of Broadway composers Leslie Bricusse and Anthony<br />Newley. The fact is that the Wilder film paid little to no<br />attention to the ingeniously subversive whimsy of the Dahl<br />original. Tight and catchy though it may be, Wilder's film<br />bears little of the ethical impact that continues to make<br />Dahl's work a hallmark of Children's stories for all ages.<br /><br />Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY takes Dahl's<br />monumental book into full account at all levels. Elfman's<br />adapting of Dahl's original lyrics into the outrageously-<br />telling Oompa-Loompa song & dance numbers is a clear signal<br />that this film is an inspired improvisation upon an untapped<br />original source, playing second fiddle to no one. Only a<br />diversified musicmaker such as Elfman could have pulled<br />off the genre-crossing orchestrations which enrich this<br />film. For a composer whose roots stretch from the avant<br />groove of Oingo Boingo to the wry symphonic portraits<br />which embody many a film of the past 15 to 20 years,<br />CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY represents a signature<br />moment in this amazing career.<br /><br />Depp continues to amaze audiences with his daring ability<br />to portray the human condition at any level, always with<br />compelling conviction and a healthy dose of self-depreciating<br />wit. Depp's Wonka is a study of precocious vulnerability<br />and dogged drive. We find out that much of Wonka's creative<br />impulses and inner needs stem from his own missing childhood,<br />setting up the soul of this film and a particularly moving<br />climax. Christopher Lee, whose current resurgence as a<br />master thespian was sparked by his brief-but-pivotal role<br />in Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW, is no less pivotal here, and a<br />joy to experience. Joyous, too, is the highly-energized,<br />gleefully-diversified of Deep Roy as ALL the Oompa-Loompas!<br />Give this man whatever he wants!<br />A special kudos must go to narrator Geoffrey Holder, the<br />multi-talented artist whose cacao-rich voice alone made<br />\\"Marvelous\\" a source of Third World pride and audacity<br />in the 1960s. The twinkle in his tone STILL tells volumes...<br /><br />Top honors for acting, however, has to go to Freddy Highmore,<br />whose first experience with Depp in FINDING NEVERLAND was an<br />unforgettable triumph. Even more telling in the Burton film,<br />Highmore's youthful naivete is tinged with an incredible<br />emotional range and knowing depth which is the centerof<br />this film. If Burton's film is vital in restoring the<br />integrity of Dahl's original work, Highmore's performance<br />singularly restores Charlie Bucket as the story's central<br />character; rescuing him from the hapless sidekick role that<br />the Wilder film placed the character into. Highmore, in<br />turn, provides Depp's Wonka with the platform for<br />a magnificent, powerful performance.<br /><br />The two-disc Warner Bros. Deluxe Edition is the best<br />way to fully appreciate all the works that Burton,<br />cast, and crew lovingly put into this film. A prime<br />case for why DVDs are so special, this edition delves<br />into all aspects of this production, and includes a<br />fine vignette on author Dahl himself (whose family<br />worked hand-in-hand with Burton here).<br /><br />Everything about this film is wondrous. From its macabre<br />opening amidst the mechanizations of assembly-line procedure,<br />to the first look at the Buckets' crooked home of hard-fought<br />harmony amidst the cookie-cutter sameness of urbanized<br />regimentation, you've walked into the off-minor world of<br />the surreal and the substantial which is uniquely Tim<br />Burton's.<br />Equally vital, this film aptly reflects upon the wild n<br />wooly, warmingly wise world of Roald Dahl.

B00003CXPD|5.0|This is my abosolute favorite movie. Billy Elliot captures everything a good artsy movie should, you laugh, you cry, and you get so involved with all of the characters. Jamie Bell devilers an amazing performance as this movie's lead role, Billy Elliot. The music, emotion, and artistic filming make this movie a complete hit.
0553801503|3.0|It would seem that GRRM is a victim of his own comercial success as his editor seems unwilling to sit down this money maker and tell him he needs to not just cut sentences or trim paragraphs but that he needs to kill entire chapters. Don't get me wrong, GRRM's newest book is a fair read and fans of his would do well to check it out of the library or wait for the paperback, just don't expect a book of the same quality as the first three. The fact that 80% of this book does nothing to advance the plot and most of the plot advancement htat does happen is totaly predictable makes it hard to believe that GRRM had so much material that he was forced to cut his book in half and move the other half the to the next book in the series: A Dance with Dragons. <br /> <br />It was an average book that came out after far too long of a wait and was all together disapointing. Still, if you've read the first three you whould read thins one as well. If you haven't read the first thee then you should probably be reading reviews for the first book :) <br /> <br />Don't put too much trust in the 5-Star fanboys, as in every fanboy's eyes their object of obsession can do no wrong and there will always be tired excuses for the missteps of their idols. Martin's writes great fatasy but don't be fooled: this was a letdown.
B000AP04L0|5.0|\\"Office Space\\" isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it's certainly one of my favorites. Like zillions of other people, I was introduced to this movie while trapped in a miserable soul-sucking job in a dysfunctional office environment. The kind of job where I'd spend Sundays curled up on the couch in a fetal position dreading Monday ... the kind of job where I'd dread Friday nights because I knew they weren't going to last long. <br /> <br />I wore out my VHS copy of this film years ago, so the DVD special edition got snapped up in a hurry. Some of the deleted scenes are hilarious, although the best new footage -- John C. McGinley's extended riffs on the wonder that is Michael Bolton -- is only to be found in the Mike Judge-hosted retrospective making-of feature.  <br /> <br />In your darkest moments, \\"Office Space\\" is that shining jewel that makes life bearable again. It is indeed chicken soup for the cubicled soul. It's all \\"about\\" the workplace in America in the 1990s -- the cubicle-bound middle-management culture is so brilliantly dissected. From the traffic jam in the opening scene to the soulless birthday party held for the \\"division VP\\" towards the end, to the blinding white rage of the gangsta rap soundtrack, it is so funny that you will hurt.  <br /> <br />The cast is outstanding, of course. It was shocking to find out that long-time \\"Cheers\\" barstool occupant Paul Willson was cast at the last minute; he's exactly the kind of actor you'd expect to find on the fringes of a movie like this one, so you wonder why it took so long to find him. Everyone has their personal favorites among the supporting players (McGinley & Willson, Ajay Naidu and Gary Cole all rob blind every scene they're in) but David Herman, playing \\"Michael Bolton\\", is my personal favorite. Maybe it's the short-sleeve-shirt with tie ensemble, or the printer scene, or, at long last, \\"Call me Mike\\", but there are times when I've watched \\"Office Space\\" just to identify with him and his plight.<br /> <br />In the end, \\"Office Space\\" went from just funny to truly life-changing the moment Peter Gibbsons said that he dreamed of doing \\"nothing\\". That's it! That's the moment! That's what we all really want, deep down, after years of crushing middle-management rules, memos, and coffee cups held chest-high. Yeah. Great. Why don't you just go ahead and do that?

B000002NAK|5.0|I hate to say good things about an album that Madonna might make some money from, because I think she is a filthy slut who has used any gimmick she can to make money regardless of the morals.  That being said, I think her singing in this movie is a cut above her popular albums and is highly entertaining.  I saw the movie and enjoyed the music so much that I had to have the album; it's a 2-cd album and I paid more for it than most any other album I have purchased in a long time.  Keep in mind there are a lot of songs on the album that don't have Madonna singing.  The singers may not be the best, but the music is so entertaining that it makes no difference.  The movie had so much dialog mixed with the music that this album could have been a disaster, but they did an excellent job of getting the flavor of the movie and using appropriate amounts of dialog with music.  I think this is one of the best movie soundtracks ever done.  Great editing job and all the songs from the movie seem to be here.  If any were missing, I didn't notice.  Not disappointing in any way.  Worth hearing over and over again. <br />

B000063UR1|5.0|Am a bit surprised at how many negative reviews there are for this movie.  No, it isn't Star Wars and it's not a big action thriller.  Rather it's a movie with a message--that we need to protect at all costs the things that are really important (the last existing forests in the world in this case).  Other than another little known Bruce Dern movie (Smile), I think this is  his best performance.  Frankly I cringe when I see or hear Bruce Dern, so I think it says a lot for his ability as an actor to pull this off successfully.  I really don't like him, but this is still a favorite movie of mine.  You can't hate the character he plays in this movie because he is doing something terribly important (saving the last forests), but you don't like him either because he is fanatic and ends up killing to save the forests.  I thought the music was great in this movie; very beautiful and haunting.  Some didn't like it because of Joan Baez.  I never liked her politics, but her voice is one of the most beautiful voices of that era.  If I was stranded on a desert island with only one movie to watch, I sincerely hope that it would be this one.  It is not that entertaining to younger folks raised on the computer-generated special effects found in the better science fiction movies.  It will never measure up to something like the Matrix or any of the Star Wars movies, but it is still a hauntingly beautiful movie with special effects that are good enough to keep you interested.  As most other reviewers have said the robots are charming.  Don't listen to the bad reviews; decide for yourself.  Even if you don't like the movie overall, you'll find something enjoyable here.  The somewhat surprise ending is very sad, so if you want an upbeat movie, this is not the one for you, but it couldn't end any other way, really.  This one gives me a tear in the eye and lump in the throat at the end every time I see it.  A little campy and silly, but overall a real gem of a movie.  Probably had more impact and was more impressive at the time it first came out, than now.
6305428522|5.0|This 1994 movie, which was produced and directed by Robert Redford tells the story of the 50's Quiz Scandal.  With Ray Fiennes as Charles Van Duren and John Turturro as Herbert Stempel lead an excellent all-star cast in this is a great film, which is wonderfully acted and it is must-have.  Especially if you are a TV Game Show fan like myself.
0618164413|5.0|As an author, I am into classic books for children.  I believe this book will always be something any child would love to read.  I remember adoring that cute litte monkey and the man in the yellow hat.  Adventurous and curious was George.  Who knew that we would still adore him after all this time?!
B00097DXZS|5.0|Sony just agreed to stop installing malware on these CD's.  Read below for more information.   <br /> <br />Regarding the music though, this album is great!  Frustrated with the iTunes playback problem?  Do what I did - buy it from the iTunes music store!  It's only $9.99 there and it synched up with my iPod right away.  (You get a couple of bonus tracks and a digital booklet too!) <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />CNET News <br />FAQ: Sony's 'rootkit' CDs <br /> <br /> <br />By John Borland <br />[...]  <br /> <br />Story last modified Fri Nov 11 11:55:00 PST 2005  <br /> <br />On Thursday, a wave of malicious software appeared in the wild that piggybacked on copy-protection technology installed on hard drives by Sony BMG Music Entertainment CDs. <br />Computer security companies had been predicting such exploit code in the wild for weeks, since an independent developer had exposed the presence of a \\"rootkit\\" tool on the Sony CDs. The rootkit technology hid the copy protection from view, but also left open a hole that could hide other software. <br /> <br />Virus writers quickly took advantage of that hole, modifying an old Trojan horse to take advantage of the powerful inadvertent shielding provided by the Sony software. <br /> <br />On Friday, Sony responded to the furor and announced that it will suspend production of CDs that contain this particular copy-protection technology and take a second look at its digital rights management strategy. <br /> <br />Antivirus companies are now offering a range of advice, and confusion remains about exactly what the software does and how dangerous it can be to a PC. Here are the basics that everyone should know about this potentially dangerous issue: <br /> <br />What is on the Sony CDs?  <br />The CDs involved are loaded with a relatively new kind of content protection created by British company First 4 Internet. When a listener puts the album into a computer's CD drive, it pops up a license agreement. If the listener accepts, itinstalls the copy protection rootkit onto the hard drive. <br /> <br />The rootkit element of the software is used to hide virtually all traces of the copy protection software's presence on a PC, so that an ordinary computer user would have no way to find it. The software acts to limit the number of copies that can be made of the CD and prevents a computer user from making unprotected MP3s from the music. <br /> <br />What is a rootkit? Isn't that something that virus writers use?  <br />A rootkit is a powerful piece of software that takes over control of a computer at the most fundamental level. In computer terms, it establishes \\"root\\" access, which is similar to administrative access, instead of access for just an ordinary user. It can potentially prevent a computer user from detecting its presence or from performing certain tasks on their own PC. <br /> <br />Like most computing tools, this is not intrinsically a bad thing, but can be abused. Virus writers use these tools to help take over computers and hide the presence of their work. <br /> <br />Is Sony's software a virus or a Trojan horse?  <br />Some aggrieved users may see little difference. Computer security companies do make a distinction between Sony's software and a virus, noting that this was distributed by a legitimate company with a legitimate business interest (even if many people disagree with that business interest). <br /> <br />However, they are deeply critical of Sony's techniques and say that the amount of information given to users about what the software would do to a computer was wholly inadequate, and the lack of an uninstall tool was bad policy. <br /> <br />Computer Associates has labeled the software \\"spyware,\\" because it also sends back some information about what CDs are being played. <br /> <br />Can I uninstall it?  <br />Even if you could find the hidden copy protection components yourself, computer experts warn against trying to uninstall it without help. Trying to do remove it without official instructions could damage the computer, rendering the CD drive inoperable. <br /> <br />Sony's Web site has a downloadable patch which will remove the ability of the copy protection software to hide from view, but will not uninstall it. <br /> <br />To uninstall the software completely, a user must fill out a separate customer service form on Sony's Web site, asking for instructions on how to uninstall the rootkit software. <br /> <br />How do the new Trojan horses piggyback on Sony's software? <br />The Sony software hides itself very well on a computer, but allows other software to use the same technique. Essentially it establishes a new rule at the level of the operating system that says any software that starts with the string of characters \\"$sys$\\" should be hidden from view. <br /> <br />Virus writers quickly took pre-existing malicious software and put those characters at the beginning of the relevant code, making their work invisible on any computer that had the Sony copy protection installed. <br /> <br />What do the new viruses do?  <br />So far, the ones that have emerged hide themselves, then open a channel to the IRC chat network. An attacker could use that back door to control the computer completely, using it to send out spam, launch attacks on other computers, or many other nefarious tasks. <br /> <br />Will antivirus software stop this?  <br />The problem with rootkits is that they can hide themselves even from antivirus software. However, most of the big antivirus companies are working with First 4 Internet and Sony to break through the rootkit's invisibility and identify anything hidden by the Sony software. That means most antivirus protection will be able to identify and remove the Trojans. <br /> <br />As always, it's important to keep antivirus software updated, or it won't be able to find these new problems. <br /> <br /> <br />Do all copy-protected CDs have this problem?  <br />No, the majority does not. Most of Sony's copy-protected CDs use a different technology from a company called Sunncomm, which does not present the rootkit security issues. In other countries, many copy-protected CDs use technology from Macrovision, which also uses a different technique. <br /> <br />Which CDs are dangerous, then?  <br />The Electronic Frontier Foundation is keeping a list of CDs that seem to have the First 4 Internet software included. <br /> <br />If you're buying a CD, look on the back for a little box labeled \\"Compatible with.\\" If that includes the Web address \\"cp.sonybmg.com/xcp\\", then it probably has the rootkit software included. <br /> <br />Is what Sony did legal?  <br />Copy-protection software by itself is perfectly legal. However, at least one class-action lawsuit has already been filed against Sony in California, asserting that it violated state and federal statutes against computer tampering, trespass, fraud and false advertising. Several other lawsuits are expected. Italian consumer groups have also called for criminal investigation and potential legal action, although the discs were primarily distributed in the United States. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Copyright ©1995-2005 CNET Networks, Inc.

0140067477|5.0|I respectfully disagree with Penny - this is the greatest explanation of the unexplainable that I have ever seen. Get it if you're a Taoist, interested in Tao, or just going through a rough patch. With humor and taste the author brings a basic understanding of the belief system and brightens the darkest day. Wonderful read!
B00005JNQA|1.0|It takes itself a bit too seriously.  The casting is far stretched also.  A silly piece of work. <br /> <br />Halle Berry would have been perfect in the role of Sylvia, but Nicole Kidman?  She is supposedly African, with an African lover, and in all the photographs within the movie and among all the other people shown as her countrymen in the USA, she is the only one who is not black. <br /> <br />There is no credibility on any count, whether the casting or the very, very weak story.   Neither are the views of Manhattan, particularly in the last scene where it looks like a pastel backdrop rather than a view of the east side of the island.  A waste of time, except for watching Nicole Kidman, one of the most beautiful people on the screen today.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|i first heard Mr Stevens' CD in a coffee house and knew this was music worth a closer listen.  The soulfulness and simplicity of his singing voice and presentation remind me a bit of Rufus Wainwright but what I find the most striking is the range of musical styles and sheer inventiveness of the arrangements.  These are many playful songs on this album, others meditative, some downright sad, but all are worth your time to put other things aside and listen with attention.
0792110188|3.0|Who'd of thought that a Howard Hawks western starring John Wayne and Robert Mitchum could be so mediocre?  Wayne who went on to snare a deserved Oscar for \\"True Grit\\", looked ancient and ill suited to portray one of the fastest draws in the west, gunfighter Cole Thornton.  He seemed even more unbelieveable in winning the affections of attractive widow Maudie played by Charlene Holt.<br /><br />Wayne joins forces with alcoholic El Dorado sheriff J.P. Harrah, not much of a stretch for Robert Mitchum who seemed half asleep at times in the film.  Wayne had been recruited by land baron Bart Jason played by a snotty Ed Asner to evict the rightful owner of a tract of land that he desired, which Wayne ultimately declined to do.  Together they fight off an Asner sponsored gang led by facially scarred actor Christopher George.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"El Dorado\\"'s tired theme had been done before and in much better fashion in films such as \\"Shane\\" for example.  The aged pair of Wayne and Mitchum didn't do it for me.  James Caan in one of his first major roles was not well cast in this movie.  Arthur Hunnicutt playing deputy Bull Harris was the acting highlight of the film.  Charlene Holt parading around in negligee was pretty good as well.
0064430227|5.0|I remember this book as a child and as a mother I read this book to my children.  It is a beloved book in our library and it is awesome to still see this wonderful book about a little boy with his magic purple crayon and his incredible imagination in print.  You are talking about a book that has been in print for half a century.  Truly awesome!!!!
B00009AOBI|5.0|I've lost count of how many times I've watched this movie over the years. After watching the \\"Director's Cut\\" a few nights ago, I realized that it gets better each time. I wouldn't say this new version is better than the original; I did like the extra footage, but I much prefer the Bob Seger soundtrack. After watching the new version with the Springsteen soundtrack, I put on the original version and skipped to the end credits. Hearing Seger's \\"Roll Me Away\\" while the credits roll is almost a spiritual experience. To quote Roger Ebert: \\"'Mask' is a wonderful movie, a story of high spirits and hope and courage.\\" <br />If you don't own this wonderful movie, I encourage you to buy a used copy of the original version as soon as possible!
0553801503|2.0|I'm biased because I think that this author is an artistic genius.  Anyone who has read his prior works can easily see that.  I'm also a big fan of the two short stories featuring the Hedge Knight.  That being said, this work is not like the prior Fire and Ice novels.  Bottom line weaknesses:  no plot movement, too much description, and way too many name and lineage intros to keep track of. There are many parallels between the way this series has turned with this book and the way Jordan eventually went with his series.  I can only hope that this is not a trend although we'll probably see more of the same with Dance with Dragons.  I've also got to say that, although it is very profitable for the author, to split this book into to two and utilizing half the characters makes things very awkward and unenjoyable.   I loved the prior series and could not put those books down.  I'm reading this one only because I'm a big fan.  Had the first one been written this way, I would have never continued on with the series.  I agree with a previous reviewer that there should have been some major editing.   I still think he's a gifted genius, but simply don't have time to waste reading long 700+ page books that don't satisfy.  This author is going to lose me (like Jordan did after book 6) if he keeps this up.
B000ASSDVA|5.0|I gave the dvd five stars because the quality is the best that can be expected from a masterful performance on film made in the early sixties. Not to mention great acting and the film's historical lesson. Miklos Rozsa's score is classic. This one is a keeper and it's about time.
B0006399FS|5.0|As a hardcore U2 fan since Joshua Tree, I can honestly say that I have never seen a band have a more divided fan base than U2. It seems there are at least 5 camps of U2 fans, and many more subdivisions.  1)\\"Nothing they've done will equal War. They stopped being a hard-rock/punk band and went soft.\\" 2)\\"Joshua Tree is the greatest U2 album ever, no matter what.\\" 3) \\"See # 2 for Achtung Baby.\\" 4)\\"After AB, Zooropa, and POP, this band lost their edge and went corporate with ATYCLB and HTDAAB.\\" 5)\\"ATYCLB and HTDAAB represent the new mature U2. I love it.\\"<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />Why can't we have it all? Why can't a band distill everything it has learned over a quarter century of music into 3 minutes of a massive headrush called \\"Vertigo\\"? This is a great album by polished, seasoned musicians.  Period.  You can waste time debating where it belongs in the U2 pantheon, but it's still a great collection of songs.  The Edge has never sounded better.  Bono is on point.  Adam and Larry keep proving they are the best rhythm section out there.  I'll just keep playing this album , right alongside all the other ones mentioned above.  Long Live U2!<br /><br />Update:  5 Grammys.  If you are wondering what all the fuss is about, get it and learn.  Maybe U2's most emotional album ever.<br /><br />Update 2: \\"Original of the Species\\" may be the best song U2 has ever done.
B000002LND|3.0|When this was released way back in 1990, people were thrilled to see a greatest hits type collection from Madonna.  It included the majority of her singles, and left off a few too because the room was needed for two new tracks at the time (Justify my Love, Rescue Me).  The first thing I noticed when listening to the album was the 'echoey' type of sound and the awful remixes.  I read the linear notes to find out that they used a new sound processing system called Q-sound to present a type of surround sound feeling. This techonology was very new then and expected to take off in a big way - but it didn't.  The Q-sound really spoils this album.    The remixes also spoil the album. Many songs have been edited to shorter versions. Beginning with \\"Holiday\\" - any fan will notice the difference between this sped up remix to the original.  Other bad remixes include \\"Borderline\\", \\"Papa don't Preach\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", and \\"Express Yourself\\". AS other reviewers have pointed out, the remix of \\"Like a Prayer\\" is shocking too.    What was wrong with the original versions?  Absolutely nothing,. Why Madonna couldnt include them on this album instead of letting her friends remix them badly is beyond alot of fans.    May we wait for the day when a definitive greatest hits is released containing the original recordings.  Artists, take note >>> fans do not like remixes or re-recordings on compilations.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|The movie is about this midget who likes to yell alot. He eventually marries a crank whore, and then since he's such a douche, he pisses this terminator wannabe off, and that guy blows him away.
B0000025ZF|4.0|This is a fantastic album that suffers from flat sound on the CD version.  When the CD format took off in the late 80s, record companies scrambled to release their major back catalogs as quickly as possible.  In their haste they often simply took the master mix for the LP or cassette version of an album and released it on CD.  The problem with this is that CDs reproduce sound differently from vinyl or tape, and therefore the unremastered recordings tend to sound weak on CD.  It is clear that when this CD was released in 1990, it was not remastered, and fifteen years later this has still not been corrected, which is a shame.  Even the label knows they've released a cheap version of this album, since it sells for under ten bucks as a \\"Super Saver.\\"  Buy it used if you can, and wait for the label to give this album the proper release it deserves.
B000001TVD|5.0|i want this album veryBUYIT much i dont even have it and  im writingBUYIT a review, basically onceBUYIT you hear super stupid,hit it and quit it, the title trackBUYIT and wars of armagaideion youll want it too so just do yourself a favour and Buy it
B0007MUR2W|5.0|Top 70,s CLASSIC album of All-TIME. <br />perfect timing, beat, vocals, instruments, ffffffreak out in a moonage daydream ooohhhhhh yyyyyeeeeaaaaa ----rock musics favorite era was topped by this HEAVY metal opera. Defined the times, god bless mr. bowie....
B00006JJ51|5.0|Whoever it was that posted the review saying \\"NWA is not hardcore..\\" OPEN YOUR EARS MAN!! Compared to modern rap like \\"fiddy\\" NWA is by far \\"hardcore.\\" NWA isn't about complaining.. Did you even listen to the record? It's all about killing and stealing, making a living in compton. Fiddy is all about \\"I got so much money and honeys and life is good.\\" NWA is all about \\"When I'm called off, I gotta sawd off, Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off.\\" <br /> <br />As NWA got more \\"hardcore,\\" their ever growing band of followers become more and more exclusively middle class, white, suburban boys. I usually hate rap, but this is one CD worth buying. Disregard the stereotpying, nihilistic, Robert guy. He obviously got distracted by eazy e's voice, if he even listend to the record.
B0007P3582|1.0|I've tried to listen, I swear! At first I thought maybe I wasn't being open minded, but I came to realise that it wasn't me being closed minded, it's that this so-called artist's intelligence level is at a sad low in today's so called music industy. The reviews of the people who like this just proves my point. All of the Gangster slang they use is completely moronic! Seriously people, talking like a jackass makes you look like an idiot. I wish people would get back to real vocabulary.<br /><br />Ok, back to the music. Is it just me, or is there somebody else out there that can only hear the hooks on this album so many times, until they need therapy? I'm convinced that people who like this music form, are either void of all sense of melody and musicianship, or are are trying to fit in with a clique and be accepted by other people that are being fooled in exactly the same way (most likely the latter). Please, if you have any sense of what music is, just listen to this and ask yourself what it is that makes you believe you like it. Do you want drugs? Do you want a gun? Do you want illegitimate children?<br /><br />This album is a sad commentary on the decline of the human condition. He's already stolen enough hard earned money from your parents who work day after day just so they can make you happy and put food on the table. Don't be tricked by it's glamour, or it's popularity.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
0790729407|5.0|An excellent movie even if some important facts e.g. 1918 election which legitimised the Old IRA back then were omitted. <br /> <br />We were a colony in the sense that we had never consented incorporation into the UK. The Irish Parliament that voted the Union through in 1800 was exclusively a Protestant one, the Catholic majority (80%) having been banned from it. Also, the parliament was bribed with money, land and titles to get it to vote for Union. And the Loyalist UVF also brought in arms and ammunition from Germany through the port of Larne, Co.Antrim, including over a million rounds of ammunition and 35,000 rifles. The difference being that the British army left them alone when the guns were being brought in but opened fire when the Irish Volunteers (previous name of the Old IRA) brought in arms - far fewer by the way. And anyway, the UVF was formed before the IRA to resist Home Rule by force, so it wasn't just our side that was setting up armies to resist UK law. Also, you say the Home Rulers were elected and that the IRA \\"seized power\\". In fact, in the 1918 elections (unfortunately not covered in the movie), the Home Rulers went from 73 MPs to 6, and SF took all the lost seats. So there was clearly a democratic mandate to break away from Britain.  <br /> <br />Collins was not a terrorist because the mark of a terrorist is the intentional targeting of innocent civilians, which he did not do. In fact after independence and during the Southern Civil War against the Anti-Treaty IRA, the Irish Government actually established security-forces to protect Southern Protestants, e.g. in Co.Louth. I reject your claim about 140,000 Protestants being driven out. 50,000 of those who left were in the British army or in the families of their soldiers and were relocated to Northern Ireland. After the US became independent, a lot of former Loyalists left for Canada. After colonies become independent, many of those formerly loyal to the old regime tend to leave the country. Thesame happened in the former Soviet states where millions of ethnic-Russians have moved to the Russian Federation, e.g. in Kazakhstan, the Russian population has fallen from over 50% to 30%. So this is not unique to Ireland. Many Protestants did leave Southern Ireland after partition, but in the main this was voluntary and based on a feeling of not being at home in a state where they would be in the minority, and because they were mainly Unionists who wanted to live in the part of Ireland remaining in the UK. If we were to follow your line of reasoning, does this mean that Northern Irish Catholics were well treated by the Belfast Parliament from 1922-72. as the Catholic population there has grown from 31% to 41%? Certainly most historians would strongly disagree, considering the gerrymandering, discrimination in housing, burning down of Catholic areas e.g. Bombay Street in the 1960's, and the continued ethnic-cleansing of Irish Catholics from places like Carrickfergus, Larne and Ahoghill in Co.Antrim. As late as 1993, Catholics were only 7% of the RUC (the police), and the Loyalist terror group the UDA, which has killed hundreds of Catholics, was a legal organisation until 1990. The British security forces in Northern Ireland colluded with Loyalist terror groups to murder Catholics, as shown in the Stevens Report. The Stevens Inquiry was commissioned by the British government but several attempts were made to sabotage the investigation, including arson. <br /> <br />The primary reason for the decline in the Protestant population in the South is a consistent pattern of Protestants marrying Catholics, with the children having tended until recently to have been brought up as Catholics under the Ne Temere Decree of the Catholic Church requiring this. As the Catholic Church's influence has dissipated in recent years following scandals, the Protestant population is growing again. This graph [...] <br />illustrates the decline in the Southern Irish Protestant population, and contrasts with your assertions on 140,000 Protestants leaving the State shortly after independence. As shown, their % of the South's population started at 10% (300,000). 140,000 would constitute a 50% decline to 5%. However, the 5% figure was only reached around 1950. This does not support the theory of mass-expulsions in the years immediately proceeding 1921 and independence, therefore. <br /> <br />Regarding Irish people who fought in WW1, most Catholics doing so did this because the Home Rule leader, John Redmond, argued it would influence Britain to look more favourably on the demand for 32 county Home Rule instead of partitioning Ireland, as well as Redmond's drawing of parallels between Ireland and Belgium - countries that were both trying to attain their freedom (from Germany in Belgium's case). Hence, in both senses, Catholics joining the British army felt they were fighting for the \\"freedom of small nations\\". They were certainly not fighting to preserve the oppressive British empire.
0380002930|4.0|Watership down the story of a group of rabbits who leave their warren because of a prophecy by Fiver in which he realizes that anyone who doesn't leave will be in great danger. After being convinced Hazel (who ends up being a natural leader) leads a group of a rabbits also convinced by Fiver's prophecy away from home in search of a new Warren.<br /><br /> This book was very good. You have to be able to go with talking rabbits etc. to enjoy this book and they are considerably more intelligent than is realistic. So if you can suspend your disbelief on these types of things then you would probably enjoy this book. A long journey/adventure about a group of rabbits is search of a new home and the problems and challenges they encounter along the way and also once they arrive. A good balance of action and violence keep the book interesting all the way through.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The story was well written. The dialogue between the rabbits is actually enjoyable for the most part. You can feel as you read how the group of rabbits who didn't really know each other very well in the beginning come together as a group as the story progresses which makes you care for the characters and pull for them as you read on. The characters were well written and have distinct personalities.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Not much. There were a few too many El-ahrairah and Rabscuttle stories. They are mythological rabbit characters and Hazels group would tell stories about them at points. A few were okay because it gave depth to the rabbit culture but there were a couple too many of them.<br /><br /> Overall Watership down is a good book worth reading. It isn't considered a classic for no reason.
0790732254|5.0|On the roller-coaster that has been Elizabeth Taylor's professional and not-so-private life, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is her artistic peak.  With the character of Martha, Taylor was able to break free from the shackles of her ethereal beauty and persona and scorch onto celluloid, one of the most memorable characters in American Theatre.  First time movie director Mike Nichols coaxed career best performances out of Taylor and husband Richard Burton while staying true to Albee's theatrical grand slam.   The film caused considerable controversy at the time for its foul language and caustic subject matter, helping to abolish the constrictive Hays Code in favour of today's rating system for films.  History aside, Edward Albee's attack on marriage in America, (George and Martha - Washington), still packs a punch today.  The film is told in real time (from 2:00 am until dawn).  As the night wears on, social grace gives way to all out warfare as the characters  slash away at each other until they are forced to face the very core of who they are. Sandy Dennis and George Segal hold their own against the battling Burtons but it's Taylor's triumph.  This classic drama is a must.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone! This was the most boring movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The plot: An outsider meets the new kid at school and decides to help him run for class president.<br /><br />All of my friends at school talked about how funny it was, so since it had such a excellent reputation, I decided to check it out.<br /><br />You wait for something to actually happen, but honestly, nothing ever does. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible. Only watch this movie if you have a couple of hours that you want to waste, and can't think of anything else that would be more entertaining such as this.<br /><br />This is a movie that has always sucked, not before every american teenager decided to quote it, or after everyone knew where the line \\"GIMME SOME OF YOUR TATER TOTS!!!!!!\\" originated from. Not because it has been over-quoted big-time, but because it has no plot or interesting dialogue whatsoever. The movie has no point, except maybe to top Pulp Fiction in being the most misquoted movie ever. The difference is, Pulp Fiction doesn't suck.<br /><br />For some reason, all of the 'goth' and 'emo' kids like this movie and idolize it. Not because they thought it was funny, but because their friend thought it was funny.<br /><br />I'd like someone to explain to me what the hell is so funny about some kid who talks like he's someone's bi*ch? And even if it were funny, why would it be funny when you say it? Well, its not. Almost every review on here that is for Napoleon Dynamite includes the words \\"frickin'\\" \\"gosh\\", or \\"sweet!\\". I would rather be blasted in the face with a shotgun loaded with Al Gore's semen than listen to another one of these horrible renditions of this shi*ty movie.<br /><br />Oh look, the guy needs chapstick! Call everyone!

B000AARKOO|1.0|Kingdom of Heaven was either fueled by inaccurate revisionist history, compiled in the sixties, or by an empathetic drive to guillotine the Catholic Faith.  Whatever the motivation behind this transparently bias and inaccurate portrayal of the crusades, don't depend on this movie for fairness.    The film shamelessly portrays the ENTIRE Catholic clergy not only as heartless, conniving, and vicious villains but altogether diabolical.  Which may have been the entire point of the film because this is the strongest message that you'll come away with.  Sure, in a tense violent age there were undoubtedly some atrocities and abuses to the medieval code of warfare from warring factions on both sides.  However these abuses, in Ridley Scott's view, were committed only by Catholics and the entire Knights Templar; whereas mercy and saintly virtue was practiced by the entire Saracen army and only a small band of Catholics which you can count on one hand: Baldwin IV - the Leper King, his aid Tiberias, Balian, and Godfrey.  That's it.  With the exception of these four, the remaining Christian population, as depicted in this film, are diabolically possessed.    While cherry picking negative scraps from history, Scott runs away with these to blow everything negative he has ever heard about Christianity out of proportion and wrap it all up in one self proclaimed 'epic masterpiece'.  Kingdom of Heaven does a crafty job of making their anti-Catholic message stick.  By luring the audience's attention and emotion with epic battle scenes and the pursuit of peace by a small few Christians, the average moviegoer buys the message that the handful of virtuous Christians are the exception to the rule and that as a whole, Christianity is a false, vicious, bloodthirsty, diabolical, and hypocritical religion.    Before viewing this movie, I prepared myself for a few historical liberties taken to slant the view against Christians, but I was unprepared for the entire film being dedicated to destroying Christianity.  To say that this film is not a documentary is the understatement of the year.  The only accuracies I can recall are the names of a few characters, the name of the city Jerusalem, and the crosses on the crusaders torsos.  After these amateur producers slapped their hastily researched facts together, they rushed out on their own stylized onslaught to recklessly insult and ravage Catholicism with their own personally biased projections.  Hollywood, again, is simply projecting their own typical anti-Catholic biased opinions on history.  They're not only still on the same bandwagon as prejudiced revisionist historians, this movie even puts aside any subtleties and goes beyond anything I've ever seen in Hollywood with a proud and outright blatant attack on Christianity.  Unless you're anti-Christian I wouldn't recommend this beligerantly prejudiced and sloppily researched wrecking ball.    Frankly, as a Catholic, I'm a little tired of being used and abused as Hollywood's old, worn out punching bag.  The bottom line: go somewhere else, other than Hollywood, for fairness and accuracy.  For actually learning something true about the crusades I recommend authors such as Zoe Oldenbourg or Hilaire Belloc.  Their presentation may not be stylistically dramatic but at least they're honest and fair.
B00005JKDR|3.0|I'm not sure what it is specifically about me anymore, but animated films just don't have any magic. When you were young, you used to believe anything & everything you saw on screen. But now, not so much. Is it just me? I chose this film simply because I couldn't get past a guy at the time, and I spotted this. My dad loves these kinda films.<br /><br />The cast has a whole host of famous voices, which you'll have to watch the credits to work out who they are, and then kick yourself, cos you knew who they were all along. They include: Voices of: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and Bonnie Hunt, amongst many more.<br /><br />I didn't like the characters much in this movie, although the little girl, Boo, reminded me so much of Christina Ricci (say it right!) in Mermaids. I have no idea why.<br /><br />The end credits are quite funny, with the list of babies born during the production, no monsters were harmed in the making of this motion picture, and outtakes as well.<br /><br />But the best thing about this DVD? The hilarious short film, From The Birds. I CRIED during this, it was so funny - it got an Oscar as well. I've already watched this short film three times, it's the best thing about this entire DVD. I'd definitely buy this DVD (but probably for my Dad's DVD collection) so I can keep watching this hilarious short. I actually had to pause it during, just so I could calm myself down & stop watching it. I even bought a little mobile phone charm, as it reminds me of the birds in the film.<br /><br />Overall, there is a few funny moments during the film, but otherwise, it was alright. Not really my kinda film, but obviously something was telling me to borrow it, so I can see the brilliance that is From The Birds.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|As in the first film, Bridget Jones (Rene Zellweger) embarrasses herself again and again.  We're supposed to root for her because she's the underdog, but in the universe of these films she's been blessed with cuteness beyond words, a devoted boyfriend (Colin Firth) who forgives everything (despite an endless string of contrived misunderstandings), and a trio of single eunuchs (Sally Phillips, James Callis, and Shirley Henderson) whose sole reason for existence seems to be cheering and supporting Bridget.  In addition, pop songs swirl around her whenever she's feeling sad and pensive.  Given all that, I wouldn't mind trading places with Bridget.    The gifted cast isn't up to the task of saving this one.  It generates an occassional smile but also some genuine grimaces, such as during an embarrasing (for the filmmakers as well as Bridget) sequence in which she is incarcerated in a Thai prison.  Naturally, the downtrodden Thai prostitutes are charmed by the chubby British white girl, hang on her every word, and enthusiastically participate in her impromptu performance of a Madonna song./
B00006879E|5.0|When I first listened to this album I was a little afraid that the album tracks wouldn't be as good as the singles. Luckily I was wrong. Maroon 5 are really great with their own style of music. Adam (lead singer) is a terrific vocalist with tons of styles in his voice, he also has a lot of range. The songs are really amazing. I think that &#34;She Will Be Loved&#34; and &#34;Sunday Morning&#34; are one of my favorite songs but also the songs &#34;Must Get Out&#34; and Tangled&#34; are brilliant. don't miss out on this wonderful album.
0440217563|1.0|Throughout my life, whenever I was faced with unspeakable horrors, famine, disease, or just general unpleasantness, my faith in an all-poweful and merciful God has been as solid and permanent as the Rock of Gibraltar. But after having read Voyager, my faith has been jarred badly enough to wonder why God would permit such a brutality against mankind as this book.<br /><br />For those who care, I have read the previous two installments of Gabaldon's books (reviewed on this site) and I have found them to be sorely lacking, whether from their preposterous plots, unending and pointless tangents that serve no real purpose, loathsome and uniformly bland characters, scant to the point of non-existent historical research in major events (eg, the battle of Culloden), and laughably bad sex scenes that make me think that the author needs to undergo a course of cold baths before she is allowed near a typewriter. Oh, mistake me not, Voyager has all of these dismal aspects as well, but this time they're mixed together in a witches' brew so toxic that I nearly gave up reading out of despair. But sheer pigheadedness prevented me from doing so, as there was no way that amateurish pap like Voyager was going to go alongside true classics like The Illiad and Don Quixote as the only books that have bested me.<br /><br />I sit here and reflect after having endured 1100 pages of this book, and I am still at a loss to explain what occurs, how, why, or even care. There are tremendous gaps in continuity, a leap of faith and logic so severe  that I wound up suffering the literary equivalent of a groin pull (a line written in 1765 from Burns, but Claire swears it's Jamie, even though she's in 1968 at the time, thus propelling her back to 17-who-counts-this-crap), and no explanations given for certain events (Jamie riding up in full fig at the head of a troop of French soldiers after escaping from HMS Porpoise, but no reason why that happened, it just did). If there is anything positive I can say, I found the sailing ship setting to be quite evocative, as I have never laid eyes on such rank bilge in all my life. When Jamie and Claire were hypothesizing about the ancient standing-stone time-travel portals that sent her back 200 years, I thought wistfully to myself \\"Wouldn't it be great if a U-Boat would have passed through one of them in Atlantis, and torpedoed Jamie and Claire's ship, giving them a fitting demise?\\" But alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Since Jamie and Claire are now approaching middle age in this book, we are mercifully spared being witness to them behaving like a pair of demented rabbits as Jamie cocks a leg athwart Claire. Although the quantity is no longer there, the quality has not improved one whit. Gabaldon decides to try to make merry by writing something truly abysmal (a passage of a romance novel Claire is reading states \\"his engorged shaft teased aside the membrane of her innocence\\". yeesh), but then comes along later in the book with this snappy little jewel from Jamie that thuds out of his mouth like a concrete block on your foot. \\"I meant to suckle ye through the thin cotton, 'til your nipples stood up hard in my mouth\\". I honestly cannot make my mind up as to which passage is worse. In lieu of chemical castration, this book should be read to convicted sex offenders as they'll wind up permanently flaccid. Limp, limp, limp writing.<br /><br />To the delusional fans of this series, stop kidding yourselves as this is NOT literature, but indeed it IS the veriest trash. This book is not even good enough to warrant the moniker of \\"fluff\\" as that implies a light, trivial read, but rather this book is a thick, tarry mass all along and throughout, as indigestible as metal filings secreted in your food. I'll be charitable and say that this book must have been the result of a bar bet on Gabaldon's part (after three trays of tequila shooters) going along the lines of \\"I bet you that I can write 1100 pages of pointless drivel that goes absolutely nowhere, and I'll STILL wind up at the top of the bestseller list! Another round, barkeep!\\" In that regard, she has succeeded spectacularly, but at the expense of the reading public. Anything, and I do mean anything, is an improvement by leaps and bounds over this book that should have a bio-hazard warning printed on its cover as warning.goes absolutely nowhere, and I'll STILL wind up at the top of the bestseller list!

B00007GZR5|3.0|I generally love most films featuring the fabulously funny Robin Williams. But it's even better when he does a more serious role, a step away from what he's normally known for. (See also One Hour Photo.) This film is the kinda film I don't think most people would be interested in, but it's worth a look, just to see the interpretations of Heaven & Hell. And a fabulously moving performance by Annabella Sciorra.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this film was the interpretation of Heaven. But each to their own I suppose. Everyone makes their 'own' Heaven apparently, and Chris (Robin Williams) ends up 'living' in his wife's paintings. What's cool is that if she adds to the painting, he sees it too. If she removes it, he sees that as well.<br /><br />It's a hard time for Annabella Sciorra's character, she loses her two children, and then four years later, loses her husband. (And how on earth did they make Robin's character look so YOUNG in some of the flashback scenes?! He looked similar to how he did in his Mork & Mindy days.) She ends up committing suicide, but suicides don't realise what they've done, and go to Hell. (She also looks much younger than she did in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and has managed to find a good hairstylist, and makeup artist.)<br /><br />I much preferred the interpretation of Hell to Heaven for some strange reason. It wasn't stereotyped, like other films, with lots of flames, and a big red devil with a big red fork thing. It was very dark & just so different.<br /><br />You can really feel the chemistry between Annabella & Robin, their love for each other in the film is portrayed so strongly. It is the one film where true love lasts beyond life, and into the next. It almost makes you believe in it.<br /><br />It would be interesting to read a review from a person who doesn't believe in Heaven or Hell I think. I believe in one, but not the other. Kind of. But I'm just so grateful to the director for not doing a stereotypical view of Hell, as I thought it would have happened. This is a terrific film, and if you're not in tears by the end of it, I dunno what to do with you!ew of Hell, as I thought it would have happened.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|Looks like somebody in Hollyweird finally realized there was some place TV's \\"Law & Order\\" had not yet dared to go - the occult! It seems that the 'Exorcist' plot regimen always seems to consist of long discourses on what \\"can't happen\\" in the real world only the completely refute it with a pulse pounding finale. Of course, the real bonus is knowing that this story of 'demonic possession' is based on actual events (if you believe German newspaper accounts), which must have been hushed up by the Catholic Church as I don't seem to recall any 'sanctioned' exorcism headlines in my local newspaper (except perhaps 'The Enquirer'). Supposedly the Catholic Church later recanted the results of the exorcism but I doubt anybody seeing this film will do the same. <br /> <br />As I mentioned above, this is like a court-TV episode (featuring high caliber actors) with all of the attendant witnesses and theories coming first. Then it's 'exorcism' time when the 'last' witness is called to relate the details of the exorcism. And believe me, if you have any kind of religious background, this is the sequence that will have you clutching your crucifix and dousing your body with holy water as each expected 'exorcism' detail is perfectly recreated to 'freaky' perfection.  <br /> <br />That said, I'm sure there are quite a few skeptics who insist they don't believe in the devil and demons so this movie won't affect them. Normally I would agree, except for the fact that this film has the best horror movie cast since the original \\"Exorcist.\\" However, along with 'name' actors like Laura Linney (\\"Kinsey\\"), Tom Wilkinson (\\"Batman Begins\\"), and Campbell Scott (\\"Roger Dodger\\") the actress whose performance will rivet you to the edge of your seat is newcomer Jennifer Carpenter as 'Emily Rose'. She twists her body in more directions than a contortionist and when she becomes possessed by the devil you won't need confirmation from the Vatican to know the evil exists! <br /> <br />Now please don't gorushing into the theater expecting to see and hear a lot of spiritual mumbo jumbo, crucifixes burning flesh, etc. (right off the bat anyway). Eat your popcorn and swig your soda in peace and save your salivating for the grand finale. That way you'll have time to forget about those 'bad' exorcist movies of the past year while fortifying yourself for the freaky finale!
0740748475|5.0|The collection is collected in three sturdy, handsome books.  The binding is durable, the pages are thick and strong.  Though the books are heavy together with the slipcase, each individual book is of a manageable heft.   <br /> <br />Compared to collecting the individual paperback trades, I think this collection is superior.  The strips are all the larger size that Watterson wanted it to be presented for the reader, and the Sunday strips are all in full color.  The rectangular shape of the later paperback trades felt flimsy and unwieldy, but with the sturdy hardcover of the collection, it feels just right.  All of the extras of the treasury editions are included except for the behind-the-scenes commentary in the 10th anniversary edition.  Finally, it's all less expensive than purchasing the lighter individual trades, and a more compact and safe way to store the complete collection for generations to come. <br /> <br />The only reason I think to get the paperback editions is if portability is a high priority and you wanted to read the strips while on a train or outside somewhere.  The collection is definitely made for indoor viewing and you would want to keep the pages smudge, dirt, and food-free (though the thick glossy stock seems easily cleanable). <br /> <br />If you treasure the strip, want to save it for your own children to come, and don't intend to do a lot of portable or outdoor reading, then this collection is right for you.    <br /> <br />
B00097DXZS|5.0|Sony BMG pulls CD software <br />Fri Nov 11, 2005 6:31 PM GMT <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Music publisher Sony BMG said on Friday it would stop making CDs that use a controversial technology to protect its music against illegal copying. <br /> <br />\\"As a precautionary measure, Sony BMG is temporarily suspending the manufacture of CDs containing XCP technology,\\" it said in a statement. <br /> <br />The decision follows the discovery on Thursday of the first virus that uses Sony BMG's CD copy-protection software to hide on PCs and wreak havoc. <br /> <br />A hacker had mass-mailed e-mail with an attachment, which when clicked on installs malware. The malware hides by using Sony BMG software that is also hidden -- the software would have already been installed on a computer when consumers played Sony's copy-protected music CDs. <br /> <br />The malware, a trojan program which appears desirable but actually contains something harmful, tears down a computer's firewall and gives hackers access to a PC. <br /> <br />Sony BMG provided a patch to protect computers against the virus, which is available on its Web site. <br /> <br />\\"We also intend to re-examine all aspects of our content protection initiative to be sure that it continues to meet our goals of security and ease of consumer use,\\" Sony BMG added. <br /> <br />The firm provided software to remove the \\"cloaking element,\\" which enables the virus to hide inside the computer, but the patch does not disable the copy protection itself. <br /> <br />The music publishing venture of Japanese electronics conglomerate Sony and Germany's Bertelsmann AG is distributing the copy-protection software on a range of recent music compact disks (CDs) from artists such as Celine Dion and Sarah McLachlan, according to user groups on the Web. <br /> <br />Sony BMG did not say which CDs or how many CDs were equipped with its software. \\"The XCP software is included on a limited number of Sony BMG content-protected titles,\\" it said. <br /> <br />The Sony copy-protection software does not install itself on Macintosh computers or ordinary CD and DVD players. <br /> <br />When the CD is played on a Windows personal computer, the software first installs itself and then limits the usage rights of a consumer. It only allows playback with Sony software. <br /> <br />The software last week sparked a class action lawsuit in California against Sony, which claimed that Sony had not informed consumers that it installs software directly into the \\"root\\" of their computer systems with rootkit software, which cloaks all associated files and is dangerous to remove. <br /> <br />British anti-virus company Sophos on Thursday offered a tool to disable the copy protection software. ZoneAlarm, a product of Check Point, also protects against the software. <br /> <br />Sony BMG said it stands by content protection technology \\"as an important tool to protect our intellectual property rights and those of our artists.\\" <br />

0399143904|5.0|One reviewer from the New York Daily News said Tom Clancy had \\"serious company\\" in Dale Brown, (from Brown's \\"Fatal Terrain\\"). I have only one word in response to that claim: garbage. While some may be excellent, Tom Clancy still reigns supreme and proves it once again in \\"Rainbow Six\\", (like Clancy ever needs to prove anything!).<br /><br />\\"Rainbow Six\\" takes you into the world of a new multinational anti-terrorism unit, with the missions and chasing down of an entirely new breed of terrorist. While there are the usual breed of idiot terrorists, this new breed is educated, well-funded and so dedicated that they make Al-Qaeda look like a bunch of half-hearted dweebs.<br /><br />Clancy heightens the tension in parts so well, that I actually found myself with an increased pulse-rate and trying not to skip paragraphs ahead to see what happens. The pacing and writing are simply superb and unmatched, in my opinion. This is all the more increased with Clancy tracing various parties involved in the action sequences via short, punchy paragraphs that keep you jumping from the Rainbow team to the \\"bad guys\\" and back again.<br /><br />Clancy writes this book with his usual high level of technical knowledge, and it simply amazes me the diverse knowledge the man has of different subjects. He knows his stuff and it comes through. This adds even more to the air and feel of authenticity.<br /><br />Clancy gives nothing away, and only slowly gives you information as to what the real bad guys are up to. This technique only kept my curiosity raging, so that kept me hooked into the story itself. It was good to have the mystery revealed a bit at a time, and be kept wondering just what they were going to do next.<br /><br />While reading, I did notice that Clancy has his pet phrases, such as characters not \\"adding\\" their thoughts to their dialogue. While the repetition is not a flaw, it was noticeable.<br /><br />For those into military style thrillers, Clancy has again maintained his place at the top of the genre. \\"Rainbow Six\\" is without doubt one of the best books I have read, and certainly the best thriller. A great book with depth and feel, as well as plenty of heart-stopping action and thrills.ithout doubt one of the best books I have read, and certainly the best thriller.

B000063DS1|5.0|Probably one of the best albums of our time. <br />It is also a must-see movie...
B000A3H63Q|5.0|This is the most incledible album out there.  I knew it was gonna be good but they have totally taken it to a higher level.  They have set he standard for extrordinary music and i really berlive that this is the single best album ever produced.  I listen to the whole album at least once a day.
B00007AJGH|5.0|When this movie came out I was 4 and my dad rented it. The Only part of this movie I remember then was Judge Doom scaring the boo boo Gebies out of me. Now that I'm 20 I've seen it 20,000 times. This is one of the most funniest and creative movies I've seen ever. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd give great Performances. And Roger Rabbit is one of the funnest characters on the movie (He sort of reminds me of an early Bugs Bunny) You get the occasional guest spots from some of the best cartoon characters. Donald Duck and Daffy Duck fighting each other just to show off who's better (Favorite Scene). Betty Boop, Dumbo, Yosemite Sam, Droopy, Mickey and Bugs share a scene (A first with these 2 legends.) Also this is one of the last perfomances of Mel Blanc (The voices of the Looney Tunes). The Movie is very high tech for it's time. This is one of the most funniest and greatest movies of all time. Some of the language is kinda bad for kids but not too bad so parents get this movie. I love this movie.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|As a few others pointed out, anyone reviewing this latest DM release and awarding less than 4 stars, are either 1) Not true Dm fans or 2) post 90's DM fans. <br /> <br />I have been a big DM fan for many many years, way before Violator made them popular. IMO SOFAD was there last true DM release, I really didn't think much of Ultra and Exciter, except for the wonderful \\"Home\\". <br /> <br />As a big fan, this is the album I have been waiting for since the late 80's. IMO DM have created a mix of classic songs, yet retained a new and fresh edge to them. Dave's contribution of 3 songs is very unique, and surprisingly very good, \\"Suffer Well\\" being outstanding. Precious is the albums \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", it has a beautiful melody, and is very catchy. Lillian is IMO the best track, and a return to classic DM form, a superb song in every way!. <br /> <br />The album may take a few listenings to really appreciate, especially the second half. This IMO is a future classic DM album, and their best offering for over a decade, and possibly ever!. If you have the chance to catch them on tour (as I did last week), the new songs really come to life and can be fully appreciated. This album is a must buy for any DM fan!.
B000001ESN|5.0|If you ask a hardcore Rush rocker about this album, they will either turn it down or admit dissapointment in it.  Many impressed with \\"2112\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\" thought this was too \\"pop\\".  My mom, for example.    On the contrary, this is one of Rush's best albums, and one of my all-time favorite albums.  Why?  Classic Riffs, Classic Philosophy, Classic Geddy Vocals, And of course, It's RUSH!!!    Here's a track-by-track analysis:    1. The Spirit of Radio - 10/10       This is one of my favorite Rush  songs, along with \\"2112\\" and \\"Limelight\\"  The opening Riff, which is repeated several times in the song, is classic and is often used to portray rush in adverts.  This classic is about  how Radio causes music to lose it's individuality, but still spreads it and flourishes in its glory.   With lyrics like \\"One would like to believe in the freedom of music\\" and \\"It's really just a question of your honesty\\" change everything about how you thought  about the music industry.  Also, it defines radio: \\"Invisible airways crackle with life\\".  This song stuns and makes you rethink drummer Neil Peart's lyrics.    2. Freewill - 9/10       This is a very good song - But there's not much to say.  It's an examination of philosophy from Neil Peart's apparently neutral viewpoint.  All we know is that  he will \\"choose a path that's clear - He will choose Free Will\\".    3. Jacob's Ladder - 8/10       This is Rush going back to the Prog Rock Days of \\"Hemispheres\\".  This song is mostly instrumental, but it is still stunning - Along the lines of \\"War Pigs\\" musically.  By that I mean, dark, minor undertones, and heavy.  The lyrics that are there are beautiful, though.  This song is pure Rush... Including some instrumental weird Tempos including 7/6 and 13/8.  Very much like King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man.\\"    4. Entre Nous - 5/10        I have nothing against this song, but I would expect this more out of ELP than Rush... It's still great, but I'm not a big fan of it.    5. Different  Strings - 7/10       Also an homage to earlier Rush... beginning with a fantasy lyric.  This is a very soft song, and comparable to \\"The Trees\\" in it's musicianship.      6.  Natural Science - 8/10        Another pop-prog song.  It's very catchy, yet quite long.  There are moments of showy musicianship that the band pulls off so well, but this song is mostly about ecology.  Also the album name comes from this song.    Overall, yes, this is RUSH in a pop phase, but the true slump doesn't start  until 1982's \\"signals\\"  This is one of the best Rush albums out there.  Stil, I prefer \\"2112\\", but this is very good for a virgin to RUSH.
B000058983|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul, Pet Sounds, Moby Grape, Revolver, Buffalo Springfield Again, Axis Bold As Love, Who's Next, Highway 61 Revisited, Child is Father to the Man, LOVE FOREVER CHANGES.  In any order; they're all great and all should be heard.\\"  This was the entire review I wrote in Nov. of 2005, placing the album alongside some of the other great albums of the era. Recently I have learned that the lead singer and main songwriter of \\"Love\\", Arthur Lee, is quite sick and needs a bone marrow transplant (something he can't afford). I felt that this album (the highlight of Lee's creative output) deserved a little more.  One of the few racially integrated groups of the sixties, Love blended rock, folk, jazz, and blues in a completely unique way. They were a staple on the Sunset Strip and because Lee didn't like to tour they didn't break out in the same way as The Doors and The Byrd's, but their first three albums were classics and \\"Forever Changes\\" (the third) stands out as one of the best of the time.   The album still holds up well because it's not spacey, folksy or heavy, it's just classy, with a touch of strings and horns used to good effect and an overall mood that is almost hypnotic.  Most of the songs were written and sung by Lee, but the two by the late Bryan Maclean fit right in. There are no long guitar solos or big harmonies here just well crafted songs that add up to what one music poll in England named the number one rock album of all time. I can only hope that Arthur Lee will be able to sing his songs again.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This is my mom's favorite album... :)  and also one of mine.. there's \\"not a bad song on this album\\"  and there are very few albums that can say that.    1. A Farewell to Kings -   A complete and total denouncement of the gentry of the monarchy, to put  it simply.  It starts out, and the album thusly, witha great classical guitar solo, the arpeggio for which was used in \\"The Trees\\" from the album \\"Hemispheres\\".  This song is a rocker otherwise.  Geddy portrays Neil's lyrics perfectly... Here is where we see a lot of the tempo-changing experiments.  For example thechorus of \\"Cities full of hatred, fear and lies / Withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes / Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise / Beating down the multitude and / Scoffing at the wise\\" switches tempos suddenly.. then again in the middle of the next verse... then 3 times in the solo... then for the end.  The last words to this song are \\"Closer to the heart\\", the title of a leter song on this album.  THe two songs are nothing like each other, interestingly enough.      2. Xanadu  Ah, Xanadu.  There is so much to say about Xanadu... from the intro to the chorus of \\"Xan.......Ah..........Duuuuu!!!\\"  The intro is an interesting natural tubular bells-sounding and moog solo. Also implemented is \\"the bell\\" also seen in Cygnus x-1. The song flows very nicely.  THis is  reat to listen to all the way through.  Easily Bored?  Fast foward through the first 2 minutes, but, trust me, you're missing quite a bit of great sound. :)  And if you're REALLY impatient and/or have no appreciation for great rock instrumental sections and/or are a complete idiot, then fast foward to where the lyrics start five minutes into the piece. :) I SERIOUSLY don't suggest it.    3. Closer to the Heart  One of Rush's shorter songs, this philisophical piece discusses the place of the middle class in society.  One of my favorite pieces because of it simplicity yet complexity when you listen to it.  It  is what I call \\"Peartetry (Peart Poetry) in it simplest form, yet one of the most beautiful deliverances by the shrill-voiced Geddy Lee.    4. Cinderella Man  A beautiful song about hanging on to your dreams- Rush's jab at subliminal psychological Messages.  Positive, obviously.  One of my favorite RUSH bass solos, as well.  This is a good song, but does hold it's own, even though it's not one of Rush's most famous songs.    5. Madrigal  Short and Sweet :)... Yes, shorter than \\"Closer to the Heart\\" Like thesong \\"Different Strings\\" from 1980's \\"Permanent Waves\\", It begins with a line that  is about slaying a dragon.  The metaphor is different for each, but the lyrics in \\"Different Strings\\" were taken from this.  This is an easy song to love- but also easy to hate.  It's Rush's first real Intellectual ballad - and one of the best.  The shortest song in Rush's Repertoire at this point.  It is sort of a lead-in for the following song, Cygnus x-1.    1. Cygnus x-1: Book One: The Voyage  cygnus x-1 is a song that will take you places, whether you want to go there or not - so hold on tight.  There is nothing like this song.  This CD is worth it just to hear Peart and the tightness of RUSH on this particular Track. This song has a simple into... followed by the piercing voice of \\"The Lord of Cygnus\\".  We are told of the Constellation of Cygnus, and the black hole Cygnus x-1.  Then, there is amuffled explosion. A bell is rung 6 times... And then the bass line pierces that melody and comes with it's own.      This line sets the stage for the monolith that is to come.  This song switches tempos a great number of times.  It is divided into three movements, each defined by a stunning intro and outro.  again, I offer the advice of \\"Xanadu\\" if you are too stupid/impatient not to appreciate the wonder that is RUSH, fast foward 5 minutes into the song, which is about where the lyrics start.  THe song is about Astronomy and the Space travel that Neil dreams up in his spare time.       In part 2, Geddy really pushes hisvoices to the limit... It's lovely.  You must hear it to believe it.  it switches froma high tremolo back to  his normal screech, low, and back to the tremolo. Then they stop. Then comes in Alex's stunning grungy solo and the accompaning bass line... a bell is rung again.  Wind is heard. A bell is again rung. Wind is heard again. A Bell is rung again. All this time to Alex's two notes being played over and over.  This is my least favorite part of the song, and I'm glad it's short. It's too repetitive for my taste.  Then, at about 7:55 A arrogant in-your face bass line pops out of nowhere.  Being a bassist, I love this.      Then, the whole band creates a massive wall of sound that surrounds you and resultingly eats you up. AFter this wall has atrampled you for a while, lyrics come back, and Geddy rips his vocal cords to pieces shreiking.  Then, suddenly, the wall is broken down all at once.  Alex's signature arpeggios come back.. he plays some chords... and we fade out.  That is the monolitic piece of Power that is Cygnus x-1.  It knocks you down, helps you up, knocks you down again, kicks you, helps you back up, then vanishes into thin air.  It's an unforgettable piece that is the culmination of Rush's previous work.  this song is a hundered times as powerful as anything on this album.  This is overall the best  song on the album, but obviously not the public favorie.  It's mine, though. :)    In retrospect, This is Rush's greatest or Second Greatest albums \\"2112\\" is close or ahead  I suggest this not for Rush virgins - You will not like it.  This is too heavy for one who has not already heard \\"2112\\" or \\"Caress of Steel\\"
B00004TJTS|5.0|I just caught this movie on television. I had never seen it before, but I am a Jack Russell owner myself, so naturally I had to watch. Skip is so much fun and so entertaining. All I can say is it is a wonderful story, but dog lovers beware... I am a 32 year old grown man and my girlfriend and I both have dogs similar to Skip. By the end of the film, I was reduced to a blubbering, sobbing little boy. It will make you realize what a loving bond a man (a boy) and his dog can have.
079284131X|4.0|This was the best of the bunch!  The sequels were pretty good, but didn't compare to this one.  When Chucky was running around, I couldn't figure out whether it was a real person, or a doll. It looked pretty creepy.  This wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it was definitely a cool movie to watch, and very well-made!  If you have dolls in the house, after you watch this movie, you're gonna wish you didn't!
B000AQBA1W|5.0|The Corrs do an incredible job on their newest cd. <br /> <br />Loved the entire Irish feel of the cd, and loved hearing Andrea singing in Gaelic.  Pronounciation and clearity of her Gaelic was amazing.   <br /> <br />Heart Like A Wheel was sung from her heart. Beautiful voice.   <br /> <br />Old Town had a fabulous new twist to it, and Andrea did justice to the song, like usual. <br /> <br />Sharon's lead vocals on Dimming of the Day were phenominal.   <br /> <br />The Irish jigs of Old Hag and Haste To The Wedding were just as great as they always have been.  Andrea's tin whistle skills were apparent, and Sharon on the violin really complimented the song.  You can feel the joy of Irish music through their instruments.   <br /> <br />As anyone could really tell, The Corrs really felt at home while doing this cd. <br /> <br />
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Who's idea was it to make Willy Wonka look like Michael Jackson?  Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson, but I'm talking when he was younger and still black.  I also love Johnny Depp, in almost every movie he's been in, but I really feel he was miscast in this movie! Or at least they should have made him look a little more normal.  The movie had good special effects, and decent acting, but overall it was nothing special.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|Almost too much action, humor and characterization. As far as I know and I eventually see every quality special effects movie, this one is on the cutting edge. I thought it surpassed Lord of the Rings in action and imaginative and special effects, which I thought was fantastic. First rate cinematography and direction, slap stick jokes that seem fresh, even some subtle sexy stuff, with out that or the violence seeming gratuitous. Maybe not for the narrow minded, but this is one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Wow. Scary as hell. that is how you describe the first say 45 minutes of JC. Then it all falls down... <br />This movie is about some monster that eats you and only comes out for a certain amount of time and a certain number of days. So there are theses two kids brother and sister going to visit mom from college. And while driving down the road they are being chased. Freaking scary... So they freakout and bring the thing into town. So now they are in town and find this werid as place and end up going into this well thing. While down there he finds 1000's of death bodys torn up and sowed back together. Great fun. So now everyone in town is dying and you find out the creature is a bat thing....? ( this is where it falls) And so as smart kids do they go into the police station and are like help! and the monster is there too! OH NO! blah blah nothing is happening.... and the end. thats the movie.... Rent <br />Jared
B00005JO1G|1.0|Jarhead, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgaard, concerns a Marine Corps unit preparing to be deployed during the first Persian Gulf war in 1991. This movie fails on so many points, it is hard to describe where to begin. The script and story are inconsistent, murky, and unoriginal, with most of Jarhead's theme taken from earlier psychotic military epics such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. The movie rambles and jumps from one pointless scene to another with very little information to connect them together. The acting in Jarhead is average and headache making with one vulgar performance indistinguishable from the other. The featured characters are mostly portrayed as bored, sex crazed, pornographic, maniacal, Marines despondent at not being able to kill something - anything after only a few months in the Gulf region. The dialogue of Jarhead is simplistic, and the swearing is non-stop with new lessons on how to conjugate the \\"F\\" word and its multiple variations.      Is this the same Marine Corps from World War II that actually fought an enemy for several years and died honorably at remote places such as Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal, or the continuing Hollywood portrayal of temperamental, demented Marines still suffering from the ghosts of Vietnam ? In Jarhead we are led to believe that the soldiers are only a few steps away from an insane asylum after spending a few boring, inactive months in the war theater. Jarhead is a crude motion picture that has very little entertainment value whatsoever. I based my selection of which movie to see on a Friday night on the positive reviews of Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, where can I contact them for a refund ?
B00005KHJV|5.0|This movie is timeless. It is scary in every generation. John Carpenters Halloween is a classic.<br /><br />The movie is about a young high school girl named laurie strode and her skanky friends. They are being stocked by a crazed lunatic named Micheal Myers. So the deaths come rolling in. What makes this movie amazing is the creepyness of it. The way Micheal moves and kills his victums weather its dressing as a ghost with glasses of strangling some girl in a car. He is so scary. The scariest part is when Jamie Lee is crying and she thinks hes dead and you see in the background him getting up in some creppy way and looking over at her. Scary as hell. So I say buy! BUY! BBBUUUYYY!!!<br /><br />Jared O.
B00001QEE7|5.0|You already know how wonderful this movie is, so I will not waste your time with that. I do not actually own this particular dvd set myself, but I was considering it. I just want to let those of you who don't already know and are considering buying this overpriced single disk dvd, DON'T. According to [...] in their upcoming dvd releases, The Little Mermaid will be released as a special PLATINUM VERSION in Oct. 2006 of next year. That is a fact. (Check the website yourself if you don't believe me.) I know it is awhile to wait, but it will be worth it. Besides, some were saying earlier on these reviews that we might not be getting the Little Mermaid Platinum til 2008! So this is much better! I like the rest of you, CAN'T WAIT!!!
0780631684|4.0|I loved it. Great. WOO!! Wow this movie is everything a ummm well good movie... should be?

Great plot line amazing movie BUY BUY BUY <br />Jared
B0006M18YE|5.0|No disputing that this is an excellent jazz album and is one of my personal favourites as well as an essential one to have in any music collector's library.  This remastered version in mini-lp sleeve packaging is simply brilliant! The sound quality is like night and day when I played both the old version and this one back to back. The lp sleeve version is very rare though and I believe only a few are left on the Tower website where I got mine.<br /><br />Every track here though is a jazz standard; Dexter's sense of humour is what truly endears me to his playing as you'll hear him intersperse samples of other jazz standards (Panacea, Tisket a-Tasket, Take Me Out to the Ballgame among others) throughout the album. A man in total control of his instrument and a vital influence on future sax greats like John Coltrane who readily cited him as a major influence. A must have for any jazz lover's music library.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|What's this??: A man who never held a job and never did anything for anyone but himself is neither working class nor a hero. The music is okay, though not as good as the Beatles or Paul McCartney     Apparently, McCartney is a hero, is working class and has a job, since reviewer Doc Savage gave him 5 stars on one of his latest albums, which, by the way, are good but not essential as a John Lennon anthology, like it or not. Reviewer Doc Savage should stop attacking musicians like Lennon and Clapton and many others in a cheap way in his reviews, showing complete ignorance regarding blues music and the history of this century. Defending capitalism and attacking Lennon? Well, shouldn't you be listening to the George Bush II Anthology Vol 3?!Why don't you give peace a chance, for a change?.... strange days indeed, most peculiar... I should remember that Macca was the hardworking man of the Beatles and Lennon was unemployed at best, playing for pennies in the street.  Sorry, but this is simply atrocious.    My thoughts:  This compilation is better, in my opinion, than Lennon Legend. It has the Real Love version with piano. The problem is that Lennon's great outtakes are in many different albums with some filler in them. Tracks in anthology and Menlove Ave and Milk and Honey should probably be compiled by each fan. Anyway, for someone who is not familiar with Lennnon and wants to hear a bit more, this is THE compilation. If you want a single cd, go for Lennon Legend.
B00097DXZS|4.0|I think this cd shows the classic guitar style of Carlos Santana... And that is a good thing! I especially LOVE the song Brown Skinned Girl with BO BICE in it. Too bad the critics arent playing this one yet, as I think Brown Skined Girl should have been the first released title off the track! All in all, I loved the entire cd with the exception of the songs that are done in all Spanish parts. Because I cannot understand Spanish. But, I give it 4 stars and say it is worth picking this one up!

0307276902|1.0|I don't believe a word of it. <br /> <br />Leaving aside the fact that this book is over 400 pages of two-dimensional characters spouting trite dialogue in contrived settings, there are too many factual inconsistencies to find this book credible. <br /> <br />Maybe this guy did go to Hazeldon, maybe he didn't. But this book is fiction. That would be fine if it were well-written, but that's the worst of it - even if every single thing reported in these pages actually did happen, it's so badly written that I hope it's not true because it would be an insult to the people involved. <br /> <br />I have read a number of memoirs which document battling addiction. This one...I think it's a scam to make money and not in any way an honest document. I want my money back and the 5 hours of my life I spent reading it. (Yes, I finished it because I didn't think I had a right to comment without giving it a full read.)
B000B2YQX4|1.0|Please listen to this new album very carefully. Playing the Angel is not as good as Violator and any of the old Depeche Mode albums. The new hit song, \\"Precious,\\" does not seem to end very well. The band should have repeated the chorus one more time at the end. It ruined my listening experience.
068987474X|2.0|I have to agree with the minority concerning this book.     I do agree with many of the, although overly simplistic, rationalizations in this book. I feel that many women give \\"losers\\" more credit than they deserve. However, I submit to you today many situations are not this black and white.     If the women who really need to read a book like this could possibly be totally enlighted after the some 150/bold-type pages contained in this book (Maybe the next version will have pictures too...oh goody!), there would be no reason for a book like this to exist at all. Or at least it would have been written a long time ago.    Let's face it ladies; our emotions are a complicated thing. Feeling that you will somehow be \\"set free\\" or have \\"more power\\" after reading this book is highly unrealistic. Getting over someone you have feelings for is a process that won't happen over night.    I have to say Mr.Behrendt is a very smart man. In fact, he should apply for a position with Osssma Bin Laden. Seeing as that he used the same simplistic strategy: You find out what a certain group's weaknesses are and you capitalize off that weakness. Ossama's plan was to simply crash a plane into the fincancial mecca of a capatilsitic society.     Greg Behrendt found out that women want to feel powerful, \\"sought after\\", and strong so he wrote a book telling women how stupid they are for waiting on a man who might for many reasons be taking too long. Who would argue with that? Who wants to still look dumb after reading \\"Men 101\\".    The message is that if you can force yourself to somehow become callous and unconcerned this makes you \\"Powerful\\".    Woman you are smart and beautiful and you don't need a book to tell you that. Emotions are a good thing. They separate us from the animals. All men are not the same but only time will make the difference. Recognize an elaborate stereotype when you see one. Recognize a scheme.

B000059Z8J|5.0|When \\"Superman the Movie\\" was released, the last major comic to live action adaptation was the Batman TV series.  Superhero stories were relegated to being camp at best.  At worst, it was fodder for poorly written Saturday Morning Cartoons.<br /><br />Richard Donner changed all of that.  His decision to play Superman straight and set the story in a world very like our own was probably the most influential decision of the last 25 years.  Literally dozens of films have used a similar formula to adapt familiar, but not highly regarded material.  Donner's Superman serves as the template for how to these films right.<br /><br />Donner and writer Tom Mankewicz were extremely smart about culling out the elements of the Superman myth that had enabled it to survive.  They made Krypton both alien and mythic.  They sold the fantasy of a wholesome, rural American upbringing that would form the mainspring of the TV series \\"Smallville\\".  Perhaps most importantly, they placed the two person love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane and Clark Kent at the center of the action.<br /><br />The performances are all very strong.  Every actor who has tackled Superman since Christopher Reeve has compared unfavorably.  His chemistry with Margot Kidder is very strong as well.  Of course, Gene Hackman utterly re-defined Lex Luthor.<br /><br />The visual effects still hold up for the most part.  The sequence with Superman flying about on his first night in Metropolis is still amazing 25 years later.  Overall, the film has held up better than I could have hoped.
0553801503|4.0|I want to start by saying that I am a reader that can be very hard on my authors that I read.  I expect only the best from them due to they get paid for their job of writing and should always focus on the story at hand instead of getting too broad or off topic in their writing. <br /> <br />Because of this, I had to step back from \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and think about the fact the George R.R. Martin tried to have the best intentions in not upsetting the reader while trying to fairly tell the tale he wants to.  Due to this, I have to say it was a smart move to split the books and divide the characters up into two stories that will happen at the same time. <br /> <br />Mr. Martin even says on his website that, \\"I know some of you may be disappointed, especially when you buy A FEAST FOR CROWS and discover that your favorite character does not appear, but given the realities I think this was the best solution... and the more I look at it, the more convinced I am that these two parallel novels, when taken together, will actually tell the story better than one big book.\\"  I have to say I trust him in his decision. <br /> <br />So based on the fact that I believe he is a fine author with a good head on his shoulders and understands the readers whoes, I must say that \\"A Feast for Crows\\" was a good first half of the whole story and that when \\"Dance for Dragons\\"(second half) comes out, the whole story of what took place just after the war will be a lot better overall.
B000059XUI|3.0|I loved this movie in its original release.  The action sequences were hugely exciting for their time, but the effects have dated badly in parts.  The majority of the flaws from a story perspective appear to be a direct result of the famous production problems.<br /><br />First, the good news is that the basic story of \\"Superman II\\" is great.  The idea of forcing Superman to chose between being with the woman he loves and serving the world is a excellent.  Many of the scenes between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder are worthy extensions of the material in the first film.  The threat posed by the General Zod and his allies adds a lot of tension that was not present in the first film.  The idea of insane super humans rampaging is a compelling one.  Terrance Stamp is unforgettable as Zod.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the tone of the film is very inconsistent.  It can range from borderline dramatic in one scene to outright camp in the next.  Many sequences are excellent, but the film does not fit as tightly together as you would hope.  The fight in dowtown Metropolis is still exciting, but the climax in the Fortress of Solitude is awful.  It is extremely lazy, as Superman and his rivals acquire new abilities in the middle of the fight.  This is a symptom of poor fight choreography.<br /><br />However, what very nearly fataly undermines the film is the cursory manner in which the central plot line is discarded.  The Superman/Lois break-up is under-motivated. Two films of build up ends with a random \\"super-kiss\\" that makes the whole plot-line disappear from the memory of a major character.  This is Bobby Ewing in \\"Dallas\\" level sloppiness in writting.<br /><br />Overall, there are more good points than bad in \\"Superman II\\".  On DVD, the chapter mode is wonderful for watching this type of film.  It is easy to select the good parts and ignore the bad.
B00005JO1G|3.0|Jaky Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Highway) stars as Anthony Swoffard who is in the deserts of Saudi Arabia where he is being trained by Sgt. Sykes played by Jamie Foxx (Ray, Collateral), to get ready for the on coming war. Swofford becomes a sniper and his spotter is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Darkly funny and some scenes with power make JarHead interesting and the direction is amazing, be it explosions or soldiers walking along burnt cars or oil fields at night on fire with is scary and beautiful at the same time. Also starring Chris Cooper (Capote, October Sky), Jacob Vargas (Nexy Friday, Traffic), Lucas Black (Crazy In Alabama, Sling Blade) and Dennis Haysbert (Tv's 24, Absolute Power) They got refrences from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Giant with James Dean.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|It is two years since at the end of The Bourne Identity, we left the wholesome, good looking all-American boy turned former CIA assassin with amnesia Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) to live happily ever with his grunge hippie girlfriend Maria (Franka Potente of Run, Lola, Run fame) on a sunny Greek island.<br /><br />Maybe it was they wanted to escape the Olympics he could of won a swag of gold medals in, but Paul Greengrass's sequel The Bourne Supremacy opens with the couple living \\"off the radar\\" amongst the sunny beaches of Goa, India.  Framed for the murder of a CIA case officer in Berlin, Bourne must leave this paradise not just to find out more about his past, but come to terms with how this knowledge affects the man he has become.<br /><br />You don't need to of seen The Bourne Identity to understand what is going on. Like with Bourne getting his memory back, you're given just enough information not to feel lost, but need to know more. The story revolves around the CIA investigation of a Russian oil tycoon, his possible involvement in the murder of a moderate Russian politician and the theft of a lot of CIA money. It all sounds as plausible as if it came from last week's newspaper.<br /><br />Damon's Jason Bourne is an interesting, sympathetic character placed into the middle of an already riveting story. He is a super spy who has paid for his talents by having no life. It is implied he and the other super agents of the \\"black on black\\" Project Treadstone were given their skills through the use of drugs, brainwashing and hypnotherapy with the side effect of turning them into potential psychopaths. The guilt and pain he feels as who ever he was before bleeds back into his personality is more brutal then any of the fight or action scenes.<br /><br />But yes, there are many of those and they are a joy to watch. Bourne fights and car chases his way through Goa, before heading off to Naples, Munich, Berlin and then finally Moscow.  Greengrass knows how to do action scenes with a documentary style so like the story; they had at least some air of plausibility to them. Also, it is interesting to see these cities at the street level. Around the action people are going about their daily lives in a studied detail the camera doesn't just whiz by.<br /><br />As a spy film this is worth seeing. As a film exploring how a man will work through the guilt he feels over a life he barely remembers, it is really worth taking a look.ction scenes with a documentary style so like the story; they had at least some air of plausibility to them.

0671027387|2.0|This is my first Dan Brown book, and I bought it solely based on the synopsis on the back cover -- a conspiracy involving NASA and political intrigue and supposedly a big \\"shocker\\" of a secret. Like most of the other posters here, I blew through this book fast, but it's an unsatisfying read.<br /><br />What bothers me most (aside from the flat characters) is how Brown is always explaining how things work. This isn't against the rules for a novelist -- Tom Clancy has written some good books doing it -- but it's not done well here.<br /><br />In one scene, for example, when a political character is deciding how best to attack an opponent on TV, Brown goes into an aside and offers lengthy definitions of the various strategies. (He uses the phrase \\"This is called\\" and other variations whenever he launches into lecturer mode.) Brown does this throughout the book, and while it's somewhat helpful when he's describing mosquito-sized cameras employed by the bad guys in the early chapters, I got sick of it pretty fast. As Stephen King has said: If you want to preach, get a soapbox and head to your local park.<br /><br />On the plus side, I did sort of enjoy some of the elaborate plot, at least in terms of its complexity. Brown does invent some clever double-crosses, and I guessed wrong more than once. But the big finale -- set on a boat -- is pretty ridiculous, as is the way Rachel and Michael hop in the sack on the last page in a scene that's unintentionally funny.<br /><br />I still hope to read The Da Vinci Code before the movie comes out, but this book has depressed my expectations.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I normally don't take the time to write reviews for movies I like but I feel that in this case I absolutely must. This movie is magical. The enduring kind of love Christian, the very handsome, Orphic, penniless poet, and Satine, the beautiful (inside and out) courtisan who has sold her hope to Sidler and the Duke, represents some of the best on screen chemistry I've yet seen in film.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|What this film has going for it is an amazing display of great effects and visually stimulating scenery and some wry and sarcastic lines from Depp. While Gene Wilder's Wonka was a character that was strange but loveable, Depp's is well just strange. The oompah loompahs do get more speaking parts and sing actual lyrics from the actual book which coming from Dahl are naturally very cute and funny with just an aspect of the bizarre. What the film lacks is that emotional charge that made the audience sympathetic to Charlie - of course the title is a misnomer - this film is all about Wonka. While this film is a completely different film from the original it is still worth seeing. I will say that I like the original better but this is an interesting take on the same story.
B00000G3I2|3.0|Seven college friends gather for the suicide funeral of one of their clique; separated for years, mildly estranged and rediscovering each other like diaries in an attic. <br /> <br />A chick-flick clothed in tracksuit pants, lord help us all if we didn't somehow relate to these 1980-something characters, with their yuppie elitism and consumerist lan; forced to live in denial of their anti-establishment pedigree to accept the fact that their fashionable mid-life careers are anything but revolutionary. <br /> <br />So often in life we are reminded that our best friends are those whom we created before we created ourselves; they spurred our shape-shift into the beings we would become - hence the over-arching nostalgic poignancy to this movie, as we realize the person with whom we are watching it is *not* one of those initiates. Got news for you: they're thinking the same thing. <br /> <br />Self-analytical to a fault, yet oddly compelling due to intelligent dialog and a flawless ensemble cast, every character examining their purpose in life and, in the course of a weekend, apparently discovering it.  <br /> <br />Believe enough of this introspective guff and we'll *all* be slashing our wrists. <br /> <br />
0783240236|5.0|A great movie that stands true today and doesnt need the multimillion dollar special effects most newer movies rely on.What a terrific cast! Tippi Hedren is very good in it and, god, is she beautiful! The scene where she is waiting outside the school with the crows collecting on the jungle gym behind her is so damn suspenseful. Interesting that there is no music in it whatsoever. The tension and scares are created by the shrill cries of the birds (real and electronic) themselves -- it had the same heartstopping effect that the violins did in the shower scene in \\"Psycho.\\" <br />
B000001EXR|5.0|Something happened to Kiss before they re-donned the makeup in 1996 - they grew up.    The *Carnival Of Souls* album displays a ferocious maturity, unmatched by any Kiss album to date. A sweeping statement to be sure, especially pertaining to a band whose career has lasted longer than fully half their fan-base's lifetimes. But I choose my description carefully: \\"maturity\\" being the key word.     No more lyrics rooted in pawdying and pussying - Abandon All Innocence Ye Who Enter: evocative themes abound, as varied as lost youth and suicide, paternal dedication, false religion, concrete jungle nights, introspective emptiness... a regular carnival of soul!    Standout tracks include: the somehow-nostalgic \\"Childhood's End\\", Paul's dedication to his son, \\"I Will Be There\\", the rumbling, tumbling \\"Jungle\\", the doomsaying \\"It Never Goes Away\\", the cello-tinged, jagged-beaten \\"I Confess\\" - but seriously, they're *all* winners.     Simmons' and Stanley's songwriting is at a peak they will probably never attain again, ensconced as they now are in the \\"nostalgia\\" game, till world's end we presume. Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick are at long last entrenched musically as Band Members, and add volumes to Gene and Paul's dynamism, Kulick carving memorable Frehley-ish licks to Singer's succinct, whiplash pummeling (one of the few drummers who can pull off double-kick with taste and finesse!). A tragedy that these two musicians were lost to the makeup craze (- at least Singer is back in the fold, lending his awe-inspiring limbs to The Cat's prowess).    Of course I can appreciate the wild nostalgia of youth and the \\"magic\\" that certain periods in history evoke, but in putting this as simply as possible: this album's songwriting, performance and production are unequalled in the Kiss oeuvre. Sure, I'd be as inclined as the next Starchild to spin \\"Strutter\\" over \\"In The Mirror\\" - but the two songs should not even stand side by side on the above aspects, separated as they are by over twodecades of personal growth, loss, career swoons and startling amounts of puss-in-boots.    Due to unfortunate circumstances of politics and marketing, though *Carnival Of Souls* was recorded in 1995, its release was staved off until 1997, when the Reunion momentum was well underway. It made Kiss look confused; it confused Kiss fans. And any shelved album always casts doubts on that album's intrinsic worth. I meet fans even today who are debating on whether to purchase this album.     Darker, deeper, more dangerous than any of the bands whose \\"modern\\" sounds Kiss emulated on this album, it intimates a bold, unapologetic direction they would have taken had the Reunion never been. Haphazardly packaged, unknown and unadvertised, this release is pure Black Diamond. Buy it - you've got Nothin' to Lose...
B000ASDFJU|5.0|If you waited to now you are in luck, the complete series for less than 200 is a good deal.If you have already bought individual years in the cheap plastic cases then you are out of luck. I fortunately waited and am very happy with this set.
B000002GWN|4.0|In 1974 Joni was at the top of her national fame and this live albumn is full of short selections from her previous albumns. The music was recorded over 4 consecutive nights of live concert and knowing this, I would have loved to have been there all four nights! The strength of the CD lies in the selection of the 18 songs.  <br /> <br />There are the fun, witty, love and social commentary songs such as \\"You Turn Me On I'm A Radio\\" and \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\". There are the amazing love-lost songs that haunt you like a ghost, such as \\"A Case of You\\" and \\"The Last Time I saw Richard\\". There are also the philosphical works, reflecting on the nature of human existence - its joys and sorrows - such as \\"Both Sides Now\\" and \\"The Circle Game\\".  I especially like the jaded sophisticated songs that reflect Joni's superstar status, such as \\"People's Parties\\". <br /> <br />As a popular poet, Joni ranks with Robert Browning, a philospher in love that tells great stories.
0380018179|3.0|I just now finished reading this book. In fact I got this book only after seeing my uncle reading CM's Historical Ceaser & Rome related books. <br /> <br />Right at the start I knew that this book is meant to be for women. The way 4 year old Maggie Cleary is described, u immediately come to know that she is different in a way women in our Indian Hindi movies are portrayed, extremely sensitive, and one who suffers all pain and never expresses it or complaints about it. Right at the start you know that it's full of women's inner feeling. And specially feeling that very few of them is capable of entertaining lest they want to be labeled as a sentimental fool. But yet they are very rare, touching and agonizing feeling.  <br /> <br />Right at start you also come to know that this is story about life and its philosophy because you never know enough of life unless you are on the wrong side of life that is when you have a life that is devoid of everything...a sufferers life, a life of poverty. And while reading this book all those affluent and rich people get a chance to live proxy life of a poor through Cleary family. But one thing different in this Cleary family is that this is story of poor people who contrary to general expectation don't buckle under hardship of poverty and loose all sense of dignity and finery of life's behaviors and emotions and its feeling, but stick to them and are more admirable and lovable. And emerge out as people, who give in more to such feeling in hardship when it truly required to be shown. <br /> <br />But its written in Mills & Boon style...full of sweet clichd words and diabetic romanticism (though that is how most people love to feel and live and suffer for love) though some of the description and dialogues related to morality and ambivalent desires of hearts and some love making scenes are the one that make this book worth reading. Above all it's the pain author has inflected on its characters knowingly expectedly, unknowingly and unexpectedly that makes a reader keep on turning pages of this bulky book. <br /> <br />But after reading this book I did realize that someone like me who has lived in poverty and has indulged in love luxuriantly would truly admire this book. For the pain you get being good and poor is something you really cherish and sometimes you want more of it as a nihilist does. It goes for sacrifice too, the more deeply and acutely u feel love and are denied of it, the more of that love you want. For what is love if you can not endure separation and pain and what is life if you can not suffer its hardship and maintain your dignity? <br /> <br /> <br />I think being a semi historical author now CM must be feeling odd while acknowledging this book and she must have written this when she herself must have suffered bout of romantic delusions and eventually would have decided to paint her own feeling in sweeping epic saga spanning three generations and hundred years. And she has been successful in doing so. <br /> <br />
0060536357|4.0|There are plenty of good summaries of this book here, so I'll briefly make one point:  this book is a good read, but the business climate has changed dramatically since it was written, and many of the characters here are retired or have moved to very different investing styles.  So the book is worth reading, but I'm not convinced it is as timely as say Lowenstein's books on the Internet bubble or Hedge Funds, or any of the many Enron books out now.
B000AP04L0|4.0|Anyone who has worked in an office will probably recognize a lot things in this movie--from the office machines that never work to the claustrophobic cubicles.  There are many memorable characters, from the smarmy boss to the mumbling paper shuffler to the beer-swilling neighbor of Peter, the main character.  This is a hilarious fantasy-come-true about three guys who stick it to the company by creating a virus which will funnel company money into an account in their names.  Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's girlfriend but her role is pretty minor compared to the more interesting characters described above.  When you're in the mood for a laugh, this movie would be a good choice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When this show debuted the networks tried to bill Firefly as a \\"Hip\\", \\"Funny\\", Sci-Fi Western. I still remember the quick-flick promo commercials. <br /> <br />    \\"Hip\\": that word has been used so much it has lost its original meaning. Firefly stayed away from Star Trek cliches and worse. It was crafted deeply and thoroughly so that nothing in the sets, the FX or the characters would make it \\"Dated\\". It is just as clean to watch NOW in the age of IPods, as it was years and years ago. The show is not about Technology-- It's about people. That's people with a small 'p'. People like us. Not loverboy Captain Kirk. Not Stuck up Janeway. Not \\"Give-me-a-break\\" Paternal Picard. Mal is just. . .Mal. Like River said: \\"Bad, in the Latin.\\"  <br /> <br />    \\"Funny\\": In TV land, to call a show Funny is to tell the average viewer they are watching a comedy show. And the average viewer (And I'm not being insulting) who wants to see a comedy is turned off when they are subjected to something different and edgy. Firefly is \\"Witty\\" in the dramatic way: Edgy, Cutting-- its humor is the smile that comes between sorrows. The laugh is evoked seamlessly without need of an actor's pause for the laugh-track. There are NO lauigh-tracks. In fact, the scene has already moved past the moment that has you chuckling. And in the next instant, blood will pulse from a knife slash and no-one's smiling anymore. The characters are in pain, leaving the formerly chuckling audience wincing in sudden deep, quiet discomfort. Your average TV viewer does not like being made unconfortable by a show they were told would  be \\"funny\\". That, in turn, made the TV Exec's uneasy. Firefly was not following a formula. Even the sexuality woven into the show was NOT following TV land conventions. It was all tension, tension, tension- with no simple happy resolution at the end of the hour.   <br /> <br />   \\"Sci-Fi Western\\": Admittedly, a different approach, a flavor. But \\"western\\" can also be a term of derision. Forget Western and think \\"Frontier\\" in its classic sense. You only see a horse once in a LONG while for the entire series. Cows-- only once or twice. But remember that the Westerns that endure to this day were about the stories of the people on the prairie-- not the Prairie itself, not the horses, not the guns. Think about it--- A horse is a cheaper means of transport on a planet without roads. And Cows? Man without Beef? Never! <br /> <br />   A fan of \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" would see a parallel here.  <br /> <br />   Firefly is NOT a failed Series. TV/Cable/Broadcast Media Failed to recognize a well crafted piece. <br /> <br />   The Movie Serenity will complete this partial gem. I suggest you watch Firefly now. By the time Serenity is available, and in your player, everything will slide into place as the season finale that never happened all those years ago.

0684824906|4.0|Neither a military history of Lincoln's handling of the Civil War nor a legislative history of his Administration. His great speeches get surprisingly short attention. But a book that sticks close to what is promised in its title. <br /> <br />I found the first part of the book the strongest. The background on the main rivals for the Republican nomination in 1860, why Lincoln won the nomination in Chicago, and how all these main players were then incorporated into the new Administration is a story very nicely told by Doris Kerns Goodwin. The contrast with the other main political stars of the day reminds one that while Lincoln had many personal hardships to deal with, so did many others of that era. <br /> <br />On the down side, I think the author spends too much time on Kate Chase, the daughter of a rival to Lincoln, and bends too far over backwards in excusing Mary Todd Lincoln's near theft of public funds and generally difficult behavior. <br /> <br />One minor episode within the book, the process of nominating Salmon P. Chase to be chief justice, is made even more interesting because of current events. (He was nominated to the Senate on December 6 by President Lincoln and sworn in just nine days later.)
B00000JJQK|5.0|Many people call this one of the greatest albums in the world, but I think that's only because they read that one issue of Rolling Stone. Pet Sounds is not my favorite album ever, it's not even my favorite Beach Boys album (Friends and Wild Honey are my faves), but I love it nonetheless. Not for the production, not because it was ahead of its time. None of that nonsense. Pet Sounds, to me, represents the summers when I would drift off to sleep listening to it and staring at the ocean on the horizon outside my window. When I would feel exceptionally lonely and just listen to \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" again and again and again. When I would listen to the lyrics of That's Not Me and try my hardest to imagine would he could be talking about. When I would complain about this punk/ska-type CD my sister would listen to... until their cover of Sloop John B came on, and we would be singing along together, and vice/versa for when I was listening to Pet Sounds. When me and my (then) new girlfriend decided \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" would be our song.<br /><br />This album was not any sort of monumental listen for me in terms of sound quality or harmony between instruments or anything like that. Pet Sounds was the soundtrack to my life.

B000002LIR|4.0|Storyteller does not contain all of Stewart's best material. In fact, if you want all of Stewart's best songs, then just get his first 4 solo CDs, 4 CDs with The Faces, his CD with Jeff Beck (Truth) and skip Storyteller. I think these 9 CDs - released over just a 4-year period! - rival anything the Stones or Zeppelin ever did.  <br /> <br />But if you want to hear a representative overview of his career - the good, the bad, and the ugly - then Storyteller is a good buy. Clearly, Stewart is an excellent singer and very talented, and some of his recent CDs (Vagabond Heart) are respectable, but today is generally hack.

0307276902|2.0|I know I'm in the minority, but I expected this book to be riveting and it just wasn't.  The author is self-indulgent and takes liberties with the truth to such an extent that one doesn't know what to believe.  Is this really autobiographical, or a work of fiction loosely based on his life? <br /> <br />It seems Frey wants us to believe all of this happened to him, word for word.  But when I got to the part about his teeth getting fixed, I finally had to admit he was probably fabricating events for dramatic effect.  Anyone who has ever had a root canal, and been fitted for caps, knows that this procedure does not take place in one sitting.  You don't go into the Dentist's Office with broken teeth and then a few hours later shake hands with the Dentist, thank him and bid him farewell, and walk out with your Teeth all fixed!  You get molds made, temporary caps put on, wait a few Weeks for your caps to get made, then go in later and have them put on.  Give me a Break! (See, I can do the random caps thing too.) <br /> <br />And I'm not sure, having never been an addict myself, but it seems to me that even someone in recovery and detox could be administered a few shots of Novacaine without any adverse reactions.  Come on! <br /> <br />But worst of all, I was a very surprised at how boring this book was, after hearing Oprah and all her friends gush about how they read it in one sitting, and how it kept them up reading all night. <br /> <br />If you want to read a good book of fiction about a bad boy in an institution, read \\"One Few Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\"  It is much less yawn-inducing than this book.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|the first time i listened to this album i thought, 'oh, this is pretty cool.' the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, & 5th times i listened i thought, 'HOLY HELL! turn this thing up!' i don't know what the previous reviewers dogging on 'John the Revelator' had in their ears, but in my ears was the best 'stomp' DM song since Personal Jesus, and every single bit as good, and the rest of the album follows suit. Flat out, this album ROCKS! Exciter is one of the only DM albums that just didn't do it for me (my fav is Songs of Faith & Devotion, then Violater... (yeah, i know), then a toss up of Ultra, and some of the older ones like Music for the Masses & Black Celebration which are echoed in a distant way with synth melodies in this new one. oh yeah, & now THIS is in the top three of my fav DM albums). this is a brilliant return to form. DM are the Rolling Stones of electronic music, they've been around for over 20 years and they're still kickin' ass and takin' names. GET IT!

B00007L4MJ|5.0|Kudos to the restoration team behind this edition of \\"Metropolis\\".  Despite missing scenes they have delivered a product, aided by title cards, that has a coherent narrative.  It took me a while to cozy to this film because the exaggerated acting style in silent films took me aback at first.  Once I overlooked that aspect I was hooked.  Yes this film is a visual stunner, however, the underlying theme is cooperation between the industrialists and working classes and director Fritz Lang does not lose sight of that.  The films tagline is \\"The Head and the Hands Need the Heart to Perservere\\".  This theme is delivered tactfully by Lang without being heavyhanded.  What I found interesting is there are any number of subtle and none too subtle Biblical references throughout the narrative of \\"Metropolis\\".  For that matter there's alot of food for thought on hand here.  Today's makers of fantasy films should use this film as an example.  Pyrotechnics are fine but a work of lasting art needs grand ideas and noble intentions.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|Save your money for the inevitable Remastered, properly mixed set. Very disappointing for a loyal Rush fan. Buy Different Stages instead.
B0000027F8|5.0|Never having been a fan this album changed my opinion of George Michael as he reached a truly different plateau with some vey complex and wonderfully expressed pieces. This is NOT your average George Michael album but something more moving in a  direction that was unfortunatley cut short by Sony's lack of support.  <br /> <br />Possibly the most aptly named album in history - as the man says 'listen without prejudice'
B00025ETIW|5.0|These guys are awesome, but you can't enjoy them fully just by listening to the CD. I'm telling you guys, (especially the more hardcore-rock/metal fans reading this) that you have to see them live to FULLY enjoy them. You wouldn't think it from listening to the CD, but there are alot more songs that you can headbang or mosh to that you wouldn't think about. These guys are crazy live, and if you ever get the chance to see them in concert, jump at the chance! I know I will, considering we had to wait until like one of the last nights for their tour and they said that they're not sure when they're gonna be coming here again, or even if they WILL be coming in the area on their next tour. <br /> <br />With a song like \\"Thank You for the Venom\\" on here, you just have to love the CD. Buy it? Definatately. See them in concert? Without a moment's hesitation.
B000002OZY|5.0|Theres not much more to say about this record. Pure genius....buy it....you wont be dissapointed.
B0006L16N8|5.0|<br />After one disregards all the hyped expectations for the much-anticipated X&Y, it's not hard to appreciate the album's consistent high quality. I don't think anything tops \\"Clocks\\" or \\"The Scientist\\", but Coldplay keep their momentum with strong tracks like \\"Square One\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"Low\\", and \\"Twisted Logic\\".
B000BB1MI2|4.0|This movie is a fun adventure worth going on.  The visual effects are amazing as you see stark lines and bright vibrant colors.  Johnny Depp did a great job with his character.  The surreal world, although a little out there, was fun and entertaining. <br /> <br />Granted, this show wouldn't be for children on many levels, but I kind of knew this going into it, how is it hard for parents to not expect this?  Some scenes are hilarious, such as the squirrels checking to see if Veruca is a bad nut, or the elevator scenes with Willie Wonka running into it.   <br /> <br />This movie does stand on its own and shouldn't be compared to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  This rendition is, in fact, following the book more closely than the older version.  Add that to the darker more adult humor and you have a fun movie with its own concept.  Finally, the movie ends portraying the happy family, ends by leaving you with a smile and feeling good.   <br /> <br />Watch the movie for itself, don't watch it with the intention of seeing a remake of the older one.  A fun and enjoyable movie.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|Well, I love the original version.  I watched the new version of the film and then re-watched the old one and the old one was so much better.  The child actors played the parts especially better than the children in the new version of the movie.  The new one is just over-the-top and seems to force computer technology in our faces to make up for the lame acting.  If you loved the original, this will be fun to watch and compare, but you will find yourself being loyal to the old version. Worth a rent, but that's it.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is one of the best albums. Ever. Period. It's definitely up there with other groundbreaking metal releases like Master of Puppets, Rust in Peace. But this is certainly the highpoint of Dream Theater's career and they will never again release an album this good. This album is a concept album, and although I know the plot I will not try to explain it to you. Try Wikipedia. <br /> <br />People like me will often compare this release to Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime. And in awesomeness, this totally matches it.  <br /> <br />The album starts with a psychiatrist's voice, counting down from ten for his patient to reach total relaxation. After he counts one, a gentle acoustic guitar starts strumming a few chords with James LaBrie, who is at an all time high with this album, singing over it. This track is called Regression. <br /> <br />What's great about this album is that there is a few riffs, and licks and general music ideas that is used again in different songs. If you listen to the Dance of Eternity back to back with Images and Words's Metropolis part 1, the song where this album came from, it sounds very similar.  <br /> <br />ANYWAY, the track after Regression is Overture 1928, a high point of the album. It is an upbeat instrumental with great soloing from Petrucci, and great keyboard parts from the new guy, Jordan Rudess.  <br /> <br />The last riff of Overture 1928 begins the third track, Strange Deja Vu. Great song, great parts from everybody.  <br /> <br />After that, a short piano piece starts with LaBrie singing over it. The piano piece gets darker, and this begins Fatal Tragedy, a freaking awesome song. Great soloing from Petrucci. <br /> <br />The second best song on the album starts off after Fatal Tragedy with a riff from Petrucci. This begins the eleven minute 22 second track called Beyond this Life. Later in the song, Dream Theater shows their down to earth rock roots with a sweet riff from Petrucci and James LaBrie wailing SHE WANTED LOVE FOREVAAAA!! Great song.  <br /> <br />After that Scenes from a Memory goes downhill with Through Her Eyes, mainly because it tries to rip off Pink Floyd's \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", but the singer in this song isn't nearly as amazing as Pink Floyd's guest star. Through Her Eyes sucks. <br /> <br />But of course, that doesn't matter because it is followed by Home, the best song on the album and probably the best song Dream Theater have ever recorded. Almost 13 minutes long, this song blows everything else out of the water. It is heavy, epic, and features amazing solos from Petrucci and Rudess. It ends accordingly, with a big sounding open D power chord leaving people's ears ringing. You need to listen to this song a few thousand times.  <br /> <br />The Dance of Eternity is a great instrumental. Featuring a jaw dropping bass solo from John Myung, this song is just a sprawling instrumental showdown. <br /> <br />One Last Time follows, and is a good song. Good, emotional vocals from James LaBrie and a good instrumental backdrop, this song is cool.  <br /> <br />the Spirit Carries On is a ballad. Not my favorite on the album, but certainly a great song, and it includes Petrucci \\"soul shredding\\".  <br /> <br />Finally Free is the atmospheric conclusion to this album. Dream Theater closes this album with LaBrie singing \\"We'll meet again my friend... someday SOON!\\", the rest of the band playing the riff a few more times, and the final \\"scene\\" of this concept album.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|If you like this album check out Iron Maiden 'Death On The Road'<br /><br />& Iced Earth 'Alive In Athens'. Both kick butt and just as good!!!!!! Get 'em!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the concert in Melbourne on the second day of filming (haven't found myself on the DVD yet!). It was hands down the most awesome and amazing concert of all time, and this DVD easily does it justice. <br />Amazing shots, angles, timing, and quality show all the important elements of what was a simply mind blowing concert (so good in fact that I flew up to Brisbane to see it again!!!) <br />If you haven't got it - GET IT, and be sure to regret the fact that you missed the concert.
B000002H97|3.0|Thrash metal is supposed to be fast, complex, and have meaningful lyrics; something Metallica's self titled album doesn't quite have. <br /> <br />Compared to most other nu metal cds out their today, is this cd fast and complex? Yes. Compared to earlier efforts by Metallica? NO WAY! I found while playing these songs on my guitar the other day I had about half as much trouble playing as i did with, o say, Dyer's Eve from ...And Justice For All.  As for those saying the Black album is better than And Justice, in terms of thrash Justice is far superior. And come on Metallica, a ballad on your cd? Bullcrap! <br /> <br />As for lyrics, I don't know what Metallica was thinking. While the first song may be catchy, i mean, come on. The first time i listened to this song i thought it was a joke. Are they singing about the boogeyman? Did Metallica just say pillow!!!!? Metallica said the word pillow!  And the song Of Wolf and Man. Come on Metallica, singing about werewolfs? Metallica sang in this song about something they vowed never to sing about, and that was something mythical and unreal. In one of the members own words, in talking about Kill Em All; \\"we don't want to be like Iron Maiden or some of those other bands that sing about things that aren't real.\\" ect. Well Metallica, you lied.  <br /> <br />Despite being simpler music, the Black album still can be quite catchy on the first dozen listens, but unlike Kill Em' All thru ...And Justice For All, where the albums slowly grew on you until you loved them to death, the Black album does the opposite. It slowly but surely starts to get boring and repetitive until you don't feel like listening to it any more. This is definately not a classic or masterpiece. Just another cd soon to be lost in your collection.  To sum it up, I find my self listening to Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice for All quite often, but rarely do i ever listen to the Black album. <br /> <br />If you're new to Metallica i highly recommend listening to these songs (my favorites) first: Hit the Lights, 4 Horsemen, Fade To Black, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Creeping Death, Battery, Master of Puppets, Leper Messiah, Blackened, ...And Justice for All, and One.
B00078XGRO|5.0|There is a rule that many are familiar with: every even-numbered Star Trek rules. Many consider the 2nd film the Wrath of Khan to be the best, just like the 2nd Star Wars Empire Strikes Back the best(I'm going by release order here). First Contact then would be the Revenge of the Sith(or A New Hope, depending on your tastes) for Star Trek. <br /> <br />In Generations, you had the old cast passing the torch to the new one. Here we have Generations' cast first film by themselves and it's quite good. Previously in the series, Captain Picard got assimilated by the Borg, a race that turns others into them and are part of a collective. During a battle with a Borg cube, a getaway vehicle creates a time portal and assimilates Earth in the past, thus present-day Earth is all Borg. <br /> <br />So the Enterprise has to go back in time and stop the Borg. Only the Borg picked a peculiar date: the day before mankind makes first contact with an alien race which then kickstarts the science to make galaxy travel possible. The ship that starts first contact is damaged so the crew on Earth have to fix it by the next day. Not only that, the crew on the Enterprise have to deal with invading Borg, who are trying to signal other Borg for help. <br /> <br />What films like Alien and Star Wars brought to sci-fi was the idea of a used future. This meant things were broken down or barely working(I still get a laugh after Han Solo has to punch the Falcon to get it working in Empire). Star Trek on the other hand like 2001 looked to sterile, too neat. Generations suffered from this and even here when the ship gets overrun, it still looks too neat. Character-wise, it's showing signs of change like when Picard found out he was the last Picard in Generations or here when he deals with his Borg experience. <br /> <br />I'm not a Trekkie, in fact I haven't seen a single episode of the old show, even the one where Spock and Kirk fought or one from Generations. However, I still liked watching this film. Although it doesn't have as cool scenes as the Ribbon and stellar cartography in Generations it's still a good film nonetheless, and most likely your 2nd favorite Trek film.
0553801503|4.0|Like many of Martin's fans, I've been waiting for this book for what seems an eternity. I could hardly contain my excitement when I made my weekly visit to the author's website and saw the giant headline proclaiming, \\"It's Done!\\" But at the bottom of the page was a footnote that said \\"(sort of).\\" For those who may not be familiar with what happened here, Martin's manuscript simply became too large to publish in one volume, and so he decided to split it in two, with this book telling half the characters' stories, and the others' pushed back until A Dance With Dragons is done. So, does it work? Sort of. <br /> <br />Our main POV characters this time around are Samwell Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Arya and Sansa Stark, and Jamie and Cersei Lannister. Fans will note the absences right away: we still don't know what became of Bran, on a trek through the far north with the mysterious Coldhands; or what manner of troubles Jon Snow is having on the wall with Stannis and the wildlings; or where Tyrion has gotten himself to (though we can guess); or what Dany has been up to, far to the east.  <br /> <br />However, Martin has taken a bit of a different approach this time. In addition to the main characters, three minor characters have one chapter each, and three others have two each, titled with descriptions rather than the characters' proper names. We have The Prophet, The Captain of the Guards, The Soiled Knight, and so on. As such, this book branches out a bit more than its predecessors, and we get to spend some time in a few locations that we've seen little or nothing of thus far -- most notably, Dorne. There's been much speculation over what would happen there following the Red Viper's death in A Storm of Swords, and some of that is revealed in A Feast For Crows. <br /> <br />That said, the downside to this diversity is that few of the storylines make considerable forward progress. With Martin putting off half of his main characters until the next volume, one might expect that each character in this novel would advance more than usual, but in fact we get the opposite. Even when little is happening, Martin is still a strong enough writer that the book is always interesting, but while this certainly isn't a bad novel by any means, it's easily the weakest in the series. <br /> <br />As for the individual characters: Cersei's chapters are good; despite how monstrous the woman is, she is in King's Landing, at the heart of power and influence in Westeros, which means that interesting things are always happening. Jaime is equally interesting as his character continues to develop and change. Arya has always one of my favorite characters, second only to Tyrion, so I love every page of that, but there are precious few pages devoted to her, and her part of the story ends so abruptly that you'll be wondering whether a chapter was left out by mistake. Sansa herself has never interested me much, but with the master schemer Petyr Baelish close at hand, her chapters are never dull. Samwell is not a favorite of mine either, though there's still a few provocative moments to be experienced there. Brienne, however, achieves nothing except to take valuable pages away from better characters. <br /> <br />It's still Martin, which means it's still good, but I can't help feeling a little underwhelmed by this volume. It's well written and has its moments, but it seems to be building towards a climax that it never quite reaches. Since the events in A Dance With Dragons will presumably be taking place at the same time as those herein, my guess is that that book may very well suffer from a similar lack, but I'll be as quick to buy that one as I was to get this. I'm really looking forward to seeing what will happen thereafter. I just shudder to think how many years we'll have to wait...
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I'm a metal person, really. By which I mean a fan of everything from Iron Maiden to Vital Remains. So you probably realize why I would hate Avenged Sevenfold. You see, A7X is another one of those hardcore/metalcore/whatever bands masquerading as metal, and that irritates me to no end. <br /> <br />Well, at least, that's what I though of them after hearing Waking the Fallen. But then there came City of Evil. This is not hardcore, this is not metalcore. This is not anything -core. This is a terrific combination of traditional metal, thrash, and straight up hard rock that I would never in a million years have expected from the band that released the pure garbage that was Waking the Fallen. <br /> <br />The screaming is gone, which is a good thing. I do enjoy screaming, and growling even more, but M. Shadows' screams aren't too impressive. His clean singing, however, rocks pretty hard and is actually reminiscent of Axl Rose himself. <br /> <br />My only issue is that some of the choruses are a little bit punk-ish and sound almost too cheerful, but hey, the rest of it compensates. The guitarwork is top-notch, the structures are interesting, the songwriting is tight as a drum...good stuff all around. It's really amazing how good this CD is, and I still can't believe they pulled it off. <br /> <br />So, Avenged Sevenfold, I salute you.
B0009S4IHY|3.0|The official release here is 3 equivalent ($5.50?), but the eventual pirate release will be 1/3 of that (ahem). Money better spent, in my opinion - on other fare. Apart from the bemusement of seeing the local tenants somewhat incredulously thrash the hide off the baddies, and the recurring theme of the near-indestructible chain-smoking landlady, the film is just one lengthy fight-fest, a Chinese comic (literally) equivalent of a more violent Steven Seagal or JC van Damme brawl. Once you've seen one flying kick and wire-assisted swoop, you've seen them all. There are some nice CGEs and comic touches, but it's hardly belly-laugh territory.  Probably comes across better on the big screen than a small one, as the studio localised set becomes a bit restrictive, and tedious to view continuously, albeit with different lighting effects and slow-mo. Others have mentioned borrowings from other films, but I betcha Mr Chow saw \\"The Mask\\" at some stage beforehand. Conclusion: A cinema version of \\"having a Chinese\\", - reasonably tasty initially, but eventually unsatisfying, and not really worth going back for seconds either.
0307263118|5.0|Although I have only read three of John Banville's novels, I can understand why `The Sea' won the Man Booker Prize. The writing is both mystical and enlightening.  And the novel is aptly titled.  The first sentence refers to the day the gods departed on the strange tide and ends resonating the novel's first paragraph:  the essential strangeness and yet welcoming familiarity of the sea, which, during the course of the novel, becomes metaphor for life, death, yearning and love.   Max Mordan, beyond middle age, made sadly old by the long and painful death of his wife Anne, returns to the resort town of his childhood where he spent two weeks every summer with a father who would later desert them and a mother who could never forgive. Though not entirely clear, the seaside town seems to hover somewhere between England or Ireland. It is clannish self-serving and self-contained redolent with all vices of the fifties, sustained by prejudice:  a caste system in which the inhabitants are divided between renters and owners, and those, who like the Graces, stayed in hotels and those like Max, who didn't. But who instead shared three shabby rooms, a chemical toilet and paraffin stove.  Max and Anne both of them large, big-boned, and sensitive, have one thing in common -- each other. Looking back like a drowning man Max sees his life reel by and tells us that what sustained the marriage was the commitment they made their relationship that they could be anything they wanted.  While part of the novel deals with their relationship it also weaves in the relationship between the Grace twins:  Chloe and Myles. The two gods Max envied and so desperately wanted to emulate.    Years later, Max would return with his daughter Claire and a tearful scene concerning her own awkward relationships. Another time he would bring Anne. Therefore following her death is seems both natural and predictable that he would return. The Cedars rooming house as bereft and nondescript as ever but where Max hadfirst met Grace family. This is what Max wants. What he needs to remember, and in time, relive. The place he has never forgotten, where one summer long ago he became part of a tribal and sexual initiation that had ended in tragedy. And where, another young woman, much like Max had never quite belonged either.
7119005901|5.0|Regarding the four Classics of Chinese literature, there is a popular saying that goes: \\"lao bu kan san guo, shao bu kan shui hu\\", translated as: \\"The young shouldn't read Water Margin while the old shouldn't read The Three Kingdoms\\". I did just the reverse: as a teenager living in France I voraciously read Water Margins, that depicts the lives of 108 outlaws (I knew all of their names by heart!) and is supposed to have a negative influence on young boys because of its vivid display of violence and its apology for the overturn of the social order that made it a favorite of Chairman Mao. The Three Kingdoms was not available in French at that time. I discovered this second classic much later in a Japanese translation, at an age when readers allegedly shouldn't be exposed to its depiction of stratagum, deceptions, frauds and trickeries that cunning politicians could use to their advantage. My dream is that when I reach old age and become conversant enough in Chinese, I will be able to read The Three Kingdoms and Water Margins, as well as the other two classics of Chinese literature, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber, in their original versions.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|Most of what needs to be said about The National has been said in the other reviews. Their music is dark and deep, catchy, mournful, lovelorn, wise and strangely hopeful. There's a mystic reaching desire to it, a searching need for something redeeming, even messianic.  <br /> <br />Aren't all of us out \\"looking for astronauts?\\" <br /> <br />The music shares some of the lapidiary chamber-pop sensibility of The Arcade Fire, but certainly they also share this with Brooklyn bands like P.S and Searay.   And there's no need to classify them as \\"Canadian\\" because of such a cursory similarity.  <br /> <br />As something of an aside, I have to say that the constant desire of critics, even the Amazon reviewer on this very page, to classify bands (strangely only Indie Rock bands) according to geography so that a band's location or location of origin is supposed to dictate everything we need to know about them is very strange and, to be honest, not terribly useful. Especially in the age of the Internet. But, that being said, I can make a solid geographic case for them.   <br /> <br />The National shares plenty with, since these are the bands mentioned by the reviewer,  Interpol and the Yeah, Yeah, Yeah's. Rhythmlines to start with, both bass and drums, propulsive and staccato;  certainly Patti Smith and The Velvet Underground as immediate ancestors; lyrics with almost constant NYC geographic and thematic references and  a deep desire to cloak themselves in the outward trappings of what used to be the \\"Downtown\\" music scene (a scene now made up of bands almost exclusively living, practicing, and, in many cases, playing, in Brooklyn).  <br /> <br />When I say trappings, I mean the clothing they wear on stage, the art on Alligator's cover, and the sensibility of their lyrics which, as mentioned above, are steeped a perspective both dark and emotionally cool, sometimes cold, on the edge of callousness that is often associated with New York. Things that might seem peripheral to themusic, but informs everything about them.  <br /> <br />Play, in a row,  Interpol's song Evil, the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Maps and The National's Abel and the musical similarities aren't just obvious, they're striking.   <br /> <br />New York is famously a city of immigrants, the destination of peoples from all over the world who come here for the opportunities they see in America and, conversely, the destination of people from all over America who don't see opportunity in their own state or home town. Many of those people are artists, writers, photographers and musicians. <br /> <br />The National very comfortably fits into this tradition. They might have come here from Ohio. To the Amazon reviewer, they might sound Canadian, but to this Georgian who moved to Brooklyn and became a fan of an entire continuum of Brooklyn Bands that encompasses the alt-country rock fusion of the The Mendoza Line, the rock funk of TV on the Radio, the unabashedly happy pop-punk messianism of Palomar, the soaring Utopian longings of the already mentioned Searay, and the disconcertingly lonely defiance of Stellastarr, I'd say that The National most clearly belongs, if labeled geographically, nowhere so much as Brooklyn where they are the perfect soundtrack when it's late at night and you're in hipsterville headed up Metropolitan Avenue with Manhattan glittering behind you and you're walking against the wind just trying to get yourself home.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|This album has gotten some recent, if much delayed, buzz due to the the inclusion of \\"Breathe Me\\" on the second Six Feet Under soundtrack \\"Everything Ends\\" (thank you, Astralwerks, for yet another incredible compilation/production). If you saw the series finale of Six Feet Under, \\"Breathe Me\\" is the song in the very last scene when Claire leaves for NYC, a scene forever burned in the minds of every Six Feet Under fan.  Dear God, what beautiful and haunting song.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, I am happy to report this is NOT one of those CDs that you purchase only to find the song which spurred the purchase is the only song you would ever listen to.  This entire album is gem.  Sia's vocals, as could be expected, are on point.  While the other songs are not like \\"Breathe Me\\" in sound, they are just as equally effective.  Overall, I would describe this album as downtempto trip-hop, but with Sia's unique treatment.  It is beautifully varied and always delivers Sia's voice to your ears with a sly smile. <br /> <br />Give Sia a try.  She is so much more than \\"Breathe Me\\", though this song gives you a definite impression of her yet to be discovered genious.  I would also highly recommend her first solo album, \\"Healing is Difficult\\", which contains her other cult-favorite song \\"Blow It All Away\\".
B00005JNX0|2.0|Well this is no Shrek, Findidn Nemo oh wait it's not like most animated films oh wait it is better then Shark's Tale. I found this film to focus more to the younger ages and focuses to much on the naimation and the voces and not on the story. The movie is about Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer). David Schwimmer is the only thing good about the film, Jada Pinkett Smith seems lost and the rest are ok. Overall not that much jokes make the film slow and not intersesting.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|...and this DVD does a hell of a job capturing my own experience.   <br /> <br /> <br />Some other things that would have been cool to include: <br /> <br />U2 singing Unchained Melody <br />Not censoring Bono during Vertigo <br />More Dido (Thank You and White Flag) <br />More Keane <br />More Killers (although, they only sang one song - general complaint.) <br />A better angle for the workup to Floyd taking the stage <br /> <br /> <br />Some really cool things they could have included: <br /> <br />The *entire* audience in Hyde Park singing along to Bon Jovi's simulcast from Philly <br /> <br />Pink Floyd's soundcheck from the night before - Floyd fans - oh my god, that was amazing to hear.  We watched through tiny holes in the huge metal wall (fitting...) surrounding the field and a host of other people climbed trees to get a better view.  It was a full rehearsal with the video screens, lights, smoke the works.  All the workers dropped what they were doing and were watching Floyd.  It was awesome to hear that music rolling across a basically empty Hyde Park and looking at the smiles on everyone's face.   <br /> <br />They should have included some more video of the crowd before the show and maybe stuff from around London. <br /> <br />Interviews with the artists backstage would have broken up the jarring artist to artist transitions.   <br /> <br /> <br />In terms of video and sound quality - it's better than I expected.  I dont have surround, so I can't comment on that mix.  If it was up to me, they would have had a 12 disc set capturing every second of that day - but I understand this isn't practical.   <br /> <br />Buy, buy, buy this DVD!  Great cause and a great concert. <br /> <br />Note: I give it a 4 only because I'm comparing it to my experience.  Concert videos never really capture it...
0312335164|2.0|I read it en route from Johanesburg to San Francisco ... I kept reading with little other options on the 22 hour flight.  Wikipedia states that it was written in 1998 - and based on the computer science referred to, I think that early date is believeable.  It's just an average book and does not compare to Brown's later ones.
B00005JNQS|5.0|I can't believe there are SO many bad reviews here for this. Most seem to be annoyed that this children's movie isn't also geared to keep parents entertained as well. Well, boo-hoo. If you're looking for high-concept comedy, go watch Curb Your Enthusiasm after your kids go to bed. <br /> <br />My son adores this movie, loves the characters and is definitely not bothered by the fact that it's not going to win an Oscar for best screenplay. To the haters, I say 'lighten up.' To everyone else, I say buy this, watch it and enjoy an hour or so of cute robots, fast-paced action and clever visuals. <br /> <br />Honestly people. *eye roll*
B000002UTT|5.0|The lack of credit that Roxette gets really annoys me. Even though \\"Look Sharp!\\" sold over 8 million copies, they always seemed to be overshadowed by other pop artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson at the time. Now it seems like a lot of people have just forgotten about them in the US. Their last two CD's, \\"Have A Nice Day\\" and \\"Room Service\\" were amazing, but none of the American labels would even release it here! It's just sad and it p*sses me off. Ok, I'm done complaining.<br /><br />\\"Look Sharp!\\" and all of Roxette's other CD's, have some of the best pop music you'll ever here. Per Gessle's really catchy music and lyrics and Marie Fredriksson's incredible singing ability is just a killer combination. My favorites on this are \\"The Look,\\" \\"Dressed For Success,\\" \\"Cry,\\" \\"Chances,\\" \\"Dangerous,\\" and \\"Listen To Your Heart.\\" The rest of the songs are really good too. Highly recommended!!
B00008D1NF|5.0|I just happened to be in Brazil, for carnaval 2003, in Bahia, when this album was released. Anyone who's been to Salvador during Carnaval knows Axe is king. This album just captived the whole Carnaval, outshining Chiclete com Banana and Ivete Sangalo that year. It is an interesting album beacause of the collection of talent, Marisa Monte, a mainstream pop music superstar, Carlinhos Brown, of Timbalda (a Bahian Carnaval supergroup), Arnaldo Antunes of Titas, an avant-guard Paulista group.    I love this album. Interestingly, others seem to reveiw as upbeat and uplifting, when in fact most of the songs are about failed and lost love. The two most popular songs from the album are \\"uplifing\\", Velha Infancia and Ja Sei Namorar. Knowing very little Portugese, I feel the strength of the album are the vocals in spite of my limitations. Antunes haunting voice combined with Monte's harmonies, and Brown's arrangement and slick production make a beautiful and powerful ensemble.
B000066C6Z|2.0|As a lover of the Naked Guns, Hot Shots, and the like, I picked up this item hoping I would have little drops of urine trickle down my pant leg from laughing to hard.  Instead, vomit trickled all over my chest from this movie making me sick.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is really good at humiliating himself in this movie. I feel embarreesed for him just watching him dance around like a gay Elvis. The movie only made me laugh once, because the jokes are not that good. If you want a good time call Leslie Neilson.  He will always help you out when you need to chuckle.<br /><br />Final Review *********  -2,341 RamRods
0156027321|5.0|I was really surprised how much i liked this book. I had heard a lot of comments about the book that should have discouraged me from even starting the book but I'm really happy I didn't listen to them. I really enjoyed the book. I liked the way the author wrote about Pi's survival and his every day on the life boat. I did not find any single page boring or unnecessary. Even the descriptions of animals killing other animals were there to serve some purpose and didn't make me sick.<br /><br />I really think the book needs some good reviews because it is an interesting read.
0440418569|5.0|Well, there's one thing that I just have to say about this book: If you have ever doubted that you have a soul, read the Amber Spyglass. If you do read this, and don't cry, don't feel like you just want to scream, and if you don't feel the passion of what the characters are feeling... trust me, you don't have much of a soul. This book is so passionate, not just in the love form. Lyra's innocence, her love, her curiosity... it captivates everyone, or at least, it captivated me. And Will... possibly the greatest male character I've ever read about, his seriousness... it's such a contrast with Lyra's, it's amazing to read this book just to read about Will and Lyra. And theology of the book... I've read this book four times and I still don't completely understand everything, but Philip Pullman has created a masterpiece of theology and philosophy here... I got the sense that he was trying to portray God, the Authority, as a weak dictator, who may or may not have had the right ideas on how to rule the universe, but just wasn't powerful enough to rule. Instead, he grows weak and old and the Metatron, Enoch, becomes the new \\"God\\" and is on the verge of changing humanity forever, and not in a good way. I might have gotten that wrong, but when Lyra and Will helped the Authority out of his casket, or litter... I got that sense. There's so much in this book to analyze... I don't think anyone could ever completely understand what Pullman was trying to say exactly and completely... but he's a genius, that's for sure. This book was amazing, even better than the last two and I totally recommend it.
B000002IGV|5.0|One of the rare album in my huge collection that I can listen from the beginning till the end.  Don't be fooled by their silly, ugly drag-queen look.  This band can do very good music.  And the singer Dee Snider is an articulate and intelligent individual.<br /><br />The rest of the album is more loud and metal than their fruty greatest hits \\"I wanna Rock\\" and \\"When I'm gonna take it\\".  These two singles didn't represent the spirit of this great album.  Songs like \\"Street Justice\\" and \\"Captain Hoody\\" are sinister and \\"SMF\\" is a real kick in the ass.<br /><br />Forget about their look and buy this album.  This is another true heavy metal classic.<br /><br />Don't miss it!
0553801503|4.0|Edit:  I've gone back and re-read Feast, after being somewhat disappointed with it on the first reading. This is unusual; I generally don't re-read a book until a year or two has passed. I did with this one mainly because I'm such a fan of the first three and wanted to give it a second chance. I haven't been disappointed.    Yes, it's slow, probably even too slow; I still believe it would have been fine without some of the minor viewpoints. The first three books in the series often contained important plot being revealed through conversations and messages instead of POV's, but Martin seems to be shying away from that.  It's also subtle - the second and third times through, I realized some fairly important things were happening that I hadn't noticed the first time I read it. Personally, though, I think this is a good thing.  I also skipped some of the more graphic sex in my re-reads simply because it was unimportant and not nearly as interesting as what happened afterwards.    Most of all, though, these were relatively minor points. They're enough to put Feast below the 5-star rating I'd give the first three books, but even if it doesn't have my favorite flavoring I'm happy with Feast. More to the point, I think that when the time comes to re-read it again before the next books come out, I'll enjoy the experience.      (Original:)  The rest of the books have been excellent.  This one was decent - certainly readable and enjoyable, but a comparative hiccup in the series.  Presumably, it was necessary, and the later books will expand on things that happened in this one, but at the moment it seems like GRRM just stopped telling the story mid-sentence.  Most of the other books have had wrapped-up plot lines and cliffhangers; in this one, it mostly just stops.  That said, I'm buying at least Dance with Dragons and the next one before I give up on him.  We never have the problem that occurs in Jordan's writing of the novel seeming like a RPG, largely because nobody is becoming omnipotent.  There is a somewhat Jordan-like slow-down, but then GRRM mentioned that he had originally intended to make everything that happened in Feast and Dance simply happen between books and not really write either of them.  I'm looking forward to the one after Dance.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When I heard there was another Batman movie coming out I thought to my self, \\"Yes, another big flop on my favorite comic book and show.\\" I was dead wrong. Batman Begins has the action, and more importantly the plot development that movies lack nowadays. Unlike the Spiderman movie's happy happy joy joy feel with unrealistic happy outcomes to every event, Batman Begins has plot twists, deception, and is a more realistic movie in general. I'd have to say that the movie started out pretty quickly and for a second I thought they made Bruce Wayne an Asian man. This movie is probably for teens and adults versus younger kids, just because their is some \\"intense and scary\\" parts. I'd have to say this is perhaps one of the best \\"hero movies\\" and I highly recommend it.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I cannot begin to convey my anger now that I've learned that it was this LEGALLY PURCHASED cd which caused my computer to crash last week.  After spending nearly 5 hours on the phone with Dell India, no one there could figure out what was causing the blue screens every time I tried to start up.  They did not know what \\"aries.sys\\" (listed on the blue screen) was but pegged it as a newly-released  virus.  I was told that the only way to fix my system was to do a total reformat.  So we spent another 2 hours reloading Windows & drivers etc.  I lost half of my iTunes library but at least I won't be wasting another day re-ripping the other half of my cd collection (that wasn't on my iPod) onto my hard drive. Instead I am just going to download all the songs I want (and more) from Kazaa.  At least the spyware that Kazaa installs doesn't make your computer un-useable.  Great job, Sony.  After this fiasco you can be certain that I will never again buy one of your cd's.  I hope you get sued into bankruptcy court for installing trojan viruses on a million people's computers, it's exactly what you deserve.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory hit me very hot and cold. First, the look (which Burton excels) was very close to how I pictured it in my head when it was first read to me. The casting was absolutely flawless, especially the excellent acting of Freddie Highmore as Charlie--an asset to any movie. All the kids reflected the various deadly sins of pride, greed, arrogance and gluttony with great humor. <br />On the negative side, the extreme departures from the book were glaring. You can take license so far and then it becomes another Hollywood hack job. If Burton would have removed all the Oompa song and dances (which will date the film in a year) and added more book elements, he really would have had a movie. Willie never had issues with his parents, nor was he suppose to be so much in need of therapy. My wife and I previewed this movie and are not sure if it is appropriate for our kids. <br />I think Burton should have just come up with some other movie instead of using Willie Wonka and the Chocolate factory as a backdrop for something young kids really should not watch.
B0002OERI0|5.0|OK CLASSIC ROCK FANS, This is the best hard rock album of all <br />time. A lot of songs on this were really great. I loved the last <br />track Whatsername, really great rock and roll song. Definately <br />you have to repeat it over and over and over again. Definately <br />a great way to this album. Then I loved other songs like Holiday, <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams, St Jimmy, & Wake Me Up When September <br />Ends. Are We The Waiting, ok not one of their best. The title track was pretty good too, kinda got dumb lyrics in it. I didn't <br />really like She's A Rebel too much. Kinda punk rock song. Then <br />I didn't like the 10th track either. I'm not really crazy about <br />the 2 9-minute epics. The 9th track was ok, not their best. <br />I never really liked the other Green Day CDs, so in my opinion, <br />this is Green Day's only good album. This is definately what needs to be in your CD collection right now. Go out and buy <br />it today and listen to it like 3 times. GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!!!
B00005JMYI|3.0|Anchorman isn't much like the typical Hollywood comedy these days, but those who have seen enough of such comedies should realize that's definitely a good thing.  It's not quite a classic, but it's a silly, perverse, and occasionally surreal adult farce that effectively exploits the same formula that made Caddyshack a favorite among young guys everywhere: twisted characters, oddball dialogue, and a few lowbrow gags to keep everyone loose.  Even more importantly, it doesn't try too hard or wear out its welcome (having sat through Wedding Crashers in the theatre, I can attest that mainstream comedies shouldn't run past 100 minutes; this one clocks in at a highly palatable 90), and even the unrated DVD cut doesn't pile on gross-outs just because it can.  In other words, it's a lighthearted, funny, frequently inspired flick, which on its own makes Anchorman a success by the standards of the past few years.<br /><br />Set in late 1970's San Diego, Anchorman scores some major points with its comedic take on the rapid social changes of the time and the inhernet vacuity of the news anchor's job.  The cast is surprisingly good, led by a brilliantly over-the-top performance from Ferrell (whom I could normally take or leave) in the lead role of Ron Burgundy and the constant scene-stealing of the great Steve Carrell as dim-witted weatherman Brick Tamland.  There are plenty of mock-serious poses to go around, and some hysterical physical comedy led by Ferrell's bizarre turn playing jazz flute (check out those flames!).  Hell, Ron Burgundy's mustache is a great running joke in and of itself.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to have many aspirations beyond just being really goofy, but to be fair, it accomplishes that task extremely well most of the time.  Anchorman is at its best in its first half, when it revels in the excesses and political incorrectness of late '70's and pokes fun at them at the same time.  Not to mention, it's a goldline for memorable lines (in fact, Bill Simmons, aka the Sports Guy of [...] fame, used quotes from this movie for this year's NFL preview).  Here's a sampling of some of the classic lines from the first half-hour alone, not counting a few that I can't repeat:<br /><br />\\"Years later, a doctor will tell me I have an IQ of 48 and I'm what some people call mentally retarded.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm very important...I have many leatherbound books...my apartment smells of mahogany...I'm friends with Merlin Olsen.\\"<br /><br />\\"I could be wrong, but I believe diversity's an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is anchor MAN, not anchor LADY, and that's a scientific fact.\\"<br /><br />\\"I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and NEVER CALL HER AGAIN!\\"<br /><br />\\"You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter...you're so wise...you're like a miniature Buddha with hair.\\"<br /><br />\\"I have very little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately (even though I sort of saw it coming) Anchorman does lose a bit of steam after the halfway mark, although there are still some great bits of slapstick to be found: Jack Black's dog-punting cameo (an instantly memorable scene if ever there was one); the five-news team brawl, and the knock-down-drag-out fight between Ron and Veronica Corningstone chief among them.  Still, Anchorman manages to generate plenty of laughs and goodwill in its brief running time.  It's certainly not as nuanced and intelligent as, say, Sideways, but then I don't think it's supposed to be.  What it is supposed to be is a nice little piece of goofballery, which it very much winds up being.e Sports Guy of [...] fame, used quotes from this movie for this year's NFL preview).

B000056VJ7|5.0|Yes this album came out even before I was born, but it still is one of my favorites.  I have always loved Steinman's work, and I think he is one of today's truly gifted and talented musicians/songwriters.  I grew up more with Bat Out Of Hell II, and \\"I Would Do Anything For Love\\", and that stuff is really good, but this is the Meatloaf album to own.  The thing that I love about Steinman is the way that he puts so much effort and emotion into every song he writes.  None are just thrown together.  Every part is crafted and molded to musical perfection, not to mention that he writes such clever lyrics.  \\"For Crying Out Loud\\" is not only my favorite song on the album, but one of my top 10 favorite songs of all time.  There's no point in going on and on about the songs, most everyone has heard everything off this album at one point or another whether you wanted to or not, but this is probably the best work Steinman has ever done.  I don't see how anyone can't like this album, it's a classic and one that definately belongs in your collection.
0446577383|5.0|With the Camel Club, David Baldacci returns to his old form as one of the premier adventure novelists.  In his more recent  novels, Baldacci was in a rut--his plots were all too predictable.  His current best seller is like his earlier novels; the plot and cast of characters are truly unique.     Sure, the ultimate outcome is known (the good guys win), but Baldacci craftily leads to a conclusion that keeps the reader guessing until the very end. <br /> <br />The truly unique feature of this book (at least compared with other Baldacci books) is that it contains a thoughtful analysis of the current U.S. administration's foreign policy.   Baldacci comes down squarely at  odds  with the administration's policy that led to the war in Iraq.    And, in an all too realistic scenario of a near nuclear global annihilation, he paints a picture that has escaped mainstream media and is more insightful than most \\"professional\\" political analyses. <br /> <br />This is much more than an adventure novel.  It is a thoughtful portrayal of a failed foreign policy wrapped inside a delightful yarn <br />
0739308653|1.0|Antidotal stories, personal opinions, and somewhat painful to listen too.  It was a great premise, but the delivery isn't very good.  I wish I had saved my money and not purchased this book
0767020308|5.0|It is even better than the one with Gwinneth Palthrow. <br />Wonderful story, of course, wonderful settings, wonderful actors. <br />For the fan of Jane Austen's !
0553801503|4.0|First of all, I have got to say this book will be a very decent read IF it was published in less then a year after 'A storm of swords', but making readers wait FIVE YEARS for this is just sickening. Yes, Martin is still a creative genius with all his 'grey' characters and no real version of good or evil, but he seemed to mess up in 'a feast' just in some areas. The IronBorn and Dornishmen are very very interesting POV'S, too bad that there are only around three chapters for each. Asha deserved more chapters and so did the events in Dorne. Second off, Martin in my personal opinion made a HUGE mistake giving POV'S to Brienne and Sansa. He also made Cersei's POV way too long. No one give a damn about the Tarth Maid's sad stories of getting picked on cause she's uglier then Hell and Sansa's court intrigues are just a meeker version of Cersei's court intrigues. Cersei have way too many POV'S and most of them are just repeitive. YES MARTIN WE GET IT, Cersei is losing her mind, fine NEXT. Third of all, this story just moves way to slow to comprehend. It's like the whole book accomplished nothing except for a few more dead characters,(Yes the dying of the little Rose is quite a suprise, i was expecting him to get a POV first before he perish) The dying of the other kingsguard had no effect whatsoever on anything simply because there was a total of maybe 12 pages written on him. By this book's end we should have seen at least one major battle involving the Dornishmen and the Ironborn should have at least met with the Boltons or something. Overall, this book was a decent read simply because Martin has ensnared fans with his previous three. 'A dance with dragons' is almost certainly to be better.  I really wish Sansa will just die along with Brienne and that fat pig Samwell so we get no more POV'S from these three. George Martin should know that as 'politically intriguing' as he's trying to get, bottom line is that he's still a FANTASY writer, so warriors and swords still should come first. He gave us readers morsels of newly introduced great fighters such as the Darkstar of Dorne, Andrik the Unsmiling and Qaul the Maid. He should have three new POVS right there. I even planned out the deaths of Sansa, Samwell and Brienne. Sansa should just fall off a cliff, Sam should die of a heart attack since he's eating anything that's made of atoms, and Brienne should just sponatelous combust.
0385486804|3.0|I loved this story and the book was fairly well written, but Krakauer beats certain things to death, such as how 'great' of a young man Chris Mcandless was. <br />Maybe there just wasn't enough material here for a full book? Whatever the case, do we really need to keep reading, many times over, about how he and his sister Carine were so close? <br />This is but one of many examples. <br />We get the point. <br />Aside from a few interesting pieces, I didn't learn much more from this book than I did from Krakauer's original Outside magazine article, which can be found online. <br />McAndless' story is a great and tragic one, but this book could have used some stronger editing. By page 100 it starts becoming redundant. <br />My suggestion is go to the library and pick this up, it's a quick read. Don't buy it. <br />Krakauer's Into Thin Air is a stronger effort.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|This is a 'must hear' album! I agree with the previous reviewers that say that Marillion has put out some albums prior to this jewel that were still good just not great ... I was elated to listen to this album and have since been able to also obtain the two disc version. Songs I think stand out 'Fantastic Place', 'you're gone' (yes upbeat (compared to the more darker songs on this album, kinda out of place but still an excellent tune), and from the double album the epic 'ocean cloud' is a treat. I just love this band and I suggest everybody to get out there and 'discover a lost art, play marbles'
B000929AJQ|2.0|This seems an attempt to regain lost popularity, from ambitious though boring conceptual one man efforts.   <br /> <br />NIN started out as bouncy gothic disco, and this is the best part of this album. <br /> <br />Only fits this bill, the best track.  It could have been made by NIN in 1995, or The The in 1985- the lyrics are even straight from Soul Mining. <br /> <br />It sounds more like a band than a man in a studio, and this is good.  Broken and some other cuts always sounded stagnant from the studio, whereas live versions or studio performances were better (a video Broken is the band in a one take, much better than the album track).
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Their sound has not changed though the world has in the 4 years since their last release.  The political messages are singularly focused on anti-War, anti-establishment.  The songwriting is good, but not as good as Toxicity their zenith. <br /> <br />Toxicity is probably the best hard rock album of the 2000s.  It is hard to believe it and U2s All That You Wnated are PRE-9/11 as both seemed to sum up something in the air so well, just the opposite feelings.  Maybe these artists tapped into an unrest present before it even occurred, like an instinctual foreshadowing. <br /> <br />I mention this, because the anti-war rhetoric here is pretty stagnant.   <br /> <br />It does also not help a song when the lyrics are political epiphanies from high school dropouts.  Its just as bad as listening to Warren Beatty or Kurt Russel talk politics.   <br /> <br />Its like asking your dog how to fix the remote control.   <br /> <br />There blathering will influence millions of 15 year olds none the less.   Who probably wont enlist.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|I like her previous albums except one of her songs in this album Unplugged, Unbreakable because she didn't use her voice in the whole song and she strained herself on the high notes. I prefer her to sing in low notes because it suits her and makes the whole song soulful. But overall, she's doing good. :)
0684824906|5.0|There are excellent reasons why Doris Kearns Goodwin is considered one of America's most eminent historians. This book illustrates them with excellent clarity.<br /><br />Delving beyond one-dimensional pop-culture portrayals of Abraham Lincoln, she produces research substantiating the case that Lincoln got where he did because he had also been a wheeler-dealer. Beneath a 'rough' country exterior was a person with incredibly shrewd political instincts. Lincoln understood that he needed to cut deals with people, particularly powerful figures who were considered his own enemies, if he wanted to remain in politics and excel. Lincoln believed that people worked best together in many cases as opposed to being apart.<br /><br />This book is not a simple biography, but a complex study of leadership and policy up to and during the Lincoln administration. During his presidency, Lincoln issued executive orders suspending habeas corpus, imprisoned opposing government officials, and ordered the arrest of a number of publishers. These presented presidential actions uncomfortably co-exist with Lincoln as a great figure of freedom, but they also make the 16th president more human to me and other modern reader audiences.<br /><br />In addition to a portrait of Lincoln's leadership style, this book also examines the key political players, paying attention to how they interacted with each other. I liked William Henry Seward (Lincoln's Secretary of State from New York), just because he and Lincoln genuinely seemed to get along the best on the issues which really mattered, but found Salmon P. Chase's (Secretary of the Treasury and Chief Justice of the Lincoln Supreme Court from Ohio) presidential posturing frustrating specifically because he was not the president. Having workplace cohesiveness is a constant important.<br /><br />By making all three one-time rivals members of his own cabinet, Lincoln effectively managed a difference of political opinion to his own benefit. While reading Goodwin's expansive but wholly accessible volume, I thought how far America has come if today this practice is called 'slick'.olly accessible volume, I thought how far America has come if today this practice is called 'slick'.

B00007ELEL|5.0|I don't remember any trailers or anything for this movie back in 1998 when it first came out, but lately, I can't go a week without seeing/hearing some sort of reference to the film.  This film has, very deservingly, achieved a kind of cult status that very few films get.  While there are plenty of cult films out there, many of them appeal to a certain group of people, but, as my roommate said, no one dislikes this film. <br />In what is probably on a short list of comedy films with a (somewhat plausible) detective plot, Jeff \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a man content to just drift through life getting stoned, drinking white russians, and bowling.  That is until two thugs come to his house demanding money that he owes.  The beat him and urinate on his rug, which \\"really tied the room together\\".  Upon realization that he isn't the millionaire Jeff Lebowski that they're looking for they leave the Dude's house.  Egged on by his friend and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), who is a psychotic Vietnam vet, the Dude goes to the house of the other Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston) to ask him to recompensate him for his rug.  When the Big Lebowski tells him to beat it, the Dude encounters Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), the Big Lebowski's young trophy wife. <br />A few days later, the Dude is contacted by the Big Lebowski, and learns that Bunny has been kidnapped, and they believe that the same thugs who ruined the Dude's rug took her.  In exchange for being the courrier, the Big Lebowski promises to give the Dude $20,000.  What unfolds from there is one of the most insane detective stories I've ever seen, involving the Big Lebowski's artistic daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), a nihilistic porn star (Peter Stormare), and Hugh Hefner-esque porn king Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara).  Also, there is a bowling subplot, which involves Walter and the Dude's teammate Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Jesus Quintana (John Turturro). <br />It's weird, there are so many thingsabout this movie that might turn people off to it, yet I don't know anyone who's has seen it and disliked it.  It is extremely funny, a little edgy, and it has a very well-done plot.  All of the actors are very good in their roles, though Goodman and Buscemi deserve a little extra praise for their chemistry, seeing as how Buscemi's Donny only serves to be the whipping boy to Goodman's Walter.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie that will make you laugh and think.
B00005JO1S|3.0|Zathura propels the audience and two squabbling siblings into deep space while playing a mysterious board game. The live-action film is based on Chris Van Allsburg's 2002 follow-up to his award-winning Jumanji. Brothers Danny and Walter's combative relationship is established immediately along with a four-letter word, which is more jarring given the young age of the film's target audience. Zathura is rated PG, but considering the overall family tone of the film, the line is awkward at best. Tim Robbins plays the inefficient dad who appears only long enough to leave Danny and Walter in the problematic care of the sleeping older sister.  After this not-entirely, unnecessary, initial exposition the movie is remarkably fast-paced leaving little need to think too hard about the physics or lackthereof. One cool effect is followed another as the brothers take their turns to make matters worse, one card after the next, just like Jumanji and its movie adaptation.  And like Jumanji there is an adult who shows up in the form of an astronaut, played by Dax Shephard, to help end the game before the house is entirely wrecked by the barrage of black holes and bad robots. The astronauts presence, not only gives the parents a character to connect too, but creates a much more interesting dynamic between the brothers. The game itself is nicely sci-fi retro, as are the sci-fi scenarios, the art direction and the music.<br /><br />A mostly harmless family film which looks as pretty as Chris Van Allsburg's artwork (too bad he didn't add color to HIS Zathura).<br /><br /> Watch for the \\"Citizen Kane\\" homage in the alien ship.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|I never imagined that anyone could successfully satirize a subject as scary and gruesome such as nuclear war and destruction.  While it isn't as prevalent as it was during the Cold War, the threat still exists, and it is a scary one.  And yet, Stanley Kubric's Dr. Strangelove is a perfectly good example of a satirical look at such a subject. <br />Filmed in black and white, the movie chronicles a few hours in the worst day in human history.  A high-ranking United States general, General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden), has recently gone insane with rage, paranoia, and fear of the Soviets.  He has decided to execute an order reserved for sneak attacks; basically, in the event of a surprise attack on Washington, D.C., it allows someone besides the president to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.  He quarantines the entire base, making everyone believe that they are under attack, and the only person who sees through the madness is his executive officer, British officer Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers). <br />Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley (Sellers) has called a conference of top US generals, including Gen. Bucky Turgidson (George C. Scott), Russian ambassador Sadesky (Peter Bull), and German nuclear expert Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again).  While at the conference in an underground War Room, the president learns about the improbability of being able to call back the fighters, as well as the existence of a Russian doomsday device that cannot be shut down. <br />While the president desperately attempts to call back the planes on their way to Russia, circumstances in the air make things even more complicated, one of which being that the pilot of one of the planes, Major T.J. \\"King\\" Kong (Slim Pickens) is extremely gung-ho about the mission. <br />Many different aspects of the film are wonderfully used to satirize the situation.  From character names such as Kissov, \\"Bat\\" Guano, \\"King\\" Kong, Turgidson, and Strangelove, to the hilarious dialogue that has become some of the most famous lines that everyone knows, but doesn't know the origin.  Some of the famous lines include, \\"You can't fight in here!  This is the war room!\\".  Even some of the situations are priceless, such as the one involving Mandrake and the Coke machine. <br />It truly is amazing how brilliant this movie is.  Never before have I laughed so hard at a subject that sends chills down my spine.  The whole film was very well executed, and is definitely worth a viewing.
B0001LJC2K|3.0|The songs on this cd do not know when to quit with the pounding guitars, piano and whinning singer. People have said this band is a Radiohead clone but they are louder then radiohead but that does not make them good. Another singer this singer reminds me of is Jeff Buckley. All of the more rocking songs on this sound the same and the balads most of the time i cant even understand what the singer is saying. It is best to listen to this in small dozes not becasue it is very loud becasue the cd does not know when to give up. Another thing why cant this band lighten up everything is about the end and world and such. One more thing the signer needs to take some singing lessons and i do not mean listening to radiohead and jeff buckley as much as i like those two they have there flaws.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|Well this is fun, a bit like watching some former football stars do a benefit, and everyone's a lot more polite to one another than they used to be.  Cream fans might say Clapton's work on here is a bit banal. Funny thing is, when we first heard Crossroads live, some of us said what's that lame d7 chord doing in the intro, but here its absence is missed. Maybe what sounds lame one day is a classic tomorrow. I don't know if this is good or bad, since you can fool me. But you can't fool the blues.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is the movie you must see. The reason it failed at the box office I do not know, but when I first saw this movie, i was truly moved by its engrossing storyline. Its magnificant use special effects. I could not find one element of the film that I did not enjoy. You don't like the fact that the christian crusaders were heartless murderers? THATS WHAT THEY DID! They murdered thousands of muslims during those dark times. You do not believe me? research this topic online, read a book on the crusades. or watch the history channel. ALl of the things the christians did really happened in the movie. The names(all but Balian) were real!. NOT FAKE. And yes Gi De Lusenyon'(pardon if i spelled it wrong) did lead an army of 17k christians with his buddy Reynold and was massacred. But besides me correcting all of you non-historians. This movie was a masterpeice and must be seen. 5 stars hands down.

0553801503|1.0|I loved the first three books and think they are the finest trilogy ever written. I was very excited to read this fourth novel and bought it on a business trip. Wow. What a let-down. This book stunk to high heaven. Nothing happens; there is no action. I read the first 400 pages thinking surely SOMETHING exciting will occur. But no...nothing. I can't believe the author published this piece of crud and sullied his name. I recommend you skip this one. SAVE your money...borrow it from a friend - I have a low priced one for you...
B000A7S4B0|1.0|I was looking forward to listening to this disc. I had it in my hands shortly after it was released and I was going to buy it until I read on the packaging that it was \\"Content/Copy-Protected.\\"  At that point I put it back in the rack. I refuse to buy discs that compromise my fair use of the music that I'm paying for. <br /> <br />Amazon dropped the ball here by not pointing out that this disc is \\"Content/Copy-Protected.\\"  They only have noted that it's an \\"Enhanced\\" disc. Right! If you consider malware an \\"enhancement,\\" I guess it's \\"enhanced.\\"  If I had purchased this from Amazon I would have returned it as soon as I received it and found that it  <br />had DRM software - malware, really - on it. <br /> <br />RCA's DRM has cost BRMC and a retailer my purchase of this disc. <br />I'm sure that I won't be the only person not to buy it because of this. I hope someone wakes up and realizes that sales are being lost because of DRM. I hate penalizing artists and retailers because of this garbage, but I'm not going to play along with the RIAA stealing my fair use of music I buy. The RIAA and the MPAA are a bunch of modern day Luddites in my opinion. They refuse to change their outmoded business model. Hopefully, they will go the way of the original Luddites if they continue to attack their own customers. <br /> <br />The one-star rating here has nothing to do with the music on the disc. I never got to hear the disc. This rating is for RCA's treatment of its artists and customers.
B00005JO1G|1.0|After viewing this horrid piece of trash, I'd agree with the following from a wonderful soldier, Sergeant Jeff Davids, 1983-1987: <br /> <br />The \\"Jarhead\\" movie is a disgraceful attack on the dignity and honor of all current and former Marines. The movie does not paint any positive qualities about the U.S. Marines. It selectively amplifies the negative actions of a few, at the expense of the whole. This movie will undoubtedly have an extremely negative effect on recruiting efforts.  <br /> <br />The overall theme of the movie paints enlisted infantry Marines as morally depraved people who quickly degrade into insanity, infighting and completely lacking in honor as Desert Shield progresses into Desert Storm. Individual scenes are exceptionally offensive to Marines and civilians alike. Examples of scenes portrayed in the movie include the following:  <br /> <br />Forced hot branding / burning flesh of fellow Marines in the barracks. A platoon simulating group sex with one another in the field. \\"Friendly fire\\" bombs lighting a live Marine on fire as he climbs out of a truck. A Marine wife mails a video tape of having sex with their neighbor, and the entire platoon enjoys viewing it. Decline of an entire platoon into insanity during combat operations. One Marine threatening to kill another at point blank range with a loaded M16 in an insane rage, and then turning the weapon on himself and asking to be killed. One loyal Staff Sergeant is portrayed as having irrational love for his service. Excessive use of the \\"F\\" word. Excessive portrayal of sexual obsessions. No respect whatsoever for fellow Marines.  <br /> <br />While U.S. citizens have welcomed Desert Storm veterans with open arms, this movie is Hollywood's way of spitting in their face. Please boycott this movie, tell others to boycott it, and I welcome your comments and suggestions about how to restore and uphold the honor of the U.S. Marines.  <br /> <br />From the halls of Montezuma To the shores of Tripoli' ,We fight our country's battles In the air', on land, and sea. First to fight for right and freedom , And to keep our honor clean, We are proud to claim the title of United States Marines.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AP04NI|4.0|Twelve years after its Broadway premiere this successful musical received a cinematic adaptation.  This is a musical that was considered in 1943, as the original invention for the modern stage musical, which has reached infamy and still reaches a large audience throughout the world.  The story takes place on the 1890's prairies of Oklahoma where life was tough, but love still found a way to root.<br /><br />Through the cornfields of Oklahoma the audience arrives to the vast widths of the Oklahoman prairie, as the camera moves into position in the opening scene.  A man gallops on his horse into the picture, as the title screen fades in and out.  All of this is accompanied by the Richard Rogers Overture, Main Titles, as it lands the audience on the farm where most of the story takes place.  It has a little of a whimsical mood for a western where most of these films have a struggling theme.  Nonetheless, it begins to dazzle the audience with the fitting song Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin'.<br /><br />The story in itself is a rather simplistic narration, which has similarities with Red Garters (1954) that was released the year before.  It intermingles a number of musical performances with a various dance numbers.  Occasionally, these dance performances come across as pretend fights, but it is a much better way of facing a rival than with a six-shooter.  The music and dance continues to astound the audience, as it elevates the story to a more dream-like mood instead of the heavy testosterone atmosphere that surrounds cowboys.<br /><br />The film opens with the cowboy and cattle driver Curly McLain (Gordon MacRae) who tries to woo Laurey (Shirley Jones) in a somewhat childish manner (by teasing and acting indifferent.)  In addition, Curly is from a man's world where the tough need-nobody attitude seeps through into his tender ego, as it does to those with this self-imposed toughness.  However, he courts Laurey in Miss Aunt Eller's (Charlotte Greenwood) presence, as he is a gentleman too.  The courting opens with initial verbal tease that leads to the song The Surrey With the Fringe On Top performed by the flirting duo and later they will reunite in People Will Say We're in Love.<br /><br />The love story is not without trouble from an external source, as Jud (Rod Steiger) too tries to pursue Laurey.  However, Jud's lack of personality and frightful presence intimidates her, and drives her off.  This fear of Jud enters Laurey's mind, which through a Freudian entry haunts her dreams.  The infamous dance choreographer Agnes DeMille presents her nightmare in a bizarre dance piece, which seems a little out of place.  Yet, it shines with brilliance.  However, the jealousy and vengeance that fill Jud's mind and heart will eventually lead to a crime of passion.<br /><br />There are also a number of subplots such as Will Parker (Gene Nelson) returning from Kansas City (also a song Nelson sings in the film) with the fifty dollars he needs in order to marry Ado Annie Carnes (Gloria Grahame).  However, to his heartache he learns that Annie has been seeing the flirtatious salesman Ali Hakim (Eddie Albert).  This triangle drama contrasts the conflicting love story between Laurey, Curly and Jud, as this is more of a sideshow with strong comic undertones.  Many scenes are full of amusing lines such as when Ali makes the comment, \\"I wanted to marry her when I saw the moonlight shining on the barrel of her father's shotgun.\\"<br /><br />Oklahoma! captures the sheer size of the prairie in the film by shooting the film simultaneously in two different systems Todd-AO and CinemaScope, which helps transcend this musical to a delightful cinematic journey.  Unfortunately many scenes are static due to the cumbersome management of the sizeable camera equipment.  On occasions, the film feels a little too fluffy, and the acting too staged.  Yet, the film provides a warm and whimsical love story drenched in dance and song.<br /><br />IMAGE NOTES:<br /><br />Fifty years ago when they shot Oklahoma! they used two different cameras simultaneously: CinemaScope (2:55.1) and Todd-AO (2:20:1).  Fox has been kind to the audience by letting them see both versions, but back in the day the Todd-AO with its 70mm had a sharper and better image.  However, on this DVD the CinemaScope version appears far superior in regards to quality of clarity, sharpness, and specks.  The CinemaScope version can be found on disc one while the second disc has a fussy and, at times, a lot of digital issues on the Todd-AO version.  Yet, it is nice to be able to see these two versions and compare them, and fortunately the audience does not have to see the horrendous televised pan and scan version./>Fifty years ago when they shot Oklahoma! they used two different cameras simultaneously: CinemaScope (2:55.1) and Todd-AO (2:20:1).

B000AP04MO|5.0|In Stanley Donen's 1967 film Two for the Road, the audience will learn about the difficult journey of a marriage.  To capture a decade, or more, of a legally tied relationship in two hours might be exceptionally difficult, as there might be several different moments that deserve the attention.  However, Donen cleverly approaches the conceptual idea of marriage problems through the Oscar nominated script by Frederic Raphael, as the married couple portrayed by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney sets off on vacation to the French Riviera.<br /><br />The film opens with Joanna (Audrey Hepburn) and Marc (Albert Finney) getting stuck in a wedding ceremony, as a couple of newlyweds enter a car.  In this scene, Joanna points out the negative aspect of the newlyweds by stating, \\"They don't look very happy.\\" To which Marc dryly responds, \\"Why should they? They just got married.\\", as he suggestively points out the problems of his own marriage with Joanna.  Yet, they seem to have it all; an expensive Mercedes that they can afford to bring on their flights while enjoying all the luxuries of life.  Nonetheless, these two cannot seem to find a way to concoct happiness within their marriage, as they continue their preoccupation with their unhappiness.<br /><br />Spiteful words and comments lash out from both Joanna and Marc, as the acts and expressions of love are far and distant apart.  They are flying to southern France where they have gone on vacation numerous times before while they both know everything there is about one another. They have acquired knowledge about each other over time and during their many trips together.  This time they have a seat open in-between suggesting the significant rift between them.  However, it was not always so, they once were darlings that struggled keeping their hands of one another.<br /><br />Through the inspirational storytelling technique that Raphael illustrates in his script, he brings a juxtaposition of several vacations from stretching from their first encounter, their second camping road trip, and the third vacation with friends.  There is also a vacation where they bring their daughter and the current vacation where they are flying and driving with their white Mercedes.  Each trip to the south brings a different vehicle, maybe representing some symbolical notion, but further discussion of the matter will not take place here.  However, the many vacations bring the audience on an affectionate journey to what created the icy and aloof atmosphere that lingers around Joanna and Marc.<br /><br />Two for the Road is presents an emotional drama with moments of terrific humor that fits the character of the film.  Occasionally the humor seems a little repetitive, but it is also quick and witty with much sarcasm.  Some of the recurring jokes might suggest a little why they are unhappy, as they both seem bored with each other.  Nonetheless, the film displays touching affection and sharp bitterness through the main characters' relationship.  Compatibility issues surface, as Joanna and Marc constantly seems to be at each other's throats.  Then there are the endearing moments that unite them, which brings out the human ambiguity in the story through the emotional rollercoaster of insecurities, trust issues, and passionate love.  It is an ingenious bobbing and weaving of emotions, as they ferociously throw vicious words at one another that ends up in passionate make up sessions where they tenderly express their zealousness.  Yet, it also offers the audience an opportunity to ponder the reasons why married people stay married, and why they can sit in each other's company without uttering a word.<br /><br />Two for the Road is an interesting film, as it provides dual feelings.  Occasionally, it brings the strong motions of tender feelings, yet then there are the moments when the film feels emotionally painful, as it might be close to heart for many married couples; including me.  It is within this emotional turmoilwhere the film finds its strength and cinematic value, as it will have the audience feel, think, and feel some more.l turmoil where the film finds its strength and cinematic value, as it will have the audience feel, think, and feel some more.
B00000163G|5.0|When Tupac was shot I had no idea who he was. I may or may not have heard his music in a club someplace. What bothered me was what did he have to say that would make someone want to shoot him. Before I heard this CD I was strickly R&B guy. I had no interest in Rap or Hip-Hop. So I go out and buy Eyez and listened to it day and night. Truely outstanding. It reminded me of where I came from and showed me where I was headed. I had my job, my house, car, my 2.3 kids and really didn't care what was going on in the rest of the world. When he passed, I went and bought every Pac CD, movie, and book I could find. I became a fan. A fan not only of Pac but of Hip-Hop itself. Tupac taught me through his music that there is a lot more going on in this world, all you have to do is open your eyes and see. For that I thank him and will never let his legacy die. They say death is a state of being where one exist only in the hearts of others, and Pac will always live in mine. I still listen to R&B from time to time, but if you see a 40 something guy in his whip bumpin some classic Hip-Hop it could very well be me.
B000B6CODO|4.0|The rhythmical thumping of exotic drums awakens innocent curiosity and a desire for adventure.  As the drumming intensifies in both volume and beat, inquisitiveness strengthens together with a slowly escalating heartbeat.  The combination gives a heightened level of attentiveness and physical alertness presents an opportunity of tense anticipation within the individual.  However, the personal eagerness for suspense could reaches a point beyond personal safety and comfort where fear begins to affect the individual.  Jumanji's rhythmical pounding helps tap on the idea of adventure, suspense, and fear through the naïve consciousness of children, which delivers a fantastic adventure that enters a magical realm of the perilous mystery.<br /><br />A twirling green glowing fog shapes the letters Jumanji while a swooshing sound slashes through a distant howling opens the film.  Consequently, the camera fades into a dark forest somewhere in the New England region where an adolescent and his younger brother swiftly move with purpose through the foggy night.  The year is 1869 and the brothers are about to bury a padlocked strongbox in a remote location with the intention of securing the world from its content.  In the dark hours of the secretive burial, horses twitchingly move while remote cries of wolves amplify the horror of the moment.  Yet, the two children persist to submerge the chest within the earth, as a frightful hammering on drums seems to be coming from within the box.  At the final stage of the entombment of the chest, the younger brother wonders what would happen if someone would find it.  Fearfully the older brother utters the words, \\"May God have mercy on his soul.\\"  The suspense can undoubtedly escape the audience's attention in this brief opening.<br /><br />One hundred years later, in the idyllic town of Brantford the young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds himself in a fearful situation with a group of bullying kids.  His father too busy to listen, as he runs a successful shoe factory, demands that Alan faces his fears.  Without the fatherly safety, Alan finds himself alone and abandoned, and thuggish kids are outside waiting for him.  He has no other choice than face the beating. Afterwards, anger and sadness drift through him, but something catches his attention.  A distant rhythmical drumming is coming from a construction site close by his father's factory where he unearths the strongbox that the two boys buried a hundred years earlier.  Inside the box, Alan finds another box with the inscription Jumanji, which turns out to be a board game.  After additional arguments with his father, Alan opens the game with his friend Sarah, but to their dismay they realize that the game has a very real and dangerous secret.  Again, suspenseful anticipation seems to grow within the audience.<br /><br />Twenty-six years later, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) move into the mansion where Alan once lived with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), as they have recently lost their parents in an accident.  Both Judy and Peter struggle with several issues at the same time such as their bereavement of their parents, the relocation, and having to live with their aunt.  Yet, they have no idea what other struggles are awaiting for them when they too begin to hear the outlandish drumming coming from the attic.  Nonetheless, Judy and Peter open Jumanji and unlock its secret by a simple roll of the dies.  Here the film truly begins its rapid fall, after a slow climb on the roller coaster, which will swiftly throw the audience around in an amusing and suspenseful adventure.<br /><br />Now the question is whether Jumanji upholds the quality after the initial twenty minutes.  However, asking this in the review for Jumanji automatically suggests that the film falters, and Robin Williams has not even entered the story yet.  Not that Williams' performance is bad. On the contrary, his acting actually elevates the quality of the film, asit makes use of a heavy dose of CGI graphics and special effects.  The storyline is a little thin and the film feels too much like a video game where the heroes try to avoid monsters and creatures in order to stay alive.  At times, the film sends out vibes similar to the cheat mode of invincibility turned on in a video game, which ultimately reveals the notion of a successful conclusion.  Despite the flaws of the film, it offers a remarkable swift roller coaster that undoubtedly will keep many viewers attention through its flashy special effects and thrilling amusement.lm, as it makes use of a heavy dose of CGI graphics and special effects.

B000001FS3|5.0|The  Joshua  Tree  is  U2's  spiritual  masterpiece.  This  is  the  album  where  the  hungry  boys  from  Dublin  became  true  adults  not  only  in  their  age, but  also  in  their  music.  After  redefining  their  sound  on  The  Unforgettable  Fire, U2  mastered  their  new  style  and  created  this  beautiful  and  emotional  work  of  art.  At  this  point, Bono  had  still  maintained  his  love  for  poetic  lyrics, so, like  with  The  Unforgettable  Fire, the  majority  of  the  songs  more  closely  resemble  poems.  <br /> <br />  Now  on  to  the  songs  themselves.  The  first  song, \\"Where  the  Streets  Have  No  Name,\\" features  one  of  if  not  the  most  beautiful  guitar  intros  I've  ever  heard.  As  with  many  of  their  songs, the  song  reveals  the  influence  of  Christianity  on  the  band  and  provides  a  song  that  especially  moves  me.  \\"I  Still  Haven't  Found  What  I'm  Looking  For,\\" is  probably  my  favorite  on  here.  Again, U2  gives  us  a  very  emotional  song  with  a  message  that  many  of  us  can  relate  to. Of  all  the  songs  on  here, I  believe  this  one  truly  grasps  the  overall  theme  of  the  album  with  the  greatest  efficiency.  The  next  and  probably  most  famous  song, \\"With  or  Without  You,\\" is, again, a  truly  beautiful U2  masterpiece. The  climax  at  the  end  features  some  of  Bono's  best  vocals  of  all  time  and  the  Edge's  conclusion  is  enough  to  send  shivers  down  your  spine. \\"Bullet  the  Blue  Sky\\" is  the  song  that  really  stands  out  on  this  cd.  Unlike  the  others, it  provides  a  more  rock n'roll  kind  of  tune  rather  than  a  spiritual  one. Fortunately, in  this  case  it  does  not  matter. It  is  still  a  very  good  and  interesting  song  which  shows  U2's  diversity  in  their  sound. \\"Running  to  Stand  Still\\" is  probably  the  most  poetic  song  on  the  album.  Like  the  others, it  is  very  moving, and  I  love  thelittle  hermonica  solo  Bono  does  at  the  end. \\"Red  Hill  Mining  Town\\" is  the  most  cinematic  song  here. The  song  clearly  paints  a  picture  of  a  poor  town  and  the  feelings  of  its  citizens. Bono's  vocals  and  the  Edge's  subtle  guitar  provide  the  listener  with  a  truly  emotional  experience. \\"In  God's  Country\\"  is  another  display  of  brillance  by  the  Edge. Again, poetic  and  emotional. \\"Trip  Through  Your  Wires\\" has  a  very  different  pace  from  the  previous  songs  and  provides  a  feet tapping  rhythem. Bono  again  gets  to  show  off  his  hermonica  skills. Kinda  makes  you  wonder  he  doesn't  play  it  more  often. \\"One  Tree  Hill\\"  is  probably  the  most  underated  song  on  here.  It  is  an  emotional  song  that  describes  the  loss  of  a  close  friend  and  features  the  best  of  Bono's  vocals.  Since  this  song  is  so  beautiful  and  so  favorably  reviewed, I  find  it  surprising  that  it  was  only  used  on  The  Joshua  Tree  tour. \\"Exit\\" is  probably  my  least  favorite  on  the  cd. However, it  is  still  a  very  good  song.  It  just  has  too  long  of  a  silence  in  the  middle  of  the  song  and  not  enough  of  the  Edge  to  satisfy  me.  The  closing  song,\\"Mothers  of  the  Disappeared, is  also  one  of  my  favorites. It  is  a  song  that  can  make  you  cry  and  is  again  cinematic, poetic, and  emotional. The  repetition  of  \\"we  hear  their  heartbeat\\"  is  very  simple  but  touching  at  the  same  time.  This  is  the  perfect  way  to  close  a  perfect  album. <br /> <br />   I  wish  I  could  say  that  the  following  albums  were  as  good  as  this. Rattle  and  Hum  and  Achtung  Baby  came  close, but  this  remains  U2's  pinnacle  and  best-selling  album  ever.  I  recommend  this  album  to  anyone  who  has  any  descent  taste  in  music  whatsoever.  It  is  certainly  a  favorite  of  mine. <br /> <br />Overview: <br /> <br />The  Great <br /> <br />Where  the  Streets  Have  No  Name <br />I  Still  Haven't  Found  What  I'm  Looking  For <br />With  or  Without  You <br />Bullet  the  Blue  Sky <br />Running  to  Stand  Still <br />Red  Hill  Mining  Town <br />In  God's  Country <br />Trip  Through  Your  Wires <br />One  Tree  Hill <br />Mothers  of  the  Disappeared <br /> <br />The  Good <br /> <br />Exit

0679720200|5.0|The stranger is more of an epic describing Camus \\"absurd\\" man. It goes through his mind, transcends his soul and at last introduces us to his wavering thoughts.<br /><br />Mersuault is a depressed existentialist who sees no meaning in anything around him, however he believes that there can be something interesting about every minute thing that can make you happly-or at least not sadly- go through every single moment. He possesses the same qualities; the same approach that Camus describes in his philosphical essay about the mythical figure Sisyphus.<br /><br />Mersault is condemned by people who don't know him because of his carelessness. He reminds them of their predominant dark sides and their weakness and inability to face the truth. His friends and acquintances look upon him as a mere person who managed to get along with them fine because of his passiveness and indifference. He yields to all their requests. He doesn't counter-argue. He is more of a friendly intelligent pet. The main theme of the novel, however, stems from Mersault's view of himself. He doesn't understand anything whether relating to him or to the world around him. He is a stranger in his own eyes who moves as a stranger between people unaware of anything except for his existence and insignificance.<br /><br />At the end of the story, just before his execution, Mersault realizes that he has no other opportunities in this life he didn't live trying to understand. He wants to embrace his last moments by becoming worth of anything, even if it was people's hatred or disgust.<br /><br />The stranger is one of the most intriguing novels that artistically describes an existentialist and confused mental state.
1402545355|5.0|I love listening to Ms. Lecat's beautiful reading of these books. And Alexander McCall Smith reminds me of Trollope in his ability to convey human foibles and the subtlest shades of human relationships -- often by what he leaves out as well as what he includes. The cadences of the African accents, so perfectly rendered, sing in my head all day.  (Lecat comes closest to perfection of any non-American I've ever heard when she imitates an American, so I assume her other imitations are at least as fine.) A real joy!
B00005JO1G|1.0|In 1987, Time magazine ran an infamous cover that consisted of a marine in his dress blue uniform-with a blackened eye upon his face. The cover was intended to depict the shame befallen the marines after the Clayton Lonetree spy scandal and it was met with outrage-how dare Time sucker-punch the entire Marine Corps because of the crimes of just one of its members? Yet after seeing the movie \\"Jarhead,\\" Anthony Swofford's autobiographical account of the marines during the first Gulf War, a black eye is the least of the marines' problems.  <br /> <br />The fundamental theme of Jarhead's portrayal of marine life is that heroes do not exist. One cannot depict the Marine Corps accurately without noting that at least some of its members perform feats of strength, endurance and bravery, and that to build an entire institution of such men, certain virtues are required. Yet like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, a movie acclaimed for its supposed depiction of Viet Nam-era marines, none of these men and certainly none of these virtues are to be found.  <br /> <br />Instead, what one finds in Jarhead are empty men who drift though life, denied of what they truly want, and who choose to make up for it in emotional outbursts and sadistic and debased pleasures. Again and again, this is what Hollywood sees when it looks at the marines. <br /> <br />Yet as far as I can tell, there's no massive backlash by marines against this movie-in fact, I'm amazed at the positive reaction many marines have had. Are these marines so starved for heroes-so hungered for a portrait of their lives in uniform that they will find merit with those who portray the character of their commitment as utterly bereft of meaning or purpose, simply because the actors put on a marine blouse or use a jargon that rings familiar? <br /> <br />I served five years in the Marine Corps during the time Jarhead was set and I can certainly recount stories, both humorous and horrific. But overall, if I had to characterizemy and my fellow marines' service, it would be the honorable commitment to the betterment of one's self and the defense of the American nation. The men I worked with might not have talked about it everyday. There might have been the occasional breach of conduct or character, and some may have even failed miserably in achieving the standard of excellence that is the hallmark of the corps <br /> <br />Yet overall, (and in the metaphysically significant sense-the only sense that matters in art) almost every marine I knew was in the corps for a purpose and that purpose was good, noble, and just.  <br /> <br />That's why I, for one, was proud to wear the marine uniform, and that's what no Hollywood movie that I know of has ever been able to accurately capture in a film about the marines. Given the freedoms the marines have fought so valiantly over their history to preserve, it's a tragedy they haven't received better from Hollywood in return.

In this CD, she branches out to showcase her range of style and her versatality as a songwriter, vocalist and musician.   <br />This is one of those rare CDs where every song is a beautiful work of musical artistry.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|I have taken my time before writing this review and   it  most certainly was fillied with endeles replays  of   this CD. At first  I have  considered  this to be  somewhere between  3 and 4  stars, but   have discovered   the  depths  on    the songs on this  record. <br />I am not gonna  go into  disecting each song,   but    this album   I would describe  as  a combination of \\"Violator\\" and  \\"Songs of faith and devotion\\".  Let's  just  say that  Depeche mode  do not have a match in their style. The combination of  electronica, guitar and sometimes  string combined with religiously motivated lirics has never been  produced on  such  large scale. No one has ever been able  to do  such music and  become a  world phenomenon. Lat week  I have also atended their  \\"Touring the Angel\\" concert  and must say that Depeche mode has not lost anything. They were as entertaining  as they were  at  each and every of their tours in the past.  Dave Gahan is a   great entertainer who  knows how to  bring the crowd  to boil.  There are many     a  reasons   for which Depeche Mode  has sustained their faithfull following.  We all  have   at least one.   This album  is most definitely one of their best. Their  are again at the top of their game.

What this almagam of crap is, is neither one thing or the other and makes no sense whatsover. Adrian Paul was good in the TV series, but this Dude ain't Lambert. lambert was always the Highlander, and the tv show just a distraction in between movies. <br />One word in a nutshell \\"crap\\" give this movie amiss, if you like the Highlander.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I gotta admit, I picked this up based simply on how much I liked \\"Feel Good Inc\\". The rest....not as catchy, but close. The first few tracks are good, but it gets really good with \\"Dirty Harry\\". It's another single-worthy song with a nice choir. I also love \\"Dare\\" with the singer from Happy Mondays, and \\"Fire Coming out Of A Monkeys Head\\", narrated by Dennis Hopper. \\"Don't get Lost In Heaven\\" would be alot better if it was more than two minutes long, but it does kind of run into the final cut \\"Demon Days\\". \\"EL Manana\\" I dig too. As a whole the album might not be as hook-filled as \\"Feel Good Inc\\", but it will make you feel good.

This film was about as compelling as a movie could be, in my opinion.<br /><br />The actors all do a fine job and the story is haunting. At first I thought it would be kind of funny, as the mother of a newborn, to watch a movie about a man who can't sleep, but Christian Bale puts a whole new spin on the concept of being tired.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|FINALLY!!!  I am so pleased to see the Collector's set has been released.  I wanted so much to purchase the individual releases of each season, but my husband (the smart man that he is) kept saying that he was confident that a collector's set would be released and wa-la, he was right!!  I saw it in Best Buy yesterday, and took a good look at it, it was $5.00 more expensive so I checked it out here on Amazon.com, and YESSSSSSSSS it's here, and a for a few dollars less. Thank God that I have been a good girl this year, because Santa has checked his list and found that I was nice and not naughty this year.  I can hardly wait until Christmas morning!!!  What an inpowering series for women of all ages.  I just love these women and their ups and downs and ins and outs of life in the city!
B0009X7664|4.0|Just the basics here.  We all know this is one of the finest films to ever be produced. I don't need to go over that. Just about everything worked. Wonderful book by Harper Lee, strong adaptation by Horton Foote, perfect casting, starting with Gregory Peck, understated directing by Pakula, mesmerising music by Elmer Bernstein.<br /><br />The film itself never looked or sounded better than on this DVD. I have not tried some of the other releases to compare.  But the extras are just minimum.  The conversation with Gregory Peck? It is more of a home movie than an interview. You see him talk about his work for a total of less than 10 minutes. The rest of the time you see him with a lot of other people (presumably his family but the credits do not say), eating figs, just hanging out. I was hoping to hear him talk about his role and what he thought it meant.  Anyone else in the film?  Forget about them. Scout is the only other person involved that you see, and that was a wonderful extra.  You see Foote for maybe a minute and the great Elmer Bernstein for a total of 30 seconds.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood, this is one of the best films ever made, you can give us more than this.  We get more extras than this for any Batman or Halloween picture.<br /><br />If I had it to do over, I would probably just hang on to my VHS and wait until somebody did this right.<br /><br />Or if they released this DVD at less than a premium price. As it is now, they are pricing for extras that do not exist.
0380789035|3.0|I had heard some great things about this book and was expecting something spectacular when I picked it up.  What I got was a novel with an interesting premise, a great begining and an extremely mediocre middle section which bogged the book down.  By the time I got to the end, I was pleaseanltly surprised by the finale even though it was telegraphed midway through the story.<br /><br />Gaiman's America and his main character are the highlights of this book.  The gods that walk the earth are horrifying, quirky, sad and humorous all at once.  There is a cleverness to their depth and the mortality that helps save some of the other flaws of the novel.  The main character of Shadow is a simple man with a good heart.  He is the catalsyt for everything that happens around him and most readers will root for him and feel his plight.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the book is that it gets bogged down.  The whole middle section of the book kills a great start and I found myself struggling to get through to the end.  The characters jsut go from one place to another, meeting more people but it's all written in an uninteresting way.  It's hard to review a book when half of it is good and half of it is bad.  I think the final execution and pacing needed some work but the last 80 pages saves this from becoming a stinker.<br /><br />It's interesting to note how many awards this book took home.  The Hugo, Nebula, Locus, Stoker and Geffen.  Rarely has a book been so highly honored at this one and I'm shocked to say the least.  The Hugo Award winners are generally sci-fi/fantasy books that really have that extra something and often allow them to transcend the genre.  Just looking at 2002 alone this book couldn't hold a candle to Perdido Street Station and is about as good as The Curse of Chailon (both Hugo award finalists).<br /><br />I haven't read any other Gaiman and I wouldn't go out of my way since Im not a fan of graphic novels.  Saying that, this book is worth a read if the plot interets you and you enjoy novels that are focused around road trips...<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Good but could of been so much better with a more fluid and interesting middle section.ad if the plot interets you and you enjoy novels that are focused around road trips... <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  Good but could of been so much better with a more fluid and interesting middle section.
078324228X|5.0|In the movie DISCLOSURE, with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore (based on the Michael Crichton screenplay), a high-powered, very ambitious and sexually potent woman sexually harasses Michael Douglas in a software company. The resulting chaos this causes in his personal and professional life forces him to accept the irony of his circumstance--him, a man, being harassed by a superior woman--and take her to court, or in this case, arbitration, to save his job. So much controversy was engendered by the plot of this movie and its relationship to the serious issue of sexual harassment (then a fairly new one) that most people ranting on either side about DISCLOSURE's true social significance forgot the actual plot of the movie, and as such, missed its real message: Demi Moore's character was brought to the software company Douglas' character worked for for the sole purpose of getting rid of him in the first place, such that a pretty immoral and essentially illegal business transaction could go through, making the principal stockholders rich. The movie actually begins where the famous sexual harassment subplot ends. Like ERIN BROKOVICH or WALL STREET, DISCLOSURE was not about sex and power, but really a window to the architecture and life-destroying immorality of corporate greed in its entirety.<br /><br />I was slightly put off by some of the publicity surrounding the treatment of the subject matter that is the life of boxer Reuben Carter before this movie came out years ago. But I am still perplexed to the point of amused as to why everyone still rants about every aspect of the film's subject matter but not the actual film itself. Just as people still talk about DISCLOSURE as a sexual harassment irony movie, missing the actual point Michael Crichton was making about the business world, dissenting reviewers have missed the fact that it was a rival movie company's publicity staff who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to see to it that all this historical controversy would make it to the news in time to prevent this movie from winning the many Oscars it probably would have won, without the stink surrounding it. The Oscars have so much money at stake for the studios that could win one for their movie they are almost as political as Washington, D.C.  It wasn't the Smithsonian or Cornel West or Mike Wallace or CNN that broke this story, *it was the corporate greed of Hollywood, Inc. itself, doing so as part of a ruthless and pretty immoral business deal against a competing movie studio*. The very debate of Reuben Carter's actual historicity is as much a symbolically absurd morality play on the corporate greed of Hollywood (and the prevailing ignorance of our culture) as the plot of the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />This whole topic warrants mentioning only because it is, to this day, the secret architect of the opinions Norman Jewison's treatment of Hurricane Carter --above and beyond the overall message and artistic brilliance of the film as a whole--that is reflected in so many people's opinion of the film.  History itself, if we're going to be honest, is a form of elitist narcisstic mythology more often than not (see the work of Howard Zinn [A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES], Noam Chomsky [UNDERSTANDING POWER], Edward Said [ORIENTALISM], Edward Hermann [THE TERRORIST INDUSTRY], Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed [WAR ON FREEDOM], Gore Vidal [BURR; LINCOLN; PERPETUAL WAR], et. al).  The degree to which ALL history is a lie can be debated until the Exedrin is passed around like cocaine at a suburban garden party; it has little to no bearing on the mythic structure and relevant artistry of great filmmaking--striking at the heart of the actual purpose of history in the first place.<br /><br />Regarding the possible racist unconscious underlying Hurricane Carter's quasi-historical portrayal: by the same token, virtually every movie made in Hollywood before 1978 and God knows how many afterwards, from BIRTH OF A NATION to GONE WITH THE WIND to DRIVING MISS DAISY to FRIDAY AFTER NEXT and beyond, shows the African-American community in such an absurdly one-dimensional and offensively inaccurate light that if we commented only on the historical/social inaccuracies inherent in the depicted subject matter we'd never know what the art form of film actually consists of, let alone what represents it well. MISSISSIPPI BURNING (1988), for example, so enraged Chaney's  family members (of the Shwerner, Goodman and Chaney civil rights activists) that they held many a lecture in many a college regarding its blatant historical inaccuracies; historical inaccuracies obviously designed to whitewash history such that the film would be more palatable to the dominant culture of the Reagan Era 80s (as subtle racist apologia usually attracts liberal white audience for civil rights films and did so quite well during his administration). Yet no one, however, not even them, argued that Gene Hackman and Willem Defoe weren't incredible in it, and probably deserved Oscars nominations for their portrayals.<br /><br />What made me see THE HURRICANE is why everyone should see it. Minor flaws notwithstanding (in construction, not research), director Norman Jewison creates a completely magnificent film. And the incomparable Denzel Washington gives what is undoubtedly the greatest performance of his career. From the very first moment the screen is filled with an image of Denzel as the boxer, you have no choice but to believe him and believe in him. Even the downright eerie way Washington completely became Malcolm X in Spike Lee's masterpiece is SURPASSED by the degree to which he took on and magnified the soul of Rueben Carter. I've seen most of Marlon Brando's work; I've seen James Dean's; I've seen the best of de Niro. I have never seen acting like this before, ever.  The Oscar given to Denzel for his essentially phoned-in performance in TRAINING DAY a year later was as a \\"Sorry we screwed you over THE HURRICANE\\" Oscar.<br /><br />See this film and believe in the nobility of the human spirit again.F A NATION to GONE WITH THE WIND to DRIVING MISS DAISY to FRIDAY AFTER NEXT and beyond, shows the African-American community in such an absurdly one-dimensional and offensively inaccurate light that if we commented only on the historical/social inaccuracies inherent in the depicted subject matter we'd never know what the art form of film actually consists of, let alone what represents it well.

They never failed the rock fans with their infectious rock music from Generation X to Generation Y, from the unsurpassed style of rock vocals in each track courtesy of Steven Tyler to the ass kickin' riffs of Joe Perry.  <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, Aerosmith is here to stay. <br /> <br />The album contains 15 tracks which is a collection of songs from the Geffen archive.

0553801503|3.0|The first three books set themselves up on a pedestal high above all other epic fantasies. I have come to associate GRRM with quality and an experience worthy of skipping work for. If you haven't read his books before, you definitely should. <br /> <br />Unfortunately this book fails to meet my expectations. In fact, it reminds a bit about the 4th-6th book of Robert Jordan's A wheel of Time Series. I feel as if certain parts of the book were there as filler, rather than as something to propel the story properly. Of course, GRRM shines in various chapters in the book, but I have to say that he has always shined in the previous three. <br /> <br />The book is still stands up well on its own, but I refuse to give this book a rating of 5 just because the other books were great. We need to properly rate THIS book accordingly if we want to let GRRM know what his fans want, rather than uselessly being fanboys without providing properly feedback on an specific basis.  <br /> <br />Others have already pointed out what the problem is, and I'll restate it here. Editing. It really does feel like GRRM is now going the Robert Jordan route. I'll stick with the series for now, but I've got my fingers crossed.
B00006B1HH|4.0|Let's face it: The 1950's were the most boring time in America (besides the 40's).  It was all about conformity - from the cookie-cutter suburban monstrosities called houses to the goofy clothing, to the music (I have more respect for Buddy Holly, who wrote his own music, as opposed to Elvis Presley) and toeing the right-wing line.  It was a decade when discrimination ran rampant against anyone not white or male (or who didn't fit into and buy the so-called \\"American Dream\\") and careers continued to be ruined by the witch-hunts of so-called \\"reds.\\"<br /><br />But . . .<br /><br />I actually enjoyed \\"Grease\\" when I sat down to really watch and digest it.  John Travolta's time on Broadway with this show really paid off in the lead role.  He simply took it and ran with it.  No other actor could take his place as Danny (although didn't he ever get tired of playing the stereotypical dumb Italian guy - even though he's only half-Italian?).  Olivia Newtown-John was tailor-made for her role as Sandy.  She is one of a handful of singers who could actually act.  She was super cute.<br /><br />The DVD extras were informative and added to the good-time feel of the movie.  Apparently, the cast and crew got along so well that, for many of the cast, it really felt like their senior year in high school.  That chemistry came through in the movie and is still apparent nearly 30 years later.<br /><br />I can actually say I enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack.  It's just one of those movies you can never tire of after watching many times.  There is no logical explanation as to why there was a sequel.
0553801503|5.0|howdy howdy, <br /> <br />i was a little surprised Martin picked up right after he left off, but clearly he means to complete the action in the books in a relatively short time frame (a few years in his world, max). <br /> <br />Brilliant writing, as always, and even without my favourite characters very much worth the read.  He brings in the other houses and characters that he had always alluded to, not to string things out, but to tie things together into a well conceived plot on the 7 kingdoms. <br /> <br />Having read it, here's some predictions: <br /> <br />1)  Jaime's the \\"valonqar\\" of Cersei's prophecy, not Tyrion! <br />2)  Theon's totally not dead <br />3) the one you all know, jon snow is a targaeryon, and one of the dragon's three heads.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Since 1995, Opeth has established an unmistakably unique blend of death metal, '70s-influenced progressive rock, and folk music. This album is a relaxed, confident marriage of Opeth's heavy and mellow sides. Singer Mikael Akerfeldt's clean voice is smoother than ever, but his death growl is still bowel-loosening. The songwriting is incredibly fluid. Songs regularly top 10 minutes in length, but never feel long. Even the heaviest songs are full of contrasts. The rhythm section has a '70s-esque sense of swing that gives the album a human, organic feel. New keyboardist Per Wiberg is the band's secret weapon, his piano, organ, and mellotron giving the album a lush, spooky atmosphere. If this album were a drink, it would be a hot toddy.
B000002B1M|5.0|1. Intro <br /> <br />2. The Message - (5/5) - Whoa deep song. Great  <br /> <br />3. Street Dreams - (4.5/5) - Pretty good song about the streets <br /> <br />4.

Lauryn Hill) - (5/5) - Great way to end the CD
B000B19BCG|5.0|When one listens to Mansize Rooster and then Fin off the new album it is truly difficult to believe that the same band wrote and recorded both songs.  To say that Supergrass have matured as a band with their unique sound is an understatement.  Standout tracks for me are the last two.  An essential album. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|When it comes to classic rock albums, there aren't many that can outshine Abbey Road.  An apex in musical achievement.  I had heard many of the hit songs off this album before, but in order to the get full effect you have to hear the entire album from start to finish.  You just hafta!  The first time I heard 'She's So Heavy' I had something between a religious experience and a nervous breakdown.  Of course, I may have been dosed up at the time, but so were The Beatles.  This album is definitely a North Star in drug culture.  It was a grand, final effort put forward by one of the most influencial bands of all time.  The songs have a vibe of composed madness and melancholy topped with a silly genius which casts a spell like only The Beatles can.  This is nothing less than 5 star, legandary material, hands down.  If you're a music fan, and especially if you're a musician, and you haven't heard this album yet, find a way.  This album is as essential to music as the sun is to life.  And that's all I have to say about that.
B00001U0DP|5.0|If there was an infinity symbol for number of stars I would have chosen it. This is quite possibly the greatest film of all time. No other movie can make you laugh and cry quite like \\"La Vita &eacute; Bella\\" can. . . and it's done in such an unlikely arena for what could actually be considered a comedy. When I say comedy I mean a real comedy, and a real movie, not Anchorman-style. When it comes down to it I guess Italian cinema is just that much better than that of the Americans. When you watch this movie, make sure to watch it in its original Italian. Use subtitles if you'd like, but something is lost when it's dubbed in English.
B00003CX5P|4.0|<br />  In this episode of freaks and follies,it is still a pretty good action packed film for those who are star wars junkies. It has a really good pod racing scene on tatooine with little Anakin skywalker showing off his already peaking jedi skills. Master Qui-Gon Jinn was one of my favourite characters  <br />in the film with his outstanding skills and knowledge of the force. I also thought that some of the funnier characters like the junk-dealer Watto and the cheating Sebulba made this movie even more enjoyable. Palpatine's rise to power slowly starts to take place also. A good entertainment flick.....\\"May the force stay with this one.\\"  Way to go George!!!
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Tim Burton may be a visionary genius but he isn't a renaissance man. He should have had more collaborators.    The first Willy Wonka is a work of great originality and beauty with music and presentation that is warm and hopeful.  Burton's feels a like a clunky model of a film.  For example, the grandfather lacked warmth.. Depp's Wonka is a bit creepy despite his considerable charm, and the film's tribute to imaginative childhood delight feels muted and unfocused.    The film does have Burton's dreamlike aura of fable which is always enjoyable, but it seemed to lack impact and direction.  The weird little Oompa-Loompas were curious, but unlike in 1972 they weren't wise or all-knowing. Here nobody is especially wise - Wonka is an eccentric oddball.. so instead of a delivery of wisdom from Wonka to Charlie it's really the opposite, with Charlie giving direction to a drifting and immature Wonka.    Charlie Bucket again shines as someone who makes the humanist choice for his family over a potential sellout for wealth, but it's less clear than the sublot in the older version.    Moreover since Charlie was noble at the beginning of the film already, his virtue was never in question, and without Charlie's inner struggle and transformation the movie really had less to say.  Willy Wonka transforms instead.  He loves his father and reconnects to his family..that's nice..  It's a different theme for a different film.  It may be more true to Dahl's book, but I prefer the other version.    Oh well. Hopefully the older film will be adapted to make a run on Broadway and Burton will recognize his limitations and let others carry the ball for his next project.      It's worth noting: Little Veruca Salt will soon be a child star.

B00004Z459|5.0|When Linkin Park first came onto the scene, I shyed away simply because they were another rock and pop act with excessive radio and MTV overplay. A friend of mine bought had the CD the car, and always played it, and somehow this grew on me. Call it what you want, but Linkin Park just works. I believe that they are in no way like Limp Biskis nor should they be compared. LP blended hiphop/electronica/and rock and roll together into a great musical form. The vocalist do a great job switching back and forth, and the album never grows tired. Thats why I add it to my DID list (desert island disc) list. ENJOY

0920668364|5.0|We first read this book several years ago.  My sister in law bought it at a book fair where she was teaching. It parallels my mother-in-laws last days with my husband.  It brought tears to our eyes.  Our youngest daughter, who was in elementary school at the time, bought it for us.  We read it to her and our grandkids. We were misty eyed with every reading.  Now that our youngest daughter is having her first child, we are buying for her.  It is a very moving and poignant story about a mother's love for her child.  I suppose that it can be taken as somewhat obesessive on the mother's love, but I think that the author is using artistic license to make the point of the just how intense that love is.
B000001DV2|2.0|With their classic albums \\"Pyromania\\" (1983) and \\"Hysteria,\\" (1987) Def Leppard proved to be one of the 1980s premier rock bands.  They created and epitomized 80s pop-metal and drew countless imitators. They were really, THE definitive band of the 1980s pop-metal genre. In the early 90s, before the rise of grunge, demand was high for a new Def Leppard album. But as the mighty Def Leppard got started on their new album, tragedy struck the band. One night in early 1991, guitarist Steve Clarke mixed alcohol with painkillers, with fatal results.<br /><br />There is a clich&eacute; that says when Steve Clarke died, Def Leppard died with him. Listening to any post-Clarke Def Leppard album makes this painfully clear. Clarke was by far the most talented member of the band. An underrated guitar player, he was also the bands best songwriter, churning out some of the catchiest songs of the 80s. His loss was a death blow to the band. Without him Def Leppard has limped on ever since.<br /><br />1992 saw the release of the first post-Clarke album \\"Adrenalize.\\" While recording the album, rather than replace Clarke, the band opted to continue as a quartet (guitarist Vivian Campbell would later join the band). Not surprisingly, the albums best songs were co-written by Clarke.<br /><br />\\"Adrenalize\\" certainly has the style and feel of \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria,\\" but the album sounds weak. Def Leppard's signature sound is in place; catchy hooks, and melodic sing-along chorus; but it just doesn't fly. The album is just too pop-savvy and assessable for its own good. The bands once metallic edge has been filed down to nothing. The band is like a neutered pit-bull with no teeth. \\"Adrenalize\\" is just cheese, pure 80s sounding, generic, hair-metal cheese. \\"Adrenalize\\" makes Warrant's \\"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich\\" (1989) sound like Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" (1986) by comparison.<br /><br />The band sounds good; it's just that the songs are weak. Had Clarke not died, and had he co-written the songs and played on the album, it probably would have been a good CD. Try as he might, guitarist Phil Collen just can't match the intensity of the Willis/Clarke duel assault that made Def Leppard's first three albums so good.<br /><br />\\"Adrenalize\\" opens with its big hit \\"Let's get Rocked,\\" which could possibly be the worst song the band has ever recorded. Not only is the music weak, but the lyrics are just soooo bad. For example:<br /><br />\\"Got a million ways to make my day<br />But daddy don't agree<br />'Cos when I try to get away<br />He says he got plans for me<br />\\"Get your butt right out of bed\\"<br />Stop buggin' me<br />\\"Get up and move your sleepy head\\"<br />Don't shake my tree<br />He said \\"Mow the lawn\\" - who me?<br />\\"Walk the dog\\" - not my style, man!<br />\\"Take out the trash\\" - no way!<br />\\"Tidy your room\\" - c'mon get real!<br />Sorry dad, gotta disappear<br />Let's get the rock out of here\\"<br /><br />Keep in mind that Joe Eliot was well into his 30s when he was singing about his dad telling him to \\"get your butt right out of bed\\" and \\"mow the lawn\\" and \\"walk the dog.\\"<br /><br />Def Leppard's lyrics from their debut album, \\"On through the Night,\\" when they were in their early 20, are actually pretty edgy and cool. Certainly light-years better than this dribble.<br /><br />The catchy mid-tempo \\"Heaven is,\\" not surprisingly co-written by Clarke, is one of the album's best songs. \\"Make Love like a Man,\\" (also co-written by Clarke) is just pure cheese.

That such an album, so out of place in the early 90s, should be so successful, is a testament to how popular Def Leppard had been. The pure 80s sounding \\"Adrenalize\\" proved not only to be Def Leppard's last hit album, (minus 1993's  \\"Retro Active\\" rarities album) but also proved to be pop-metal's last hurrah. \\"Adrenalize\\" was the last album of its type to enjoy multi-platinum success.

B0009UC7H0|2.0|The excessive use of irrelevant 1970s music adds nothing to this interesting adventure story.  At times it is nearly impossible to understand the dialogue due to the volume of the music.  Most of the music (songs) chosen have absolutely nothing to do with the story and they mainly serve to ruin the experience.  The book was many times more interesting.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This review will wrote itself. I'm just giving it 1 star to lower the average. No further explanation is needed for this piece of turd! Buy \\"Train of Thought\\" by Dream Theater instead.
0345440900|2.0|This book made me so anxious and neurotic about getting on a schedule, constant preaching about avoiding \\"accidental parenting\\"... I \\"fired\\" this book after trying to follow it for 8 weeks. After doing so, I became much more calm and peaceful.  <br /> <br />Thanks to Dr Weissbluth \\"Healthy sleep habits, Happy Child\\". Our 6 month old baby sleeps for 12 hours through the night (since 12 weeks old) and takes two or three 2 hour naps. Our little one is very peaceful, happy baby. <br /> <br />And we didn't have to do any sleep training, no cry it out!  <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is some of the tips on soothing where helpful. <br /> <br />
B00008S2VG|2.0|..Where to begin?  Ok, Madonna's \\"American Life\\" started in Bay City, Michigan and eventually made it to Rochester Michigan where to average median salary is $74,914 (2003).  She was born into a Catholic family and spoke with a midwest accent.  She grew up with things given to her, now she aims to bite the hand that feeds her in the name of selling albums in her new home.  Somehow, she moves to Europe, signs up with a bunch of existing excellent dance producers, speaks with a british accent, and wears the American flag like a diaper on taco night.   The music itself is halfway decent, but I prefer artists who are \\"real\\" and \\"true\\" to themselves.  Unfortunately, this comes of as true as Vanilla Ice.  Actually, atleast Vanilla Ice said he was from Miami.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, Madonna is a great businesswomen.  I gave this album two stars for that simple fact.  I predict that those under the age of 26 will give this album a chance.  I also predict that people who don't like what I say will simply not recommend this review.
B000021XS0|5.0|This was the first Dream Theater album I ever purchased, and it was because of this that I have not let up since. I was spurred onto this group by the bassist of my band, and I have never doubted his musical tastes since. <br /> <br />All the players on this album are virtuosic in their own right, but reviewing this album simply based on the talent of the players misses half of the concept. <br /> <br />The writing on this album is nothing short of visionary. Not only has this group taken a song from one of their previous albums and turned it into this epic concept album, they have done it in such a way that the album can be enjoyed without any knowledge of \\"Images and Words\\" (as did I). <br /> <br />Dream Theater uses the concept of this musical epic to exact a storyline that not only fleshes out the album to those who are interested in more than just music, but it also permits them to leapfrog styles (gospel, metal, acoustic rock to name just a few). <br /> <br />If you are in doubt about Dream Theater, this is the album to buy first. You will be treated to every inch of why they are the most innovative and virtuosic band out there.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This is probably 1 of the best live albums that I've heard in a long time. The sound on it is just incredable. There's only 2 songs that's not on it that that I wish that they would've put on it, that's \\"No Life\\" & \\"My Plague.\\" Those are 2 of my favorite Slipknot songs. Other than that, the CD's really great & is a must for all Slipknot fans.
B0006L0LNY|1.0|How could a movie that features Halle Berry in a skimmpy, tight leather outfit be watchable. Well cause it's Hally Berry and she's hot but that's not enough to make this movie be worth anything. She doesn't even become Catwoman until about 1/2 hour in the movie. This movie is slow too. Not worth renting, watching at the bigscreen, watching it on HBO cable, or downloading on DVD burner. Sharon Stone has become un-attractive especially in this movie.
B00004XQP4|5.0|OK, so you bought \\"Dookie\\" in college, loved how all the songs were irreverant and unique, and played it at your keg parties. Then you moved on to grunge, or hip-hop, and forgot about Green Day until last year when American Idiot knocked everyone's socks off. Now you're wondering what this unpredictable and underrated group has been up to in the meantime. So buy ALL of the albums that came out in between, because every one is great in its own way, but listen to \\"Warning\\" first. This is where we saw flashes of what was to come in terms of songwriting maturity and political awareness. The in-your-face messages of American Idiot appear in more subtle and ironic forms in songs such as \\"Minority,\\" \\"Warning,\\" and \\"Church on Sunday.\\" \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" is Green Day's most beautiful song before \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends.\\" And \\"Misery\\" is just plain fun wrapped up in brilliant melodies. The band's punk fan base might like the other albums more, but for fans who like their more mature sound, this is the album to buy.
B0007OCG56|5.0|In this movie I like seeing a little different side of Adam Sandler he is more serious and had emotions. I was very surprised by this movie. Amidst the well written comedy scenes, there are many LIFE-IMPACTING conversations. If you pay attention to this movie, I think you will learn something about yourself, about cultural differences, about responsibility...all while having a few good laughs and a good time. (I know I sound like corney Dr. Phil). Go see this movie, I think Paz Vega is a stand out in her first big Hollywood appearance. her character could have lighten up she said no to just about anything, she won't let her daughter have $50, won't let her go to private school, she quite her job and moved out of the lovely house, she rejected Adam \\"which was stupid\\". Mrs. Leoni overacts and become quit bothersome. She's probable a CRACK-HEAD or RETARTED! The little latin daughter does a fine job at acting and she's very sexy \\"Salma Hayek\\" better watch out!
B00005JMCT|5.0|I hate to see it end. The American Pie movies were great for a laugh. They're your typical childish humor, but that's what you expect to get. Maybe they'll make a 4th version in 60 years when they're all in a retirement home.
0446577383|1.0|Like many I pre-ordered this book before knowing much about it.  Baldacci's early books were so darn good that I keep trying, but the thrill is gone for me.  Others have rated this highly, and I will admit that I only read 50 pages, so maybe it's just me.  In the early part of the book we are introduced to 6 losers, all unlikeable, depressing characters.  There was no one to identify with or care about.  On top of that, conspiracy theories don't do much for me when they remind me too much of real demonstrators on the far left who keep harping on how President Bush supposedly \\"lied\\" about our country's reasons for going to war.  Maybe this book would have turned into something more appealing had I stuck with it, but life is too short to read a book that turns you off right from the start.  I hate to give such a negative review, especially when it seems lots of readers loved it, so:  My recommendation is that you read the first chapter or two before deciding whether or not to buy the book.
B000001FVL|5.0|This album was a definitive soundtrack of the times, that being 1980 and thereabouts, a forgotten time period for many.  It seemed the world was poised between disco and New Wave, a gap that Blondie so nicely covered with \\"Heart of Glass.\\"  It's all about the synth-pop here.  Early 80's sci-fi lyrics, running commentary on media and its place in society, and dark optimism aside, this disc is pop, pure and simple.  As an acquaintance at the time put it, \\"It's music even your mother can enjoy.\\"  Uh, yeah...especially I Love You Miss Robot, Elstree, and Astroboy.   <br /> <br />Its timeless beauty lies mainly in Trevor Horn's production; anyone owning this album in its heyday knew Horn would go on to huge success, which of course he did.   <br /> <br />If you like the songs, you must check out Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club's \\"English Garden.\\"  He co-wrote \\"Video\\" and \\"Clean Clean\\" and the sound is much more of a rock band--and a young Thomas Dolby plays the keyboards to boot!
B000002NIW|4.0|My favorite Deftones record by far is \\"Adrenaline\\", however this is still a really good record.  The style has changed a bit, which may not have been a bad thing.  \\"Around the Fur\\" shows that Chino & the fella's have matured as artists a lot in the time between albums.  My Fav. Tracks are \\"Mascera\\", \\"My Own Summer\\", \\"Around the Fur\\", \\"Be Quiet\\", & \\"rickets\\".  Check it out!!!!!!!!!
B00006IU73|5.0|Along with Opeth, Porcupine Tree is one of those bands that have managed to renew my faith in a genre that I thought had exhasuted every possibility and trick in the book, which is rock music. Over their decade-long career, the group managed to cover quite a great lot of ground, starting out as an atmospheric, psycheledic, progressive-influenced rock band to a fully realised pop-rock outfit that do not deny its progressive roots. In Absentia, their first major-label album, has the sound of a band reaching for an even higher peak than before. <br /> <br />One of the greatest strengths of the band's music would be the variety of moods conveyed through the album and the talent involved in the communication of these feelings to us. \\"Blackest Eyes\\" is most likely the band's fiercest song to date, providing  a grinding guitar lead worthy of a metal band backed with Wilson's melodic sensibility. It's catchy as hell, yet doesn't feel dumbed down or tamed for lethargic audiences. Why is that song not a radio hit by today is beyond me. <br /> <br />\\"Trains\\" and \\"Prodigal\\" are contemplative and reflective, coupled with great melodies and impressive vocal arrangements. \\"Sound of Muzak\\" is a quite complex, yet catchy song on which Wilson talks smack about the music industry's state as of now: \\"Now the sound of music comes in silver pills... Engineered to suit you, building cheaper thrills.\\" The song is another competent, yet catchy song that plays around with different time signatures. <br /> <br />\\"Heartattack in a Layby\\" is one of the most emotionnal songs that has came from the group, featuring a lonely guitar lead and very eerie, minimalist keyboard effects. Wilson, who is already a great vocalist, shines even further on this song, especially near the end. This song and \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" just shows up that whenever it comes down to vocal harmonies, this band can't be beaten. Elsewhere, \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape\\" and \\"Strip the Soul\\" get rid of almost every trace of sweetmelodies and hammer away at the listen with raw, agressive metal guitars and especially cold lyrics. <br /> <br />This would have to be one of these rare albums that manage to be almost everything but never loses cohesion or feel like a bunch of unrelated tracks stuck to each other for no reason. This is almost as perfect than a rock album can actually be. Whether you want your music slow, fast, heavy, sad, emotional, provocative or angry, this album has it all there. Whether you know the band's prior achievements or not is no reason you shouldn't check this album out. Buy it, you won't regret it.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This is one of the best rock records of the 90's, def. helped start out the whole Nu metal thing.  Much better than the records Chino & the crew released in later years.  My Fav tracks are \\"Minus Blindfold\\", \\"One Weak\\", \\"7 Words\\", \\"Birthmark\\" & \\"Fireal\\".  Also, \\"Around the Fur\\" is a decent record, check it out if you like this.
0393327655|5.0|Harris writes in a vigorous lucid style that should appeal to open-minded thinkers, both nonreligious and religious, as he examines alleged holy books and how these books, always claiming exclusive truth, spur hostility toward groups of people who carry the \\"wrong beliefs.\\"<br /><br />Harris will not tolerate a watered-down interpretation of holy scripture. He shows passages from all the alleged holy books that demand killing nonbelievers and idolaters and shows that so-called religious \\"moderates\\" don't adhere to these scriptural passages due to ignorance and neglect, not because of their religiosity. In other words, one of his central arguments is that the more religious one is, the more one is likely to engage in violence. The \\"moderate\\" believer is someone who doesn't really believe. Therefore, he concludes religion at its essence is a dangerous doctrine of superstition and tribalistic hostility.<br /><br />Again, no matter what you do or do not believe, you will be impressed with Harris' writing style, his forceful polemics and his vigorous tone. As a writer regardless of the subject matter, Harris is topnotch.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|She shouts <br />She can't sing live <br />She has no looks what so ever <br />But with an outstanding voice coach, loads of technical work, lots of buttons, loads of machines and crazy fans, Avril Lavigne has made it to the top with a voice that isn't hers. Like her, don't like the album, don't think she can sing. Well, why is she a star? God only knows, but good luck to her and good luck to you if you buy this album. Keep it down though or you may be hearing from the neighbours. I know a lot of people that would complain just to have a pic of her in the house. Poor girl. At least she has her so called fans. Her strange fans who think she can sing. Her strange fans who believe her Grandad is dead and she actually wrote a song about it. Anyway, back to the album. Don't buy it. Keep ur valuable dollars and save them to sign the protest to bring her out of the charts. It's for her own good. We would be saving her from embarrasment. No offence Avril!
0684824906|5.0|Although Thomas Jefferson was the great Renaissance man among US Presidents, Abraham Lincoln was the great conciliator, a defining trait that became invaluable during the nation's only home-fought civil war (so far). Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin makes this very clear with her meticulously researched, thoroughly readable volume on Lincoln's presidency. Beyond his plain-spoken manner, his uncommon gift was for reading people instinctively and persuading them to work together in following his vision. That vision, as anyone with any memory of an American history text book knows, is eliminating the expansion of slavery into federal territories.<br /><br />Beating out three high-profile national candidates - William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates - for the Republican nomination for president in 1860, Lincoln enacted the unthinkable - he made all three competitors key members of his cabinet: Seward as Secretary of State, Chase as Treasury Secretary and Bates as Attorney General. Staying true to his vision, Lincoln managed by cleverly playing on their egos and senses of duty and persuading them to serve in his cabinet, even though the appointments meant ignoring political debts and other partisan imperatives. What made this executive decision all the more impressive is that the nation was at that moment polarized over the issue of slavery - with abolitionists in the North, secessionists in the South and compromisers from Missouri to Maryland making and breaking deals of convenience. With the aid of those three key players, Lincoln had to negotiate between radical and moderate Republican leaders, who were often far apart on the issues, while attempting to win support from War Democrats and loyalists in the seceding states.<br /><br />This is not to say Lincoln was naïve in his approach. In fact, Goodwin describes an extremely bumpy ride along the way, as Lincoln's presidency was marked by confrontation and controversy. In fact, he was sometimes incapacitated by depression perhaps brought on, as Goodwin asserts, by an abusive father. Nonetheless, his melancholic nature did not prevent him from relying on his defining instincts on the political scene back then - a self-taught wisdom, generosity, shrewd judgment and a trust in America's nobler impulses and instincts. But beyond the noble characteristics was Lincoln's uncompromising nature, and as Goodwin observes with acuity, he frequently overstepped the traditional bounds of executive power. For example, he issued executive orders suspending habeas corpus, imprisoned opposing government officials, and ordered the arrest of a number of publishers. In his steadfast way, he also refused to make any effort at compromise with the seceding states. That is hardly the behavior of a man of the people, but it is one aspect of the man that Goodwin confirms heartily with her research.<br /><br />Given his impulses, Lincoln could be egregiously wrong on some issues, for instance, the case of General George McClellan, for whom Lincoln permitted delaying attacking the Confederates and giving the South time to strengthen their forces. Even in this situation, Lincoln's resolve paved the way for McClellan to win the Battle of Antietam when the North's losses had become severe, and he used the victory to unveil the Emancipation Proclamation. Such timing of events, as Goodwin shows, was just as intentional in the 1860's as it has been in recent administrations when public support starts to flag. Only a month after the victory, Lincoln did what he should have done in the first place - fire McClellan.<br /><br />The guiding principle for Lincoln was not to encourage differing factions to use their energy to work against each other but rather to encourage them to confront their differences head-on by having them work together closely. The antagonistic voices will naturally moderate and countervail each other. Parallels between Lincoln's wartime presidency and recent administrations would be contrived, and Goodwin thankfully makes no serious attempt at them. In nearly 800 pages, most of which feel essential in telling the full story, Goodwin vividly evokes Lincoln's internalized struggles to avoid war, his singular resolve to fight hard once war became inevitable, and his unflagging effort to hold the fragile union together. That part of Lincoln's story is to be expected given Goodwin's credentials as a historical writer. What she does with immaculate skill is show how a conflicted man paradoxically trusted his conciliatory nature to fulfill his vision. That's the true history lesson that resonates with her exemplary book.ns would be contrived, and Goodwin thankfully makes no serious attempt at them.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Alright, first of all this movie jumps around and trys to make connections that do not exist.  It is like saying I was born in May so was JFK, I must be his reincarnated spirit.  Of course Moore is able to make this argument a little more effectively with relatively clever wit and use of very clever music. <br /> <br />I will hand it to him, he is bright, but the people that enjoy this and buy into perhaps are not or are just grossly uninformed.  I by no means am defending the President or saying that this administration has been perfect- but come on!!!! <br /> <br />I got my graduate degree in public policy and one thing I can say for sure is that it should definetly have focused a lot more on rhetoric and distorting the truth b/c that sadly is what people are now letting their votes be swung by. <br /> <br />And just by this movie, but by ads (on both sides of the aisle) and trash like this. <br /> <br />There are going to be people who love this, most of them will be relatively uninformed and already disliking the president and the war- this is merely fuel to their fire.

0060764899|5.0|A PR man recently lamented that the movie of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was not being sold with the pitch, \\"See the Bible come alive!\\"  But while Christian elements appear in various guises throughout C. S. Lewis's \\"Chronicles\\" you may search both Testaments, the Apocrypha, and the wealth of extracanonical writings BC and AD and find nothing about Narnia.   <br /> <br />This first installment was published in 1950 with the subtitle \\"A Story for Children,\\" and in his dedication Lewis calls it a \\"fairy tale\\":  it is set during World War II, when many London children were sent away in hopes of finding safe in the countryside.  In addition to the usual fairy tale contingent of a wicked witch of great powers, trolls and ogres and werewolves, Lewis has added the naiads and dryads, fauns and centaurs from Greek and Latin myth, as befits a classics professor, plus Father Christmas.  When Aslan, the great Lion, is first mentioned one-third of the way through, his status as a Christ figure will be unmistakable---to any adult.  But how many children of eight or ten---the premium age to enter Narnia---will recognize allusions to the Agony in the Garden, or interpret the sacrifice of Aslan at the Stone Table by the White Witch as the Crucifixion, or his return as the Resurrection?  (The \\"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\" plus \\"Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time\\" are tough doctrinal nuts to crack at a young age; I never understood them at the time, and now their arbitrary nature---to provide a rationale for the plot---rather sticks out.)  Aslan's trials and triumphs are much sweeter than the Passion Story, which is shot through with a larger sadder view of human nature and destiny.   <br /> <br />The vivid pacing and emotional charge of Lewis's narrative bears all before it:  one is swept along.  What one recalls in after-years are images from high fantasy:  the lamppost visible from the depths of the wardrobe, which shows one is leaving this world for Narnia;the Dwarf handing Edward the Witch's steaming tempting brew; her castleful of stone creatures being turned back to flesh by Aslan's breath.  This is due in no small part to Pauline Baynes's witty, elegant, endearing illustrations, which are as much a part of Narnia as Tenniel's are of Wonderland and the Looking-Glass World, or Louise Fitzhugh's of Harriet the Spy's beat.   <br /> <br />\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" bear the imprint of the time when they were written, and the author who wrote them, as every book does; but where Harry Potter finds most of his adherents in readers near his own age, and Tolkien's Middle Earth calls out to young and middle-aged and old alike, for what they can bring to it, Lewis was right---these are stories for children.  As I reread them today, I see the boy I was when I first read them; for as an adult one can revisit, reappraise, and criticize, but one cannot recapture Narnia.  <br />
B000002AGM|5.0|Most people who listen to Miles Davis are immediately drawn to the broodingly sensitive tone and style which he developed after his formidable stint with Charlie Parker. Without getting too far into a jazz history lesson, Davis wanted to make the post-Bird music sound \\"pretty\\" and didn't want to address the madness of the world at that time, so to speak, that the boppers were so desperately trying to portray. That is to be expected, considering his background. Miles Davis as a singular performer was and posthumously still is one of the most unique and piercing artists in the musical idiom and he could singularly carry a recording. Along with Louis Armstrong and a hand full of other innovators he was able to express the poignant complexity of the human condition through his playing that touches us in a profoundly emotional and spiritual way.  What makes this recording a monument however is the addition of Gil Evans and the beauty and genius of his arrangements. Anyone who is a fan of jazz already knows that the form, when executed properly, is readily capable of tapping into pith and pathos of the truly human experience. It addresses issues that \\"proper\\" classical music ignores. This is not to say that I don't like classical music but, considering the general history of humanity, the emotional content of music prior to the mid-nineteenth century is a bit antiquated and doesn't express the true spectrum of experience of a post-atomic society. To me this recording displays the pinnacle of the possibilities of music. Not only are the arrangements compelling in there dynamic and musical content, but the particular performers give the arrangements their due...; unbelievable execution throughout. (Listening to the alternate takes on this reissue backs this point) This is the \\"great American novel\\" of music. I could go on and on; but to the point... If you have an ear and a brain and a heart, you'll probably get it. Lack one, however, lacks all three (to parody Walt Whitman). Listen for yourself.). Listen for yourself.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|This movie is based loosely on Japanese history during the Sengoku (Warring States) Period (mid 1500s to early 1600s) when powerful feudal lords (daimyos), each ruling their own domains in a fragmented Japan, fought each other for supremacy over the country.  Such samurai warlords included men like Takeda Shingen, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa leyasu (the future shogun).  This film features all three of these giant figures of the Sengoku Period and focuses on an attempt by the leaders of Lord Shingen's Takeda clan to hide his sudden death.  Even though historians are not entirely sure on whether Shingen had died from a sniper shot or from illness, this film takes the former theory and moves on to telling another story in Kurosawa's distinctive style.  This film looks expensive with the showing of numerous extras as soldiers and horsemen, but Kurosawa's battle scenes are about formation and momentum rather than actual close-combat fighting.  Like in his other film RAN, this one focuses on the devastating effect of firearms on warfare and the self-destructive nature of war.  Like in RAN, an entire clan destroys itself by rushing into  an unnecessary attack.  Any director with a huge budget can make a big battle scene, but Kurosawa has a unique gift for making violence look grand and gruesome and yet dramatic and poetic at the same time.  Just love the scenes showing the great Oda Nobunaga and his warming to things western like red wine, Catholic missionaries, European armour and a feathered red hat.

B0006IIKS0|4.0|Very good documentary that will appeal to anyone with a keen interest in the inner workings of a rock band. Equal parts redemption story and kitchen-sink drama, \\"Metallica - Some Kind of Monster\\" is an honest but self-indulgent look into the private world of multi-millionaire rockers who, at the end of the day, simply cannot communicate their love and respect for each other, and the band they have made so famous. <br /> <br />Band leader James Hetfield, fresh out of rehab, constantly locks horns with \\"I-just-wanna-play-rock-n-roll\\" drummer Lars Ulrich, and spends most of his time fretting over his self-imposed 4-hour per day work schedule, and whether he even wants to be in the band anymore. Ulrich meanwhile fakes interest in Hetfield's mental recovery, the farcical \\"lyrics-by-committee\\" approach to the new record, and seems happiest when his multi-million dollar collection of modern art goes under the hammer for record prices. Guitarist Kirk Hammett equivocates on most of the key decisions and discussions, but comes off as a straightforward guy just wanting the best for his band and his buddies. All of which, much to Metallica's credit, is captured mercilessly by the camera crew. This includes the most bizarre aspect of the film, in which an ever present middle-aged Dr. Eugene Landy-type, hired by the band for $40k per month to help guide and mediate their feelings towards one another, presides over most of the discussion, and hilariously tries to ingratiate himself into the band in a creative capacity. He is clearly a chancer, despised by Ulrich in particular, and living on borrowed time. The scene, in which even Hetfield himself has had enough of this pseudo-guru, and tries to fire him, is perhaps the most uncomfortable in the whole film. <br /> <br />Coming off best are producer Bob Rock - clearly the voice of reason, and clearly the only person respected by all the band - who gently draws out of Metallica the record they want to make, and new bass player, Robert Trujillo, whose audition sparks the first genuine musical camaraderie in the whole documentary. His arrival seems the perfect denouement to the film as Hetfield and Ulrich's two-decade friendship is refreshed, and they begin to see new potential and meaning to playing in their band. Recommended. <br /> <br />
B00001OH7X|5.0|Bowie in 77-78 made 3 experimental vanguard albums with Brian Eno(roxy music), while he 'cleaned up' in the run down Turkish section of W Germany.   <br /> <br />This is the least regarded but easiest listen of the Berlin trio.  It has several hit singles, and lacks an instrumental second side, and is thus a transition out of the Berlin period into his most popular Scary Monsters/Lets Dance MTV era.   <br /> <br />This is a fascinating period in rock music, as his hit songs and experimental work influenced 'post punk' and 'new wave' music to come.  There was a type of delayed impact, in that for the next few years, the punk explosion of 76-77 took over, not his concurrent synthesizer and studio experimentation.   <br /> <br />After punk though, artists (Joy Division, Bauhaus, Duran Duran) wanted a wider range than what punk had to offer, and they were profoundly influenced by Bowie.  Not only is his influence somewhat forgotten now, but also the fact that this was a major artist at his prime going far far into the left field.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I will start by confessing to be a huge fan of the series where I think Whedon had done a phenomenal job on the character development. You really know and care about these people so I will admit to the movie being more enjoyable to fans of the series. What a surprise. I do think the movie holds it's own as a separate entity however. To anybody that says this movie was predictable : could you please email me tonight's winning lotto numbers. I haven't been this entertained since the first time I saw Star Wars in 1977. I would love to see another one or the series brought back but if this is all I get I am extremely grateful for this. Everyone in the theater I saw it in applauded at the end and you don't see that very often. For a movie with this much entertainment value to only do 25 mil at the box office is beyond me. You can only blame the promotion people and certainly not the film.
B000002G26|5.0|For those individuals not familiar with Bryan's work..this is a short but sweet sampling of some of his finest songs. Sure it doesn't include anywhere close to ALL of his hits, but if you are looking for a quick sampler to determine whether or not you'll like this artists work this is a great one to start with. As a long time fan of Adams, I can say his popularity has fallen a bit in recent years..but his musicanship and songs are as good as ever. Bryan was a powerhouse 80's pop rocker with songs like Run To You, Cuts Like a Knife, This Time, Somebody and others. He also has the versatility to churn out great ballads such as Please Forgive Me and Do I have to Say the Words? I can't say enough about this record....If you like it even a little it will go a long way...and as I said it's a great starter piece to the much larger and richer Bryan Adams sampling. If you happen to like Ryan Adams, his stuff is great too, but far different so just make sure you don't get them confused. Other than that..happy listening and be sure to check out some of Bryan's newer stuff from records like Room Service

Even worse is the kids that are fans buy into what the band says and then think they know everything about state of the world. Do yourself a favor and buy some original music like Isis, Mastodon, Devin Townsend, or Dream theater they actually write creative music.
B000001FT2|2.0|After reading many reviews of NIGHTCLUBBING, I was tempted to buy this album because the reviews almost all hysterically proclaimed this album to be great and that all the songs on it were good. But caution prevailed and I sampled four or five songs other than \\"I've Seen That Face Before\\", which I knew from the start was good. Result? I didn't like any of the others. In my opinion, they were nowhere near the quality of \\"I've Seen That Face Before\\". Now I am just one reviewer of many but perhaps these other reviewers could be friends of the studio and are stuffing the ballot box, so to speak. I don't know. But at least you have another point of view. To me, \\"I've Seen That Face Before\\" is a dynamite song. If I like that one, how could I be wrong about the others? I'll leave that for you to think about. \\"Ive Seen That Face Before\\" was used on the sountrack to FRANTIC, which starred Harrison Ford, and is the song playing when Ford and his friend are dancing in the restaurant. This is an amazing and wonderful song. It has a driving beat with vocals in English and French. To me it is Parisian cafe noir and, oh, so cool. You love it. Whether you'll love the rest of the album, mon ami, I jest don't know.
0740748475|5.0|I received my set of books with the edges dented a little (the 3 books inside were still intact. damage was only on the hardcover). So if you're planning to buy this collection and ship it someplace far, I suggest you try Courier. I hope you guys at Amazon can consider to bubble wrap heavy books in future.      Ok, back to the books.  \\"Made/Printed in China\\" was the most striking thing for me. Nevertheless I still give it a '5-star' rating simply because this is the 'complete works' of my all-time favourite cartoonist.     But seriously... made in China??? I paid USD price... hmm...  I have a collection of other original C&H books back in the 90's; back then it was still \\"Made/Printed in USA\\". Print quality is very different.  I feel that the colour tone and the type of paper used in the books are a bit 'inferior' quality. Why do the pictures have to be so 'glossy' resulting in the colour tone being a bit 'off'.  But this is just my personal opinion anyway. Don't let this stop you from buying!  No true fan is complete without owning this!    Hmmm... still a '5-star' rating simply because this is the 'complete works' !! Thank you for coming out with it and thank you for publishing it, this is still going to be in a prominent place in my library.  I just wish it was better quality!!!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Don't get me wrong. I love the Foo Fighters. I have most of their music.

This is NOT pirating music! And if I can't copy this, I won't buy it. If I pay for it I should have the right to make a copy for myself.  <br /> <br />And like anyone else, too, I DO NOT want to BUY garbage to put on my computer.  <br /> <br />Don't waste your money.

0316168815|5.0|Alice's \\"Lucky\\" memoir was ironically titled as a comment on an insensitive statement by a police officer after Alice was \\"only\\" raped, unlike the last woman to be attacked in the same location, who had been brutally murdered. Like singer/songwriter Tori Amos, who co-founded RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) Alice is a rape survivor, and this brutal life-changing event fuelled the brilliant yet disturbing novel The Lovely Bones. <br /> <br />What follows is just my own take on the story. We all interpret things differently, so here we have my two cents' worth... <br /> <br />Like the Tim Robbins movie Jacob's Ladder, The Lovely Bones is the victim's Book of the Dead journey of the soul. The heaven she describes does not exist except as the quantum reality that the Between Lives Area manifests as. No, we cannot die. We can lose our bodies, but we go on and eventually come back and back and back... and I have had enough past life regression to be quite sure about that.  <br /> <br />(Spoiler-ish thingy coming up...) Where she interacts with Ruth, in the form of a temporary Walk In or benign possession, this may actually take place or it may be a fantasy, we have no way of knowing, nor does she. <br /> <br />The name Salmon may have been chosen to represent the cycle of Return. Salmon live in the sea until maturity - between 1 and 7 years, depending on the species; and some migrate hundreds, and even thousands of miles in the sea. They then somehow return to the place where they hatched and continue the Cycle. No-one knows how salmon can possibly find their way home. Susie Salmon finds her way back to revisit the people she spent her brief life with as part of a greater finding her way Home. <br /> <br />As for the connection between all things, the subject of Non-Locality as it relates to prayer and spiritual issues/human relationships, hinges on Bell's Theorem, as proposed by John Bell in 1964. Bell's Theorem, which is supported by experimental evidence, indicates that once subatomic particles have been in contact, they always remain connected. A change in one creates a concurrent change in the other, even if they are a universe apart. Susie's connection to events can be explained both in physical terms i.e. the quantum field, and in spiritual terms, whereby her soul (which exists outside of space-time) is initially unwilling to let go of the Earth and her incomplete life.  <br /> <br />The book succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is as a much-needed reminder that we must do everything possible to eradicate the basis for male violence against women. <br /> <br />Steven Cain, author of Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is a must have. If you don't own it already, BUY IT. <br /> <br />If you don't love this album then you just don't get it.   <br /> <br />I don't need to repeat the already good reviews of the album on here, but I highly reccomend this album as a great starter album to get to know Green Day or to a die hard fan. This album is easily the best album of any genre that I have heard in the last five years.
B000B9EY2U|4.0|You'd never imagine in 1984 that the band who brought &quot;People Are People&quot; to American shores would still be putting out addictive, amazing music twenty-one years later.  Depeche Mode surely seemed to be a flash in the pan in a Bruce Springsteen world; why should anyone take them seriously?<br /><br />Indeed.  Playing the Angel is a better album than any band DM's age has a right to put together.  These three Basildon boys have tossed F. Scott Fitzgerald's observation that &quot;There are no second acts&quot; right out the proverbial window, leaving ardent fans in an extended state of elation, and thickheaded detractors of &quot;synth-pop&quot; scratching their heads yet again.<br /><br />So, just how good is it?  Good enough that, if you ever liked Depeche Mode, you must own this CD.  It will bowl you over.  And if you're a deep DM fan, like yours truly, then you need the limited edition with attendant DVD as well.<br /><br />On to the substance of these two discs:<br /><br />THE CD:<br /><br />Playing the Angel opens up with a vacillating shriek reminiscent of the intro to &quot;I Feel You,&quot; making quite clear that we are not about to hear another sleepy album.  Now I am not about to hop on the bandwagon and decry Ultra and Exciter as utter crap.  Both albums are actually quite good, but they have personalities distinct from earlier sin-binges such as Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  They are mood pieces.  But this album works for pretty much any mood familiar to a Mode junkie.<br /><br />One of the controversial (among longtime DM fans) aspects of PTA is the bigger role lead singer Dave Gahan is taking in the band.  Three songs on this album are written by Gahan, and they stand up quite well compared to Gore's work.  &quot;Nothing's Impossible&quot; is a dirge on the one hand, repeatedly striking the same deathly chord, and the verse lyrics confirm the mood.  Yet the chorus strangely reveals either a perversely optimistic bent, or the desire for it.  The song leaves an indelible impression and demands repeated play.<br /><br />&quot;Suffer Well&quot; is even better, a fast-paced tale of woe that reminds me of &quot;Walking in My Shoes.&quot;  Gnarly guitar roots around in the synth beats until the chorus blooms like a rose, redeeming the suffering speaker.  The effect is almost transcendental.<br /><br />But Gahan's writing isn't the only noteworthy item here.  Gore's songs are in no way complacent, tugging at the boundaries of the Depeche Mode ouevre.  &quot;Precious&quot; is of course the first single of the album, and rightly so.  When I first heard this song, I thought, &quot;this sounds like Erasure,&quot; which is another way of saying it sounds like early Depeche Mode.  Here, Gahan sings Gore's apologetic lyric, mourning a divorce and its effects on children.  It's an opulent, dark, moving piece not quite like anything else DM has ever done, yet entirely at home in Playing the Angel.<br /><br />&quot;Sinner in Me&quot; is thematically more familiar, but no DM song has ever sounded so at home in a strip club.  This one oozes sex, sin, and a yearning for something purer while we behave in a very dirty fashion, all against a seductively slow beat.<br /><br />Following tradition, Gore saved two songs for himself to sing: &quot;Macro&quot; and &quot;Damaged People.&quot;  &quot;Macro&quot; is probably the better of the two, using backing strings in the chorus to good effect.  &quot;Damaged People,&quot; as the title suggests, is about a relationship between two frail individuals who can't really stand to be alone.  In its own way, it is the descendant of &quot;It Doesn't Matter,&quot; &quot;It Doesn't Matter Two,&quot; and &quot;A Question of Lust.&quot;<br /><br />The closer for Playing the Angel is also probably one of its best songs: &quot;The Darkest Star.&quot;  This is a slow, hypnotizing, dark blast of electronic music, alternately menacing and brooding.<br /><br />The only track that can reasonably be called filler is &quot;Lilian,&quot; and even DM filler is better than most bands can muster on a good day.  It's not bad, but it's a little more throwaway than the rest of the album.<br /><br />These twelve songs have a cohesive, star-lit, distorted feel to them, and unquestionably constitute the best DM album since Violator.  In many ways it seems that making another Violator is an elusive holy grail for DM, but if they keep putting out albums like PTA while on this quixotic quest, I certainly will not object.  Five stars are easy to give to this phenomenally good album from a band that deserves recognition for its enduring, unique sound.<br /><br />THE DVD:<br /><br />This is a real treat for die-hard fans, or for anyone who really appreciates the songs on Playing the Angel.  The album itself is playable on your DVD player in 5.1 (DTS or Dolby Digital Surround) and stereo.  Making the Angel is a brief documentary with interviews from the usual suspects, including Daniel Miller.  The photo gallery is nice if forgettable, and the video for &quot;Precious&quot; is very slick and atmospheric; check it out if you have not already.<br /><br />But the biggest surprise is &quot;Clean (bare).&quot;  It's shot like a very casual music video, in Corbijnesque black and white, while Gore strums a guitar and Gahan delivers a heartfelt, sensitive rendition of the lyrics.  It's an acoustic, melancholy, achingly beautiful surprise, and the guitar riff is just faintly reminiscent of the moldy oldie &quot;House of the Rising Sun.&quot;  It may be the best version of &quot;Clean&quot; I have ever heard.<br /><br />IN CLOSING:<br /><br />If you like Depeche Mode, Playing the Angel is a must-buy.  It will be in your head for weeks or months to come.  And the extras on the DVD are worth just a bit more cash for all but the stingiest of music lovers.<br /><br />Pick this one up.  There will be no disappointments.asonably be called filler is &quot;Lilian,&quot; and even DM filler is better than most bands can muster on a good day.

1573228737|2.0|I picked this book up because a friend recommended it, I dont know if I will be listening to him in the future. The book is only about 350 pages and it took me a week to read it, where normally it would take about 2 to 3 days, (I normally get really into books and cant put them down).  This book is extremely boring for the first 300 or so pages.  I dont like the way its narrated. The author switches back and forth between the main character's diary entries, Margaret Prior and Selina Dawes', the prisoner. I didnt mind so much reading Prior's take, it dragged a bit, but it has a few interesting bits. BUT, the sections where Dawes narrated were EXTREMELY BORING, and most of it seemingly pointless, I think now that Ive finished the book. I think that either some of the story was left unexplained, or I didnt pay close enough attention, because I still dont know who Peter Quick is, but I dont think I really care.    The only reason Im giving this more than one star is the end. The last 40 pages or so were very good and came as a pleasant surprise. I wasnt expecting that at all.     Would I recommend this book? Only if you are really patient and enjoy boring books with fairly surprising endings.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I have been a harsh critic of this band and their tendancy to go too far. This CD is a pleasant surprise and actually a shock because I was expecting it to stink after their previous &#34;train wreck of thought&#34;. Three things struck me on this new CD:  1. They don't go too far with jams and excessive wankarama  2. Jordan finally fits into the band...instead of trying to outplay everyone on keys  3. The songs are melodic in the tradition of Awake  Really a good strong effort from the band.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|A friend let me borrow a subtitled Japanese DVD of this movie, with a simple recommendation: \\"You'll love it.\\"  And he was right.<br /><br />To be honest, I haven't played a Final Fantasy game since the original one for the NES, which means that I missed out on \\"Final Fantasy VII,\\" the game this movie is essentially a sequel to.<br /><br />That said, I was nevertheless enthralled by \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.\\"  I could tell, as the story played out, that there were things I was missing out on.  Characters were introduced that I wasn't familiar with but were obviously important somehow, and plot points, while summarized enough so that I could understand them, would clearly have been more meaningful if I was familiar with the story of the game. This should have meant that I couldn't get into the film -- but I did anyway.<br /><br />I think it was the animation that captivated me at first; it is beautiful throughout.  The film is entirely computer-animated, with a strong leaning toward attention to detail and realism in appearance.  While the textures don't quite meet up to the high standard set in \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,\\" they don't have to.  The animation for \\"Advent Children\\" is stylized to just the right degree, with lots of detail, and a sense of motion that most CGI films just can't capture.  It's here, in the quick movements of characters and how they interact with scenery, where the animation actually exceeds that of \\"Spirits Within,\\" as that film didn't capture motion quite as effectively.  Most noticable in the battle sequences (and there are a LOT of those), character movements are quick, natural, and always make sense in the surroundings.<br /><br />The story, like all \\"Final Fantasy\\" stories, is epic and world-spanning, but manages to get across a great deal of emotional depth as well.  That's where I really got swept up, after I got used to the animation -- the feeling that is put into the people in this story shows how much they meant to the makers of the film, and to those who love the characters so much.  By the end of it, I found myself feeling the same way, even though I only understood a fraction of what had come before.  If I had been so quickly swept up in it, what kind of effect would it have on those who knew the whole story?<br /><br />From what I gathered, \\"Advent Children\\" takes place about two years after the conclusion of the events in the game, with the world mostly in ruins and a sort of plague sweeping across it.  Starting with Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockhart, characters from the game are quickly re-introduced and the story takes over.  Filled with lots of action and heartfelt emotion, it's the kind of tale that defines epic storytelling on a truly grand scale, from indivudual relationships to an evil that could threaten the world, and an incredible conclusion that is both visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.<br /><br />\\"Advent Children\\" begins with a sort of dedication, white text against a black screen: \\"To all those who once loved this world, and who spent hours with their friends therein, it's time for a reunion.\\" That seems to be the overall theme expressed in the film, on of reunion. These characters are old friends who have drifted apart, reuniting once more to unite in a powerful battle.  Seeing them work together is awe-inspiring, and their sense of camaraderie is infectious.<br /><br />For fans of the series, as much as for the characters themselves, I can already see that \\"Advent Children\\" is a chance to re-unite with these characters you loved, one more time.  For people who don't know the series or the characters as well, this is a perfect introduction to why they are so well-loved by so many.they meant to the makers of the film, and to those who love the characters so much.

B000050IL0|5.0|I don't leave feedback a lot.  But this one is a conspicuous exception.  I don't care which composer you like, or a musical period, for that matter, but this is by far a must-have if you are a classical music lover.  Gould plays the entire variation set, almost for one continuous hour.  Other Gould DVDs?  Well, 30 broken minutes of Gould playing bits and pieces.  Gould recorded this in '81, only a year before he died in a stroke, so his technique and depth of this piece is simply stunning.  If you can find one, get it!  It's well worth the money.
0767834739|2.0|This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,  <br />any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this case <br />however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the <br />viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.  <br />Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)    <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />
044022165X|5.0|I very rarely give popular fiction five stars- most use are so watered down (for the masses who read 1 book a year) that it takes a little of the enjoyment out of it for me. \\"The Rainmaker\\" is definitely watered down, but it is still very enjoyable.<br /><br />  Grisham has written an EXTREMELY readable 600 page novel - in fact I finished the book in about 4 days.  He scores well with a nice mix of humor, memorable (and likeable) characters, action, and plot in a book that doesn't take itself to serously.<br /><br />  As a whole - this may not be Grisham's best novel, the legal maneuvering has been kept to a minimum, but for me hit the spot.

B000000W9Z|5.0|I can see why this wasn't a hit, but it has some legitamately moody pieces and would have to be my favorite bowie album after Station to Station just because it sounds so unreal.  After this came Earthling which sucked ass, but Outside stands as a great album and I'm Deranged and Strangers When We Meet are among Bowie's best songs.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|If you still love \\"Charlie/Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" but didn't think it needed a remake, you've got another think coming. Tim Burton, the man who took the \\"Addams Family\\" theme (\\"it's creepy and its kooky\\") and made it into an art form in both live and animated classics, has given Roald Dahl's timeless fable a faithful, yet fresh, retelling.  <br />        Johnny Depp, Burton's favorite leading man and himself the master of eccentric-loner character, won't make you forget Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka. Instead, he brings the candy man into a place called WonkaWorld. Where Wilder gave you a wink and a nod throughout, Depp- in his Marcel Marceau mask, Edwardian derby, and pretty-boy delivery- makes Willy Wonka a weird, ghostly creation that's still a magnet on the screen. In contrast, the kids- played cute and/or broadly the first time- are all down-to-earth yet put over Dahl's traits very well. Freddie Highmore (who worked with Depp in \\"Finding Neverland\\") gives Charlie a modest, English-schoolboy manner; the best of the kids is Anna Sophia Robb (\\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\"), whose Violet Beauregarde is a slightly-tacky little Southern belle with a mouthful of gum. My favorite performance, though, is by David Kelly (\\"Waking Ned Devine\\"), the grizzled Irish stage actor whose Grandpa Joe- a lovable old-timer with a delightful Irish lilt and twinkle- is priceless (dare we say Oscar-worthy?) <br />        Burton and his crew of designers, animators and costumers have an absolute field day with the movie's look. The cold gray Northern English (Northern Ohio? Northern Germany?) factory town with the Bucket's tilted, off-kilter house suddenly goes \\"Wizard of Oz\\" on us as Willy Wonka emerges from the gates and leads the group to the gaudy chocolate waterfall room. Look also for the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"-esque nut house with the (largely real) team of nut-cracking squirrels, the \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\" (with the bombastic Strauss fanfare) WonkaVision studios, and other touches that really make Depp, in particular, such a marvelously spooky-kooky guy. <br />        Did I mention the very talented Danny Elfman, that quirkiest of movie composers and a Burton partner for 20 years? This guy's one of my new heroes. Not only does he back the pre-factory sections with brooding, yet witty, music that has distinct Anglo-Russian overtones, he dips into everything from Bollywood musicals to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" for the Oompa-Loompa songs (using parts of Dahl's original poems)...and sings them with nifty '60s-style voice tricks. The \\"Augustus Gloop\\" number alone's worth the price.  <br />       Burton and writer John August worked very closely with Dahl's widow, and it shows; not only is half of the dialogue taken right from the book but they added a bio for Willy Wonka that's really in Dahl's dark-but-moral spirit. It's told in dream sequences that involve old horror-movie fave Christopher Lee as the senior Wonka, who's...an orthodontist! Take a look at the hideous brace/mask/helmet little Willy must wear, and you'll see why he's obsessed with candy. This doesn't spoil the story, but adds that dark Dr. Demento edge that's so much a part of Burton's work. (It's a wonder the kid wasn't electrocuted at 10!) <br />        Wisely, the DVD package doesn't include a feature commentary; this movie doesn't need it. The bonus disc, however, has some great stuff on it. Burton, the cast and crew are all major parts of features that cover the squirrel and Oompa-Loompa sequences; the former were both animated and real, while the latter is Deep Roy, a diminutive Anglo-Indian actor/stuntman, multiplied by dozens of CGI and/or robot duplicates. (Watch Deep wear two dozen costumes, play drums, and do disco-style dance steps!) Danny Elfman, too, has his own well-deserved feature- I mean, the guy does everything and he's very funny to boot. Even the kids' games, especially the one with the squirrels, are clever (and not so easy).  <br />        \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" may not be for the youngest audiences; the rating was unique (PG/\\"quirky situations\\"), and it's quirky, all right. Veruca does get swamped by marauding squirrels and the Wonka puppet show catches on fire...but those are Tim Burton moments, all right. Creepy and kooky indeed. If you're still a great fan of both the book and the original movie, you won't be disappointed in this one. In fact, I think it will be as popular decades from now as the Wilder version...or, dare I say, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"? Highly recommended!
B0000028RR|4.0|The fact that Zach De La Rocha's lyrics are at their awkward worst doest not change the fact that this is the most musically inspired album that RATM released, and certainly the best rap-rock record ever made. No matter how you slice it, \\"Take the Power Back\\" is the funkiest song about eurocentric school-teaching ever put to pen. A must for anyone disappointed with Audioslave's muzzling of Tom Morello's inimitable guitar.
B000002KCC|5.0|More then Harvest, more then Zuma,After The Gold Rush or all three together, Tonights The Night is the album that even after all these years with each listen gets better and better and better. Harvest's magic has faded and sounds outdated, Zuma still rocks hard but now falls short, After The Gold Rush is beautiful but lost some sparkle. Tonights The Night is the Neil Young Album for me. Its the one that with all the drugs and booze being passed around during the record still managed to come out an amazing piece of art!<br /><br />At first listen I thought well this is a pretty good album, and a really good Neil Young album. Then I listened to it again and thought wow this is a great album and an amazing Neil Young album! Ever since I first started listening to this album I felt it was Neil Youngs best and most pure. No super glossy production, no overly excessive noise just a honost album.<br /><br />Some complain about Neils shotty voice in certain spots on the album but I think it adds to the authenticity of the music and what Neil and the band was going through at the time and it shines bright through the music especially on songs like 'Roll A Number' and the title track 'Tonights The Night.' Though some instruments may be slightly out of tune but the music still sounds great, I mean listen to Aerosmith's 'Mama Kin' the guitar solo is flat and we still love it!<br /><br />For me personally if you want the best Neil has to offer then look no further then Tonights The Night because this is the album. This is the one that gets the job done, the beautiful lyrics and ballads, the nice folk songs, the angry rockers, its all here and there is really nothing like this album. Harvest was good but it doesnt hold a candle to Tonights The Night thats for sure!

I DON'T CLAIM IT WOULD BE EASY TO WRITE A BOOK OF THS MAGNITUDE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND MY RESPECT FOR HIS ABILITY HASN'T CHANGED, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY HE COULD HAVE GIVEN US A MUCH BETTER STORY THEN HE DID.

B00095MLGC|5.0|I've been listening to PT for several years now, and have found their music most moving.  I really wouldn't care if they sound like Pink Floyd, or whomever.  I don't believe that Steven Wilson sits around trying to imitate one group or another.  I think it could be said that most artists have their influences from many sources, from many inspirations.  So, thank you Steven for re-issuing this CD, and adding such quality and care to the songs.  I believe you will influence many other future artists with your creativity.  You certainly influence me to listen and enjoy.  After all, my son and I travelled over 150 miles, one way, just to see PT in Michigan, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the concert.
0307276902|2.0|I honestly don't understand what all the hoopla is about.  This is a garden-variety rehab story.  I guess those who are bowled over by it probably don't get out much: tons of people either know someone who went through rehab or experienced rehab themselves.  In addition, Frey's self-conscious, repetitive, and pretentious writing style prevents any chance it might have of being considered great literary drama. <br /> <br />James Frey is very luck Oprah jumped on his bandwagon.  Otherwise, this book would be a prime candidate for the remander bins at one's favorite local or online bookstore.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance is SUCH a great band! They have SUCH a unique style. It's a Good Charlotte, take away the poser, take away the Hilary Duff (UGGGGGGH), and add punk, then you get MCR. The genre has a bit of pop in it, and that's OK, because they admit it, unlike OTHER bands (cough, GREEN DAY, cough) that call themselves ALTERNATIVE. I have read an interview where Gerard Way states \\"I'm not okay is a pop song.\\" NOT A POSER. My Chemical Romance is not for losers who don't do their reseach and worship Hilary Duff. Thank you.

B00005JNTX|4.0|Wow. 'Sin City' is an uncompromising, no-holds barred, in your face, brutal, raw, and savage cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions. This is an instant classic, but be warned, it's not for the faint of heart or those who lack intestinal fortitude.<br /><br />I was blown away by the look and feel of this movie. It's so dark and gritty that one can practically taste the blood and evil that oozes off the screen. The characters, heroes and villains and alike were seriously hardcore, and so real their presence was undeniable. What I particularly liked was that the heroes were more like anti-heroes, Marv in particular, whose character traits were morally ambiguous although ultimately one of the quintessential good guys.<br /><br />My hats off to Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino for pouring their heart and soul into this incredible realization of a complex and unique tale of the classic good vs. evil. Their passion for film making shows and combined with the incredible cast as well as the comic book look, they've revolutionized film making forever by combining heretofore unused styles and concepts. They took a risk by going all out as far as violence, nudity and atmosphere goes, and it paid off, big time. I can't emphasize how thrilled I am that a movie is finally made the way it was MEANT to be, rather than trying to appeal to a certain demographic, or trying to be mainstream.<br /><br />The film was quite different than I expected it to be, definitely far more violent, but it's still an experience unlike any other. Escapism at its best because it transports the audience from reality into a whole other world that is frighteningly alot like our own in many ways. A parallel world in a sense, but where the sins of mankind are put in a rather clear perspective. I liked the plot element of the church and government represented as these evil entities and what measures and ideologies that both institutions condone and sometimes embrace wholly. Granted it was extreme symbolism but not too far from the truth in terms of principle, and by juxtaposing those horrible sins of society to the backdrop of a primarily black and white existence, humanity's corruption is highlighted and contrasted, ultimately raising awareness as to how morally bankrupt our own world is, primarily on the level of men in power.<br /><br />I have seen two different half hour specials on the behind the scenes making of 'Sin City' which provides interviews with most of the cast as well as the directors and others involved with the project. It's obvious that the directors produced a labor of love, and the cast were immersed in their parts and totally dedicated to realizing Frank Miller's dream. As Miller said himself, this film is a dream come true.<br /><br />About the only thing I didn't like about the film was Bruce Willis' character's ending. To me that contradicted his gumption and integrity, and really didn't make too much sense.<br /><br />That aside, the film is brilliant on all levels. For once CGI was used properly and complemented the story and characters rather than becoming the focal point. I enjoyed the humor in this film, and it was nice with some comic relief in such a dark and disturbing setting. If you're a fan of action films and comic books set to a solid, deep story, by all means see this film.eme symbolism but not too far from the truth in terms of principle, and by juxtaposing those horrible sins of society to the backdrop of a primarily black and white existence, humanity's corruption is highlighted and contrasted, ultimately raising awareness as to how morally bankrupt our own world is, primarily on the level of men in power. <br /> <br />I have seen two different half hour specials on the behind the scenes making of 'Sin City' which provides interviews with most of the cast as well as the directors and others involved with the project.

B0006A9FMI|2.0|Well, I finally saw 'Ghost In the Shell 2: Innocence', and I'm sad to say that I'm dissappointed by its development. The story tries too hard to tackle existential questions, primarily by quoting several famous philosophers at random intervals that simply seemed out of place, out of context.<br /><br />I got the impression that the writer and director was trying to cram as many philosophical musings into the movie as possible, rather than trying to have substantial, meaningful and relevant dialogue that would have been pertitent to the story's depth and growth.<br /><br />We learned virtually nothing more about our two favorite heroes from the original classic, and instead we merely got three vessels for existentialist meanderings intertwined with some decent yet completely contrasting action sequences.<br /><br />The visuals combining traditional hand drawn art with CGI were quite stunning, without a doubt some of the best aesthetics I've ever seen in an anime, rivaling that of 'Blood: The Last Vampire'. About the only complaint that I have with the art is not the quality but rather the content since the writer/director chose to go with a film noir style as opposed to the neo-cyber look of a futuristic society that was portrayed in the first film, which better suited the theme.<br /><br />As a stand alone film, it really does not work all that well since one would have to have intimate knowledge of the first film to have even the slightest clue as to what in the world was going on, and even then it'd be a little confusing to the most devout anime' fan.<br /><br />If the intent of the film was to develop a surreal, confusing and perplex movie, than it succeeded in all avenues, but if the intent was to further expand the awesome storyline of the original while fleshing out the protagonists, then it failed miserably.<br /><br />Truth be told, I was bored by this movie and I could care less about what was going on, which is a complete turn around from the first movie.<br /><br />If I had to compare this sequel to anything, it'd be the Matrix sequels, since they were superfluous movies that never needed to be made in the first place, since the original film was outstanding by itself and the story was sufficient and perfect enough as it concluded with a somewhat open ended story that left just enough to titilate our curious and hungry imaginations.<br /><br />I hope Oshii has learned that classics are better left untouched, much like 'The Crow', 'Vampire Hunter D', and 'Ninja Scroll', just to name a few. Mess with perfection and its likely to fall far short of expectations.irst movie. <br /> <br />If I had to compare this sequel to anything, it'd be the Matrix sequels, since they were superfluous movies that never needed to be made in the first place, since the original film was outstanding by itself and the story was sufficient and perfect enough as it concluded with a somewhat open ended story that left just enough to titilate our curious and hungry imaginations. <br /> <br />I hope Oshii has learned that classics are better left untouched, much like 'The Crow', 'Vampire Hunter D', and 'Ninja Scroll', just to name a few.

0780020685|2.0|I heard a lot of great things about this Japanese movie made back in the early 1950's, and it's often cited as a source of inspiration for modern legends, like Scorcese, Lucas, Spielberg and so on. On imdb it somehow managed to get rated as the 5th best movie of all time. All I can say is what a bunch of bogus, over-hyped, pretentious nonsense. I rented it several months ago, and I can safely say that I've seen few films as incredibly long, boring, and just plain uninteresting to the point where I really didn't care what happened to anyone in the film.<br /><br />The direction by Kurosawa is supposed to be legendary, like that of Orson Wells in 'Citizen Kane', and rather \\"groundbreaking\\", but it just isn't true. In fact I'd say that the directing was rather subpar throughout the film, especially with the battle sequences that were totally chaotic and one couldn't make heads from tales in regards to what was going on. The few battle scenes that were easy to observe were quite unimpressive and the samurai as well as the bandits seemed amateurish at best. The humor is obviously a cultural thing, because I really didn't find almost any of it funny at all. Apparently people acting all crazy, jumping around and doing dumb things is hilarious in Japan. They certainly didn't act how I would imagine that a samurai would act.<br /><br />The acting was not engaging nor was it very believable, but rather to the contrary. Most of the actors and actresses over-acted to the point where it was just ludicrous, like a broadway play which is purely for show.<br /><br />After I saw the movie I read several of the reviews and comments on the message boards at the Internet Movie Database about this film, and most of the positive reviews there were just pretentious, fake and \\"artistic\\" reviews, simply because they're reading into all these things that really aren't evident at all, unless they heard it from some hoity toity film critic.  A truly great film should stand on its own merits and not because of what a director attempted to portray or because of some cryptic significance that one could only know by either interviewing the director, screen writer or any other professional who was involved with the making of this film.<br /><br />I honestly think that most of the people that really enjoy this film, and I truly mean worship the ground that it walks on, are just people jumping on the bandwagon to be considered true film connoisseurs. This film is so highly touted as being the best thing since sliced bread that people automatically assume it is great simply because it's been said so by so many professional film critics.<br /><br />The only main reason I can see why this film is as important to the film industry as it is claimed to be is that Japan needed something to believe in after they lost the war in WW2. Post WW2 Japan went through a lot of turmoil such as the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, losing face as they surrendered to the allies, and they needed some kind of solace to help bring them out of their cultural depression, which they found in the film 'Seven Samurai'. It was a very humanistic approach to \\"the people\\", and the heroes symbolized the saviors of the Japanese people, so it's understandable that people clung to that concept, and that profoundly moved the people as a whole. Never underestimate the power of morale that a medium such as film can have on the masses, especially during traumatic and difficult times.<br /><br />From a purely objective and critical point of view, the film lacks character development, plausability, good acting, virtually no continuity as scenes and characters were all over the map, not to mention that the villains were so pathetic that they weren't scary, intimidating or anything other than laughable due to their incompetency. The supposed legendary samurai weren't much better, and they were the backbone of the film. Without good protagonists and antagonists, there isn't really much to relate to orengage with, so one ends not caring at all how the story goes. It drags on for about 3 and 1/2 hours, while it could have been cut down to 1 1/2 hour and still been too long. Lots of pointless, irrelevant down time that just dragged without adding anything remotely worthwhile to the plot. There was some kind of a romance between a young samurai and a local village woman, but it was rushed, lacked chemistry and wasn't fleshed out enough to be considered any kind of great romance. The cinematography was rather average and as mentioned pretty bad during the battle scenes. I suppose given the limitations of Japan's film technology at the time, it is to be commended for what it managed to accomplish with what little they have, but that still doesn't equal some great masterpiece as so many people falsely claim it to be.<br /><br />Another thing it claimed to bring to cinema is the concept of a gang of heroes, and while that may be true, so what? The story did inspire 'The Maginificent Seven', which was far better by the way, and many other movies with a similar basic plot, but beyond that the quality of the film itself doesn't really inspire greatness.  Just because this film inspired greatness, that does not make it greatness by default.<br /><br />I give the film 2 stars for a solid and original premise and decent production values but it cannot receive any more praise because it fails to deliver on the most important aspects of what makes an excellent, timeless film.

0553801503|2.0|Rather echoing Ross Blackman's review, I will just say that the literary diarrhea that has afflicted Martin in this volume will probably cause me to skip the rest of his series.  Having woven the rich tapestry of characters, families and locales that made the first 3 volumes so satisfying to read, Martin should have begun to consolidate and resolve the myriad storylines.  He could even have changed narrative voice to provide variety to what is becoming a monotonous device of switching from one character's story to another.  In this book, it feels like one is condemned to watch an endless series of late night reruns with someone changing the channel every 5 minutes. <br /> <br />Wake up, Mr. Martin, before you ruin both the story and your repuration.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I saw this film on Sunday, and I left the theater feeling mostly pleased with what I had witnessed. The movie is a bit of a mixed blessing though, because despite the direction in which the writer and director decided to steer this series in, which was a very promising and likeable concept, it still fell short of expections and didn't quite live up to the hype for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The acting was good, and the cast was perfect, I mean it has the cream of the crop of actors so that couldn't have been better. Honestly, who can complain with the likes of Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Christian Bale and Michael Caine? It just doesn't get much better than that, folks. Unfortunately, the primary problem with the film was that it felt rushed and I didn't really notice a great deal of character development, nor was the plot itself all that fleshed out. For example, as many may have seen in the trailers of Bruce Wayne's training, that was more or less the extent of his training in the film. I was under the impression that the director would expound upon those principles to a greater degree in the film, but rather I was treated to a mere glimpse, much like the trailer, into Wayne's actual transformation from the billionaire playboy to the dark and brooding, masked crusader of justice. Where was the in depth martial arts training, the focus on ninjitsu, the impartment of Asian wisdom, the meditation and devotion to the cause of fighting evil and upholding the balance of good and evil? I felt robbed of what was promised to be an unparalled, unique and enriching experience of the real Batman.<br /><br />Having said that, what I did like was the more realistic and plausible approach towards his gear and high tech gadgets, as well as his training obviously, however limited in scope that it was.<br /><br />The villains were a little disappointing this time around, which is another major distraction from the overall enjoyment of this film. Was the Scarecrow well made? Yes, I like the effects, not too over the top, and he seemed a little scary but he wasn't quite as effective and disturbing as let's say Nicholson's Joker or pathetic and loathsome as Devito's Penguin. He didn't have enough screen time to make a big impression, nor did his evildoer counterparts, like the mob boss or the main antagonist.<br /><br />As for the special effects in general, I thought it was competent, since the producers did not get carried away with CGI and superfluous aesthetics which is far too common these days, which is evident with such films as 'Van Helsing', '13 Ghosts' and so on.<br /><br />I was fond of the romance between Wayne and the assistant D.A. played by Katie Holmes. Their chemistry was not off the charts and in your face, but it worked, and it seemed believable unlike certain unmentionable on-screen romances that have plagued prequels in recent years.<br /><br />All things considered, I think the story was a little above average with awesome concepts but flawed execution, as in too brief and rushed. I'm thinking that they cut out many crucial scenes much like Jackson did with the LOTR trilogy, just for the reason of being able to sell millions more DVDs than the regular theatrical version would. I'm positive that there will be an uncut, unrated director's cut with extras up the wazoo, but quite frankly I find this trend inexusable, since the theater version should be the ultimate and final version of the film, because first impressions count the most, and it's the version that the majority of viewers will be familiar with from the start.<br /><br />It's kind of sad to see such wasted potential though, since many of these legendary actors did not really get the chance to show off their acting skills to a great extent.<br /><br />As a whole, I recommend the film for trying something original and taking the road less traveled, but I cannot accept all the missed opportunities for greatness that were there for thetaking. That I blame on the writer(s) as well as the director, perhaps some of the producers as well. Nonetheless, it is worth seeing, and I'm glad to say that it is way better than the last two Batman incarnations, but not any greater than Tim Burton's first two films.<br /><br />Final grade is 4/5 stars, since it is above average but nothing memorable or classic. Hollywood, good try but you can do better.e there for the taking. That I blame on the writer(s) as well as the director, perhaps some of the producers as well.

6305736650|5.0|Casablanca: easy to enter, harder to leave...especially when the ending of this 1942 classic leaves you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.  With a great story and an all-star cast, including such famed actors as Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Heinreid, it isn't a surprise that viewers wouldn't want this romance to end.<br /><br />Casablanca tells the story of Victor Lazlo (Paul Heinreid), who is escaping the Nazis and trying to get to America with his wife,Ilsa.  They end up in Casablanca, a town in the country of Morrocco.  While there, they cross paths with Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an American who owns the popular restaurant Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain.  However, Rick isn't too happy to see them...especially Ilsa, the ex-lover who broke his heart.  Rick is one who doesn't stick his neck out for anyone, but now he must make a difficult decision...should he stay with Ilsa, or help her escape with her husband?<br /><br />This magnificent love story is unlike any other.  It was rated by the American Film Institute as being the best romance movie of all time.  It is also one of my personal favorites, and a movie that I would highly recommend you see if you haven't.<br /><br />Casablanca also contains tons of memorable scenes and quotes that really make it a treasure, and cause the movie to be remembered forever.<br /><br />\\"Here's looking at you, kid.\\"
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Keep in mind it is a sci-fi film with a mix of futuristic technology and nostalgia/Americana, hence the premise allows for non-sensical action sequences just like Indiana Jones and other such adventure films, which it is being likened to.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm dissappointed by its execution. It isn't a terrible movie, but it isn't that great either.<br /><br />However, I will mark it below average because the movie OBVIOUSLY stole most of its story from the legendary Miyazaki's 'Laputa: Castle In the Sky', one of the greatest anime classics of all time. The sky pirates, the air balloons, the floating air fortress, the secret island with lush vegatation, the giant robots, the robots with the telescopic/flexible arms, etc., it was all literally plagiarized from 'Laputa: Castle In the Sky' or just 'Castle In the Sky', which was re-released by Disney last year here in the USA.<br /><br />The makers of this movie should be sued for copyright infringement because they stole the ideas from the brilliant Miyazaki.<br /><br />Aside from that, the movie is visually breath taking and stunning from beginning to end. If one is into aesthetically pleasing images, this is the movie to watch, but if one is into films with solid, complex characters and a well woven tale of intrigue and adventure, this movie falls short on all accounts.  It's worth watching once, but the story and its entertainment will wear thin after that.
630460291X|1.0|I love this movie, but have refrained from buying the dvd for one reason:  YOU HAVE TO FLIP THE DVD OVER!   <br /> <br />That's right - the movie is on both sides of the disc, and halfway through the movie you have to get up and flip the disc over.  This is an unnecessary inconvenience that ruins the experience of the movie.
B000AY74OG|4.0|We went to see this movie & our 6 year old & 3 year old & my husband & I were cracking up!!! Sometimes me & my husband were laughing harder then the kids. there are funny parts for the kids & funny parts for the adult too. I will deff buy the movie. this is a keeper.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Constantine is a fun movie with creative special effects and a great soundtrack.  Apart from a few of the props being a bit hokey, this movie was one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a long time.  If you have an interest in the supernatural and also love a good action movie, you should watch Constantine.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I just saw this film thanks to a bootleg (cough) from a realtive, and I must say this movie is AMAZING! The storyline, music, return of some old friends and new enemies...it really was well worth the wait. Keep in mind though that you do need to watch this a few times to understand certain elements of the story better (or just to see what's in those flashes that occur throughout) as this is meant to be an interactive experience. Fans of Final Fantasy 7 will greatly enjoy this, and even those who haven't played the game will find themseleves intrigued with what'll happen next. ^_^<br /><br />Although I had some questions towards AC's end (due to the film's ending), I was very excited to see how Cloud and company dealt with this new threat.<br /><br />Please support Advent Children when it's finally released in the states and don't forget to watch the ending credits! ^_~
B000001ELB|3.0|This collection must have seemed like an odd release at the time, but the band's timing couldn't have been better.     This disc covers the band's output from 1974 though 1977, or roughly from the self-titled debut through Love Gun. Indeed, this was released when the band was at the height of its popularity, so it may have seemed premature back in 1978, but the timing couldn't have been better.    Why? This thing captures the sound of the band at its peak. In 1978, the band released all those solo albums, and that whole project turned out to be a disaster.     Three pretty bad albums followed the solo discs (Dynasty, Music from the Elder and Unmasked), and that hurt the band's popularity even more.     And, of course, KISS lost drummer Peter Criss and lead guitarist Ace Frehley when the group's popularity started to wane, and that just made matters worse.    So, Double Platinum comes across as a listing of the best tracks from the band's \\"makeup years.\\" The 20 tracks on here reveal one thing clearly -- KISS was a hard rock band that could write some catchy guitar hooks that grabbed the listener instantly.     Whether one loves or hates KISS, it's hard to deny the band knew how to pump out tons of songs that people wanted to hear. Sure, all the theatrics were overblown and the band sang about a lot of sleazy stuff (you'd think the boys in KISS had sex every waking hour if you took their lyrics too seriously), but KISS built a sound that was hard to hate.    Naturally, all of the elements that made KISS a huge act are on this disc. This is all mid-tempo, grinding, guitar-based rock with hedonistic lyrics and plenty of swagger.     The whole 1970s notion of \\"it's okay if it feels all right\\" is captured perfectly on this album full of songs about chasing women, partying and raising hell. While those themes seem a bit worn out by now, they seemed fresh enough at the time, and the songs here made the band famous.    Now, there are some drawbacks to the album. First of all, the band redid \\"Strutter,\\" which was on the band's debut. There's absolutely no reason in the world to have \\"Strutter '78\\" when the original would have been just fine.     Second, the big breakout hit for KISS was the version of \\"Rock and Roll all Nite\\" from Kiss Alive! Rather than use that version here, though, we've got a copy of the studio track from Dressed to Kill.     While that's a fine version, why not use the one that got the most play on the radio? That doesn't make sense to me.  Third, there are some \\"radio edits\\" here.     That is to say, some songs were scaled down a bit and given some extra effects for the radio. That's particularly noticeable on \\"Calling Dr. Love,\\" which has some weird, backward guitar effects tossed in and a clumsy edit near the end of the song that was done to make it shorter.     \\"Detroit Rock City\\" lacks the bit at the front that establishes the track as one about a doomed fellow going to a rock show (anyone with a copy of Destroyer knows what I'm talking about here -- all the sound effects and dialogue from a \\"newscast\\" about the car crash are gone).    Finally, Love Gun is considered by many to be the best album from the band. Only the title track is on this collection, and that's a shame. Where's \\"Shock Me\\" and \\"Christine Sixteen?\\" Those two tracks are some of the best known from KISS, and it seems that at least one of them should have been included.     Having said that, this disc will give someone a good overview of the band when it was at the top of its game. Here are the songs on the disc:    1. Strutter '78   2. Do You Love Me   3. Hard Luck Woman   4. Calling Dr. Love   5. Let Me Go, Rock 'N Roll   6. Love Gun   7. God Of Thunder   8. Firehouse   9. Hotter Than Hell   10. I Want You   11. Deuce   12. 100,000 Years   13. Detroit Rock City   14. Rock Bottom (Intro) / She   15. Rock And Roll All Nite   16. Beth   17. Makin' Love   18. C'Mon And Love Me   19. Cold Gin   20. Black Diamond
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great is a very interesting exploration of corporate evolution. Jim Collins set out to attempt to understand the process of transformation that causes some companies to transition to much higher levels of performance than they have historically evidenced, and to sustain a level of results that significantly outperforms both comparative companies and the market in general.<br /><br />The author and his research team were rigorous in setting aside preconceived notions of the variables that might account for such cases of radical change. The only characteristics they looked for to identify the subject companies were seemingly sudden performance breakthroughs that were sustained for at least fifteen years. These organizations were compared to each other as well as to a set of comparison companies (those with significant shared characteristics with the exception of performance breakthrough).<br /><br />The high performance variables that were identified by the study were those that good to great companies had in common with one another, but not with the group of comparison companies.<br /><br />The characteristics that set these companies apart are not at all what one might have anticipated, and therein lies much of the interest of the research.<br /><br />How might the book itself have transitioned to greatness? I wish Collins would have included more analysis as to how the factors he identified resulted in the documented performance breakthroughs. This would have provided the reader with more content for application and in so doing would have moved Good to Great from very good to great.
B00005JNJV|4.0|The new Batman movie, the first since Joel Schumacher ruined the franchise eight years ago, can basically be divided into two separate movies. The first part plays out almost like an episode of Lost, unfortunately of the second season variety, where Bruce Wayne finds himself in the Himalaya region where he is recruited by, Henri Ducard played by Liam Neeson in full Qui-Gon Jinn mode with Wayne as his apprentice, to join his League of Shadows. And the training sessions, with its clichd metaphors, are peppered with a younger Bruce Wayne, showing what in his life led him to this point. These flashbacks also lead to some revisionist flashbacks most notable that The Joker was not the one who killed Wayne's parents nor did the killer even mutter the phrase, \\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\\" <br /> <br />The first act is saved by the closing fight sequence between Wayne and the villain of the first half of the film, Ra's Al Ghul played by Ken Watanabe from The Last Samurai. It seems as if Ken was cast solely for the fight sequence because his role is quite limited in the movie. <br /> <br />After his exile in Tibet, Wayne finally arrives back in Gotham to start the second act. It starts out slowly as Wanye starts to create his Batman alter ego with Batsuit, which we don't get to see until an hour into the movie, and Batmobile, which is now a tank rather than the classic sports car from past incarnations of the franchise. The villain of the second act is one of my favorite from the Batman mythology, the Scarecrow, second after the Penguin. But much like how the ruined the Penguin in Batman Returns, the Scarecrow is usually seen as his alter ego, Dr. Jonathan Crane, both played by Cillian Murphy, no relation tom Eddie or Charlie, and his only rarely puts the mask on. And when he permanently turns into the Scarecrow, he only makes a small cameo in the final epic battle. <br /> <br />In the final battle, they tie in both first and second acts well including a plot twist that I never saw coming. The acting is top notch, but that happens when your supporting cast includes Neeson, Watanabe, Micheal Caine as Alfred, Morgan Feeman as scientist Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as not quite yet Commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale, who I will always remember as the title character from American Psycho, is Bruce Wayne, which he does a good job at. But, like his predecessors, I really don't think he does a god job as Batman. Katie Holmes, most known as Tom Cruise's latest promotional tool, plays the token love interest who, like all of Batman's love interest not named Catwoman, is one-dimentional.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Cause We Ended As Lovers.  You may want to check out Cheili Minucci's version of the same song.  If you can find a better guitar instrumental, let me know.  Other great albums for the guitarist would be Joe Pass Virtuoso and George Bensons Breezin    Without a doubt, Jeff Beck's Blow by Blow is one of the finest jazz fusion, blues, contemporary rock instrumentals of all times - a must have for all guitarist.

B000AP04FG|2.0|Lots of action, little to no plot lead to an action packed stunt filled not so good of movie. <br />Mediocre. Far too much unstylish gun plays, and the fist fight between Pitt and Jolie was not so stimulating. They are supposed to be the world's top assasins, and they fought more like amateurs. Don't even want to compare those fight scenes to some of the better Hong Kong action thrillers or even James Bond or Charlie's Angels had more graceful looking action choregraphy. The massive explsion of the house, and the highway chase scene were relatively impressive. They should have done more high-tech stunts like the one when Jolie escapes from the window of a high rise building. Perhaps the director didn't want to put his stars through any heavy-duty stunts since it's not a serious action movie to begin with.  <br />
B000BDJ62O|4.0|This is a great and only compilation currently of Kate's work that covers her first 5 studio albums.  The mini-lp sleeve packaging is excellent except that the sound levels are a little soft as this recording has not been remastered.  Still, the quality isn't all that bad and I've found that raising the volume levels a little does not distort the overall sound quality that much and so if you are not too hung up on sound quality like I am, then this is quite a good buy.  However, if you already have the 1986 version, unless you really need to have the mini-lp sleeve, then as this isn't remastered, you may want to get the remastered versions that are out there instead of paying so much more for basically the same sound quality.

B000002Q88|4.0|Along with \\"Power\\", many regularly forget this album exists.  It's unfortunate, because there is some quality music here.  Oddly enough, Steve Walsh lists this album as his favourite Kansas album. <br /> <br />The \\"concept\\" story of this album (the ghost town of Neosho Falls, Kansas) is usually what is noted, but actually only a few songs (\\"Ghosts\\", \\"One Big Sky\\", \\"The Preacher\\", \\"Rainmaker\\" and maybe \\"The Bells of Saint James\\") deal directly with the concept. <br /> <br />Like \\"Power\\" before it, the trademark Robby Steinhardt Kansas violin is not there, though violinist David Ragsdale would tour with the band, along with keyboardist Greg Robert (Steve Walsh plays most of the keyboards on the album).  Steve Morse is still in the band on this album and very prominent.  I wonder what Richard Williams, a fine guitarist in his own right, played here? <br /> <br />Canadian super-producer Bob Ezrin (KISS, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd) produced the album and consequently it is very slick, with harmonies and a big drum sound typical of the late '80s.  Parts of the album do sound dated, but not unreasonably so. <br /> <br />However, it is a good, high-quality album and one I listen to regularly.  It's just not typical Kansas. <br /> <br />If one sets aside the \\"concept\\", the songs mostly stand strongly on their own.  \\"House on Fire\\" is the hardest rocker here, the guitar/organ interplay sounding a bit like Deep Purple.  The highlight for me is the soaring closer, \\"The Bells of Saint James\\". <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of clunkers here, too.  \\"I Counted On Love\\" and \\"Stand Beside Me\\" sound too tailor-made for the radio format of the era. <br /> <br />I'd definitely recommend this, but not as a first introduction to Kansas.  Get \\"The Ultimate Kansas\\" to introduce yourself to the musical magic that is (was?) Kansas. <br /> <br />I was fortunate enough to see this lineup (Walsh, Williams, Morse, Ragsdale, Robert, bassist Billy Greer and founder drummer Phil Ehart)live in 1991.  Morse played an instrumental set with his own band as an opener and then played the Kansas set...a very good gig. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, not long after that, he left Kansas, saying that he didn't want to be part of a \\"rock band\\" again and wanted to focus on his instrumental solo work...only to later replace (the irreplaceable) Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple!  Go figure.
B00025ETIW|2.0|Well i have to say.....this album is pure trash. Every song exept 1 have the same rythim and they all sound so similar it gets boring. Only song i can say i liked about this album is \\"The Ghost Of You\\" because of its deep lyrics and the melodies that give me chills.....even the singers voice sounds awsome when he screams. I think this is the only song that i can really appreciate the guys voice. And the beats rythim sounds so hunting......everytime i listen to it i always think of something so damn tragic....i just love the song. Other than that song the rest of the album is trash. And for everyone who thinks this is punk have no idea what they're talking about so be quiet. If you like good music that have a variety of sounds then dont buy this damn album...just download \\"The Ghost Of You\\" seriously. But if you like this kind of mtv \\"punk\\" music then you'll be happy with this trash.
B000089RVX|5.0|Most people haven't seen Evanesence before this album, I didn't until I began to search further into their past and found that they have been around for a while but more or less lurking until the time to come out was right. This album drew me in right away and that says a lot about the album if it can do that with the whole thing. I think this is strong lyrically, muiscally and passionate. The only other band I have heard of that I can compare is Lacuna Coil, an Italian band that is somewhat hidden away in America, though you can get their album. Lacuna Coil has been around a while now, but if you like Evanesence, I say check them out.  <br /> <br />Amy Lee's vocals can be anywhere from haunting to uplifting...her lyrics are the same. I reccomend this to anyone that appreciates good lyrics with good music.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Five Stars! Six Stars! Whatever is the maximum ultimate rating! When they go looking of the last great Crime Drama of the 20th Century and one of the great Crime Dramas of all time, they'll find the incredible motion picture \\"Heat\\". Film Noir in color! Michael Mann pulled out all of the stops: a fantastic film, fantastic script, fantastic directing, great music, and one of the greatest casts in motion picture history.  <br /> <br />Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, John Voight, Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Diane Venora, Danny Trejo, Kevin Gage, William Fichtner, Jeremy Piven, Hank Azaria, Xander Berkely, Henry Rollins, Natalie Portman, Tone-Loc and a great cameo by Dennis Haysbert among others. Whew, what cast! (How much was the casting budget?). Together they push this movie along in such a frenetic, mesmerizing manner that one wishes it could have gone on for hours. The film includes an incredible, spine-tingling shootout in the middle of Los Angeles that makes the OK Corral look like child's play. And the almost obligatory scene between De Niro and Pacino in the diner is a real hoot! Michael Mann outdid himself with this incredible movie of a determined group of gangsters up against an equally determined group of cops in modern day Los Angeles. Great character development and brisk plot acceleration just make it all the more BREATHTAKING. One of Hollywood's greatest films!! Five MAXIMIZED STARS!!

B000BBOUU4|1.0|I think the original is better. That's all I have to say. Johnny Depp looks totally spooky.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is a classic that is unbeatable by ANYTHING you see today in music.<br /><br />Interestingly, the quality of the Beatles' music increased as they began to fight with each other. This album contains some of the best music they ever committed to tape. You simply cannot beat the likes of Blackbird, I'm So Tired, Honey Pie, Savoy Truffle, and the other thirty tracks on this album.<br /><br />Even the tracks that most people don't consider the better of the songs on the album are, in my opinion, quite good. There really is no weak track on this album; even Revolution 9, which is an autobiographical John song, is quality.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this album. If you want to experience cream-of-the-crops Beatles material, I highly recommend this album.
B00005JO1G|5.0|This movie will make you see war in a new way. I've seen many war movies with plenty of atrocities and negative sides of war, but this<br /><br />film truly shows a unique and realistic view of war, that should make anyone reexamine their attitude towards war. I was & still am a supporter of overthrowing Saddam, but despite all the things we hear & see on TV, this film shows a more nuanced psychological perspective on war (albeit the previous one) that we rarely take into account as a society.<br /><br />Still, the story does not seek to defend either the left or right, or even to change your mind. It just shows things as they are. After seeing this movie, I'm even more convinced that the only people who should be allowed to send a country to war are those who have actually been involved in the painful realities of combat. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of your political views.<br /><br />PS - There is material in here that might be unpleasant but the \\"offensive language\\" & the rest of the things that make this movie rated \\"R\\" are a realistic view of Marine life, so I urge you to give the movie a chance even if you traditionally avoid films with language & rough content.
B000006TRV|5.0|I only had to listen to this album once or twice before it became one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />I had not previously been a Pink Floyd fan. But I previewed the tracks here on Amazon and liked what I heard. I promptly bought the album.<br /><br />There is a reason The Wall is a classic; it is one of the best concept albums ever made.<br /><br />The best thing about this album is that it makes you think while simultaneously enjoying the quality music that it has to offer.<br /><br />The listener is taken through the exploits of Pink Floyd, who, because of several factors in his life, has become alienated from the world, unable to have a real relationship with anyone. Thus, he builds himself a symbolic \\"wall\\" that shields him from the world.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this a good album is the fact that many of the tracks are not very long at all. Pink Floyd is able to tell their character Pink's story without becoming too wordy or trying to over-explain what is happening.<br /><br />The music on this album is unparalleled. Short though many of the trackss may be, they are catchy, pleasant to the ears, and high-quality.<br /><br />A must-have for anyone's music collection.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is the finest adaptation of a novel to film - no joke. It is a favorite of my entire family and whenever we have shown it to other friends and relatives, they always fall in love with this superb masterpiece. The acting and settings can not be surpassed. The five hour length is perfect to convey the nuance and subtle character and plot development. I have watched it three times and every time I am tempted to watch the entire film all the way through. After viewing it three times, I would like to comment on three aspects of the film: the character of Elizabeth Bennett, the character development of Mr. Darcy, and the benevolent and compassionate world view that undergrids Austin's work. <br /> <br />First, Elizabeth Bennett is surely one of the most likeable heroines in literature. Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth Bennett with exceptional skill - it just can't be done better than Ehle's performance. Yet it is Harold Bloom's commentary on Elizabeth Bennett that I found most refreshing and in line with my own assessment. Bloom aserts that the representation of women, especially young women, in novels prior to Pride and Prejudice, were somewhat empty headed and required direction from more worldly males, some of whom turned out to be scoundrels. Thus the innocent, flower-like young woman does not have within her head common sense and good judgement and must be guided by a man. She must rely on her elders to help her select such a man. However with Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austin creates a young woman character with as much judgement as Henry Kissinger, as much of a moral compass as Billy Graham, and all the social graces of Jackie Kennedy Onassis.  Austin blows to bits the prejudicial and demeaning view of young women as weak wisps requiring guidance. Even when Elizabeth Bennett makes a misjudgement, she is introspective and insightful enough to make a courageous mid-course correction. Her bitter rejection of Darcy's first proposal of marriage burned her rejecting words into his soul and yet through continued exposure to Darcy and the opportunity to see his true multifaceted character, she changes her perception and grows to love him. Witness her wisdom as she confronts her withdrawn father, as he hides in his study, as the youngest daughter almost brings the family to ruin through her outlandish folly and lack of maturity. Elizabeth Bennett exhibits considerable psychological strength of character and judgement. Sometimes she makes mistakes, but she is fluid enough to change her mind, to reassess, and in the end she loves a man that has grown to love her more with each passing day. Austin wrote in a time when upperclass women had to plot and scheme to marry well, since this was their entire financial and social future. Elizabeth Bennett, through her independent thinking, is above this demeaning chaos, and ends up with a man that can be her equal life partner. Elizabeth Bennett is one of my favorite people! <br /> <br />Second, the character development of Mr. Darcy is strategic, realistic, and honors the fact that as multifaceted individuals we sometimes don't look or act our best but we can all be redeemed, we can all improve. Colin Firth plays Darcy to the letter. He captures Darcy in his arrogance and pride as he undermines Jane Bennett's love interest. Firth does a wonderful job in which Darcy first proposes to Elizabeth against his own best judgement. He is shocked and dismayed and then hurt as Elizabeth rightfully puts him in his place for his insulting proposal of marriage. Darcy is also a wonderful character. A man who falls in love with a beautiful, charming and wise woman but a woman for which he must strive to become all that he can be to obtain. In the character of Darcy Jane Austin has captured the ability of love of another person to propel someone to develope into and become the absolute most they can achieve. She captures the truth that character developes not only through hardshipand perseverance but that our character develops through our loving relationships. <br /> <br />Third, in her treatment of the vast army of outrageous characters Jane Austin unfolds a moral universe. As Mr. Bennett says: \\"God has placed us on the earth to laugh at our neighbor's folly and for our neighbor to laugh at ours.\\" Jane Austin shows compassion and justice to every character, no matter how idiotic and silly, for she realizes that much in human life is idiotic, silly, and folly but also, much in human life is precious and loving and sublime. <br /> <br />I noticed that 753 people had reviewed this film before me. That alone should give you a clue that this is a classic masterpiece of drama and filmaking.  <br /> <br />
B000069KGM|4.0|A strong debut album from Chicago, back in the days when they were known as \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\". Thankfully, this was shortened to Chicago for the release of their second album. I believe that this is Chicago's best studio album (out of the two I've heard, that is).<br /><br />Lots of blaring horns, loud guitars, and soulful vocals here-sort of a rock/jazz/pop fusion thing. I'd say the best song would be the blues/jazz/rock mix of South California Purples, with some killer guitar playing and even a Beatles reference (At one point, they sing, \\"I am he is you are he is you are me and we are all together\\"). Another good song is the mostly-instrumental Poem 58, but who can forget Steve Winwood cover I'm A Man, Someday, or Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? There are a couple weaker songs (Listen, Liberation, Free Form Guitar), but most of it is excellent listening!<br /><br />Just a warning; most of these songs are very, very long. Liberation, for instance, is about fifteen minutes, Poem 58 is eight-and-a-half, Listen is nearly eight...yeah. I myself enjoy longer songs, but just to warn you, as I know people who definetily do not.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Obviously this is a movie you either get or don't.  I don't.<br /><br />I saw it with a group of people who were already into it, Pedro t-shirts and everything.  I was all setup to enjoy it, but nothing.  I may have chuckled twice.  There were a few funny bits, but for the most part I didn't laugh at the places apparently I was supposed to.<br /><br />The odd thing is that . . . neither were they!  I've seen \\"Holy Grail\\" (for example) about a thousand times, and I still bust a gut.  Don't you laugh when Marty Feldman sticks his head out the door in \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and says . . . \\"Blucher!\\".  Yet, this Pedro crowd couldn't even muster a titter at the tater tots scene, or much else for that matter.  They just kind of mechanically ticked off the bits for me, as if I was suppose to understand how great they were.<br /><br />This is a film that seems to have been deliberately made to be a cult film, and manufactured pop culture doesn't work in the long run.
B000069KE0|4.0|A great sophmore effort by Chicago, though it doesn't compare to their debut. The best songs to be found here are 25 or 6 to 4 (My personal favorite), To Be Free, Poem For the People, and the It Had Better End Soon suite.<br /><br />However, I have one major problem with this album, and that is the overly-long Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan. A twelve-part suite consisting of mostly either brief instrumental bridges or uninspired lyrics describes it quite nicely, at least in my mind. In fact, there are only four good parts of the suite; 25 or 6 to 4 (A hard, head-banging classic and, as I said, the best song to be found on the album), Now More Than Ever, To Be Free and Color My World. Even then, Color My World scores in the mid-sixes, which is another way of saying \\"Just barely good\\". The antiwar suite It Had Better End Soon is a lot stronger.<br /><br />Where's all the jamming? They should've definitely ditched most of Ballet for something along the lines of Poem 58, South California Purples, or I'm A Man from their debut album. But both Chicago and Chicago II should belong to any classic rock fan.
0553801503|4.0|It's been a long five years.    Since _A Storm of Swords_ was released in 2000, it's been long enough for fans around the world to imagine storyline resolutions, to decide how they want everything to happen over the rest of the series, and to despair of ever reading that series. It's been so long, and with so much expectation, that it would take a wizardly author to please everyone with a miraculous book. If _A Feast for Crows_ is not that book, George R.R. Martin is that author, and it's his own fault that almost nothing he could have produced after all this time would have been considered enough.    _A Storm of Swords_ ended on a knife point of prospect: Arya set sail for Braavos, leaving Sandor Clegane dying on the Trident's banks, Tyrion fled King's Landing for parts unknown, Bran trekked to the north in the company of Coldhands, and Sansa was trapped in the devious hands of Littlefinger atop the Eyrie. Danaerys, the other Lannisters, and the Ironborn were left in not much less disarray. Over its 900-plus pages, _Storm_ drove relentlessly to a breathless, brilliant finish.    _Feast_ is a quieter book, and not simply because it is missing half of the storylines in Bran, Tyrion, Dany, and Jon. Where _Storm_ raged, with river and fire and the bone-soaking rain of a dying summer, _Feast_ is the dry skittering of dead leaves. The armies that turned central Westeros into bloody mud are gone, and the soldiers and broken men that are left are going, although where, they may not know. This displacement pervades the book, even down to the chapter headings. Mr. Martin maintains the tradition of having a few central characters carry his chapters, in this case Arya, Sansa, Brienne, Jaime, Samwell, and Cersei, who thread throughout the book. However, for the first time there are single-instance headings for various of the Ironborn and Dornish: small glimpses into small characters. Even beyond this, the larger six headings are not always themselves: these people are wearing new faces or searching for them, and their paths and even names are ever-changing as they spin. Going home, or going bad, they're lost, and the way is anything but clear.    The smallness isn't limited to the size of the story or the actions: it describes the characters themselves. Most of the big players, the ones who sweep over cities and mountains, are gone, and those who are left are brought low. King's Landing enacts like a petty town council, with base men feebly waving their arms where once great ones blazed.  The Iron Islands and Dorne have no heroes either; all seem villians or possible villians.  Mr. Martin has never given us merely black-and-white characters, but there are some who embody more hope than others. Those, Bran, Jon, and Dany, are missing from this _Feast_, and we are left with the vengeful, the reluctant, and the uncertain.  There are terrible moments here, and grisly fights with words and swords, but often even the deaths are numbed, those who lived most noisily dying with a whisper, a soft story told by another, not seen for ourselves. This does not lessen their impact, but it turns us into scavengers as well, scrabbling Mr. Martin's words to us in order to take every morsel from them we can.    _Feast_ is not _Storm_, nor is it the end of the series. It is not meant to contain the rest of the story that we've been waiting for, but to continue it, which it does, in its own way. It might be easy to dismiss its wandering characters as aimless and not worth the time, certainly not the time it took for them to finally arrive. But Mr. Martin knows exactly what he is doing here, as frustrating as it may be to us. Would _Feast_ have been a different book had publishing constraints not forced him to divide the story? Of course. Possibly it might have been better, and felt as complete as the others. But on its own, it is a powerful furtherance of Mr. Martin's deeply conscious world, and it works.  We need to see the affects of these wars on the smaller people they left behind: it wouldn't be enough to paint grand strokes again. The grief of _Storm_ was drummed into us with rain and battle; the poignancy of _Feast's_ vagabonds seeps in like the creaking of a bare gray branch in a cold wind. It's not as noticeable as an axe-blow to the head, but can harry the soul just as much.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I, in all honesty, loved this film. I have never seen the stage version {I'm only 13, and my parents aren't made of money}but I have heard multiple recordings. I personally like most of the cast from the Movie Recording better. Gerard Butler has that exquisite, seductive voice needed for the Phantom. Emmy Rossum was really the only one I didn't like. IT might have been better if it wasn't so obvious she was lip syncing in the scenes. Being a music student, I know you can't sing with a big huge smile. <br /> <br />Other than that, I loved it. I especially liked how the Opera house was 'brought to life'. The scenery and stuff was amazing. It's definitely worth buying. I saw it twice in theaters, and plan on adding this to my Musical Collection when I get money.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Australia director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) has with his film \\"I, Robot\\" combined a large enough budget with a desire to tell a good story, to make an intelligent Hollywood blockbuster. Large sections of it are a CGI-driven theme ride of special effects, but unlike other big budget films like \\"van Helsing\\" or \\"Bad Boys II\\", they don't overwhelm the story, which binds them together. They complement each other.<br /><br />This story is set in 2035 Chicago. It is a familiar backdrop, because the production and design of the film acknowledges the future will also have a history. Except that although some of the stylish grey computers may look like Note Books or even iPod's, but are instead robots which will do everything from walking your dog, to chasing after you if you leave home without your asthma medicine.<br /><br />Detective Dale Spooner (Will Smith) is a man damaged in ways which aren't at first apparent to us. Returning to duty after injury, he now harbours a paranoid mistrust of robots only drawn out as the film progresses. In this Smith gets to show us he can act as well as make us laugh. This mistrust is the reason given by the holographic suicide note of robot designer Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) calls him to the crime.<br /><br />Alone in his laboratory before his death except for his robots, it doesn't take Spooner long to discover the hiding NS-5 robot Sonny (a CGI-generated character voiced by Alan Tudyk) who he is certain killed Lanning. Not believed by anyone, especially robot psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan brilliantly portraying a person relearning her emotions on the run) so begins a murder investigation that leads to the brink of robo-revolution.<br /><br />Somehow in an action thriller, Proyas has managed to retain the spirit and themes of the 1950 Isaac Asimov book on which the film is based. Asimov wasn't really interested in the mechanics of robots (he was a chemistry graduate), but instead their effect on us, as they became part of society. Sonny is the first robot able to think for itself. Although it doesn't develop a violent Terminator-like desire for self-preservation (that happens in a more Skynet like computer), Sonny is alien.<br /><br />A grittier Dark City or The Crow like film would of explored this further. But instead of ending his film with a Will Smith rap song, Proyas leaves us wondering what will happen to Sonny, and hoping for a sequel.they became part of society.

0778321606|1.0|This is a terrible read. I picked this book up because it was so highly recommended by fellow knitters. Debbie Macomber is an insult to women everywhere. Every female character was a stereotypical weak woman who for 90% of the book pined away for some \\"perfect\\" male. If you're interested in real literature and have the capacity to read above a 5th grade level, I suggest you skip this book.
B00097DXZS|5.0|I don't understand why people do not love this album, it is a great  <br />Album and just as good as Santana's last album Shaman. <br /> <br />My favorite song is Cry Baby Cry, which shows of Joss Stones great voice and Santana's great guitar skills. <br /> <br />I am only judging this album based on the music, not on the rootkit because it would get a lower score because of that, i don't like to be restricted to play on only their player. <br /> <br />5 Stars, just listen to it and you will love it too.
B0007GAERG|5.0|When I first heard this CD I knew Mariah would be a force to be reckoned with on the radio this year. <br />I love this whole CD esp. song #5 \\"Say Somethin\\",\\"Circles\\" and \\"Fly like a Bird\\".  Mariah's voice is one of the few that can take you on a rollercoaster journey that will leave you wanting another ride.  This is a great CD to buy, it's full of soulful belts, catchy club beats, sorrow, and hope.
B000AP04L0|4.0|After the hype that has been given to this release for months and months I am pretty dissapointed. <br /> <br />The title of this release is slightly misleading. What they should really call it released slightly updated edition. If you have seen or own the original DVD release of Office Space you aren't missing much.  <br /> <br />What we have here is the same transfer and audio mix as in the first DVD, no commentaries or any other extras here. I would have liked to see a slightly better transfer done for this flick. Although this is not bad, there are some issues with it, mainly in the colors. The 5.1 track is still very nice by today's standards and if one of the best mixed soundtracks I have heard on DVD.  <br /> <br />Now on to the \\"flair\\". What we have is a crappy documentary that is sorely lacking. So much more could have be done there and more information given. It seems like a waste. Instead of spending the money on that lets get everyone in the room and give us a commentary. I'd love to hear all these guys together just joking around, I read a magazine article a few months ago with them all talking about this release and that was better than what we got here. <br /> <br />The deleted scenes are nice to see, and a few give some more insight into the story. Although they mention scenes in the documentary that are not included here, which again makes little sense.  <br /> <br />And that is it. Where are the Milton shorts that were supposed to be included? You see 5 second clips in the documntary but I want to see them all.  <br /> <br />With the low pricepoint, if you don't own this yet it is worth the money. If you have the first release don't bother, you aren't missing anything.
B000002AH1|3.0|I really do.  <br /> <br />All-star lineup. Badass funk grooves. Hard rock, hard funk, hard jazz. What's not to like? Unfortunately, this is a substantially flawed album.  <br /> <br />Live-Evil's main problem is that the three or four tracks with the juiciest, funkiest grooves are just too long. Songs on Live Evil surpass the 20 minute mark more than once. And this is really just a fatal flaw, as I see it. I usually have no problem with longer songs, just so long as they are long for a reason and with purpose. Each 15-20 minute jam on Live Evil becomes repetitive after a while, and also very pointless and very self-indulgent. Tracks like What I Say and Funky Tonk would benefit greatly by being half as long.  <br /> <br />Despite the fact that the members of Miles's band were doubtlessly accomplished and talented, the solos they play are of the kind of length where it takes a really special musician to be able to sustain creativity and interest. Miles's guys just get boring after a while, and this is because of the compositions they are playing: what starts off as badass funk turns into a repetitive, boring groove, and after 20 minutes of the same bassline and chord progression, it's impossible to say anything new. <br /> <br />Look, I like this album. I don't love it by any stretch of the imagination, but I like it. In moderation. It's hard to dislike any music put out by the calibre of musicians that Miles assembled for this album - Jarrett, DeJohnette, McLaughlin, etc. I've also yet to mention the shorter pieces, those odd ditties 'Little Church', 'Selim', and 'Nem Um Talvez'. I really like these tracks; strange, trumpocentric (not a word) songs that might even be described as 'tone poems'.  <br /> <br />Live Evil is an album that had so much potential, as would any album created by Miles Davis and his typical band of legends who set out to create badass funk-rock-jazz. I wish they had fulfilled their potential on this album. I wish they had made a true classic,as they easily could have. I wish they had played for half as long.
0553801503|5.0|A Game of Thrones trickled into a Clash of Kings which roared into the crescendo that was Storm of Swords, IMHO the finest fantasy novel ever written. <br /> <br />The next book had to be slower and calmer in tone, as nobody could have continued the torrid pace of Storm of Swords for 3/4 more books into the final battle.  In Feast for Crows the characters are regrouping, forming their final alliances, and getting ready for epic finale.  This series now almost feels as though it has been split in two, with the first three books forming the first half, and the last 3/4 forming the second half, each half with their own intro, building action, and climax. <br /> <br />I enjoyed Feast for Crows greatly, although I do feel that it should have been split into two parts rather than have half the characters in each book.  It is, however, a very different book than the previous two.  In fact, it reminded me greatly of Game of Thrones in pacing and content.  I expect to see the final two books mimic Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords.

Not so friendly, or explainable creatures, known as Graboids, make a visit to Perfection Valley, where the residents have waited far too long to leave town after some strange deaths have been discovered.

The humans make a last desperate stand with high explosives and a whole lot of lasso skills to destroy the threat made by the giant underground worms.

6308627097|4.0|The only reason I bought this album originally is because I was looking for some chick rockers whom I could be inspired by.  I was not disappointed by any stretch of the imagination.  Every song has a catchy guitar riff and the lead singer's voice is infectious.  \\"Who do you dance for?\\" and \\"Hot Night Crash\\" are some of the best of the album, but I also love \\"Empty Heart.\\"  I gave this album four stars because some people might think they all sound similar, and I won't argue with that but I love their style anyway.  Get this album!
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Other bands in this category usually make me want to puke, but I have to confess that I find these freaks in Slipknot ridiculously entertaining. This live release may be the best way to experience the band's sound in all its messy ghoulishness. Slipknot's studio albums are held back by sound production that can't quite capture the horror of nine guys freaking out, and songwriting that can almost escape nu-metal confines but can't quite make the leap out of genre stereotypes. This live album is so much fun to listen to because it shows that Slipknot has the potential to jump free of their category. Guitarists Mick and James sound more crisp and creative, while you can actually hear what the electronics guys Sid and 133 are doing. Best of all, Slipknot's imposing army of percussion can be heard to its full effect, not least in the skullcrushingly sick polyrhythms of \\"The Blister Exists\\" or \\"Before I Forget.\\" These nine guys do have trouble staying together at times, and that gives this recording an embarrassing feel in a few places, especially in a disastrous take on \\"Vermilion.\\" But on the other hand, some of the band's most unique songs, like \\"Purify,\\" \\"Skin Ticket,\\" and \\"Iowa,\\" show a level of creativity and dynamics that Slipknot's peers could only dream of. While their studio discs show a troupe that is right on the verge of true greatness but isn't quite there yet, this live release shows Slipknot in all their horrifying onstage glory. And it sure is a riot to listen to. [~doomsdayer520~]
0440238609|2.0|Please note what Charles McGrath writes to illuminate Pullman's trilogy in the Magazine section of the New York Times, November 13, 2005: <br /> <br />[Lewis's greatest influence, though, is on the British fantasy writer Philip Pullman, whose \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is both a homage of sorts (it begins with a girl in a wardrobe) and also a kind of anti-Narnia, a negation of everything Lewis stood for. God in these books turns out to be a senile impostor and Christianity merely a \\"very powerful and convincing mistake.\\" <br /> <br />Pullman is an atheist and, not coincidentally, one of Lewis's fiercest critics.

B000005RQT|5.0|In the spring of 1970, Deep Purple released a milestone in the history of hard rock/heavy metal with their fourth studio album 'In Rock'. Except for the first two Black Sabbath records that sandwiched the release of this one, there was no more important lp in the history of metal then this momunment to aural destruction. This album changed the future of heavy music and defined the difference between late '60's hard rock and '70's metal. Purple's new lineup with singer Ian Gillan and bass player Roger Glover had particpated in the previous year's recording with the Royal Philharmonic so this was their debut proper with the band. And what a debut!!!! Demolishing what was an eccentric classical-psychedeilic sound into a guitar dominated sonic assault, Ritchie Blackmore effectively took musical control of the band and cemented his name among rock's guitar immortals. Highlights include the album opener \\"Speed King\\" and for some bizarre reason the opening minute and a half of the song was edited out for US release. Are you kidding me??? Thank God it's now available on this edition. The crash and burn into followed by Lord's piece set you up for the dynamics of the song and the entire record! \\"Child in Time\\" is a flawless display of virtuousity as both Gillan and Blackmore pull out all the stops. \\"Hard Lovin' Man\\", \\"Into the Fire\\", \\"Bloodsucker\\", \\"Living Wreck\\" and \\"Flight of the Rat\\" (great solo from Ian Paice!) fill an album with no filler! Seven cuts and they all count. Purple would conquer their homeland with this record and pre-release single \\"Black Night\\" which appears along with several bonus cuts on this 25th anniversary issue. Many people feel that 'Machine Head' is better but I think that's nonsense!. 'In Rock' rips your head off and stomps it into the ground! Mercy!

B0000844I8|4.0|Director Roland Emmerich has been largely been known as being an action-film director rather than an \\"auteur\\". In the same camp as Michael Bay, they make films that are not supposed to have big personal investments or even good dialogue, they're for pure entertainment value, nothing more. Before they blew up the White House in Independence Day, ruined Godzilla and froze New York, they did Stargate, an intriguing sci-fi movie which unfortunately doesn't have the greatest transfer. <br /> <br />It's 1928 and scientists in Egypt have discovered a big artifact. Flash forward to present day and scientist Daniel Jackson gets hired to decipher the artifact, a big stone tablet with markings. Taking 2 weeks he figures it out, it's a \\"stargate\\" which has the power to zip to a point in space. Also uncovered with the tablet is the actual stargate which they then open(in probably my favorite water effect since the Abyss' water tentacle) and step through. <br /> <br />On the other side, it's actually very reminiscent of ancient Egypt. They find a tribe of people who are governed by the Sun God Ra, who's looking for immortality(aren't they all?). Things get complicated when the US orders that if there's a threat that they blow up the Stargate. But of course Ra finds the bomb and coupled with the mineral he uses the tribe to mine it has an even bigger destructive power than normal. So it's basically stop Ra, save the tribe, and save Earth. Sheesh, you think aliens would attack some other planet for once. <br /> <br />It's interesting that a sci-fi movie is actually very modern looking. Besides the technology, it's very low-key. There's no big spaceships a-la Independence Day, big weaponry like Star Wars or odd creatures like Alien. That's part of its charm: it's sci-fi but it's got a bit of a distinctiveness, even though the plot isn't exactly new. You could replace the galaxy travel with time travel and you're in the same ballpark. <br /> <br />If there's one thing that's unfortunate is that the transfer is still not that good. This is the 3rd iteration of Stargate on dvd and there's still problems. For one, on occasion I noticed the image got slightly grainy. Another was there was some specks on the image, like black lines. Overall this is a better transfer than the last 2 but there's still problems. <br /> <br />Another is that there's very little features. There's a commentary and there's a featurette. Boom, that's it. Kind of like Terminator 2's DVD, one contains a great transfer but very little features while the previous one contained a boatload of features but not the greatest transfer. <br /> <br />Similar to Firefly/Serenity which mixed traditional/modern themes with sci-fi, Stargate is an underrated film that while it does have problems here and there, it's still an enjoyable film and since it's Roland, he's pretty much succeeded. Now if he can step it up a notch...
0446577383|4.0|The central characters of this group are a rag-tag foursome who camp out in tents near the White House, and collectively call themselves the Camel Club. The group spends their days compiling and seeking the truth behind various conspiracy theories. One night they witness the execution-style murder of a Secret Service agent, and are soon thrust into the middle of their own conspiracy when they are marked for death themselves. An added backdrop to this novel is the planning of an unprecedented terrorist attack on American soil.<br /><br />I tell you this book grips you right from the beginning and it is VERY difficult to put it down, even when you want to! The plot is complex and there are a myriad of characters to sift through, but  in the end it is well worth the time and effort. This is an extraordinary political thriller, great dialogue and very entertaining. Well worth the price, and may have you dreaming of your own conspiracy theories!!<br /><br />Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com

But I promise if you'll give \\"Playing the Angel\\" a chance you'll come to love it as much as I. With each listening this newest Depeche Mode release moves to the top of my list of favorites and it makes me thirst for more from a band that still has much to give. I just bet Depeche Mode will be around for many more years. I'll be waiting for more. Right now I'm listening to this great CD.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie was as amazing as it was disturbing. And that's really amazing.  The deaths were brutal but highly symbolic, and not simply distgusting and horrible atrocites. Of course, they were distgusting and wholly unjustified, but still quite meaningful and interesting. I particularly liked the murder for Pride. A beautiful model was hideously disfigured, then offered a call for help, with the knowledge that she would have to live the rest of her life ugly, or pills with which to kill herself and end her misery. Proving the killer's point, the woman chose death rather than ugliness.   Most of the murders are similarly complicated such as the murder for Avarice (greed). Though this movie moves a little slowly, it keeps the viewer's attention from the creepy and obsessively fanatic opening, to the thrilling and astonishing close. I recommend this movie for anyone interested in this genre. Not for the faint of heart (or stomach).
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This 1 song really kicks ass, Money for Nothing and probably <br />the best song on the album, and one of those best Dire Straits <br />songs ever made. Another kick ass song from Dire Straits is Heavy <br />Fuel from the On Every Street 1991, which I think is even better. <br />Both songs really kick ass. Then there are other great songs So <br />Far Away, Walk of Life, & the amazing title track. The title track is a great 80's power ballad. One of those great 80's power <br />ballads like GNR Sweet Child O' Mine, Foreigner's 3, Waiting <br />for a Girl Like You, Girl on the Moon, & I Want to Know What <br />Love Is. Dire Straits are the greatest rock and roll band of <br />all time. Every album was great from 1978-1995. Their songs really kick ass. 3 TIMES REPEAT FOR MONEY FOR NOTHING, CLASSIC <br />ALBUM.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I enjoy so many different voices and versions that bring variety to Xmas songs, and have a number of CDs (and even tapes!); but I will not be adding this one to my collection, for all that I enjoy jazz singing. So, it's Diana Krall.  I am just not enthralled or impressed by her singing. To me, this is just another of this year's overly-hyped Xmas CDs.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Everything about this dull movie is inferior to the 1960 George Pal version.  What were the filmmakers thinking?  I dare anyone to think this version is as good.
0440237688|5.0|A deep novel that makes the reader think and reflect about their own experience.  <br /> <br />I went into this novel not knowing a thing about it.  It slowly unravelled itself as I read on from chapter to chapter and found myself emotionally invested in teh characters and storyline.   <br /> <br />This is truly a gripping novel that everyone should read.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I could sit here and type for pages about how great this album is (for it really is an amazing album) but there are several more elaborate reviews you can turn to for that. Instead I am writing this in response to the reviewer who called this album \\"anti-American\\", Green Day is NOT anti-American, they are just pushing for free democracy and for listeners to actually formulate their own opinion as opposed to just listening to what the media says. Billy Joe is not saying ALL american are idiots, he just talking about those whose minds and opinions are completely controlled by outside influences. I think that if you give the record a chance and not base your opinions on one song you will be very happy with this album.
B000957O82|3.0|Hitch is a feel good movie that'd be a safe bet to watch on a first date. With its gently rolling presence, slapstick humor and decent acting, it'll tickle you without going into crudeness.<br /><br />Will Smith (MEN IN BLACK) stars as Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (aka The Date Doctor), who's sole purpose is to help loser guys gain access to the love of their lives. Hitch does this by training men to behave on dates and how to handle women in the early stages of a relationship. But when a CPA named Albert (Kevin James, THE KING OF QUEENS) comes to Hitch with a serious crush on a famous and wealthy woman his company works for, things spiral out of control ...for Hitch, that is.<br /><br />HITCH takes a look at relationships through both genders' eyes as Will Smith's character meets up with Sara (Eva Mendes, TRAINING DAY), a gossip columnist for a local New York newspaper. Hitch has met his match and is forced to delve deeper into a nurturing relationship than he'd ever planned.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************<br /><br />Although the acting was good and the film didn't lag, it also was predictable and smaltzy. I knew what was going to happen in the film's finale ten minutes after it started.<br /><br />So sit down and enjoy it during a first date, but don't expect any intellectual stimulation to get the ...uh ...juices flowing. Cerebral juices that is!
B000000OQF|5.0|This album and this band singlehandly changed my life forever.  I was probably 13 or 14 when I discovered Guns N'Roses.  Once I discovered them I just want to be like them.  Drinking, smoking, being a tattooed millionaire, living in a masion, and screwing supermodels.  That was it!  That's maybe what life is all about?  There were my heroes and their still my heroes.  I still the sixth member of the original GN'R lineup.<br /><br />As mentioned above, this album is more of a symbol than a masterpiece.  Since The Rolling Stones and Sex Pistols, these guys were the ultimate bad boys of rock n'roll.  They created a new era.  But unfortunately for millions of fans across the world it was too good to be true.  The band didn't survive to his own fame, Axl' gigantic ego, and abuses of all kind.  It was sad, the new Rolling Stones self-destruct!  What could have been the greatest band in the world became an underachieved act.  All the scam begun when original bandmate Steven Adler was fired.  It was already the beginning of the end.  Then Izzy Stardlin left and the rest is history.<br /><br />Musically speaking, &quot;Sweet Child O Mine&quot; is probably the greatest song ever write by a human being.  &quot;Paradise City&quot; is in my view the most ass-kicking anthem of all-time.  And &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; marks a sight of time.<br /><br />Buy this album and adopts GN'R philosophy.<br /><br />That's what life is all about!
B00006BGX1|5.0|Given The Who's reputation for being among the bad boys of the 60s, smashing instruments and lights and blowing up drums, who could have guessed that they would have created one of the most cohesive pieces of rock music ever, a concept album, an opera, and plain solid rock. Furthermore, the story is relatively easy to follow, with a variety of sordid elements, the details of which can be found in a host of places, and which other reviewers have detailed, so let's focus on the music.<br /><br />The music holds up well; more than well, it was well done, and remains one of my favorites. Released originally in 1969, the album had the benefit of building upon ground broken by The Beatles, among a host of others. The Beatles infused elements of classical music into rock. The Moody Blues fused classical music and rock into one. The Who raised the ante by creating a new \\"classical\\" opera using rock music.<br /><br />An example of some of the best instrumental neo-classical rock on this album is track 5, \\"Sparks,\\" which has excellent bass, is definably rock, and yet retains the complexity and flavor of a classical work, in rock music form.<br /><br />Among the other songs that are definably rock are \\"I'm Free,\\" \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me,\\" \\"Eyesight to the Blind,\\" \\"We're Not Gonna Take It,\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard.\\"<br /><br />Other songs that fill in the story that have the flavor of a traditional musical are songs like \\"It's a Boy\\" and \\"1921.\\" One song that has elements of a Beatles' song is \\"Christmas.\\"<br /><br />I'll allow the reader to categorize the other songs.  Categorizing these songs is not important. What is important is that The Who took a variety of musical elements, classical, rock, opera, and created a master work of music, music that tells the poignant story of a child abused by his mother and step-father after witnessing the murder of his father. Thrown in are classic elements of opera: infidelity, exploitation, and cowardice, along with elements explored at that time in very few works: incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse.<br /><br />Has \\"Tommy\\" dated well since 1969? I think so. The essence of the sound remains The Who, and if you know Who music at all, much of it sounds current, three decades and more after it was written. \\"Tommy\\" is no less current. Listening to the \\"The Acid Queen,\\" I hear music that some of today's artists are trying to achieve: a more basic rock sound, steering away from complex synthesizers and over-orchestrated, over-exaggerated rock sound.<br /><br />Okay, is there a drawback?  You need to listen to this album in its entirety. Some of the songs and lyrics make little sense outside the context of the album. But given that the album is an opera, it makes sense that the album needs listened to as an album. I only listen to \\"Tommy\\" as an album, and avoid selections from this album.<br /><br />\\"Tommy\\" is another of the numerous works of rock that were very experimental at the time of its release. \\"Tommy\\" succeeded in being very good rock, and broke more new ground for rock music. It has aged well, and continues to be one of my favorites. It's the Who. How could you go wrong with the Who?<br /><br />Note that this version is a Japanese import.  There are various versions of this CD with varying levels of quality and price.  You should learn what is available and the cost to be able to choose the version that is right for you.red at that time in very few works: incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse.  <br /> <br />Has \\"Tommy\\" dated well since 1969?

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It is an awesome love story about many different people.  It follows the lives of many different people in Britain during the Winter season coming up on Christmas.  You follow the lives as such people as the Prime Minister, a famous old Singer, and a english man hoping to get laid in America.  I really loved this movie and it is one of most favorite movies.  If you like a movie following the lives of many people then you will definately enjoy this great love story.
B000819PKC|5.0|A fan of 13 years like me who still melts to the sound of the Old Jamiroquai (first and second albums Emergency on Planet Earth, Return of the Space Cowboy) loves this album. It is a brilliant combination of all their work so far. I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the band went back to a more natural sound, less dance-clubish than A Funk Odyssey. I love Funk Odyssey, it is great fun, but I really love Dynamite for its diversity and the spirit throughout. Seven Days in Sunny June is the best ballad we have heard in a long time; you can taste your best summer while listening to it. Starchild is very uplifting as is Don't Give Hate a Chance which has an anthemic feel to it. A special mention to the chorus of Love Blind, a surprising jazzy melody happily trapped within rock n roll. Once again, the band is bringing us joy, energy, fun, political awareness, sexiness, and romanticism.  <br /> <br />PLEASE NOTE: this version of the album DOES NOT contain another great anthem, in the same vein as Don't Give Hate a Chance, Time Wont Wait, a fans favorite. <br />
B0000DCGT3|4.0|This was a very funny movie that I enjoyed most out of the series.  Stifler returns and is as funny as always, especially when he is trying to act like a good preppy kid for Cadence, who is Michelle's little sister.  This movie has tons of laughs from start to finish and is just an all around great movie.  It also has a great bachelor party scene that is funny and extremely hot at the same time.  This is a good movie that is sure to make you laugh a lot.
B00005RG6M|5.0|this really was an experience to hear. i've been listening to queen for many years, but when i first listened to this dvd audio, i was blown away. first because the details in all the songs it's more real, no comparison with th cd versions.and second, it seems that they have added some extra sound, you'll be turnig your head back every time to see that the sound you heard was real o came from the speakers. i have compared with the surround sound mix in Greatest hits vol 1 dvd video. although the dts 96/24 sound is quite good and the surround mixes are the same with the dvd audio. you really can tell the diference between the dvd audio and the dts 96/24 sound in the greatest hits vol 1 dvd video. the dvd audio is louder, the subwoofer works more, and the mids and highs are more real. maybe there's more diference i can't notice with my audigy 2 zs sound card and the three pair of speakers from Klipsch ProMedia Ultra 2.0. but someone with a high end reciever and speakers, will be able to notice more diferences.  the upcoming remastered cd's versions well, there's no need to compare with them.  buy it and enjoy freddie's voice as never before.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|This was the best Batman yet.  It was action packed and had a great story.  This movie was about how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman, and the first villians that he faced.  Christian Bale did an awesome job as Batman, and Michael Cane was a good and funny Alfred.  I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone that loves batman or just to anyone that loves a great action flick.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|\\"GOSH did you see that FLIPPIN SWEET movie NAPOLOEN DYNAMITE. GOSH it's so FLIPPIN SWEET. VOTE FOR PEDRO!!!\\" <br /> <br />Am I the only one who fails to see the greatness in this movie? If yes, click \\"no\\". If no, click \\"yes.\\" GOSH!
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is an awesome movie telling a nice little story.  A basic simple plot is that a kid in his senior year of highschool has been living a pretty boring life, when a girl moves in and spices up his life, adding a lot of excitement.  It is a funny movie with a hot star, Elisha Cuthbert, and is a very entertaining movie to watch with your buddies, and girls like this movie too.
B000957O82|4.0|This is one hilarious movie.  In it Will Smith is a date doctor that tries to hook up his clients with girls that they would by themselves have trouble getting either due to they are shy, not good with women or something else.  Smith's character is trying to hook up Kevin James with a rich woman that he is in love with.  It is a very funny movie in which Kevin James does a great job.  The scene where he displays his dance moves is just HILARIOUS!!!  Will Smith does a great job and has some very funny scenes too.  All in all this is a very good comedy that I would definately recommend.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The second season of the O.C. was very good.  It started out slow but midway through it really picked up and it had an AWESOME season finale.  The new characters were interesting but not that great.  Some of the stories were a bit out there but kept you wanting to watch each episode.  All in all the O.C. continues to be great and is my second favorite show next to One Tree Hill.  This is definately a must buy for any die hard O.C. fan.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This is a great movie with a star cast.  Russell Crowe does a great job playing the victim of a the tobacco industry that is trying to expose their secrets.  The makeup cast does a great job of showing how this trama affects him, as he appears to age a lot during the scandal.  Al Pacino is the producer for an acclaimed tv show that is trying to report this scandal.  The movie is very interesting and while long, it is so intriguing that you just want to keep watching it.  One of my friends that did not even like it to much kept watching it because there was just enough in the story to make him want to keep watching to see what happens.  All in all this was a great movie with great acting.
B000683VI4|4.0|This is one great love story.  It is about two different people from different social statuses that fall in love.  They spend one magical summer together, and never see each other again until a long time later.  The story is very good, and is a great movie to see with a girl.  I am male and I know of many guys that liked this movie a lot and I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good love story.
B000AMWIVM|3.0|Saw is a pretty grotesque story yet had an intriguing story.  In the movie, Jigsaw kidnaps people and sets them up in things that force them to hurt themselves in order to escape, or else they die in some way.  The story of this movie is interesting, but it is pretty disgusting to me when the characters inflict pain on themselves.  That stuff just turns me off and I was very grossed out by this.  Other then that, if you don't mind that then you should like this movie a lot as it has a good story and a lot of gore.
0307236722|5.0|Okay, Martha is someone I really don't want to like... but all of her negativity is forgiven when she delivers the goods.  Seriously, this book is complete, pretty and thorough.  A+
0515123447|5.0|I am a big fan of Barry Eisler's John Rain series.  Rain, the half-American, half Japanese, jazz-and-whisky loving assassin for hire is one of the great anti-heroes of modern fiction, and Eisler writes a fight scene and an exotic locale as well as anyone.  A friend who has also read the Rain novels recommended that I read Lee Child's Jack Reacher series:  \\"John Rain is cool jazz, and that's fine, but Reacher is Stevie Ray Vaughan, and he rocks.\\" <br /> <br />While that may have not been the most poetic reference ever, it worked.  Lee Child's \\"Killing Floor,\\" the first Jack Reacher novel, had me hooked from page one.   <br /> <br />With a minimum of exposition, Child drops Reacher and the reader pell-mell into a murder investigation on the first page, with Reacher as the defendant.  Reacher, a former Army brat and military policeman now wandering the South as a dischargee, may not be the murderer, but he sure as heck ain't innocent.  As he says, they can't prove I did it, because I hadn't killed anyone . . . in a while.   <br /> <br />The murder investigation quickly morphs into a life-or-death struggle to break an international criminal conspiracy hidden behind the bucolic streets and manicured lawns of Margrave, Georgia.  Unfortunately for the criminals, Reacher learns that he has a personal involvement in breaking this conspiracy, and Reacher is not an investigator to play nice or by the rules.  Child may rely a bit too much on coincidence to get Reacher involved (Reacher just happens to randomly pick a town to wander through in time to find himself named as the initial suspect in the murder of his brother, a talented Treasury investigator who was also trying to bust the criminal ring).  But since the coincidences are more in the set-up of the novel than the resolution, they are more or less forgiveable. <br /> <br />Reacher brings a keen mind and a brutal streak a mile wide to his investigation.  Partnering with an aging yet still hale detective and a beautiful cop, Reacher soon finds himself immersed in a conspiracy where the perpetrators use ghastly torture and murder to further their own agenda . . . including offing their own members to keep the others in line. <br /> <br />The only problem for the criminals is that Reacher may be the only person in Georgia who can take the criminals' level of violence and go one level deeper.  As a career MP, Reacher was trained to go after AWOL Rangers, Seals, and special forces guys and bring them back.  As a result, you're not going to find a more capable guy with a gun, knife, sap, or his bare hands (or other lethal body parts).  And Child gives Reacher several chances to use his training to the utmost.  These fight scenes are written very well, as are Reacher's investigation and his preparation for the fights.   <br /> <br />A complex plot offers a lot of insight into the corrupt world of international currency and counterfeiting, and while Child's characters may not offer the nuances of Tolstoy, they are a well-rounded, well-written group that generally avoids cliche.  Mercifully, Child's characters are smart enough to figure out what's going on independently, and we are generally spared those scenes where the villains tell the heroes about their criminal activities in order to fill in the gaps.  And while the setting of Margrave, Georgia, may not be as exotic as Eisler's use of Tokyo or other haunts in Southeast Asia, Child writes the South very well and gives it a haunting menace appropriate to the story.   <br /> <br />A brutal story, \\"Killing Floor\\" is nevertheless first and foremost an intelligent thriller that does not get overwhelmed by its considerable blood and violence.  The story unfolds gradually, and loops back on itself a couple of times as solid conjectures have to get reexamined in light of new facts. <br /> <br />While \\"Killing Floor\\" will never be accused of being Great Literature, it is a heck of a read and it is easy to see why so many devoted fans have checked out the on-going series.  Count me in as another reader eager to see where Reacher's wanderings will take him.
B00097DXZS|2.0|I LOVE Santana but this CD is not his best. The past two, Shaman and Supernatural, were so good I just about wore them out. This one will be dusty before it gets played again. Santana needs to get back to the scathing guitar riffs. There are some bright moments. The cuts with Michelle Branch and Joss Stone are good. But sadly this CD is way too much rap/hip-hop and merengue. Somewhere along the journey we lost Carlos Santana. Here's hoping the next CD is the real deal. I won't even get into the CD Protection. I'm just glad I found out before I tried to burn an extra copy for the car and screwed up my comnputer.
B0000029AP|1.0|No its not them its me from sampling this bull!@#$!!! I wouldnt buy this if it came with a Peurto Rican Chick that the only word she knew in English was Yes or if Bush helped the Gas Prices Go Down!!!!!!!!!!! Do Not Buy Dont Listen To YO
B000819PKC|2.0|IN comparison to the other Jamiroquai albums, this is the worst. Upon hearing that they were releasing a new album that went back to the good days of Traveling- i was like \\"PIMP!!\\" jamiroquai is my favorite band. i went and got it. listened to all the songs once through, and was satisfied with #2 and #5. the rest are...hmm..they just don't have the jamiroquai spice. looking at the credits, you'll see that there are all new members except Sola and Derrick. i think the real soul in Jamiroquai came from the keyboards and the bass. without that u just got this mish-mash of a cd that shouldn't have been released.
0385337388|1.0|This is an out-of-date, highly fictionalized account of one person's residency. While it may be titillating for some people to read, if you believe these stories, you'll believe anything.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album is classic.  Weezer just came out with an awesome debut album here that could not have been better.  \\"Say It Ain't So,\\" \\"Buddy Holly,\\" and \\"Undone (The Sweater Song)\\" were the big hits.  Nearly every Weezer fan rates this album as their favorite or second favorite Weezer album.  The songs are manic, with great harmonies.  There is not a single bad track on this album, and even though it's just 10 tracks long it feels like a full album since there is no filler.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone as the first Weezer album to buy.
B00004CWO8|3.0|After an initial viewing, I sat down and wrote a review for this and gave it five stars. It was a fascinating new look at an old warhorse of the ballet repertoire, the sound was beautiful, the acting ability of the dancers impressive. But for some reason I didn't submit that review, and now, several months and several viewings later, I find that I no longer agree with it.<br /><br />I should hasten to write that I still think the acting is very good, the music is still beautifully performed, and this is still a fascinating new interpretation of an old warhorse. But I find this version to be sort of like a flashy and abrasive new friend, and it turns out I'd prefer to spend time with my old warhorse of a friend. This performance impresses, but it just doesn't wear well.<br /><br />By now you're well aware of the plot of Bourne's reimagined Swan Lake. Young prince has overbearing and emotionally distant (but sexually vibrant) mother, the Queen. The Queen has a manipulative and ambitious secretary who sets the young prince up with a woman who will help kick the weak foundations out from under his shaky emotional equilibrium, resulting in a near breakdown for the prince. Enter the swans, who offer him a taste of freedom. Alas, that taste isn't enough to shore up his emotional edifice for long, and the secretary's son (the same dancer as the principal swan) arrives on the scene to help bring that edifice crashing down. The principal swan arrives at the end to try to save him, but the other swans are no more accepting of swan-human relations than are humans.<br /><br />This is all very interesting material, and the dancers are all very good at presenting it. Especially fine are the Queen (beautiful, icy, and passionate) and the swan (handsom, aggressive, tender, and dangerous). The swans are male, and they're danced with the aggressive grace of the real birds (real swans, if you've never gotten up close enough to interact with them, are mean and scary birds).<br /><br />So what's wrong with this production? First and foremost, there's not really very much dancing in it. It's more like a pantomime theatre production with musical accompaniment. As other reviewers have noted, Bourne's choreography is really very basic. If that doesn't bother you, add another star, but I'm traditional enough to want some serious dancing in my ballet. Second, the camera angles tend to demphasize what dancing there is. They emphasize the theatrical elements over the dance. Again, if that's what pleases you then you should read another half star into my review. It pleased me at first, but no longer.<br /><br />I think this is a performance worth watching. I just don't think it's one that bears up well to repeated viewings. It starts to seem a little more flashy and a little less substantial than it did at first. I like to see something new and flashy come along to shake up our perceptions and our prejudices, and Bourne's staging does a good job of that, but there's something to be said for old warhorses. After watching this DVD I can watch a more traditional version with new appreciation, and I'll undoubtedly pull this one out from time to time./> <br />So what's wrong with this production?

B0009S2T0M|5.0|This was an extremely difficult film to watch.  It starts off Kafkaesque, and even from the beginning it is very hard, if not impossible, to know what is fantasy and what is real.    Oh Dae-su has been inmprisoned for 15 years and he has no idea why, or who has done this to him.  Upon his release, he finds a young woman, Mi-do, who is extemely attentive to him.  The rest of the movie centers around these two people and uncovering the secrets which led them to each other, and in identifying and dealing with his nemesis.    In particular, the relationip betweeen the young woman, Mi-do, and the protagonist, Oh Dae-su, does not appear credible, but this and other happenings which appear to be unexplainable come together at the end.    The musical score is beautiful, and forms a counter-point of sorts with the violence of the film.    There is a lot of violence, and some of it is so extreme that I did not know if the violence was meant to be real, or was it a fantasy, a dream in the mind of Oh Dae-su.    While the ending ties most of the movie together, you have to have a strong stomach to get there.    This has to be one of the strangest films that I have recently seen, and although I finally came away with a sense of satisfaction with it, it is too intense, too difficult a film for me to recommend to anyone I know.
B000005IU2|5.0|This album is the pinnacle of recorded popular music. Having listened to it probably 2000+ times in it's entirety, I have yet to find an album which comes so close evoking these most humanistic of urges. What is more human than wanting to scream and shout, hit things with yr hands, wanting to feel a pounding beat deep in the pit of yr stomach?  Simply said, this album has touched something no album before it had touched, or after it has touched.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|I was so disappointed in this movie. I LOVE the movie WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. It is fantastic. I thought that this new movie would be great. I was so wrong. Where was the OOMPA LOOMPA songs? And the Oopma Loompas were not oompa loompas. They were just one \\"short\\" man. I think it was a great dis-service to release this movie. Johnny Depp was eerie. Not eccentric. Just plain strange and frightening. And what happened to the golden egg laying geese. What good are nuts? Really? The only performance I enjoyed was that of the young actor who played Charlie. I am extremely disappointed in Tim Burton. I expected more from him.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and lots of fun stuff, approved by Dahl's daughter (a producer), can only make me believe that this is a definitve version. Roald Dahl didn't like the first version (with Gene Wilder), and it was risky to attempt a new version, but Burton is intelligent enough to do it right. One thing I didn't get was, if the old grandfather worked for Willy Wonka, why didn't Willy age accordingly. As Dahl intended, it's a lesson that rotten little spoiled kids will not always get everything they want. Previous reviewers made references to Michael Jackson, and other nonsense. What I experienced was a fine version of Dahl's difficult story, well presented and very entertaining. What I got out of it, as the book intended, is that greedy kids won't always get what they want; that a poor kid with dreams and hope may get more. The combination of Burton and Depp has never failed to entertain me (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood). Both are among the most talented artists in the film medium, and I enjoy that. \\"Charlie\\" is another feather in Burton's cap, and Depp, with his intelligent side-glances, removes any doubt that he's the finest actor today, risky and complete.  If you know the book, you'll understand. If you don't, just enjoy the film. Burton did a fine job.
B000000OSG|1.0|This album sucks! All I can say is that the only good song on <br />(part 2 of the Illusions would be) Civil War. November Rain was <br />the best song of the Illusions. People who said that Get In The <br />Ring is a really cool song needs to listen to really terrible <br />music such as The Beatles, and AC/DC. WHAT IS ALL THIS BAD WORDS <br />IN THE ALBUM? I HATE IT!!!! PLEASE DON'T READ WALLY GATOR'S REVIEW. I LIKE GUNS N' ROSES, BUT YOU ONLY NEED 2 GOOD ALBUMS, <br />APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, AND GREATEST HITS. <br /> <br />Buy AMERICAN IDIOT by GREEN DAY insted.
B000002WU9|5.0|As Wu-Tang Clan members began dropping solo albums, Raekwon teamed with partner in crime, Ghost Face Killer for a solid debut Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...  With all production held down by RZA, he tailor made the tracks to fit a mafia's, drug dealer's setting as a whole as the Chef stated on \\"Striving For Perfection\\".  The slow, violin laced and down played keys for \\"Knowledge God\\" invites the mentality of a street story.  \\"Criminology\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer has an old school feel, as the two flows without a hook or chorus just a violin and horn samples for the bridge.  \\"Rainy Dayz\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer & Blue Raspberry is a story about Rae thinking of his future as he spits knowledge in a story.  As we get a feel of the tight knit Wu-Tang saga, \\"Guillotine (Swordz)\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer, Inspektah Deck & Genius goes back to the original 36 chambers of death as does \\"Wu-Gambinos\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer, Method Man, The RZA & Master Killa.  \\"Can It Be All So Simple (Remix)\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer has the same beat as the original with new lyrics.  For a more hip-hop feel \\"Ice Water\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer & Cappachino has a basic track with a scratching dub during the flows of each.  On a more up-tempo mood set \\"Glaciers Of Ice\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer & Master Killa blended nicely with the off-beat sample.  With funk guitar lick and a steady violin strum \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer & Nas fits well with the trio's style and flow that added to the album's direction of a drug dealer's lifestyle.  Ghost Face Killer flowed solo on the simply plain \\"Wisdom Body\\" as he speaks of a woman's physic.  The real introduction of Cappichino or Cappadonna was on \\"Ice Cream\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer, Method Man & Cappichino, as he stole the show with graphic verbal word play.  \\"Heaven & Hell\\" featuring Ghost Face Killer has the same old school feel as they tag team over a gritty sample.  Chef Raekwon could out do Betty Crocker and has enough flavors for Mrs. Dash on this LP.cker and has enough flavors for Mrs. Dash on this LP.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When Jack, the main character of the movie (Edward Norton), finds himself suffering from insomnia, he decides to join all sorts of clubs. He joins the testicular cancer group, the parasites groups etc. He then finds himself sleeping like a baby. After a while it all ends, because Marla ruins everything. They decide to split up the groups equally, but our hero never thought that he would meet Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). After an explosion Tyler and Jack start their own little organization where you can release all your anger and free yourself from all pain. This is called the Fight Club.  <br />     When this movie first came out I thought to myself \\"Here is another stupid movie about fighting\\". A year passed by and Fight Club came out on one of the HBO channels. It was about one in the morning and I said \\"What the hell, I'll watch it I have nothing else to do anyway\\". After the credits started rolling, I was amazed. I had no idea just how good the movie was and just how wrong I have been for judging it before I even saw it. Since then I have seen the movie many times and I still love watching it. If you are not a Brad Pitt or Edward Norton fan, you still will be amazed at their performances. I recommend this movie to anybody. If you have not seen it you definitely should.
B000000Y27|5.0|One of Wes Montgomery's best albums, if not THE best, and one of the best albums of the 1960s. Technically Wes was at the top of his game at this point, and he came into the recording studio at the end of January 1960, in very high spirits: his daughter Toni had just been born and he had just signed a deal with Fantasy where he'd be able to record with his brothers Monk and Buddy.<br /><br />All of this is evident on this recording. And pianist Tommy Flanagan, whose mere presence almost assures a successful recording endeavor, is playing at peak form. Highlights include the initial recording of Wes's WEST COAST BLUES, which would quickly become a jazz standard; a superb version of GONE WITH THE WIND, which is an example of virtuoso guitar playing at it's finest; and D-NATURAL BLUES, with great down-home feeling, that some NYC jazz fans from the 60's might remember as never-to-be-surpassed jazz dj Ed Beach's background music. But everything on this CD works marvelously, and the album became the one against which all other Montgomery albums were measured. A gotta-have CD.
B0000047GA|5.0|Emergency!, and its companion, Turn It Over, are about as good as it gets.  Completely groundbreaking when released, the sound is avante garde even today.  Williams plays like a man possessed and McLaughlin, whose guitar virtuosity carries more purpose and funk than it would later in his Mahavishnu Orchestra work, has never been better. The third member of this unlikely trio, organist Larry Young, contributes enormously to the sound's uniqueness with smeared chords that appear according to some unfathomable logic, he is always surprising and interesting.<br /><br />The Tony Williams Lifetime played so loud that on club dates Williams needed monitors to hear the drums. Hard to imagine just three people produced this tidal wave of music.  The singing is forgettable, although not horrible. But the melding of rock, blues, and jazz is truly astonishing. This has been called the first fusion album, and it's true that Williams, along with McLaughlin, were, in collaboration with Miles Davis, at the very edge of fusion. Whether it's the first can be debated, what's indisputable is the way Emergency! raises the bar for rock and jazz, from the vantage points of technical excellence, daring, and sheer unbridled intensity. A must-have recording.
B0009A40ES|1.0|I recently watched this movie and must say I was terribly disappointed.  Christian Bale did a good job, but he was failed by the script and the direction.  I can't compare it to the book, because I have not read the book.  If it was attempting satire it misfired.  This was essentially a cross between the classic \\"Psycho\\" and a David Mamet play.  The voice-over narration was intrusive, an almost \\"Wonder Years\\" gone dark.  If it was attempting to discourse about the boundaries of sanity and insanity, this was already better handled In Roman Polanski's movie \\"Repulsion,\\" with Catherine Deneuve.  The idea that preppies of the eighties were a shallow lot, and that some people in power may not be altogether sane is not exactly a news flash.  In fact, the latter can be found in \\"Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari.\\"    Worst of all the movie was just plain boring.  Hollow with cold surfaces.
B000005IS1|5.0|Kick Out The Jams was MC5's first album. It was recorded live infront of a large audience in October 1968 in Detroit. Though the band claimed it was a recorded document of \\"the revolution\\" they were right, not in the meaning they intended, however. It did revolutionize American rocknroll and music forver. It was the the end of garage punk and the beginning of PUNK. The MC5 werent a whole lot different than early to mid 60s punk acts like The Standells or Mouse And The Traps. Sure, they were more blues rock oriented in the vein of Hendrix but they werent unlike many of their comtemporaries. They were however an exciting enough of a live act to get a big enough fan bases to be signed to a record copanie to release a live full-length. Led by activist frontman John Syclair, they were spokesman for the revolution. They played at riots and demonstrations in the 60s and were the real deal unlike many hippie bands who would [...] out of such events. Kick Out the jams is a sonic assault on the sences and preaches sex, drugs, rocknroll, and liberation. This paved the way for The Stooges, The Dictatora, and later bands like The Ramones and The Dead Boys. MC5 were EVERYTHING that was great and fun about rocknroll minus all the boring [...] you dont want. They were not pretentious or arty like most late-60s, early 70s bands. They were fun garage rock that made it ok to just have fun and made rocknroll dangerous and aggressive. The whole album is amazing. Every song is in your face fast power chords and fast drums except the blues protest song, \\"the motor citis burning\\". This is an essential for fans of 60s rock, garagre rock, and early punk!
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka,<br /><br />The amazing chocolatier.<br /><br />Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka,<br /><br />Everybody give a cheer.<br /><br />He's modest, clever and so smart<br /><br />He barely can restrain it<br /><br />With so much generosity<br /><br />There is no way to contain it!<br /><br />To contain it,<br /><br />To contain, to contain, to contain!<br /><br />Hooray!<br /><br />For those of us that grew up with \\"Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\\" it is hard to approach \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" and not start doing the Oompa Loompa song from the former every time the computer cloned Deep Roy shows up in the latter.  I must admit to having not yet read Roald Dahl's original book to include it in the mix as well, and while I am sure that makes a difference to the millions who have, I would not be one of that number (although certainly I am curious as to how this movie will imprint on young children for whom this is their first cinematic trip to the Chocolate Factory).<br /><br />The justification for \\"remaking\\" the classic Gene Wilder film is established in the title, which indicates that this time the story is more about Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) than it is about Willie Wonka (Johnny Depp).  That things will be different this time is not do so much that despite the above ditty and the Oompa Loompa's singing commentary on the demises of each of the other children this is not a musical, but that Tim Burton is the director.  As soon as you see the sorry state of the Bucket's shack it is clear this is one of his films, and the Teutonic architecture of the Chocolate Factory and the gardens of earthly delights inside is only more evidence for the inevitable conclusion that Burton is the perfect director for Dahl's story.<br /><br />Actually I liked the parts of this 2005 that took place outside the Chocolate Factory more than the trip inside, which is partially because basically the same things happen to the other kids that happened in the other film (and, I believe I can safely presume, in Dahl's book).  Before the journey inside Charlie's grandparents keep trying to steal all of the scenes inside the shack, but there is something endearing about a poor but happy family (think the Cratchits with another generation thrown into the mix, albeit all in one bed).  However, the best part of the film comes at the end when we go beyond the happy ending of the original film, and not just because it is something different.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore provides the same sort of simple, naturalistic performance he did in \\"Finding Neverland.\\"  Consequently he makes Charlie a rather ordinary good kid, so that he comes out ahead on his own and not simply by default because the other children are such brats.  I found Johnny Depp's peculiar way of speaking as Willie Wonka to be pretty effective (clearly he is in his own little world) and commiserate with the focus this time around on Charlie rather than the chocolate maker.  As for the idea that Depp's performance is based on Michael Jackson, I have to say that I do not see it.  The pale skin is because Willie Wonka never goes outside into the sun and if such pigmentation was enough to invoke the new man without a country then Burton's \\"The Corpse Bride\\" represents Jacko-mania.  Depp's Wonka is a strange little man, who is not particularly endearing, which is exactly what is required for most of the proceedings.y presume, in Dahl's book).

B000BEZPQE|5.0|I went to the concert one week before the album came out.  For anyone who has ever been to a Slipknot concert, you know the feel of it, the vibe, the energy, the aura surrounding the band and the crowd.  The album took me back to that night.  It is by far my favorite live CD; it captures the show perfectly.  If you haven't been fortunate enough to go to a Slipknot show, this is your chance.  It is by far my favorite Slipknot album. <br /> <br />Ha, it's impossible to review all of the songs on the album (there are 24!) but my favorites have to be The Heretic Anthem, Spit it Out, Vermillion, Wait and Bleed, and The Nameless.   <br /> <br />Buy the CD to re-live one of the best nights of your life, or buy it to have the chance to finally hear a dream come to life.
B000063DFN|4.0|After hearing the \\"Live After Death\\" live album, it's almost impossible to ever listen to \\"Aces High\\" again without Winston Churchill's \\"fight\\" speech.  But \\"Aces High\\" is what starts this brilliant album out on a high point.  And if that's not enough,  it goes right into the instant classic \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\".  The album also contains my personal favourite and penned by Bruce Dickinson: \\"Flash of the Blade\\".  The guitar riff is awesome and such cool lyrics as \\"You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast\\"!  \\"Back in the Village\\" is the throw-away song.  And if I hear \\"back in the village\\" repeated one more time, that's when I'll go insane.  Tell me why I have to be a \\"Powerslave\\" marks what would be the concert hilight of the album.  A simple song with good guitars and cool lyrics.  And then of course the epic album closer that they have become known for.  It's Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic story \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" set to the music of Iron Maiden!  So awesome!  The slow instrumental in the middle drags a little but has a great pay-off at the end!  Overall one of the best Iron Maiden albums (and one of my favourite concerts... on level with KISS).  With \\"Flash of the Blade\\" being worth the cost of admission!<br /><br />At the time of this posting, Amazon doesn't seem to have a track listing.  So, here it is for your pleasure:<br /><br />1. Aces High 4:31<br /><br />2. 2 Minutes To Midnight 6:04<br /><br />3. Losfer Words (Instrumental) 4:15<br /><br />4. Flash Of The Blade 4:05<br /><br />5. The Duellists 6:18<br /><br />6.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a tragic love story about man who desperately loves a woman he can't have. I'm a guy and this film at some points of the film had me in tears. I think that's the magic of this musical, it's touching no matter who you are.<br /><br />The acting was superb. I never thought that Butler (Dracula on Dracula 2000) would fit so perfectly in his role as the Phantom. The actress who played Christine was excellent as well, and her voice indeed was very beautiful. Everyone did very well.<br /><br />I have heard some of the songs before, I'm a fan of musicals, but never have I seen them performed on stage. It adds to the music to actually see the scenes being performed. The sets are beautiful as well. Jaw dropping indeed.<br /><br />Overall, this film was a masterpiece for sure. I recommend all see this movie. I enjoyed it tremendously.
B000009HF2|3.0|THIS ALBUM COULD HAVE HAD MORE ATTENTION TO IT. THE FIRST 2 SONGS YOU'LL NOTICE DROP OUTS. IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY USED A CASSETTE TO RECORD THIS ON CD. SHOW ME THE WAY DID NOT SOUND AS GREAT. BUT AFTER THAT IT WAS OK. I GOT THE MOBILE FADELITY SOUND RECORDING OF THIS ALBUM AND THE CROWD SOUNDS LIKE THERE INSIDE A BULIDING INSTEAD OF OUTDOORS. IT'S OUTSTANDING THE ONE TO OWN. OUT-OF-PRINT THOUGH. THIS ONE REVIEW SAID SHE SAWE IT LIVE. IT WAS NOT ALL RECORDED IN ONE PLACE. IT WAS TAKEN FROM DIFFERENT CONCERTS. BUT IT IS NOT FAKE. I WENT TO A PETER FRAMPTON CONCERT IN 1997. A LITTLE RUSTY. BUT NOT BAD. ONE SONG HE HATED TO DO IS (DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE DO). THAT IS THE MOST REQUESTED SONG AT EVERY CONCERT. I LIKE, I WANNA GO TO THE SUN, I'LL GIVE YOU MONEY, LINES ON MY FACE AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE DO. THEM ARE MY TOP SONGS.
0446677450|5.0|I highly recommend that all college-trained people read Rich Dad Poor Dad. It will clean out your attitude and teach you what works in the real world. Hey, if all of your college Prof's are doing so great, why are they not millionaires?  <br /> <br />Having wasted a ton of money and time sitting in classes and carrying around those big heavy textbooks and realizing that all it did was prepare me to be a good employee for companies that could care less about me.  <br /> <br />No thanks!
B00005AAFS|4.0|This album is very strong and good. The first six songs are very good, but it's all lookalike, the same with the other five songs, the worst song is Reinraus, and the best are Ich Will, Feuer Frei and Sonne. The others are all good, but when listening to the whole cd, it starts boring after Mutter.<br /><br />Keep on rocking!!
B00021R7CG|4.0|Although the movie is fifteen years old now, its message is potently timely.  BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT revolves around what happens when terrorists nuke a Russian city and make it look like the US did the deed.  Retaliations ensue and the movie becomes a frightening chase to stop further annihilation.  When it appears that President Martin Landau has been killed, he is replaced by warmonger Darren McGavin who is paired up with another hawk, Rip Torn.  They decide the only way to WIN the war is to take out the leaders.  A subplot involves lover pilots Powers Boothe and Rebecca DeMornay who are piloting the bomber set to do the dirty deed.  The tense what if scenario is played out beautifully, with acting kudos to Landau, McGavin and Jeffrey DeMunn who plays a soldier who wants everything to stop, but is hogtied by McGavin and Torn.  Along with FAIL SAFE and DR. STRANGELOVE, BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT is a hearty testimonial against nuclear weapons.
B000001EUN|5.0|Wow, this is the best cd made by the Scorpions in the eighties, definitively a must-have for every Metal-fan. I really was surprised when I heard this much heavier music than what the Scorpions made before. Awsome, really, and ofcourse not every song is heavy, but seven are. The best song is Animal Magnetism en the worst is Lady Starlight, but that is jsut because I dislike ballads (mostly). Make It Real really woke me up, and the next song rocks like a hurricane!!! Well, I recommend this album highly, and after buying it: enjoy!!<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!!
1400034779|5.0|This is truly one of the most remarkable books to come out in recent times. Though the storyling is far from ground-breaking, the brillianty penned story from McCall Smith sets up the series of books perfectly, and will ensure you want to read on to the next book. <br /> <br />The story follows Precious Ramotswe, an independant, philiosophical and very patriotic lady from Botswana, who sells some cattle she receives from her father after his death to set up a detective agency-'The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency'. From beginnings which include an abusive husband as a young woman and a father of whom she is immensely proud, she emerges a strong and well respected woman determined to become Botswana's first female detective. Hiring a secretary and setting up shop, the heroine begins the uphill battle. Her first cases range from a doctor with two personalities  to a missing person, and Precious finds herself having to apply her strong morals to many of her work situations. <br /> <br />What makes this such an amazing book is the character. Alexander McCall Smith truly breathes life into Precious Ramotswe, presenting her philosophical outlooks, high ethical standards and opinions on all things from Western culture to the everchanging state of her beloved Botswana. McCall Smith has created one of the most memorable and beloved characters in modern literature, and it is nothing short of amazing just how well he has stepped inside the mind of a 30-ish female from Botswana.  <br /> <br />This book really is everything you hope for. Incredibly funny in parts, moving in others and very reflective and thought provoking at times, it is any book lovers dream, and Precious Ramotswe has earned her place as one of literature's great characters. I simply cannot reccommend it or the other books in the series highly enough.
B00006DEF9|1.0|I love this movie! I would give it 5 stars, however, this particular product was broken when I purchased it. <br /> <br />Wait, let me clarify, not broken, but had NOTHING recorded on the first DVD. Completely blank! How am I to watch the movie? <br /> <br />Warning! Check your DVD immediately upon receipt and make sure they actually recorded something on it. Amazon does not accept returns after 30 days!
B00005JNTX|2.0|This is exactly what you'd expect from folks with past succes whose heads get a little too big. There is virtually no dialogue in this film. The whole movie, from start to finish is narrated. It's like the directors are playing \\"dollies\\" with the actors. Or as if they don't trust the actors to convey the stories correctly or the viewer to understand, so they're going to tell you exactly what the story is. Ho, hum. And I don't care how much violence there is in this film, because there is an overabundance they could do less with, it is still a ho-hummer. The movie is apparently a chain of \\"pulp fiction\\" stories, most of them having nothing to do with anything or each other, other than to stretch the movie out so it won't be a short film. I'm guessing Tarantino's attempt to remake the Switchblade Sisters fails miserably and unconvincingly. I don't think the Switchblade Sisters would return as a gang of prostitutes.    Skip this movie and read a comic book instead. At least you'll have fun figuring out the comic book's story than being narrated by a boring movie with truly sickening characters.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|In this CD age, the pontificators of the music world deem themselves worthy of stuffing an insufferable amount of filler just because technology allows it.  That is one minor problem with this otherwise worthwhile set from the Christine McVie-less outfit.  Another being that it's Christine McVie-less.  People under-estimate the totality of her role in the eon that is Fleetwood Mac.  While many of her songs are FM [and F.M.] classics, the importance of her contributions as an over-all factor is lost on the hordes of Stevie Nicks fanatics.  But, she was the middle ground, tying together the space cadet flakiness of Nicks and the avant-gardism of Lindsay.  That said, there is still plenty of that avant-gardism and flakiness - which, in the realm that is Buckingham Nicks, feels cozily at home.  And there is still no denying their power of songcraft.  In spite of the aforementioned minor quibbles, adding only a few missteps along the way [e.g. Nicks' lazy drawl brings down a few of her tracks], Lindsay's brilliant `Red Rover' & `Miranda' are oddly beautiful and emulous, and Nicks is haunting on `Goodbye Baby' and splendid on new Mac classics `Running Through the Garden' and `Smile At You'. Buckingham utilizes Nicks' gift for harmony gloriously.  And, second only to the Stones, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood continue to prove that legendary rhythm sections are not made of folklore, but breathing and alive and kicking.  I'm not sure how Christine would have fit in on this CD, but as it stands on its own entity, this is Fleetwood Mac's most satisfying and consistent work since \\"Tusk\\".  My grade: A-
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I started watching this film hoping to be entertained and excited. It did not dissapoint me. Was it as good as the first film? No but I didn't expect it to be. I will definitely be watching it again.  <br />I liked the ending. I would have been disappointed if it had ended with Neo wiping out all the machines. That would have been a bit of a stretch for me.  <br />The scenes are still brilliant, especially the scenes of the war where the machines get into Zion. My recommendation is to turn off the lights, take the phone off the hook and let this film entertain you.
B000A7DVY0|5.0|A MUST HAVE for any dude. Put it on your xmas list! I can't seem to watch this movie too many times, i start laughing as soon as scenes begin, just anticipating what's coming up. I think, however, it should have been called the \\"Dude's Edition\\" not \\"achiever\\" but that's just me.
0553801503|5.0|This book is a worthy installment in an ongoing series that knows no equal. It's is therefore strange to read so many one or two star reviews. Reviews of people who clearly lost the plot and instead are blaming George for having lost his. <br />If you have read this book, and by reading I mean absorbing everthing that is being said and explained, I can barely fathom that there are people telling us that there is no plot advancement. I can only assume that they must be people slow on the uptake or people who thought for five long years that Feast would be even more shocking than Storm of Swords. The former group I won't even comment on but to the latter I'd like to say that it is only logical that after a fought war there are things to be set straight, tasks to be handed out.  <br />What is more is that this book serves as a base to finally introduce those other important factions i.e. Dorne, the Iron Islands, so oft hinted at in the previous books and to develop them into something more than just hearsay. <br />All in all this is an intelligent book that keeps the intelligent reader entertained and which leaves you with a taste for more. And trust me, more we shall have when A Dance With Dragons comes around
0385513755|5.0|When I read the Code when it first came out, I was hoping for great illustrations to accompany the text. I was THRILLED when this came out... i loved turning the pages and seeing the almost-textbook-like tour through the thriller. I'm looking forward to the movie, but to be honest, not as much as I was excited to get this version.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the fan.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|I am not sure who wrote the official summary for this album, but this is certainly not the first Sigur Ros album sung in Icelandic. If I am not mistaken, \\"()\\" was the only one done completely in Hopelandic. Thankfully, they are back to Icelandic, which is so melodic and beautiful, I am not sure why they ever decided to leave it out in the first place. After sound experiments on \\"()\\" and the soundtrack to \\"Englar Alheimsins,\\" I am glad to see they have put out a solid album again.
B0000041DF|5.0|Martha Argerich has been dubbed, appropriately, the \\"lioness\\" of the piano. These recordings defend her reign as the most bewildering technician and capricious romantic. <br /> <br />These two recordings are absolutely the most amazing ever made of the Rach 3 and Tch 1. I am a pianist, and have studied both these concertos; I can say from experience that the technical prowess and the romantic, psychotic, she-devil emotion with which Argerich plays these pieces is unparalelled.  <br /> <br />With her astonishingly efficient technical approach to the keyboard, she is able to effect the most bewildering, roaring tidal waves of notes. Some criticize Argerich for playing things fast just to play them fast, but there is something special in her interpretation. Especially in these two recordings, she clings by a fingernail to her technical limitations, creating truly thrilling pianism and enhancing the extravagant romanticism of Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky. <br /> <br />There is just nothing--nothing at all--that could equal this recording. It will keep you glued to the edge of your seat for its entire duration. BUY IT or regret it for the rest of your life!
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is the gold standard. It is to pop music what Casablanca is to cinema. Although it lacks the flowing cohesiveness of Sgt. Pepper and the bold, risk-taking of the White Album, Revolver is the quintessential Beatles album because it combines the artsiness of the Beatles' 1967-68 work with the pop elements of Rubber Soul and their early period. The genius of Revolver is that the first four and the last four songs of the album are the best. You almost wish other artists would do this. \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" used to bother me, since the rest of the album is so freaking close to perfect, but they don't anymore and they have grown on me somewhat. I still don't think they are great songs, but they are still pretty solid. \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" should be interpreted as a lullaby with an impressive melodic sensibility and despite \\"Yellow Submarine\\"'s trite lyrics, the song still has some cool sound effects to compensate for the lyrics. But don't take my word for it; \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" is a favorite of Paul's and even John expressed admiration for it. The first eye-opener is \\"Love You To\\". With its sitar and fast-paced bongo drumming, the Beatles were aiming for something different, reaching a new level of maturity by leaps and bounds. I consider Paul to be the greatest piano player in rock history and his piano work is on fine display here, particularly on \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"I Want To Tell You\\". \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was the breakthrough on the album and is perhaps the one Beatles song most ahead of its time. It signaled that the Beatles would be expanding their sound and confirmed their true significance in the realm of pop music. It is a tour-de-force of backwards tape-looping and originality. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" remains one of the great album closers in rock history and still sounds fresh and exciting to this day. To give a general idea of the impact of the song, the Chemical Brothers are known for remixing this song in concerts. For anybody wondering about the hype surrounding the Beatles, Revolver is, without a doubt in my mind, the best place to start for the uninitiated. Revolver is a blend of different styles and genres put together in a tight, concise package. Revolver's diversity is similar to The White Album, but Revolver is a better representation of the group since it captured the Beatles at the peak of their influence. Few, if any, albums in rock history have balanced art and pop so masterfully. Beyond essential.this song in concerts.

0679731725|5.0|Please ignore the reviews here that offer a tepid endorsement of \\"The Remains of the Day\\" as a quaint piece of Victorian revival literature. These reviewers have just utterly missed the point--indeed, one wonders whether they can actually read.<br /><br />Kazuo Ishiguro's novel is in fact the most brilliant, emotionally subversive piece of literature to come out in many decades. It's true that on the surface the thing reads like a Victorian-era life-in-the-great-house kind of novel. The genius of the book is that Ishiguro never drops this tone, never once breaks the conceit, yet it quickly becomes clear that the novel, just below the surface, is about something else entirely. It is about emotional truth, and the way that refusing to come to grips with emotional truth can shatter a life. In other words, Ishiguro copies the form of a Victorian novel while brilliantly subverting it to a modern purpose.<br /><br />The tension between the surface calm of the novel and the deep emotional tragedy at its heart grows and grows, becoming nearly unbearable, yet by then you are hooked and cannot stop reading. Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this amazing novel, and don't imagine that seeing the movie is any kind of substitute for reading it. It is a modern masterpiece.
B00000634J|4.0|This is a great album women and Jealous guy and Beautiful boy are great.  The only thing about Lennon well a couple of things I dont like the Imagine track even though good piano and vocal i disagree with the lyricks and I ama Christian.  Lennon,s best work was 63 through 65 the Beatles personal oppinion. GodBless
B000AL730O|2.0|Chaos and Creation is a dreadful dirge of McCartney sappiness. The songs are an endless blend of ballads where it's hard to hear where one song picks up and the other leaves off. I'd like to here McCartney make some rock-n-roll again. Maybe he could team up with Ringo Starr, who could show him how it's done. All of you who like this CD are probably the same ones who liked Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\", another example of washed up old musicians who just don't know when to retire.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is good don,t get me wrong here, but man know nowere man the best song by John lennon in his Beatle career Hay Paul is my favirote but nowere man is my favirote John song the vocals are great and the gitars and Bass fabulous. GodBless
B000000OUJ|5.0|Hands down one of my favorite albums of all time, though even I can admit it doesn't stand up to \\"Cuban Linx\\" and \\"36 Chambers\\". Nevertheless, GZA is an outstanding lyricist with damn powerful delivery (you've probably seen him perform \\"Knock, Knock\\" on the first season of Chappelle's Show, and NO other emcee brings that intensity with the exception of Ghostface, ODB and early Onyx). The Genius is right up there with Rakim, Kane, Kool G Rap and Ice Cube as a master of the microphone. He can rhyme and rhyme all day and kill any rapper with his words just as well as he could on \\"36 Chambers\\" (see \\"Clan in da Front\\"). The only difference between GZA and 90% of other stellar emcees today is that GZA has the RZA at his back with beats that will blow you away. They can be dark and grimy (\\"Duel of the Iron Mic\\") or perfect for bumping in your car (\\"Living in the World Today\\"), but they always fit together perfectly with GZA's intense rhymes and powerful delivery.    But when you buy this album, you get more than just the Genius spitting over powerful RZA beats. You get all 8 other Wu members plus some Killa Bees too, and none of them disappoint. In fact, Method Man even goes far enough to outshine GZA on \\"Shadowboxin'\\", which is arguably the best song on the CD and the first single from it as well.    After listening to this album and the other 5 albums that were in the first set of Wu solo discs, \\"Liquid Swords\\" is by far the best, both in lyricism and production. Now, GZA was never able to come up with a classic hip-hop song like ODB's \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\" or \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\\", Rae's \\"Incarcerated Scarfaces\\", or Meth's \\"Bring da Pain\\" (hell, the closest thing to a classic on this CD was the one song where Meth performed better than the Genius), and that's probably why he doesn't get all the respect he deserves. Instead, GZA is cursed with powerful consistency throughout this entire album. The Source slipped up by not giving this album 5 mics, so instead \\"Liquid Swords\\" will have to remain an underground classic instead of get the mainstream respect it deserves.    If you're not into dope beats and tight lyrics this CD might not be for you, but if you like banging kicks and snares and rhymes that'll make you press rewind and say \\"DAMN, did he just say that?\\" this album is probably for you.

B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|I came across this album and decided to purchase because it was \\"something different\\".  I could not have been more pleased!!  Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull take some old favorites and give them a creative and memorable twist.  The new tracks are also fantastic.  This has become my family's favorite album of the season. My college age son took it to the dorm, and it was a favorite there also. My recommendation is to BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW if you don't already own it! You won't regret your decision!!
B00005JO1G|5.0|I dont understand all the negative reviews about this movie... <br />Even if you dont like war movies, the special effects, unique environment, and engaging music are well worth the price of admission.  <br /> <br />1). The acting is superb- all of the characters seem natural and realistic- exactly the type of people that join the army. Jake Gyllenhal and Jamie Fox outstanding. The characters developed throughout the movie. Jake Gyllenhal was a very interesting character. The director chose not to portray him as a hard core marine but as a man in war that is very recognizable today; a man capable of good but struggling to keep his sanity under harsh conditions.  <br />  <br />2). Original- This movie depicts war in a new light. Boredom, uncertainty, and ambivalence have set in as a result of technological warfare. This move captures these feelings through relationships with wives/girlfriends, anti-political sentiments, the football game <br /> <br />3). Real- THIS MOVIE WAS BASED ON THE TRUE ACCOUNT OF A REAL SOLDIER. therefor all this moaning about it being offensive, antiwar, antimarines, left wing propoganda is COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS. One might as well criticize John Donne's \\"Dulce at decorum est pro patria mori\\" for starting antiwar sentiment. The vulgarities in this movie seemed fitting and were effective in setting a mood. <br /> <br />4). Ending- contrary to popular oppinion, the ending is fantastic. It accurately portrayed the effect desert storm had on the soldiers. The window scene where the director mixed the desert and resedential US was brilliant. <br /> <br />5). Thought-provoking- This movie actually makes a person THINK. The director left many ambiguities. As the move ends, we ask ourselves,\\"Does all the boredom, uncertainty,and toil make war even more honorable?\\" My verdict is absolutely. Well done to all the marines that served in Desert Storm. Semper Fi <br /> <br />
B000065BPB|5.0|All I can say is they are AWESOME!  They truly do sound phenomenal, but I will concede that they may not fit every head size correctly.  I have an average head, and they fit wonderfully.  My Wife who has a smaller head said that she didn't think they fit \\"tight\\" enough to cancel out any sound... <br /> <br />Would buy them again.  No regrets!
0451167716|4.0|It was with a little trepidation that I opened my paperback copy of \\"The Godfather\\", recently found for one euro at a thrift shop.  The movie is so iconic and so well done, would the book stack up?  I'm glad to say the answer is mostly Yes.<br /><br />At first I found the writing to be substandard.  Puzo goes to repetitive lengths to stress Sonny Corleone's brute physicality and his brother Michael's calm intelligence.  Also notable was the sex scene in the first chapter; any book containing the phrase \\"blood-gorged pole of muscle\\" is treading a fine line between pungency and raw pulp.  But things settle down as the book progresses, and Puzo builds layer upon layer of detail to shade in the Corleone family.  The story of how the Family, so benevolent and pleasant-seeming, trades \\"favors\\" with policemen, politicians and criminals alike to maintain strict order in the criminal landscape is devastating.  It is a marvelously attractive life in the Family, if you overlook the intimidation and murders.<br /><br />It's hard to read \\"The Godfather\\" without thinking it is full of cliches; of course one has to remember that this book created the famous images and catch-phrases.  And the book is expansive in scope, ranging from Vito Corleone's ascendency to Michael Corleone's exile in Sicily to the Family's eventual expansion into Las Vegas.  There are a couple of superfluous side plots, but the main plot (dealing with the Corleone family's resistance to the burgeoning drug trade being pushed by competing families) is more than meaty enough to make the book a worthwhile read.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw Serenity on opening night, and many more times after that. Joss Whedon has done a great job at creating a western feel movie set in the future. His attention to detail in the film is excellent.  <br /> <br />If you were a fan of the TV show, Firefly, this movie will certainly increase your love for the ship and its faithful crew. And if you are one who has never seen the TV show, after watching this movie, I guarantee you will be back to Amazon.com, placing the series in your cart.
B00005A0V0|5.0|Light English progressive rock but mind you it does get heavy on some parts particularly on the epic nine feet underground. The line-up are master musicians they may not be banging their hands but their music hits you strongly. It's like a fairy tale with rocking minstrels.
0441012906|1.0|All the earmarks of an early novel -- not remotely in the class of Revelation Space series in terms of plot sophistication, crafting of cultures, motivation of characters and such. <br /> <br />In fact \\"Century Rain\\", when stood next to Reynolds supposedly earlier books, is so much less an effort, that it smells of a cheap publisher scam -- find some unpublished early work by newly acclaimed writer, spruce it up a bit and publish it as a later work. <br /> <br />Almost half the novel is smothered in a tedious and embarrassingly ill constructed   \\"out of the frying pan\\" sequence where the two protagonists escape from one increasingly improbable death defying situation only to land in an even worse mess <br /> <br />Scant attention is paid to the pace, detail, nuance and character motivation that made Reynolds wonderous Revelation Space series the gold standard of hard SF. <br /> <br />On the whole, I want my money back!!
0790731509|5.0|A poignant exploration of Man and his relationship to God, \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is also an excellent, entertaining movie. Paul Newman is at his peak both physically and as an actor portraying Luke Jackson, a man who is at odds with the authoritarian structure of life in general. Once a decorated war hero, he finds himself on a chain gang as punishment for his ill-advised revenge (beheading parking meters). Luke was obviously the hope of his family, and was the apple of his mother's eye. The story is set fully into motion when his beloved mother dies and Luke is denied leave to attend her funeral. This last act of arbitrary authoritarian heavy-handedness crystallizes in Luke the final desire to resist The Boss even if it kills him.<br /><br />The movie is beautiful to look at. It is entertaining to play \\"spot the future star\\" during the prison barracks scenes (look fast for Dennis Hopper and Wayne Rogers). However, the movie eventually becomes a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be a Christ-figure, and what it means to feel abandoned by your god. The final traffic light winks to red and you know that Luke was just \\"standin' in the rain talkin' to myself\\". That's an idea worth thinking about no matter what your religious convictions. Excellent entertainment. Recommended.

0962477060|2.0|This book might be interesting to someone who is picking up a guitar for the first time, but it is not helpful if you have been playing for a while.

If you want to play rock, try any of the books by (...).
0446677450|1.0|this book makes me want to vomit.  from the beginning of the book, you get to hear the story of this guy's dad, and how wise he was to not pay someone any more money than they asked for, because they deserved to be poor.  that's right, guys!  according to this book, the poor deserve to be poor!  i suggest the author take a trip to some place like africa, and visit any of the MILLIONS of poor people on this planet (after all, us well-off americans are the vast minority) and tell them to their face that it's their fault.  hey, maybe it's God's plan!  after all, this is a CHRISTIAN book, right?  gee, i thought God was supposed to be against greed, and for treating people right.  guess i was wrong.  a great primer on how to treat people like dogs and have a heart of pure stone.  Godly?  HA!
0345440900|4.0|There was a lot in this book that I did not use, but the EASY part was worth the whole thing!  It saved my life as a new mother.  I read many, many books while pregnant, as many moms do, and this is the ONLY one I read that told you what your daily schedule might actually look like after the baby got here.  As a new mom you don't have a clue of when they should nap and when they should eat, or why they're crying.  At least with EASY I knew that if he was crying after eating, it was time for activity.  And if he was crying after sleeping, it was time to eat.  Without this book I would have had no clue at all what I was doing.  I still let him fall asleep while eating from time to time, but it didn't hurt anything.  I show the EASY parts to all new moms I know.

Such a shame, because the instrumental work is some of the best cryptopsy has done. Flo is amazing as usual, the guitars are blazing, great bass work... but then Lord Worm comes in... Well, what I can say is that Lord Worm does write some fairly awesome lyrics, so I'll be a bit more generous with the amount of stars I'll give this. Bottom line: Ignore the vocals, and you have one killer album.
B00005JOMY|5.0|Harry's a burglar in New York who, to escape arrest, winds up auditioning for a part in a Joel Silver like film that's destined for Colin Farrell.  He's whisked away to the phony world of LA, where every girl named \\"Jill\\" spells it \\"Jylle.\\"  At a fabulous cocktail party he meets Harlan Dexter, once a B-movie actor and now a very rich enterpreneur whose daughter has only recently returned from a long sojourn to Paris.  Harry also meets his high school sweetheart, a girl who never gave him a toss back then, but now she's seeing him with new eyes.  The two of them share an appreciation for the pulp novels of the 1950s and 1960s featuring a Mike Hammer type PI called \\"Jonny Gossamer.\\"<br /><br />KISS KISS BANG BANG is a lot of fun.  Walking into the theater you don't expect such a rambunctious, talky, endlessly yakking movie.  You have to be on your toes, narratologically speaking, the entire time, and don't try leaing your seat to use the restroom, you'll have missed probably the entire point of the movie.  Does even Shane Black know the story he's written, and why the three women who meet their maker got so confused that neither the police, the detectives, nor the gang that killed them seem to be able to piece them apart, like the old shell game.<br /><br />The movie is stunning to look at besides.  The credits are impeccable; we've seen numerous movie credits designed to resemble the old time look of the Bond films, but this one, in rusty shades of orange and black, is stylish and exciting.  In general the designers of the movie deserve awards.  The use of the hotel Standard is brilliant<br /><br />Downey Jr and Kilmer are both pretty entertaining, but the excitement here is the performance of Michelle Monaghan as Harmony Faith Lane (a name that, oddly enough, strings together  the names of two of Buffy's betes noires).<br /><br />As Harmony Miss Monaghan, a Denise Richards lookalike, shows a talent that can stand right up next to the fast talking dames of the thirties like Rosalind Russell or Carole Lombard, and plus she has a genuine American beauty tht makes it believable she could come from somewhere central, like Indiana.  You root for her to succeed, even when she shows the more disagreeable sides to her personality.<br /><br />I can imagine some people disliking the movie and its constant air of being in love with itself, and yet when the dust is cleared we are always searching for an American cinema with wit and flair, and here it is in this giant, heaping portion, and you would be a fool to turn away such bounty on account of its presumption.  I hope it does well enough to merit numerous sequels, as THE THIN MAN did.  It's on that level if you ask my opinion.<br /><br />PS, what happened to Shannyn Sossamon?

B00003CXIY|5.0|This is a really film you don't have to worry about the acting or the story, just have a fun time watching Road Trip on a Friday night with a pal or your lover. Before I thought this was going to be a silly college buddy film, which it is, and have barely funny lines. I was wrong and I had a hard time trying to calm myself down from laughing too hard at some secens like the boys got in their car and jump over a bridge and then the car broke down. And my favorite part was the skinny boy having sex with a big black girl.
B000286S8S|3.0|Ok, first off this is a pretty good compilation but could've been so much better. I do like the track list (alternated from DLR to Sammy). Cool idea and keeps it fresh. Most of the great tunes are here but they missed a few essentials. Where's HUMANS BEING, LITTLE GUITARS, DON'T TELL ME, THE DREAM IS OVER, SOMEBODY GET ME A DOCTOR, MINE ALL MINE, AMSTERDAM and HEAR ABOUT IT LATER. All of these tunes are great and should've been on the CD instead of the live tracks, UP FOR BREAKFAST, LEARNING TO SEE and DANCING IN THE STREET. What about the track that was left off the TWISTER soundtrack...the one that was to be VH's STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN??? I'm sure there are other unreleased VH tracks (better than UP FOR BREAKFAST and LEARNING TO SEE) that would've been nice additions for the fans. I think, to make this compilation complete, they should've included WITHOUT YOU (Cherone had very few decent tracks but this one was ok). <br /> <br />Any die-hard VH fan knows this release was to pump up the supporting tour. I'm sure that was the main reason to include the live tracks. I think Eddie is more about the money than the fans these days (the band looks like they're done...again).  <br /> <br />Most of these tracks are great but this compilation is lacking. I'm a huge VH fan but this was disappointing. Too many tracks are missing and too many lame tracks made the final cut. It seems like the real agenda was to pump the tour or maybe Sammy didn't want to include HUMANS BEING or the 'other' unreleased TWISTER track because that was a rough period for the band? Most VH fans will have this material (including a proper version of FINISH...) so there isn't much here to get a die-hard fan excited (I have to admit IT'S ABOUT TIME is a great tune). However, it's the best greatest hits package out there for VH so any new fans and casual fans would enjoy it.  <br /> <br />The liner notes/booklet are really lacking. Cool presentation and packinging but the content...well...it wasn't anythingspecial.
0553801503|5.0|I'm truly puzzled by the negative tone of so many of the reviews.  Martin's series is excellent--well plotted, well written, dynamic characters, intriguing situations.  This book is not as action-packed as Storm of Swords was, but it allows us to learn more about other cultures in the ASOIAF world and to get to know new characters who are clearly going to be key in the rest of the series.  By now several of the earlier POVs are no longer with us and the action is expanding beyond the areas of Westeros and the Dothraki Sea we've known in the first three books.  Think of Feast as a \\"rebuilding year.\\"  We spend some time at the Citadel, learning about its goals, and more in Dorne and Braavos.  We meet the Sand Snakes.  We learn more about the Faith of the Seven as an institution in Westerosi society.  We also get to know old characters better--especially Cersei, Jaime, Aemon, Margaery, and, oddly, Ser Ilyn.   <br /> <br />Although several key POVs are missing, we hear about them every so often.  I missed Tyrion; this book has less humor than the others, although it's still there.   <br /> <br />It's far too early to say that certain POVs were too long or unnecessary; we don't know where Martin is heading and what we'll need to know when he takes us there.  Perhaps Brienne will turn out to be the Prince That Was Promised, or we may learn that Jon's parents are Ser Hyle and Taena.  Pod, having spent some time in stasis, may be revealed as the supposedly-dead Aegon.  (If any of these things come true, remember where you read them first.)   <br /> <br />I think that the book after Dance will bristle with action.  When we get it, we will be glad we had this slower book to help us understand what's going on.   <br /> <br />Oh--read carefully!  Martin's quite the trickster.   <br /> <br />
B0000DYJM6|4.0|Anyone that's into PJ should really check this out. Some of these tracks are amazing and could've easily made it on a 'regular' PJ CD. Down, Other Side, All Night, Leaving Here, Footsteps, Sad, Undone and Yellow Ledbetter are the high lights. The first six should be on 'rearviewmirror' (Yellow Ledbetter is already there).  <br /> <br />There are a few other decent tracks like U, Hold On and Let Me Sleep. Last Kiss is a good one but way overplayed. A few others are listenable and then there are a few that I could do without (Dirty Frank, Sweet Lew, and Gremmie...). <br /> <br />There are a some tracks I wish they did include(Long Road, I Got ID, the tracks from the SINGLES soundtrack, Angel, Sonic Reducer and Crazy Mary). <br /> <br />I enjoyed the different sounds on this collection. The last few PJ CD's were decent but the band's sound is getting stale. Leaving Here, All Night and Down sound a bit different (I know covers don't get on studio albums so Leaving Here wouldn't get on one but it was still great to hear different music from PJ). <br /> <br />All in all this is a great PJ experience so give it a try.
B0002O06N0|5.0|I dont own their first two albums, and though I plan on getting them asap, this one sounds somewhat under their quality.  Yes, i rated it 5 stars and im rambling about how it's not good, but, I really enjoy the more blues influenced songs on their first two, but dont get me wrong, this one has got some down-and-dirty riffage, just not as down-and-dirtier as the prior.   <br /> <br />As I mentioned before the heavily bluesey stuff lies in their first two releases, but the hard rockin' licks of this one deserve a listen as well.  In fact, not just one listen, but many, several, unlimited, so go buy it, right now.
B000002OVJ|2.0|Sorry I can't rate this one higher but its not for the music which rocks but for the remastering. I heard the original on tape and then bought the remastered cd.  This was conceived as an official bootleg and was the first of its kind. It was a clever idea as the bootleg industry was gaining steam at the time and the band wanted some of the cut. Fair enough. The original record and cassette said something along the line of \\"clicks and pops intact\\". In other word it was rough and raw similar to a bootleg but without the guilt. Perfect for a band who have called themselves the \\"godfathers of punk\\". However, this reissue despite having many more songs (the complete concert, plus their full set of Tommy if you buy the deluxe version) has been remastered and overdubbed so it hardly sounds live at all. I don't want to know how the Who wished they had sounded live, I want to hear how they actually did sound live (which judging by the concerts I've heard from the 60's is pretty damn good). Bring the clicks and pops back please.
0380789035|4.0|The story begins with the main character, Shadow, explaining what he did for the three years he spent in jail: getting in shape, learning remarkable coin tricks, and mainly about how much he loves his compassionate wife and how much quality time he will spend with her when he gets out. Soon Shadow learns that, when he is let out a day early, that his wife died earlier in a car crash. With nothing to look forward to, Shadow attended his wife's funeral while learns the context in which his wife died in, leaving him angry and mystified. Afterward while wandering, he meets Wednesday, whom he learns later after a drink and job offer to act as a bodyguard, that [Wednesday] is an old god.<br /><br /> The conflict is between the old gods (Wednesday and his crew) and the new ones (computer gods and cell phone gods, etc.). The war is often referred to as the storm which will give the answer to the question of if the new gods are existing, then the old gods can't or vice versa. The ending is a twist, interesting, frustrating (in a good way), and very well written.

B00003CX9W|2.0|As I write this review, it was 5 years ago this very day that the Walt Disney Co. released the classic \\"Fantasia\\" for the first time on DVD as a 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  But exactly 5 years later, you can no longer purchase a legitimate, new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price, via such avenues as ebay.    As a Disney shareholder, I am one unhappy camper!!    This is the only reason I'm rating this classic 5-star film with only 2 stars.  The DVD is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least $40 or $50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under $30 (and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by).  I'm sure I'm not the only consumer that's really sick and tired of Disney's inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their DVD releases.    So what am I supposed to do now?  Wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this DVD when Disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again?  I think not!  I can't wait that long, and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point.  Or, should I instead pay an insane price now for an original copy (the profits of which WILL NOT go to Disney)?  Again, I don't think so!  I do not believe in getting ripped off, and refuse to support those that profit from it, regardless of supply/demand fundamentals.    If Disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on DVD after only 2 to 3 years of availability, it shouldn't surprise them at all that they're actually LOSING POTENTIAL SALES to counterfeit/pirated versions of the films that are being sold around the world (and from auction sites like ebay, too).  The way I see it, THEY ASKED FOR IT!!  By not making these classics legitimately available at all times, they are encouraging piracy.  It's that simple, and they deserve it!!  In this day and age, people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want NOW!!    I guess Disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper DVD version of the original \\"Fantasia\\" just so I can show this classic to my nieces and nephews.  I'd much rather buy a legitimate copy that's reasonably priced, but I can't because Disney won't allow me to do so.  Oh well, it's their loss.  A classic film like \\"Fantasia\\", which came in at No. 58 on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time, deserves a far better fate than this.     Great job Disney!!  Way to go!!

Fascinating journey with an author who has seen more life than some of the best adventurers of our times.  <br /> <br />Eminently valued.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|This may not have been a \\"plum\\" of a role for such a high-caliber, beautiful actress, but Halle Berry would be good in any role. And it's not just her beauty! This fascinating woman can act! <br /> <br />And if she wants to play the part of a cat--or even a dog--in her next movie, I'll be first in line to buy a ticket. <br /> <br />Like her, I'm a native of Ohio, and we Buckeyes stick together.  (Just kidding! I stick with her because I admire the total woman she has become, despite a stormy background and obstacles that would halt a lesser person dead in her tracks.) <br /> <br />I look forward to seeing this talented, gorgeous actress in more Oscar-winning roles and feel assured that there will be many in her bright future! <br /> <br />Go, Halle!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|By now you've no doubt read the full range of reviews from those who think Joss Whedon is God, to those who think this movie is the scum of existence.  (I'm puzzled how a simple movie can create such emotional responses, but I digress. <br /> <br />I'll tell you this, I went into this movie having never seen any of the original FireFly TV series.  I went in expecting big Sci-Fi action - I came out thinking, \\"That was not a Sci-Fi movie\\" - and it's not.  It's a western - in space!  Yes, these people are in spaceships - and yes, they are on different planets - and yes, it is in the future.  But at this point, the Sci-Fi aspect has reached its zenith.  Every planet they land on could be earth, there are no \\"strange alien worlds\\" - in fact, there are no aliens at all!  And their guns do not fire lasers, they fire regular bullets.  And they don't beam down to the service, they fly down.  Basically, aside from the spaceships moving them from planet to planet, there is little Sci-Fi to this at all - well, the whole \\"government turned my sister into a psychic super-weapon\\" thing is Sci-Fi, but that's about it.  As for action - again, not a big budget blow-'em-up action type of movie.  There is a \\"hovercraft to ship\\" chase near the beginning, and a brief but major space battle near the end - but in between, it's mostly fisticuffs for the action.  So, in short, if you are looking for a STAR WARS style big-action movie, or a STAR TREK themed science fiction alien-fest, you will likely hate this movie! <br /> <br />BUT - if you like your movies deep and intelligent, then buy this movie.  If you like your cast to have such a strong repore that you'd swear they've known each other from the cradle, buy this movie.  If you like witty dialogue that isn't purile and obscene, nor written on a 6th grade level, BUY THIS MOVIE!  If you like a movie that leaves you begging for just another half-hour to spend with the characters, BUY THIS MOVIE!!   <br /> <br />Yes, it wasn't what I expected - but it was so much more!  It was a movie with a purpose, a movie with a background, and a movie with a purpose beyond the titilation of violence, sex, explosions, and eye candy.  Joss Whedon, like George Lucas or J.R.R. Tolkein, has not only created a great cast and storyline, but has set them in a world that is so backed-up with sub-story, so possible as our future, and so realistically conveyed, that you end the movie just wanting to explore every aspect of this future world, yet only having just scratched the surface!  Like the best of stories, you leave with the sense that, though what you saw was good, what you didn't see was so much more interesting - and you hope to get a sequel just to delve deeper into that world!  That's why this film drew such comparisons to STAR WARS - not for it's budget, nor for it's mystical force-centric storyline - but for its ability to sell you on the Universe it has created. <br /> <br />And let's not forget the actors - this was probably one of the best casts ever assembled (for both the TV series, and the movie).  Through great writing and skilled acting, you get a real sense that these are not actors spouting lines, but real characters who have been working on this ship for over a year now, and have developed a true bond.  Each actor convincingly fills their space with talent and believability.  None of the lines ever feel inserted for the sake of becoming a new catch-phrase - every line is believable and serves a purpose!  This is what TRULY makes this film (and the TV series it came from) so unique and worthy of another fully-budgeted shot at the big time! <br /> <br />Unfortunately, everything this film has going for it is exactly what curses it to failure.  The mass audiences of today do not want a deep and well thought out storyline.  They want explosions, boobies, and potty-humor, or else they call it stupid.  Or, if it's set in space, it HAS TO follow the STAR TREK mold, or else it cannot possibly be any good. <br/> <br />But, if nothing else, Joss Wheson did his fan base a HUGE favor by bringing the Firefly story arch to a satisfying closure, while still leaving an open door for future stories.  With this movie, one can enjoy the original 13 episodes, and then cap it off with this movie, and feel like they have a complete piece of work, should a sequel or revised TV series never take place. <br /> <br />So, if you are tired of the insulting fare Hollywood has spewed onto us over the last few years, SERENITY may be for you.  If the new STAR WARS trilogy left you cold, this might be the movie for you.  If you can appreciate the poetic beauty of a true western set in space, this movie will appeal to you. <br /> <br />But if you are simply going in for the misleading DVD cover and the promise of a big action spectacle, you may want to think again!  Even so, give this movie a chance to work it's magic! <br /> <br />FINAL NOTE - to all you \\"ONE STAR\\" reviewers out there, I challenge you to provide an actual REASON why this movie sucks - merely saying, \\"IT SUCKS - I'M GIVING IT ONE STAR.  EVERYONE WHO LIKE IT IS STOOPID.\\" does not convince anyone.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Many have critiqued this movie as overly long and boring.  I would contend that that was precisely what director Peter Weir was trying to do.  Look, this movie is about a ship of war and the men on it during the height of the Napoleonic war.  The movie is book ended by two incredibly filmed battle scenes.  In between, life on a ship in the early 19th century is examined in harsh detail.  Of course, to any reader of Patrick O'Brian's novels, the highlight of the film is the relationship between Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin.  No one could have played the temperamental Aubrey better then Crowe, and no one could have played the intellectual Maturin better then Paul Bettany.  Probably the one scene that contrasts these two characters is where the \\"Surprise\\" reaches the Galapagos.  Here we see Maturin stare out the port side contemplating biology and nature, while Aubrey stares out the starboard side looking for any evidence of the enemy.  Aubrey is the man of action who holds onto the notion of national pride, while Maturin, always the intellectual, is indeed a man of the future.  Although they are two different personalities, they complement each other well and their friendship forms the spine of not only the movie but also the great series of books.  After watching this movie, especially in the theater, one could almost feel that they were actually on the H.M.S. Surprise for 2 hours.  Peter Weir has always directed pieces that demonstrated the terrible stress and travails of war.  There was probably a temptation by the producers to dumb down the movie and not talk about weather gauges, mizzen-masts or broadsides.  This temptation must have been great because four separate studios financed the project.  (20th Century Fox, Miramax Films, Universal Pictures, Samuel Goldwyn Films LLC).  Much credit should be given to Weir for not dumbing down the original spirit of O'Brian's work.  Overall, Master and Commander is good old-fashioned film-making at its best.
0684824906|5.0|Over a thousand volumes have been written about Lincoln. In the excerpt I read of this book we see him preparing for the convention, an outsider and longshot whose capacity for storytelling and acting with great decency and kindness have already made him an Illinois legend.<br /><br />The book traces the story of Lincoln and his his major rivals for the nomination. It takes us through the campaign and describes the complex relationships of Lincoln with his rivals, some of whom like Stanton become his greatest admirers. It is Stanton who after the assassination said , \\" Now he belongs to the Ages\\" .<br /><br />I have read a number of reviews of this book, and all of them are admiring of  its scholarship and its quality of writing.<br /><br />In the pages I read I felt what might be called the special presence of Lincoln, and got a hint once again of what makes him so fascinating to us. This great man , likeable and humble, yet so human, suffered much personal loss and humiliation and yet gave through his life the example of ' transcendence'- transcendence of humble origins , transcendence of personal pain, transcendence of rejection, defeat and humilation- and in this transcendence realized the American dream in a way no one else has before or since.
B00003CXA6|3.0|Gettysburg is a film that is really not meant for consumption by the general public.  The length of the movie alone is over 4 hours.  When I went to go see this movie in the theaters, there actually was an intermission.  There are two ways to approach a critique of this movie.  One is as a historical interpretation.  The movie is based on the book \\"The Killer Angels\\", and the book is very accurate in the course and scope of the battle.  For Civil War buffs, the book and movie are slanted towards Longstreets' recollection of the battle.  In that vein, the movie fits in nicely into the historiography of modern Civil War studies.  As a movie, the scope and cinematography have a very grand vision.  Some...repeat some...of the acting could be construed as overdoing it and Longstreet's beard looks like it was ordered from \\"Beard Club For Men.\\"  Those are minor points however, and once the viewer gets past those parts, the main characters can more then hold their own.  For a Civil War buff, like myself, the movie never felt like it was slowly paced.  (Unlike the prequel \\"Gods and Generals\\" which was probably the most slowly paced movie in cinematic history.)  Martin Sheen has taken criticism for his portrayal of Lee, but I tend to believe that he was excellent as the patriarchal, beloved and aging Southern general.  From the viewpoint of the historian, Lee, in 1863 was convinced of his own invincibility and Sheen's acting brings this home.  Jeff Daniels, one of the most flexible actors of our generation, plays the sometimes aloof ex-professor Chamberlein with ease.  Overall, Gettysburg is just one interpretation of this momentous battle, with excellent acting on both sides.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Terry Jones, the co-director of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\", once said that comedy is defined as two disparate forces coming together and colliding.  That definition may not fit into all varieties of comedy, but for the Monty Python crew and especially this movie it does.  Almost all the scenes in this movie are true masterpieces of this definition of comedy,  whether it is a medieval serf spouting off neo-Marxist thought, or the ancient enchanter named \\"Tim\\".  This film also contains the greatest `deus ex machina' ending in the history of cinema with police interrupting Arthur's last glorious charge.  On a personal note, the first time I saw this movie at about the age of 15 on PBS, I did not know what to think.  When the film ended with the camera being confiscated by the authorities, I said to my father: \\"What happened?\\"  My Dad responded \\"I guess they ran out of film...you know PBS.\\"  So, for those of you who have not seen the movie, try to savor your reaction the first time you see a cow flying over a castle wall, or the attack on Castle Aaaaaaargh.  The DVD special features are well worth it too, with an insightful director's commentary and a trip with Jones and Palin touring the sites where the movie was filmed.
6303921248|5.0|I say that in the title without having yet seen the latest version of P&P starring Keira Knightley, but I think I'm pretty safe in going with the tide of public opinion on the A&E version (which I added to my permanent library today after having earlier rented it via Netflix).  It's the best and most detailed version of the classic novel put to film - and that includes the famous Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version, which is, in all truth, a great classic movie in its own right but had to telescope a lot of the events to stay within a standard theatrical running time (a problem which I think also will affect the newest version).  TV provides a much better format for the telling of long stories in miniseries format where all the details can properly be explicated.<br /><br />The producers of this program also are responsible for the excellent 1996 version of Austen's \\"Emma\\" which was an early Kate Beckinsale vehicle.

1400031087|5.0|This is a book that should be required reading in high school.  It is a book that many recovering addicts will probably have a problem with in its shunning of the 12 step program, but as a 9 year sober recovering cocaine addict myself I embrace Mr. Frey's path to recovery.  I had many of the same problems that he did with the 12 steps, replacing one addiction with another and so forth, but AA was my stepping stone to recovery and I spent 365 days of my life going to at least one meeting a day.  After that I stopped.  Frey's \\"big book\\" is the Tao, and for him and perhaps many other's it could be a wonderful tool.  He is so right on about the daily decisions that addicts must make not to use.  It gets easier and easier every day, but it never goes away, and that is what recovery is all about.  Actually if you want to know the truth I could sit in front of a kilo of coke today and not be tempted to touch it (I think).  For me , it is was a lifetime ago.  But I was more like one of the \\"Wussies\\" that he describes early in the book I suppose.  His fellow addicts in rehab comprise a fascinating cast of characters.  They in fact are what really make this book so strong.  Mr. Frey's story is worth telling in and of itself, but it is the surrounding character's that give this book such power.  I surprisingly enjoyed Frey's style.  I had the same prejudice that many of the reader's that did not take as much from this book as I did had. Namely, the guy was 23 when he landed in rehab. He began his addiction at ten. He went through college for 4 years of that time.  Hell, being wasted through college could be viewed as some more as a rite of passage than a descent into hell. How much devistation can that really have caused?  I'm reminded of Drew Barrymore.  The whole rich priveleged brat thing.  But that prejudice is wrong. That was a little voice going on in the back of my head, but the truth is that James Frey was a brave man for dealing with his past in the way that he did (and Barrymore was a brave young lady.).  It's not his fault he had money to enable him to destroy himself more efficiently.  It is truly wrong to hold on to that prejudice when evaluating this book. He has done a wonderful job with this book, and he can be proud that his work will keep thousands of young people from ever trying drugs and aid in the sobriety of thousands more in the future.  That fact alone makes this a 5 star read.nd Barrymore was a brave young lady.).  It's not his fault he had money to enable him to destroy himself more efficiently.

0425152251|3.0|This book, a New York Times Bestseller written by a high-school philosophy teacher, is basically a quick survey of philosophy couched within a narrative. Young Sophie Amundsen is on the cusp of her fifteenth birthday when she discovers a strange letter in her mailbox. The letter asks \\"Who are you? Where does the world come from?\\" So begins Sophie's adventure in a philosophical correspondence course. She receives her lessons via mail at first, as her teacher wishes to keep his identity a secret. Soon, though, Sophie and her professor, Alberto Knox, are meeting in cafes, churches, and other places around town to discuss philosophy. The result is a fairly engaging treatment of what could easily be very difficult and dry material.<br /><br />I thought this was a good book for what it was. In other words, Gaarder was successful in his use of the narrative to introduce and cover some rather weighty topics. (I did find the novel a bit dry in places, particularly when Knox is racing through the Middle Ages at breakneck speed.) As the book is basically a philosphy survey, Gaarder doesn't get too involved in the specifics of every theory; however, Sophie's \\"teacher\\" does try to provide a \\"big picture\\" view of the history of philosophic thought.<br /><br />What intrigued me most about the book was that I hadn't pondered many of the questions in it since my college philosophy courses. I can't remember when the last time was that I wondered where the world came from, or that I thought about whether man has any eternal bits about him, rather than just a temporal form. As Sophie discovers, it is so easy for people to get caught up in day-to-day life. We rarely ask ourselves some of the biggest questions of human existence because we are worried about what we are making for dinner on any given night. That's the primary reason that I recommend this book. So few of us really sit down and think about what our purpose is, and what the world is all about. This book will have you asking yourself those questions again, and it's very refreshing to do so.king yourself those questions again, and it's very refreshing to do so.
0060977493|5.0|If I were pressed to choose only three adjectives to describe this book, those in the title would be them, although I could sum it all up even more simply with in one word: Wonderful. Actually, I might even try to combine all four into one word, something like Poselfassplayerful, or something like that. All that aside, this truly is fantastic. Some accuse it of immaturity, and I can see that, but I don't necessarily think that it is a negative quality in this case. It is a book about childhood, with all its trauma, joy, turmoil, et al, and I really think that more \\"maturity\\" with the subject would have made it didactic and dull. Secondly, the language used in this book is superb. Poetic is almost an understatement when referring to the shimmering, glistening quality of the words hidden between this book's covers. Many have pointed out the obvious debts to Rushdie, especially Midnight's Children, but, in my opinion, Roy's work is just more subtle and effective than Rushdie's has ever been. All in all, a superb book, one that I recommend whole-heartedly and without hesitation.
B00000F5PI|5.0|I watched this because it looked like a good movie. What I got was a great movie!!! The ending really touched me and gets into your real self. Different people change your perspective on life. This was reportedly one of princess Diana's favorite movies to watch. I can see why. YOu have to have a heart to enjoy this movie. From what I hear it's pretty accurate too on Austic People because one of my friends has an autistic brother and she describes him like Raymond.
B00005JO1S|4.0|I took my 5 1/2 year-old nephew, a kindergartener, to see \\"Zathura\\".  I expected Michael, as someone who's been exposed to a steady diet of Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, and Spider-Man, as well as to Peanuts, the Wiggles and the Muppets, to enjoy the sci-fi elements.  Predictably, he spent the second half of the film cowering in his seat, latched onto both of my arms... and he walked out of the theater at the end loving every minute of it, completely jazzed about the experience.  We spent most of the 10-minute walk back talking about outer space, aliens, and how it was all fiction, and he drew a lot of pictures of aliens (most of whom looked like Muppets) once he got home. <br /> <br />As others here have said, the language used by the two boys in the movie (10 and 7) is a little disconcerting.  However, they use the same words I was exposed to at that age, and comparable to the language Michael is exposed to at home.  Michael didn't walk out of the theater cursing, so that part of the movie did not bother me. <br /> <br />The scare factor is somewhat intense.  The predictable monsters don't show up until the final two reels and aren't what I'd call terrifying, although that's the part of the movie that had Michael cowering.  There's also a big clunky '50s-style robot, but when you find out who provides the voice you'll realize that this wasn't meant to be terrifying -- not if anything to say about it Jon Favreau had.  The images of the house floating through space, alongside asteroids and suns, is what will really stand out for the younger viewer. <br /> <br />This is basically a kids' movie directed by Jon Favreau, so naturally it's going to seem odd.  Based on the uncomfortably short shorts worn by the teenage girl in the movie (and she has nothing else to do at all), I'd say the target audience is boys 9 to 12.  There's also a surprisingly deep plot twist involving another game player that the boys meet as their house drifts through space.  I had trouble explaining that to my nephew, although his grandmother didn't understand it either. <br /> <br />My final verdict is that it's safe to take a smaller child (6-ish) to this movie, and they will not take anything negative away from the experience.  It's no loss if you make them wait another three years before seeing it, though.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is utterly amazing. On first listening, some of the songs don't sound great. After about 3 times, you'll find yourself humming it unconsciously, and realise you've come to love this album. And some songs on it, such as City of Blinding Lights, you will fall in love with instantly. Ignore the people who say it doesnt compare to their old stuff - the truth is it CANT compare to them since it's so different. The album is worth buying just for City of Blinding Lights, and any doubts you may have had about buying the album will vanish if you go to one of the Vertigo concerts. IMO, this album, along with Best of 1990 - 2000 and A.T.Y.C.L.B joins the ranks ot the greatest rock music ever composed. Well done, U2.

So all in all this album was another fantastic opeth album but i think future opeth albums will not be the same with the 10+ minute songs i think opeth might try to make there songs shorter so they can be put on TRL. <br />

B0000029DD|5.0|The only official album released during Jeff Buckley's far too short life was Grace in 1993. Grace was a very apt title; in fact it could have been called Complete Grace or Perfect Grace, as the album was both complete and perfect in every way.<br /><br />Jeff Buckley was the son of folk hero Tim Buckley, whose life was snatched away from the world in 1975 when the singer/songwriter was only twenty eight years old, leaving behind a young nine year old son Jeff. Therefore it makes it even more heart rendering that the young Jeff was taken from us in 1997 after an afternoon swimming in a seemingly placid lake when his time was literally swept away. Jeff Buckley was only thirty one when he died, but had so much more to offer the world both as a musician and as a human being.<br /><br />Jeff Buckley went into the studio to record his first full length album in 1992. So far there had only been the four track EP Live At Sin-e with producer/engineer/guiding light Andy Wallace. Andy Wallace was nicknamed `The Fist' due to the necessity of keeping the young Buckley's mind focused, as Jeff was nothing if not a wandering spirit.<br /><br />Jeff Buckley brought along as his band Mick Grondahl on bass and Matt Johnson on drums. And although Michael Tighe was to only play guitar on one track on Grace, he was to join the band full time once they hit the road after the recording was finished. The combination was to literally strike sparks.<br /><br />On the completed album, ten tracks were selected from those recorded, seven originals, two co-written by Jeff Buckley and Gary Lucas, one with Michael Tighe, one band composition (the closing Dream Brother), three Jeff Buckley solo efforts, and three perfectly selected cover versions.<br /><br />It is perhaps surprising given Jeff Buckley's undoubted all round abilities that on first listening it is the cover versions that stand out. But then when you look at the standard of songs that were chosen maybe not.<br /><br />J. Shelton's Lilac Wine is the first of these songs that come up in the album's running order. Jeff Buckley sings the song with very little accompaniment; the very loose strum of an electric guitar and the guiding caress of the rhythm section during the verses is all that is needed. Such is the song's beauty that it will bring even the most rowdy room to stillness as people listen to the power of Jeff Buckley's voice.<br /><br />Hallelujah from the Leonard Cohen book is a song that Jeff Buckley took with his band and turned into his own after the release of Grace. The Jeff Buckley Band would always close their main set with a rousing version of Hallelujah, which again has very sparing, but telling musical backing to a wonderful Jeff Buckley vocal tour de force. The song is sung with such great emotion you are dragged along with it, all quite involuntarily, such is the strength of the performance.<br /><br />Benjamin Britten's Corpus Christi Carol (For Boy) with its church-like undertones, shows off yet another facet of Jeff Buckley's voice, leaving the band very little to do but accompany their leader as sympathetically as is possible.<br /><br />This is immediately followed by the Jeff Buckley Grunge Rock classic Eternal Life (this has perhaps been granted to the band by this song alone), when the band members are given their musical wings and allowed to soar like some deranged eagle into the sky. Mick Grondahl's bass is right at the front of the mix, whilst Matt Johnson thrashes away at his drum kit, and Jeff Buckley slashes away at his guitar. The vocals make it hard to believe that this is the same singer who only seconds previously had been singing like a choirboy, now sounding like a gutter rat. This is without doubt a Garage/Grunge Rock classic, something to really thrash your head too.<br /><br />As the feedback drains from the last guitar chords the album's final song, Dream Brother, sends shivers down your spine.

B0000797IO|1.0|This film was meant to be funny according to the reviews on the box \\"a triumph\\" \\"one of the funniest films of the year\\" .....it was AWFUL. We found this depressing beyond belief and we really cant see how people could find this film amusing at all. Didn't think much of Jennifer Aniston either. <br /> <br />A real let down especially as the trailor doesn't look too bad. Take our advice and don't waste your time watching it!  <br /> <br />
B0002EXH5O|3.0|I have recently copied many Megadeth's albums from library and discovered band's music. This isn't one of those CD's. I actually bought this. I had heard Hangar 18 and Holy wars from Greatest hits compilation and liked them and I had also read praising reviews about this album. So my expectations were high. Did this album answer to my expectations? No. I like more bands commercial style and I'm not really a speed metal fan. This album lacks a couple thing, great vocals for example. Dave's vocals are really not in the top notch. If you don't believe me, compare his vocals on this album to the vocals on The system has failed and Cryptic writings and you'll see the difference. <br /> <br />This album seems to me also little cold and impassionate. And many songs are too straightforward for my taste, which has been always my problem with Iron maiden's music. But technically this album is flawless. Just listen to the perfect drum- and basswork and outstanding guitar solos. If you are a Megadeth fan you should no way avoid this album because there are some brilliant pieces of music on this impassionate album. My three favourite songs are definately Holy wars,Five magics and Tornado of souls which has absolutely breathtaking guitar solo. I think that it is probably the best guitar solo I have heard from Megadeth. If you are not a speed metal fan, this isn't the best Megadeth album ever even though it contains some of the best Megadeth songs and guitar solos ever. In my opinion all four latest Megadeth albums beat this. this.
0694013889|1.0|This may have been a good book back in 1980 when it was written but I think even then it was outdated!<br /><br />The DVD and VCR tape are the same, don't be fooled by the release date.<br /><br />In the book, dvd etc. the little girl who wears cloth diapers..., bends over to show her bum hole. Her grandmother gives her a potty?? It looks like an nice pitcher to make lemonaide in. Very unrealistic in this day and age. She then walks around naked, poops and pees on the floor next to the \\"pitcher\\", and then the next day she poops and pees in the so called potty, yay she's all trained....right. They also call it wee wee and poo poo.....I don't know about you but I call it pee and poop or pee pee and stinky's.lol<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this outdated poop so to speak. Children need more up to date potty videos and books with there favorite tv charaters like Blue or Bear in the Big Blue House Etc. Elmo would be a good one.
B0001AP158|5.0|I totally agree with the people who liked this DVD. I had actually bought the CD by itself and liked it so much that I had to purchase the exported version with the concert DVD. NEVER a disappointing moment - Bon Jovi has never sounded (or looked) better, and their new versions of these songs that are so different than the originals, in my opinion, are brilliant. I agree that Jon's \\"Last Man Standing\\" which didn't come out until  their box set, (which is awesome also), is FANTASTIC, and he explains why he wrote the song and then took it off this CD, and I also agree that the  cover song they sang from way back when by \\"Dr Hook\\", \\"Sylvia's Mother\\", was done to Perfection - I just Loved it!          <br />            I've loved this band for 20 years (I'm 41 now), and I think they just keep getting better and all of their original ideas like re-writing many of their hits and their box set of mainly unreleased songs are not only unique, but it's a tribute to Bon Jovi's talent and genius as song writers and musicians, so Tons of Kudos to Bon Jovi... I can't wait to see you in Nashville in February! That'll be my son and me (he wants to see them as badly as I do) whoopin' and hollering from one of the first few rows- no matter what renditions of your songs you sing! And by the way, \\"This Left Feels Right\\" is one of my son's favorite CDs by them also - \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" is his favorite off the CD, but he loves the whole CD just as much as I do.  <br />             I wish I could have been at the concert featured on this DVD. It sure looked like everyone in the audience enjoyed the heck out of it! I know I did, and I only saw it on DVD! Just one thing that I don't understand- can anyone tell me how to get to the 2nd part of the set list? I can only get up to \\"Sylvia's Mother\\" and then there's no more set list, no \\"next\\" button, nothing... but there's still a whole bunch more concert! I'd take a star away for that but that would still leave way more than 5 stars sincethat's the most I can leave for a rating, so 5 stars it is... plus a *whole* bunch more that you can't see on Amazon! There's also some interactions games and such to play on the DVDs... it's WELL worth the money!
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Chloe Sevigny demonstrates what has been missing from your acting chops all these years, Meryl, you forgot to perform actual oral on another actor.  For crying out loud, when we say performance, baby, you got to PERFORM.  This is what has been missing from art all of these decades, real make-believe realism. <br /> <br />The rest of Vincent Gallo's film is from the Gus Van Sant school of \\"watching paint dry\\" cinema.  Introduced in the 60's by Andy Warhol, who filmed a man sleeping all night and also focused a stationary camera trained on the Empire State Building for a full day,  these cinematic exercises in tedium had actual idiots sitting through their entire 8 or 12 hour presentations.  I suppose they thought it was art.  Well, Gus and Vincent seem to be attracting the same type of intellect. <br /> <br />So, if your idea of entertainment, or enlightenment even, is to watch a gloomy narcissist endlessly driving across country, with intermittent inane encounters; if you deplore actual dialogue with purpose, characters with depth, and a dramatic strucure that illuminates artistic intent and insight; if you prefer the cinema of turning on a camera and letting it run, this is the flick for you. <br /> <br />For the curious, ninety percent of the film is this boring drivel of shooting out the windshield as Gallo drives, or motorcycle races, or dumb mumbling with vapid women, and Vince doesn't get his k shine until the last 10 or 20 minutes of the film, so you can skip ahead if that's what you want.  Chloe does it well, and I think she has a real career ahead.  Pun intended.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This album didn't impress me at all to begin with, because I found it so predictable. When an album meets your expectations so accurately, and with all the dam hype it recieved, it really doesn't help.  <br />So, with this initial negativity, I thought something was wrong because Opeth have never failed to impress me, except perhaps with \\"Deliverance\\". When listening to an album you try to be objective and without the influence of other's opinions. <br />I put it on again, having shelved it away for a while, cleared my head and simply listened to it. It's brilliant! <br />It doesn't hold for me what albums like \\"'Hearse\\" and \\"Still  Life\\" do, but songs like \\"Baying of the Hounds\\" and \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" make this album special for me, these are among the best songs the band have ever created, and I listen to them very often.  <br />Production is excellent, particularly on the drums I feel, which really stand out. Martin Lopez is phenomenal. <br />Overall, this is a superb album of death/folk/progressive metal (or so I would describe it), with some incredible songs. Having thought on first listen that Opeth's style had become boring, my opinion has changed and I think that they'll just continue to grow further into this suprior state.  <br />\\"Ghost Reveries\\" is like fine wine, whilst I believe it to be Opeth's most sophisticated album, it isn't my favourite, but I believe it will be soon, because the slower an album grows on you, the more it will do so. <br />I suppose I was put off by the fact the band are becoming so popular to the most unlikely of fanbases nowadays, at least in England anyway, and so Opeth becomes anyone's, not just \\"ours\\", know what I mean? <br />5/5.
B000060MMI|4.0|An Irish punk band from California?  Flogging Molly had to convince skeptics that they were actually, you know, Irish on their first album Swagger- which features a seven-minute song called \\"Black Friday Rule\\" that explains exactly how they ended up in California. But by Drunken Lullabies, Flogging Molly had firmly established themselves and developed their signature sound- a mix of guitars, Irish fiddle, and accordion.  They rock hardest on the faster songs- \\"Drunken Lullabies,\\" \\"What's Left of the Flag,\\" \\"May The Living Be Dead In Our Wake,\\" \\"Kilburn High Road,\\" and \\"Swagger\\"- but close out the album with the lovely acoustic \\"The Sun Never Shines (On Closed Doors).\\"  Midtempo songs like \\"Death Valley Queen\\" and \\"Another Bag of Bricks\\" never really get off the ground, and sound like filler between the album's roaring start and its soft, understated conclusion.
0553801503|4.0|Well the king has left the building and the queen has left her mind...it ends with a teaser and leaves me wanting more..It is well written and pulls you into the story.. I would read the first 3 books before this one to get a complete picture. This book is really strong at setting up the events to follow..
0553801503|4.0|After the long, long wait for the release of this book, I have to say that it is not as riveting as the first three volumes.  Part of that is because so many of the best characters were ommitted from this book to appear in the next one.  Part of it is because, in truth, not much happens.  Lots of characters are moving to new locations, making new alliances, forging new identities - but that's about it.  It is quite obvious that this book is really just a bridge to the end of the story - a way to get all of the characters in place for the final installments of the series.  There were some chapters which I had to make myself read, but as with Martin's first books, there were chapters that I could not read fast enough.  And true to form, Martin leaves us hanging at the end, with a cliffhanger that will make you scream in frustration.  But that's why we love him so!   <br /> <br />So, maybe a little more boring than the first three, but obviously getting the stage set for the final scene.  And I can't wait!
0553801503|1.0|A Feast for Crows is a great disappointment. It focuses largely on minor characters, and despite the great length of the novel, very little happens.

B00005JNX0|5.0|I got a taste of Madagascar during the latest movie from Dreamwork's Wallace and Gromit.  I thought the short was great and got the movie.  This movie is well worth it.  If you don't all ready own it buy it today.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Batman Begins isn't another superhero movie in the line of Spider- Man, <br />the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or <br />any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good <br />action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action <br />scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character <br />development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely <br />on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it <br />has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film <br />or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker <br />than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters <br />from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is <br />depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes, <br />this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever <br />and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking <br />lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but <br />ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor, <br />decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing <br />super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the <br />general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in <br />shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as <br />arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt <br />warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of <br />crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is <br />based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one <br />cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly <br />created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City <br />could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel <br />Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone <br />one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good <br />story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's <br />Darkest Knight has ever called home.
B000A59PMO|5.0|NO SPOILERS <br /> <br />I bought the first season of Veronica Mars on impulse while browsing at my local DVD store. What a lucky decision! I devoured all 22 episodes in less than two weeks for the simple reason that this highly addictive series is absolutely one of the best shows I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot, for I'm 57 years old). Apparently other viewers agree because, as this is being written, 93 of 99 Amazon reviewers have given it 5 stars. <br /> <br />Kirsten Bell stars as Veronica, a brilliant, entertaining, attractive, witty, personable, tough, charming and eminently lovable 17-year-old high school student. Veronica attends Neptune High, a school with snobbish and troubled rich kids (referred to as 09ers for their zip code) and a bevy of offbeat middle class kids.  Veronica, who once upon a time was your typical teenager, is now anything but as she works after school for her dad as a private eye. Veronica is completely focused on solving a murder case that her dad, the cops, and everyone else has given up on, a murder that had a huge impact on her family. Her sleuthing will keep you hooked on the series as there are countless twists and turns in this season long who-dun-it. Several clips of previous shows are run at the beginning of each episode to refresh your memory for the ongoing story. The narration is done by Veronica, who also talks to you throughout the story as she feeds you juicy insights, all the while strengthening your bond with this engaging young heroine. <br /> <br />Each episode is also a self-contained unit as Veronica does her Sherlock Holmes routine circa 2004 while adroitly solving cases brought to her by fellow classmates. She works her cell phone, is a master at looking up the dirt on her laptop, impersonates people on the phone and in person, enlists the aid of fellow students and even policemen for off-limits records, cons people for information with consummate charm (or threats when necessary), works her digital camera likea paparazzi, and employs 1001 other tricks of the detecting trade in righting wrongs and solving her always busy load of cases. In the process, Veronica becomes a hero and friend to an ever-growing legion of students and admirers and to you, the viewer. <br /> <br />What is so refreshing about her new cases each episode is that they are not murder mysteries, unlike pretty much every other detective show. On the contrary, Veronica turns things like discovering who stole the school mascot or stopping a jealous ex-boyfriend from showing a sexy video clip into a roller coaster ride of thrills and surprises. In short, the writing is great, the episodes are anything but cookie cutter, and Bell is mesmerizing as she manipulates her adorable face into any of a 100 different expressions that are right on target with the moment. <br /> <br />Keith Mars (played by Enrico Colantoni) is a dad any kid would be glad to have as a father. He totally supports Veronica when he doesn't have hands full trying to keep her in check while she works all the angles as she attempts to solve the murder mystery. Her best friend and constant companion and partner in crime Wallace is superbly played by Percy Daggs III. The supporting cast of friends, archrivals, rich kids, and their neurotic parents is also perfectly suited to their roles <br /> <br />I simply can't recommend a show any higher than Veronica Mars. Because I want you to enjoy the series as much as possible, I am passing along the following tips: 1) Buy the first season and savor each episode. 2) Do not watch the second season (currently into its 7th episode as this is written) because you will destroy the continuity of several story lines (yes, the first season ended with many unanswered questions). 3) Buy the second season DVD when it comes out. 4) Plead with UPN to renew the show for a third season, and to put the second season DVD out at least a month before the third season begins. 5) Record the third season and watch it afteryou've caught up with the second season providing, a) there is a third season and, b) the second season DVD comes out after the third season has begun. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />Philip Capelle
0553801503|5.0|Book three provided EARTH SHATTERING events, and many reviewers seem to hold the lack of \\"major\\" events against this book.  This book leaves out some of the most popular points of view(Jon, Dany, Tyrion), however this half of the story develops other characters and develops some history (I love the rich history of this series).  There are DEFINATELY some major events, just not the incredible pace of events in book three.  I believe a Dance With Dragons will be a better book than this one, but I love this book nevertheless.  When you consider my three favorite characters weren't even present, it's amazing how much I enjoyed it.
0553801503|1.0|I waited so long for this book and it turned out to be a major disappointment. I really could have done without the gross parts.  Is he going to destroy all the good characters?  After the first 3 chapters I ended up skimming through the book.  Don't waste your money or at least wait until it comes out in paperback.  I won't be so quick to be the next book.  Truly disappointing. The first 3 books were outstanding. There was so much potential.
B0000029DD|3.0|Frankly I can't understand what is so \\"5 stars\\" about this album. Is it the music or the tragedy?  <br />Grace reminds me of Scarface. A truly breathtaking performance amidst mediocre content. Buckley has one of the most amazing voices I have ever heard. It is for that that you should listen to this album. However, he couldn't seem to make up his mind what the album wanted to be. Is it a singer/songwiter, opera vocal, or rock album? Lack of continuity and flow aside, its a great performance, just not a great album.
0790729342|4.0|MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR has to be one of the most intense action films ever produced. There's very little I might add to this already popular movie. Both fans and critics are unanimous in their praise for what is the BEST chapter of the MAD MAX trilogy. Having this said, it's also EXTREMELY sad to see the kind of DVD treatment this highly innovative film has received. Unlike the special edition of the MAD MAX DVD, this one is austere at best: a \\"passable\\" dolby 5.1 mix and subtitles. That's it. Picture quality is only mildly \\"acceptable\\" (dark scenes are highly pixelated and hard to understand!). No director's commentary, no behind the scenes, no nothing. For a movie that's being praised as a LANDMARK in science fiction and billed as influential as STAR WARS, the DVD that's available is a crying shame. Why has nobody ever bothered to release a special edition is beyond my reckoning. We see so much \\"trash\\" being released as a \\"special edition\\" and yet we still have to wait for a defenitive DVD of MAD MAX 2. My review, as you might have guessed, is about this most criminal offense. I's rate MAD MAX 2 with an 11 (yep, it's a VERY entertaining movie) but the DVD truly stinks.    Let's hope Mr. Miller comes to his senses and releases a worthy DVD package for the film he will most likely be remembered BY!
1573223085|4.0|A Whole New Mind $16.47 US, is a 2005 release from Daniel H. Pink that covers creative thinking and other aspects of success. Ostensibly geared toward career pros, this non-fiction title analyzes transitions in society as America migrates from an Information Age to a Conceptual Age economy. The text in Dan's book is not academic -- instead it is more biographical, intuitive, observational, and playful. His book is a real triple threat of content, style, and visual presentation.<br /><br />Word to the wise -- you are in for a slightly different book here -- right of the bat, the author walks us through the procedure of having his brain scanned as part of a project conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health in Washington D.C. This unorthodox introduction (with four photo illustrations) is welcomed by the reader, as it gives the chapter an introspective quality. Pink shares this experience to illustrate normal brain function -- to note a few misconceptions about the way the brain divides work -- and then posits that while most people integrate both left and right brain activity, R-Directed Thinking will increasingly be relied upon in the future, by people that want to succeed in business or life.<br /><br />Here is the crux of what Pink is trying to relay. America is currently organized around a cadre of accountants, doctors, engineers, executives and lawyers. These \\"knowledge workers\\" excel at the ability to acquire and marry facts to data, and these abilities are typically accrued through a series of standardized tests such as the PSAT, SAT, GMAT, LSAT and MCAT. (As an aside, Bush's test-happy Department of Education only serves to increase the number of L-Directed Thinkers, providing corporations cheap labor in abundance.) Pink asserts this regime of L-Directed Thinking in America is diminishing due to three factors: Abundance, Asia, and Automation.<br /><br />Our guide Dan conjectures -- that in this age of Abundance -- appealing only to functional, logical, and rational requirements is not enough. Design, empathy, play, and other \\"soft\\" aptitudes have become the focal point for individuals and companies that want to stand out above the others in a crowded marketplace. Look no further than Apple's design-triumph, the physically appealing and emotionally compelling iPod, for quick confirmation of this notion!<br /><br />Looking at trends, Pink concludes outsourcing of white-collar jobs (knowledge work) to nations in Asia will have profound \\"long term effects\\" on the economic well-being of Australia, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US. Just as factory jobs flowed out of the country during the eighties, globalization of white-collar jobs will soon follow. Consequently, most Americans will need to come up with a new skill set that is not abundant overseas.<br /><br />Even if Pink is wrong, and Abundance and Asia aren't transforming America, rest assured that Automation is. In long paragraphs, Pink cites specific examples of how Computer Programming, Law, and Medicine have been radically altered by technology. You'll notice this trend in even simpler venues (like self-checkout at supermarket and department store chains) throughout the US. Implication of Pink's research? Transaction based jobs may soon start declining.<br /><br />Now here are a few key items worthy of consideration -- when it comes to your present or future career track -- according to Dan. Can computers do it faster? Can overseas labor do it cheaper? Are your skills in demand? Are your skills overly abundant?<br /><br />Eventually we'll all have to find new jobs, Pink theorizes. The Agricultural Age and Industrial Age have fallen away, and the Information Age is fading fast. We're hurtling into the Conceptual Age, where the majority of jobs will be held by people that create something, or by people that are capable of empathizing with others. Most of these jobs will require care, humor, imagination, ingenuity, instinct, joyfulness, personal rapport, or social dexterity.<br /><br />Writer Pink explains High Concept, High Touch, avenues of growth that are likely to appear, delves into the importance of gaining an MBA or MFA, and then compares the differences between IQ and Emotional Intelligence in rough metaphor. He then closes Part One with two pages of observation on the baby boomer generation, and their newfound gravitation toward meaning and transcendence, and away from the allure of wealth.<br /><br />Most of A Whole New Mind actually resides in Part Two, wherein Mr. Pink delineates a complex theory of the \\"six senses\\" that one could harvest to build a whole new mind. In Dan's worldview, Design is an asset above function. Story is an asset above argument. Symphony is an asset above focus. Empathy is an asset above logic. Play is an asset above seriousness, and Meaning is an asset above accumulation. After an extensive essay about each of these six components, Pink includes a \\"portfolio\\" of exercises (further reading, tools, and websites) that one could call upon to enhance this mindset, all being useful.<br /><br />In the interest of keeping this review at one thousand words I've concentrated on the first half of the book -- since that is the framework that the book is built around. I will allow you the pleasure of reading the majority of part two on your own, but I'll lightly sketch some factoids that I enjoyed in the \\"portfolios\\" accompanying Dan's groupings.cept, High Touch, avenues of growth that are likely to appear, delves into the importance of gaining an MBA or MFA, and then compares the differences between IQ and Emotional Intelligence in rough metaphor.

B00003CXI1|3.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful book and the beginning to a truly magical series by J.K. Rowling. Any person of any age is highly encouraged to give these books a read--the only danger is that you'll likely get hooked on them. <br /> <br />Of course, this review is about the movie, not about the book... and the movie is... decent. It is a fairly faithful adaptation, but doesn't quite capture the charm or depth of the novel. It feels as though two mistakes were made: 1) They tried to put everything in; 2) They tried to make it a kid's movie. <br /> <br />The first mistake was in trying to put everything that occurs in the book in the movie. In the first place, it was an impossible task--you can't fit a book that size completely into a movie, and you shouldn't try anyways because books and movies are different media with different strengths and weaknesses. In the second place, it makes the movie feel incredibly rushed. In the book, we eventually come to know and love a great many of these characters, such as Harry, Ron and Hermione. In the movie (unless you've already read the book), you'll know them a little bit, but you never get to spend the time with them necessary to really bond, because we need to save space for the next sequence of events. Things happen with little context, rhyme or reason, but just because \\"it happened that way in the book.\\" It would have been better to cut out some of the events, and spent a little more time developing characters. <br /> <br />The second mistake was in trying to make this a children's film. Now, I know what you're saying: \\"But *isn't* Harry Potter a children's book?\\" And yes, it is. And no, it isn't. Harry Potter is a book that can appeal to any age. It does not read like \\"kid's lit\\"--the writing is intelligent and clever, and the plotlines fairly adult and complicated. Children were going to love this movie no matter how it was directed; it should have been done more seriously, because it would have beenmore true to the tone of the novel and more rewarding for adult fans. <br /> <br />On the other side, this movie is still enjoyable, and all signs seem to suggest that the series of films is going to get better over time. The casting is absolutely brilliant--the kids are all spot on, and nothing brings more delight than Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. <br /> <br />Being a lover of the books, I say that this film is a decent interpretation but no substitute for reading the novels. Adults especially who haven't read them, and watch this movie instead, are apt to scratch their heads in wonder a little bit at the popularity of Harry Potter.
B000002HD5|5.0|and I don't care. There are no words to describe the genuis of this album. However, it takes a strong constitution to get through it. It is not for the weak at heart or for those afraid of a challenge. It is everything we had hoped to get from the 90's. Challenging, cerebral, honest music. From the drumsticks to the microphone, each member brings the full compliment to the table. <br />Debonair, Be Sweet, Gentlemen, What Jail is Like. You don't get this many 5 star votes for nothing.  <br />If you take away all the hype, the tragedy, and the record sales from all the \\"Best Albums\\" lists, this album is in the top 3 of the 90's.  <br />Buy it, put it in your cd player and don't take it out until you get it.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Yes, so \\"Fumbling\\" was quite a masterpeice, as well as earlier works, \\"Surfacing\\" was even a little slow-paced compared to the older stuff. I've listened to Sarah since 1989. Long time. Wasn't immediately sold on Afterglow, appreciated the messages in the lyrics. I have to say that going to see the Afterglow concert completely changed my opinion on this recording. Heart and soul were exposed in each of these songs, and I fell head over heel in love with it! Give it a go, not being too judgemental, but with appreciation that as we grow and life delivers so many changes, it shapes who we are, how we conceive things in others to be, and we can present ourselves by means of fresh perspective based on these changes. Good stuff, really.
B000BUYP4Q|2.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie because of so many good reviews. But ....  Without having read the reviews or other synopsis', I wouldn't have had a clue what was happening in the movie. There were so many flashbacks in the middle of scenes you never knew where you were. I like Christian Bale,but his fine acting was lost in the fancy editing. And as for Katie Holmes, her acting was like a piece of cardboard. Thank goodness someone loaned me the movie and I didn't have to pay for it. What a disappointment. Sorry, because I know the other reviews are great, but you must have been watching another movie.
B000005JAX|4.0|This Martin Gore solo abum rules.  I love this album. I love all the remakes of course I'd never heard the originals but who cares. The song mother earth is my fav . The whole album is a deffinate must have for any depeche mode fan.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The theme for my reviews of the first two movies in the Harry Potter series complained that 1) they were too frantically-paced, trying to fit everything in at the expense of the overall film and that 2) they were geared to be \\"children's movies\\" even though the Harry Potter series does not read particularly like children's books, and has a much wider appeal than that. <br /> <br />The new director, Alfonso Cuaron, manages to answer both of my complaints, despite starting out with a novel that is both bigger and more complicated than either of the ones before it. <br /> <br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban slows down the pacing of the film series, and gives us some time to catch our breath. Scenes like showing the seasons change by reference to the whomping willow, and Harry and friends eating candy at night (which Columbus doubtless would have cut), remind us that the plot events in the film don't happen in a rush, but take place over the course of a school term. <br /> <br />Also, the more intelligent direction, and the darker shades and feel to the film, let us know that Azkaban was not filmed entirely for the under-twelve crowd, which seemed true of the first two movies. The novels themselves get darker over time, it is true, but they were never the glitter-coated candy factories suggested by the first two film adaptations. Adults can watch Prisoner of Azkaban and finally understand that, there might be something for them in these novels after all--an impossible conclusion to draw from the earlier entries in the movie series. <br /> <br />Otherwise, as a lover of the books, I only had a few disappointments from details missing in this film. For instance, the lack of explanation about who authored the Marauder's Map was a sore point, as it could've (and should've) been addressed by 30 seconds of dialogue. Still, it will become increasingly impossible to include everything from these books, as Rowling continues to write them larger and larger. <br /> <br/>Overall, a good movie and a much better adaptation of the third Harry Potter novel than were made of the first two. Director Cuaron easily surpasses Columbus' vision, and leads me to have hopes for the upcoming Goblet of Fire movie.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|I thought I was going to be the only person to give Scarface less than 5 stars... <br />Of course stunningly acted by Pacino. However, the overall feel of the movie is pretty tattered. Like Terminator it shows its age in score, cinematography, and direction.  <br />With the recent batch of 3 hour epics it is possible to capture and maintain the attention of an audience for the whole picture. Most of what people remember of Scarface are snippets of action, often misquoted. <br />I don't intend to turn anyone away with these thoughts, just set you up for what to expect.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Other reviewers have capably handled the synopsis. Instead, I'll cover a few other reasons why Halloween is one of the greatest movies ever made. Director John Carpenter's indelible score. Jamie Lee Curtis' acting. The first time a film audience ever saw these particular story elements put together this way. The original Shatner mask and the killer's penchant for hiding in plain sight. The innumerable references to Psycho. The picturesque locales (never has suburbia or painted leaves looked better). And the character of Michael Myers. Before this film, Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left were pretty talked about, but viewers of a certain age weren't really watching those as much as the old Frankenstein, Vincent Price, Gamera, Hammer, and Wolfman movies on television. The scariest thing for us back then was probably CBS showing the hand popping out of the grave at the end of Carrie. Which might explain why, once I saw this odd poster, a hand holding a knife that \\"turns into\\" a pumpkin, I plunked down a whopping $3.50 for a matinee of some movie with Piz Zadora fighting Christmas elves or aliens or something, sat through that nonsense two or three times then, when ushers came in to kick all the kids out, ran onstage, hid behind a curtain, then waited till the coast was clear; then emerged, sneaked into a seat and watched what I still consider one of the greatest films of all. Once Halloween jumpstarted a trend for a new type of monster kids of that era loved it so much we spent our loot not only on this movie, but anything remotely like it. Then there's the fact that the filmmakers unknowingly stumbled into creating a new American myth. Myers and Loomis and Strode and their struggle is as timeless as Celtic lore, lol; and Myers himself finally gave Americans a new holiday figure to join the ranks of The Easter Bunny, Santa, and Cupid. The subsequent installments had their ups and downs and subplots that devolved into utter nonsense--but in the original, you get Michael Myers as he was intended to be seen. A mysterious creep in a mask, with no back story, who revisits the site of his greatest crime and winds up stalking a woman that reminds him of his victim. This movie will always rock. Highly recommended.Michael Myers as he was intended to be seen.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|From the first album by Cecilia Bartoli, I was captivated by her beautiful voice and the ease with which she employed it. I had just started singing at the time, and I remember vividly how deep an impression that album made on me.<br /><br />I was determined to keep up to date with all the recordings she would doubtless make...<br /><br />And it's been quite a journey. Almost without exception, Cecilia Bartoli has delivered absolutely exquisite singing aligned with unique and often incredibly powerful performances. I haven't been entirely captivated by a couple of her albums - the Salieri album, for instance, seemed to me to suffer from bad choice of arias (but as I do not think Salieri can be ranked among the finest composers in the world, it may very well be that nothing better offered...); a duet album in combination with Bryn Terfel (who unfortunately ought not to have attempted that Rossini duet without perhaps a year's training in coloratura to keep up to the exceptional accuracy and speed of La Bartoli); the Haydn Orpheus recording (it seemed to be performed in slightly too \\"girly\\" a way, with Bartoli taking off quite a lot of the sumptuous velvet in her voice in order to give it a lighter - and not so beautiful - a sound); but for the rest...? I've been captivated, enchanted, breathless with admiration, and almost always deeply moved.<br /><br />This recording - Opera Proibita - may be her best yet. We speak here of the finest mezzo-soprano in the world, a singer who has already created some of the world's most glorious recordings - her Vivaldi album, the Italian songbook, her Mozart recordings, her Rossini roles, the Gluck album, her phenomenal Vivaldi DVD, and more. And with such a high standard of excellence, in which is combined a God-given beautiful voice, high musical intelligence, a technique in rapid passaggio which is simply second to NONE, a heart-melting beauty when she sings slower pieces... with this standard, to have achieved this particular recording is yet another benchmark.<br /><br />For long moments after listening to this recording for the first time, I was simply weeping with the glory of it. On repeated listening, it does not fade in its effect - I sigh, I murmur, \\"Oh God, that's fantastic\\", I breathe in the superb and manifold beauties of the recording. And I am convinced more than ever that Cecilia Bartoli is one of the great gifts to humanity in this age. She is one of the wonders of the world, and while that does not shield her from critical analysis by her listeners, it does demand a fair assessment by all who listen to her. To write meanly of this phenomenal performer is to denigrate oneself - Cecilia Bartoli is one of the most generous performers one could encounter, in that she gives everything to her art. One cannot say of her \\"Glorious voice, but what a pity she is so unintelligent,\\" or \\"Lovely sound, but it's a shame she has no passion in the voice,\\" or \\"It's pretty but boring.\\" One CANNOT say that - not if one is honest.<br /><br />Bartoli's voice is dark in tone but light in timbre, like a fine red wine or the best chocolate. It has edge when she wants to give it edge, with a sort of cutting fury that spits out rage and ecstasy. It has meltingly sweet gossamer beauty when she wants that. It has tremendous excitement when that is needed. The voice has a staggeringly extensive range, with upper notes that put some sopranos to shame, and those gorgeous lower notes which make sopranos weep with envy.<br /><br />In the employment of her voice in this album, there is no false step, no discordant note, no lack of heart-stopping beauty, no moment of slackness in the exciting fioriture, no faltering in the exquisite vocal line. Listen, for example, to her singing of \\"Lascia la spina\\". There is no one else who can perform this with tears in her voice as Bartoli can. Listen to the almost unbelievable third aria on this recording (Un pensiero nemico di pace) where Cecilia Bartoli gives no quarterto the music and emerges triumphant from what seems to be a vocal impossibility.<br /><br />Much of the music on this CD was written for castrati, those phenomenal singers who had the lung capacity of a man and the sweet beauty of a woman's voice. Few singers in the world could convey this martial quality as Cecilia Bartoli does, and I suspect none could carry it off with the ease that Bartoli demonstrates. It is like listening to God's soloist angel singing with golden wires, a sound like a baroque trumpet, then like a silken viol, again like a clarion call, then like a delicately-drawn da gamba... One is utterly spellbound.<br /><br />The music itself is of a uniformly sublime standard. The arias are carefully chosen to contrast with each other in technical demand, emotional quality, required timbre, sentiment and meaning.<br /><br />If you wish to hear oratorio sung with all the passion of opera, and all the technical experise and heart-spinning emotional impact that one of the finest artists in the world brings to it, this recording will give you endless pleasure...s no quarter to the music and emerges triumphant from what seems to be a vocal impossibility. <br /> <br />Much of the music on this CD was written for castrati, those phenomenal singers who had the lung capacity of a man and the sweet beauty of a woman's voice.

B00082IJ08|5.0|Every single track on this sophomore effort is worth at least a few listens. Some songs take a few spins to grow on you. The Gorillaz are a very unique sounding group, using elements of techno, hip hop, jazz, and rock in their music. Personally, I love it. But a lot of people I know can't see the greatness in their original style. So yeah, this is kind of an acquired taste or a hate it or love it thing. I'd say overall, though all of the tracks are solid, my top 3 would be as follows: <br /> <br />1. \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" <br />2. \\"Dare\\" <br />3. \\"November Has Come\\"
B00000DLUV|3.0|Although I am a big Bee Gees fan, I was disappointed with this video.  I compared it to the Eagles Farewell Tour I video, which I purchased about 2 months ago.  The Eagles concert, in my opinion, was much better.   <br /> <br />The song arrangements and sound engineering were not of the same high quality as the Eagles concert.  I didn't think the backup band was as good either. <br /> <br />Several songs, some of which are among my favorites, were abbreviated versions, lasting only a minute or less.    <br /> <br />Barry's voice is showing his age.  At the time of this concert, 1997, he was over 50 years old and I should cut him some slack.  But the Eagles (of similar age) still sound pretty good. <br /> <br />The vocal harmonies are still great and the songwriting skills are amazing.  What a group. <br />

0800179501|5.0|This movie is way beyond the physical realm about Karate.  Though I am not an expert in Karate yet, it brings the spiritual essence of what Karate is about.  Mr. Miyagi is the type of teacher every kid (and even adult) wishes one can encounter when they are being coached.  Someone who takes a first glance of how Mr. Miyagi looks like would think he looks weird, not appealing ... yet, this man in the movie is full of spiritual wisdom, integrity of mind and spirit with mindfulness tools all wrapped around him.  Breathing, balancing (essentially it is the combination of centering and grounding) ... what a great way to teach kids and adults of how life is about.  Sometimes one needs to have faith about the teacher if teachers/coaches show competency, integrity, respect and compassion to self and others.  I am so glad Mr. Miyagi talks about Karate is about the mind (calmness of the mind) and the heart (full of integrity and compassion), not about the stomach (stomach... in Asian culture means it stores anger and fear ... also called as \\"chi of anger\\"... the air of anger and fear).    Though I still have to say ... 2 months of dedication and commitment to win a championship part is misleading... no matter how hard core the training is.  To master the skills of a black belt level takes some years of devotion and constant commitment.  This portion of the story line might mislead kids and adults about the fast-food pill of success... which is far from true in real life situation.  To master any skills (not just Karate), requires constant commitment, following through with a coach who demonstrates competency, integrity and compassion.  Yet, I suppose a movie can only do so much in bringing spiritual awareness about body, mind and soul.           Overall, it is a very spiritual awakening, inspiring movie.  Great job to every actor, actress and the crew behind the scenes filming.  This is certainly a film that deserves the applause from the many audiences.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I first watched \\"Office Space\\" on a laptop in a Tuscaloosa hotel with my future wife. We were on our way to a conference, and she suggested that we watch this movie. It wasn't too late in the evening, and the running time seemed reasonably short at approximately 90 minutes. I also figured that it would be pretty good, especially with Mike Judge as the writer and director. After having watched it several times since then, I am convinced that \\"Office Space\\" is one of the very best cinematic comedies made in recent years. <br /> <br />Watching \\"Office Space\\" seems especially therapeutic after dealing with craziness at work. This probably explains the film's broad appeal; it resonates with people who have needed to suffer bureaucratic B.S., the latest manifestations of \\"office speak,\\" and arbitrary rules at some point in their working lives. Of course, Judge himself drew upon his own memories of work in an office, which he finally escaped after hitting upon the idea for \\"Beavis and B*tt-head.\\" Although some people have criticized \\"Office Space\\" for not having enough \\"funny stuff,\\" they don't seem to understand the subtlety of Judge's humor, which leans towards the dry and sardonic. One could almost imagine Billy Wilder feeling at home with the plot, though he might have needed a little extra nudging to include the gangsta rap songs. <br /> <br />With a cast that includes no \\"big-name stars\\" (except Jennifer Aniston), no central performer clamors for attention with cloying \\"hilarity.\\" In fact, the quotidian nature of the characters actually enhances the humor. The characters in subordinate positions try to deal with inanities at work by stewing, fretting, and venting in private. Meanwhile, those with more power are content to reinforce the craziness because it guarantees their power, or because they are so entrenched in their positions that they don't recognize the arbitrary nature of the rules they enforce.  <br /> <br />The characters are also funny because they remindme of people I have encountered throughout my life. Granted, they come across as caricatures to a degree, but the characters still seem more real than those conjured up for overly facile yuck-fests. In our own lives, many of us probably think that we are \\"normal,\\" like the main character Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) or his girlfriend Joanna (Aniston). However, not everyone can be like Peter or Joanna... or at least our perceptions of them as \\"normal.\\" Peter's sudden \\"transformation\\" into a quasi-Zen warrior, as well as Joanna's semi-stoner attitude, might just put them way outside the mainstream. In any case, I've seen enough people who share similarities with one, or even several, of these characters: <br /> <br />- Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), Peter's passive-aggressive, narcissistic, and clueless Yuppie boss (complete with aviator glasses, power tie, and coffee mug) at Initech <br /> <br />- Michael Bolton (David Herman), Peter's nerdy coworker who just itches to unleash his internal Navy SEAL and gangsta <br /> <br />- Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), Peter's resourceful coworker who wants to \\"make it\\" in America <br /> <br />- Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), Peter's no-nonsense, no-collar neighbor and de facto confidant at the thin-walled Morningwood Apartments <br /> <br />- \\"The Bobs\\" (John C. McGinley and Paul Willson), coldly congenial external consultants hired by Initech to figure out how the company can \\"cut costs\\" <br /> <br />- Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle), the older Initech employee whose forced joviality barely disguises his anxiety about falling victim to The Bobs <br /> <br />- Stan (a well-disguised cameo by Judge himself), Joanna's flair-obsessed boss at the T.G.I. Friday's-like restaurant Chotchkies, which provides a non-office doppelgnger for Peter's work environment   <br /> <br />And yes, I've seen a few people who remind me of Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the put-upon office gnome with his barely audible stream-of-consciousness mumbling, coke-bottle glasses, outdated sense of non-fashion, and a passive-aggressive attitude matching that of Lumbergh (and that Lumbergh ultimately underestimates). Peter may be the story's main protagonist, but one could see Milton as an odd sort of antihero as well. His almost incoherent mumbling, mainly consisting of requests to clarify matters regarding his salary, his desk, and his red Swingline stapler, acts as a more personalized counterpoint to the double-talk and nonsensical policies that drive Initech. Albeit in extreme fashion, Milton also demonstrates that greed can only propel a business so far, and that an ultimate moral obligation to one's shareholders doesn't always pay off. <br /> <br />For \\"Office Space\\" aficianados, the \\"Special Edition with Flair\\" includes a 30 minute documentary that provides some insights into the making of the movie. Some of it might not seem like news to hardcore fans, but I learned a few new things: how Gary Cole came up with Lumbergh's voice; the \\"bons mots\\" Diedrich Bader improvised as Lawrence; how Stephen Root got around in thick glasses; where Ajay Naidu learned his dance moves; and the origin of the word a**clown. It also includes eight deleted scenes (some of which you might miss if you blink) and computer downloads. Alas, it does not include the animated \\"Milton\\" shorts created by Mike Judge in 1991, which provided the original inspiration for \\"Office Space.\\" That's about as disappointing as excluding \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" from the \\"Apocalypse Now Redux.\\" <br /> <br />Whether one gets \\"Office Space\\" with or without flair, I can guarantee a good laugh to anyone who has had to deal with any kind of work-related nonsense at some point in their lives. It might not change the world, but \\"Office Space\\" will probably remain an effective purgative for anyone who has encountered such situations. If nothing else, one can at least hope that the insights of \\"Office Space\\" will inform the ethics of up-and-coming managers, and make them prioritize the things that really should matter at work.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Nobody really took Madonna seriously untill this album came out. Often a great artist or band doesn't get recognized untill they release their breakthrough album. For Pink Floyd it was, \\"Dark Side Of the Moon\\". For Prince It Was, \\"Dirty Mind\\". Madonna redefined what a pop artist could do during the 80's and well into the 90's. Would Mariah Carey or Brittany Spears have ever become popular without her influence. Most likely not. <br /> <br />This is also back in a time where MTV videos actually had substance and vaule to them. \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Express Yourself,\\" and \\"Oh Father\\", all redefined the fact that video making could be an true art-form if done correctly. Of Course, now that so-called artists like 50 cent, Good Charlotte and Mariah Carey have taken over, video making has gone to the dogs. <br /> <br />The album opens with the pop classic, \\"Like A Prayer\\". It sounds like a typical love song but I think its actually a metaphor for speaking to God and finding spiritual peace; something that Madonna has been trying to do all her life. The video to this song was very controversial with Madonna making out with a black Christ figure, singing in a field of burning crosses, and displaying images of stigmata. The video was revolutionary and she (or nobody else for that matter) never made anything quite like it again. \\"Express Yourself\\", is another unforgettable video in which the world is divided into classes and nobody is allowed to cross over them. \\"Love Song\\", is a duet with Prince and, \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", is the happiest break-up song ever. Things change completely with haunting and heartbreaking number, \\"Promise To Try\\", which is about a single mother who must take care of her only child. <br /> <br />Things get happier with the hit single, \\"Cherish\\", and the almost Disney like song, \\"Dear Jessie\\", but things then get extremely dark with the ballad, \\"Oh Father\\". Possibly the darkest pop song ever recorded, it tells the tale of a young girl who loses her mother and must deal with her abusive father. The Black and White video that accompanys it is also very dark with its use of dark lighting and surreal effects. Things get bright again with the song, \\"Keep It Together\\", which is about sticking with your family and friends no matter what happens. The second to last song is another haunting ballad. A Spanish like song, \\"Spanish Eyes\\", is about the singer losing her lover to a war and not being able to deal with it. The last song is just Madonna having fun and pulling a joke on the listener. <br /> <br />As you can see, Madonna touches on almost every pop culture subject. While 50 Cent and Good Charlotte are singing about sex and utter nonsense, Madonna is singing about stuff that really matters. To see a great example of what pop music can extend to if done correctly go out and buy this album and give it a listen.  <br />
0307276902|4.0|I suspect that most of the people who object to this book started reading it expecting a typical writing style. I listened to the audio version of this book (all 10 hours of it!) and was very pleased with the style and rhythm of the text. Frey's style in this book uses repetition to emphasize the feeling and emotion of his experiences throughout recovery. Don't read this expecting a good flow of plot and sentence structure. Like Frey's own life, the style is somewhat disconnected, random, and defiant to traditionally accepted standards. As a result the book impacts the reader as an authentic account of the struggles, successes, and failures of temptation.
B000060MWU|1.0|This movie SUCKS!!! It was made with a $15 million budget, Obviously someone walked off with $14,999,900.00 in thier pocket. After watching the first ten minutes of this movie, I shoved a very sharp pencil through my eye. May only regret was that I only had one pencil. I now know why Robert Blake shot his wife!!! The only reason I am giving this movie one star, is because that is the lowest rating that can be given. Once again, THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0009JAENU|5.0|I grade my CD's based on how often I play them. I have not removed this recording from my CD player since I bought it. It just keeps becoming more enjoyable. Because of that, I rate this CD 5 stars and well worth it! This one has got to be one of Hilary's best. Power, brilliance and grace mark this entire recording. I have had the privilege of seeing Hilary and Natalie perform this music together so the CD also brings to life the memory of the flawless performances by these two on stage. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.
B000BB96MG|4.0|I enjoyed this remake because it went more in-depth in the story, I think it was equally as good or better than the original.  I still consider the the original to be a classic.  I think its insane to compare Willy Wonka with Michael Jackson, for the people who don't pay attention MJ likes kids while WW doesn't.  What people do for a little attention....
0553801503|2.0|I'll start by pointing out that I am a horrible reader.  I rarely finish a series that I start, and it takes a special story to hold my interest.  My \\"Bin of Forgotten Books\\" is littered with short stories, novels, trilogies, and epics that couldn't hold my attention - most notably, perhaps, King's Dark Tower series (quit in the middle of book 5) and Jordan's Wheel of Time (quit in the middle of 4). <br /> <br />That is where the first three Martin books shocked me.  Once I got into them, I rarely put them down.  I read them while I was eating, walking, getting ready, watching sports on TV, etc.  I was even on the website several times after I finished the third one to find out when this book would be released. <br /> <br />Feast started slow, but that's OK, I thought Game of Thrones started slow.  I expected Feast to take off eventually, like GoT, but it never did.   <br /> <br />A lot of the chapters, I thought, could have been summed up through \\"have you heard...\\"-type dialogues between characters, rather than making us sit through it.  The POV characters are also largely boring.  Brienne, for example, is a good non-POV character, but really not complex or interesting enough that I would have to be in her head to understand her.  I'll say that, in Storm of Swords, I thought Jaime's chapters were good, but weaker than all the others.  In Feast, Jaime's chapters are the best, but no better than they were in Storm, which, I suppose, shows what I thought of the other chapters and characters in Feast. <br /> <br />I guess the best way I can put it is - we all know friends or relatives who can tell great stories about things that have happened to them.  These people are like Tyrion, for example.  No matter what situation he was in, I was willing to go along for the ride.  But we also know people who have exciting stories to tell, but they tell it in such a way that it's not so interesting.  This is what's going on with the POV characters in Feast.  There's a good storyto tell, but we're hearing it from bland and predictable characters.  I felt like I was awkwardly forced into their heads, and as I read the story through these characters, it reminded me of being in a one-on-one situation with an acquaintence whose antics are only tolerable when they're in an indirect, large-group setting. <br /> <br />I'm still laboring through the end, but given my track record, I may never finish unless someone tells me that book 5 is as good as 1-3.

B000B5QWKG|5.0|A word of warning for customers who do want to listen to this CD in a CD player, not just a computer... <br /> <br />I was disappointed with the dualdisc format. The DVD side includes the temporarily addicting video of \\"Do You Want To\\" and some random inside-the-studio clips, as well as an interview, but after you have finished going through these features once they are pretty much useless. The CD side worked fine in my computer, but in a boombox and a portable player it started skipping and finally stopped in the last few songs. I wish that I had just bought the regular, single-sided disc, which in addition to working better would also include artwork on the disc, which, surprisingly, I really miss. <br /> <br />Anyway, I love this album and can hardly get past tracks 1-4 because I just want to listen to them over again.
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray is far and away one of the best artists around.  From start to finish this album delivers great music, an album that doesn't look for the hit single, but shows serious artistry in each and every song.   <br /> <br />You can't fault the artist for corporate machinations. The fact that SONY BMG screwed it up is forgiveable if you know your way around a computer.   <br /> <br />You can use a different OS (i.e. NON-windows - I used Gentoo) to rip the songs to computer and upload them to your iPod.  I will certainly be more discerning in my online purchases in the future - given all of the incidious things that Sony has been doing with the Content Protection software.   <br /> <br />I'd buy this album as a gift for friends if it wasn't for this single glaring fault. <br />
0446577383|1.0|This book is a loser on some many fronts that it is difficult to enumerate them all. Plot: stupid and unbelievable, Characters: cardboard cut-outs, Dialogue: juvenile, Description: Inane and used primarily for filler and to up the word count, I could go on but it would be too much like reading the book. Stay Away. This one is just for Baldacci's bank account.
0553801503|4.0|The expectations for this book were impossibly high, especially after a frustrating 5 year pause. In reality, this is not book 4 of the series, but book 3.5 or even 3.5a (with 3.5b to follow). <br /> <br />With all that said, I was very glad to reenter Martin's universe again. There is not much happening in terms of the plot, but we are introduced to the cultures of Dorne and the Iron Islands, and Brienne chapters (so disliked by some) give us an excellent ground-level view of a war-torn Vesteros (previously, this view was given in Arya chapters). <br /> <br />Writing is very good, as expected, though the cliffhangers at the end of nearly every PoV are a bit excessive. <br /> <br />Overall, a very good and absorbing book - hopefully the next one will be ready by early 2007, as promised. Well, at least we can hope.
0553801503|5.0|Epic fantasy at its best -- bloody, cynical, vivid, treacherous and very rarely merciful.    Though Martin does slow his narrative down by giving everyone down to the long-dead third cousin a name and epithet of his own, he also creates vivid, appealing characters. FEAST FOR CROWS features some of the characters whose perspectives I enjoy the most: Brienne, Jaime, Sam. Jaime, who could have been a stock villain, has become a really interesting character who often tries to do moral things, but never gets credit for it from anyone. His struggle to regain his swordsmanship and his mixed feelings for Cersei -- the closest the series has to a \\"villain\\", though many of her actions are understandable because these are well-written characters -- are effective and often moving. The book also features Arya, Sansa and Cersei (so the comments of a few reviewers that it does not feature important characters seems strange to me. Who's \\"important\\", anyway? The book is antiheroic. Pig boys are as important as princes.). The addition of new people at every turn and the plethora of names, often similar to each other, isn't the element of the series that I like the best, but Martin's vision is an epic one and has to be read as such.    I guess I think of it like this. SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a giant engine of war, a siege-engine, if you will. It takes a really long time to get all its parts geared up and moving together. But you know that when it fires, something's going down. Martin demonstrated his ability to deliver a narrative blow in earlier volumes and, even though FFC has a structurally transitional role, does so here as well.    But. Argh! I don't understand the publisher's actions.    If the second half is written, why is it going to take another year for it to be released? Why not have released it with FFC, even if bound separately? Or at least why not bring it out in the spring of 2006? The wait is going to drive me mad.    And then how many years is it going to take beforewe know what happened to Brienne, who was left -- hanging, or Arya, or the others whose storylines paused dramatically? The anticipation feels more like frustration at this point. I can wait -- impatiently -- for Martin to write, but waiting for the publisher is harder.

0553801503|2.0|After reading other reviews I am confused as to why many gave 5 out of 5 stars, then go on to voice complaints and list several limitations of the novel.  If you didn't like sections of the novel, why give it 5 stars! <br />Perhaps my expectations were too high, like many I waited eagerly, checking GRRM's website at least a few times a month, until Nov 8th and the release of Feast.  The misgivings of the novel I found summed up quite nicely by Ross Blackman's review, so I will not repeat them.   <br />Can the series be salvaged by upcoming books in the series? I could not care less.  I don't care when Dragons is released, I'm not going to hold my breath nor pay $28.00 for it.  Maybe in 10 years I will see it in a bargain book bin at a used bookstore and pick it up, because somewhere in the back of my mind the title and author sound vaguely familiar. <br />
B00005JNJV|5.0|The past Batman movies have been mostly disappointments for me, so I didn't bother to see this one in the theater.  Last week, my father gave the DVD to me as a present.  I didn't expect much, so I was really surprised and pleased to see that this is actually a movie and not an exercise in foolishness. <br /> <br />First of all, the character of Batman is really well developed.  In previous movies, the idea of Bruce Wayne dressing up as Batman never seemed believable, but in this film, the steps toward becoming Batman are well outlined.  If you're looking for a good Batman movie, this is the best one yet.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Although this sometimes gets overlooked by the casual fan, this is their masterpiece. While their debut and 1984 are really great, the people who say that those two are Van Halen's best, probably haven't heard Fair Warning. There's no filler on this CD, and every track is a killer. The dark sound of Fair Warning doesn't make it depressing or anything, and it's still a great album to party and get drunk to. Just like all the others VH CDs with DLR! My personal favorites are \\"Dirty Movies,\\" \\"Hear About It Later,\\" \\"One Foot Out The Door,\\" \\"Unchained,\\" \\"So This Is Love?\\" ... aw hell every single one of them!! I definitley recommend Fair Warning to every fan of rock, or fan of music in general.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Walking out of the movie Serenity I remarked to a friend of mine that I was really impressed and hoped they'd make a sequel. A day later he loaned me the DVDs for the television show. About an hour and a half later I bought the boxed set for myself. It's become one of my all time favorites yet I don't even remember it being advertised back when it originally aired. I'm truly impressed and that is no easy feat since I typically read books for entertainment, and even mediocre speculative fiction books usually blow the socks off of even the best television and movie productions of that genre.<br /><br />There are thousands of reviews already published on this site so you probably have the plot down pat. I'll add that it's much like Babylon 5: good acting (occasionally even great acting), a believable universe, intricate plots, and truly original scripts, all wrapped into a very creative, totally fun package. If you liked the movie and have not already seen the series you've got to get a hold of a copy. It's fantastic entertainment.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B000069AUI|2.0|Coldplay is the most overrated and BORING band of our generation. When \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" was released 3 years ago, the music critics declared them to be \\"the next Radiohead\\", which couldn't be further from the truth. Radiohead has made a name for themselves over the years with their relentless experimenation, extremely broad range (not many bands can span from AC-DC to Aphex Twin), brilliant abstract lyrics, and their creative, uncompromising music. On the other hand, Coldplay is bragging about how their song \\"Low\\" (off of their new album \\"X-Y\\") was so revolutionary and groundbreaking for them, because it had a faster tempo.<br /><br />\\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" is a VERY ironic album title, because the music does the exact opposite. Instead of being glorious and life affirming, it is sluggish, energy-draining elevator music. I can't listen to this album for about 10 minutes before I decide that it's naptime. It tries its hardest to be beautiful, and sometimes (such as the gorgeous chiming guitars on \\"In My Place\\") it works. But the overly mellow mood of the CD hurts it alot. There is very little \\"rock\\" on here. I laugh my ass off every time someone says that \\"Politik\\" and \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face\\" are Coldplay's \\"hard rock\\" songs. Just because the guitars are jarring enough to snap you out of the depressing insomnia that the rest of the album lulls you into does not mean that it \\"rocks hard\\".<br /><br />Coldplay seems to follow the exact same strategy that every other Britpop band of the last 12 years has followed: Write overblown ballads (does \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\", \\"Good Souls\\" or \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" ring a bell?) that try to be deep and meaningful, but are more likely than not very annoying. It's a tired formula, guys. Let it rest in peace. I haven't heard anything here that U2, The Verve, and \\"The Bends\\"-era Radiohead haven't done a thousand times better.<br /><br />This is not alternative rock. This is adult contemporary Britpop for people who also listen to Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson. It's quite dull, and there is nothing imaginative or risktaking about it, not even in a genre as derivative and flaky as Britpop.en to Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson.

0553801503|3.0|Let me start off by saying that George R. R. Martin is one of my favorite authors and \\"A Game of Thrones\\" one of my favorite books. Since I've read well over 3,000 of them over the last 25 years that's saying a lot. I pre-ordered this book well over a year ago, yet as most know the publication date kept sliding. When it finally arrived I was soooo excited to get started reading it. And then I did...<br /><br />Man, oh man, this is one big fat disappointing book. It's a collection of semi-related chapters of various minor characters but lacks cohesion as a complete tale. The prose is up to Martin's legendary magnificence but the plot is either too complex to understand or it's just not there. Yes, I understand that the author wanted this work to be twice as large to make a more complete story but let's face it, some things really can be made pithier without hurting the tale. Wonderful, creative writing is simply not good enough, in and of itself, to carry a book, especially one as long and complex as this one. Less words of more import would have been preferable. The pacing is way, way too slow.<br /><br />I loved the first three books in the series, which is why I'm so very disillusioned with this one. I'll guess I'll have to wait for paperback before picking up the next one... sigh. As the second half of this monster tome I can't imagine that it would be much better.
B0000667RO|5.0|If you are a Bryan Adams fan, you probably will want to get this collection just because you will want to hear the direction Bryan has gone in.

0060934719|4.0|A narrative re-telling of John Donne's \\"Song,\\" \\"Stardust\\" is a fairy tale chronicling the experiences of an impressionable adolescent who, out of love, chases after a shooting star. His jaunt becomes an epic journey into a world called Faerie where the fantastic is quite commonplace.<br /><br />Although the conclusion was a bit of a groaner, this is a fairy tale, albeit of the adult variety, and inevitably borrows from the genre's various components (indeed, the novel's underlying structure and chronology eerily subscribe to Propp's tenets in the \\"Morphology of the Folktale\\"). While there aren't any big ideas floating around here, that certainly doesn't diminish from the book's readability. It's quite nice to kick back and read a great yarn about that magical land `over the hills and far away' replete with unicorns, witches, and elves. This is Gaiman doing what he does best: tell a heckuva of a story.<br /><br />Because the book is short and so easy to read, most readers could probably polish \\"Stardust\\" off in one sitting. However, I'd recommend purposefully taking one's time and soaking in the sights and sounds of Faerie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I went to see it the day it came out not knowing what to expect. I hadn't seen any trailers or any commercials. I thought it was awesome. It won't win any awards or I don't expect it to. But it was enjoyable and I really cared about the characters... so much so that after the movie I barrowed the series from my friend and watched it all in the next 72 hours. There are some jokes that I get more know that I have seen the series. And it is better having seen the series, but the movie got me into the series. So it isn't just a film for fans. Just kick back, have no expectations and you will enjoy this movie. Also I found the trailers after I saw the movie... I felt they misrepresented the film, so don't base your opinion of the film off the trailer.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is by far the best show I have ever seen and heard.  The soundtrack is what sold me first, before I bought tickets.  Both Kristin and Idina deliver such powerful preformances which send chills down your spine when you listen to them.  This soundtrack is the reason why my speakers are shot in my car.  I can't get enough of it.
B000055ZDT|5.0|the name of the album is DOPETHRONE and the name of the band is ELECTRIC WIZARD! that should be enough for you to want to buy this!  <br /> <br />need more encouragement?? this is possiblly the heavist album i have ever bought in my entire life!!! you seriously have to turn the bass on your stereo down to around negative three or four for this not to be excruciatingly heavy.  <br /> <br />the songs range from very very doom to straight up stoner jams (think a heavier sleep). the album flows seemlessly from song to song and if you aren't paying attention you'll completely lose track of where in the album you are. on top of all that they actually have totally awesome lyrics!! <br /> <br />my only qualm with this is that because it's so heavy i can't turn it up as loud as i'd like if i want to keep my speakers in one piece! normally i'd be psyched on that, i love heavy music! but, it seriously is just so heavy that you're going to wreck your speakers if you're not careful. also, there are points that it's really hard to discern whats going on over all the distortion, feedback, etc.
0307276902|5.0|A totally moving account of a living hell.  I read through this so quickly unable to stop to hardly get any sleep.  I was taken by the way he speaks of the love he has felt in his life. The beautiful girl with the Artic blue eyes and strands of silk.  When he recounts this love he has had to Lilly it is just beautiful, then when he tells Lilly of how he had hoped the Girl with the Artic blue eyes had missed him over Christmas break, it is such a strong rare love.  A breathtaking passionate sort of love that anyone would hope to ever encounter.  \\"When I see you the World stops,\\" sort of love.  But the most moving, absolute most incredible part of the book is when he rescues Lilly- I was totally sobbing-it is so moving. <br /> <br />Highly recommmended to anyone!!!

B000000993|5.0|This is my favorite album from Tool.  For those of us that prefer to connect with music, instead of just listening to it, you will feel everything that James Maynard wants you to feel, and if you close your eyes, visualize everything he wants you to see.

B00004Y7SF|1.0|I bought this CD having high expectation and was dissapointed with the whole CD.
B00005CDNI|5.0|I own all the Abba albums, and this one, recorded at the very peak of their popularity in the late 70's, shows all the reasons why they were the kings and queens of pop. <br /> <br />Abba is often considered by those who don't know them as a \\"disco\\" group.  The truth is that this is the only album where Abba tried out disco, with stunning results.  \\"Voulez-vous\\" is quite simply one of the greatest disco singles ever recorded.  It masterfully tells the story of a pick-up in a disco, and lyrically it blows most other disco songs out of the water.  And the bonus track \\"Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie,\\" released as a single in support of the now unavailable \\"Greatest Hits Vol 2\\" is equally good.  Madonna knows a good hook when she hears one, and borrowed one of the all-time great ones from \\"Gimmie\\" for \\"Hung Up.\\" <br /> <br />The rest of the album moves deftly through the European music styles that form the backbone of most Abba music.  Folk ballads (Chiquitita and I have a dream), country meets a motown backbeat in \\"Angeleys,\\" the sultry pop sophistication of \\"The King Has Lost His Crown,\\" the hooked-on-classics opening of \\"As Good As New.\\"  This is Abba songwriting and studio craft at its finest.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|When people go into a movie theatre they expect to be entertained. Audiences want to be scared, amused, curious, sad, and hopefull. Believe it or not, this film provides all of those elements and then some. I've read the comments by people who gave passed this film on as either \\"too scary to children\\" or \\"just plain boring with no plot\\" And I agree with several people who have responded to such comments. <br /> <br />This film isn't going to give you instant gratification halfway through. If you don't have two hours to spare then you aren't going to understand what this movie is about. Sure the plot was invisible at times, but I don't think the point of the movie was to have the audience follow a plot. The point was to reveal or in some cases remind people of the simplistic faith or child like view we once had in our lives. <br /> <br />Think of the characters themselves and what they represent. Hero Boy reminds us of people who are caught in between faith and doubt. Do we trust what we cannot see? Who is to say? Hero Girl shows the stronger side of faith and believing in what is not readily seen to the human eye. Childlke faith personified into a little girl. Lonely Boy represent those who doubt because they haven't truly experienced the joys of life or  have had tragedies happen to them from an early age so they learn to only trust themselves, but that ends up leaving them...lonely. Then are those who are the Know-It-All character who claim to take everything at face value (much like the critics and cynics of this film).  They want to know it all because what they don't know scares them.  <br /> <br />I'm 21 years old and I haven't had nearly enough experiences in life, but I can say that I had been so busy growing up that I had forgotten that there was a part of me that was once simple, happy and appreciated the joys of just believing that things were true. That is until life makes you grow up and tries to distort your beliefs (much like HoboMan in this film). <br /> <br />When I first saw this movie my eyes widened with every new frame. It was the first time since my childhood that I can remember sitting in the audience with my mouth open and my eyes stretched out as far as they can be. I was stunned, by the artistry and complexity of the story. I was a kid again for two hours. It was like an old friend who I hadn't seen in a long time came back to visit. It was an amazing film.  <br /> <br />It's a train ride, a leap of faith, a test of the human spirit. It's a ride and like the movie says: \\"It's not about where the train takes you, what matters is that you get on.\\" THAT, my friend, is what this movie is about. Not being entertained by slapstick humor or satirical sarcasm, but remembering that part of you that resembles the kids in the movie. Believe.  <br /> <br />Bravo on a fantastic film.

0802130208|1.0|After reading this lousy book I am mystified that anyone could think highly of it.

B000003S0I|5.0|Is rock music an art form or just nice to listen to? Do you always like a tune the first time you hear it? For how long after that do you still enjoy listening to it? Does it surprises you or only make you want to dance? Does it make you feel something every time you listen to it or only the first time? Is rock a decorative art? Not loud enough? Too loud? Perhaps. But is it talking to you? It may take a while to enjoy King Crimson's music and some may never get there as they are not looking for what's on offer here. Those who like it now, will however still have considerable joy in listening to it over the many years to come. Worth the experience. You might discover something that you have never heard before. And frankly that in itself is a treat given this music's age.
B00005JLEU|3.0|I expected to totally love this movie based upon the glowing reviews, but I am totally disappointed.  The story is just weird. I watched it with my husband and my eight year old daughter.  We all thought it was weird within the first 20 minutes, but I wanted to really give it a try.  We watched for a total of 90 minutes and gave up. None of us were into it, and my daughter was kind of freaked out by it.  It's now bedtime and she's scared.  I'd be careful with this one if your kids are sensitive like mine.

630460291X|2.0|I give this movie two stars but Alan Rickman's performance five stars.  I have heard for many years that the only reason to watch this movie is to catch Alan Rickman's performance.  Boy, is that the truth.  His character is so alive compared with the rest of the cast (except for Morgianna, who was also good).  This is a pretty standard script, one could guess what would happen at every turn.  Kevin Costner is so hit or miss with his movies, and this was definitely a big miss for him.  Morgan Freeman is truly wasted.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character is tough girl one minute and screaming helpless girl the next. The writer's could not seem to make up their minds regarding what they wanted her to do.  I found myself fast forwarding to any scene with Alan Rickman in it. He is completely over the top, hilarious, horrible and sympathetic.  You feel the movie let down when he is not on the screen.

The entire mood of the picture, from cinematography, to dialogue, to acting, is a faithful and stunning conversion of the novel to the movie.  Each carefully composed scene, each piece of artfully stunted dialogue, the stylised yet substantial characters, all ring true to the directors vision of an artful and accurate translation from one media to the other.   Yes it's violent, yes it has stereotypes, get over it. That's what the movie is, and if you don't like it don't watch it.  I thought it was stunning and original.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|Yucky. Boring, sappy and longwinded with a messy story and lame songs that last for an eternity. Feel like being bored to sleep?

B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Is this a joke. Can people really listen to this garbage. That is what i was asking myself when I heard this CD. The guy who plays guitar is THE worst singer and looks like a possesed rat. The singer is a good singer but some of the songs either make me want to lagh or kill people. I mean this is pretty bad they cant even write good lyrics I mean I dont not like metal but this makes me want to listen to anything other than this stupid horrible thing called Mezmerized. Do Not BUy

B00009XITP|4.0|\\"What a Girl Wants\\" is a FAIRY TALE (insert \\"Parent Trap\\" here) so those who do not like that type of story need not watch, but just being a fairy tale is no basis for criticism. It is an updated remake of 1958's \\"The Reluctant Debutante\\" starring Sandra Dee and Rex Harrison, which itself was based on a 1956 play by William Douglas Home. Home is partially credited with both screenplays although he died in 1992. The basic premise is even older as the humble child who discovers a royal parent is a staple of ancient fairy tales.    The current version is a pretty decent effort, you could even say that it is 2/3's of an excellent movie. It starts off nicely and proceeds in a very entertaining manner well past the midway point. You are just about to conclude that this is an extremely underrated film when the wheels fall off (insert Colin Firth whisking his daughter away on a motorcycle), from that point the film wobbles lamely along until it thankfully recovers its balance just before its final scene.    The only other major problem is the clich Yank-Brit characterizations and the exploitative use of the Royal Family in several scenes. Yanks are fun and funky, Brits are staid and stuffy, most upper class Brits are evil incarnate-with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. You are warned about it going in, this general stupidity is reflected by the promotional poster of an American flag t-shirt between the British guards. The exuberance of Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) would have played better if the other performances were toned down a few notches. Doubles of and references to the Royal Family are completely unnecessary and simply distract from what is supposed to be a father-daughter-bonding story.    The best scene happens early, Daphne and her mother are working a local wedding when she discovers the missing groom passed out under a table. She puts ice down his shirt and when he emerges frantically twisting around to remove it, Daphne signals her mom's band to play \\"Shout\\" and then mimics the groom's movements.     I see no basis for the criticism of Amanda Bynes in this film. She plays her high energy self and successfully ratchets back a few notches for the serious scenes. In essence director Dennie Gordon has her play two characters which is the basis of the story's theme as her character must reluctantly conform and work at being someone she is not. Under Gordon's direction and working with a skilled ensemble Bynes nails the character so well that it is hard to image anyone else in the role. She is not on Brittany Murphy's level yet but she progressing nicely. Two similiar scenes really play to her strengths, the fashion runway scene and the grand entrance to the party for Peach & Pear, the film is worth watching just for those moments.    The widescreen edition DVD is a great value as it has some excellent special features including an unaffected commentary by Bynes. They had a lot of audio problems during production and Bynes provides very good behind the scenes information about what the actors had to do to correct this after the actual shooting was completed.     Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Wow these guys used to be so good.  They ae the biggest sellouts i have ever see.  If you think this is punk rock wow. They have 1 punk song on here called St. jimmy you have probablly heard all the rest on the album which is why you should not buy this. Let me tell you that Jesus of suburbia is a great song but that cannot change this poppy emo cd. what happened to Dookie age.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|the lyrics are wonderful and their message is as good as always. yet the overall feel of the album is just shy of the greatness of toxicity. some of that comes from the fact that Serj's incredible voice is used much less here than before.
B000002KIE|5.0|I cant belive people who put bad reveiws they must like rap. This is top three along with rammones and clash. If you like punk rock then you have to own this. Oh and to the guy who said the biggest joke to rock and roll you are the biggest idiot I have ever seen as far as im concerned this is the best thing that has ever happened to rock and roll so shut your mouth.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I love this cd it's happen to be just what people need. It put you in the right mood. I am so glad this cd was put out it puts your mind at ease. All the songs here are wonderful and so well done. It's just what the doctor ask for.<br /><br />Thanks Alicia
B0007TKNII|5.0|If I could give this movie ten stars I would; it's a shame we're only allowed five. <br /> <br />I rented this movie on the recommendation of my aunt; her only complaint was that it was too long. On the contrary, if the movie had been as long as the Lord of Rings trilogy, I would have watched it in it's entirety without complaint. <br /> <br />With that said, I will list those things that I truly loved about the movie. Be warned, there are spoilers: <br /> <br />1. Butler was magnificent and mysterious as Phantom, aka Eric. Many professional singers have snubbed him.......let them. I'm not an \\"artist\\", but nonetheless, thought his singing was jaw-dropping. (I'm going to buy the soundtrack too)  He was no Michael Crawford, but who cares! I can think of many movies that were re-done with new actors and were masterpieces, i.e. Robert Powell from Jesus of Nazareth to James Caviezel in \\"The Passion...\\" (obviously those weren't musicals, but you get my point). His singing was powerful, full of yearning, raw at times, angry, passionate, and reaches into your soul (especially if you're a woman).  <br />2.  Gerard was younger in the movie than the book version... WHO CARES, he was old enough to be a father figure/mentor, and young enough to be a romantic interest. Yuck, who wants to see a fifty year old seduce a teenager.  <br />3.  Rossum and Wilson were great, except for Rossum's continuous trance-like expression almost throughout the entire movie. I didn't like Raoul's character as most people, but only because he took Christine away from Phantom. I found many reviewers calling him wimpy. That is hardly the case, from the beginning of the movie, he fearlessly attempted to be her guardian, that's hardly spineless. <br />4. Loved the flashback sequences, especially the beginning, it was spine-tingling, you're thinking... oh boy, we're in for a wonderful ride.  <br />5. I had no problem with Eric/Phantom having only a quarter of his face deformed. Many negative reviewers critized this saying he looked like he had only a \\"skin rash\\". Oh brother, what an understatement. If this man were walking down the street, whether it be 1800 or the present time, there was ENOUGH deformity to draw attention and probably scare many people. <br />6.  I loved the fact that although this man is deformed, obsessive, selfish (until the end) and kills, you still want him to end up with the girl!! What's even more disturbing, many of us would still want him.  <br />7. The sets were beautiful and mesmerizing; the music is still swimming in my head, and will be for some time. <br /> <br />Now for the things I didn't like or didn't understand about the movie: <br /> <br />1. The masquerade scene didn't give enough \\"glory\\" to the phantom as it should have; his \\"entrance\\" wasn't spectacular as it should have been. <br />2. Didn't like the Phantom losing the swordfight. What is that all about; he is supposed to be invincible, always escaping and having something up his sleeve. <br />3. Why does she sneak out to visit her father's grave? Raoul was right there guarding the door, yet she snuck by him. Was she secretely hoping that the Phantom would show up? <br />4.  She seemed too fickle, to coin the phrase \\"love the one you're with\\". But then, it is a movie about a love triangle. <br />5.  During the \\"Point of No Return\\" the camera kept going to the dancers in the background. They were terrible, dancing grotesquely (if thats even a word) and a distraction; it broke the momentum of Phantom and Christine. Everytime I watch this scene, it's like hurry up, go back to P & C. <br />6.  Why would Phantom give her Raoul's engagement ring, after he has abducted her, you'd think he'd have his own special ring for her, after all he had everything else. <br /> <br />Someone made an excellent point earlier that it was only at the end that Eric/Phantom truly loved Christine. Only after Christine \\"commits\\" to Phantom, puts on the ring while wearing the wedding dress, kisses him tenderly while caressing his deformed face, does he give her up, displaying the ultimate act of love. She gives him the ring back in the next scene. Was that to signify that she was really \\"his\\" inwardly, and outwardly going with Raoul, or was it her way of saying goodbye, here is a momento of what we had.  You really feel like Christine would have gone with phantom had he not been murderous and so obsessive. <br /> <br />Lastly, the scene at the graveyard, Raoul, very sorrowful, leaves the Persian Monkey with Cymbals on her gravestone. Is he at that moment finally conceding that Phantom owned her heart, by giving Christine one of Phantom's most prized posessions? I have to wonder since the very next scene we see the rose and the ring.  <br /> <br />Well, that is my interpretation. This movie leaves the viewers with questions thus leaving it to you to interpret (like what happened to Phantom after he exits at end? What was the marriage like, was it happy? Did Phantom ever contact her again).  <br /> <br />I wish ALW had used more creative license and changed the ending, but then, that's just me. (I know I'll get blasted for making this statement) I think most Phantom fans would have hated that. I like Hollywood endings, there's enough sadness in the real world to deal with. <br /> <br />Despite my criticism, I highly recommend this movie and buying it. It's at the top of my Christmas list!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0099474425|5.0|I heard wonderful things about Georgette Heyer and decided to give one of her novels a whirl.  I heard Heyer wrote mostly Regency romances, so I was surprised to see that this one is actually a Georgian romance.  I am not a big fan of the Georgian period because I don't like the elaborate clothing and I have a difficult time picturing men wearing powdered wigs, tights and corsets, but The Convenient Marriage is one of the most endearing and most hilarious period pieces I have ever read!  Heyer had me in stitches during some scenes.  The Earl of Rule feels it is time to get married and asks for society darling Lizzie Winwood's hand in marriage.  Lizzie isn't interested in Lord Rule. She does want to marry a wealthy man, but she also wants to be in love with whoever she decides to marry. So her sister Horatia (Horry) takes her place.  Horry isn't your typical heroine.  She has a very bad stutter, is plain in appearance and has a rather particular sense of humor.  Will those qualities endear her to Lord Rule or will he run a mile?  There are many hilarious twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />I have never laughed so much reading a period novel.  Since most authors have to keep with the times, attempts at humor in historicals aren't as funny as contemporary efforts.  This isn't the case here.  There are so many funny moments that I still smile when I think of them.  Horry is such a wonderful heroine.  Her sense of humor is compelling and she is remarkable in spite of her plainness.  It is always refreshing to read about a plain heroine instead of a drop-dead gorgeous one.  Her stuttering was difficult to follow at times and became annoying after a while though.  Lord Rule is also great.  I fell in love with him.  He's my idea of the perfect man.  Crosby Drelincourt is an awesome character as well.  He made me laugh during various scenes.  The language of the novel is quite interesting.  Even though it is set during the 1770s, the novel reads more like a Regency romance instead of a Georgian one, something I found odd.  I wouldn't say the historical references aren't accurate, more like she made the period sound a little too festive, not unlike Regency England.  All in all, this is a wonderful historical romp and I am glad I gave this wonderful author a whirl.  I heard Georgette Heyer was an author during the 1930s and was born around the turn of the twentieth century.  I had no idea about this until I read her bio.  So, I suppose her novels are probably considered classics then.  I shall give all of her books a whirl.ce instead of a Georgian one, something I found odd.

B0000ADY9I|5.0|Robert Johnson would have been proud... if not a little shocked at how far real southern rock has come since his time.<br /><br />While there might not be anything new as far as content goes, this CD is the best compilation of all those songs you know and love from The Allman brothers. If you are either new to the Allman Brothers or do not own the other Fillmore releases, this CD is a must buy. Despite some negative reviews regarding the deluxe edition, it sure does have some enhanced sound so this is the CD to buy if you don't own the songs already somehow.<br /><br />Key songs on the CD include Stormy Monday, Statesboro Blues, In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed (which sounds ten times better than any other release I've heard of it for some reason), and Midnight Rider. Great songs for a great compilation... a bit pricy, I know, but well worth it I assure you!!!<br /><br />Probably one of the greatest music compilations ever... certainly the best as far as southern rock goes. The second CD is much shorter than the first but includes some extended songs - for example the well-known extended live version of Whipping Post (a song which is downright amazing).<br /><br />Amazing stuff, much better reviews can be found on the site from music enthusiasts with much more experience in southern rock than I have but all and all this CD was well worth giving my 5 stars.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|It's so hard to believe that it has been 37 years since the final farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall for Cream. What a fitting venue for a reunion to take place. Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker have (I believe) done the impossible. They settled all(or almost all) their differences, and performed a fantastic group of reunion shows ever. Where most reunions are usually nostalgic, and happy, and void of any substance, Cream proved not only can they still play, but play with energy, originality, and vitallity. Anyone lucky enough to get tickets to these long sold out shows got a real treat. Eric Clapton has not played with this intensity for years. Since it was his idea to pull this off and put the group back together, he knew the odds were great. Because of this he reached the highest heights of guitar playing. Some of the most beautiful guitar solos I have ever heard. Because instrumentation was at a bare minimun (only guitar,bass, and drums), he knew he had to pull this off or else. I believe he hasn't played like this since his Derek and The Dominos period. It's also true that while Jack Bruce was ill last year and does not look too good here(several times he was leaning on a stool), his bass playing was nothing short of phenominal. And check out his blazing harmonica and vocals on \\"Rollin and Tumblin\\". Pure ecstasy. And Ginger Baker. Never before has he played so smoothly and fluidly as he does here. His vocals on \\"Pressed Rat And Warthog\\" were very interesting, and I got a good laugh at his \\"Party Political Broadcast\\" line at the end of the song. Where, during the original Cream period he played with thunder and heavy power, this has now been replaced with more smoother drumming and precision(he does a great solo on \\"Toad\\"), which I do not at all object to. These men are all in their early to mid 60's and it is not surprising that they do not play exacly like they did 35 years ago. Anyone expecting this will be disapointed. I look at it as Cream 2005,not 1968. On this dvd they played almost all their hits except for \\"I Feel Free\\" which Jack Bruce wanted to do but he realized they never could play with the same power of the original version, and for reasons that I still can't figure out \\"Strange Brew\\" which is one of their biggest hits. However, this is a very minor complaint. They do great versions of \\"Badge\\", \\"Politician\\", \\"White Room\\", and of course \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", along with many other great tunes. Also one brand new song. Well, it's not exactly new. \\"Stormy Monday\\" ,however, was never performed by Cream before so in a way it is a new song. Their version can stand proudly next to the Allman Brothers version. Recorded in high definition and with gorgeous 5.1 surround sound audio, you\\"ll see and hear Cream like never before. If you have the proper speaker setup, you can hear Ginger Bakers drums rolling all around you. And unlike attenting the concert and seeing them live but so far away, this is like having a front row seat. All in all one of my top 3 favorite concert performances. This should be viewed by all the new so called bands out there to watch how to really perform blues and rock with the power and originality of the real masters. Long live CREAM.2005,not 1968.

B00005JNTX|5.0|I am not usually a fan of comic books, but this movie was done so well that it didn't really matter.<br /><br />Very absorbing, fascinating, outrageously twisted over the top graphic violence---but not all that gruesome actually, since the camera usually pulls away from the actual carnage in progress.  It's the mental cruelty of various characters at various moments that lingers, not the physical actions so much.<br /><br />What's striking is just how utterly dark, no \\"dark\\" is too weak a word, utterly BLACK of a world this film pulls you into.  Totally amoral sadistic savage anarchy, there are of course good and bad guys but even the good guys are just a few shades less twisted.  And it's saavy, in the socioeconomic and sociopolitical sense---we see a world of vast corruption and cruelty underneath the everyday sucker's illusion of normalcy and respectability.<br /><br />The all-star cast shines, even cinematic lightweights like Jessica Alba are well-directed enough not to screw things up.  Like the \\"Kill Bill\\" movies, you have to approach this film as mainly an excercise in style and genre, it is not meant to be judged in any sort of larger real-world context and best of all doesn't try to be more than what it is...a supremely original and entertaining 2 hours!
B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie was great. An storm that is going to take over the world, check. Crappy acting and love sences, a big check, a tocken black actor, check check check! So you have Jake Gyllenhall (?) running around being smart with all the smart kids being smart at a smart convention. This was Jakes hardest roll yet playing a smart kid. Then you have some guy (forgot his name) being all smart and telling everyone that the world is going to technicly emplode. Yay. So then he messes up and finds out that the world is ending like in 3 days and everybody has to get out from the north. No one belives him untill everything smart getting frozen and people dye! Go special effects!! So then they are trapped in New York and the love story develops between the person Jake didthe smart team for. Then,onme of the gets sick and then they have to go on  the boat that floated to the front of the library. They get on it and they were carring animals (i think) and they find all sorts of goodies. Then the dogs attack! AHHH!!!So slowly stuff like that is going on and the world is ending which shows like sence of helicopters flying and freezing in midair and crashing. Good stuff. So everything is bad and then they finally get to NY and find his fun in the library and then send them to mexico!   Jared
B00005R2M3|5.0|The first English-language album from Colombian-born Shakira is an exceptional album. Shakira blends beauty and talent into one incredible package. While it features a couple of the inevitable fillers (\\"Poem for a Horse\\" is the album's low point), the rest is great stuff. The standout song on this collection is, without a doubt, \\"Whenever, Wherever.\\" This song (the first single from this album) is epic in scope, lyrically and musically speaking.<br /><br />In closing, this album is a great addition to anyone's music collection.<br /><br />Grade: A+

630512762X|5.0|This is a terrific convergence of talent in front of the camera and behind it.  John Woo in only his second American feature after his successes in Hong Kong(\\"The Killer\\", \\"Hard Boiled\\").  John Travolta trying to continue his momentum after his umpteenth comeback that began with \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  Nicolas Cage fresh from his Oscar triumph with \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" but expanding into the action genre with \\"The Rock\\".  This is inarguably Woo's best American film and holds it's own with the Hong Kong classics.  There is no denying that Woo has few peers in his ability to stage exciting action scenes.  What's impressive here is that he manages to weave them successfully into a storyline that has so many intricate plot strands.  Travolta and Cage are more than up to the challenge of switching personas.  On more than one occasion they seem to playfully riff off each other's style.  Though serious in tone the film contains a little bit of dark humor.  There are few action films that approach the artistry that's on display here.
B00005JO17|4.0|If you saw \\"Chicken Little\\" in 3D you'll understand why I gave this a 4. The 3D was really very good, and certainly free of ghosting images.The Story seemed to be very much geared to a <br />formula,a kind of \\"written by committee\\" feel to it.Story had almost nothing from the original childrens folk tale,but instead was more of a \\"barnyard animal version of \\"War of the Worlds\\". <br />Chicken,Fish Out-OF-Water were cute.The father, played by <br />Gary Marshall,sounded like a very old chicken-man,not the father of a youngster. Someone under 50 should have played the character. Getting back to the fairly high 4 rating...It was the <br />promise of what can be done in the future with 3D animation when <br />the writing is up to par, and the film is actually conceived to play in 3D, where \\"Chicken\\" was a \\"last minute\\" decision to go with 3D as a conversion. King Kong is apparently getting the same 3D treatment,I think that will be better. Just for the record, I think more than half of all future animation films will be released in 3D,likely most eventually, because it brings something more to the animation,s sense of reality. Frankly cartoon 2D animation was always hard for me to watch after age 9, <br />even with great story-telling like, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or <br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\", the 3D goes well with the CGI animation. <br />I guess with real \\"3D\\" being back on the scene, the recent misuse of the \\"3D\\" term for \\"CGI\\" will have to go away!!! <br /> <br />
B0000041LL|5.0|I can't add much to the praise stated over and over here----but I must say the warmth and deep feeling brought out by this quartet makes this set consistantly rewarding.<br /><br />The \\"Quartetto Serioso\\" still blows me away every time I hear it.  And the bright pluckiness (pun intended) of the first movement of the 'Harp\\" quartet always lifts my spirits.  I only mention these 2 because these solitary quartets are somewhat overlooked and undervalued, it seems.<br /><br />The Lindsays (some others too) tend to be more speedy and energetic----but this isnt always what is desired.  I prefer the Lindsays in Op. 130's Presto, which is really quick, light and whimsical---and just has more sparkle than the Italians. But I have a feeling a boxed set of all 16 quartets with the Lindsays (and I hope they do this some day!) would have more shortcomings than this set.<br /><br /> In the Razumovsky no.3, I would recommend the Budapest quartet's 1960 recording over the Italians, mainly because of their performance of the strange 2nd movement. The Budapest quartet often sounds cold and detached-----and this is a cold, weird movement-----so they are perfect, in this case!<br /><br />I must also commend the fine design of this boxed set. I like the neat little envelopes containing the cd's, rather than the typical plastic box with loose cd's flopping around and falling out when you open it, hinges that come undone, etc., etc.!!
B00006FDCD|4.0|'It' is a wonderful novel; one of King's best, and a real horror classic. It contains more depth and ingenuiety than most of his more recent (though still effective) horror offerings like 'Bag of Bones' and 'Black House', and a far more palpable sense of tension and mounting terror. <br /> <br />As a movie - or, rather, a TV Miniseries, because there's a big difference - \\"It\\" also works well, up to a point. Retelling the tale of seven childhood friends who rid their hometown of Derry from an unspeakable child-killing monster, the friends must reassemble as adults to finally end the cycle of violence that began well before they were born. <br /> <br />'TV Miniseries' is perhaps an unfair title, here, though, because it conjures up images of low-budget high-histrionic situations, invariably starring Joan Collins or that man that used to be in 'Knots Landing'. This is a TV Movie of a very different nature, and I also believe that, since it remains hugely faithful to the novel (aside from some obvious omissions that, even now, you couldn't get past the censors), the TV Movie format with its more generous time restrictions works better here than a cinematic release would have.  <br /> <br />The use of the flashback is a clever and sympathetic way of illustrating most of the childhood portion of the story, and Tommy Lee Wallace coaxes some really excellent performances out of child actors Jonathan Brandis (Bill Denbrough), Brandon Crane (Ben Hanscom) and particularly Emily Perkins as Beverly Marsh (who, fact fans, went on to be very good as Briget in those otherwise awful 'Ginger Snaps' movies). This trend of great performances continues when the adult cast is called into play, with Annette O' Toole, John Ritter and Tim Reid doing some great things with, it must be said, some pretty clunky dialogue. Lee Wallace's direction, too, is polished and fine, and - while there are some portions like the rock fight and the scenes with the adult Henry Bowers and Audra Denborough that feel very much like a TV Miniseries - the whole atmosphere is one of professional polish and excerllence.  <br /> <br />Tim Curry shines as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Sure, he's been typecast in pretty much everything as Camp Baddie since 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', but here, he's wonderful. Truly terrifying and totally immersed in his role, he brings a real sense of malevolence and life to a part that, in the hands of a lesser actor, could very easily have descended into schlock and parody. The opening scenes with Georgie Denborough and the library sequence with adult Richie Tozier still make the hair on my arms stand up today. <br /> <br />The ending is something of a let-down, but it is pretty much a direct lift from the novel, so for that alone, it must be praised. <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent production, and, outside of 'The Shining' and 'Carrie', a strong contender for the best King adaptation ever, 'It' is very deserving of a place in your horror movie collection. It is creepy, it is effective and it's very, very well-done.  <br /> <br />Read the novel first though! <br /> <br />Recommended.
B000AQBAUI|4.0|This is a very solid release if you are looking for the heavier side of early 70's hardrock albums. Yes, it sounds very much like Led Zeppelin, especially the first track, but this album still has so much orginality that it surely can stand on its own. I bought this album after having heard \\"In hearing of\\" by Atomic Rooster on which Peter French does the vocals. He really has a great rock'n'roll voice that fits so well with this kind of raw and bluesy hardrock. Extensive liner notes in the booklet, provides new info on this lost classic. And the icing of the cake, separating this even more from earlier editions is the addition of the last track, from the NEW forthcoming Leaf Hound album. And yes, its a good track, clearly vintage sounding, no need to change a winning forumla. And Pete's voice is in good shape. In my opinion this is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars though, since the songs in the end, can sound a bit meandering and repetitious. Especially some guitarsolos should have been shortened. Some more variety in the \\"in-your-face tracks\\" would have greatly improved this album also. Thus, needless to say probably, I enjoy \\"In hearing of\\" by Atomic Rooster even more than this album.
0679422714|1.0|I give the book an one star because there is no 0 star to select.  I would say this book is 5% facts and 95% fibrication by the author.  It becomes a fashion to trash the late Chinese leader for some Chinese living abroad who have personal agenda or want to make money by meeting the taste of some very few die heart anti-communists Westerners.  Mao made mistakes in his later life but his contribution to China is far far greater than his mistakes.  Mao's legacy in China will live for ever, Only the majority of Chinese people know how great Mao was, not those who just want to distort history to make a buck.
B000068IEU|5.0|When LAST HOUSE first came out, back in 1972, it had people vomiting and fainting in the aisles.  Now, a little over thirty years later, it has people asking why it still warrants our attention, when there are more slasher/splatter movies on a video rental store's shelves than there are cockroaches in a big-city apartment building.  Hey, there's even been a major motion picture with a disemboweling -- HANNIBAL.<br /><br />Actually, there's some possibility that what we're seeing today isn't all of what they saw back in 1972.  Although Wes Craven's introduction on this DVD says this is the most complete version available, there's some footage included as part of the extras that gives us a much more graphic, extended version of the disemboweling scene.  It's unclear from the \\"making of\\" documentary whether this is actually what they saw back in 1972, but even if it isn't, the film still has power for other reasons.<br /><br />Part of this film's continued impact is historical.  LAST HOUSE is the first significant achievement by Wes Craven, who has gone on to become a major figure in both film and television.  It may also be that if it weren't for LAST HOUSE, there would be NO slasher/splatter movies on any video rental store's shelves, because LAST HOUSE was the movie that created the genre.  Film scholars should also note that LAST HOUSE was based on the same 14th-century Swedish folktale as THE VIRGIN SPRING, and contains various allusions to the Bergman film.<br /><br />But it isn't just horror movie historians who believe LAST HOUSE still deserves public and critical attention.  Many people, including yours truly, feel that even though it's no longer cutting edge, it still retains its original impact.  Several good arguments have already been made, which I'll present along with my own.<br /><br />The most widely voiced argument seems to be that while other films have equaled or surpassed LAST HOUSE in the amount and explicitness of their violence, they don't measure up in credibility.  This credibility comes partly from the context in which the violence occurs, and partly from the film's look and feel.<br /><br />Regarding context, any violent act is less disturbing if it either (a) seems totally removed from any life experience you can imagine getting into, and/or (b) happens to someone you can't see as a real person.  Such is the case with so many movies that present contrived situations and victims who are little more than shooting gallery ducks.<br /><br />Such is not the case, however with LAST HOUSE.  The two adolescent girls, Mari and Phyllis, could be people you went to school with, and their humiliation, torture, rape, murder, and mutilation is the end result of a mistake that's easy to imagine making -- letting your guard down because you were having fun and the excitement of the moment made you careless and overconfident.  In this case, Mari and Phyllis are off to a rock concert to celebrate Mari's 16th birthday and want to score some weed.  Unfortunately, they go off with the wrong guy and end up the captives of Krug Stillo, Fred \\"Weasel\\" Podowski, and Sadie -- three escaped convicts who have a very sadistic idea of fun.  (The aforementioned wrong guy is Junior Stillo, Krug's illegitimate son, who is a reluctant participant.)  When the girls try to resist and escape, the sadism degenerates into bestial rage. So much for the notion that if you stand up to the bullies, they'll back down.<br /><br />And here, I'd like to add one of my personal reasons for finding LAST HOUSE effective.  Krug and Co. and the atrocities they committed against Mari and Phyllis seem all to believable to me because they remind me of several characters I had the misfortune to get mixed up with many years ago.  The  details wouldn't be germane to this review, but I think it's germane to say that there are probably many other folks who've been similarly -- if not quite so extremely -- victimized, and so can relate to the events in LAST HOUSE.<br /><br />Moving on to the look and feel issue, while we all appreciate the polished, slick look of a big-budget Hollywood film , that look makes it obvious you're watching a fabrication.  But  LAST HOUSE is a low-budget movie with with that grainy, washed-out low-budget look and slightly muffled low-budget sound.  The filmmakers also deliberately used documentary-style shooting techniques, because their previous work had been largely in the area of documentary films.  All of this combined creates the strong illusion that you're eavesdropping on real events.<br /><br />The second major argument concern the reaction of the killer to what they've done.  Unlike Jason and other mindless killing machines, the killers are themselves shocked and horrified by their own acts, which forces the viewer to find those acts all the more shocking.<br /><br />Finally, I'd like to challenge one basic assumption made by those who claim LAST HOUSE no longer has any power -- that the ubiquity of graphic violence in the cinema must inevitably cause the general public to adopt a \\"So what else is new\\" attitude toward it.  Granted, constant or repeated exposure to a particular stimulus tend to desensitize one to that stimulus.  In fact, some groups of people, such as E.R. doctors, policemen, and social workers, MUST desensitize themselves to heinous and extreme acts of violence to do their jobs properly and stay sane.  But we aren't all in those lines of work, and so don't all have to force or let ourselves ease to feel shock when something shocking happens.  Even if you've seen every other slasher/splatter movie on your video rental store's shelves, you should still be able to get a shock from LAST HOUSE if your emotions are still alive.ts in LAST HOUSE. <br /> <br />Moving on to the look and feel issue, while we all appreciate the polished, slick look of a big-budget Hollywood film , that look makes it obvious you're watching a fabrication.

B0002EXH54|5.0|Usually, less is more. Dave Mustaine says, screw that and let's put as many riffs as we can in Wake up Dead. In this song's case, it works beautifully. Chris Poland is absolutely sweet on this album, and Mustaine is at a highpoint of his career. This album came out in 1986, along with other stellar metal releases like Master of Puppets. Every song on here is sweet, including the cover of I Ain't Superstitious.
0553801503|1.0|SAVE YOUR MONEY. This dead tree is not worth it. <br /> <br />The plot barely moves forward at all, at the expense of hours of your life (formerly mine :).  <br /> <br />Martin must have been counseled \\"more characters means more pages means more money.\\" There can be no artistic reason to have filled us in on the amatory (yes, there is some good semi-hard porn in here), excretory, and ambulatory habits of so many people.  <br /> <br />Martin writes \\"I felt the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters...\\" and yes, that's true. But he didn't. He told the story of half of Westeros for one season, finishing off Autumn.  <br /> <br />We can look forward to Book 5 flowing at this turgid pace--taking Jon Snow and Dany to the same point in time, with the first snows falling. <br /> <br />Meaning that we'll need 4 or 5 books to get us through winter. Ug. Of course, as the starvation and troubles of winter kill off yet more people, the Census will become more complete.  <br /> <br />Someone somewhere will summarize the plot-oriented events in Feast in about a page for you. Save your life, read that. <br /> <br />[BTW, I believe that the people that like this book only do so because they're in denial that they would be so foolish to wait hopefully for 5 years and then spend however much time it takes to read 684 pages of Random Crap.]
B0009A1AS2|2.0|After great albums like Scenes from a Memory, 6DOIT, and Train of Thought, this album blows. Christ, one of these songs is a U2 ripoff. It's bad enough they rip off Pink Floyd in this album with the boring 24 minute title track, but U2? Why in God's name would they ripoff U2? The song in question is called I Walk Beside You, and is just one of the bad songs on this album. The only song worth listening to on here is Panic Attack. The Root of All Evil would seem promising on paper, because it's part of a \\"trilogy\\" with The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul, but the song is weak. Don't waste your money.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Punishing me for buying a legit copy is not acceptable. Wake up. I'd love to get this cd, I read the reviews elsewhere and it sounds like I'd like to own it. But I will not buy a cd that forces me to overcome sophisticated copy-protection in order to personally use it. Can I hear an \\"Amen!\\"? <br /> <br />The Foo boys need to stop their label from doing this nonsense, it alienates me, to use a big but perfectly meaningful word.
B000002JPA|2.0|I love Dream Theater, but this just disappoints me. As someone said before me, this is way too 80s for me. Some highpoints of the album are Take the Time, Pull me Under, and Metropolis Part 1. The rest is basically cheesy filler. I hate Wait for Sleep, I can't stand Surrounded, and there's not much else on the album I can stand.  <br /> <br />For a proper introduction, try something like Train of Thought of you're a metalhead.
B000056N8X|4.0|Highlander, the original film starring Christopher Lambert, was not intended to launch any sequels, and when it did people really wished it hadn't - not one but two terrible sequels are best left ignored. Fortunately the concept was revived in a big way with an excellent television series starring Adrian Paul that lasted several seasons. After the tv series ended they managed to make another film, Highlander IV: Endgame, which starred Adrian Paul and which sort of carried on the tv series while also giving a sendoff to the original film's Christopher Lambert.<br /><br />A problem with Endgame is that Highlander had grown into a refined, dramatic action saga thanks to the television series, but the people funding the film were not aware of that and instead expected some sort of kung fu movie. As such Endgame never felt entirely done... two different recipes were thrown together, but the baking time wasn't the same.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Endgame may be the first respectable sequel to come from this franchise. It offers just enough flavor from the tv series and the original film to partially satisfy everyone, and the more forgiving may appreciate it even more.
B000050XEI|5.0|I love enya, and this CD is no different.  its just great and she has such an amazing voice.
B000301YY8|5.0|I don't listen to that many new artists, because most of it is quite bad nowadays, but when something like this album comes up.....wow, how can you say no to this?!! This guy has an amazing voice and it grabs your heart and doesn't let go for a second. I also think it's fascinating that Blunt is an ex-army guy. Good for him that he decided to make an album - and great for us too! About a month ago was when I first discovered Blunt - they played his video \\"You're Beautiful\\" on one of the music channels here and it really grabbed me. After that I heard \\"Wisemen\\" on the radio and was hooked and had to get the album. There are some very strong songs on it. My favorites are \\"High\\", \\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"Wisemen\\", \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" and \\"Cry\\" - pretty much the whole album! Get this album, you won't regret it.
B000005Z0G|3.0|This cd is so 93' sounding. The beats sound like techno,Oomp Camp(Wuz up ATL!!!) , and reggae mixed. That's not wuz up. Tupac still had a message in his lyrics. He had to rap so fast to keep up with the beat on certain songs he sounds like a long lost Bone member. The album does have some highlights, but not many.
0440234743|4.0|Some people claim this to be Grisham's best. It might be hard to argue against this claim on entertainment value alone- The book is very suspensful and will keep you turning the pages all the way to the end.  <br /> <br />The story is of Nate O'Riley--(twice divorced alcoholic who is in trouble with the IRS)who on a last assignment, must go into the Brazilian wetlands to deliver the Will and Testament of Troy Phelan (A Billionaire) to his illigitimate daughter (Rachel Lane-a missionary living with a native tribe).   <br /> <br />I found Nate O'Riley particularly interesting because of his character flaws, which he must cope with to be successful on his assignment. The journey into the Brazilian wetlands is very exciting, and the book takes on deeper themes as Nate is inspired to consider his religious views after meeting such a pure-hearted person as Rachel.  Also, the exploration of the legal complexities of the case is interesting as is par for Grisham's books. If you are a fan of Grisham, read this book.  It won't dissapoint you.   <br />

B0002EXH5O|1.0|I swore I'd never write another review here on Amazon (for a number of reasons), but given the passing of Nick Menza, this album is a top seller, again.  Why one star for this undisputed classic album?  The 2004 remaster. It is simply cancer, and must be avoided at all costs.  Not a single song goes unscathed; I can't know what Dave was under the influence of, but he *completely destroyed* this &#34;holy&#34; album (easily one of the ten-greatest metal albums of all time).<br /><br />Summary:  DO NOT BUY THE 2004 REMASTER.  Go to E-bay and get a 1990, 1st press, original.  Believe me, when you hear the two, you'll understand why this is of critical importance.
0670033375|3.0|A thoroughly researched work, but one that could have been trimmed by at least 100 pages, if not more. I found myself skimming extensively, attempting to locate the more interesting passages. <br /> <br />In my view, Diamond painted far too rosy a picture in his assessment of American society, neglecting to point out the very real possibility of a huge resource and/or financial collapse in the not too distant future.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Does it really matter if they are a supergroup or not. The CD kicks ass and the instrumentals are amazing. just take a second to listen to acual lyrics and you'll figure out it's not the mindless generic crap you hear in  abour 95% of songs today. either like them or hate them for their music not because they are old. if all musicians just quit after 40 the world would be far worse off.
B00005K3NR|5.0|The 1970's were something of a Golden Age for horror films. In contrast to much of what has passed for horror since then, we got some well written, well acted, and intelligent films. These included The Exorcist, The Omen, Jaws, Alien, and of course Carrie. Film-makers at this time seemed to understand what Horror was supposed to do. Good horror is not about high body counts or non-stop action. It is about provoking in the audience an internal, visceral response of unease and fear. Carrie is a fine example of this kind of film making. It is a modern Gothic tale which has the structure of a Shakespearean Tragedy. It shows suburban high school society as a thin veneer overlying something primitive, tribal, even savage. This is particularly evident in the scene where the other girls attack Carrie in the locker room, pelting her with feminine hygiene products. In one of the Special Feature interviews, Nancy Allen states that filming this scene was one of the most disturbing events of her life. Why? Because during it she felt exhilarated, pumped up on adrenaline, and actually felt hatred for the person being attacked. This interview supports the thesis of the film: there is something primitive in all of us.<br /><br />The film is full of images which have become iconic in horror, Carrie at the Prom, her mother's creepy, masochistic death scene, and of course the conclusion, so often imitated in later, lesser films. Brilliantly directed by Brian DePalma, with wondeful performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie as her deranged mother, Carrie is a must-see for all fans of Horror.
B000063JDE|5.0|As a longtime fan of Lynch's work (notably Twin Peaks), I can easily say this is not only my favorite, but probably Lynch's best and most important. It is an American classic not in the usual sense of the word. It takes the cliched stereotypical setting of small town America and does what other similar films have repeatedly failed to do: iluminate the darkness there that lies within not behind those town's drawn curtains, but also within all of us, our motives laid bare. <br /> <br />This is a dark, upsetting, graphic and disturbing film. The plot is deceptively, simple however. Amidst patrotic images of waving firemen and cheery local lumberjacks, as well as colorful hardware store employees, college student Jeffrey Beaumont returns from college to his hometown of Lumberton, North Carolina (which is every bit as weird in real life as it is portrayed on film, haha, I grew up not too far away) when his father falls ill of stroke. There he discovers a severed human ear in a vacant lot, and with the help of lovely Laura Dern (in an amusingly fifties-type style of dress), tracks that ear to the gloomy Lincoln Street apartment of soul singer Dorothy Vallens. Vallens is being repeatedly sexually abused by her husband and young child's ransomer, Frank Booth, a nitrus oxide addict with a penchant for sudden and unpredictable violence.  <br /> <br />I won't explain the plot further beyond this point, instead I'll leave the films various subplots and subtexts for your approval. The performances themselves in this film are what make the movie. I do not agree with the other reviewer referring to Kyle Maclachlan as wooden. I find him to be a fine actor, perfectly suited to the naive Jeffrey Beaumont, whose innocence in shattered within the frame of this fine film. Laura Dern is pleasantly supportive as Jeffrey's love interest. But it is Rosselinni and Hopper who shine here. The former gives a perfect portrait of how deeply the effects of repeated sexual violence have affected her mental state. Hopper is in his finest, most troubling performance here, truly made for the role of frightening criminal Frank Booth, a nightmare creature made more horrifying by the fact that there are surely numerous men and women out there just like him. Also notable, Dean Stockwell plays a fine supportive role here as the lounge-crooning Ben, friend of our movie's villain.  <br /> <br />The sex is not graphic in this film; however the violence towards the end of the movie is both realistic and unsettling. I can deal with much film gore but there is something about the last 20 minutes or so of this film that haunts me morally. Perhaps Lynch's surreal directing made it all the more disorienting. In any event, this is a fine film, very important to the history of modern American cinema, and deserving of Oscars it never won. :( Five stars all the way, highly recommended. You won't be disappointed. But remember, there's a little Frank Booth in all of us.

1594200696|3.0|The illustrations are interesting and nice.  But this edition is certainly not a \\"user\\".  Page numbers are all \\"inside\\" - along the binding side and at the bottom of the pages.  To accommodate the illustrations you can go six pages without a page number.  When you try to use this book as a reference, the illustrations just get in the way, breaking up your train of thought.<br /><br />Not that I'm pushing book sales, but if you get this illustrated edition (or plan of giving it as a gift), do yourself a favor and also get the paperback version.  That way you have something you can actually use, as well as having a volume for muse.

0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is one of the most unique books I have ever read. Yann Martel has the talent to describe seemingly uninteresting events with exquisite flair. He builds this story up slowly but methodically (unlike many reviewers, I immensely enjoyed the first part of the book also) describing the behavior of animals, and the early life and spiritual inclinations of the protagonist, Piscine Molitor (shortened to Pi) Patel, who practices three religions: Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam with equal reverence. All this has relevance to the story that unfolds. <br /> <br />The second part of the book deals with Pi's unbelievable 227 day ordeal through the pacific trapped in a lifeboat with an adult Bengal tiger. (It is here that Pi's spirituality and knowledge of animals help him survive this traumatic experience.) This part of the book is extremely disturbing, sad, humorous, and bizarre in parts. The ending of the story is equally unusual when Pi tells two different versions of his experiences in the pacific; both completely different yet connected stories, and you are left wondering which one is true.
0553801503|4.0|When I read complaints about what little happened in this book, I have to ask, \\"Did anyone read the last book?\\"  The answer obviously being yes, I wonder how so many well-written reviews by interested parties could miss that the last book effectively ended the war in favor of the Lannisters, with Robb Stark, Joffrey Baratheon and Tywin Lannister permanently taking their leave of the series.  With so much resolved in what had been the primary focus of the first three books, new things had to be developed - Arya's first lessons in Braavos from the otherworldly Faceless Men, Samwell's journey south to become a maester, Brienne's efforts to find Sansa Stark, and two new narrators to introduce the last of the great players of the Kingdom, Dorne. <br /> <br />As far as Cersei goes, she's a great tragic figure in this book.  We learn that Littlefinger's assessment of her ability was correct, and as she pushes away shrewd opinions in favor of sycophants, she leaves herself and the Iron Throne open for a coup from the most surprising quarter - Sir Harys Swift, the man who cried for parley in the first book after Jaime was taken prisoner.  I never would have seen him becoming Hand, much less one who could lay a hand on the woman who engineered Ned Stark's capture and death, but she ends the book naked in a jail cell, facing either a sham trial before the High Septon or a trial by combat requiring one of the Kingsguard to stand for her.  Both options are unpalatable, because one will show her for exactly who she has been, and the other will require her to depend upon the Kingsguard, which she deliberately weakened to maintain control.  As Jaime burns her letter begging him to come home and die for her in battle, a sense of impending upheaval and resignation is created. <br /> <br />It's not as climactic as the preceding book, but now that it's over, other fuses must be lit for the next books to achieve the same effect.  Argue about whether or not paying the hardcover edition'scost was worth it to you, but every word written has advanced the story in some way, however inobvious that may be to us now.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Tim Burton's film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is NOT a remake of the older film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Both movies are based off of the same children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In fact, Tim Burton's film follows the book alot more accurately than the first film.  <br />   I love this movie. The entire cast is great, the costumes and enviorments are amazing and the soundtrack is awesome. I would suggest buying the widescreen version so you can see the entire shots. In the full screen version some of the key characters are completely cut from scenes because the cameras are so close.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's new album is composed of very simple, straight-forward dance elements. All songs seem to target European (especially UK, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy)fans since all tracks are very \\"European.\\" General American audience may not be drawn to her latest music becuase American music has been very pop-rock oriented lately. <br />The title track \\"Hung up\\" is very typical Euro sounded song, and a lot of American people would care less for this song.  <br />This album will work greatly in European and some Asian markets (especially hugely in Japan and HongKong), but not so in the US. <br />Just compare the reviews between amazon.com and amazon.co.uk, and you will understand what I mean...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|For someone who has listened to Madonna for the past 20 years she continues to produce great music.  I challenge any of the \\"current\\" stars of today within any genre of music to be producing work 20 years from now.  She wanted an album of music that you could dance to and that is just what this album delivers.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was not a big fan of Green Day when they first came out. I was biased because I like classic punk like The Clash and others. After hearing this album several times I realized that this is a real classic album.I also have been converted as a Green day fanatic. <br /> <br /> All the songs are strong and relevant. All the bands that copied them are now dust after the release of this classic in the making best album of the year.
B00097DXZS|2.0|If you plan to use this CD on a computer, you should know by now to avoid buying it (and boycott Sony while you're at it).  I made the mistake of buying it as soon as it was released, so I'm out of luck.  If you're a diehard fan of Carlos' classic rock era, then this CD will probably polarize you once again.  If you're from Gen X or Y and like hip hop, R&B, or pop, and you liked his previous two CD's, then there's a good chance you'll be happy with this one. After three similar CD's in a row, fans can't help but argue whether he has evolved and is reinventing himself or he sold out for a commercial formula.  Only you can decide for yourself. Carlos at least injects some of his fiery licks & phrasing into each song.  Many of them would be fairly bland and mediocre if he didn't.  You certainly see more of his smoldering intensity on the tracks without the guest artists.  I still feel Carlos is one of the most exciting guitarists of all time, and if he still feels the need to bring in a guest artist, I would be thrilled if he teamed up with Henry Garza (of Los Lonely Boys) and put out an instrumental album of guitar-fueled fury.  Perhaps Sony & the producer discouraged him from going back to his roots because they feel that audience has died out.  No, we're still here...hoping & waiting...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When you thought that it was game over for Madonna. She makes an amazing comeback with a fresh sounding, excellent and vital album.  Too bad radio programmers are focused on playing nothing but overplayed bland R&B and Hiphop. \\"Confessions\\" singles are badly needed to infuse new life to a very zombiefying sameness on the radio. I used to like Mariah but she has hit a creative wall - her new effort sounds botoxed.  <br /> <br />This new Madonna album sounds brand new and crisp with new beats and has a solid foundation from echoes of 70's dancefloor fillers. It's like a mash up of the past and the future. <br />The singles flow like honey. Sweet and thick. In a perfect world all the singles from this album should be radio smash hits.  <br /> <br />In a perfect world this would be album of the year. We need this album badly.
B0007WF1WI|3.0|Ok, I got this dual disc about a week ago and I find it sortof ok! The dvd audio 5.1 is much better sound quality so, I would advice you to get that but for a collectors item like myself then its well worth it. The menus are pretty hip and stylish which is a good postive thing. You get 2 music videos on the dual disc. Which is good to look back over but the greatest hits dvd/cd is out so all the hits are on it. <br /> <br />Buy it if you can't find the dvd-audio or buy it if you want/need it as a collectors item but don't buy it if you just want a dual disc ;)!
0380778556|5.0|I couldn't wait to read it after it was recommended to me. I am so disappointed that a thoughtless, selfish person gave away the whole suspense aspect of the book.  Why should she be allowed to ruin other people's experience in reading it for the first time?  Someone needs to remove her comment.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I must make a confession: I absolutely LOVE this amazing new album and so will you! You have not heard or sampled anything like it before. Madonna dazzles all under her disco ball. The comparisons between Madonna and other artists are moot. She is beyond legendary and has nothing else to prove. Mariah may be the comeback queen of the moment but she is solely R&B and her cultural significance is overshadowed by Madonna's contribution to music history. Anyone who defies this fact needs a higher education or a lesson in pop culture enlightenment. \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is quite simply a brilliant kaleidescope of pure pop confection and Madonna's best since \\"Music.\\" It's a disco inferno filled with infectious dance hooks and throbbing beats that will make everyone (even dancephobics) jump up off their feet and get into the groove like never before. The first three tracks -- \\"Hung Up\\"; \\"Come Together\\"; \\"Sorry\\" -- are instant classics but there's much more. My other favorite tracks are \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"Push\\" which have hit singles written all over them. Gwen Stefani said it best: Who hasn't been influenced by Madonna?!?! In her latest endeavor, her best is above the rest. Who's that Girl? Does anyone need to ask?! Madonna is once again perched at the top of her most creative and inventive powers and has the prowess to influence a new generation while keeping her faithful fan base content and anticipating her next incarnation.
B000002H4C|4.0|Just like Danno said, it's what FM rock radio used to sound like.    It was the summer of 1981 and rock music was about to come to an end.  Disco was more or less dead and MTV was not yet on the air.  By 1983, music would be dominated by the horrible likes of Michael Jackson and Culture Club!    When the movie HEAVY METAL was released in living animation (this was the rage before the Japanese introduced us to Anime in 1988), it came with a kick-ass soundtrack with bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick and Sammy Hagar.  Back in 1981, acts like this could still fill an entire stadium on their own.  And while all the music is not exactly \\"heavy metal\\", their are some other great tunes by Donald Fagen, Don Felder, Stevie Nicks and Journey (yes, \\"Open Arms\\" was a brand new song on this soundtrack before the \\"Escape\\" album was released at the end of the year.    The only flaw, in my opinion, is that the songs are not in the order in which they come in the movie, the way most soundtracks run.  It's fun to follow the duration of a film in your head as you listen to the music.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Like Gena Rowlands in this country (who ironically did a similar film, 1996's \\"Unhook the Stars\\"), Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro is a masterful actress who inhabits her characters wholly with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of personal depth. In this beautifully filmed 1998 film directed by Walter Salles, she offers a superbly realistic portrayal of an aging, embittered spinster named Dora, who earns money by writing letters for illiterate passers-by at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station. At the outset, she is a petty thief who takes the letters and decides with her friend Irene which ones to post if at all. Her dull world changes when Josu&eacute;, the nine year-old son of a woman for whom Dora has written a letter, suddenly becomes orphaned when the woman is killed by a speeding bus. The letter was to be sent to Josu&eacute;'s father to reunite the family. Now his plight gradually becomes Dora's concern, and over the course of the film, her destiny.<br /><br />What Salles does with great dexterity is show the gradual closeness between Dora and Josu&eacute; without resorting to any obvious sentimental plot devices, as neither is particularly sympathetic at the beginning and use their surly, obstinate personalities as protective shells. Even though this story has an overly familiar structure, Salles and screenwriters João Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein bring a heavy dose of neo-realism within the unfamiliar, non-tourist locales used. It's all reminiscent of Vittorio de Sica's and Roberto Rosellini's classic post-WWII work in Italy like \\"The Bicycle Thief\\" and \\"Open City\\". With his later film, 2004's wonderful \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\" and now slated to film Jack Keroauc's seminal \\"On the Road\\", Salles is obviously becoming known as a master of the road movie, and it is easy to see why with this work. Helping considerably is the stunning cinematography of Walter Carvalho, who presents vividly inhabited tableaux with each new phase of the journey from the bustle of inner-city Rio to the open roads to the religious pilgrimage to the new shoebox-style settlement.<br /><br />But it is Montenegro who dominates the proceedings as she gradually develops a character who earns our sympathy economically and honestly as she makes every moment count. For example, as she senses herself becoming attracted to Cesar, the religious truck driver, she applies a stranger's lipstick with a quivering hesitation that is almost as heartbreaking as the realization she faces moments later that he has left for good. A real shoeshine boy picked by Salles, Vin&iacute;cius de Oliveira plays Josu&eacute; with equal economy and responds to Dora's actions with realism that alternates between touching and frustrating. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Mar&iacute;lia Pêra amusingly ebullient as Irene and Othon Bastos compellingly conflicted as Cesar. The climax comes a bit out of left field with the introduction of new characters that provide some amount of closure to Josu&eacute;'s fate and wrap up many of the open plot threads, but the somewhat pat turn does not undermine the genuine strength of the film.<br /><br />The DVD provides a nice extra with Montenegro, Salles, and producer Arthur Cohn contributing invaluable audio commentary in English. Salles and Cohn talk about the sources of inspiration for the movie as well as the more technical aspects including the rigors of location shooting with masses of amateur actors and a minimum of art direction and constructed sets. Montenegro speaks less, but like her performance, makes all her comments resonate. It's interesting how variations of the film's basic plot have come up in recent years - for instance, Jan Sver&aacute;k's 1996 \\"Kolya\\" from the Czech Republic and Takeshi Kitano's 2000 \\"Kikujiro\\" from Japan - and this one certainly holds up well as a prototype.oads to the religious pilgrimage to the new shoebox-style settlement.

0345475674|5.0|Out of all of Harris' books, this one is my favorite... Harris has a wonderful ability to describe things in a way that lets your imagination build a mouth-watering picture of every situation. Not only does he describe the aquaduct, the bay, the moutain and the towns with incredible detail, he also describes every single (minor and major) event the same way. Mind you, he does not take several pages to do either! <br /> <br />This book is also not only a fun read, but it will provide an ignorant person, like me, with a basic understanding of the Roman Aquaduct system, specifically the Aquaduct Augusta, and Volcanos. And what is really great is that he does not bog you down with information or statistics, he gives you just enough so that you have a BASIC understanding which can later be researched with a non-fiction book.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|You could hardly go wrong with this compilation if you are a true Eurythmics fan. I remember very well seeing them in concert in 1987 when they opened their show pulling down a gigantic zipper on the curtain to perform the powerful \\"Sexcrime\\" from the \\"1984\\" soundtrack (which is sadly not included here). Annie Lennox has one of the genuinely great voices in rock, and coupled with Dave Stewart's synthesizer-heavy arrangements and effects-laden production, it soars with supple, soulful power. As Eurthymics, their sound was inescapable during the 1980's, and they are forever marked by the cool asexuality of their early hits - \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\", \\"Who's That Girl?\\" and \\"Here Comes the Rain Again\\".<br /><br />For me, however, Eurythmics peaked around 1985-87 when they became particularly inspired by Detroit-based soul and R&B. High points include the Memphis-style horns blaring through Lennox's scream-and-shout vocals on the vindictive \\"Would I Lie to You?\\"; the percolating roll of \\"It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back); the double-barrel shotgun duet with Aretha Franklin on the feminist anthem, \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\"; the harmonica-swinging purgatory, the vituperative monotone vocal and insistent drum beat of the double-entendre \\"Missionary Man\\" (that Frankenstein laboratory video is still memorable); and the savagely sexy \\"I Need a Man\\" with defiantly lacerating vocals by a honey-dolled Lennox sounding like a searing combination of Nina Simone and Joan Jett. Other gems include the pulsating 1960's-influenced \\"Thorn in My Side\\" complete with a wailing saxophone, the pop-soul of \\"You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart\\" and the entrancing ballad \\"The Miracle of Love\\".<br /><br />There is a mellowing that came after a twelve-year break with the calming \\"I Saved the World Today\\" and the back-to-basics \\"17 Again\\" that has a gentle nod to \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and a particularly lovely vocal, both songs from their 1999 \\"Peace\\" album. The newly recorded songs match up well to their predecessors with the only noticeable change the lived-in throatiness of Lennox's voice sounding more emotionally resonant than ever - the teasing opener \\"I've Got a Life\\" with the Barry White-sounding disco-swing arrangement and the Al Green-like \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\" with lush Bee Gees-type harmonies. This is a wonderful compilation though a bit frustrating for the omissions, for example, any track from 1989's wondrous \\"We Two Are One\\", and truthfully, the programming of songs on a greatest-hits package eliminates the thematic aspects of the albums and tends to trivialize the output as a whole. Regardless, this is essential listening for any fan.their predecessors with the only noticeable change the lived-in throatiness of Lennox's voice sounding more emotionally resonant than ever - the teasing opener \\"I've Got a Life\\" with the Barry White-sounding disco-swing arrangement and the Al Green-like \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\" with lush Bee Gees-type harmonies.

0515127485|5.0|This is a great historical 'what if' type of book. Not only is Harris a great author who's writing flows very quickly and fluently, but he also has a very talented mind for these kinds of books.<br /><br />The first half of the book may seem somewhat slow and uneventful and I remember being somewhat frustrated on my first day of reading. However, about half way through things start to take a very interesting twist, which is followed by a twist, etc. Things keep taking unexpected and exciting turns throughout right through to the last page and that is something that defines (in my eyes) a thriller.<br /><br />One critisizm that I will throw out there is that there doesnt seem to be much of a climax with the book. Whenever you think you're there you expect for things to slow down but they never do. After reading all of Harris' book in the course of two weeks it got rather annoying, but it definately does not take away a star.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Just bought it and had my first listen to it. FANTASTIC is all I can say. Starting from Hung Up all the way to Like It Or Not, this is a non-stop dance album that's sure to fire up the dancefloor. Imagine if you take the best bits of Madonna (her first album), Erotica, Ray Of Light, True Blue and Like A Prayer, and put them altogether in a futuristic retro dance album, well, that's the best way to describe Confessions On A Dancefloor. <br /> <br />Essential listens include Sorry, Hung Up, Jump and Get Together.
0553804367|4.0|When I say that this is a good book, i dont mean that it is a very exciting or easy to follow book. I mean that it is a book that serves its purpose by presenting a brief history of time to the reader. Certain chapters, however, are very interesting (at least, to me they are) but other chapters are very dry and require you to pay attention or else you will get lost and find yourself robotically skimming the lines.  <br /> <br />I recently graduated high school, so my education in chemistry and physics is rather limited and I found myself struggling to understand a few of the concepts. Yet I did manage to learn quite a lot from this book and in a few years I will probably read it again and learn even more. So it's probably worth the investment, and worth reading, but dont expect it to be a big page turner.
1401300901|2.0|The book looks promising from its description. The premise is: Dead husband leaves love letters to wife from the beyond in hopes to help her grieve. However, while reading it, I didn't find myself sympathetic with the main character, Holly, even though she'd lost her husband.  <br /> <br />Holly is undescriptive. We know more about her siblings and friends than we ever do about her. All we know is that Holly was married to Gerry (her late husband) and now she pines for him. Every other line in this book reads \\"Holly's life revolved around Gerry\\", or \\"Now life meant nothing to Holly\\". It really makes the book boring! The only moments of entertainment are when she is surrounded by her friends: the stereotypical party girl who finds her soulmate and the wife who's expecting a baby. Of course, Holly feels no joy for her friends because \\"she'll never have Gerry again\\". The whole book reads like this. <br /> <br />We're given no reason to feel sympathetic towards Holly other than the fact that she is a young widow. Apparently, before Gerry died, all she did was sit at home all day, pining for him while he was at work. She refused to learn anything domestic, and just lays in bed all day. (Not to impune on grieving widows-just to say, this is all she does and it's really boring!) <br /> <br />This is an ok book if you're not someone who reads alot, and by that I mean, you probably won't care that the books drags on and on and on over the grief of Holly, the boring widow. For those expecting a literary masterpiece, this isn't it. Ms. Ahern gave it a good try, but unfortunately, the dullness of her main character kills her effort.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Ok this cd has been released 3 times. 3 times!!!!! Is Mariah in need of that much attention? She was sweet girl next door now she's tryn to go gangsta or something, recruiting Snoop and nelly, add a lame ass dvd, a few extras, and all of a sudden she it's a new cd. I thought I bought this cd once, and even then I thought it was bad. I was suckered into buying this crap again? At least I have Madonna's new cd. I adviseyou skip this release. Buy Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor instead.
0783228007|3.0|Scenes are missing on this DVD by Universal. Besides Kidd's and Helen's personal scene that's not apparent, what about the missing dinner scene at Helen's cabin?  Duvall and Stroud reveal their characters even more at the dinner table but it is not shown on this version. Duvall invites a reluctant Helen to the table and takes command for himself. This film gets no respect by not being complete.
B000B8QF00|3.0|I appreaciate the music of Alanis.  I've followed her career from the beginning, including the bubblegum-pop era in the early 90's.  But, with 19 songs, I think the selection should reflect the ecclectic range of talent that Alanis possesses.  The five tracks included from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" were obvious inclusions.  The failure to include the best track from \\"Junkie,\\" Unsent, is a little hard to grasp.  Additionally, only 2 tracks were included from the \\"Under Rug Swept\\" album, by far the most diverse and comprehensive album of Alanis' career.  Precious Illusions and Flinch are essentials to this compilation.  I enjoy the fact that the collection includes the hits from movie soundtracks, but if that was the intent of this release, it should have been a 2-disc set with these tracks included on the second CD.  This would have allowed for more room to include more of the music that makes Alanis influential and inspiring.  She's come a long way from the angst-driven girl of the 90's.  It's upsetting that commercialization has buried her talent in a \\"status-quo\\" collection of songs.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Hype from hipsters steered me away, the indie-press descants shuddered my shoulders - as well as the God-Is-Love voodoo of his persona and not to mention the seeming state-by-state gimmick - it was difficult not to savor the eccentricity of it all...the sheer eclecticism of subject, the mellifluence he employs so briskly, the outrageous-by-design titles, the peculiar chord progression and song structure, the deft wordplay, the gorgeous melodies - you find new and wondrous things half a dozen times in.  Poet laureate or troubadour, I don't know [and neither does he], but I want to run with him in the garden and find out.  But first I need to stop in Chicago and visit my sister.  Religiosity is scarce, and while that's a good thing here, he is so beautiful in his inherent glory that he could take me to church and marry me.  If it were legal.  My grade:  A
B0007GAERG|1.0|I wish I could give the album less than a star, I mean YUCK, all the songs sounds the same, all I can hear is \\"Mooo Mooo\\" she's mooing like a cow, are you even serious about reading the reviews of her? (she even call herself MIMI now like she's 8 years old), what the hell is she thinking? does she still believe that she can beat  Madonna? I DON'T THINK SO.. Hey Mariah, Kill yourself, maybe you'll be popular this way.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have waited months and months and months for this CD, as I do for all her music. As soon as I heard that it was going to be a continuous dance CD with NO ballads I was ecstatic!  I was a bit tired of the acoustic/techno sound that dominated her last 2 CD's (Music and American Life).<br /><br />This CD lives up to everything I had hoped for and more! Madonna has ALWAYS been the LEADER not the follower has always been the TRENDSETTER.....This CD (like all her others) is very evident of that. This is pure dance music with lyrics that have more than just the superficial meanings that most dance music that fill the clubs have. Catchy hooks, great beats, great verses....all with a unique sound that only Madonna can pull off!<br /><br />HUNG UP is just awesome! SO infectious! Great sample in it with lyrics that will have you singing it all day, everyday!  10/10<br /><br />GET TOGETHER is a good dance/trance song with good lyrics and great sounds going on in the background.  9/10<br /><br />SORRY is one of my favorites on the CD. SO catchy and sure to be a SMASH in the clubs and has a very radio-friendly sound to it. LOVE IT!!!!  10/10<br /><br />FUTURE LOVERS is another great dance/techno song that has a lot going on it that is just crying out to be danced to! Love all that is going on in this song....get's you really pumped up!  10/10<br /><br />I LOVE NEW YORK is a great fusion of dance/rock. I must say the lyrics are a bit cheesy and too \\"fly by night\\" - this one may have to grow on me over time. Not a favorite on the CD.  6/10<br /><br />LET IT WILL BE is a great song!!!  People are saying in their reviews that it is a CD/floorfiller...I have to disagree. I think it is fun and is up to par with the rest of the songs on here.  9/10<br /><br />FORBIDDEN LOVE is the slowest song on this CD. NOT a ballad but, a slow dance song. Not too fond of it......Does not seem to fit in right at this spot in the CD. Other then where it falls on the CD it is not a horrible song.....maybe should have been at the end??  7/10<br /><br />JUMP has VERY infectious lyrics! You see a song title like \\"Jump\\" and you think it is going to be just loud and club bumpin' but this one is more tame than I expected. But, I guess I judged the book by its cover or in this case the song by its title. LOL  GREAT SONG!  10/10<br /><br />HOW HIGH is amazing!!!  LOVE IT!  Talking about her fame and if it matters and how hard she tried just to see her name up in lights. Great beats and great synths.  10/10<br /><br />ISAAC is different. I don't know how else to word that. I like the male chanting in it - that is catchy, along with the beat. Might have to be another that grows on me with time.  8/10<br /><br />PUSH is my absolute favorite on this CD!!  I don't even know what to classify it as. It's not dance. It's pop/R&B??  Whatever it is it is GREAT!!!  I love the beat and her vocals. The meaning is great as well. The melody in which she sings sample the Tom Tom Club - GREAT SONG!!!  10/10<br /><br />LIKE IT OR NOT is a cool way to close the CD. Lay all your songs out there and then simple say \\"like it or not\\" THE END!  I like it.  9/10<br /><br />Madonna is always on top of her game and never seems to age. I have been an avid since I bought her first RECORD  LOL!  This CD really reminds me of early Madonna. I have loved Madonna through the years and through all of her changes. Like I said she has always been the LEADER and the TRENDSETTER!  She has paved the way for everyone!!! Paved the way for the \\"club mix\\"!

B000B8QF14|5.0|Well, I have seen Green Day live 6 times and they never get old. Seeing the DVD of them perform live again makes me want to see them live again. They are so energetic and they keep the audience involved. I personally love this DVD/CD, although I think they should have included a few more tracks on the cd the DVD makes up for that. It has some documentary and behind the scenes stuff and I really enjoy it.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|This is one of those Sony CD's that contains \\"XCP\\" spyware.  XCP was written with the intent of concealing its presence and operation from the owner of the computer, and once installed, elements of the software run continuously -- even when no Sony-BMG music CD is in use. It provides no clear uninstallation option.  <br /> <br />Additionally, without notifying users, the software appears to contact a remote machine under your control.  <br /> <br />Sony has shocked and angered people over this issue. Software that deceives the owner of the computer it runs upon and opens that computer up to attacks by third parties may be expected to come from malicious cyber-attacks; it is certainly not expected nor acceptable to be distributed and sold to paying customers by a major music company.  <br /> <br />Sony should temporarily halt manufacturing CDs with XCP and reexamine \\"all aspects\\" of their \\"content protection initiative.\\"  <br /> <br />If Sony truly intends to undo the harm that they have caused, they should immediately and publicly commit to the following measures:  <br /> <br />1) Sony should recall all CDs that contain the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology. It must include removing all infected CDs from store shelves as well as halting all online sales of the affected merchandise.  <br /> <br />A recent New York Times article said that well over 2 million infected CDs with the XCP technology are in the marketplace and have yet to be sold.  <br /> <br />2) Sony should remove from all current and future marketing materials statements like that on [...] that say the cloaking software \\"is not malicious and does not compromise security.\\"  <br /> <br />3) Sony should widely publicize the potential security and other risks associated with the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology to allow the 2.1 million consumers who have already purchased the CDs to make informed decisions regarding their use of those CDs. The publicity campaign should include, at a minimum, issuing apublic statement describing the risks and listing every Sony CD, DVD or other product that contains XCP or SunnComm MediaMax. The publicity campaign should be advertised in a manner reasonably calculated to reach all consumers who have purchased the products, in all markets where the CDs have been sold.  <br /> <br />4) Sony should cooperate fully with any interested manufacturer of anti-virus, anti-spyware, or similar computer security tools to facilitate the identification and complete removal of XCP and SunnComm MediaMax from the computers of those infected. In particular, Sony should publicly waive any claims it may have for investigation or removal of these tools under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and any similar laws.  <br /> <br />5) Sony should offer to refund the purchase price of infected CDs or, at the consumer's election, provide a replacement CD that does not contain the XCP or SunnComm technology. For those consumers who choose to retain infected CDs, develop and make widely available a software update that will allow consumers to easily uninstall the technology without losing the ability to play the CD on their computers.  <br /> <br />In addition, consumers should not be required to reveal any personally identifying information to Sony in order to access the update, as Sony is currently requiring.  <br /> <br />6) Sony should compensate consumers for any damage to their computers caused by the infected products, including the time, effort, and expenditure required to remedy the damage or verify that their computer systems or networks were or were not altered or damaged by XCP or SunnComm MediaMax products.  <br /> <br />I'm not buying any more Sony CD's until they do the above! <br />
1559409002|2.0|Carnival of Souls (Herk Harvey, 1962)<br /><br />Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls is your classic cult-hit B movie; it's terrible, but that it's terrible is half the fun of watching it.<br /><br />The story concerns Mary Henry (stage actress Candace Hilligoss), who is the only survivor of a car full of women who lose control and veer off a bridge during a drag race. Wanting to get away from the scene of the accident and start a new life, she moves to, of all places, Utah to take a job as a church organist. She finds herself, however, plagued with hallucinations, fainting spells, and other such things that make her realize something is very wrong, while finding herself drawn to a long-abandoned carnival on the outskirts of town.<br /><br />In order to really get at the entertainment value of this flick, you have to overlook a lot of things-- most notably, the painfully cheesy overacting. Hilligoss wanders through the film looking like a prototype of Nico (of The Velvet Underground and... fame), while her would-be suitor Sidney Berger (now director of the Houston Shakespeare Festival, so you have to figure the guy's got chops) hops around like a gerbil on benzedrine; Roger Ebert, in his original review, called Berger's character \\"the definitive study of a nerd in lust.\\" The other main thing you have to overlook is the terrible special effects, but one figures the movie was made with a bargain-basement budget. That it manages to evoke anything other than laughs is testament to some real talent lurking beneath all the silliness. **
B000002MFE|5.0|I have read a lot of positive comments about Eric Clapton Unplugged and I enjoyed every one. Good blues all around. Favorie cut:Layla. This is the type of song to listen to a hot humid weekend afternoon with ceiling fans rotating and bottle of wine by your side. AWESOME! Go out and buy it!
0375422889|4.0|Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return (Pantheon, 2004)<br /><br />Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis took the world by storm a few years ago, first in its native French, then in English. Of course, since the graphic autobiography (\\"graphic\\" in terms of \\"graphic novel,\\" not as in 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed) stops when Satrapi is fourteen, you know there has to be more.<br /><br />Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return takes us through Satrapi's adolescence-- her years in Europe, then, as the title promises, a return to Iran during her eighteenth year after a cascade of nasty events (some her fault, some not) that leave her homeless and ill.<br /><br />Where Persepolis is good, its sequel plays on the first book's strengths while more successfully integrating the overarching issues of the never-ending wars in which Iran finds itself. When Satrapi discusses the regime's reasons for using the veils in the book's most important panels, it doesn't seem intrusive at all, despite stopping the action (briefly) and having no use other than imparting sociopolitical values. It's a very rare thing when that works.<br /><br />Persepolis is good stuff; Persepolis 2 is even better. *** ½
B000BO0LLS|5.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is by far the best album released this year (to me, anyway).  It marks a tremendous comeback for Miss. Carey (she went from being the laughingstock of the music industry to having the song that spent the most weeks at #1 in this decade, so far at least).  Every song bubbles with excellent production and terrific vocals.  Highlights include the monster hit single, \\"We Belong Together\\" (which y'all have heard a million times on the radio so I don't think I need to describe it), the smooth sexy Kanye-produced \\"Stay The Night\\", which features her greatest vocal performance in years, the slick Snoop Dogg collabo \\"Say Somethin\\", the old school 70's throwback \\"Circles\\", the classy piano ballad \\"I Wish You Knew\\", and the final track, the gospel rouser \\"Fly Like A Bird\\".  The album is by no means perfect (the should've-been-wonderful Nelly collabo \\"To The Floor\\" is surprisingly dull) but on the whole it is a superb disc and unquestionably the best thing Carey's released this millenium.  This re-release comes with four new songs including the big hit \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", the Twista collabo \\"So Lonely\\" and the remix of \\"We Belong Together\\" feautring Jadakiss and Styles P.  It also includes a bonus DVD with four videos and an interview with Miss. Carey. The re-release is a great buy for anyone who missed out on the original edition and also a great stocking-stuffer for a young person just getting into Mariah Carey. <br />Side Note: Shoppers, please ignore the one-star reviews for this item.  The majority of them are written by Madonna and Jennifer Lopez fanatics who have not even heard the album but want to bring Carey down because her success somehow interferes with their respective happiness.  It literally makes me sick to the stomach when I think about all that this woman has been through in the past five years and how there are still cold-hearted people trying to bring her down.  Please do not let these ignorant reviews change your opinion about purchasing the album.
1573223026|1.0|I paid good money for this book so  I've been  trying  hard to finish it these last  couple of  weeks. Hornby  hasn't made it  easy  though.  Lacking any of the charm found in his first book High Fidelity, this  ponderous piece of garbage may well be one of the first books I have flung out the window in a long, long time.  Such a shame too...High Fidelity, About A Boy...fine little reads..Too bad his last  two efforts have been such stinkers, this one in particular. One star  only  because I know the  guy can write.  You would never know it , however, if this was the first book of his you had bought.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to first admit that I am a long time Madonna fan and typically enjoy her CDs.  This album has met all my expectations and more.  Many listeners will enjoy the fact that the songs flow seamlessly into each other (remember when you used to put on a record and just let it play!).  No skipping is needed with this album.  All the songs have at least one catchy hook that will keep your attention and make you want to dance.  As with most pop songs, the lyrics are pretty basic, but you will be able to (and want to) sing along after a few spins.  The standout tracks on this album are Jump, Get Together, Sorry, Push and Hung Up.  Each song is unique enough to sound fresh and new, but they also summon you back to the 70s and 80s.  Future Lovers, I Love NY, How High and Let It Will Be will also be big in dance clubs. The rest of the tracks take some getting used to, but support the overall theme of the album - dance music with a purpose.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is absolutely the best Madonna album. It is her quintessential piece of artwork. While Mariah is around flapping her fat behind on MTV, Madonna continues to actually have a brain. Madonna's work is deeper and more inspiring than even. No one can compare.
B000025H0Q|2.0|I am a huge fan of Nick Drake but this is my least favorite of his albums and I have rarely listened to it since getting it ten years ago. In fact, I'm glad this wasn't the first disc of his that I purchased or I probably wouldn't have bought any of his other albums. This album is way too overproduced. The best example is \\"At The Chime of a City Clock\\" which starts out strong but is overwhelmed by the riffing saxaphone after each line sung by Nick Drake from the second verse on. The first time I heard \\"Hazey Jane II\\" I couldn't believe it was Nick Drake it was so downright cheesy and dated. The instrumentals on this disc border on easy listening also, which ain't my style. The only songs worth hearing are \\"Northern Sky\\" (one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard) and \\"Fly\\", although I prefer the home version he recorded at Tanworth in Arden in 1969 to the studio version. It's interesting that John Cale was a guest on this album, but the results overall were subpar compared to the rest of Nick Drake's recorded work. I don't think it's a coincidence that Nick Drake's follow up to \\"Bryter Layter\\" was the extremely sparse \\"Pink Moon\\" album. I think it was a direct reaction to the overproduction that weakened his songs on \\"Bryter Layter\\". \\"Pink Moon\\" benefits from the setting of just Nick Drake and his guitar, while the songs here are marred and dated by the arrangements. I don't understand why anyone would rate this as Nick Drake's best work. While I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Nick Drake's music to anyone, I wouldn't recommend starting here. Try \\"Five Leaves Left\\" or \\"Pink Moon\\" first.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|So Lonely is the hottest song on the album hands down, and Don't Forget About Us is a beautiful ballad.mariah you have done it again..This is going to be a huge stocking stuffer!!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Like (most) every other gay on the planet I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the new Madge album. I admit I got a copy of it a few weeks ago from a friend but I also had already pre-ordered it.......so it's not quite that illegal, right? Anyways, the album has been utter ear-candy for me with each song catchier than the next. It's just the remedy to liven myself up within these increasingly dark times and a great reminder that we all need to have a bit of joy in our lives. Each song is like a cocaine fueled evening of laughter...... I highly recommend it.  <br /> <br /> <br />So many people hated her last album but, personally, I think it's her best. 'American Life' moved me in many ways and helped me get through a hard time in my life. Too many complained that it sounded like noise to their ears but didn't stop to really hear the actual song medleys. The music was stunning and the words....nothing like what she has written before. Beyond personal. The album further cemented my love of her ever-evolving character. <br /> <br /> <br />I am one grateful soul to the one we call M-A-D-O-N-N-A. She's been around since I was a young lad and I still remember the first time her name was uttered to me. I remember the day that my sister, my neighbor, and I all gathered 'round the record player to groove to her songs. Time and time again she has blown me away with her visuals (let's not get into her concerts either..........other than to say WOW). Time and time again she has blown me away with her staying power. <br /> <br /> <br />There is, sad to say, no one else like her. I'm surprised how many try to emulate her but come nowhere near what she has to offer.....and the bitch is 47!!!! I've been on other blogs that trash her and then read on these same blogs praise for the likes of Jessica Simpleton, Avril Whatever-her-name-is, Britney No-talent, etc. What do they have to offer other than their same-old, same-old brand of watered down blond bimbo? Madonna will be rememberedlong after she is gone from this world.....the word 'icon' comes to mind actually. I pity today's kid culture....who do they have to aspire to? I, Myself, feel damn lucky to have grown up with Madonna <br /> <br /> <br />I mean, c'mon, this woman had a cultural impact on the world. Nobody else, ever, has gone into the territory she has in such a public way. Don't get me wrong.....others have toyed with certain themes but she balls-out embraces/promotes such ideas as: Self-expression, tolerance, change, spirituality, sexuality, WOMAN-power, so on and so on. She's taken on politics and religion.....two distorted belief systems that play a big hand in our day to day lives. Yet people try and knock her down. I don't get it. Why aren't they knocking back the people who really deserve it?  <br /> <br />Sooooo to make a very long post short......support her ass....buy her album..... listen to it as often as you please....... be happy....... enjoy life........ and let's ALL start to turn the tide of bigotry that is sweeping our Nation/ World!!!!
B00008PW2D|1.0|Sort of like the old joke quoted by Woody Allen, such an awful season, and so little of it!  Can't believe they have the nerve to charge full price.  And just as bad breaking up Season 6.  I have the first four, but that's where I get off.  If we let them rip us off, they'll just continue to do it.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Generally, I hate comedy films as a genre, and I'm extremely hard to please when it comes to the genre. I find that most comedies insult my intelligence. I don't find things funny easily at all, but I was so glad I gave \\"Elf\\" a chance, because it was completely hilarious and one of the very few (in my opinion) comedies worth owning. It's not something I'd want to watch on the off-season, but it has become a new Christmas Eve tradition in our house to watch, and everyone loves it, kids and grownups alike.
0385338686|2.0|When you settle in with a Sophie Kinsella book, you need to pack away your cynic's hat. Because these books can be a fantastic indulgence, but not if you turn each page with an eye out for the faults.<br /><br />In The Undomestic Goddess, the main character is a tough, successful London attorney. Everything in her life is exaggerated in typical Kinsella style: Her family blows off her birthday, she can't picture a vacuum cleaner bag, she works All The Time.<br /><br />Then, she apparently makes a major mistake. When she realizes its ramifications, she freaks out and flees blindly to the countryside. Then, in typically whacky Kinsella style, she becomes a housekeeper to a nouveau-riche couple.<br /><br />Of course, she learns to do the job well, sneakily handles some legal work for her boss, falls in love, relaxes, becomes more beautiful, and exposes some major corruption back in London.<br /><br />Even if you like this syrupy and silly kind of story, there are some major issues with the premise. Why is it that working women are so often portrayed as colorless, unhappy and unfulfilled? The message that giving up your career for a country life of bread-baking, that just seems to be an old-fashioned, even anti-woman message. I don't want to spoil the fun of the book, but that's a pretty major problem.<br /><br />I also thought Kinsella missed a chance to tie up a lot of loose ends. Even if she'd added a \\"Six Months Later\\" final chapter, she could have told us what happened to her nouveau riche couple's legal tangles, if the lady of the house found a fulfilling volunteer opporunity, and many other tidbits.<br /><br />Kinsella is a delightful writer. Her characters are loopy and self-effacing, if over-the-top. If you can get past the silliness, and the troubling anti-working-woman premise of the plot, this is a funny, joyful read. In fact, I'd say it's one of her best books ever.
