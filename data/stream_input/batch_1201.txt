B0033H7VI6|5.0|It arrived sharp,strong,pointed and work ready.This knife should anger some of the more expensive brands because it exposes their over pricing of their products.This knife is made of 1095 steel,plenty strong enough for most needs I can think of except for just cutting open steel doors like some kind of Jedi\\"c'mon it's a knife and does knife jobs,I don't expect someone to build an entire log cabin with just a knife like some of these la la land guys that live in a fantasy world;we as humans make saw's,router's,ax's etc. because long ago we realized that big knife not make such a good tool for everything.The fact is the handle is meaty and comfortable and doesn't allow your hand to slip like metal,wood or plastic.It's handle is not as durable as a  Micarta but is more shock absorbent and that sells it for me right there.1/4 in.thick steel of 1095 quality with a Teflon coating that appears to hold up pretty well.$40.00vs.SOG,Cold steel,or Ontario's $80-$100.00 dollar of equal quality.Those other brands make extraodinary knives for a fee but this is a price comparative.
B0018LMZO4|1.0|I wish more reviews were centered around the quality (or lack thereof) of the individual offerings/recordings. Enough of the esoterics - I know what I like and why, and I hate to spend good money for bad(terrible). So don't get impatient, as I did, and download the MP3 offered for TOAD. If the MBs had sounded like THIS in '67- I wouldn't be writing this today and I'd be $10 richer.  I could have mixed better in a 55 gallon drum. My 40 year old memory is less muddled than this...
0439023483|3.0|Seriously, what were the editors thinking letting this book go out as is?  It's just sad that a book that so many kids are going to read is so poorly edited and rife with grammatical mistakes.  People don't \\"lay\\" down, they \\"lie\\" down.  I mean, that's not that hard to catch.  There were dozens of other annoying, easily fixable mistakes like this all throughout of the book.    What is the world of publishing coming to?  How are we going to convince kids that grammar is worth learning if the published works by their favorite authors are full of mistakes?  It's just really sad.    Apart from the grammatical mistakes, the book was pretty good.  The story is interesting and engages you from the first page.  However, Collins doesn't describe things much at all, and this does hurt the book.  You'd think that she'd describe Katniss' reaction to learning she was going to the games.    Is she scared?  Fearful of dying? Going to miss her family?  We don't know because Collins doesn't tell us.  I had a lot of questions about the country and the town where Katniss lived.  How is it set up?  How many people live there that she didn't really know Peeta?  How large is the town that tributes can be summoned yearly?  Who knows?  Collins never says and thus, misses out making her story fuller.    Still, the book is definitely a good read, for kids or adults.
B001CWOCV8|5.0|I've had my blu-ray for a while now and it works fine on both my Panasonic blu-ray players.  The only thing is that there is a long introduction/prologue/buildup that one can not fast forward on.  You have to wait (and watch it) until it finishes and then one may access the menu.    Basically, the concert is one big lovefest.  Lionel Ritchie loves Paris. He loves France.  He loves the French audience.  His fans love him.  They love his singing.  We all love him too.        This concert is long, with songs from the Commodores to his duet with Diana Ross to his solo career.  Here's the set list.  Just For You  I Call It Love   Penny Lover  Easy  Ballerina Girl  Running With The Night  Still  Oh No  Stuck On You  Dancing On The Ceiling  Three Times A Lady  All Around The World  Sela  Endless Love  Sail On  Fancy Dancer  Lady (You Bring Me Up)  Brick House  Hello  Don't Stop/Angel/Destiny Medley  Say You, Say Me  All Night Long  The concert is quite enjoyable and fun.  Sometimes, it's one big party, a sing along, a solo song with Mr. Ritchie on the piano, or there may be songs with the band members.  Mr. Ritchie really energizes and entertains, pleasing the Parisian crowd (and me).  He sings as good as he ever did, and he looks almost the same as he ever looked in his career, with a strong youthful vigor.  Did you watch the TV show, \\"Who Do You Think You Are?,\\" where he traces his roots to the 19th century?  Mr. Ritchie looks pretty much the same as he does on the TV show.    Picture is fine on high def 1080 and sound is fine through the TV speakers.

B000TGCR38|5.0|This is an amazingly fast paced war film set during Nazi-occupied Netherlands.<br />There are many twists and turns, horrors and bloodshed, Dutch pain and perverted Nazi pleasure, greed and betrayals, mocking laughter and weeping,  defeat and disaster, and death and destruction.  There are murders and lives saved, drunkeness and soberness, betrayals and trust, cruelty and compassion, war and peace, things hidden and things revealed, and defeat and liberation.  It's the tale of a Jewish lady, the Dutch Resistance, the Dutch people, their Jewish neighbors, the German Nazis, the Allies, and of war-torn Holland.<br /><br />There's a watercraft which is supposed to save lives, but it ends up in the killing of lives.<br />There's a coffin which saves a life, and a coffin which ends a life.<br />There's a man whose profession is to preserve lives, but he takes lives.<br />There's a Jewish lady whose singing career is ended by the Nazis, but she ends up singing for and to the Nazis.<br />There's a Nazi who preserves a life, and a Dutchman who betrays a life.<br />There's a redhead who sleeps with the Nazis, and then she joins the Liberation. .<br />There's a defeat for the Dutch Resistance and a triumph for the Allies.<br /><br />There's the war in Holland and the sounds of war in Israel.<br /><br />I recall three nude scenes, along with related scenes and quite a lot of war violence and torture.<br /><br />So this film is not for the faint of heart or for the whole family to watch.  The film is well done and acted, providing a glimpse into the shady and gray struggles between men and their fellow men.  More importantly, there is a clear distinction between the darkness and the light, between what is immoral and what is moral, and between what is evil and what is good.  If you can get past the violence and killings, and other scenes, it actually is quite fascinating to watch.
6303109950|4.0|I wanted a copy of the movie Tombstone with Kurt Russell. Found it on Amazon, ordered it and I am very satisfied with this product.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Especially good for umbrella strollers. I bought it for my mclauren quest sport model. Also elastic.. Very useful. I reccomend for all kind of umbrella strollers..
B002JCSWV6|4.0|I was not aware of this historical event and was very happy to enjoy the performances of two of my favorite actors (Freeman and Damon)in this. The movie, purchased from Amazon.com, was exciting and held my interest for the entire length of the movie.
1451629184|3.0|A well written account of a horrible HORRIBLE situation for a little girl, but with all the media exposure there isn't much in the book that hasn't already been told, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have been following the story on the news.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This is the best spoof ever, and it stands on its own very well as a comedic sci-fi (similar to Red Dwarf in many ways).  And so many of Guy's statements were priceless, like \\"Have you guys ever seen the show?\\" when they were about to do something stupid with the miners.  Great for the Trekker and non-Trekker alike!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I purchased the dockStubz adapter so that I could charge my iPod Nano (6th gen) while also using an accessory, such as the Griffin Navigate remote control. As advertised, the dockStubz adapter allows a straight pass through between the male and female 30 pin dock connectors. I was able to use the Navigate remote both with and without power coming in to the mini-USB connector on the side of the dockStubz adapter.<br /><br />I was also quite pleased to discover that the mini-USB connector on the side of the dockStubz adapter also allows you to sync your iPod with your computer. I didn't see this feature advertised anywhere, but it is certainly a welcome addition. This could help some people reduce the number of cables that they have to carry.<br /><br />The 30 pin connectors on my dockStubz are quite tight- to the point of being difficult to connect to my iPod Nano. On the plus side, I know that the connector won't just slip out on its own. I would imagine that the connector will loosen up a little over time, hopefully to a snug, but not too tight fit. The tight fit might be by design, so that iPods and iPhones that are docked have enough support so that they won't fall over.<br /><br />I only gave 3 stars for look and feel because there is a somewhat rough seam on the plastic from the molding. The plastic itself seems to be of good quality, and I'm certainly not worried about it ever breaking (without major abuse anyway). The look and feel isn't bad by any stretch, it's just not extraordinary either.<br /><br />5 stars overall- I was looking for function, and this product delivered even more than I expected. I would strongly recommend this accessory to others.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|While I rejoiced when the Star Wars: The Complete Saga was announced for Blu-ray, I have held off on placing a pre-order.  While George Lucas has every right to change the Star Wars movies before the Blu-ray release, I guess that means \\"complete\\" applies to himself on how he views the Star Wars movies.  When I see \\"complete\\" for a movie release, I would assume that a theatrical release of the Star Wars movies would be included and not any additional tweaks that Lucas has done since then.    Are any of the tweaks, like replacing the Muppet of Yoda with a CGI version, needed to make Yoda look credible for this HD release?  If Lucas wants to tweak the Star Wars movies, because he feels something could be improved, then I would prefer that the original and tweaked versions are included.
B002ZG98G4|1.0|I ordered the Blue-ray version of the movie Morning Glory and was very disappointed with this experience. When I put it in the Blue-ray player it would begin to play up to the Columbia Pictures introduction and just go blank.     Assuming it was a one in a million defective Blue-ray I returned it and ordered a second time. Unfortunately, the same outcome ocurred with the second copy    I returned the second copy and requested a third only to discover the identical problem. I play many other Blue-ray films on my player so I know it's not the player. I have two Blue-ray players in my home and tried both of them.    Needless to say, I returned the third one and now just gave up. I don't want to try a fourth.     On another note, this is the first time something like this has happended. All of my other orders have been fine.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|Don't waste your money. Not appropriate for children and definitely did not keep my little one's interest at all. It will be in our garage sale in a few days!
0307454541|5.0|As with other reviewers, I found the start to be slow but the end to be riveting. I started the book 3 times before I got hooked, somewhere around page 40 or so. I especially liked how while one story line ended, another continued so the book didn't end suddenly, as many do.  I also enjoyed the complexity - the mix of business crime, journalism, cyber crime, societal and social issues, mental health, violence against women and the flavor of day to day life in Sweden. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the characters to be very likeable in spite of their quirks and values which differed from mine, and I cheered them on. I've read all three books in this series and will miss these characters.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Here's the deal. If you try to compare it to the classic '70s stuff, you'll drive yourself crazy and short the lads for giving it a respectable try. After all, they could just resign themselves to playing the classics on the summer shed tours from here on out.    The real question is not how it compares to \\"Fragile,\\" but how does it stack up to \\"The Ladder\\" or \\"Magnification\\"? Or anything since the studio tracks on \\"Keys to Ascension?\\" Maybe it's just the novelty of having something new from them, but it's sure a fun listen (light years better than the two atrocious reunion albums from the Asia half of this extended family). Ask me again in a few years whether it gets dusted off any more than \\"Open Your Eyes.\\" I tend to think it will be.    While their chops are still unchallenged in their geezer years, the problems seem to come with getting their act together in the studio to put out something new. Great players in search of something to play. Horn and Downes at least stepped up to organize the thing, even if you have to laugh about how thin it is: The 30-year-old Buggles outtakes, the Squire song apparently from his solo projects, the acoustic guitar track that can pad the running time any ol' day because it's always nice to hear.    Howe's \\"Bumpy Ride\\" instrumental not only sounds sounds tacked on and points out how few of the song credits have those multiple slash marks that indicate collaboration instead of a component assembly. Maybe that's why the last song, with six (!) slash marks, echoes the old days and holds the most hope for the future; that this may be a good start on something still better to come.
B005ILYW1E|5.0|So, as the description says, Blitz is about a pair of English cops tracking down a serial cop killer. Jason Statham plays a bad ass with a propensity towards violence while Considine plays a gay cop who also has some past anger issues. They are paired up to track down the cop killer, who is flaunting his \\"bad behavior\\", but is smart enough to stay one step ahead of the police.<br />Statham's character in particular was spot on. Some of the ways he handles things, whether through direct stomping or fairly direct threats that you know he will follow through with, he has a way of getting things done, and reminds me of several people i know in real life.<br />The movie itself is fast paced, and deals with several social topics, from drug abuse and alcohol dependency to anger management to gay rights, and many moral issues along the way. For a short, fast paced, action type film really has quite a bit going on.<br />I would highly recommend watching this one.<br />Note: If you arent from England, it may take a few minutes to get used to the dialect, as is always the case when you are used to American English. Not a big deal at all, and you get used to it quickly enough.
B000I0RNVG|5.0|Enough said. This was the best deal on amazon, and I got more quality material for it. My favorite movie!
0307455378|5.0|Another great book by Carlos. It keeps you hooked until you finish the book, with a very clever and unpredictable finish.    Highly recommended for anyone that likes novels or previous books from him.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|In terms of Dolby Digital headsets for the xbox 360, you will not find anything that beats these (yet). I get why they are so popular and beloved by those who use them, but you really need to be a hard core gamer to require the use of surround sound while you play. If you are recreational, don't bother.     Be prepared to change batteries often on these. There have been a number of times my audio has cut out in the middle of a game, making it almost impossible to play effectively. There is no warning as to when the batteries will die, they just go dark all of a sudden. Huge Oversight by the company and very frustrating at times.
B004U7LJWC|2.0|If you had any expectations that this album would be more signature Derek Trucks material...you're out of luck. There are a few sparks of great slide guitar work but the material lacks that special punch of earlier songs. Now a combination of an eleven piece band, I'm reminded that more is NOT always better.
0071762345|5.0|Let me preface, I'm Kind of lazy person when it comes to writing, I'm always moving onto the next thing.  I enjoyed and derived so much value from this book; it could not resist writing this review.      Social Media right has now been Noisy and Cluttered.   Dave Kerpen presents all that is \\"Social Media\\" that would be common sense in years to follow.    As a Business Owner or Leader of an organization Small, Medium or Fortune 500, it is easy to be concerned  a) How do I get social media right?  b) What is the cost of not getting the strategy and execution right?  c) Where do I start?  Well this book puts a lot of the above concerns to rest.    He presents a very simple, uncluttered approach to getting Social media and Word of Mouth marketing started.  He presents realistic advice and best practices.  His book is full of real case-studies and action items for your company (Profit or Non-Profits) or Individuals alike.    Do yourself a favor, Buy this book and save tens of thousands if not Hundreds of thousands of consulting dollars you would otherwise spend. I did and it is Likeable :).     Full Disclosure: I Know Dave through the Entrepreneur's Organization.

B003L77TZI|4.0|This CD is just fun music with catchy beats... I would assume if you are a fan of pop music you would enjoy most of the tracks on this CD.  Everyone has different likes and dislikes when it comes to music so, I will do my best to convey to you what my favorite and least favorite Katy Perry tracks are so you can decide if this is a worthy purchase to make.  From her previous album \\"One of the Boys\\" I liked all the songs, EXCEPT: Mannequin.  On \\"Teenage Dream\\" The songs I dislike are as follows, \\"Firework\\" and\\" Who am I Living For\\".... \\"Pearl\\"- actually not sexual... has a positive message kind of grew on me. also I don't like the remixes found on the CD either, but I generally never like remixes of otherwise good songs.  Yes, the music is sexual.... but just because the songs have sexually suggestive lyrics doesn't make someone go out and be promiscuous, that comes from lack of communication or lack of a responsible role  model in ones life. Take this CD for what it s a fun catchy pop to dance or sing along to not the kind of lyrics you take seriously enough to live your life by..... With the exception of the track \\"Pearl\\"- it does have a positive message.
B0058A119G|3.0|I have at least 20 of Barbra's early LPs.  A few 8-tracks, a few cassettes, no CDs.  I LOVED Barbra's earlier style, verve, vocals.  Anyone remember Down with Love?  I did not purchase this CD; I went to Youtube and listened to all the tracks uploaded from this CD.  This CD is totally soothing; however, too much sameness.  That may be a function of the writings of the Bergmans.    Whatever, I was disappointed.  Sounded like she cherry picked songs within her range that her vocals could still handle.    I cherish her earlier work; she was the gold standard and will always be remembered as the once number one female vocalist of all time.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Love the cd!  I play it over and over.  Awesome work by Maroon 5!  Think that it is the best cd that they have recorded!    I highly recommend it!!!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Fun, addicting and well made! With so many mediocre apps for android I am exited to find a game of this high quality. I've recommended this game to friends and colleagues and I look forward to seeing more releases from the developer. Great work.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Honestly, when I rented the movie Insidious from my local Redbox, I thought, \\"Here we go again: another crappy horror movie.\\"  I expected nothing but the very worst, but still, I felt compelled to rent a movie, and I had seen everything else.<br /><br />I am quite pleased I had the opportunity to see this because, to be honest, it scared the hell out of me.  This is the kind of movie that tricks you into thinking it is a rote horror-fest, then treats you to surprise after surprise, building suspenseful moment upon suspenseful moment to its ultimate climax.  It is a movie of the supernatural, but it is more in the spirit of atmospheric movies like Rosemary's Baby than Poltergeist.  It's not that you think this is something that  might happen to you, but the atmosphere is so haunting that if you are anything like me, you will be turning on all the lights and peering around each corner after watching this film.  I haven't been this affected by a horror movie since The Shining, and I hope I don't have to wait another thirty years to be this scared again.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|Do not even make the effort.  This book was selected by my book club - not a single positive comment was made in reference to this book - which can not be defined as a NOVEL.  It is not even a collection of short stories barely linked because it includes what the writer wants to pass off as a chapter with charts fill in with incoherent babble.  A total failure - I can not believe that it made it to be a National Best seller.  Perhaps it is the interesting title and cover?  Then, people were too ashamed to admit they wasted money?
0316098337|5.0|This is a very intense narrative. The voice of the narrator is unique--a child whose experiences are limited, but whose creative response to what could be overwhelming stress winds up empowering her young son in ways that eventually enable him to aid their escape. The post-room second half of the book is, in some ways, more fascinating than the first half. While aspects of the book recall the old LAW AND ORDER \\"ripped from the headlines\\" approach to plot construction, this is a story whose characters become convincing on their own terms in the end.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I love nature so much and this CD is just a beautiful addition to my collection.   I recommend the version narrated by David instead of the Oprah one.  Get it, show it to your children (if you have any)  It is important for them to start appreciating nature early on.
B000002AVF|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moQYR2L2TCE3CQ]]
B003Y5H4YI|5.0|I saw an advance screening of The Debt tonight. I'll admit, it was a film I kept my eye on once I read about it on the IMDb message boards for Avatar some time ago, since Avatar was another film with Sam Worthngton. I remember it looking pretty interesting, however I'd not heard about it for some time after due to the delays. However during July, it had gotten advertised more, and I was ready to mark down August 31st as a \\"must see\\" date. However when I got a pass in an Alliance Films giveaway, I was excited.<br /><br />And thankfully this movie did not disappoint. The movie comes out next week, I'd say go see it.<br /><br />A remake of the 2007 Israeli flick of the same name, which I'll admit to having not seen, The Debt follows two of three secret agents who went on a mission to capture the surgeon of Birkneau, and bring him to Israel to expose him for the crimes he committed against Jewish humanity during WWII. His horrifying experiments have left thousands dead in brutal and gory ways. The gang had a plan set in place, and according to a new book written about the ordeal, the mission was completed. However, something about the mission has come back to haunt them... And futhermore, that very some 30 years later, thing has the two remaining agents fearing for what happens next in life!<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, because believe me, the nervousness and suspense I felt throughout the movie is unmatched by any other film I saw this year. Believe me, this film is insanely well written. Matthew Vaughn of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class fame wrote the script, and boy you can tell he did. His charm and genius are all over the film, in a different fashion than the two mentioned films, but his clever writing style is there. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the turn of events is clever. There's loads of suspense throughout the film. Seriously, not one scene had me feeling calm at all. The film was  high octane, ferociously suspenseful thrill ride that had me on the edge of my seat from the first frame.<br /><br />The film also has a great ability to surprise people, and believe me, this movie is filled to the brim with surprise and intrigue. The film's central twist is especially shocking. Believe me, the movie definitely toys with your expectations and perception of events in pretty much every way possible. But the central twist is especially a shocker, as it completely comes out of nowhere and strikes you blindly. At the screening, you could feel everyone tense up, and especially as the film reaches its shattering climax, the suspense just got more unbearable. However, there is some good Vaughn style humour thrown in there for good measure too.<br /><br />The films' performances are fantastic. Helen Mirren shines as per usual as Rachel, and her young counterpart is not only very pretty but amazingly talented too. Jesper Christensen is amazingly scary as the villain, Vogel, and he does so without any gimmicks. But the real surprise is Sam Worthington as David. Believe me, he really, truly shines here. His portrayal is very convincing, and he manages to prove to the audience that he is not just a pretty face. As well as the film's direction is slick and sharp. madden has a fantastic eye for a shot, and it shows, there are a lot of moments of visual brilliance too, and some shots even look spooky at times.<br /><br />In short, The Debt is the biggest surprise of the year, and a true shiner in a dark age for cinema nowadays. If you would like to watch a movie that for once isn't 3D, for once doesn't force feed you with gimmicks, don't pass up this full tilt action thrill ride. Although I saw it for free at a screening, I would have felt like my money was put to good use if I paid to see it too. Do not miss this film!<br /><br />OVERALL: 10/10<br /><br />Pros: The Debt is an action packed, unbearably suspenseful film that is remarkably well written, stylishly shot and ferociously thrilling, a film not to be missed.<br/><br />Cons: None I can think of...
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I am well satisfied with this product. It works as well as cables costing $30. I highly recommend it and have bought 2 of them for my 2 HD TV's.
B004ULNJF8|3.0|Jason Statham is one busy dude!!  As many movies this guy is spitting out within the year, quality is bound to take a ride on the backseat!!!  With this said, BLITZ is borderline straight to DVD quality. The only factors saving it is the random action and its main cast of Jason Statham, Paddy Considine and Aidan Gillen.  All three give strong performances which hold your attention throughout the movie.  What hinders the movie overall is the \\"been there, done that\\" plot of loose cannon cop with total opposite partner and the pointless and useless side story of characters we really don't care about but somehow get tied up to the main story.<br />If you've seen the original DIRTY HARRY, you probably will be disappointed by this film because it simply can't compare.  If your a Statham fan, by all means watch the film and see him do what he does best, but for the rest of you this movie is at least worth a rental.
B004YF6MHW|5.0|I have used Camera ZOOM FX as my default app for months. It's a powerful camera app loaded with a lot of extras. Version 3.x really cleaned up the interface nicely and added some additional configuration options. Zooming has always worked on my LG Optimus V. The developer was quick to respond when I had an upgrade issue. It loses 1/2 a star for requiring ping.fm to upload photos to Facebook, etc. It's easy enough to share photos directly from the Gallery app, but this workaround shouldn't be necessary.
0877180121|1.0|I am a parent who does not have much musical background or education. My daughter, age 10, learns piano and this book is prescribed for her. I find that it is very hard to do the exercises in the book because they need the parent/teacher to play along an \\"accompaniment\\" --- which is fine if the parent already has that ability! If, like myself, the parent is a musical novice, then no accompaniment is possible, and the exercises become deadly boring, and it is hard for the child to see the motivation or even have fun at all.<br /><br />Now I was hoping this book came with a play-along CD, and there are symbols through out the book alluding to an accompanying CD. But mine didn't come with a CD. No help on the web either --- no accompaniments to this book available on any web-site I could find.<br /><br />So if you are a parent or a teacher with good musical talent then by all means follow the five-star reviews. If you are in my boat --- a musical novice whose child is learning music --- then I would suggest the Suzuki book on piano.
B000002GYW|5.0|While HOTEL CALIFORNIA is generally considered the Eagles best album, DESPERADO might really deserve that accolade.  Released in 1973, the Eagles second album was a risky venture---a concept album with the old West as its setting and a youthful outlaw as its protagonist.  The four original members--Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner--share vocals admirably.  DESPERADO has a raw, sparse feel.  It's direct and uncluttered, primal in its instrumentation.<br />And the songs are some of the groups finest.  DOOLIN-DALTON sets the stage beautifully, a stunning marriage of lyric and melody.  TWENTY ONE celebrates the advent of manhood with its strong bluegrass influence. That innocent joy mutates to sheer self-indulgence in OUT OF CONTROL, a raucuous rocker that lives up to its title.  The morning after blues is poetically addressed in TEQUILA SUNRISE, one of the two hit singles from the album.  And what can one say about DESPERADO that hasn't been said?  One of rock's most beloved ballads, the song flawlessly paints an epic ode to lost hopes and dreams, its urgent plea to \\"let somebody love you\\" forever haunting.  Next is the cynically wise CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL.  A quick reprise of DOOLIN DALTON segues into the driving OUTLAW MAN, my favorite track.  It epitomizes the outlaw's commitment to his chosen life and foreshadows his ultimate fate.  SATURDAY NIGHT is a beautiful piece, its simplicity both touching and tragic.  BITTER CREEK is a somber prelude to the inevitable showdown.  The album concludes with the DOOLIN-DALTON/DESPERADO reprise, a remarkable reworking of the lyrics, its counter-vocals bringing a rousing finale to the story.<br />DESPERADO is a notable album for both the Eagles and country-rock.  Few albums have fused country and rock so effectively.  It has stood the test of time; whether it's better than HOTEL CALIFORNIA is ultimately up to the listener.
B0051GOB26|5.0|This review is both for the movie in general and the limited edition Blu-Ray set.  This is such a great cult classic!  Words can't even describe how much I crack up at this movie!  I upgraded to Blu-Ray a while back, and so of course when this limited edition Blu-Ray came out, I was all over it!  There is an awesome collectable booklet within, and several cool features.  Probably my favorite of them is the Mark It Dude feature, which tallies up all of the dudes, Lebowski-isms, and F-bombs throught the movie, (and there are quite a few F-bombs, but the use of most of them are pretty funny).  All in all, a great film.  If you have never seen this movie and can tollerate the language, I highly recommend checking this out if you haven't already seen it!  \\"The Dude abides!\\"

0061537969|5.0|Narrated by Enzo, a philosophically inclined lab-shepherd-poodle mix (though he'd be the first to tell you he's actually probably part-terrier), The Art of Racing in the Rain is the stirring story of how Enzo's owner, Denny, struggles to keep his family and life together in the face of loss and despair. The inventive narrative style skillfully weaves plot developments with Enzo's rhapsodic meditations on competitive racing and his own purpose in life. As might be expected in a novel narrated by a faithful dog, Enzo does not dwell for long on any of Denny's faults. However, his devotion to Denny is never sentimental, and the tender, trusting relationship between master and dog is genuinely moving. This is a life-affirming testament to the individual's resiliency and ability to triumph over incredible hardship.

1451629184|5.0|I would have to say the anxiety I felt after reading this book must certainly be a far cry from what Jaycee felt during her captivity.  Even so, I can't get it out of my mind and the mental pictures her book invoked in me do not leave.  I admire Jaycee for her endurance, perseverance and most of all, for her ability to overcome and adjust to freedom once again after such a long and terrible ordeal.  Jaycee's ability to write so vividly, honestly, even bluntly about what happened to her is nothing short of amazing considering her lack of education and the emotional, mental and physical stress she experienced.  It must have been quite painful to bring it to the forefront in her mind, think about it all again much less write it down to share with the world.  Hopefully the experience of writing the book had a healing quality to it as well.  I do hope Jaycee can recover her faith, finding new meaning and purpose in her life and the lives of her daughters.

B004A1Y4UM|5.0|These guys are seriously addictive and you won't regret buying ALL of their albums. There isn't a single song that I don't like...love them all. I'm going to my 3rd Volbeat show this year and if they are anywhere near you, it's a must-see concert. They are the best live band,(besides Metallica of course..)that I have seen...and that's 100's by the way. Their tickets are super reasonable and in the states, they play small venues.     Buy this album immediately but beware...you won't be able to stop listening to them!!

B0058OUJA4|5.0|They came at dusk. From my fortification, I could make out their torches illuminating the hexplates beneath them as they approached. Death glowing in their eyes.<br /><br />I felt secure enough, I had built a wall of plasma canons to the West and a field of shockwaves to the East. The only path available to them traversed a canyon I constructed of hardier plasma canons and mobility nets strategically placed at every turn. And at the end of my path of destruction: a laser turret poised to clear a path through their unsuspecting ranks.<br /><br />They would need ten strikes with an army ten fold what was necessary to breach my keep. I grinned devilishly.<br /><br />But then the cold touch of previous defeat that lurks in the recesses of the battle-hardened mind reminded me of recent falls from grace. I had thought myself safely fortified before and suffered terrible loss. I had grown weary of defending towers in the same age-old fashion and I had lost my fervor. This was my last stand.<br /><br />And this was different. Never before had I been able to build my own defense net so freely and guide my enemies into my trap. Never before had I such a diverse and powerful arsenal at my command. Never before had I the ability to capture the moment of victory and dispense it to strike fear in the hearts of enemies to come and earn respect from my allies.<br /><br />I was shaken alert by my forward plasma canons erupting suddenly and shattering the encroaching foe with an earth-shuddering roar. It seemed too easy... and before the thought of victory had fully formed in my mind a second battalion had reached my canyon. They were quicker than the first poor souls, but despite gaining a couple hexplates they, too, fell.<br /><br />\\"To the victor, the spoils!\\" I declared, as we raided their fallen to fortify my canons. On the horizon, however, the night sky lit up as dozens more flowed from that cursed dimensional portal. It would prove to be a long battle and my resilience truly tested.<br /><br />Wave after wave, they charged. Some stronger, some quicker, all falling. They had ventured as far as my laser turret, to the foot of my keep, but I held fast! I held strong!<br /><br />And when the last of my foes disintegrated, my canons were silent once more. The unending darkness returned to the blessed night but only for a moment as the fireworks of celebration ignited!<br /><br />I immediately sent Tim the screenshot and exclaimed, \\"Again! This time on Medium!\\".tronger, some quicker, all falling. They had ventured as far as my laser turret, to the foot of my keep, but I held fast! I held strong!

B002VWNID6|1.0|I love this movie and always have. I was just trying to replace my vhs version with a dvd. The disc states that the movie is on one side and the extras are on the other. That's normal, however, upon wathcing the movie I found that 1/2 the movie and the extras are on side one and the second ahlf is on side two. I have to flip the dvd over part way through the movie. I'm not particularly happy... I hope it's a mistake on the manufacturer's part.
0763644765|5.0|I am not really potty but put my 11 month old son on potty when he wakes up and when he is pooping. He loves this book and won't get off the potty till I've read it to him. It's really cute. More pics than word so I just added some of my own words in several places.
1933952806|5.0|Darrell Young is, in my view, the most objective camera equipment review writer in the business. I've owned Nikon digital SLR cameras since the D100, and have purchased his reviews for all of them. They have, invariably, been more informative and helpful than the competing camera guides. Save your money and buy only Digital Darrell's guides. I don't even look at the other guides anymore; Darrell writes the best camera guides - bar none!
0439796636|5.0|Having seen the wonderful theatrical production I just had to read the original source material.  The book adds so much to the story that it is well worth getting it.  Enjoyed it very much.
0895260131|5.0|This is a must read book. It is a well researched and written documentary on the realities and history of Islam. It does correct many impressions hoisted upon us by an idiot MSM and leftist apologists.
B0053B347M|4.0|This is a simple product at a reasonable price.  It is a strip of small LED lights that plug into a USB port.  In my case, it plugs into the USB port of my monitor, so it turns on when the monitor has power.   (My Samsung turns off the USB when it goes to sleep.)      It creates a soft glow behind the monitor that reduces the contrast around the screen.  It actually makes it possible for me to work longer with less fatigue.    I consider it to be a small investment for a very large value.
0439023521|4.0|This was a horrific, brutal, not fit for children or adults book.  Unfortunately, once I started I could not put it down.  I will probably be horrified by the two sequels.  I read it because my preteen granddaughter was trying to explain it to me, and I was sure I could not be understanding her correctly.  Surely no parent with good sense would let a child read this.  Sigh!
B004K4AUZW|3.0|Is a production that I found it boring, do not feel that energy from the previous album you like from beginning to end, I feel that the issues are very similar
1401324517|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting Rafa's autobiography and pre-ordered it months ago, it was well worth the wait. I really enjoyed it and I read it in one weekend as I couldn't put it down, it's a real page turner!<br /><br />It gives a real insight into what makes Rafa tick, it's very honest, inspiring and really interesting; I've been a fan of Rafa's for 6 years and I admire him even more after reading this book.<br /><br />The book is really well written and each chapter has 2 sections, the 1st written by Rafa and the 2nd by John Carlin with more info and insights. I especially like the way he describes Rafa as \\"Clark Kent and Superman\\" and reveals that Rafa has fears and insecurites (as most of us do & can relate to) but the way he conquers them and has achieved all he has is a real inspiration. I also love the inclusion of Rafa's family giving more inights about his personality.<br /><br />There are 16 pages of colour photos in it ranging from when Rafa was a child to his US Open win last year.<br /><br />A great book, Rafa fans will love it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This was the first Sonic i got and i was absolutely thrilled to get it. i love playing with it at work and i usually carry this one in my pocket wherever i go. Only thing i have to complain about really is the nubs for the UV ink and the pen. i got sick of losing mine so i just glued the pen one in with superglue. Otherwise this is still one of my favorite collectibles.
0767817486|5.0|This is based upon a real life story!It's been featured on National Geographic's show called=Locked up Abroad!<br /><br />  In the 70's while boarding an international flight out of Istanbul Airport.A young american named BILLY HAYES is caught attempting to smuggle 2 kilos of hashish out of the country.The drugs were strapped to his body.<br />Uh-Oh things didn't work out like he planned.While his girlfriend that was with him managed to get on the plane.He got nailed & the story will have you glued from there on.<br /> He is taken into custody to the powers to be.They laugh & belittle him while stripping him naked{nice tush shot}*For the female fans.<br /><br /> He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who actually sold him the hash.He didnt sell out!<br />  Billy tries to makes a run for it & is recaptured.He is initially sentenced to serve just over 4 years for possession.With no time for the more harsh crime of smuggling drugs.<br /><br /> The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense.The prison warden is one mean sadistic animal & he dishes out the worse physical torture as well as mental abuse.<br /> The other inmates that had been there for a while were zombies from the torture they had been exposed to.You will be surprised @ one of the americans he makes friends with who is still known in hollywood today.<br />  I saw this movie when it came out on the big screen.I had a huge crush on BRAD DAVIS who sadly died from something close of the content of this movies plot.He did fabulous job & he also starred in SYBIL.It starred Sally Field with JO Anne Woodward.<br /><br />  This was a gripping story of the real deal{THEN}if you get into trouble transporting drugs overseas.The turkish prison had hellish conditions that unto itself would make any one crazy.<br />I won't spoil the story line{u have to see it for your self}billy i order to survive had too dig deep into the pit of human strength to grab every oz of fight it took to survive the hot mess he got into.There is a breaking point that had producers in limbo & they walked off set.Billy lost it a few times but that time was a bit vivid be prepared.{BLOODY}<br />  The movie was based upon BILLY HAYES real life experience who was featured in the highlights in the main menu on the dvd i have & i recently saw his story on Nat/Geo's show called locked up abroad~His account was pretty much close to the same but hollywood amped it up a bit.<br /><br /> Ive never forgotten this movie!#1 I adored Brad Davis his death was ironic in lue of the subject matter of this film years later.A shame because he had looks & talent.When i watch this movie now i think how sad that he lived a part in this movie that was ultimately his demise in his real life & death.<br /><br /> It's a poignant look into the world of drug smuggling on an individual level no cartels or glamorized drug rings.He was young it was the 70's sad to say \\"everybody was doing it\\" here or there.He jus had the foolish guts to do it & it was something he paid for 10 fold.<br /><br />You are not an American w/freedom if you make those types of choices in a country less than the diplomacy we have in U.S.A.<br /> The sadistic prison warden i think was harder on him because he was strong fought back & was american.Unlike the native captives under his rule who seemed use to his abuse.<br /> It was a matter of making an example out of him power trip per say Billy wasnt the only one that got the henoius physical abuse.From the distain the prison warden who i felt like had hatred any way but focused alot more on americans.The famliy notion in the film as touching as his father tried.<br /><br />It made me think because these things have & do happen to our fellow americans like P.O.W's,Radicals that kidnapp people for political reasons for ransom/& drug smuggling that still happens today.<br /><br /> A stunning performance by Brad Davis & his determination along with the struggle within was as good as it gets.He had to fight or fall down & live in the hell he put upon himself!It has a well deserved ending & he lived to tell his story & this movie was about his experience.<br />WATCH IT YOU WILL ENJOY IT...Its one i rewatch from time to time!self!It has a well deserved ending & he lived to tell his story & this movie was about his experience.  WATCH IT YOU WILL ENJOY IT...Its one i rewatch from time to time!
030745455X|5.0|Stieg Larsson's books are great, you have to read them in order, as the story builds with each book. Great plots, well-written, keeps you on the edge of your seat, never boring.
B0058A119G|5.0|Simply uncanny that she sounds this good pushing 70. In incredibly good voice--a few creaks here and there, but when she's on, she's spot on.  Very complex song choices and the 'actress who sings' delivery make for an engrossing collection. While you may long for the belting power that once was, today's matured voice has mellowed and refined with age, and wraps its silky glove around these gems like the pro she is.  Every song is a winner. Much, much better than Love is the Answer, it's her best album in years.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|This is a great movie. It's probably the Best movie Matt M. has done since U571. The story line is great and it keeps you in suspense. The picture quality on Blu Ray is nothing short of perfect. The sound quality is also excellent. It's 7.1 surround sound. WOW!!!    This is a must have for your collection.
B004KO803G|4.0|I dig it, good hard rock.  Tasty and distinctive guitar sound, singing and songwriting.  I worry that inconsistent production of the rhythm section/their sound or something is going to end up holding them back.  At first Bass / drum / rhythm guitar felt a bit generic and not as inspired as the rest of it on some of the tracks (such as Malverde, Painted Parade).  Thought it might be intentional, something along trying to be understated and quirky a la Modest Mouse?  I dunno.  All I can say is what I get out of it, y'know?<br /><br />Nah.  With a bit more listening, I don't think it's the rhythm section's playing, I think the production has them flat and down in the mix on some tracks but not others.  When I crank it, I'm not feeling the bass or drums punch me in the gut on all the tunes (and believe me that's NOT the fault of my system!)  It's a drastically better in a couple songs, like 'Wired','Throw Up' and 'Number Thirteen'.  I hate not giving 'em 5 stars but they can't have the bass and drums only show up for half the album.<br /><br />Anyhow, stoked to find out about Red Fang, and doubly stoked to learn that they're from just up the Valley.
B00005N6KG|5.0|When reviewing these I am keeping in mind that they are under $10.  If you are expecting $100 earphones you will be disappointed.    But at this price point, these are a solid 5 stars.    They are comfortable, fit in my ear better than apple.  They stay put because of the small, very flexible headband.  They are durable (i had my first earphones for a probably 5 years before needing to buy more).    I have tried headphones of all prices and styles.  My goal is to find something that I can easily exercise with and not worry about it being damaged by sweat or coming out of my ear.  These are perfect.  Sound quality is fine for the price.  My extremely expensive headphones sound better---but these are good enough--especially when exercising.    I would highly recommend.  I just purchased 3 sets--one for myself and 2 for my kids.  everyone in my family prefers this style.
1401924751|5.0|Angels have been there assisting with the readings and were dead on with the information that I needed to know...not necessarily what I thought I was looking for or should know.  The angels are extremely helpful and spot on.  I have combined decks for different insights and cannot say enough how well this has gone for me.  These cards work.  The messages are clear.

B004IE9X5W|2.0|I downloaded the sample chapter to read with the Kindle App for iPod Touch, and the line breaks were all weird. Maybe not a problem on a real Kindle? I haven't had this problem with other books.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|Purchased a used copy thru Amazon Marketplace.  Interesting take on the Hollywood standby of Robin Hood.  Russell Crowe looked like a grizzled warrior, and Cate Blanchett was wonderful.  Some of it was a little contrived, (like Crowe as a small child being able to read),but overall it was a good relaxing movie.  Lots of action interspersed with comedy.  Loved Friar Tuck, who isn't a religious monk. Great acting from all the supporting players and very nice scenery.
0446530573|5.0|I love this book!  It is hilarious if you are \\"Sopranos\\" addicts like my husband and myself.  If you're not, it's still a great Italian cookbook.  The photos are terrific.  I collect cookbooks and I absolutely had to have this one!
B003U9KZ80|4.0|The first woman to knock five Billboard number ones off an album, Katy Perry must be doing something right.    Listening to Teenage Dream reminded me of the 80s - melodious, fun pop songs set to a dance beat with great choruses. In other words, fabulous party music for most folks.    After the irresistibly catchy California Gurls aired on radio, I sampled the CD. It sounded so good that I got this without any hesitation. I think tracks like The One That Got Away should be a great single to follow the others like Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).    I don't really get E.T. What's with Perry asking her alien lover to \\"fill me with your poison\\"? The same with Lady Gaga. \\"Poison, inject me\\" she sings in Dance In The Dark. If you watch the videos for Madonna's Bedtime Story and Pet Shop Boys' I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Anymore, you will notice that they are injected with some blue liquid. It's kind of scary.    The bonus disc Dream On features Katy's collaboration with Timbaland called If We Ever Meet Again, Starstruck and two remixes of California Gurls and one of Teenage Dream.    Having a sweet tooth, I love the confectionery theme Katy uses. Besides the huge cakes in the booklet, the whole package is scented like candy. It smells so heavenly that I couldn't wait to sink my musical teeth in!
0470638842|4.0|Erik Qualman has written a terrific and insightful book about the world of social media and the increasing role it plays in business.  I work at a local television station and I am always on the hunt for fresh new ways to get my message out to the viewing public, to increase my station's footprint in the market.   Social media is that \\"fresh new way\\" and I find that this book is able to help me achieve that goal.  There are several \\"well, of COURSE, I knew that!\\" moments but even more \\"Why didn't I see/think of that?\\" V-8 forehead slapping moments.  I like it, and I recommend it.  Sure, not the most dramatic or exciting way to end this review but if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my social media marketing!
0321012542|4.0|This thing is huge.  It has some colorful art pages in the beginning.  I am pretty satisfied with this.  It arrived as expected.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this as a gift to my girlfriend who has been hooked ever since getting first book. She has spent nearly all of this week inside her house reading this book. It's that good! I never knew the Hit HBO series Game of Thrones, that got 3 million viewers in its last season finale. Could make it any better, the book though is more detailed. It adds stuff that you can not see see in the series on DVD. I bought this I believe On Friday and selected one day shipping. They delivered it on Monday (Saturday they couldn't find the address) though my girlfriend assured me the seal wasn't even broken on the package, it was fresh and brand new. Why pay 10 dollars for a single book, when you can spend 20 and get four? It's a highly addictive series.
0062060554|5.0|Before I Go To Sleep will go down as absolutely  one of the very best books I have ever read. \\"Christine's\\" story will be with you well after you've finished the last page.This is one of those books you want to \\"race\\" to the finish to find out how it will end:but hate that it has to end.  5 stars is not nearly enough.Buy this book,give it as a gift to your friends, but by all means keep  a copy for yourself. Once someone borrows it,you'll never get it back. I don't know what S.J.Watson did before she became an author,but her life will never be the same.

0765365278|5.0|As an avid Wheel of Time reader (9 times so far - you must read the entire series each time new volume is released!), I was pleasantly surprised with how BS completed the last 2 volumes after Robert Jordan died.  I hadn't read any of BS's other novels (a failure soon to be rectified!), but the size of this one, and my experience with his WOT novels lured me in.    Very few novelists can write a book more than 300 pages, and staggeringly few can do one over 500.  But, when an author can quickly set the characters, world/era, situation, and mood of the novel, and then pull you in so deeply that you cannot (literally) put the book down for more than 1000 pages; that is a Master!    My one non-positive comment was the relatively minimal use of the paranormal.  They talked about the various Shards and Fabrials, but they weren't \\"used\\" much by the characters.  Hopefully he includes more of that in later volumes.     However, as with any addiction, the crash landing at the end is rather shocking!  Where are the rest of the pages!!!!!  :(     How will I ever last until 2013 for Volume 2!
B00005NRN9|5.0|AWESOME video with a fantastic message and WOW on the talent and the entire production of this DVD!  Just wonderful!  And, it arrived in record time.
B004AFQHKS|5.0|I love books over 500 pages!  Especially when an author can quickly set the characters, world/era, and then spends the majority of the novel pulling you deeper and deeper into it.      On the down side, however, the crash landing at the end when you're forced to come back to the real world is rather depressing :(  How will I ever last until 2013 for volume 2!
B000WCDI64|5.0|This is a great showcase of a great artist that left us too soon. The concert is great! The documentary is very interesting also. A must have for any music fans!!
087033039X|3.0|When I purchased this book,and it was a hard bound book,I was under the impression that it would look like the picture that was used to promote the book. However, the book arrived in somewhat of a drab colored cover,obviously used, looking like an old ledger, the only I.D. was on the spine and it was in very old,dull,gold tpye; Leather braiding Grant.
B000002AP1|5.0|i love this remix, which leaves the original sounding hollow. Iggy probably peaked with this one, but for some reason Bowie did some odd things to the mix, which always irked me. This mix is beefed up and full of raw manic power-- and that's listening to high end headphones. i don't know why some people prefer the rathe effete Bowie mix-- just got used to it I suppose. This is a classic-- Iggy high and free.
0061726826|2.0|There was a lot about Delirium that was promising. The whole premise<br />of love being eradicated, of it being called a disease is fascinating.<br />The people who are cured are loveless. Never displaying too much<br />affection, living their lives with a partner they're matched with,<br />never singing, or anything. Everything you loved becomes nothing. It<br />means nothing. Something you might have loved before becomes meaning-<br />less. Someone you might have loved before becomes meaningless.<br />\\"I love you.\\" is never heard, never whispered.<br /><br />Lena never wanted to fall in love. In fact, she counted down the days<br />until she was to be cured. To me, this is a little weird because her<br />mother was not cured. Her mother let her have a taste of the life<br />people had before. But Lena is stickler for the rules. Always worrying<br />about getting in trouble, until she meets Alex.<br />That's how it always happens, right? Thus starts the true downfall.<br />He's liked her from the start, he's bad for her, he's even kinda<br />stalked her, all of this is vaguely familiar.<br /><br />I wasn't even a fourth of the way through when I noticed I was<br />skimming. Skimming, for heavens sake! When you enjoy a book you do not<br />skim. I honestly forced myself through this book up until the end. I<br />got a taste of what I wanted out of Delirium. It became exciting and<br />dangerous and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The end was what I found in bits of the dialogue and scenes throughout<br />the book, it was as if something groundbreaking had finally occurred.<br /><br />This doesn't change the way I feel about Delirium, but it does give<br />me hope for book 2.
0439023521|4.0|I was intrigued by the premise, a future dystopia where the ruling class, as a way of wielding power and punishing a rebellion, hold games where children/teens are chosen through a lottery to compete to the death and the 'games' are viewed by everyone on television. It's a little Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" a little Gladiator, a little Survivor. Collins is an excellent writer and draws her characters well.<br />My only criticism is that about halfway through it began to feel as if she was straining to keep the plot going, inventing problems which didn't seem to evolve naturally, and a few times I lost the 'fictive dream' and thought it was getting too ridiculous.<br />It's the first of a trilogy, and I don't plan to read the rest, but I'm glad I saw what all the fuss was about and, as I said, I was impressed with her writing. It was definitely worth reading. Try it!
B0041KKYBA|4.0|The premise of the movie is great.  I was angered by it at first viewing.  But have watched it again and can see some of the things that folks with lower reviews are saying.  But where the movie lacks detail in diving more into Fannie/Freddie and the government's role, it's still shined the light on the fact that people got rich while others went broke.  By choice or not.      For every film made like this made, you will have critics and the film can be picked apart.  But for me the premise is there and clear and that we have people living in this country that are willing to turn a blind's eye to things that they know are wrong.  Yes, you probably had homebuyers who know they couldn't really afford to buy but there had to be someone across the table that knew that too and ignored it instead of doing the \\"right\\" thing and telling them no.      Someone made the point that no crime was actually committed and that nobody knew how bad it could potentially be.  C'mon Son!!!  Why would you allow for something to be modified or repealed after it was put in place after the first crash to protect banks and it's consumers?      Yes, you can say that the film should have dug deeper into Freddie/Fannie and the government but from what I see, there were alot of things shown that were on point.  It's interesting how the detractors of this film leave out the fact that the film won the Oscar for best documentary.  Now I know that some of the Oscar voters share the same views about what really happened as the detractors of this film. But yet it won an Oscar.      Speculation and the unsolvable formula for deriviatives is what makes Wall Street smarter than everybody else and gives them the \\"balls\\" to do what this film said it did. They say art imitates life and I think that Oliver Stone is the best at it... So how far off was Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps from this film and reality????
B002ZG99QS|1.0|When the original Tron came out in 1982, I was a rabid fan. The idea of a computer outsmarting its users and reaching global domination was a popular theme for the time, a la Wargames. You were introduced to five characters whose lives were intertwined with one another, and who also possessed counterparts in the digital realm.    The remake bears no resemblance to the original. As with many movies nowadays, the movie centers around action, not plot and charater development. We are barely introduced to the main character before he pulls a ridiculous stunt on a company he himself owns. From there, we see a familiar face in Alan Bradley, but he is given maybe twenty minutes of screen time throughout the whole movie. Sam goes to his father's arcade, enters a code, and is transported to the digital realm. There, without even being taken to a holding cell, he is placed in the 'games', until his identity as a user is discovered by none other than Tron (another actor with a full mask, with a voice over by Bruce Boxleitner). He is then introduced to Clu, who seeks to destroy him via another confrontation, this time on light cycles. As Sam is about to be killed, he is rescued By Quorra, played by Olivia Wilde, his father's 'apprentice'. A father and son reunion ensues, followed by a race to beat Clu to the I/O tower.     This movie was made, as another reviewer said, to capitalize on the short attention spans of the younger generation. The characters (with the exception of Jeff Bridges and a very short appearance by Bruce Boxleitner) are the only redeeming things in this movie. The computer circutry has been downplayed in favor of a streamlined, flashy look. Here, instead of a couple of characters joining forces in a common goal, we have the all too common father-son reunion, and the confusion and anger that follows. Hot chicks in latex abound, there are enough strobe lights to give a normal person an epileptic attack, and Tron has been reduced to a character who does nothingbut make short appearances.      Good visual movie, but there's no way in hell it will stand up to repeated viewings. It just doesn't have anything deeper than sex appeal and flash. No substance. One star for Jeff Bridges.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My daughter (21 months) loves trucks. This toy is perfect for the price. There are a lot of pieces and the pictures are easily identifiable as the different types of cars, trains, buses, etc. We have an insert tub (not tile) and the pieces stick to the wall when wet without a problem. My daughter doesn't use the track that is provided but I'm sure as she gets older she'll figure it out and use them.
0385736002|4.0|OK. So I've finished The Alchemyst #1. It is the story of brother and sister Josh and Sophie, fraternal twins who are quickly caught up in the world of magic and mythology and legend by Josh's employers Nick and Perry Fleming who turn out to be the Flamels, famed alchemyst and sorceress. Fortunately or unfortunately for the twins their destinies were foretold in an ancient book called the Codex and now they are irreversibly linked to a world where myths and legends have more than a grain of truth in them.<br />This first book of the series introduces Josh and Sophie and the dilemma facing a world the twins are destined to save or destroy because these two have extraordinary dormant magical powers. They must come into their own and learn to control these powers while being chased by a maniacal magician Dr. John Dee and his dark (evil? possibly) allies.<br />I thought this was a well-developed and well-researched book. The interconnectedness of each character with historical facts was very well done. For young readers, this book gives the opportunity to explore world history, literature, mythology and science without cracking a textbook. Although after reading it I'm sure they will want to look up some of these facts for themselves. I have not checked the facts for myself yet, but it could easily be done.<br />Although a great story, well paced and interesting, it does become predictable in parts for someone like me who has read many books about fantasy and magic and watched countless movies in the genre. There were places where the answers to a strange new character or place were obvious, yet Josh and Sophie seemed slow on realizing the truth. But for a young reader, this becomes a journey not only for entertainment but for knowledge as well. It will definitely peak the interest of the reader in many different areas including history, art, science and geography.<br />It was a very quick read for me on the reader on my phone even at over 369 pages. There was a considerable amount of \\"name dropping\\", like one of the characters knowing William Shakespeare. I didn't care for the characters seeming to know many of the famous people in history myself, but again is a great device to link the fiction to fact and continue to create that suspension of belief that allows us to enjoy reading books like this.<br />Good book for the target audience of young adults, exciting, very dark in some places, but on the whole entertaining.

1594202842|5.0|It's not a parenting guide book buyers be aware. It's a more like a auto-bio, author is telling her own story of family, heritage and parenting. Amy Chua told her story in a   bold, brutally honest, yet hilarious way.The author didn't refrain from illustrate details of her single minded,strong will, driven and bossy personality     I enjoyed reading this book although I am by not means a \\"tiger mother\\" nor will I intend to be one, but there are some good points that Amy Chua boldly pointed out, such as \\" nothing is fun until you get good at it, and kids on their own just don't work hard\\" ,\\"parents know what's best for their children, but children don't\\" etc. This books gives a good shot of morale boost to every dedicated mother.     There are some prejudice the author didn't bother to leave out of the content like she thinks no Chinese kids have ADHD as if ADHD is a result of slack parenting,\\" crafting leads to nowhere, only playing piano or violin is a high culture hobby \\" All these details tie in with the cultural theme very well. After all ,being  driven, competitive is part of the Chinese culture. It's very intelligently written.    If you intend to raise your boy in Amy Chua's tiger style, you should be warned first -Chinese superstitions point out it could be detrimentally dangerous .As we know male brains are wired differently . Coincidentally most of tiger mothers are bond to have only girls-which is another widely approved Chinese superstition-and the mother daughter dynamics seem to reinforce the assertiveness in tiger moms.
B00006FDCD|4.0|This miniseries movie scared the crap out of me when I was a kid...long before I ever read the book. King's novel is exponentially more terrifying, but the miniseries is a relatively faithful adaptation (come on, there's just some things they can't show you on TV). I didn't find this series as horrifying as I once did, but you really have to give Tim Curry credit for creating a truly eerie and sinister version of Pennywise. He'll probably haunt my nightmares forever.
B003ITZBW2|4.0|when i rented this off of dish network free, i was blown away from the story to the animation. even the cast was the best i've heard. i'm a fan of supernatural, i thought for the voice talents, i'd go for it & rented it. all of the above is really a pleasent surprise. the dvd itself is great picture & sound, too. i have to say the only thing i didn't get w/it was a commentary. i wanted to hear the track, but they didn't have one for it.  it's been a while since i got back into the dc aniamation films. i'm glad for the right choice, now i'm an amazon member, i'm proud to know when i buy these dvds. i'll be using them. when the $ is good.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I'm sure by now we've all seen these movies (there's at least one of them playing almost any given night on one cable network or another), and anything that can be said about them individually probably has been said far better than I could. So, I'll just talk about the set itself. The Blu-ray versions are a marked improvement over the DVDs, which were already pretty good. The HD transfer is breathtaking, and almost made me feel I was watching the movies for the first time. The 5.1 digital soundtrack seems even better and more heart-pounding as well. The special features are excellent but be prepared to spend some time because there are a lot of them. If you loved the Matrix from the start, you really need to see it in HD.

B003DZX44I|5.0|To me this movie was one of the first \\"modern\\" Disney fairy tales that ushered in a new whole new generation of animated features. Like \\"The Little Mermaid\\" before it, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is a beautiful and morally important fable. From Belle's perspective, it tells us that you can't always judge someone on first meeting them...no matter how gruff they might appear. The Beast learns that love will only come to you when you treat others as you'd have them treat you. And don't forget all those fantastic songs! I've always loved this movie, and it holds up as well today as it did 20 years ago.

B00335EQ0E|4.0|I've enjoyed Alice in Wonderland since I was a kid, long before I could even begin to appreciate the hidden meanings and double entendres you'll find as an adult. It's a classic piece of animation from Disney, and remains a magical journey for parents and their children alike. Insane and beautifully drawn characters and a fascinating storyline make this movie remain one of my favorites.
0385339682|2.0|About halfway through this book I turned to the front and counted how many books the author had already written before this one...16. So this is his 17th novel. Like many other reviewers, my overall criticism is there is a lot of padding or \\"fill\\".  I have no idea, but it seems like the motivation to write this book might have been low and he just wasn't focused on how this novel was going to turn out.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Yes, you've heard correctly...Avatar does seem to run a little long. But it's well worth the time you'll spend watching it. James Cameron has outdone himself with the CGI spectacle he's created here. The Navi are very believable and the world they live in is rich and beautifully rendered. The storyline lacks a little at times, and even for an action star Sam Worthington seems a little wooden. Overall, though, it's an entertaining and stunning movie to watch.

B00506V2GA|5.0|Okay, I'll just state right up front that I'm an avid Hugh Laurie fan. Sure, I've seen every House episode multiple times to the point I've thought about seeking professional help -- I've even read Mr. Laurie's book, collected his Guitar aficionado article - pretty much anything he does turns to gold. But I kept an open mind (although I was probably the first in the country to get a copy of this CD) for his music. From the opening piano solo of St. James Infirmary Blues, this album is top notch. Not only can he play mean piano and guitar, but damn, he can even SING the blues like a native. You have to pinch yourself to remember that he's an upper class brit, not a black singer from Alabama at times (and he graciously acknowledges this point in the liner notes to the album that he makes no pretense of being from the south, eating grits, etc...) Well, okay, the blues singers featured on the album are amazing and show what professional blues singers can do and there are many legendary singers collaborating on this album. Mr. Laurie's singing might be a notch under theirs, but he sings with deep feeling and passion that honors the music and the genre. And what interesting arrangements -- I've always loved the traditional standards like John Henry -- I'm not sure who wrote the lyrics to this version or did the arrangement, but it's a great version - I challenge you to hear the opening line \\"John Henry had a little woman, and the dress she wore, was RED\\" and not love the intonation of RED - it just doesn't get any better. And the ending harmonies on \\"a cool drink of water before I die\\" could make you weep. In fact the song selection is what makes this album - I've listened to it now dozens of times, and there just isn't any filler (well, Whining boy would be my least favorite track, but minor gripe). The background singing and arrangement of Joshua and the Battle of Jericho is fantastic, You Don't Know my mind makes me want to belt it out while I'm driving, Six Cold Feet of Ground is a masterpiece - and we're only on song 3! Tom Jones rocks \\"Baby Please Make a Change\\" and Mr. Laurie does what might be the most memorable track, The Whale Swallowed Me. In fact, I think his blues voice kicks in the most on this track, so bravo to Hugh for pulling it off. I find myself singing Tipitina and Police Dog Blues (that doggone dog on me) all over town. I guess nothing Mr. Laurie does should surprise me, but  he has created one of the best albums of the year in any genre and certainly one of the best collectiond of blues and traditional songs. Now that he knows he's capable, I can only imagine the collaborations that lie in wait - he has a knack for the blues - I vote for more traditional black spirituals (maybe some of the music of Alvin Ailey's Revelations? Are you listening Mr. Laurie? You can dedicate the album to me :-), more blues standards and more of those under-appreciated classics he has brought to life. Now all I have to do is catch him in concert - the Youtube clips aren't enough. I guarantee you will be blown away by this album and impressed by the arrangements, vocals and great musicianship/instrumentals. Can I request in a concert somewhere in New England? I'll host the band at my house!of Ground is a masterpiece - and we're only on song 3!

B004LWZVZC|5.0|I saw this in the theater because I love the choice of actors. I did not expect to see such a profoundly beautiful & disturbing film.  I do like movies that make you think, give you pause & spur you toward further research. I also like movies that treat the audience as though they have a brain. This film does all those things very well.  Add to that a beautiful setting & artistic cinematography, & this becomes one of my favorite movies of this year.  I actually love that it is so non-Hollywood (no car chases, no sex scenes, no CGI), something completely different for a change. It's all about the story. The acting is wonderful.  James McAvoy seemingly can do anything & do it well. His acting in this is worth the price of admission. Robin Wright brings such energy to silence & stillness, she is very moving as a mother first & then a prisoner. Their scenes together are the crux of the movie & are powerful to watch. Kevin Kline & Tom Wilkinson are perfectly cast. I highly recommend this for folks who like history & want a great, beautifully presented story.<br /><br />Of note: There are hours of extras on this DVD. I was blown away by the historical information & the research that went into making this film. To address some charges leveled at the film's \\"agenda\\", the script was begun & nearly completed years ago (before Sept 11 2001), the courtroom speeches & closing arguments were placed in the script almost verbatim from the transcripts of the proceedings. And the movie makes no conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the main character....but it certainly does make you think.
0553801473|1.0|I admit, I quit reading halfway through. The drivel and fillers, the subpar writing, the lack of  plot progression and new boring POVs, made it clear to me I was taken for a ride.<br /><br />I believe some of the chapters were crafted by Martin (e.g. Reek), while most were penned by a ghost writer. Hence, the poor writing quality and far too many characters losing their erstwhile flavor (Arya being submissive? Give me a break...Dany a google-eyed teenager? Only if you are a mediocre ghost writer...)<br /><br />Bottom like: Martin is merely cashing on his success. There's a good possibility this book is the last in this series, since he apparently lost interest, or simply cannot finish it up. To me, however, it makes no difference; I'm off this gone-astray, wobbly wagon.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|The subject says it all! What would YOU do if aliens were on this earth to consume all of the water, and in the process of doing that, they colonized humans? That is exactly what this movie is about, and you would never know that this is fake! The CGI is just so real these days, and it REALLY showed in Battle: Los Angeles! This will be an hour and 57 minutes that will leave you breathless and out of words to describe the whole movie!
B005FRF6PC|5.0|I am enjoying the Rafa memoir.  Initially, I wondered how a memoir could be written so early in this young man's life, and not be \\"fluff\\" for over 270 pages.  I quickly learned that not only is there no fluff, it sucked me in as a reader.    The format is almost like \\"Forrest Gump\\" in print.  It starts with Rafa prepping for his 2008 Wimbledon match against Roger Federer, the slam he's always wanted to win.  Rafa writes somewhat of a diary/journal entry of his thought as he gets ready for the match.  And as he goes through these motions, he has \\"flashbacks\\" of times earlier in life that has gotten him to where he's at:  lessons he's learned, the family's who's been a solid foundation of support, and the human side of of who Rafa's become of these things.  The flashbacks come back to the present match and integrates itself whole.    Once a short entry of that match is read, John Carlin interjects with words and mini vignettes/interviews from family and friends who fill the \\"gaps\\" of the thought processes of how Rafa thinks and what he's become.      The story then heads back to that Wimbledon match and Rafa writes more.  The cycle continues.    I bought this book right as I was about to go to sleep and ended up reading nearly 20% of the book and took it to work to read during my lunch.  I could not put it down, but had to because the eyes were drooping.  At this rate, the book will not make it to the weekend.  Rafa draws me in and paints a story of an every day man who happens to do something extraordinary professionally.  Nadal speaks with desires of a simple life and yet, with a profound sense of thought of in how to approach it.  Tennis is the backddrop of this story, but many life lessons are learned as well as we watch someone grow into their own.    UPDATE 9/9/11:  I finished the book and it was quite satisfying.  The memoir covers the first 25 years of Rafa's life, but there was much that's happened within that time:  mentally, physically, and emotionally.  Rafa and Carlin explain the moments in time and their impact upon who Rafa is today and will become.      Is the book premature in its writing? Yes and no.  I thought that the book should have been done after his career was over so we get the \\"full scope.\\"  However, by writing the book now while still actively competing, Rafa lets the readers understand who and what he is now.  I have been following Rafa throughout this 2011 U.S. Open and the memoir has shed a different perspective on how I view Rafa's mentality on court, for the press, and how he carries himself.  In short, it's an even more intriguing 'front row ticket' into someone's life.
0307200477|1.0|This book fell apart and I had to return it. Don't buy this book if you are thinking it is sturdier than the original, smaller version.  I thought because it is described as a boardbook, that meant it wouldn't have the silly plastic spiral bounding.  Well, it still has the plastic spiral bounding, it's just inside and spirals through the hardcover.  The problem is that it repeatedly came out of the outer hardcover--i couldn't get it to stay together so I returned.  My second-born can just read the older, smaller version that is already roughed-up.  I love this book in general and it is great for babies/toddlers, but I just wish they would make it as an actual board book.
B0058A119G|3.0|Well, these 2 CDs are sooooo slow and sleepy, I can't recommend them unless you want something to put you to sleep.   The songs are gorgeous; the 2nd CD, of course, is just full of repeats of what she has already recorded.   I have most of Streisand's music, so I did not need this one.   Such an extraordinary talent - it was just the wrong idea to have every single song sound the same:   too slow, quiet and sleepy.   She can do much better.   I hope she gets some energy for future recordings since the last 3 have been really slow and boring - especially the one with she and her husband on the cover and all the songs are about how she finally found love and is going to cling to it forever and make us all hear about it in every song.   I wish she would spend more time making movies and organizing a political rally for WE THE PEOPLE; and not them the ignorant racist tea baggers or rich corporations.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|Take a bit of \\"Bourne\\" and mix it with \\"The Fugitive\\" and you get \\"Unknown\\".  That's basically the plot of this nifty little thriller starring Liam Neeson and a very good supporting cast which includes Aideen Quinn, Frank Langella, Diane Kruger and German veteran actor, Bruno Ganz. In fact the pivotal scene between Langella and Ganz threw me for a loop because it was so well acted and written which is unusual for a action movie of this type since good dialogue is usually not a hallmark of action movies.  The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is because January Jones as Neeson's wife was quite wooden and stiff in her role but perhaps that's why she was chosen since as the plot unravels we begin to understand her role more fully in the movie.  Nevertheless, if you like Neeson and action movies in general, you won't be disappointed.

Lucky me, that I´ve seen the film in it´s uncut form and it´s really a shame that no one seems to have the guts to bring this gem out in the version it was intended by the director. As far as I can remember the distributor for America said they will bring out the unrated version of this movie. So let´s hope for the best and as I use to say: Hope dies last!

B004FEJ3VY|2.0|This is the most disappointing movie version of Optimus Prime.  His truck mode looks sloppy and his robot mode is frustrating. His arm \\"kibble\\" gets in the way of posibility and make it difficult to hold his weapon. Having the wheels on the wrist is even worse, in my opinion, than the \\"backpack\\" that the first movie Optimus.    This one does have some interesting concepts in the transformation, but that does not moke up for the problems encountered.    He also comes with many mechtech ports in truck mode, but has none in robot mode. He can only hold them in his hands.    I can't even recommend him to Optimus collectors. As one myself (I have the voyager mode from all three movies, the leader class from the first two, and the legend classes as well - not to mention from other series), I would recommend the deluxe exclusive that Walmart is offerring instead.

1416596585|2.0|PRO:<br /><br />- The book offers a handful of amusing anecdotes<br />- The book confirmed my personal guesses about how Larry and Sergey think<br /><br />NOT-SO-PRO:<br /><br />Other than that it's a thinly veiled advertisement with a goal to paint Google as a radically different, new, revolutionary kind of business. What it achieves though, coupled with reader's own observations, is proving that Google is nothing special.<br /><br />The book left me wondering \\"Why did I bother buying it?\\"<br /><br />Why do I call it an advertisement? In the opening pages, Steven Levy mentions how secretive Google is. He hints at a special level of trust he enjoyed. And here he is, with a full featured book on Google. If they did not authorize a single comma, his grandchildren would be sued off the face of the Earth.<br /><br />Why do I claim that Google is no different? Well, their management practices may be, but the idea behind Google is good old \\"let's keep selling stuff and invest profits into researching new ways of selling stuff\\".<br /><br />According to the book, Page and Brin never miss a chance to mention how they are eager to improve the world; how Google is going to be different and better. According to the book, Google has already accumulated enormous power - but where is the trumpeted improvement of the world? What they have been doing so far was taking an existing idea and making it faster - what is radically different about it? They have no customer support - maybe this is a revolutionary improvement?<br /><br />If I were touting a company as new, unique and aimed at improving the world, it would be a company that uses its wealth from the old world to blaze trails in the new world:<br /><br />- buys patents and liberates them<br />- hooks up the whole world to the fast, reliable Internet<br />- uses its communication might to make representative democracy obsolete through global individual voting<br />- develops a new, non-hierarchical, uncontrollable DNS<br /><br />In short, \\"radically new\\" today means \\"geared towards individual liberation\\". What Steven Levy peddles as \\"new\\" is what 2011 Toyota Camry is to 2010 Toyota Camry. It can only be called \\"new\\" in an advertisement. Oh, wait.<br /><br />I used to be an unbending Google fan. I admired their obsession with honestly finding things out, rather than settling on \\"good enough\\".<br /><br />This book helped me understand that Google is yet another business meant to improve the lives of nobody but a handful of people at Google. By marketing themselves as a mind-blowing breakthrough they turn into hypocrites, which is the dirtiest word in my vocabulary.peddles as \\"new\\" is what 2011 Toyota Camry is to 2010 Toyota Camry.

It is now positioned within reach, so I can adjust it on the fly, and is now positioned closer so I can see what is reflected easier.  I am not a weight weenie, but, hey, for the investment in a carbon bike we want our bragging rights regarding being able to lift the bike with just two fingers.  I am a petite 59 year-old woman.  Okay, so maybe I am a weight weenie.
B0056369RO|3.0|LMFAO is definitely on to something really fun. After listening to their hit single and really awesome music video for Party Rock Anthem (recommend everyone check it out on youtube) and their other really fun music videos I decided to buy the CD. Unfortunately aside from their really good singles there is only a couple of other songs on the CD that are up to the same quality level. None of the bonus songs on this special edition are particularly good either.<br /><br />Still a great band, and I don't regret buying the CD. I just wish the other songs were less interchangeable. I look forward to their future music.

This book covers the politics, science, & psychology of having curly hair. It will show you how to appreciate, grow, & maintain healthy & beautiful curly hair. It is packed with the most unexpected and surprising information about the destructive nature of commercial shampoos and other damaging \\"beauty\\" product ingredients. You will be amazed!

To hell with shame, hiding, and narrow minded beauty standards! This book is a heartfelt gift to all of us who grew up fighting and struggling against the gift bestowed us. It is strangely exhilarating to anticipate \\"coming out curly\\" for all the world to see! Can't wait 'til my hair gets longer!     Gotta go - am ordering this book for several curly friends! Already spreading the word! This book is worth it's weight in gold! Many thanks & blessings to the authors! Viva la curly girls!

It didn't dissapoint but the opposite. It's an amazing book very well written in her unique inviting way to try all her recipes right away. I've done at least 20 recipes...all of them fabulous! Thank you Nigella for being an inspiration.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I believe that know the history of women and mental hospitals will open your eyes to what this movie is all about. I also believe that those events of the past still occur today too.     If you don't know the history and you are unable to follow different realities, especially in story telling then you're not going to like this movie.    I found the movie to be much more profound than I expected and the way that all three realities meet at the end brought me to tears. It's a sad story that's been told before, but told in a fresh new way that is not only relevant today but more importantly incorporates the way that the mind of today's young people works.
0307477479|2.0|I think Karen's review hit the nail on the head.  I read about this book in magazines, newspapers, and on websites a good year before I actually read it.  Acclaim was everywhere.  So I read it thinking this was going to be the next great American novel.  I can appreciate some of the experiments Egan does (like the part with the PowerPoint presentation), but I read this book feeling very disconnected with it.  I didn't care for any of the characters.  It took me awhile to catch the connections between the characters and to remember who everyone was in relation to the others.  Overall, I would not recommend this book to others.
034544678X|5.0|I love this book and read it cover to cover twice when I first got it!  While, this book isn't a step by step training manual, it does offer indispensable advice on how to get behaviors you want from your dog as well as stopping unwanted behaviors (not to mention having a great and rewarding relationship with your dog!).      I love the anecdotes included in the book. While some are a bit sad, they do help me to retain the concepts presented. I think this should be required reading for anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting one!     The author discusses dog (and human and primate) behavior in detail but she also writes in depth about being a dog owner. This is much more informative than most books I've read on getting a dog. She talks about selection (and common pitfalls), raising a puppy (which won't be a puppy for long) and what it is like to share your home with a dog. She paints a very realistic picture of dog ownership from selection all the way to grieving the loss of a dog.     I know this may not look as appealing as a cute book with lots of pictures about getting a puppy, but if you're thinking of getting a dog, I promise, this is a quick and valuable read.
006113399X|4.0|I was in the middle of reading this book just as the attacks on Oslo took place.  It was interesting and disturbing to hear about an attack from a racist, anti-immigrant Norwegian (I don't think he's classified as a Neo-Nazi or maybe I just haven't read that specifically), and the book deals with Norway's past and present relationship with the Nazis and their legacy.  I agree with others who found the book confusing at times.  There are characters who may have several names, and at times I wasn't exactly sure who was who...To tell the truth, I still couldn't properly explain the switching of the bodies at the battlefield.  But the book got exciting, and there are some story lines that continue on into the rest of the Harry Hole series.  I admit that I'm torn over which books I like better--the Stieg Larsson \\"Millenium\\" trilogy or the Harry Hole series, but I definitely think if you're sad there will probably never been another Mikael Blomkvist book published, try Harry Hole.
B00579EL18|4.0|Even allowing for the cuts so often made during this era at the Metropolitan Opera, this is one of the swiftest of the live four Act versions and the sound is really very good for a mono radio broadcast; consequently it gives you a compelling sense of the excitement of the occasion under the experienced baton of Kurt Adler, who had conducted a similarly distinguished cast in this opera in 1955. The cuts - the whole of the Fontainebleau Act, of course, this being the four Act version, plus excisions in the Third Act auto-da f&eacute; and the final sublime duet - are all the more regrettable considering that Corelli never made a studio recording of \\"Don Carlo\\" but we must be grateful for what we have. It was a favourite opera that saw him through the seventies until he had virtually retired; he clearly identified with the haunted, neurotic Carlos.<br /><br />The cast features five Met stalwarts in Corelli, Leonie Rysanek, Irene Dalis, Giorgio Tozzi and Hermann Uhde, whereas Posa was distinguished Romanian baritone Herlea's debut role at the Met. Many consider this to be the best of the available live performances of Corelli as Don Carlo, although the 1970 Vienna recording also has much to recommend it in that it has a superlative cast and gives little sign of Corelli's supposed vocal deterioration by this date. Here in 1964, the famous bronze squillo in the tone and the expressive diminuendo are both much in evidence, as is Corelli's artistic licence - which some call sloppiness - and his pronounced lisp, which on the evidence of the duet from\\"Aida\\" he made around the same time with Callas seemed particularly pronounced that year. There is an awkward pause just before the Flemish deputies issue their plea to Philip when Corelli missed his cue, then they carry on.<br /><br />Apart from the expected pre-eminence of Corelli in the eponymous leading role, the special pleasure for me in this performance is Herlea's vibrant, Italianate baritone as Posa. He was evidently determined not to be over-awed either by the occasion or his temperamental tenor colleague and matches Corelli in volume and intensity, sustaining a nobility of line and brilliance of tone which is well nigh perfect for this heroic baritone role. He has splendid top notes and even a good trill. Corelli seems to fear that he is in danger of being upstaged by his stage-mate and consequently throws in a slightly precarious and not very musical high C to conclude their duet in Act 1, \\"Dio che nell'alma infondere.\\"<br /><br />Irene Dalis, despite not having the largest or most refulgent of mezzo-sopranos is clearly a very intelligent and able singer who has the resources to manage both the \\"Veil Song\\" and \\"O don fatale\\" - not always the case with this role. She has a vibrant, smoky, seductive timbre which is ideal and handles the coloratura adeptly and agilely. She is also a good vocal actress who sounds both vindictive then truly remorseful without resorting to over-emoting.<br /><br />Giorgi Tozzi, who died last May at 88, was originally a baritone and occasionally that shows in a lack of sonorousness in his low notes, such as on the low F at the end of his monologue and some loss of resonance in his soft singing. He is more impressive in louder passages when his steady, imposing tone cuts through the surrounding textures. I find his characterisation of the weary king a little applied and blustery; he too often sounds angry rather than melancholy and thus lacks the massive inwardness found in the Philip of Christoff, Siepi and Ghiaurov. He also as a tendency to drift sharp in the soliloquy but his confrontations with il Grande Inquisitor and Rodrigo are both stirring and dramatic, if not very subtle. Uhde is black and menacing of voice but struggles with his top E and F.<br /><br />Justino Diaz is noble, steady and implacable as the Friar/Carlo Quinto; it's a part which although brief must not be under-cast if the opening and ending of the opera are to make the required impact.<br /><br />In my survey of the singers thus far, you will note that I have left Leonie Rysanek till last. This is because I cannot quite decide what I think about her Elisabetta. I am used to the fact that in live performance she usually took a while to warm up and that the strange, hoarse croon in the lower ranges of the voice would ease off as the opera progressed. I continue to be delighted by her shining top notes and the amplitude of the sound she makes but equally irritated by her habitual swoop and scoop in to phrases. The dark colouring and occasional hoarseness in her tone is in many ways redolent of the unrelenting sorrow and suffering undergone by Elisabetta, that most doleful of Verdi heroines. She rises to her last great aria, floating notes exquisitely on \\"Francia\\" and \\"Fontainebleau\\" and delivers superb top B's and B flats which sound almost disjointed from the main body of her voice. She certainly creates a rounded character and always delivers the text convincingly but listening is not always comfortable when she is \\"wallowing\\" into a note. She was always a favourite with the Met audience which responds enthusiastically to all the artists here.<br /><br />The standard of instrumental playing is variable; neither of the introductions to Acts 3 and 4 constitutes the orchestra's finest hour and intonation can waver alarmingly, but by and large Adler directs a tight ship.<br /><br />This, alongside the 1968 \\"Die Walk&uuml;re\\", is probably the most desirable issue so far in this Sony Metropolitan series. It certainly represents the best of Corelli in this particular opera but is more than that, in that it enshrines a thrilling performance by a first-rate cast recorded in mono sound so good that one forgets it's almost \\"historical\\". There are many good recordings of this opera but none encompasses all its demands and most serious collectors will want several versions of both the four and five Act versions in Italian and the French recording conducted by Pappano. In that context, there is certainly room for this slim and very affordable issue on your shelves.<br /><br />There is a synopsis and cues but obviously no libretto, this being a budget set.note that I have left Leonie Rysanek till last.

1442419814|5.0|Recently I have been reading a lot of YA sci-fi fantasy and future dystopian society books and so far this has been the best one with the exception of Divergent. I loved how the main character Tally was so like other teens now and is struggling to determine whether she wants to be different or blend in with the crowd. I feel that even with the potential downfall of the *spoiler alert* lesions in the brain from the 'Pretty' surgery many teens would willingly choose to be pretty and oblivious then have to be ugly and have to live with those secrets. Many of the opposing reviews have stated that their main reason for disliking the book was because of Tally's careless and cowardly behavior but as a YA myself I can see others of my age acting in the same way as she did. The plot was very creative and it kept me reading until the very end, the romance was...interesting and sweet but not as intense which was nice for a change. I do agree that the book was very predictable but I think it was made to be that way, where the author wanted us to know Tally's fate even before she did. I also enjoyed the fact that humans of the 21st century were made to seem impulsive and unintelligent because of our habits of burning wood, cutting down trees, not recycling, etc. It was great to have a book that gave you an insight on what our possible future could look like. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys an adventurous main character and I would also give it to someone who usually sides with the popular opinion. This book opens up your view on what being 'pretty' actually is and whether it truly comes from the outside or the inside. It makes you ask yourself \\"Which would I chose?\\" I am looking forward to reading the sequel 'pretties' and I'm diving in with even higher expectations.
0451196716|5.0|This is maybe my favorite King novel, (and I'm a huge fan!) and a very psychological-horror read. All of the other good reviews are the same things I would say in praise, so let me just recommend you purchase \\"The Bachman Books\\" By Stephen King and get the long walk along with three other long-short stories and save on making separate purchases for each novel!  The running man (which I did not find to be at all similar to the Arnold movie) and Rage are particularly good in a similar way as the long walk...

0316066524|5.0|I don't want to try to summarize what I love about this novel. This is my favorite novel and so that would take a while and probably waste your time rehashing what other people have said better. Instead I'll try to address a few of the more common complaints I see here:<br /><br />The first is that there is no closure. This is correct to some degree, since many of the storylines in the novel - Hal's addiction, Gately's and Pemulis' fates, the Quebecois insurgency, etc. - aren't explicitly resolved. There are hints of what happens if you'd like to sleuth these out (I was lucky enough to read it shortly before Infinite Summer, a sort of online book club for this, started, and luckily got to see the theories of cleverer people), but I'd argue that even those are unnecessary. The way I like to describe it is that Infinite Jest is too good to be constrained by a plot. Instead, these storylines are really just avenues for exploring some very interesting concepts: addiction, achievement, depression, loneliness. Moreover, these avenues are populated by some very well-drawn characters, some of whom are pretty repulsive but most of whom are so deftly fleshed-out that you can somehow empathize with them anyway. And momentarily inhabiting such realistic characters (narration is often limited-omniscient, albeit confined to a variety of different characters at different times) is such a rich experience that, to me at least, it more than makes up for a scant plot.<br /><br />The second is that the book is hard to read. This is true in parts, and there are more than a few words in here whose meanings I still don't know. There are a lot of footnotes, a common theme in DFW's work, which can be bothersome but not horribly so. The beginning is especially slow going because the characters are unfamiliar and confusing and, especially if you haven't read any of DFW's work (I strongly suggest reading some of his essays before this), you may not have the reservoir of goodwill to get you through. But once you find your footing about a hundred pages almost all of the remainder is  very readable. Sure, there are portions that can be pretty technical. There's an exposition of a Risk-like children's game that involves a jargon-packed discussion of nuclear warfare, for one, but I enjoy taking these digressions to learn a bit about the subject, and at any rate they're often skimmable if you so choose. More prevalent, to me, were sections of wicked humor. Infinite Jest has a lot of hilarious exchanges, events and descriptions. As an experiment, I looked for the funniest thing I could find in 10 seconds, and here that is: someone is selling sterile urine to beat a drug test, urine that's described as \\"warm pale innocent childish urine that's produced in needly little streams and the only G/M scan that it couldn't pass would be like an Ovaltine scan or something\\", and this sort of thing is all over the book (though it's a little more scarce toward the end). Real, laugh-out-loud humor. Sometimes broad, sometimes subtle. There's also a lot of exploration of how people think and behave, which is much more realistically felt and appreciated than I can describe, and which draws more empathy from me than any other novel I've read. At any rate, I think the best thing I can say about this book's readability is that I still pull it off the shelf occasionally, just to read a random section and either laugh or savor its ideas and prose, or all of those things. Not because I want to impress anyone; not because it's some book-medicine, required but unpleasant; but because it's really pleasurable to read.<br /><br />So to summarize, if you want a novel that will introduce a problem, detail its solution, and tie up any loose ends (in other words, a conventional story), you may want to look elsewhere. But if you want descriptive prose, sharp humor and emotion, and a thoughtful exploration of a very wide variety of subjects and experiences and characters, give this a try.
1416595554|5.0|If you read and liked Figes' \\"The Whisperers,\\" \\"Sashenka\\" is a must read.  Others have already told you the plot, so I won't rehash it.  I will tell you that it is a long and twisted journey that will be worth every minute you spend on it.  This novel is one part Russian history book, one part Russian spy novel, and one part tragic love story.  The three blend beautifully into the best book I've read in a long time.  Though it is not based on a true story, any reader versed in Russian history knows that it could be.  This book is absolutely worth the read.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|It was new, still in the plastic wrap which was what I was hoping for. the only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it had every thing on the box written in french (or some other language) as well. the title, the summary on the back... wasn't expecting that. but over all it was good :)

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book should come with a warning label: WARNING: DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU CAN COMMIT ENOUGH HOURS TO READ IN ONE SITTING. Once I picked up the book, I could not put it down. I had a ton of mixed emotions when it came to Travis, the main male character. His physical description sounded yummy but there are too many things about his personality that would drive me away. The whole book was well written and endearing with a roller coaster of emotions. Despite my wary feelings toward the lead male character, I still give the book 5 stars.
0800130928|5.0|Okay I'm a major film addict but somehow it took me 34 years to get around to seeing this film. Just in case there are still a few stragglers who still have not seen it, here is a list of spoiler-free reasons to rent or buy and watch it now:<br />1) Buy/Rent the original version of the DVD - the new cover is a spoiler!! (or get the cover free blue ray from Netflix)<br />2) The film is violent but not as bad as I feared - Scorsese used subdued color and artistic filming to keep the R rating<br />3) Thin, gorgeous De Niro<br />4) 13 year old Jodi Foster able to match De Niro's charisma and acting excellence<br />5) Cinematography, from minute one where the taxi emerges from the man hole steam - awesome!<br />6) The origin of a line (that's been re-stated in uncountable movies since) impeccably delivered<br />7) Urban, 70s, NYC<br />8) Albert Brooks sporting a curly headed fro<br />9) The gritty, pounding soundtrack<br />10) Ticking time bomb of a story that builds for 90 minutes and then delivers a bizarre, amazing climax<br /><br />Non-spoiler synopsis: Travis Bickle (De Niro) is a heavy drinking, pill popping night shift taxi driver living a solitary existence and suffering from insomnia who will drive anyone anywhere. He wears a paratrooper style jacket with a faded \\"Bickle\\" on the back. He is not exactly a dullard, but has real trouble properly reading social situations and has a childlike quality about him. When he speaks with 12 year old Iris (Jodi Foster), for example, they interact almost like peers. Travis is clearly unbalanced, but it's not clear whether this is from war trauma or birth. He keeps a journal and narrates throughout. As time goes on the viewer is drawn into his reality and desire to act to \\"clean up\\" the filth (literal and figurative) rather than being a passive observer of it.<br /><br />Note that 80% of this movie is De Niro, all other characters, including Jodi Foster, are in supporting roles.

It did not diminish the enjoyment of the book, but to my way of thinking it should have been sold as \\"used\\"-not \\"new\\".
B000TV12NO|5.0|This recording was released 2 years after Melody Gardot suffered near fatal automobile accident, the differently able Gardot triumphing in accomplishing what many others, including her, could only dream of. This project has her singing and playing guitar and a little piano, but more so presenting this project of all original material. She definitely walks a fine line between jazz and folk but her voice is rich and full of nuances that suck you into her stories. This is a must have for any music lover.
B000025KNI|5.0|Very simply, this is a fantastic CD.  I don't think I can pick out my favorite song because they are all good.
B004SB60OC|5.0|What do you get when you mix Sarah McLachlan with Sheryl Crow, then add a dash of Dolores O'Riordan? Christina Perri. Fantastic debut album. The more often I listen to it, the better it gets.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I purchased the program mainly for the barometer and barograph readings due to weather related migraines. The program allows you to update in as little as 10 mins. Support responded same day. Confusion in terminology sea level pressure and 'pressure' which is relative pressure as reported by your local airport as 'altimeter'. Only drawback, cannot move program to SD card.  Using LG Optimus S on Sprint.

B004VQK9XW|4.0|Just like the Heroin Diaries; has 1 GREAT song, 5 or so VERY GOOD songs, a couple average songs and few songs I could live without. All in all, I find myself listening to this CD or at least parts of it all the time. Overall it's a very solid follow-up album.
0545259088|5.0|A worthy end to one of my favorite YA series.<br /><br />Reading Forever was bittersweet.  I'm so sad to say good bye to Grace and Sam, but I couldn't help but love each and every chapter.<br /><br />Whenever I talk about Maggie Stiefvater's writing with people, this is what I tell them:  the writing is beautiful, almost musical; her characters are richly layered; and her stories are just this side of fantastic that you easily get swept up and allow yourself to breathe the same air as her characters.<br /><br />I rarely re-read books.  When I do, it's special.  This series is among the few that I can say I have read at least twice through already.  I'm already looking forward to the third time.<br /><br />When I first saw a review copy of Forever, I actually got to meet Maggie soon after, and I said to her, \\"It's RED!  What does that MEAN??\\"  If you look at the three covers (below) in the trilogy, you'll see they are blue, green, and red.  Each color has a meaning - I love that.<br /><br />I don't want to talk about Forever...I still don't want it to end.  If you haven't read this series yet, start with Shiver and enjoy!

1423124960|2.0|I got this book for my daughter's birthday on Aug 11; she has not read the entire book yet and it is falling apart.  The first few pages are completely out of the book and it looks like more are starting to come out.  My daughter has a LOT of books, and she reads a lot.  This book and her other Disney Princess early chapter books are the only books we have a problem with the binding not holding.  She has read some of her other books many, many times with no problem.  The Disney Princess books fall apart before she has even read it once, much less several times.
B0043URV8M|5.0|This is a must for every Harry Potter fanatic. The first piece of music on the soundtrack is \\"Obliviate\\" and it gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it and that's why I purchased this album. The music is beautiful, mood capturing, dramatic in places and poignant. I was not disappointed.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Legend of the Guardians was my most anticipated movie of 2010, and I was not disappointed at all. This film is a masterpiece, from the story to the very realistic visual effects. I saw this movie twice in IMAX 3D, and my money was well spent on this flick. The visuals are so breathtaking, it almost made me cry. The characters are pretty engaging, as well. My favorite character is Gylfie, because i found her to be cute. So, Legend of the Guardians is a fantastic movie. I need to read the books by Kathryn Lasky.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
1594744769|3.0|I think my expectations for this book were way to high because this book definitely left me feeling ... disappointed. I thought the book itself LOOKS awesome. I love the hard cover, the look of the pages, the paper - etc. Visually I liked the book. But when it came to the story I just wasn't happy with it.      I say borrow this book from the library, or a friend, or buy it used on Amazon. It's worth a few books and a few minutes of skimming thru it.    Check out  my blogpost if you want more information: [...]
0553801473|5.0|I fear Game of Thrones is going to end up like the aptly named \\"Wheel of Time\\" series - the book is a zillion pages long and Winter is STILL coming (when will it arrive?);  Dany still can't master the dragons; Bran still can't walk; Arya is still in Braavos; Tyrion is still my favorite character (please don't fall in love with Penny, that would be so un-Tyrion-like)...Cersei is still a shrew and Jamie just went missing (???)...The book follows along (in more detail from other POV characters) what was going on in Feast for Crows,  so while the story is interesting and well written, the plot advanced very little.  I was hoping to there would be a little \\"sum'in sum'in\\" going on with Jon and Dany by now, but by the time they finally meet, all of the Lanisters will have died from old age, the realm will be a democracy.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I LOVE GRRM and the series; I just don't want to have to wait another 6 years for the next installment.  I fear that the HBO series will be complete before the novels and that would just be irritating.<br /><br />For fans of the books I don't have to even say this is a \\"must read\\" - - for the newly initiated, if you just started with book 1, I recommend you read slowly and perhaps by the time you get to Dance With Dragons the last book will be out.<br /><br />Sorry, GRRM I'm not hating, I'm just anxious :-)

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app so much I'm writing my first app review ever. I use this app for my weekly grocery list and errands checklist. I know there are other grocery app but I like the simplicity and easy convenience of a quick item add. I like that you can move items up and down in the list, this helps me organize my shopping according to the store layout. Five stars from me.
0739367676|1.0|Enjoyed the spoken word novel up to the point where it no longer worked. Amazon was very good about a refund.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've read a lot of great books in the past year but none approached this one.  Total nerdvana :-)  The book picks you up, makes you geek out on 80s arcade games and moves inside the OASIS for a wonderful ride, and deposits you back into the real world with your only thought being \\"WHAT?  This is his first book?  There's nothing else by him to read???\\"  The ending is even satisfying, which is a tough thing to do it seems, so I can't wait for more books by this author.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|I loved the show.  It was intelligent, good stories and the main actors were great at their job.  Each week was interesting.  Unforunately I guess it was not like the majority of TV shows which are boring comedies or cheap sci fi movies with bad actors the channel likes to show.  FireFly was also a great show cancelled also.  Intelligent TV that makes you think is cancelled.  Why because the majority of the people want shows where they don't have to think.  How many police dramas or lame comedy shows do we need?  I guess enough to fill people's minds for 3 or 4 hours a night.  Can't there be one or two good sci fi tv series on TV?
B0051T47NQ|3.0|Yes, this one takes its style and structure from the Blair Witch playbook, but the trolls make all the difference. The filmmakers haven't tried to make their trolls look plausible or somehow alien; these trolls look like something from an illustration in a kids' book of fairy tales: they have multiple heads, cartoonishly bulbous noses, a galumphing walk, and, true to legend, they like to lurk under bridges. These trolls are also very, very big, and the director, Andre Ovredal, deserves credit for making them more menacing than that critter in Cloverfield, despite the fact that trolls are, well, silly.    The plot, such as it is, has some eager college kids deciding to make a documentary about Hans, a man they suspect is a bear poacher. This early part of the story isn't setup very well, but it serves to get us to the trolls. Hans, it turns out, is actually a trollhunter employed by the Norwegian government to keep trolls in check. The government wants to keep trolls hush-hush, but Hans is tired of the secrecy and lets himself be filmed. What follows is something of a nature documentary as Hans talks matter-of-factly about the natural history of trolls. We also see Hans at his work, which consists of tracking down rogue trolls and killing them with light. Trolls, as all Norwegian kids know, die if exposed to light, or, in this case, a battery of lights mounted on a truck.    The climax of the film takes place on a snowy plateau where Hans faces off against a 200-foot tall mountain troll. It's at this point, if not before, that you realize this film looks as good or better than most Hollywood creature features, and that's with a budget of only $3m. All is not perfect with Trollhunter: the college kids are superfluous, and the film cries out for a bit more humour (these are effing trolls!), but  it's certainly a lot of fun. In fact, I'd be willing to watch a Trollhunter 2 as long as they keep the budget low.     Read more of my reviews at JettisonCocoon dot com.
B0000524E5|1.0|Coyote Ugly is a movie about a young woman who moves from her father's home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. To make ends meet, she finds employment at a bar and dates an Australian orphan. In the end, she succeeds and produces her own album. She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure.
0307477479|3.0|I've read all the Pulitzer prize winning novels and when each year's selection is made, I look forward to sinking my teeth into it. This was certainly no exception - in fact my expectations were even higher than usual. It seemed that A Visit From the Goon Squad had made every summer reading list and it seemed that everyone I knew was either reading it or had read and loved it.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't grab me the way it seemed to grab others. Yes, she is a talented writer. Yes, she did a superb job of switching between narrators and writing convincingly from numerous points of view. But at the end of the day I would describe the book as ultimately forgettable. None of the characters stuck out for me. I was never properly taken in by the plot.<br /><br />Would I have enjoyed this book more if I'd picked it up off the shelf and had no expectations? Probably. But I believe that I would have still found it to be less than exceptional.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|While numbers continually dropped in the 19th century American frontier due to murder and disease, what truly conquered the \\"wild west\\" was technology. The rapid enumeration of product patents and their proliferation throughout the western territories: the laying of railroads, replacement of wooden structures with brick, the development of communications advances, and the personal automobile all transformed the place we know of as the Old West into its modern equivalent.  Sonnenfeld here has cleverly respun this history in the form of a narrative story, sometimes metaphorically accurate, and sometimes hilariously inverted. When gunslinger Captain 'Jim' West (Smith) and master-of-disguise 'Artemus' Gordon (Kline) are paired up to defeat the psychotic Confederate and mad inventor Dr. Arliss Loveless (Branagh), it's an idealistic winner takes all in the battle between the traditional west and the technological Eastern invasion. Of course to throw things further off-kilter, Sonnenfeld has made our protagonist, West, a black Civil War hero. With 20th century concepts of individual vs. corporate control, sexual promiscuity and identity, and racial equality and acceptance, \\"Wild Wild West\\" recasts this unique historical period to its modern viewers.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|\\"Jane Eyre,\\" oh Jane Eyre, Charlotte would have loved this version of her book writ large on the big screen. I was so wowed by this film: actors, setting, costumes, and a true transformation from paper to celluloid or a digital rendering. Breathtaking, emotionally rich, and ultimately satisfying, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is utterly true to the book.<br /><br />I rather smiled in reading that another reviewer thinks Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester. That means she has not seen the version with Orson Wells. But I nitpick. Michael Fassbender is superb. Mia Wasikowska is superb. Jamie Bell is excellent (if you can allow yourself to call someone so uptight as excellent, but I'm describing acting). That's it then. That's all you need to know, except the location IS the wild setting of the novel.<br /><br />If I had to pick the most effective aspect of the film, I would tap Director Fukunaga's decision to use a flashback to tell the story. (I don't remember if Charlotte actually wrote her novel this way.) He begins with Jane running, running away from Thornfield, from Rochester. She finally collapses in abject misery, wailing and wailing, with the lonely moors, the stunted shrubs as her cold comfort. She finally stumbles, in numbing despair, at the door of the Rivers family.<br /><br />By the time the flashback wends its way back to the moor scene, the viewer must wail with Jane,  empathetically, completely caught up in her intense feelings for Rochester, instead of coldly watching this scene. The viewer now understands Jane's terrible illness--it's not of the body but of the spirit. Healing does come, and when it does, it allows for a glorious, but bittersweet ending.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre.\\" Jane Eyre. A fabulous story, a strong character. Either way, definitely a winner! Highly recommended!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|As a lover of myth, folklore and fairytale I was absolutely enchanted by this movie. I do believe that storytelling is a direct route to our psyches, especially all of our collective unconscious as humans who share trials and triumphs with each other and forever wonder how we rate as individuals. Daniel Wallace has created an endearing world within a son's imagination of the father he desires to know. As a daughter I can embrace this same longing with both my parents. The beauty of our minds and souls is how we can indeed fill in the negative spaces with dreams and tall tales that somehow do reality and truth justice within the reflection. I loved this movie for all it had to share. A lovely though temporary subtraction of oneself while staring at a two-dimensional pixel screen mechanically inhabited of recorded and projected images, and I recommend it to everyone.
B0058A119G|5.0|This album is simply a beautiful work of art. Beautifully sung;orchestrations are lush and romantic. This cd is a throwback to a different era when lyrics and music told a story.  The Bergmans are brilliant and Barbra does each and every one of these songs justice.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I've been a fan of the Harry Potter books for many years and have found most of the films a bit disappointing, although entertaining. But with Deathly Hallows, Part 1, the film team has finally lived up to my expectations. The script stays much closer to the book than most of the previous installments, with a lot of the best dialogue from the book included word-for-word. The trio of young actors turn out their best performances yet, with Rupert Grint giving an outstanding performance as Ron. I loved every minute of this film.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Amazon has once more had what I was looking for. These are classic movies. We will enjoy them for how ever long they last. Watch them over and over. Horses are such a pleasure to watch and to see people treat them with such respect. Toby is wonderful also.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I had to add my review to the others because it is so great to find a work-out product that really works.  I did this for 45 days, and I was really amazed at how effective it was.  After seeing all the muscles appear on my body where I'd had flab before, my husband started doing it too.  He started seeing results after only a few days, so having the testosterone must help too.<br /><br />I am not a dieter type, but apparently Jillian has a diet you can follow on her website.  I didn't look at it, but if you are like me and are no good with diets, I can suggest what works for me... No processed food.  Just cook it all from scratch.  Otherwise, I can say that this kind of workout really did convert fat to muscle, even without me going on a special diet.  I am over 50 years old, and the droopy upper arms that just seem a fact of life at this age have been replaced with slim, lean, muscular arms that I'm not ashamed to be seen in sleeveless tops.<br /><br />All you need is a yoga mat, a pair of dumbbells, and space to workout in front of your TV - and a towel to mop up all the sweat.  Then give it about 25 minutes out of your day.<br /><br />The caveats - it is really, really hard. It may just be 20 minutes, but it really takes \\"everything you've got.\\"  Also, there really isn't any advice about how heavy the weights should be, but the weights the girls are using in the DVD don't look too heavy.  I started with 3 kilo dumbbells.  I found them too heavy for a couple of the exercises, too light for a couple of others.  I would suggest starting with something light and learning the moves first, then deciding what weights work for you.<br /><br />It is a great feeling to know you can improve your body even over 50!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is a great movie. I actually watched it by accident by viewing my on demand premium channels with my cable provider. I turned it on to see what it was about and was glued to my seat watching the rest of it. It really does open your eyes to who the crooks are in the White House, Federal Reserve, and other government associated entities. Why we haven't given some of these criminals the boot, I don't know. Party affiliation is irrelevant. Republican, Democrat, whatever! Crooks are crooks, and this movie makes it blatantly obvious. How sad that we are still allowing these people to manage our money. They should be fired and put in jail. If any average Joe on the street did what they did, they would be serving a 20 year sentence right now. This is a must watch movie for sure. After I saw it, I immediately purchased a copy from Amazon so I could show this to family and friends.
0553801473|4.0|well, it's actually a continuation of book 4 or, it runs concurrently with book 4.  if this sounds complicated... it is.  if you have read the 1st 4 books, you are already hooked and are dying to know all about...?  if you haven't read any of them yet,  be prepared.  this series is no light read for a weekend working on you tan.<br /><br />i knew all of this, and i bought it anyway!  if you are fan of A Song Of fire And Ice this will be your cup of tea.  if not...  try re-reading tolkiens ring trilogy.  it's lighter and shorter.

B004XIQIPQ|4.0|Let me start by saying that Arctic Monkeys' \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" is one of my favorite albums of the last 5 years, period. It was a brilliant album from start to finish (and much better than the over-hyped debut album, but that's another story). Imagine my disappointment then when Humbug was released. Over time I warmed up to some of its songs but it isn't anywhere close to being brilliant. Now finally comes the band's highly anticipated 4th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Suck It and See\\" (12 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with a gently \\"She's Thunderstorms\\", followed in the same vein by \\"Black Treacle\\". \\"Brick by Brick\\" comes with a bit more bite. \\"The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\\" is pleasant. \\"Don't Sid Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair\\" (1st UK single) is, BY FAR, the best track on this album, and one of the few to feature what I'd call the \\"classic\\" Arctic Monkeys sound. \\"Library Pictures\\" is another one of those great songs, bursting with energy. The second half of the album kicks off with a very promising \\"All My Own Stunts\\", but \\"Reckless Serenade\\" is a song that threatens to bust out, but then doesn't. \\"Piledriver Waltz\\" is interesting in that a different version of this appears on the Alex Turner solo project soundtrack for \\"Submarine\\". After that the album stumbles to the end. In all, not a bad album, but not a great album either. Two or three gems is not enough in my opinion. I've waited several months to post my review to see if I'd get more excited about this album, but I haven't unfortunately.<br /><br />I was at lLollapalooza earlier this month, and Arctic Monkeys' set was delayed a good half hour due to a severe thunderstorm. When the band finally came out to play, they fired on all cylinders bringing a fantastic set. The songs from \\"Suck It and See\\" they played live (Dont Sit Down; Library Pictures; Hellcat; and given the circumstances of course She's Thunderstorms) sounded much better in concert than they do on the CD. I'm not crazy about this album, but Arctic Monkeys remain a top live band, that's for sure.eys remain a top live band, that's for sure.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Really great game! It's like watching the movie almost. Only thing is it's super easy. Definitely worth the download!  Word.
B0054DFIIM|4.0|I picked this album up while recently traveling in Scotland, where I got it for an amazingly low price, which was even better considering as well that for whatever reason this album has not gotten a US release yet. There has been quite a lot of noise around the release of this album, in particular since the band digitally made available 20 songs from which fans could then purchase and make their own personalized album by choosing 10 songs. But then some time later the band announced, to everyone's SHOCK (wink-wink), that a traditional CD would be released as well. Here that CD.<br /><br />\\"The Future Is Medieval\\" (14 tracks, including 1 \\"hidden\\" track; 53 min.) kicks off with a hard-charging \\"Little Shocks\\" and is then followed by an interesting (Bowie-sounding) \\"Things Change\\". \\"Long Way From Celebrating\\" is what I'd call a \\"classic\\" Kaiser Chiefs song, reminding me of the Employment/Yours Truly Angry Mob sound. \\"Starts With Nothing\\" is a psychedelic-influenced song that I like a lot. \\"Out of Focus\\" brims with energy. But the highlights are fewer on the second half of the album. \\"Kinda Girl You Are\\" rolls on but then is followed by a slightly futuristic sounding \\"Man on Mars\\". Please note that after the last track \\"You Will Have Me\\" there is about a 7 min. silence before the hidden track comes on, an outstanding instrumental song that is actually one of the better tracks on here!<br /><br />In all, there are some good moments on here, but there is also too much \\"filler\\", and the album has a difficult time finding a groove. Also not enough \\"hooks\\" to keep me interested throughout. Not to mention that the album's running time is far too long. Cut out the weakest 2-3 songs and we have something to work with here. But in the end, this is Kaiser Chiefs and this is better than 95% of the stuff you hear on mainstream commercial radio these days. I've seen Kaiser Chiefs in concert several times over the years, and guaranteed they put on a great live show. Hope to catch these guys live in support for \\"The Future Is Medieval\\".support for \\"The Future Is Medieval\\".
0060263857|5.0|Every year I read Charlotte's Web to the kindergarten class, I am amazed at how engaged they are (and how engaged I am) in the story.  Much of it stems from the barnyard setting-a place where few of our children spend much time.  It's just plain fascinating for them. Then there's the suspense of what will happen to Wilbur, the pig, what will Charlotte do with her web and, ultimately, what will happen to Charlotte herself. The novel teaches many life lessons in a charming, but practical way. To be cliche, E.B. White has spun a strong web that will hold its reader forever.<br />Bernardette Costa<br />Author, The Six Colorful Annies
B005CMGKTG|4.0|I saw this movie in Hong Kong, earlier this year.  I made it my mission to see this movie in a theater, instead of waiting for the DVD.  It's not Star Wars (the original trilogy, mind you).  But, if you are/were a Star Blazers fan - you MUST see this movie.    While the plot is a shortened version of the original epic TV series, it is ultimately a re-imagined story.  The result contain some hits and misses.  This is not the Star Blazers of our youth.  Some very adult themes are played out, within the backdrop of Earth's possible demise at stake.  Certain scenes are over dramatic, acted out in hammed-up Shakespearean style, to the point where it was almost ludicrous.  All I can say is, military officers should have more self control, but it is sheer fun.  The plot is in a way reminiscent of Michael Bay's \\"Armageddon\\".  The Earth will be doomed, if a small band of human beings do not put their differences aside, and fight for humanity's last chance at survival.      Susumu Kodai, a troubled ex-fighter pilot, rejoins the Star Force after \\"discovering\\" (to put it mildly) a message pod from the far distant planet of Iscandar.  His return immediately clashes with Yuki Mori (female lead, played by the gorgeous Meisa Kuroki) the Yamato's ace fighter pilot, and squadron commander.  As the story unfolds, old friendships are renewed; old bitterness resolved, and a new romance flourishes.  However, despite courageous actions, disciplined training, and dedicated hearts - lives are lost and their mission seem doomed to fail.     The message from Iscandar, offers a cure for Earth's irradiated atmosphere, and a possible alliance.  In light of this, hopes of the people of Earth is renewed, after having resolved themselves to their fate.  Human extinction had seemed eminent, after the devastating defeat of almost the entire Earth defense fleet.  Causing much of Humanity, including our protagonist, to simply give up.  In the beginning of the story, Kodai himself was just a wrech of aman, a bitter self-pitying individual scavenging the wastelands of Earth's surface.  He blames Captain Okita for the death of his brother.      Gathering their remaining resources, the United Space Force's last Battleship is refitted and reconditioned in secret.  Once preparations are completed, and the mission to Iscandar given final approval, the world government offers to the devastated population of Earth one last hope.  They reveal a bold plan, to send off a single crew, aboard the last space-worthy vessel, across the vast span of interstellar space to accept the help of an unknown intelligence.  The Space Battleship Yamato, will make the immense journey to Iscandar, even with little hope that they will ever return.  For the Gamilas has blockaded our entire planet.  When Yamato launches, breaking free of the rock and rubble that has partially encased it, there was definitely a lump in my throat.  In grand Japanese-style, the music soundtrack reflects the boldness and epic nature of their undertaking.  Was the ship partial buried to hide it from the Gamilas?  Is it possible to sneak past their blockade?  It no longer matters.  Once the ship started its journey, the Gamilas are upon them - all the way to Iscandar.  But can it be that simple?  Is there such benevolent beings in the universe that they would reach out to a distant people, just to offer help?  Not quite.    Along with shoot em' up action sequences, there's the subplot of exactly who or what the Gamilas really are, or why they want to destroy us.  In this updated version, the enemy isn't just blue-colored people, the Gamilas are now a race of crystalline creatures devoid of conscience, fear, remorse, or mercy.  Additionally, who are the people of Iscandar?  Can they, in fact, be the Gamilas themselves?  Is the message just some elaborate ruse?   There are some surprises, and some familiar plot points, for old and new fans alike.  The movie also does not miss an opportunity to pay homage to the real Yamato of WWII.  In a dramatic speech, Captain Okita reminds his crew of the previous incarnation of the Yamato, and of that crew's doomed efforts in defending Japan.  Regardless of the outcome, they will do their BEST!    The dog fights in space, were done with the pseudo-realistic zoom-and-shake technique, ala the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica.  The new CGI version of the Yamato is so realistic, it is worth the ticket of admission just to watch the vessel fly-by's, across gas giants and nebulae.  It's what I've always imagined.    The score for the movie is nothing short of spectacular.  A clear homage to the original from the TV series, but now done in grand orchestral scale, with ample use of a background chorus.  A chorus always make a piece of music sound more epic.  I also visited Japan recently.  While there, I came across the soundtrack in Tower Records - Japan.  Even though the Yen was way high compared to the dollar at the time, I felt that it was worth the investment.  I just couldn't wait for it to come to our shores.  Tip - Amazon.com sells it for the same price, so you don't have to go to Japan to get it.      What hope does a small band of Humans aboard a signal ship, with a handful of star fighters, and an untested weapon system have against the vast Gamilas armada?  Captain Okita: \\"Action stations!  Inform the engine room to disengage the main drive system.  Prepare to divert all power to charge the WAVE-MOTION GUN.  Kodai, man the targeting system, lock on enemy fleet, directly ahead.  On my mark: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1, FIRE!\\"
0553801473|2.0|The first two books were great, the third so-so, and then just way too many characters and unresolved plot lines exploded in the fourth and fifth books. Honestly, I find the grim, non-fairy tale characters very refreshing (bad things happen to good people), but I really wish an editor would have spent some decent time on the pacing and tightness of the main story.
B004GEGW44|5.0|This is a well-made production based on a story The Chimneys of Green Knowe, The story is set in 1940s England, where thirteen-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent by his mother to his grandmother Mrs. Oldknoe's (Dame Maggie Smith) family estate, Green Knowe. His mother remains in London, trying to get information on the fate of Tolly's father who is missing in action.<br /><br />Initially, Tolly resents his granny because he thinks she dislikes his mother, but gradually a close bond forms between the two. Tolly discovers that the estate is in financial trouble and that his granny may be forced to sell it. Tolly also makes another startling discovery - that the estate is haunted by the spirits of a previous generation of Oldknow's, mainly young Susan (Eliza Bennett) who lived in the house more than a century earlier. Susan's father, Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) is a kind seafaring man who brings home an escaped slave named Jacob and provides for him, expecting only that Jacob be Susan's companion, for Susan is blind. But Maria, the Captain's Dutch wife (played by Carice Van Houten of [[ASIN:B000TGCR38 Black Book]]) is not keen on the boy and spends her days squandering the Captain's wealth. The couple's only son, Sefton (Douglas Booth) is a spoilt brat who abhors Jacob, and finds ways and means to make Jacob's life miserable.<br /><br />Tolly finds himself not only able to see some of these ghosts but also to be able to travel back in time (it is never explained how this happens) and witness events in the past. This later proves fortuitous as Tolly makes an important discovery that could very well save his granny's estate.<br /><br />The story plays out quite well and is beautifully filmed. I'd characterize this as a family friendly drama - there is no foul language, no sexual scenes, and except for a few scenes where there is some bullying going on, no real violence.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Some are like that. We don't expect total fidelity in all details, but spiritual fidelity. I can't help feeling the last movie made Snape too different from what he is in the book. The movie glamorized and enlarged his part.    Snape as envisioned by Rowling would never have whispered tenderly to the baby Harry.  In the book, Snape was an mean, malicious, physically unappealing character who loved one person his entire life and who, with Dumbledore's help, which included tremendous moral pressure, stayed true to the side of the person he loved. Snape was on Voldemort's side until he killed Harry's mother.    Rowling said she always wanted Alan Rickman to play Snape. In the book, she continually refers to Snape's greasy hair and huge hook nose. If an actor that resembled what she wrote had been cast in the part, Snape would not be what he is to many, which is a sex symbol.     The final movie makes it seem as though Snape always liked Harry and just pretended to hate him. In the book, he genuinely hates Harry, but he nonetheless remains faithful to Dumbledore and the anti-Voldemort side, which is the side of Harry's parents.    The movie was a bit false to the spirit of the book, in that Harry's father was belittled in order to elevate Snape. After seeing the movie, some people got the impression that Snape was Harry's father, which was never intended by the author. In the book, the father was killed trying to hold off Voldemort to give Harry and his mother time to escape. Harry's father also once saved Snape's life when they were at Hogwarts together. The movie treats the father somewhat cavalierly.     Snape is instinctively on the Deatheaters side, but when he loves a anti-Deatheater who is murdered by Voldemort, he turns on that side. It seems that if Voldemort had not killed Harry's mother and had killed ever so many others, Snape would not have left that side. It is the murder of Harry's mother that turns him. That says something about the power of love, also revenge. Love elevates Snape and makes him stick to the anti-Voldemort contingent.     Snape also represents the struggle between good and evil in one person. He has to struggle to be on the good side. For some reason, such characters hold great appeal.
B003L77GRY|5.0|I have to say, of all the TV/Cable shows I watch (almost exclusively on DVD/Blu-Ray), this is the one that most makes me groan at the end of each episode, wishing it didn't have to end.  So many intriguing sub-plots and characters circle our dark hero, but unlike other shows, in which sub-plot and characters exist merely as threads alongside the main storyline, every filament of plot in \\"Dexter\\" Season 5 leads directly back to the man and the story at center.  The writers of this show pull off an amazing hat-trick of suspense in this outstanding and somewhat unexpected Season 5.    (Alert: Possible Spoiler Ahead)  If you're reading this, you probably know by now that Season 4 ended with the shocking (if textually convincing) murder of the character of Rita, Dexter's wife.  I wondered for a long time, waiting for Season 5 to arrive on DVD, how on earth this series would continue.  It seemed to me the show's creators had done just about all they could with the bizarre character of Dexter Morgan, and that there was little else to say following that bitterly ironic murder at the end of Season 4.  It amazes me that they not only found a way to move the story forward, but quickly developed an entirely fresh direction in the person of Lumen Pierce (Julia Stiles) which dominates Season 5.      Michael C. Hall is fantastic as always.  Lauren Velez and David Zayas (i.e., LaGuerta & Batista), are not only terrific as always in this season, but they continue to find nuances of character that are absent elsewhere in television depictions of Latinos.  Much as the character of Deb is over-the-top potty-mouthed and temperamental, I never tire of watching Jennifer Carpenter's work; she manages to make me care about Deb precisely as one would about a sibling whose heart (and mouth) are sometimes bigger than her brain.  Best of all this season, though, is the guest star, Julia Stiles, who makes the unthinkable seem terrifyingly real.    I loved the heck out of this season, and I can'timagine anyone who enjoys the series not being glued to every episode as well.

0763644765|5.0|I bought this book for my 20 month old son. We are just starting to introduce the idea of the potty and have set out his little potty for the first time. It has been a great book to get him interested in the idea. He loves to read the book and has been spontaneously sitting on his little potty since he started reading it. He has also started saying \\"bye bye diaper,\\" apparently his favorite line...
0062060554|2.0|A bit of an amateur effort, the first 2 sections of the book drag on without much anticipation. The only redeeming quality is the ending, though even that becomes predictable halfway through.     Good concept, but badly executed.

B000S81MHY|5.0|It was really well made, but when they say micro take them at their word, its small.  I love the quality and its made in Japan so it should last, but I think I will return it to get something a bigger.  Its totally my fault, just from reading the reviews I got the impression it was larger than it is and I just thought the micro was the adjustments for some reason.  Would be great for models or something like that, but I wanted one for my garage where I am always working on my motorcycles.  Small even for that.

The tip recently broke off of my HDMI cable because the cable plugin stuck out of the back of the TV too far and was smashed.  I bought this thinking it would alleviate the problem.  This adapter is HUGE!  It sticks out more than my original HDMI cable with no angle did.  It cost more to return it than it did to purchase it originally so i'll bite the bullet and keep it.  Did not do what i had intended and now is just collecting dust in my spare parts closet.  Oh well, bought a nicer cable with an angled connection built in and it works beautifully.

030788743X|5.0|Cover: Red with gold lettering similar to the bubble letters I used to create as a teenager in the 90s. It has a pixilated avatar leaping in one of the letters and a key in another. Both a homage to the story and the quest within. Brilliant!<br /><br />First line: \\"Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest.\\" Intrigued? You should be!<br /><br />Review: Breathless...<br /><br />What a magical ride READY PLAYER ONE was! I am already anticipating reading it again and discovering new parts I didn't discover the first time because I was reading so fast! Wade Watts is our 18-year-old protaganist and he draws you right in from page one. He is every man's lonely computer geek gamer. The only difference is it's the year 2044 and everyone is plugged into the OASIS, not just the \\"geeky gamers\\". Think Second Life except it's the way of life now - everyone is living first life there. Wade has been raised within the OASIS: educated in it, formed his friendships in it, lived the only life he's ever known in a virtual \\"oasis\\" of planets. In real life he's poor and surviving in a van so he rarely ventures very far with his avatar because everything in the OASIS costs real money. Which, since most people have nothing, the easter egg prize of Halliday's quest becomes crazy desirable.<br /><br />From the beginning I liked Wade. I got him (he got me). I have always been a techy geek gamer girl who is somewhat anti-social so I felt a kindred spirit with him early on. Even if you are the opposite of me, you will find something to relate to in Wade. He is just trying to survive the only way he knows how, with no parents, no live- bodied friends, no pets, no interaction or touch or feel at all. And he doesn't really have a choice. He barely has the necessities just to survive. Even through his tough circumstances, he is clever and quick-witted and worth getting to know.  You are on his team from the beginning.<br /><br />The quest itself is magical. Even if you are not a gamer, you will be enveloped by it. You can akin it to your typical scavenger hunt, except the world is vast, the clues require expertise and determination, the stakes are higher and the reward way sweeter. The reward is the ultimate gift: control of the OASIS, the \\"world\\" if you will. And man do you want to see Wade succeed in solving the quest. But of course there is an evil corporation breathing down his neck. They want to win and take over the reins of the virtual world, and they will go to any lengths to get to the egg first, even murder.<br /><br />I haven't even mentioned the best part about READY PLAYER ONE: the nostalgic references. If you were a child of the 80s or 90s or have any vested interested in those time periods, you will find yourself smiling and remembering your own experiences. Everything from the first computer, video games, movies, music, television - nothing is off limits, and it's all relevant. It was such a nice trip down memory lane, and I found myself smiling a lot. The goofy, awkward kind of toothy smile that makes you check to make sure no one is watching you with your moment.<br /><br />I would say that describes my overall feeling about READY PLAYER ONE. This book has it all. A great protaganist, really developed and interesting secondary characters that add a depth to Wade's story, an evil antagonist that makes you want to bear arms yourself, a sweet love story that makes you think what it takes to really understand someone and love them for who they are, throwback references galore...I could go on for days...<br /><br />Conclusion: JUST. READ. IT. Thanks be to the literary gods for Ernest Cline and the gift that was READY PLAYER ONE. I've already ordered my own hardcover copy so I can enjoy this one again soon. *5+ Kindle hugs*<br /><br />Copy origin: Netgalley.

0307271757|5.0|There are many different editions of the well-known and loved Charles Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol\\" available. Since the story is familiar to most people, this review is intended to describe the merits of this particular edition of A Christmas Carol, compared to other editions available.<br /><br />If you simply want to read A Christmas Carol, do not necessarily have any plan to keep it, and you want a low cost copy of it, then this is probably not the version you will want to purchase. This particular edition is expensive compared with many available (but it is very reasonably priced for what it is). It is hardcover, with high quality printing, acid free paper, cloth bindings, a silk ribbon marker, all features of good quality books. It is quite simply a beautiful book whether or not you leave the dust jacket on, or remove it.<br /><br />Also, this edition includes, in addition to A Christmas Carol, four more of Dicken's Christmas tales: The Chimes; The Cricket on the Hearth; The Battle of Life; and The Haunted Man, and incorporates a number of the classic illustrations done by Arthur Rackham.<br /><br />It also includes an introduction, written for this edition by Margaret Atwood ([[ASIN:0307264602 The Handmaid's Tale]]); a bibliography of other Dickens works; and a chronology listing significant events in the author's life along with corresponding literary context and historical events.<br /><br />I purchased this particular book for my own library, intending for it to be for my family and to pass on to future generations. If you want a top quality edition of A Christmas Carol, this is the one to get, in my opinion!
0857680986|5.0|At first glance you may chuckle at the 1940's hair styles and nude women in pumps. However, Andrew Loomis's books give easy to follow steps for drawing the human figure on it's own or in an environment with perspective. The illustrations are very good and easy to read. I use his examples as handouts in my figure drawing classes.

B00BHWG5C2|5.0|There's something that I just lo-o-ove about The Rolling Stones. I don't know what it is, besides the fact that they are the greatest rock `n' roll band in the history of the world. Maybe it's just that all of the cool, fashionable people like them; maybe it's the fact that they, themselves, are cool, fashionable people. In 1969, the year that I was born, the Stones went on tour to promote \\"Let It Bleed\\", one of the best rock `n' roll albums ever made (it contains \\"Gimme Shelter\\", how could it not rule?!?!). \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\" is a document of that tour, and it's just amazing. I can't believe I waited until I was 41 years old before I ever listened to it?<br /><br />This 40th anniversary edition of \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\" contains a CD of the original release, with its 10 songs (\\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", \\"Carol\\", \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", \\"Love In Vain\\", \\"\\"Midnight Rambler\\", \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"Live With Me\\", \\"Little Queenie\\", \\"Honky Tonk Women\\", and \\"Street FIghting Man\\"); another CD with five unreleased songs (\\"Prodigal Son\\", \\"You Gotta Move\\", \\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"I'm Free\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\"); a third CD with five B.B. King songs and seven Ike and Tina Turner songs; and, finally, a DVD with five clips that mirror the five unreleased songs CD, but also add backstage shots, studio shots, pre-Altamont shots in San Francisco shots and<br /><br />This concert captures the Stones just days before their infamous appearance at Altamont, so expertly captured by the Maysles Brothers in their film \\"Gimme Shelter\\", which I devoured a few months ago in its Criterion Collection form and reviewed here. This album is an extension of that film - the DVD contains 28 minutes of video from the Madison Square Gardens gigs that form this live disc, and there is some overlap with \\"Gimme Shelter\\" - Mick and Charlie going onto a frozen highway to shoot demos for the cover of the album with a donkey. Sure, it was Sixties madness, and these guys were millionaires, with the money to fund an entourage of filmmakers and photographers, biographers, anything.<br /><br />The DVD bits of the set are great. It starts off with text:<br /><br />\\"In 1969 the Rolling Stones set out on tour to promote the release of LET IT BLEED / It was the first time the world's greatest rock and roll band played the world's greatest venue - Madison Square Garden / GET YER YA-YA'S OUT! and GIMME SHELTER captured what many consider to be one of the greatest live rock & roll performances ever.\\"<br /><br />The DVD begins with shots of the Madison Square Gardens at street level, the marquee, and people walking by. Beautiful 1969 teenager faces, mostly white but some balck, nice long coats, long haired chicks, a few trendy guys, people who wouldn't look out of place in today's day and age, then the band walknig backstage - Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Mick Jagger, and Jimi Hendrix. Cool crowd shots mixed with cool Stones shots, and then the music for Robert Wilkins' \\"Prodigal Son\\", then more crowd shots, before we see Keith playing the steel top guitar, Mick singing, slapping his knees, grunting and groaning, crowd shots of beautiful women, the song ends unexpectedly, with Mick thinking it's going to continue. They follow it with \\"You Gotta Move\\" by `Mississippi' Fred McDowell and the Reverend Gary Davis, and tons of great crowd shots, including a young woman with a great look of wonderment - did any other filmmakers capture shots like this at the time? There's a long, miserable scene of Mick and Charlie trying to capture a photo for the cover of the live album, with a donkey, a helmet, a cape, a scarf, a sword, some guitar cases, a white Bentley. \\"It's fartin' cold. Just this silk thing between me and the weather,\\" complains Mick. Charlie with red pants, red socks, black shoes. A burro on the highway, and a crew of observers shooting it. The rain and sleet picks up, and Mick makes a move for his Bentley. There's a great shot of Keith Richardsplaying expert blues at the piano. Gorgeous. In the studio with a bunch of reels, at the console, and \\"Under My Thumb\\", the famous \\"Altamont murder\\" song, done onstage in the Gardens with its vicious guitar stabs. Jagger running his fingers through his hair, with his cape, his \\"omega beehivehair\\" t-shirt (I want one) and his scarf, the glittery belt and the buttoned pants. An experiment in slow motion that the Maysles Brothers did so well in Gimme Shelter (didn't come off so well here, being out of synch and all). Great bit of \\"I'm Free\\", which then goes into a backstage bit with Keith Richards and Jimi Hendrix sitting next to each other, having a word, talking about Keith's plexiglass guitar (Keith seemed cool, but he was probably nervous sitting next to Jimi). Later you see him playing a Gibson SG left-handed, doing the \\"Gimme Shelter riff\\". Then the video goes back into \\"I'm Free\\". The DVD shows a great version of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", with great crowd shots, a picture of Janis Joplin in a white fur hat, silk purple blouse (no bra), and a black vest and beads and boogying all over, hanging out with a well-dressed black dude. She seemed prety happy, despite being kicked out of backstage. Great crowd sots - chicks dancing on top of their seats, Jimi in a sheep fur jacket dancing about, and a sea of blanched faces, someone with a Raggedy Ann doll, groovy hippy chicks, an Asian woman with straight long hair, every other scene is of the crowd going crazy, Jagger sitting on the stage, waving for crowd response, a girl with a lightning mark across her face, more shots of Janis, Charlie Watts in the foreground, another shot of Mick throwing the rose petals into the audience, the crowd scrum, a kid on his mother's shoulders (New York had hippies too, it seems). Slowdown as Mick moves offstage, and the film blur effects come up. Back to the backstage at Altamont area, with none of the ugly vibes shown in \\"Gimme Shelter\\", Jerry Garcia and Paul Kramer hanging out in San Francisco, Mick and Charlie zoom in, tries to figure out what's going on, solve problems. Mick's only 24, but he's a totally on boss, taking charge of the event organisation, then some scenes with Michelle Phillips, kissing her forehead, and \\"okay, we cut.\\"<br /><br />The booklet is a masterpiece, with the endpages showing the band with the newly-recruited 22-year-old Mick Taylor (and, keep in mind, Mick and Keith were 26, Charlie Watts was 29, and Bill Wyman was 36 (and, to date, he's the only septagenarian Stone - although Charlie's close). The booklet shows photos from the band's practice space in a basement studio in Stephen Stills' house in Laurel Canyon, then a larger rehearsal stage (which was on the Warner Brothers' set for `They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\\"), there's a crowd shot (and was there ever a more beautiful crowd in rock `n' roll history than at that gig?) before we see a sample shot of the album cover that might have been that shows the old starts and stripes top hat (with its obvious joint), passports, belts, cigarettes, photos, beads, fur boas, and all sorts of other stuff. But, with a joint so obviously there, how could it be used? Mick, by this time, was probably learning to be a hardnose boss and getting what he wanted. I know people like that.<br /><br />The booklet continues, with a shot of the band getting in a limo, with nearly everyone facing away. What's the point of a two-page shot like that? There's a shot of Keith and Jimi, from the DVD, and then tons of pictures of the era - onstage at Madison Square Gardens, in a press conference, wandering around town, Mick in a white suite and Keith in jeans n' jacket n' alligator boots comin' down the steps at the Waldorf Astoria, Mick talking to Ike Turner backstage, Mick `n' B.B. King, an onstage shot of Tina Turner in ecstasy, and finally a glorious shot of some hippy with a great leather jacket that unfolds into a sea of tassles.<br /><br />The text of the booklet is better than that ofmost box sets, and has a long essay from Ethan Russell, who went on tour with the Stones and filled book after book of pictures of the band (and is known, by the way, as the only photographer to have shot album covers for The Beatles, The Stones and The Who). The essay is personal and wonderful, but also over the top. \\"The Stones' performances came at the end of an unprecedented ascendance of music's influence over an entire generation. It is probably fair to say that never in the history of America had music played a more important role than our music did for us\\", and \\"certainly, no nation ever had a soundtrack like ours.\\" Bombastic, but not off the mark, I should think. A lot of the book (and the \\"Gimme Shelter\\" movie) is apologetic about the non-appearance of the Stones at Woodstock, and in many ways the band tried to out-do the legacy of the famous concert. They turned away activist Abbie Hoffman, who supposedly coined the term \\"Woodstock Generation\\", when he came demanding alms in New York (pretending to be Colonel Tom ), but they also tried to create a \\"Woodstrock West\\" at Altamont (which failed). Besides that, their July 5th concert in London, just days after the death of Brian Jones, had been the biggest free concert until Woodstock.<br /><br />Russell talks about being invited to join the tour after seeking out the band in LA, where he happened to be, and history was made. It was on this tour that Sam Cutler, for the first time, introduced the band as \\"the Greatest Rock `n' Roll band in the World!\\" Mick, apparently, didn't like the moniker, thought it was \\"over the top\\". The tour drudged on, and the boys never played an encore. But then... New York, and Madison Square Gardens, by which time they'd played 15 shows in 12 cities. Russell conveys interesting points, such as how \\"The Stones, especially Mick, are comfortable amidst the cosmopolitan trappings, always a surprise to me.\\" There are tales of the security entourage, Vietnam vets, and there's also the infamous press conference, seen in Gimme Shelter, where Mick is asked if he's satisfied (\\"Sexually, yes. Financially, unsatisfied. Philosophically, trying.\\") and where he first mentions a free concert that would be Altamont. Some of the anecdotes, such as one about a trip to Baltimore, are boring (typical), but others are good fun. \\"Jagger has just been told that a woman is about to have his baby, and that another woman was about to leave him. This is what's inside him as he goes through the curtain, faces the 16,000 at Madison Square Garden and the band launches into `Jumpin' Jack Flash.' You would never know. \\"John Glynns, the engineer who recorded the show, talks about looking up at the building from outside and seeing it swaying as the band played, from the tremendous crowd response.<br /><br />Russell also went on to tell the story of \\"the album cover that never was\\", describing the early stages of the process of getting the album cover together when many suggestions were shot down - several treasured shots from the live show, a picture of Mick talking to a man of 30 with close cropped hair lighting a cigarette while Mick is dressed up like... Mick. None of them acceptable, probably because the band isn't interested in seeing what they always see when they are on tour. Mick suggests some sort of still life with all of the band's odds `n' ends - a suitcase, a passport, a stars and stripes top hat, a joint. They took tons of pictures, all of them unusable. \\"Didn't you shoot any without the joint?\\" Mick asked.<br /><br />The booklet also reprints Lester Bangs' November 12th, 1970 Rolling Stone Magazine review of the album that starts out talking about how bored he is with bands (Ten Years After, CSNY, CCR, The Band) and music (\\"Standards of performance are very low, and those few artists with enough talent or interest to put on a credible show often end up turning in performances so professionally, predictably competent that you walk tout with the palest satisfaction and few memories.\\"), but you get the sense that until \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\", his view was that the best live album of all time had been \\"Got Live If You Want It\\". Like a lot of Bangs' writing, it is so quotable that it is hard to write about it as such. Basically he spends the first 33% of the piece complaining about the state of music, and the next 66% praising the album (which is why the Stones reproduced it here, surely). \\"More than just the soundtrack for a Rolling Stones concert, it's a truly inspired session, as intimate an experience as sitting in while the Stones jam for sheer joy in the basement. It proves once and for all that this band does not merely play the audience, it plays music whose essential crudeness is so highly refined that it becomes a kind of absolute distillation of raunch, that element which seems to be seeping out of Seventies rock at a disturbing rate.\\" Bangs considers their version of Chuck Berry's \\"Carol\\" better than his, ditto for Joe Cocker's version of \\"Honky Tonk Women.\\" Bangs gets a lot wrong - \\"The Seventies may not have started with bright prospects for the future of rock, and so many hacks are reciting the litany of doom that it's beginning to annoy like that insane survey hit. The form may be in trouble, and we listeners may ourselves be in trouble, so jaded it gets harder each month to even hear what we're listening to.\\" This is him writing about the Seventies!!! What would he have made of this decade, with Rebecca Black's \\"Friday\\" on our minds. But at least he saw a bright future for the Stones. And he was right.<br /><br />Finally, the booklet contains four pages of recollections from five fans. The first one, from Binky Phillips, talks about his adventure in the front row and getting hit on the head by Charlie Watts' flying drumstick. \\"A fan\\", who was 13 at the time, talks about asking Keith to marry her. \\"Talk to me again in a few years,\\" was what he said. Jeez. Tour business manager Ronnie Schneider recollects going with Mick to Harlem to see James Brown play, but he also remembers how the band lacked a business contract with the organisers of the show, a dangerous situation to be in. The organisers were stingeing on the rider, so it looked like they were prepared to fleece the band. Schneider bluffed the organisers that the band were not going to play to the 16,000 impatient, screaming fans, but would walk away and leave them to deal with the rioters; that contract got signed, even though it was a bluff. Wonder if that's how it really went down...<br /><br />The concert is, of course, fantastic. The disc starts off with strange announcements, overlapped, many voices \\"everything seems to be ready, are you ready, are you ready for the next band? We're sorry for the delay, is everybody ready? Haven't been to New York in a long time. Let's hear it for the next band, you're in for a great time, the greatest rock `n' roll band in the world--the Rolling Stones\\" (most of the voices seem to belong to Mick Jagger) coming out of the speakers, with crowd cheers in the background; it is an effective technique for building anticipation of great things to come, and when you hear the opening riffs of \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\"--one of my favourite Stones numbers--you get all of those great things: energy, rhythm, grunts and groans, and that great mindless beat. The band is smoking. Mick starts with some cheeky audience engagement: \\"Oh yeah, thank you kindly. I think I bust a button my trousers, I hope they don't fall down. You don't want my trousers to fall down, now, do you?\\" They quickly go into \\"Carol\\", a relatively unexciting Chuck Berry cover (later on they do \\"Little Queenie\\", a much more invigorating number), and then hit a steaming version of the smutty \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", seemingly an ode to teen sex, with its refrain of \\"But it's no hanging matter/ It's no capital crime.\\" Yee-haw!! After that, things mellow out with Robert Johnson's plaintive \\"Love in Vain\\". There's a brief pause, and that's followed by a hot version of \\"Midnight Rambler\\", with its opening harmonica and Mick grunting, fan response, and ultimately that great, shambling boogie. At 9:04, it is the longest song on the album, and it just raves and raves, with Mick grunting and groaning at the long funk-out, before the song slows down to its \\"well you heard a-bout the Bos-ton\\" stomp, and enormous crowd applause. Can't listen to it once, have to listen to it twice. Between songs you hear the famous crowd drawl \\"paint it black... paint it black, you devils\\" from some anonymous, stoned female fan in the front row (will we ever know who she was? She must get a kick hearing this album); but instead of \\"Paint It Black\\", the crowd gets something much more evil: \\"Sympathy For The Devil.\\" The song heaves and grows in intensity, Mick and the band are having a great time. \\"Live With Me\\" is a dumb rocker; according to the liner notes, Janis Joplin at the concert screamed out \\"you don't have the guts\\", although you can't hear it in the recording. Mick doesn't interact with the crowd much, and it's only on the eight song, \\"Little Queenie\\", that he addresses the audience. \\"Oh New York City, you talk a lot, let's have a lookatcha.\\" The song is a great stomper (nearly every song on the album stomps, of course), and \\"Little Queenie\\" has a lot of tone and drama.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I was still thinkin, hmmmm<br />Well if it's a slow one, We'll omit it<br />If it's a rocker, then we'll get it<br />If it's a good one, she'll admit it<br />C'mon queenie, let's get with it.<br /><br />Oomph! \\"Well all right! Well all right!! Charlie's good tonight,\\" Jagger says, before the band launches into a slow and ground-out \\"Honky Tonk Women,\\" its relatively tepid take is followed by a hot \\"Street Fighting Man\\" that primps and groans.<br /><br />\\"Street Fighting Man\\" is officially the last song of the release, but because this is the box set we are still to be treated to five more tunes from the night, as well as the sets of opening acts B.B. King, and Ike and Tina Turner! First up, the Stones songs: the first one, \\"Prodigal Son\\", starts off with lots of Jagger banter. \\"Thank you very much. We surely gonna dig it. Can you dig it? Yeah, all right. Aw, you sure sound very pretty to us, beautiful voices you got\\", before Keith starts up on the steel guitar and Jagger wallops through the old Robert Wilkins song. \\"Thank you, we're going to do another one like this\\", and then there's \\"You Gotta Move\\", a Mississippi Fred McDowell and Glen Davis song (incidentally, the band also played it on \\"Love You Live\\" from 1977). The band then kicks into \\"Under My Thumb\\", that rascally tune of misogeny that is so loved by all Stones fans, and the song meanders on and on, eventually losing a bit of steam, finally shifting gears into a drawling version of \\"I'm Free,\\" with its funky, bluesy guitar solo. but the band recovers its wallop with \\"I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)\\", sung with gusto by Jagger.<br /><br />BB King jumps into things with \\"Everyday I Have The Blues\\", a spirited opener with blistering guitar and King's cheesy bluesy voice hotting things up. \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" is a mellower song, it is about an evil woman and it is full of jokes, ha ha... \\"That's Wrong Little Mama\\" is a song with full horns and is busy and active, with stop and start music, but B.B. King just going on and on and on. Beautiful sustained guitar tones on the solo. \\"Why I Sing The Blues\\" is fast and funky, with horns, and it's a history of black America. Great, perfect vocal delivery with singing, talking and hollerin', and great sweet guitar. He ends the song, then picks it up again for another round, \\"one more, baby, one more.\\" \\"Please Accept My Love\\" is preceded by a sorta funny/cheezy speech, over B.B. King's guitar pluckings and some lazy drum and piano accompaniment:<br /><br />\\"Thank you ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to dedicate this next number from the group and I, especially to you, thank you, thank you verymuch; and we also would like to dedicate this to the stars of the show, The Stones, because had it not been for them [applause] - thank you, had it not been for them, you would not have heard B.B. King. Thank you. The next number I ask you please, if you will, don't pay much attention to the way I sound trying to sing it, nor the orchestration, nor Lucille; but if you will, please, ladies and gentlemen, if you will just try and pick up on the lyric in this song--because this lyric, I think, can tell you more than I ever could t-trying to stand up and talk to you, and the title of this is \\"Please Accept My Love.\\" Thank you. Thank you very much.\\"<br /><br />Once we've been through that, B.B. King starts off with his beautiful singing, then his passionate hollering, \\"if you let me be your slave/ your love I'll cherish to my grave.\\" Beautiful. Ike and Tina Turner then come out with an all-covers set, starting with a jazzy intro to \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\", before zapping into \\"Sweet Soul Music\\", with Miss Tina Turner blasting the roof off the joint with that throaty roar. \\"Do you like good music, oh sweet soul music?\\" Splendid. That's followed by a truly inspired \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\", just fine how that voice swells and lowers, then explodes with emotion; \\"takin' time to make time.\\" You really feel like she's being wooed by the son of a preacher man and is deep in love/lust. That's followed by a great, rollin' version of \\"Proud Mary\\", hot and horny. Even hornier is \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\", which starts off slow, then builds up as a call and response between Tina and a far-from-the-microphone Ike \\"you got what I want,\\" \\"you got what I need.\\" I want you to give it to me. Tina sounds like she's getting it on right onstage. Here's a video clip of the song, probably from a different night, that's outright pornographic.<br /><br />\\"Sock it... sock it to me babe! Oh baby!! Don't make me stop!!! Oh baby, I don't want to stop now.\\" Need to listen to that more than twice in a row, man. Then there's a version of the Beatles' \\"Come Together\\", which proves that rock `n' roll could still have soul, although it's a bit heavy for the band. The last song is a funky and soulful \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\", which is a great one to take the set out. And what a set!ion and few memories.\\"), but you get the sense that until \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\", his view was that the best live album of all time had been \\"Got Live If You Want It\\".

0553381695|5.0|Other than the Lord of the Rings, I have not read fantasy books.  I think I may be missing out.  Like others, I got turned on the GOT books by the HBO series.  I just finished reading Clash of Kings late last night.  It's one of those books where you don't want to go to sleep because you want to read just one more chapter.  Five hours later, you've lost another night's sleep.  The author's writing style is so smooth that you just lose yourself in the story.  This second book builds on the first book, which was also amazing.  Where Book 1 set up a lot of the characters, Book 2 has a lot more action. The author does an amazing job of making you see each point of view.  While reading the part about the big battle in the book, I couldn't decide which king I supported.  Although King Joffrey is clearly a despicable character and you want him to lose, Tyrion is awesome and you want to root for him, which means you are also rooting for the despicable King Joffrey and the rest of the Lannister clan.  Theon Greyjoy takes an unfortunate path, and you want to hate him, but he's so pathetic and his family has so much contempt for him, that I ended up feeling sorry for him.  As you spend more time with each character, they become more fleshed out.  I can't wait to see what happens to my favorite characters, and I hope they survive Book 3.
B0002B15XI|5.0|The great Robert Altman film, and what an excitement to watch it again. Donald Sutherland is weird with his strange face and his lanky demeanor, Sally Kellerman is absurd as a regular army clown, Tom Skeritt is hard to take without his signature mustache (he seems out of place as a 4077th Swamp wise-ass) and Robert Duvall is a freaky Frank Burns. Best of all is Elliot Gould, the man who brings a jar of olives to Korea for his martinis. I love the classic scene where he drops an olive into a martini glass that is sitting on the ground of his tent. Nice scene when Margaret \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan is getting out of the helicopter, you get a view of her garters, then see her stand up straight to salute the commanding officer, before ducking down in order to not get decapitated by the chopper blades (Sally Kellerman did that stunt herself, by the way). Funny thing about Painless Paul's prick. The scenes in surgery are pure black comedy, with the cast murmuring and adlibbing while there's blood all over the linens. Great dialogue too:<br /><br />  Hawkeye (to Hot Lips, after she's berated him for letting the nurses call him Hawkeye, etc.) Oh come off it, Major. You put me right off my fresh fried lobster, do you realize that? I'm now going to go back to my bed, I'm going to put away the best part of a bottle of scotch... And under normal circumstances, you being normally what I would call a very attractive woman, I would have invited you back to share my little bed with me and you might possibly have come. But you really put me off. I mean you... You're what we call a regular army clown.<br />  Hot Lips: I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a level of responsibility in the medical corps.<br />  Father Mulcahey: He was drafted.<br /><br />Then there's the great scene where Frank and Hot Lips get together<br /><br />  - God meant us to find each other.<br />  - His will be done.<br /><br />Mad necking and groping ensues. Hawkeye corners Frank on the matter, asks \\"Was she better than self abuse?\\" When Frank attacks Hawkeye, Trapper yells out \\"Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye, the man's a sex maniac. I don't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Don't let him kiss you.\\" Classic. The madness of Frank Burns, the pain of Painless Paul agonising of the \\"latent homosexuality\\" that he must expose his three fiancees back home to, the recreation of Michelangelo's Last Supper scene before curing Paul with a faked suicide, it's all aces.<br /><br />The movie goes so quickly through so many classic scenes that you think it's done its job only an hour in. But wait, there's more. The mystery of Hot Lips' hair - is she a real blonde (we can find out in so many ways). Then there's the great harangue \\"This is not a hospital, this is an insane asylum.\\" The Japan scenes are hot, full of insubordinance, mock-bad dialogue, and fantastic irreverence (not to mention the umbrella fencing scene. Nobody spoke authentic Japanese (or Korean, for that matter). The story fills out with a football game, which includes some of the crappiest scenes of the movie, the only ones that are relatively plot-driven. Oh well. It's funny anyway - tokin' on the bench, general chaos, civil war on the field, it's a mini war that doesn't need Korea to produce injuries and lost lives. Funny scenes, like Father Mulcahey praying for the safety of each jeep, or \\"Tokyo Shoeshine Boy\\" coming over the loudspeakers.<br /><br />Then there's also a 20-minute documentary on the first disc, then three documentaries (40 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes) on the second disc. Let's see if I can get to all of them.<br /><br />On the first disc there's an interesting documentary giving the background of the production. It seems like the director took out all references to Korea, even adding rice farmers hats from Vietnam into the crowd in some scenes. The film had a small budget, only $3.5 million, director Robert Altman only took $75,000. Twentieth Century Fox at the time had two other war films, each one more patriotic: \\"Patton\\" and \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\" Altman kepta low profile while filming, and used new actors, or relatively unknown actors. Donald Sutherland had taken a small role in The Dirty Dozen, and Elliott Gould had been in a few pictures. Tom Skerrit had been with Altman in a few projects, the only actor who had previously worked with Altman. There is a great scene with Altman telling Sutherland at a party that the guy he plays calls himself Hawkeye. \\"Hawkeye?\\" the young Canadian asks. The role was good for Sutherland, who was struggling financially at the time, although he and Gould eventually went on to fight Altman with their agents and the studio.

The rift between Altman and Sutherland/Gould unwittingly led them to give great performances. Altman and Burghoff went naked for Sally.

It's not very good, as it shows how nonchalantly they gave an award to Robert Altman (who looks exactly like he did when he was making M*A*S*H*), but it has some interesting lines. Seems like Altman hated the series, thought that it was racist. \\"Everybody's a racist. We're all racists.\\" Apparently Michael Altman only wanted a guitar as payment for his involvement in the movie, but he got a contract after all and probably ended up making more money than his dad did., Tora, Tora.\\" Altman kepta low profile while filming, and used new actors, or relatively unknown actors.

0553801473|3.0|Finally finished reading \\"A Dance with Dragons,\\" by George R.R. Martin. 1016 pages took me 6 weeks to complete. It was good, but after a 6-year gap since \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and an 11-year gap since \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" it is hard to say it was totally worth the wait. At least I can look forward to a more timely HBO production schedule!
1559409002|5.0|Unconventional intro with no credits, jumps right into the action: the drag race down industrial America's early dirt roads, the old bridge, and the spooky music and \\"Carnival of Souls\\" opening title card. Beautiful. Wondrous early scenes of organ-ism with the reverend who looks like Al Gore, and the prophetic words \\"Thank you, but I'm never coming back.\\" On the road, cheerful music turns to spooky organ music, the beautiful driver turns on a light to illuminate herself (something no driver would ever do), and then sees her first scary apparitions. Settlin' in at her new home, then sexxee bath scenes. The scene with the lecherous neighbour in the boarding house is practically scarier than the real fright-scenes. Scary wallpaper. \\"I don't sleep so good as it is.\\" The landlady, a bit of a creep herself, brings up sandwiches for dinner with coffee. \\"Coffee never keeps me awake.\\" And then we see her lying awake. And flirting with the lecherous/dimwitted neighbour. She slips into a negligee for some surreal shopping, and then down an escalator (symbolic) to check out the blissful netherworlds. Wandering around the spooky, deserted Saltair that she's oddly attracted to/repulsed by on a bright afternoon, taking in the amazing old architecture and space--tunnels, boardwalks with shadows coming through slated ceiling, a billboard woman that looks like her, so many beautiful screen captured. Great shadow-in-doorway photography, walking though the long shadows of the old dance floor in disarray and ruin, a solitary old space on the waterfront, Betty Blue with only Betty and no Zorg. Crazy dirge, 1920s dancers, morning turns to night, scary organ music. \\"Your lack of soul.\\"<br /><br />  - I hope she does leave.<br />  - I hope she can.<br /><br />In some ways the film has some really bad acting, terrible dialogue delivery. \\"But my dear... you cannot live in isolation from the human race, you know!\\" But who cares--Candace Hildigloss (what a name!) is stunning in a glamorous 50s girl-next-door sort of way.<br /><br />The amazing Saltair pavilion, which was in disrepair even in 1962 when the film was made, was in many ways the ideal location for a film like this--it had been built in 1893, but had been closed in the late 1950s (even after several resurrections). It is practically the star of the film itself.  Saltair once had the world's largest indoor dance floor, capable of supporting 2,000 dancing couples and two orchestras. The lake receded, then it flooded. Saltair burned to the ground twice.<br /><br />With so many scenes that show parked cars, driving, racing, in-car shots, going into the auto shop, the car is very central to the movie. There some great, spacious interior shots and you really have to wonder how they captured them. Sinister voice says \\"eastbound bus now loading, Gate Nine.\\" Eastbound, like over the river Jordan? \\"Why can't anybody hear me?\\" as she runs through the town. Can hear her own footsteps and the organ, but nothing else, until the birds chirp, and then the nightmare is over. Scary ghost dances with she, herself. Early Goths. She blends with herself at the end. The psychiatrist and the cleric give each other a deep meaningful look.<br /><br />The Criterion Collection version comes in two versions: the 78-minute theatrical release, and an 83-minute director's cutcomes with gorgeous extras:<br /><br />- a 39-minute reel of outtakes<br />- a 28-minute documentary on the film done by a Kansas TV station<br />- a sideshow that included the instructional \\"Saltair: A History of Isolation\\" and \\"Saltair photo gallery.\\" These demonstrate Saltair through the ages, going from a 1892 architectural drawing, through the glory days in the 1920s when it brought in 500,000 people a year, down to the decay of the early 1960s. \\"Three hundred tons of steel girders supported the large dome, which was similar in size and shape to the Mormon Church's Tabernacle on Salt Lake City's Temple Square.\\" After many ups and downs, the place burned to the ground in November, 1970. There is both a timeline-slideshow that includes postcards from all ages of Saltair and a regular slideshow of pictures, mainly of the 1920s heyday, when the lake was full of revellers.<br />- samples of Herk Harvey's Centron Films documentaries \\"Star 34', \\"Centron Commercial\\", \\"Signals: Read `em or Weep\\", \\"To Touch A Child\\", \\"Jamaica, Haiti and the Lesser Antilles\\" and \\"Korea: Overview.\\"<br />- a 4:42 minute documentary from KTWU Channel II called \\"The Carnival Tour\\" that showed where the film was made, which was mainly in Lawrence, Kansas. The intersection at 23rd and Iowa is now the area where the drag race started. Dirt roads have been paved to become Clinton Parkway, and the Lacompton Bridge, where the car dropped into the Iowa river, has been rebuilt.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|By far one of the best! Throughout the book I had either a lump in my throat, tears in my eyes or a ache in my heart. A must read.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The music is very much like classical music, and with the opening sequences we get an underwater symphony of light and sound, a Ghibli Nemo but with strange boats, creatures, and magicians. Nice just-under-the-water scenes, where the surface gloats suspended above us like a sun-glowing tent. The main villain/father figure looks like Alice Cooper, but he speaks Japanese, of course. The little five-year-old Sosuke is a sweet little boy, and he loves Ponyo, the little goldfish he finds. His mom, Misa, drives along mountainous roads such as you'd see in Amalfi in Italy quite a lot like Lupin did in the Castle of Cagliostro, or like the raiders to in Laputa, both Studio Ghibli films directed by Miyazaki Hayao, the director of this film. There are great scenes of wind and sea power, and our modern world is dwarfed by the spirit of nature (of course). The story get a little strange, when we learn that this little goldfish could set the entire balance of nature a-kilter, and cause the moon to collide with the earth (?!?!), but this is not all that important to the story, and it's more about the love between Sosuke and our little magickal childe, Ponyo. The scenes show Ponyo discovering ham, instant noodles, shortwave radio, power generators and honey tea. The film coughs up words like \\"Devonian Sea\\", which apparently is a geological period and system of the Paleozoic Era, spanning from 416-359 million years ago when the pectoral and pelvic fins of lobe-finned fish evolved into legs as they started to walk on land as tetrapods and had names like Cycloptopus and Devonychus. Go figure! One of the best parts of the story is an encounter with Ponyo's mother, a monstrous (and monstrously beautiful) sea spirit who is bliss personified. The story is fun and touching, and at the end one father says goodbye to go back to his home in the sea while another returns to his home from the sea.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout DVD. I've only been doing it for 2 weeks, but I've already recommended it to a lot of my friends. I lost 2.2 lbs in my first ten days of following this workout routine. I'm on Level 2 now and a bit more challenged, but I'm working at it to get better and better. Jillian is a great instructor and she even tells you exactly what she doesn't want you to do on certain excercises. This is exactly what I've been looking for to add to my workout collection! :-)
B002ZG99QS|2.0|While I'm not a fanboy for Tron, I thought that this would be fun, or at least not an embarrassing father-son movie like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull; I was right about the latter (barely), but wrong about the former. The movie made no sense at all, and was ultimately terribly stupid. Kind of like Speed Racer, or something, but without the over-the-top CG.
0394806220|5.0|Like almost all of the Dr. Seuss books we own, this is a very cute book and great for reading aloud. The rhymes are nice and it's fun listening to my daughter try to imitate all of the different sounds from the book.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|A difficult follow-up to the Grammy award-winning \\"Raising Sand\\" (and Plant and Krauss apparently did try to make \\"Raising Sand II\\"), this time around we see Plant releasing yet another covers album - he only has writing credits on one song, besides a few where he credits himself for \\"arrangement.\\" The album is somewhat uninspiring, although the two Low covers (\\"Silver Rider\\" and \\"Monkey\\") are brilliant (and you wonder what they would have sounded with Krauss, although Patty Griffin does a great job.<br /><br />\\"Angel Dance\\" is a fun rocker, while the Richard Thompson cover \\"House of Cards\\" slows things down somewhat, with sassy backing vocals. \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\" is a rustic ole banjo-pickin' bluegrasser, with old man baritone keeping it warm on the porch of the ole shack on the hilltop. Yup. \\"Silver Rider\\" is the longest song on the album, and in many ways a standout. There is a loud, grungy riffage, and the song is a stunning duet that needs to be blasted. Plant was born to sing this song, one of his top 10 solo works. It's slow and trudging, slower and more trudging perhaps than even the original song by Low, from \\"The Great Destroyer\\" release, as Plant's is over one minute longer; the Low version also has louder vocal harmonies (which Plant replaces with crunchy guitars - nice). \\"You Can't Buy My Love\\" is a spirited old rocker, and \\"Falling In Love Again\\" is a gloomy crooner. \\"The Only Sound That Matters\\" is a beautiful ballad with slide guitar, it sounds great and groovy. \\"Monkey\\" is a beautiful version of the Low song, with great swooning guitars. Low's version goes for bombast, getting away from the mellower than death sound, while Plant's version keeps it sombre.<br /><br />Plant follows up the haunting \\"Monkey\\" with the hokey \\"Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday\\", a song that Nick Cave has also covered. Plant does it bluegrass, and it builds up slowly in intensity. Then there's another Townes Van Zandt, his second in two albums, \\"Harm's Swift Way\\". This is reportedly the last song ol' Townes ever wrote, and Plant gives it a jazzy rendition, a bit different than Townes probably would have done it. \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" is a traditional, done in a very spooky and swampy ole way, it is another of the album's standout tracks. Groovy. Last song on the album is \\"Even This Shall Pass Away\\", a spare tune that just has Plant's voice with some percussion, and then, later, some weird bass groanings. Pretty fun and funky electronic moaning closer.song ol' Townes ever wrote, and Plant gives it a jazzy rendition, a bit different than Townes probably would have done it. \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" is a traditional, done in a very spooky and swampy ole way, it is another of the album's standout tracks.

B00008GKEG|5.0|Great opening montage - the four men are dwarfed by the name \\"THE BEATLES\\" coming down like something from Tron. Four minutes into the story, which opens with \\"In My Life\\" and a montage of photos, we get the first words of the story. Birth words, then zeitgeist with the four guys talking about their influences, and how they would listen to whatever was on the radio at the time because nobody had any money and they had to take what they could get. The music that was on hand was \\"Rocket 88', Elvis' \\"That's alright Mama\\", \\"Ain't That A Shame. Ringo is hardly quoted here, and the songs aren't adequately subtitled. Paul notes that when he heard Elvis, he thought \\"that's the guru we've been waiting for - the messiah has arrived.\\" References to Big Bill Brunsey, I have to look him up, and the song he sang, \\"These Earthly Things.\\" In those early Liverpool days, Paul and George took a bus to learn their third chord, the B7 (after the A and the E). Paul describes his first meeting with John, how they met at a Quarrymen gig, but how John was impressed that Paul could remember the lyrics, in particular \\"25 Rock\\" by Eddie Cochrane. Paul gives a demo of this song in the documentary, and he could still sing the lyrics. The band's first recording is \\"In Spite Of All The Danger\\", a nice little thing. Descriptions of The Jacaranda, which still looks like a club the year they did the documentary. Funny how the band would show up with three guitarists, and the guy would say \\"okay, so where's the drummer then.\\" Lots of scamming going on. There's a 1960s live recording with Stuart Sutcliffe (only one? they played together for sooooo many shows). In Liverpool in 1960, Pete Best was known as \\"mean, moody and magnificent.\\", and he replaced Paul as a drummer - they auditioned him one day, then jumped on a bus for Hamburg to do their first gigs. Rory Storm came to Hamburg with Ringo, and they had first class treatment by sleeping five to a room, much better than what the Beatles had. Paul and Pete were busted for burning a condom against a wall and deported to Liverpool, then they were back in Hamburg for their second stint. Later, there was dissatisfaction with Pete Best, and Ringo sat in for their sessions in Hamburg from time to time. He was mature, bearded, and owned a Zephyr Zodiac. \\"That was probably a knock-off, or fell off the back of... a showroom\\" Paul explains (ha ha). As the band was coming together, they left Hamburg and lost Stuart Sutcliffe as a bassist; neither John nor George wanted to play bass, so Paul obliged. There was an audition for Decca on January 1st, 1962, which Paul says \\"it's not great, but it's good.\\" Decca boss Dick Rowe didn't sign them claiming that \\"guitar groups are on their way out.\\" They hawked the Decca tape to Parlaphone and EMI and did \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"Please Please Me\\", and this is where Part 1 ends. Hooray.<br /><br />Part 2 is very much about music. I am now noticing that this documentary doesn't have a narrator and is assembled completely out of interviews with participants in the Beatles story, archival footage, and montages while music that has no accompanying video is played. This one opens with the post-Hamburg era when they are in Liverpool and trying a tour of the UK, playing in London, achieving fame in Liverpool but with no LP released. While snippets from their early sessions is played, the camera roves all over rare photos and posters of the Beatles from the era. The effect is spooky, but also a bit cold. Even colder is later on, when the camera roves around a drumkit, two guitars and a bass player setup, all humans are absent as we listen to John, Paul, George and Ringo record their first album and engage in session banter. Sure, the vintage equipment is interesting to gawk at, but it imparts a sense of loneliness. The boys tell of a tour they did with English artists, as well as people like Roy Orbison. They would hear Roy writing another great song at the back of the tour bus (a little somethingcalled \\"Pretty Woman\\"), and felt that they had to try their hardest to keep up. The birth of the competitive songwriting spirit. With time, the boys became swinging Londoners, with Ringo and George renting a room for 45 quid a week (a fortune in those days). The money was coming in and the boys were eating well for the first time in many year (or ever). They were close to the Rolling Stones, gave them \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" before they even recorded it themselves.  There is some live material that looks great but suffers from bad sound for \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" (Paul's lead vocals are drowned out by John's backing vocals, George's guitar can't be heard. In the pre-Command Performance we see some jerk poking the back of Paul's head while he's talking to the camera. There's a shot of the Queen Mother, who seems to be waving to the band. Funny memories of their tour to France, when it was the boys who were screaming for the Beatles and not the girls. Then there's the moment when they get the word that they finally had a hit in the US and it had gone to number 1. That must have been their biggest moment up until then. Part 2 ends with the boys landing up on US shores and experiencing Beatlemania overseas.<br /><br />Part 3 picks up with EMI letting Capital have the Beatles in the US if they promise to spend $70,000 to promote them. The boys aspired to be in a movie like \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\", a Jayne Mansfield film that had performances from Little Richard, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. Describes the trip to Hong Kong, where there were lots of Brits and no Hong Kongers. Got to Sydney with capes that they had bought in Hong Kong, it rained and the blue colour in the capes ran. Kids who had waited 24 hours were disappointed, but later all of Australia turned out to see them, a sea of people. The UK's Marx Brothers in \\"Hard Day's Night\\", the boys gong crazy. Girls passing out in the crowd. USA tour collage. They met Little Richard (in Hamburg the first time, but again in the US), Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Fats Domino with his diamond star watch. Bob Dylan. Paul found the meaning of life the night he met Bob Dylan. \\"There are seven levels. I laughed and I laughed and I laughed. It was fabulous.\\" Ringo almost killed in Montreal by anti-Semites?!?  People would wheel out cripples, hoping to have them healed by the Beatles. Opportunism. Only peace was in the loo. John's spastic act explained, pretty crappy. They played 32 shows in 34 days in 24 cities. George Martin - John was the first example of feedback on record, and it was an accident. Paul sometimes at left of stage, sometimes at right. Ringo drum cigarettes. Help! movie, Bahamas, skis, great studio videos. Paul at the tugboat talking about all this. MJ for breakfast. Ringo's crazy phrases came up as \\"Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" Describing the writing of \\"Yesterday\\":<br /><br />  Paul: I had a piano by my bed/ And woke one morning with this tune in my head.<br />  George: And so, for Paul McCartney of Liverpool England, opportunity knocks.<br />  John: Thank you, Ringo, that was wonderful.<br /><br />George noted that \\"Sinatra still refers to `Something' as his favourite Lennon-McCartney song. Thank, Frank.\\" Then, scandal coverage: The MBE Debased!!<br /><br />Anthology 5 starts up at Shea Stadium, which was packed with 56,000 people. \\"At least we're not taking it seriously.\\" John cracked up, played the \\"I'm Down\\" organ. John, George and Ringo talk about meeting Elvis. \\"They used us as an excuse to go mad, then they blamed us.\\" Paul interviewed about it in front of one of his stages.<br /><br />In Part 6, they talk about the mess of playing in the Philippines and how they feared for their lives, they are still very resentful. It was shown on TV how they had not arrived at the presidential palace. Years later, they were finally seen as hip for standing up to Ferdinand and Imelda. Paul sings solo acoustic \\"Elenor Rigby.\\" When the \\"bigger than Jesus controversy came out,\\" they get a guy from the KKK talking on TV about the Beatles concert in town, making veiled threats. Desperate CBS reporter went around New York tying to find anyone who disliked the Beatles as a result of the whole kerfuffle, finally found a 10-year-old kid who was the only one who admitted that he liked another group better than the Beatles (Herman and his Hermits). They were feeling danger on tour, getting death threats, etc. Too much Elenor Rigby in soundtrack. Music: \\"It has been a hobby. It still is.\\" Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band started out as a concept album, but they only got one or two songs on the concept, then they went back to making a regular album. \\"It was 20 years ago today,\\" I remember seeing a documentary on 1987 when it was 20 years after the release, now it's nearly 45 years since the release... Jagger at the \\"Day in the Life\\" sessions with Marianne Faithfull, the orchestra with the funny glasses and fake noses footage. Animated bits from the cover are interesting, then the colouring. Jimi Hendrix opened a London concert with the title track two days after it was released. Ringo learned how to play chess during the recording because there was so much studio tomfoolery. (My son Zen told me that George Harrison looks like Severus Snape, or Doctor Octopus). Julian Lennon in Greece with John, they all do a Greek circle dance on an exclusive island. Nice.<br /><br />Anthology 7, we get a full glimpse of George's hairy monobrow. \\"You can't go to Harrod's to get a mantra.\\" Defending Magical Mystery Tour, which Paul stepped in to direct, but it was awful. The Beatles used a lot of video after they stopped touring, because they wanted to get messages out to their fans without putting their lives at risk by going on the road. \\"Hello Goodbye\\", John does an Elvis point `n' pose. Beatles waring 1962 uniforms in 1967. Three Beatles in the park, George on ukelele. George played some of the many songs he wrote at the time in India that he's never recorded, such as \\"Derry Doo.\\"<br /><br />Anthology 8 starts with The White Album, which they recorded with three studios going at the same time. \\"The moment you need is on your shoulder.\\" Paul at the camp fire talking about the Beatles. George's floppy hat and sheep boots walking around London. Everyone happy to have Billy Preston around because the pressure came off. Ringo shown in great lime green suit with frilly lime collar. People on the street nearby hearing the band come out to figure out what is happening, the band plays a rooftop concert, the police come out and try to bust them, politely, as the cameras roll. John's nonsense singing for some of the verses. Long footage of rooftop concert. John sits on the floor in some sessions. \\"An intimate bioscopic experience with the Beatles.\\" \\"Something\\" video with the four Beatles wives.huck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Fats Domino with his diamond star watch. Bob Dylan. Paul found the meaning of life the night he met Bob Dylan. \\"There are seven levels. I laughed and I laughed and I laughed.

It still is.\\" Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band started out as a concept album, but they only got one or two songs on the concept, then they went back to making a regular album. \\"It was 20 years ago today,\\" I remember seeing a documentary on 1987 when it was 20 years after the release, now it's nearly 45 years since the release... Jagger at the \\"Day in the Life\\" sessions with Marianne Faithfull, the orchestra with the funny glasses and fake noses footage. Animated bits from the cover are interesting, then the colouring. Jimi Hendrix opened a London concert with the title track two days after it was released. Ringo learned how to play chess during the recording because there was so much studio tomfoolery. (My son Zen told me that George Harrison looks like Severus Snape, or Doctor Octopus). Julian Lennon in Greece with John, they all do a Greek circle dance on an exclusive island. Nice.    Anthology 7, we get a full glimpse of George's hairy monobrow. \\"You can't go to Harrod's to get a mantra.\\" Defending Magical Mystery Tour, which Paul stepped in to direct, but it was awful. The Beatles used a lot of video after they stopped touring, because they wanted to get messages out to their fans without putting their lives at risk by going on the road. \\"Hello Goodbye\\", John does an Elvis point `n' pose. Beatles waring 1962 uniforms in 1967. Three Beatles in the park, George on ukelele. George played some of the many songs he wrote at the time in India that he's never recorded, such as \\"Derry Doo.\\"    Anthology8 starts with The White Album, which they recorded with three studios going at the same time. \\"The moment you need is on your shoulder.\\" Paul at the camp fire talking about the Beatles. George's floppy hat and sheep boots walking around London. Everyone happy to have Billy Preston around because the pressure came off. Ringo shown in great lime green suit with frilly lime collar. People on the street nearby hearing the band come out to figure out what is happening, the band plays a rooftop concert, the police come out and try to bust them, politely, as the cameras roll. John's nonsense singing for some of the verses. Long footage of rooftop concert. John sits on the floor in some sessions. \\"An intimate bioscopic experience with the Beatles.\\" \\"Something\\" video with the four Beatles wives.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|Great movie, better than the 2nd one! Bought a used copy and had no skipping/scratching problems with it. Shipping was fast also
B004BLJQOK|5.0|One of the best movies I saw last year was \\"Let The Right One In\\", a Norwegian vampire movie that was bleak and arty and basically about the morally ambiguous relationship between two twelve-year-old kids. I walked into this one five minutes late, which I normally don't do, but I thought it would be okay because the credits usually eat up five minutes anyway. But in this case, the movie had started already, at a scene that I knew was halfway through the film. I thought to myself \\"did I come in one hour and five minutes late instead of just five minutes late?\\" But what the director does is he starts at an important scene from the middle, then jumps back two weeks.<br /><br />The film is a very faithful remake of the original, and it's always interesting to see how the director's going to stage any given scene. The one thing that is very different is that neither of Owen's divorcing parents are ever seen; the father is only heard on the phone, and the mum, who he lives with, is only seen from the shoulders down, heightening the sense of Owen's isolation and loneliness. No adult befriends Owen, and his classmates are either indifferent or hostile. Owen's moral lapse comes out strongly in this film, and he's so happy to finally have a companion that he forgets that Abby is a heartless killer.<br /><br />One complaint is the soundtrack, which is too moody, and when it turns moody it projects that something bad is going to happen. I don't remember much music in the original at all. But since its intention is to make the viewers tense, it sure does its job well.<br /><br />Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, the young boy who was in The Road, and he was 13 at the time it was filmed. Abby is played by Chloë Grace Moretz, who was Hit Girl in the movie Kick Ass, and she was also 13 when the film was made. Both actors have been working since 2005 and have been in a bunch of films!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Still the gold standard for the new model of arcade gaming: easy to understand, cute, smooth graphics, earwiggy music, touch control, and free on Android because of the ad banners (but still works in airplane mode, unlike some). If you haven't played this yet... why on earth not?!
B00002SWEM|3.0|I only watched part of this, as it seemed to be mostly about the recordings.  It is a piece of history, and some of the musicians in the film have died. I want to watch it again when I am more in the mood for this kind of music; all I have in my head these days is Black Sabbath, and the two don't blend.  But the idea of discovering a Cuban Nat King Cole is just incredible to me, and you can see and hear it right there. Amazing.  The scenes of the city are just great.  I want to go to Cuba some day. The intro with the photographer showing off some of his best pictures (Fidel Castro at the Lincoln Memorial, which was called \\"David and Goliath\\" is just great propaganda) is just fantastic documentary-making.
B001F6TXME|5.0|It works just the way it should. I'm happy with the item.    I recently attended a Feast of Lanterns ceremony and it worked perfectly to photograph the fireworks display. I was able to keep the shutter on my camera open and capture multiple bursts in one image.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|\\"The sword is the mind. If the sword is right, the mind is right.\\" Robert Mitchum is an old GI who spent time in Tokyo, an old army buddy calls him up on a favour, to help him out of trouble with the yakuza, and they head to Tokyo together to look up a guy they knew who was a yakuza big shot (played by a young Takakura Ken in his second English-speaking role), as well as a girl, the yakuza's sister, who he was living with who wouldn't marry him. Long meaningful looks upon re-encounters. Great kendo hall sword dance. Takakura Ken attacks gangsters with a bicycle. The movie is full of great scenes, like when Mitchum gets out of an elevator, helps a woman who has fallen with her groceries, then goes to exact vengeance on the man who's betrayed him. Ken-san takes down his own nephew (against the specific request of his brother, still a top yakuza), next to a calligraphy of the word \\"kotobuki\\", which means \\"life\\". Ken's back tattoo is exposed during the final duel, it is a glorious '''' (the one of the Five Wisdom Kings of the Shingon tradition of Vajrayana Buddhism known in India as Acala, 'calan'tha, 'ry'calan'tha, 'cala-vidy'-r'ja or Ca''amah'ro'a'a). The revenge tale is beautiful and tragic, and in the end quite pointless. The men at the end uphold their dignity, they solve problems, but they also share tragic losses. The film is all about the idea that \\"I have an obligation to you I can never repay.\\"<br /><br />The film is accompanied by commentary from director Sydney Pollack, who compares Takakura Ken to Paul Newman and Steve McQueen and says things like \\"The Japanese are preoccupied with detail in every aspect of life.\\" He notes that every Yakuza film shows someone getting out of jail, there's always a cemetary scene, and he does this in his movie too too (sorta). He notes that Robert Mitchum has \\"an extraordinary face marinated by life.\\" Kishi Keiko had lived in Paris, had married a friench director Yves Champs. Pollack stole Tokyo walking scenes by filming Mitchum walking with the camera in a car driving by. The film has lines like \\"farmers may watch TV from their tatami mats and you can't see Fuji through the fog, but don't let that fool you, the Japanese are still Japanese.\\" Music is by a jazz musician who was well known in Japan. Takakura Ken couldn't speak English, but learned it phonetically for the film. According to Pollack, Takakura Ken still sends a Christmas card to him every year, and he gave Pollack a 13th-century katana.ing with the camera in a car driving by.

6305882592|5.0|A dark comedy about a young man obsessed with death and funeals (Harold, played by Bud Cort) and an elderly holocaust survivor free spirit who teaches him the meaning of life (and death). Harold is a phony, but Maude is the real thing, and she acts circles around him. Even her make-up is better, as Cort's blanche is a bit obvious. At least his acting comes alive (no pun intended) at the end of the film. Great Cat Stevens songs throughout. Ruth Gordon, who was supposed to be 79 years old (she \\"turns\\" 80 in the film), was 75 at the time, But Cort was 23.
0307946711|1.0|If you enjoy reading books that have a happy ending, then don't read this book.  I was thoroughly enjoying it until a pivotal part comes out of no where and then I was left to continue reading several more chapters just to be able to finish it.  It had some serious themes, but it was also funny and enjoyable and quick.  And then out of nowhere I felt like I was slapped in the face.  Absolutely hated the ending.  If someone had warned me then I wouldn't have read it.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|A truly frightening film, I just didn't know in what way. Of course, it's really all about the moral ambiguity of Sean Penn, which we see in every single scene of the film (although we don't know it at the time). Tim Robbins is fantastic as the mortally screwed-up Dave, who was kidnapped as a child by child molesters under the eyes of his two friends. As adults, their lives intersect over the murder of Penn's daughter. Nothing is as it seems, and the unravelling of the story is fascinating. Unfortunately, there's a superfluous sub-plot over Kevin Bacon's estranged wife, who has escaped to New York to give birth anonymously to their child. While it seems superfluous, it may also serve to display that Bacon's character, while he has his problems, got off the lightest of the three.<br /><br />The film was made in Boston, so it has a \\"The Departed\\" feel to it somehow. I have been to Boston, but I didn't get a feeling like this about the place. I should ask my friends from there how the fims rate.
1444710338|2.0|I have enjoyed the book except it is the UK version. I didn't know that this was Amazon UK until I got the shipping conformation. At this time it was to late to change. Now this leads to the problem that most of the recipes are in metric measures, and a lot of the ingredients are french. Some of these are not available in the US. I have talked to another person that has the US version, they say the measures have been converted to lbs and ounces. Also ingredients have been substiuted to ones available in the US. As it stands now my only solution is to buy the US version! Here again return postage and any sther charges make it more costly to return than just to buy the correct version.
B00004YZFR|5.0|I finally get to see the great film. Starts off with Charlie Watts and the photo shoot for the cover of \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\", with Mick Jagger. Then the band is doing \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" in New York. Then footage of the guys watching the footage, then Altamont soundfiles play, including Hells Angels honcho Sonny Berger on the phone. Mick is visibly upset, Charlie first bemused, then serious. In live shots, we get to look over Jagger's shoulder at the audience and look at the sea of people, some of them you can see in vivid detail amazing. Funny press conference slag:<br /><br />  - Are you any more satisfied now than you were before?<br />  - You mean sexually or philosophically?<br />  - I mean both.<br />  - Well, we're definitely more satisfied now sexually...\\"<br /><br />Teleconference with lawyer to get Altamont concert going. Funky dandy clothes on the Stones, old cars riding around Alabama. \\"Keep Alabama fitter, fight litter\\" on billboard near the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio where they record \\"Wild Horses.\\" Mick with white suit, red scarf, red hat. First the band listens to \\"Wild Horses\\", Keith is singing along. Charlie's bloodied face looks at the camera uncomfortable, Mick claps. Cut to the helicopter taking the band (minus Bill Wyman) out to Altamont (or Al-ta-mon-tay as some local announcers called it). Great slow-mo and multiple images on Jagger as he sings \\"Love In Vain\\", Keith's wearing a funky red and black Marilyn shirt. Lawyer scenes. Tina Turner, with her snake tongue, singing a very passionate \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" at the Madison Square Gardens show as she jerks off mic and mic stand (an extended scene that you can find on YouTube is positively X-rated).<br /><br />The band was so young - Will Wyman was the only geezer at 36, Charlie Watts was 29, Mick and Keith were 26, Mick Taylor was only 20! Mick's skinny chest and cross is so Mick, \\"It's nice to have a chick occasionally,\\" says a disgruntled Mick about Tina. Pretty girls run onstage. \\"I think I lost a button on my trousers, I hope they don't fall down,\\" he taunts, flirting with the audience - many probably hoped that they would fall down. Can see faces in audience during \\"Street Fighting Man.\\" Shows Altamont setup and fires. Afternoon helicopter out to Altamont on December 6th, 1969, cars, crowds, hippies, bad acid trips, white lady raising money for the Panthers, topless hippy chick with big breasts, and some audience fights and freakouts, a topless guy crowd surfing. First baby born, fat naked white lady wandering through the crowd, medical kit. Fat naked Mexican guy appears many times throughout. Frisbees, cool chicks with bubbles in sunset, happenin', man. The Hells Angels show up mid-afternoon and hang out on their beer bus watching the crowd. Middle-aged couples, dogs, cool crowd, hippy chicks, topless chicks, purple-suited black man. Santana played first, then Jefferson Airplane (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young had played that day too, but are not in the film; the Grateful Dead were supposed to play too, but when they saw the madness they refused to go on). Jerry Garcia and Paul Cantor complained that the vibe is really weird. No Stones are seen at all from 48:00 to 1:08:00. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" is interrupted by a Hells Angels freakout in the audience. Dancing fat Hells Angel with a red bandana. Dog walks across the stage. Lots of girls with roses, Mick spazzes at the audience, a Hells Angel with sombrero hat has a word with Mick - what is discussed? People giving each other head shakes, like they know something bad is happening, a wet-eyed girl. Mick admits he can't see what's happening. Meredith Hunter is seen in the crowd at 1:18:48, then they start with \\"Under My Thumb,\\" more sick looks. \\"I pray that it's all right.\\" Stabbed in a second. Crochetted dress girl was with Meredith Hunter, she's seen crying. Off the Stones go in a helicopter, end of the Stones' screening, dark looks. \\"All right, see you all,\\" freeze frame. Brilliant. Closing credits with \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and afternoon setup scenes.<br /><br />The DVD has lots of extras, including 22 minutes of outtakes, first showing bored Stones, Keith doesn't want the camera in his face. Full version of a song with full audio and some video, \\"Little Queeny\\", the only full song on the whole DVD. Hanging out backstage with Ike and Tina Turner, Ike is playing guitar while Tina checks out a catalogue. Keith is showin' off guitar rifs to Ike. It was November, 1969. There is a full set of Bill Owens pics, showing Hells Angels at the mic, crowd shots, Hare Krishnas, a girl on the road with a long shadow. Beth Sunflower pics show the fat naked guy, the gob onstage. There are also trailers of the Maysles Brothers' films - three trailers for \\"Gimme Shelter\\", one for \\"Salesman\\" (the cutthroat \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\"-like world of bible salesmen) and \\"Grey Gardens\\", the tale of faded money and a crumbling mansion. There's a demo of the restoration, both video and sound. Finally, there's 90 minutes of sound from a KSAN radio special that was on the air one day after the Altamont Speedway Rolling Stones free concert disaster. First up is a Tower Records ad, pitching the newly-released \\"Let It Bleed\\" for $2.77. Tales of bad trips and freakouts, it was really heavy, man, many bad trips, bad vibrations, really something going on right from the start, even before Santana began. Woodstock was the point of reference. The Speedway was in a hot alley, everyone was in a hurry to re-create Woodstock for the west coast. The way the stage was constructed. \\"What's the difference between Mick Jagger and Judy Garland?\\" When we say we'll do something, we do it. Committed. Sam Cutler, the road manager, complained that there were 15 people left behind afterwards to clean up 15 tons of garbage, the stage, and the scaffolding. Sonny Barger, Hells Angels chapter head, told his story. There was a fire on. He told Mick to get people to sit down. \\"I've been hurt before and I've been hurt by experts, but over the years I've learned how to get up and do it again.\\"<br /><br />The movie has a commentary from the filmmakers. The directors were Albert and David Maysles, but the younger of the two, David, died in 1987, so the commentators are Albert, as well as editor and co-director Charlotte Zwerin. The Stones broguht the Maysles, who were in their late 30s/early 40s at the time, one day before the Madison Square Gardens gig, which they filmed. The Rolling Stones didn't want a film, they wanted to be filmed, and they have many unedited films on their shelves. Charlie Watts has a big role in the start of this film, bigger character than usual. The flimmakers discuss the use of facial expressions and the focus on the Stones' faces throughout this film, as well as audience faces and expressions, of happiness and agony. There are moments of silence when the camera is on a face you get into the mind of someone, it's a very special privilege. Anecdote of snow having fallen on the film rolls overnight. The 1969 tour happened just after Brian Jones died, this was Mick's liberation and coming out from under Brian's shadow. Nice shots of Keith's crazy transparent plexi guitar.<br /><br />The Maysles got a lot of money up front and half of the profits, but they also had to put $500,000 of their own money into it. For six months afterwards the Stones still hadn't signed the release for the film, but they didn't get the release (and they needed the release for the venture to become profitable) until a friend who knew Mick from the \\"Performance\\" movie intervened. Jimi Hendrix and BB King were there at the Madison Square Gardens backstage room. Charlotte notes her amazement that Tina Turner's sexual innuendo wasn't removed by censors. \\"They must have been dense.\\" Notes about Mel Bella's cathedral-sized office, which was asurdly baroque an crammed with things like parrot cages, the king of torts who knew about publicity. Commentary is made about all the cameramen, but not George Lucas, who was there on one of his early assignments. Before the concert started they saw a fence being torn down, Keith remarked \\"First act of violence,\\" that stuck them as very smart. Explained logistics problems, such as getting sound to sync up with video, or of the generator at Altamont slowing down the speed of filming. Hells Angels were good to the filmmakers on the site, carrying heavy bags. The gang had a place at concerts in California, typically keeping order around the equipment area. Many of the Angels there that day were pledges who had to prove themselves. They wanted also to film the Hells Angels watching the movie, it became an ugly scene where they demanded that the film be destroyed, they demanded $1 million for their scenes in the movie, and they said that if it was released there would be a contract out on their lives, they also wanted to beat up the guys right there in the Hells Angels chapter house. Ugly scene. They also said that after the concert, people who were too stoned to go home or who wanted to party some more, tried to hang out with the Hells Angels at their party fire, and there were more beatings. \\"It's the true story that Woodstock wasn't.\\"<br /><br />The DVD also comes with a 44-page booklet that includes essays by Village Voice film critic Amy Taubin, Stanley Booth, who wrote The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones about his travels with the Stones, Mick Jagger's personal assistant from 1967 to 1972 Georgia \\"Jo\\" Bergman, musician and author Michael Lydon, a short piece by Ralph \\"Sonny\\" Barger himself that is excerpted from Barger's book Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club, and the final piece is by New York Press film editor Godfrey Cheshire.

1451629184|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading A Stolen Life: A Memoir by Jaycee Dugard because of the subject matter. I was saddened of the horrible acts that were done to this child. However, after reading this book I was inspired and realized how truly blessed my life has been. Jaycee is a powerful but tender person that went through terror but found hope through it all. I recommend this book to everyone because it will make you think about your life and how not to give up on anything. Jaycee believed in her heart that her life will not be in vain.

1400063515|3.0|After reading the Black Swan I'm not really sure what just happened. At first I wasn't sure I was going to get through the whole thing. The prose is very different for a non-fiction-science-and-probability book. At least not what I was expecting. The book has small parts of memoir woven throughout, some of which seem to fit, others seem like filler, and others yet are probably over my head and just add to the confusion.<br /><br />In the 3rd chapter Taleb tells a story about an obscure, unpublished novelist Yevgenia Krasnova and how the success of her novel was a highly improbable event&mdash;a Black Swan. Not having heard of this unique success story I put down my book and went to Amazon for more info. After a few minutes of unsuccessful searching in circles I kept reading only to find a footnote at the beginning of Chapter 3 telling me that Yevgenia is fictional.<br /><br />This didn't sit well with me, especially because my internet search behaviour was predicted and footnoted on the very next page. I began to wonder what other sorts of liberties Taleb was going to take but I kept going because I didn't want to be the type of 'Sucker' Taleb talks about. (Yevgenia's character comes up again and I'm curious how purely fictional or perhaps partially autobiographical her character is.)<br /><br />Taleb is clearly a very well read and studied man and is not shy about letting you know it.

B0053Q9DQI|1.0|I have read the novel many times and have watched every film version of Jane Eyre. This is the worst of the lot. This is one of the greatest love stories written. And yet this film version shows no emotion. I felt no passion between Jane and Rochester. These actors said their lines with no feeling. And to make matters worse someone changed the ending of the story.  Do Not waste any money on this film.
B004G600A4|5.0|This Movie is definitely going to be added to my Disney collection !!<br />It's cute and funny !<br />I think Mandy Moore did a Spectacular Job !! She is a very good Actress !!!<br />I give it 10 thumbs up !!<br />Any little girl would really like this !<br />I love the Horse and the little Chameleon ! Both funny animals ! :c)<br /><br />I think this movie is GREAT !!!
0316044695|4.0|Good book. Lets face it, SEALS are the best at what they do, so if the book comes off sounding \\"cocky\\", well I think they've earned the right to think the way they do.  The story is good and although tradgic, I felt a sencse of pride knowing that we have good AMERICANS doing the Lords work and fighting for us.       We all go through small struggles in life and we all have our mountains to climb, I know I can personally think of numerous training excersises for work, where you wonder why the hell am I doing this and they're just wanting to see me suffer, but this book shows you that all those test in life, set you up and prepare you for that one time in your life, if you ever find yourself in a do or die situation, that you can make it and live through it.    The book reads fast, I had a hard time putting it down.
B000JIHP88|4.0|This is a fantastic mobile, I am so glad we registered for it. It matches the soother, play gym and jumperoo we got. We are pleased with all these rainforest items because our baby loves them. This mobile keeps her attention. There are several classical music  choices and nature sounds. I like the remote control feature because I can switch it on from my bed. I wish it projected light on the ceiling like others do, because then we would be able to use it longer and our baby loves lights. It can be used as a music box and night light when she gets too big, but it would be nicer if it projected light to the ceiling. All in all, we are very happy with this.
0553573403|5.0|This book/series is Awesome!! It's hard to put down.  I read 115+ pages the first time I opened it!<br />Unfortunately, I saw the entire first season of the HBO series before reading this; but it doesn't really ruin it for the reader.  The book gives more history of the Seven Kingdoms & Extreme depth to each character, which is what I was looking for now that the HBO series has ended.  As most people know books are 1000x Better than their Movie or TV show counterparts!!<br />So, if you LOVED the show & want to further explore their fantasy world and have no patience until the 2nd season premiers...Definitely get the Books!! You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! ;)
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Great CD!  I listen to it almost everyday.  Urban is such a great singer.  Saw him in concert.  Loved it!
0062112430|3.0|Overall I enjoyed the book and I would recommend it.  If it actually had a conclusion, it would have gotten more stars.  It left me wanting more and not in a good way. So here's a more complete review:    I was excited to read Delirium after hearing so many great things about it. Let start with what I LIKED:    I LIKED the little details like the quotes ahead of each chapter from the creepy handbook explaining the \\"disease\\" of love.    I LIKED the world Oliver created.  The premise is interesting.  So many decisions we make in our everyday lives are more about pleasing the people we love than the common good, I wonder how like would be different if this weren't the case.      I LIKED Oliver's writing style.  She really is a lovely writer, the words flowed well and it was easy to read.    No on to the bad...    I DISLIKED the whole \\"love at first sight\\" angle.  Without giving too much of the story away, one of my major issues with YA lit is how easily the characters seem to fall in love. It's all about soul mates and love at first sight.  I'd love to see a realistic portrayal of young love for a change.      I DISLIKED the fact that story's conclusion was completely unsatisfying.  Its not that I didn't like the ending, more like there IS NO ending.  It made me feel like the whole book was meant to set up a sequel.
0802473156|4.0|This book is an easy read, especially for someone who doesn't read that often. A few friends recommended the book to me now that my husband and I are in our 8th year of marriage. It really helped to explain why he doesn't think to do the things that I need and why my ways for showing love aren't always received as positively as I would hope. I have recommended the book to many friends and I've even registered to hear Mr. Chapman speak at a nonprofit event next month in Chattanooga!
0307887960|5.0|This book is great!!  I have lost 20 lbs. and am working on the next 30.  I am never  hungry.  This is what I live by now.  Anyone trying to lose weight I highly recommend this book.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|let me start by saying i wasnt expecting much from this book, just something to occupy me in the afternoon but i got soo much more. this book has made laugh out loud sitting alone in an empty room. this is seriously worth the price. this book is also the type that you can read multiple times and still find it halarious

0451228731|4.0|I'm a software engineer with 25+ years experience so it's refreshing when I read high-tech fiction that doesn't frustrate me with its inaccuracies.  There was only one paragraph -- on page 464 -- that made me want to throw the book across the room.  That's high praise from me.<br /><br />As a designer, I was frustrated by the size of the book.  This edition, at least, is an inch or so taller than mass market paperback format and has largish top and bottom margins and text that is closer to the binding than the outside edge of the page.  Shifting the text to the outside of the page, clipping the top and bottom margins a little, and maybe cheating the leading some would have made the mechanics of holding and reading the book less onerous.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Martin continues his tradition of dragging out plotlines to the point where you want to skip whole chapters to find something significant happening.  His writing skills are excellent, but I've finally realized I don't care for his storytelling.  With so many point-of-view characters it's no wonder that his books crawl.  I have come to believe that he keeps adding characters simply because he runs out of people to kill.<br /><br />I was so disappointed in the ending, after taking so much effort to finish the book, that is the last of his novels I will read.  I am clearing the others out of my library.<br /><br />Read at your own risk and don't expect much in the way of a conclusion.  Then again, that's the way all of Martin's books are so I'm sure you know this already.
0345522478|3.0|The product review describes the protagonist as \\"a cool, new, funny urban fantasy hero\\". Urban fantasy hero maybe.  Although I found him somewhat less than heroic, since his ethical sense seems to sway whichever way will address his personal needs.  I don't actually mind that - I like flawed and even amoral characters as long as they're well written & consistent.  He's not.  Also, the same problem with his interactions with others.  They get judged by inconsistent standards as well.  Which wouldn't be as big a deal if the 'hero' didn't come off as though he's got all the moral answers.  I think there's too much sacrifice of character and theme to move the plot. However, the author is a talented writer.  It wasn't a waste of reading, just I'd hoped for better after reading the first chapter.

B004SGWYVA|5.0|This series was a pleasant surprise, while it did have most of the things found in other zombie movies this one went for more of a horror/thriller feel which it pulled off, as well as a bit of realism. E.G. protestors blaming the zombie hordes on the government and biological weaponry, which would very likely happen in real life.
030726999X|5.0|I think this was the best series I have read in a while and recommend it highly to anyone who likes mystery; the saddest part of reading the series is knowing that the author won't be writing any new books. I didn't know him but will miss his talent for writing; will always wonder what adventures Lisabeth could have had.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice gives a moving, first-person account of a woman coping with early-onset Alzheimer's.  Harvard professor Alice Howland first begins losing things (her Blackberry), then words, then herself (suddenly, she can't find her way home from Harvard Square, a path she has traveled for 25 years).<br /><br />Each stage of the journey is so movingly portrayed, from the shock and denial of first diagnosis, to the despair of gradually losing the ability to read, to the panic and rage of standing in your own house, unable to locate the bathroom.<br /><br />As a reader, I especially admired the way Genova immersed me in the experience of dementia.  At least twice, a paragraph is repeated, and because I was reading the book on Kindle, I double checked, thinking perhaps I had accidentally thumbed back a few pages.  Then I realized that these must be intentional repeats, asking me to experience the same confusion Alice feels as she circles back to the same thoughts and anxieties.<br /><br />The book asks excellent questions about identity and quality of life:  who are we when our memories and accomplishments are stripped away?  Can we find meaning in the present moments of joy, knowing we will have no ability to recall these moments?<br /><br />I'm appalled by the mediocre review given by Publisher's Weekly.  I did not find Genova's prose and dialogue the least bit clumsy or heavy handed; rather, I found myself in tears over the relationships as Alice's family members transform from husband and children to caregivers.<br /><br />Any reader will appreciate this book, but it will be especially treasured by those coping firsthand with the disease, who will surely find empathy, understanding, and a small light for a dark and frightening journey.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|There's a lot of negative word of mouth out there about this film and, honestly, a lot of it is built on the over expectation of a quick to despair comic book fanboy crowd. Of which I am one, proudly. The difference is I never expect an adaptation to sell it's soul to the source material. I judge it based on what's there, in front of me at the time I'm taking it in.     I did go into this with rather low expectations just from all of the online downgrading and came out of it with a smile on my face and the feeling of having a good time. This is a fun movie. Period. Don't look too deep, just sit back, relax, grab a drink and a snack and watch an hour and three quarters of good old escapist cinema. I know that, as a society, we're not allowed to enjoy anything unless it's \\"realistic\\" and \\"edgy\\" but try. There are some spots that drag a bit, usually in the Earthbound moments, but for the most part the pace sings along and the action is comic booky and appealing. There are aliens, space ships, intergalactic peacekeepers and galaxy threatening menaces that would make George Lucas sour with envy. This is not Academy Award material and I wouldn't want it to be. I want it to be just what it is, fun.
B002436WFI|1.0|Oh no!   If you are a Terry Pratchett fan, please skip this movie. It you're not a Pratchett fan you MUST skip this movie for fear of being turned off of Discworld entirely.     Sean Astin what were you thinking? BTW Twoflower is supposed to be Asian. And the sickly and bloated appearance by Tim Curry is just kind of sad.  Jeremy Irons brief appearance as Ventinari works well if a bit predictable but thats about the only highlight of this mess.     My wife and I are absolute Pratchet fanatics. We own every book. Listen to Nigel Planer's wonderful audio recordings over and over. We even enjoy the cartoon adaptations. While the animation is a little crude, the voice work is excellent. The Hogfather made-for-TV movie is pretty good, certainly A-for-effort.     But Color of Magic is an embarrassment.  We sat through the first two-thirds of the movie hoping against hope that it would get better. It didn't.  As it blundered on into it's second hour, we sadly gave up in disgust.     Discworld is a vast and wonderful place, but this movie does no justice. Please avoid if you're a fan or not!
B002VECMAO|2.0|Not stated here is that the \\"Digital Copy\\" for this movie does NOT work on a Mac, only on PC's.   That cuts out a big chunk of the home market, especially as Mac owners are more likely to have portable media like iPods or iPads.  Shame on Anchor Bay for making such a discriminatory decision.  I will avoid their products in the future.  This is not a rating of the film, just the Blu-ray package.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|At first this game looks like any other tower defense with Hex Defense look. However, after playing this game you will soon discover the versatile strategy you can do. The game is fairly difficult for beginners even in tutorial mode. However, it is easy to get use to and game actually takes strategy to win. Very interesting game.
0553801473|1.0|Clearly George Martin is being paid by the word.<br /><br />What else could account for a 1000-page novel, with more emphasis on describing food, clothing, hairstyles, scenery, and the genealogy of every plant the allegedly-main characters traipse by, on their slog from nowhere (the location the plot reached at the end of A Feast for Crows) to nowhere (the plot's final resting place)?<br /><br />The edition of A Feast for Crows that I read (from Amazon's box set of the first four novels) included an apology for that novel's lack of focus and plot development, with a promise that A Dance with Dragons would make up for it.  Consider that promise well and truly broken.<br /><br />Rather than plot advancement, we get a second helping of Feast's emphasis on who wore what, the trivialities on which they pondered as the trudge through exhaustively-described scenery, and a glutton's enthusiastic recounting of every dish at every meal, what it looked, smelled and tasted like, where the ingredients came from and how they were prepared, ad infinitum.  One suspects that the author was perpetually hungry while writing--and perhaps should have scheduled his time at the typewriter _after_ his meals, instead of before them.<br /><br />There's also the (now-formulaic) build-up of some character's plans, his surmounting obstacle after obstacle, drawing ever-nearer to success, and then -BOOM- death from out of nowhere.  Gratuitously killing off main characters just for the shock value ceased to entertain after about book 2.<br /><br />I'm grateful that I hadn't spent much time waiting for the release of this book, having been introduced to the series by HBO and having read all five in quick succession.  If I were one of the unlucky early-adopters who waited for years and years to get book 4 and then book 5, I might well be organizing some sort of sit-in protest at Bantam, until they agreed to handcuff no less than two rigorous editors to the author from now until the series is completed.<br /><br />As it is, I am unlikely to buy any further books in the series; I'll simply wait until others have bought, read, and been disappointed by them, and then borrow their copies.ed.<br /><br />As it is, I am unlikely to buy any further books in the series; I'll simply wait until others have bought, read, and been disappointed by them, and then borrow their copies.

B000GG4IAG|4.0|This 1950s thriller opens with a college couple's conversation about their unwanted pregnancy.  Her name is Dorrie; his is not revealed until much later in the novel.  Dorrie has a wealthy father who will surely disown her if she marries her lover and has his baby.  Her lover feels that abortion is the only answer, since, really, what's the point of marrying a rich girl if her funds are cut off?  In his mind, though, there is at least one other solution:  kill the girl, make it look like a suicide, and move on.  This scenario reminded me somewhat of Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy.  Anyway, the manner in which our anti-hero elicits a suicide note from Dorrie is clever indeed, and he still has a few more tricks up his sleeve.  So does the author.  The most intriguing section in the book is when Dorrie's sister Ellen, never convinced that Dorrie's death was a suicide, starts digging into Dorrie's demise.  She has just enough to go on to narrow her murder suspects down to two.  Since we still don't know his name at this point, we fear for her safety as she pursues these two strangers.  There are some very tense moments, and we discover his identity at the same moment that she does.  He's a twisted sociopath, emboldened by his horrifying success, who will now stop at nothing to achieve the social and financial status that he craves.  The dialog and quandaries may be dated, but the suspense that Levin generates has not gone out of style.
0553801473|5.0|I am a huge fan of Martin since the first time I read him back in the nineties.  Just like everyone else I was disappointed with book 4.  It was written well but didn't seem to go anywhere and Cersei and Jamie chapters aren't near as interesting as the chapters of the characters in Dance.  So I was excited to read Dance and yet anxious because I wasn't too sure what I was going to get: the writing of the first 3 or the writing of Feast.  Gladly, almost right from the very beginning, the Martin of old has returned to us.<br /><br />The characters are gritty and real.  Some are good, some are bad, and like Martin of old good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people.  We get to watch Jon as he struggles to control the Night's Watch and come to terms with what he is struggling with beyond the wall.  I loved his chapters probably the most of the main characters.  Tyrion's grew on me, although I didn't care for them as much in the beginning.  Daenerys also grew on me, although I wish her chapters would have had more resolution and moved the plot forward more.<br /><br />In the end you can tell Dance is setting up the greater climax in the coming final 2 books, but it at least had my interest from chapter one so I didn't mind that the plot didn't move as much as in the first three books.  I was entertained for all 950 pages and left wanting to read book 6 even more so.  If only Martin would hurry up.  I mean the HBO series is going to be producing a series a year, so Martin must have some idea of where his final two books stand in relation to the HBO series.  A definite recommend.<br /><br />5 stars.<br /><br />PS As a side note, I am amazed at the number of 1 and 2 star reviews.  I think it is a direct relation to how long it took Martin to come out with Dance and the fact that Feast left something to be desired.  Readers went in to Dance jaded and completely ruined their perspective of where Martin was and where he is now.  And what's with the 1,000 word reviews?  Honestly, I've never seen a book with so many people, from 5 star to 1 star, writing novellas about it.  Does anyone honestly ever read a review when you have to scroll down the page?
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Picked this up for my daughter's first B-day party.  It worked out great for a bunch of 3 and under children.  It's just over a month old now and has weathered several more sessions, so it's lasting the summer, which is all we were hoping for from an inflatable.  Make sure you pick up a small air pump to get this inflated!
B000003R7G|5.0|The vinyl version is the REAL way this record should be listened.    Every deatail in this album is incredibly produced, that analogue atmosphere is unique.    A master piece.
B004XS97KO|5.0|By far, the most intricate and exciting series to date.  The call backs alone make this season worth owning, just to go back and find the moment when x said y and then later z remembers it just as g is experiencing it.  It is all lovely and thrilling and very, very cool.
030746363X|5.0|It worked for me.<br /><br />I died.<br /><br />But rose from the grave.<br /><br />A splendid book resulting in near-miraculous results.<br /><br />A horde of folks should heed my testimony.
0345529057|3.0|These books are so frail and fragile that you will have pages falling out of each of the paperbacks if they have even the slightest wear and tear. It doesn't help that each of the books are over 800pgs, so inevitably you will be picking them up and putting them down quite a few times and then let the page tearing and falling out begin. Great stories but bad paperbacks. Also- this might be one of those rare instances when the TV show (or movie) is better than the book version of the story. Perhaps HBO should have made a series of Terry Brooks' \\"Shannara\\" series instead?
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Before anyone watches it, I would highly recommend that you watch the original series and the movies that go along with it. This is the second part of the rebuild series that are based in an alternate timeline, so those new the Evangelion series it would seem very rushed.    This part of the series seems to start off a little slow, but you shouldn't worry cause it takes off flying once it reaches a certain part of movie. I greatly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any fan of the Evangelion series.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Emma Stone rocks! There are not very many young actresses out there that have such a great style in comedy. Anybody who says that the acting is bad is stuck in the past. There are great teen movies from the 90's but come on its a new era people! Take a look around at the high schools around you! Yes those kids are the future!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I love this game on the computer but it's sad that the developer didn't take the time to add all the features you find on the pc version. It also takes too much time to load, I'm glad I got it free because I would be very upset of I'd paid money for it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very usefull,heck of a free app.  I would definitely recommend.  Have used on an Og Droid, Droid x and Toshiba thrive.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|The movie was charming--I felt as if I had been to Paris, but I particularly loved the music in the movie.  Will there be an audio CD soundtrack of the movie?  I will buy the DVD when it is available, but I would like to also have a CD.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a child of the 70s and early 80s, as well as a life-long gamer, programmer and fan of science fiction (i.e. geek), Cline's book is a tour of some of my favourite memories of my childhood and teens.

B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Just like real life, the characters in \\"The Matrix\\" perceive the world to be real, but the reality is that machines, not humans are creating the hoax, an elaborate deception, spun by all-powerful machines of artificial intelligence. Actually, they are in control of everything.<br /><br />And the conflict shows that there is no love lost between machines and humans in this futuristic story that is bound to give all computer hackers cause to take a second look at what they are doing.<br /><br />Graphics are excellent (not overdone).<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|Awesome service and delivery.  The only complaint is that the game doesn't play on PC that it was purchased for.  Works fine on family PC, which has same operating system, which is Windows 7, as the other so I am not sure what the trouble is but it has to be an update issue or something.  Otherwise, totally awesome.....Totally Recommend.
B002WWKZJK|5.0|How wonderful to have Kindle access to Georgette Heyer--I've purchased a dozen or more of Heyer's books that I'd never read before, including this one. CONVENIENT MARRIAGE has all the earmarks of the style that makes Heyer so well loved by her fans. Humor, crackling dialogue, adept characterization, with the addition of a flawed heroine who is nevertheless lovable and feisty. She is young but by no means unintelligent, and \\"Rule\\"--the earl she marries, is a delightful change from the hardened alpha male we often find in the romance genre, while not without the dignity or manliness we want in a hero.<br />This is a quick, fun read which I absolutely recommend.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I just went to see Adele in concert recently and I have to say her voice live is even better than the album! 21 is one of the only albums that I have bought that I have enjoyed every song on. Her voice ranges from world weary and slightly bitter to hopeful and triumphant to sassy. I don't/won't compare to her any other artist vocally. Her voice is unique and she definitely has an old soul. Amazing in one so young and she has made me a fan for life! I can't wait to see how much she grows in the future as an artist. 21 is a fantastic musical legacy and will hold up well 20-30 years from now.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|This movie was an incredible waste of an hour and a half of my life. The only thing worth watching was the 15-20 seconds of seeing Natalie Portman in a skimpy outfit. The only way this movie could have been worse is if Uwe Boll directed it and Will Ferrell starred in it (although as bad as it was I had to check and make sure Uwe Boll didn't direct it). Do yourself a favor and pass this one by. Save your money.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I am unfamiliar with the comic that this movie is based on but I am familiar with the `Cowboy and Indian' films that influenced it. Essentially they were popcorn movies designed to entertain with fast paced action and I am very pleased to say that this Sci-Fi take on the genre is a heap of fun as well.     Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are great as the gruff and tough Westerners and the supporting task is fine too as assorted parsons, bartenders, sheriffs, outlaws and Apaches. It is refreshingly focused on the action, with the romantic elements very much played down. I enjoyed the fist-fights and the great scenery. The aliens are suitably villainous (you can tell they're bad even though they don't have black hats - or any other clothes for that matter), though they did appear a bit too super-powered for the standard Western weapons to deal with. Things are evened up of course with Craig's mysterious bracelet. He uses it liberally too. Indeed, no one really holds back and the climax is quite the kill-fest.   The film also has some blokey chuckles and some eye-candy in the lead actress. There are a couple of nice emotional touches at the end but the highlight for me was the full-blooded tone that was taken with the action. I was thoroughly entertained and if you go into the film, as a previous generation did to watch those earlier `Cowboys and Indians' actioners, you should have a great time too!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The music is great, complete words to the songs included in the package and background on the story. Good pictures from the show are included as well.
006621131X|2.0|I approached this book from an unbiased perspective, having not read any of the rave reviews I now know it has received. I thought it was a total dud: Smith spends far too much time name-checking Rimbaud and recounting her highly anecdotal interactions with 60s and 70s icons, and her writing itself is frankly underwhelming. The most relevant details of the evolution of her relationship with Mapplethorpe are missing. The book did not strike me as one written by a legend of punk (a movement which Smith dissociates herself from in 'Just Kids'; the only fellow punker she dignifies with a mention is \\"the poet Richard Hell\\") - rather, it resembled the pompous and pretentious musings of a college slam poet. As a long-time fan of Patti Smith's music, I was decidedly let down.    I reviewed this book to provide some opposition to the storm of stellar reviews it has received from just about everyone. Seriously, it is not particularly well-written, it provides limited insight into the relationship between Smith and Mapplethorpe, and even less into the lives of the artists and poets of 1970s NYC punk.

0553801473|2.0|The way this series started I was so excited. After finishing the last available series book, A Dance With Dragons, I'm just so disappointed.<br /><br />As much as I really want to praise his work, his ingenuity and creativity... the slogging has become ever more difficult and pointless and there is no satisfying resolution to be had. I'm afraid GRRM doesn't see a way to tie all of it together. And worse, he really doesn't care. He's not writing for readers, he's writing for himself.
0545123291|5.0|Linger is probably one of the best sequels I have ever read. I think for most authors one of the hardest things to do is to write a wonderful sequel to a wonderful first novel. Ms. Stiefvater, you have done just that.<br /><br />Let me first say that Sam is HANDS DOWN my dreamboy. (If he is written on the basis of a real person, I might have to stalk this guy until he 1. falls in love with me 2. puts out a restraining order haha) In Linger, I got to see more of Sam's personality, his fears, his pet peeves. I adore everything about him. He's a little mopey at times, but can you honestly blame him? It's hard to be mad that he's slightly depressed when you're feeling the exact same way about his predicament.<br /><br />One of the newest predicaments would be situation with new werewolf, Cole. I didn't really like him at the beginning of the book and I'm still not sure where I stand at the end of this book. Maybe Forever will show me more of who he is and hopefully I'll see something I like. (He is just way too arrogant I think for my taste.)<br /><br />Also, this book was written from multiple points of view as opposed to just Sam and Grace in Shiver. For Linger, it is written from the perspectives of Sam, Grace, Cole, and Isabel. It really helped to solidify my liking for Isabel.<br /><br />This book is the second in a trilogy and for me, the second book is always the least favorite of the three. Probably because the first one sets up the general story and the third book brings everything to a close. But the second book? It's like filling in the story without closing it off and it doesn't really have a true \\"beginning\\" since that was in the first book. However, this book kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing and the cliffhanger at the end..well..let's just say that I am VERY excited for July 12th, 2011 - when Forever comes out.

B001E45XT4|4.0|Hello,    The quality is excellent to play games, but not for listen music.    The quality of the components is not bad.    They haven't good bass, but treble is good. For competitive play game with COD or BF will help you hear better what is happening around with more accuracy.    They aren't 100% comfortable, exert pressure on the head, but will be fully covered your hears and good noise cancellation.    I hope that can help you ;)
B000068FUS|3.0|When it comes to this band I'm of two minds. For a couple of songs I'm a pretty enthusiastic listener. When I play an entire CD at one sitting I lose interest. It isn't that I have to switch Cds. It's just that my mind begins to wander, fifteen minutes pass and, save for the guitar breaks,I have little recollection of what I've just \\"heard\\". Having said this, I must admit that I do continue to purchase the band's music. Why? Because on every disc there are a couple of killer sings that I MUST have.
0060007737|1.0|It was written in 2002 need I say more.  Things have come a long way since then.  Unless you are a big company developing a brand to compete on a level like Coke, Pepsi, McDonalds, etc.  Save you self the time and get a different book
0545259088|5.0|Although I've been done with Forever for about a week now, I think that's how much time I needed to gather all my thoughts and feelings about the conclusion to this trilogy.<br /><br />When I started Shiver, I was skeptical of this whole werewolf thing and was just hoping that the book didn't let me down too much. I had no idea that I would fall in love with this story.  It was one of those subtle loves; it crept up on me and before I knew it this love was full-blown. Next, I read Linger and I laughed with Grace - I cried with Sam - My heart went out to Isabel - and for the most part, I did not understand nor did I like Cole.<br /><br />Then I read Forever. And in this heart-wrenching read, I found myself adoring Cole - crying with Isabel - and my heart going out to both Sam and Grace. Who knew that four very different characters could elicit so many emotions from me?<br /><br />Maybe it was the way that Forever was written that made me feel so anxious and on-edge during the entire book. Some of the chapters are extremely short and you don't know exactly what's going on with that character and then it just cuts out. The next chapter switches POV and so you're left hanging as to what's happened with Cole, Grace, Sam, or Isabel. Things are happening simultaneously so I understand why it made sense to switch back and forth but at times I thought I was going to be ripped apart from the worry/anxiety.<br /><br />Forever in 3 words? Heartbreaking. Love. SAM.
0451167716|5.0|I would like to share with everyone some thoughts on the book that I read some days ago. It's called \\"The Godfather\\". I think that this is the best book I've ever read up to this day. I don't want to mislead myself here. I have read lots of good books both in Russian and English. Let's take for example Harry Potter I'd been a huge fan of since the age of 12. Or Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", my first book in English, the actual cause of why I am so interested in all this vampire stuff now.     Nevertheless, the Godfather has probably had the greatest influence on me. For one thing, it filled me in on the  things about America that I had no idea about. More than that, the book, in a way, has prepared me for my life in America, taught me the basics everyone who's going to US has to know about the country. In particular, the book told me what most of the Americans are like, what their priorities in life are. I don't mean anything bad here, I'm actually talking about such qualities as law abidingness, ambitiousness. It's good, I praise the American government that lets the citizens trust itself. The first quality I mentioned though, and the book proves that,  is not always  helpful  to a person striving for a good life.  Besides that, I'm pretty sure that I am now, thanks to the book, very well-aware of the social and political structure in America. At the time of Don Corleone the government was corrupted, and I am pretty sure that it still is, some of the rules have changed but for the most part in society the same system operates. What I consider to be the most important thing I got know by reading this book is the rule to reason with people . From my own experience I know that it works. It's not exactly the same thing that psychologists teach you in their books, they tell you not to get involved in the conflict altogether, try to avoid one and maybe even give up your own interests. Here, the Don tells you to stick to them, let your opponent know what they are. However, therule is to never let your own emotions take over, not to resort to offending, threatening others. Only in this way there's a chance they will listen to what you are saying and may do what you want them to.    The book deserves everybody's attention. I had to mention that the \\"The Godfather\\" depicts characters having completely different personalities, living completely different lives, having different destinies proving that these things go hand in hand. Through these, the book although saying that every man has only one destiny, gives you a hint on what your own future might be.
B0000062FL|5.0|I fully appreciate that another review of this gem is hardly warranted. Every Santana fan and every fan of classic 60's-70's rock is no doubt familiar with every chord on this Cd. However, as I intend to listen my way through and review all of my Santana discography, the omission of Abraxas would be a fatal error!<br /><br />When Santana was released in 1970 I was working in a Ma/Pa record shop. I got the job quite by accident. During the mid and late 1960's I spent a great deal of my free time hanging around this small store. In about '67 the owners,the proprietors, an older (I thought of them then as older - they were actually \\"only\\" in their forties, about twenty years younger than I am today)German couple mentioned to me that they needed a Thursday/Friday night and Saturday assistant. They suggested that as I was there much of the time anyway perhaps I'd like the job. It took me about ten seconds to jump at the opportunity. One of the perks of the job was that I could open any records that I wanted to play at the store. When Santana arrived in early summer 1969 we opened it immediately. It became a staple in the store for many months. The interesting thing was that the Schulzs loved the record from the get-go. In the sixties this was a pretty unusual situation - people in their mid forties just didn't listen to \\"our\\" music in those days. Although we had to play a James Last side every day most if the time it was Beatles, Stones, Janis, Doors et al. Needless to say I have never had a job that I enjoyed more. An added bonus was that I paid wholesale for all of my purchases.<br /><br />I have no favourite Santana records. Although there are many that didn't compare to the opening salvo I find it difficult to choose between Santana, Abraxas, III, Caravanserai, Lotus and Moonflower. The final three live tracks on the re-mastered Abraxas show how sensational the band was in person. They still are.
B00406UK7S|3.0|I remember before this movie came out, the previews were everywhere. It is not the epic struggle that the preview suggested, but it is not a bad movie either. The acting was uneven but overall pretty decent. No big-name stars. I like that. The actor doesn't upstage the character.
0525422943|5.0|I feel like words are so inadequate to describe the way I felt about this book. A facial expression or some kind of half-squeel half-sob feels more appropriate. But I'll do my best to explain in words how completely and utterly wonderful this book is.<br /><br />Where She Went is told from Adam's point of view..and boy is he damaged - \\"battle scars\\" in his words. Poor guy doesnt even know why Mia left him. My heart ached for Adam half the time and the other half I was seriously pissed at him because he was just acting childish i.e. throwing tantrums and some of the err..activities that he was engaging - ugh, I mean I get it dude..your heart is broken but really?<br /><br />The story telling method is similar to If I Stay in that it goes back and forth between the present and past. However, alot of the past memories were ones from the relationship between Adam and Mia and it was SO GOOD to see more of their relationship (since Mia's flashbacks weren't just about Adam).<br /><br />I really connected with Adam, which is weird because I am rarely able to connect with a male character. (It took me more than half of The Maze Runner before I could get into it because it's told from Thomas' perspective.)<br /><br />Ultimately Where She Went is about Adam asking himself this one question:<br /><br />Can you love someone enough to let them go?
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I felt as if I was there with the characters living through wars, domestic violence, heartbreaks, sacrifice and finally freedom. Certain parts of the story was dark and really difficult to read on, but a surprise twist at the end of the story brought with it the strength of survival and hope that tomorrow will be a better day. It's a must read!!!
0553801473|1.0|Let me preface by saying that I am a long time reader of this series. I even have a first edition GoT that I bought when it first came out at the bookstore (to read,not as a collectable).<br /><br />So, let the review begin. This book is very slow. The plot goes nowhere. If you look at the end of SoS, to the end of ADwD, very little has happened/changed.(If my review was ADwD I would have taken 10 pages to say the above)<br /><br />Many of you are so invested in the series (like me), that you will feel you have to read this book. Do yourself a favor and check it out at the library, borrow it from a friend, or support your local used book store. Just don't waste your money.
B004GYY714|5.0|wow, this just blew my mind. Now I can listen to radio stations from my home town in China all the way around the world. No need to create accounts or sign up for anything. Just start the application and go. Very easy to use.
0545123275|5.0|Let me sum up how I felt about this book in two words: LOVED IT.<br /><br />I've been searching for some new books to read for a little while now and I guess my biggest reservation about starting a new series is that it will let me down. But this was not the case for Shiver. I'd kept seeing it crop up here and there - on Twitter, GoodReads, etc. I'm not really a \\"werewolf kinda girl\\" - I mean I'm not necessarily a \\"vampire girl\\" either (Please don't get me started on Team Edward vs. Team Jacob..that is an entire post in and of itself). What I mean to say is that I initially shied away from Shiver because werewolves just weren't something I was interested in. But this isn't a werewolf story..this is a LOVE story. Beautiful and sad - just like Sam. Some people might find Sam a little..depressing? mopey? emo? Yes, he has more feelings than probably any boy that I know but that is what I love about him. So I prefer the term sensitive or maybe tender-hearted when it comes to Sam.<br /><br />This book is so good for many reasons. First, much like Beth Revis' Across the Universe, I really enjoyed the dual perspectives of the protagonists Grace and Sam. I was able to really get a good feel for both of these characters, who they are when they're together and who they are when they're not. I don't think I would have understood how they felt about each other if it had just been one-sided. I might have thought that the other one was a little obsessed, as opposed to in love.<br /><br />Also, the premise of the book is really unique. That werewolves don't change by the moon cycle but by the seasons. Wolf when it's cold and human when it's hot. Ingenious. And that eventually after a while, they stop shifting and become wolves forever..well you can see what the problem seems to be since Sam and Grace want to be together.<br /><br />I also really liked the minor character development of Isabel. She seemed rather sketchy to be in the beginning but she has grown on me and her love for her brother Jack is something that though I don't understand much since I don't have a brother, is something that I can appreciate and admire. The lengths that she is willing to go for him proves to me how strong of a person she is. Especially since Jack is kind of a jerk. (I wish I had read this before last week's Top 10 Jerks because Jack would have definitely made my list.)<br /><br />PS: the title of the book is very appropriate because after I read the last page, I had goosebumps. Oh, Maggie Stiefvater - how could you end a book like that?!that though I don't understand much since I don't have a brother, is something that I can appreciate and admire.

1400052181|4.0|This is an interesting read about how cell research developed.  Skloot does a fine job keeping the characters true to self which adds to the depth of understanding them.  It brought to light injustice, suffering, strength of character, and perseverance. Ehthics in medicine and research, race, politics, poverty, are woven with tender awareness.  I'd recommend it!
B001PBRCVI|5.0|This book was given to me by a friend.  I loved it.  The author writes a beautiful story.  I really learned more about the happenings in France in 1942.  It is really hard to believe that could go on and that it really isn't talked about too much.  I like the way the author goes from present to past alternating the chapters.  The way the 2 stories wrap around each other.  It is a heartbreaking story, but one that I just had to keep reading.  I was worried about the content being too upsetting to me, but I just had to finish it.  Highly recommend this book.
1441979212|5.0|This book is the perfect solution for students as me that have to write their research papers in English. As a result of read this book I have changed my style of writing (typical of people who write in my language) from long sentences in which I try to impress the reader of my knowledge, to short concise sentences where I try to make my findings clear to the readers. I am now also careful to distinguish my results from results already in literature and also not to copy whole sentences from other authors. The second part of the book is a step-by-step guide to write the different sections of the paper (including the title). Each chapter also tells you what reviewers typically criticise manuscripts for - these are very useful informations. I recently had a paper published that had at the beginning been rejected for 'poor English'. I succeeded in revising it myself and the paper was then published (in the same journal). Very useful book.
0525421580|5.0|At ALA, Jamie from Bookmarked told me basically how much she loved David Levithan and John Green (and she was so bummed that John Green was sick and couldn't come!). I knew who they were but I had never read anything that they'd written before. I fell head over heels for both of their writing styles (different as they might be) and I am so glad that Jamie introduced to me a side of YA that I don't feel like I had really seen before.<br /><br />John and David each have a character named Will Grayson and even though they share the same name, they are two very distinctive people. And they share a common friend - Tiny Cooper, whom I think I would both love and hate to have as a friend. Speaking of friends - that's what this book is about. It's about friendship and love and appreciation.<br /><br />While most YA would be considered appropriate for ages 12-18 or even 14+, from my perspective, I think this book's content is a little mature for a 14 or 15 year old. I'm not saying that the message isn't a great one, but some of the content may be (depending on the reader, of course). I also come from a very conservative family and so my opinion might be a little skewed. Either way, the overall message that Will Grayson, Will Grayson sends is something that I think everyone can benefit from.<br /><br />I loved this book. Oh, and I appreciate YOU. :)
0066620996|2.0|This book contains case-studies of companies that have gone from being good / mediocre / dying to becoming great, and gives 'analyses' of what brought about the transformations in terms of management, people, strategy, focus, etc. There were 20 people spending 15.000 hours on the research for this book which was then condensed by a former Stanford teacher into this book.    In my opinion the book is seriously flawed for several reasons.    The selection process started with 1435 companies which was narrowed down to 11 on the basis of their stocks having exhibited a pattern with a long period of similar performance as the market and peers, and then a long period of significantly exceeding the stock-market and peers. Rarely does the book ever discuss growth in revenue and earnings, improved profit margins, ROIC, ROE, debt usage, or other important numbers to demonstrate the improved quality of the companies. The book takes stock-charts as the measure of a company's greatness - yet it acknowledges that stocks can be highly irrational as in the noted case of drugstore.com.    The writing style seems to me manic and almost childish. The author strikes me as being very much in love with himself and his own ranting, and he devotes more space to his personal anecdotes than to quotes of the outstanding managers the book's researcher's have interviewed at length. I have given the book a rating of 2 stars because of these quotes scattered throughout the book, had they not been there I would have given it the lowest rating. Had the book instead been a collection of quotes from those managers, sorted according to theme and without the author's ego-rants, I could very well have given the book a 4-5 star rating. Sorry for being this harsh.    To the reader interested in learning about great business / life principles I would suggest getting it directly from great people instead, e.g. Sam Walton's book 'Made in America' is highly recommended. For the investor who wants to identifygreat businesses you may want to read Phil Fisher's book 'Common Stocks For Uncommon Profits' as well as Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway.    PS: This review is for the first edition (2001).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard i've used in a while. I liked the stock GB keyboard when I first got rid of my G2 and got a G2x, but after using this app, there's no going back. The auto-correct in this app learns from your texting style and facebook without you having to manually type in the words you wish it to correct for you. Overall, a really cool app.   I have only one gripe. It needs a theming system! I've been using the neon theme since I got it and it looks bomb, but it would still be nice to allow others to develop themes for the app. Add that and this app will be perfect.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|...but now that I've read the book, I think I understand them. This is sort of a critique of their poor and unappreciative reviews of a book that rivals the best work that Follett's done.    Reading several reviews both good and bad put me off the book originally. Penguin insisted on getting $20 for it,(Kindle) even after the sales popularity of the book dropped below that of PILLARS OF THE EARTH. Given the low average review, I wasn't willing to spend the money. Finally, my library's used book store came upon some copies and I got one for $4. Oh, how I missed my Kindle! This is what Kindle was made for--so you don't have to carry a five-pound book around with you. (I noticed when I pulled this up that the price has dropped to $19. Bit deal! The paperbook's coming out next week!)    But back to the book itself: it is an amazing accomplishment. Let me say this about ALL THE CRITICISMS. If they are valid for \\"FALL\\", they're equally valid for \\"PILLARS\\" and \\"WORLD\\". Stylistically and mechanically all three books are recognizeably by the same author, and are developed with the same considered approach. The characters receive the same level of nuance. The plotlines are seamlessly threaded into actual history with careful affection and fidelity. The conflicts are written with the same toned down emphasis uncharacteristic of Follett's earlier \\"thriller\\" offerings. So why all the bad press?    1.  I'm guessing some readers just don't read that much and were overwhelmed by the book's length. Follett inhabits his characters, and their narrative spins out with predictable rhythms, as do the threads of most of our lives. There is a great deal of detail and exposition to provide what the author feels is sufficient context. Wading though all this might be difficult for inexperienced readers.    2.  The historical period of \\"FALL\\" is familiar, or should be. Readers may feel that the closeness of the story to the memories of their own families requires it to be crisper or fresher, and that the characters should behave more like people living today, whereas in the earlier epics the story is in a period of history that almost no one is familiar with. It's like the earlier books were about King Arthur and the present one is about Bill Clinton. Personally, I felt that if there was a character fault it was the other way around. I was shocked by Maud's masterbating Walter in the opera. I just didn't believe that could have happened. In any event, I think that people came to \\"PILLARS\\" as a \\"LORD OF THE RINGS\\" sort of fantasy producing a special sort of suspension of disbelief. I don't believe \\"FALL\\" is granted the same sort of dispensation.    3.  Perhaps all the negative reviewers belong to the TEA PARTY.    But there are so many wonderful and good things to say about this incredible book.    I grew up in the 1950's and 60's--sheltered under the cloud of MAD (mutually assured destruction) produced by the nuclear threat from the Soviet Union. Communism always seemed like a joke to me. I couldn't imagine anyone believing that it could possibly work here or at all taking it seriously. Events proved my first impression correct. Communism is an empty fantasy that takes no recognition of the actual human condition.     But what I didn't realize was that early in the 20th century people didn't think that way. The reason that communist governments were so aggressive is that they seemed like the logical solution to the authoritarian monarchies of traditional Europe. The world held it's breath while they did their best to export their idiocy. The world once took them very, very seriously. More to the point, those who rose up and produced these early results felt empowered as if by the God they rejected! Their messianic message was tied to their own experiences at the hands of brutal oligarchs and aristocrats. One reviewer said that [he/she] didn't think Follett like Russia much. To the contrary, I think he struggled successfully to give a valid portrait of Russian life in the early 20th century.    I now feel that, thanks to Ken Follett, I understand why Joe McCarthy was able to capture the entire focus of the United States Senate and ruin the lives of so many artists and entertainers. Aristocrats of every stripe throughout the world suddenly had something very real to fear as the curtain fell on World War I.    The second success that I attribute to \\"FALL\\" is the creation of a carefully fostered sense of anticipation in the reader. WHAT'S THE SEQUEL GOING TO DO? What's going to happen to Fitz's son Boy? Will the Williams team of Labour MP's begin a political dynasty. Will Maud and Walter re-establish their aristocratic heritage in Germany? And the big one; despite not being a Sicillian, will Lev successfully begin a mafia family in the US?    Next time, I'll go ahead and pay Penguin's unjustifiably high price for the e-version of the book. I won't be able to wait!
0062112430|5.0|So before I give my review of this book, I'll tell you how it ended for me. I was sitting on my bed reading the last few pages saying outloud \\"No..no..no..\\" and then cried.<br /><br />Well, now that you know what you're in for - let me tell you why I loved this book.<br /><br />The concept of the book is a great one. A world where love is a disease that people can be cured of? Sometimes, people wish that they could stop loving people but a life totally devoid of ALL love? Having a feeling of indifference towards your parents, your siblings, your best friends? This is not a world that I would want to live in. And in this book, some people don't. They live outside of the fence in the wilderness. So, take your pick - comfortable life with no love or scrapping it out in the wilderness knowing what love feels like. I choose the latter.<br /><br />Much like some other dystopic novels I've read this year, the world that Lena lives in chooses her life partner for her. And while I'm sure he's a nice guy, he's not \\"the one\\". Lena doesn't even like him that much. I'm very happy that Ms. Oliver didn't make a love triangle in this book. It was clear from the moment that she met Alex that he had feelings for her and that she reciprocated those feelings. She fell in love and I fell in love with both of them. (A boy who recites poetry? Yes, please. Swoon-worthy for sure.) The connection between them was so real - taking something as simple as hanging out at an old abandoned house and making it seem so important. (Because when you think about love and relationships, isn't it the everyday little things that are the most cherished?)<br /><br />On to the ending - I cried. and cried. and cried. I almost threw my Nook because I was so emotional. Only after I finished reading, did I find out that this is in fact the first in a trilogy. Because let me tell you something, if that was the way the book had ended for good..well..Lauren Oliver, you would have been receiving some choice words from me.
B004XJHBCE|4.0|It really took me a long time to find a way that I like it. But now that I have found it, I am glad I bought it.<br /><br />At first, I did not understand that Folders = Labels<br /><br />At first, I did not understand how useful it would be to add my own custom Labels as they would become the names on my \\"Folders\\".<br /><br />At first, I found it extremely annoying that every single time I installed a new app or updated an app without a label it prompted me to assign a label.  But after I sat down and spent much of the day setting up my custom labels and assigned every app to either a useful custom label or my WillNeverUse label or my AllElse label it became a useful reminder when I installed a new app.<br /><br />At first, I did not understand that to use this, I wanted to add Widgets to my Android page called FolderOrganizerFolder Link for each Folder/Label and that the Apps was simply a tool to help me organize my apps and stuff into these folders.<br />  I really like the option to show tiny icons of the items within the folder/label as the icons for the folder/label itself.<br /><br />At first, it seemed no better than the Android 2.3 folders that I had already been using.<br />-- The \\"Folder Link\\" widget has no icons.  But to be fair, the apps within Android folders frequently loose their icons as well.  Because of this, you will likely rename a few apps because words alone do not help as much telling which app is which for two similar apps.  I guess icons really do help.<br />-- I cannot drag an icon into the folder (you have to open the FolderOrganizer App and assign a label)<br />-- I cannot swipe to a new Android page without first closing the FolderLink.<br />-- Most annoyingly, there is one line per app, not four, so if you have 40 games, you are scrolling thru 40 lines instead of 10 and are 4 times more likely to accidentally open up one of the apps instead of scrolling.<br /><br />I do which I could assign a label to a widget. This would be a good reason to switch.  There are a lot of cool widgets but only so much screen real estate.  Tho now that I have better assigned all apps to a label/folder, I have freed up 2 full screens for more widgets.<br /><br />The 4x1, etc. widgets seemed pointless as they do not scroll (unless you install another app).

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This will be another classic game. It is very engaging, fun, and interactive and a wonderful strategy game that teaches persuasive communication, negotiation, probability with die rolling, and organization. Instead of using play money for building/development, the game uses picture cards for purchasing buildings and roads. I think the game would be enhanced if they had incorporated play money so children have an opportunity to practice some different math concepts.
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|My first \\"Chick-Lit\\" book. If you're wary, DON'T BE! It doesn't matter if you don't think Chick-Lit will be for you or not - you will adore this book. I have been on a YA Contemp binge lately and this has been my favorite so far.<br /><br />A short list (from a long list) of things that I loved:<br /><br />  Perkins' writing style is free-flowing, nice, and true to the heart of a teenage girl.<br />  Anna is likable. Is she perfect? No, but she is imperfectly perfect. I want Anna as my best friend.<br />  The idea that home can be a PERSON, and not a place. I know this idea to be 100% true for my significant other is my \\"home\\", no matter where we may be.<br /><br />This book made me feel warm and fuzzy and just plain HAPPY. I smiled while I was reading this book - not (always) a giddy \\"hehehe - he's so cute\\" smile - but a genuine smile. That, above all, is what made me fall in love with Anna and the French Kiss.

0596805527|2.0|This book reads like a reference manual.  A hundred pages into the book he's finished with values and variables and he's still talking about _statements_, in great detail.  It takes him two hundred fifty pages to tell us how JavaScript is different from every other language that we know.    It looks like the remaining five hundred or so page might be fairly good, or at least comprehensive, but I don't really know - the first part was so boring that I never managed to wade through it.      I love programming, and for me good programming books are interesting and even exciting.  This one was far from that.  In addition to loading up all the boring stuff at the beginning, the author's style is clear but plodding.    Maybe I'm a little harsh.  It's not this author's fault that his book isn't the one I wanted - something like \\"JavaScript for Programmers\\".  (There's a book that purports to be something like that, but isn't.)  Still, I think it would have been easy to provide a path through this book that would allow us to get to the good stuff without trudging through so much detail, and this book is so far from doing that - I gave it two stars.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Great game. It isn't complicated but you still get a wide range of customizability. You will not be disappointed if you like RPGs. Also, the customer service is exceptional. The developers respond almost immediately.

0765365278|5.0|I love all of Brandon Sanderson's previous works, but he reaches new heights of sheer awesomesomeness with The Way of Kings. The world is stunningly well-realised, the magic original, the plot gripping and unexpected, and the characters tug at your heart-strings. Loved it. It has taken its place on my list of favourite books ever. If you love fantasy you simply must read this book.
B004YXE438|5.0|Best part is the ability to create custom puzzles from our family pictures. The grandkids loved it.  I suggested that the ability to save a custom puzzle with their picture that they could find on their own would b a significant improvement. Dev responded quickly, and sure enough the latest update had that capability.  Great follow up and customer service.

B004JAUCQE|4.0|Neil Young has been called Dinosaur JR for his influence in J Mascis' and Dinosaur JR's Music. Rightfully so, Dinosaur's albums were noised up lower string solo dominated pieces of art, every song an ode to Cortez The Killer. J has no trouble with Young's acoustic side either. This album is not the first with just him and a guitar, but again he shows us that at a more advanced age this is as easy for him as hammering out Sludgefeast at 140 db. J has moved beyond his \\"Yeah, right\\" stage with 10 beautiful intimate songs that sometimes even rival bandmate Lou Barlow's songwriting skills. Mascis remains a leading man in alternative rock with \\"Several Shades of Why\\".

B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought these for 172$ roughly three years ago, and now they are broken.<br /><br />I have had lovely times with these headphones, the best i have owned so far ,<br />- I have not had many phones and none cost above 40 dollars, so i cannot really compare.<br /><br />When i first heard them, i though they were too good, i mean, i heard the flaws in the mixing, and had to equalize the music when i heard certain songs in my computer.<br />It was very special, borderline fun, but also a pain in the beginning - it might be because they were brand new, or that i just had to adjust my ears from mediocre sound to good.<br /><br />My music-taste is very, very broad, and i see no particular music these fit for, it seems to be an all-rounder.<br />Some songs can be a bit descant, almost piercing - but i have never been too much into sharper soprano-music, and as i said, i often use a equalizing-program.<br /><br />Bass is pretty good in these phones, not perfect - but better than my computer-speakers.<br />All is about taste in sound, these will not fit everyone - what i can say is that both my sister and mother got jealous of these, so that says something.<br /><br />Yesterday it happened, the left channel left me, only to return, and leave me again.<br />I think that it was a bit soon for phones in this price-class, at least when i bought it.<br />Now i see that the price is about half of what i payed for, i also had to pay a juicy bill to customs.<br /><br />The price i payed was a total of 219$. I would not pay that price for these again.<br />Now these sell half the price - and they are worth it!<br /><br />I will not buy another pair of Sony-phones, because Sony builds a lot of electronics - none of them built to last, sadly.<br />As with a lot of other mainstream-brands.<br /><br />To sum up: Worth the price, but they will not last - if you want something you can have for years and years i recommend to check out the audio-devoted brands instead.<br />I would recommendthat actually, before you buy these - that's where im going next.<br />Goodbye Sony - we've had some beautiful times, but quite a short romance.<br /><br />Have a nice day, friends!
0385523394|3.0|I just finished reading Pipers account of her 1 year prison stint.  My thoughts are mixed as I ponder the lack of common sense that Piper showed after graduatig from college.  As Piper states in her book, she thinks of herself highly, and repeatedly reminds us that she is white, educated and well to do.  All that is fine, except that she must have lost her common sense right after graduation.  Running off with a women that you really don't know, getting involved with her, knowing that this is probably not the best choice to make, but Piper is ready to have a adventure, disregarding her morals and values along the way.  Then when Piper is brought to jail for her involment in illegal drugs, she starts ruminating about the snitch that sent her to jail. I did not once read where Piper was truly sorry for what she did.  She does mention in little blips that she knew running drugs was wrong, but she tends to blame others for her involvement instead of taking responsibility for her crime.  Towards the end of the book she talks about her brief experience in two other jails, and how horrible she and others were treated, and how staff had no interest in her or anyone else who was a resident there.  There is a reason people who break the law are sent to prison and left to stew in there anger, hatered and lonliness, and that is to really think about what brought them to jail to begin with.  I felt Piper thought she was above the law, and that she needed to be \\"entertained and paid attention to\\" while serving her time.    I was a bit disapointed that she did not talk about any of her friends that she made in jail, and where they are today and how they are doing. My guess is that Piper waved good bye a long time ago, and really has no intention of checking in with her \\"jail\\" buddies.    The book kept me reading, and the story is interesting, but I felt that more emphasis could have been made on her life after jail and what she has learned from her experience.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I read all kinds of genres but I have not read very many science fiction novels lately. I saw that this one was recommended by Amazon and that it had a lot of references to the 80's in it, so I bought it on my Kindle and started reading right away. I am a child of the 80's so I loved reading all the cryptic references to that decade related to video games, movies, computers and music. There is a part where the main character is inside a movie from the 80's and I remembered all the scenes the author described in great detail. It was like re-living my childhood. If you don't like science fiction, then this book might not be for you. But if you like either sci-fi, the 80's, video games, computers or adventures, then you'll love this book. It's one of the best books I've read this year and I read about 1 book a week. I look forward to more novels by this author!

0439023491|3.0|I'm sure there have been countless other reviews of the second book in this popular series, so I'm going to be brief. I imagine there are quite a few other people out there that share my opinion.<br /><br />The Capitol is very angry with Katniss and Peeta for forcing his hand in last year's hunger games. The districts are in rebellion and they are using the two as mascots and motivation. The second book in the series takes us back into the hunger games with a whole new arena. I found this arena to be much more inventive and played a major part in the story. The contestants are once again set up to battle until only one survivor is remaining, but once again things don't go as the gamemasters planned.<br /><br />I did not enjoy Katniss and Peeta nearly as much as I did in the previous book. They did not seem to grow. The other contestants also seemed to be a bit shallow, even though the book was set up in a way that left the door wide open for some new favorites to emerge. I'll be reading the third because the story ended with quite a cliffhanger and I am still quite attached to many of the characters in the book.<br /><br />3/5
0553801473|5.0|This book is actually a parallel to the one before it.  It fills you in on all the action with the characters you missed in the previous book and then links them back up again.  Great book, great series, i can't wait for the next one!

B005D0RDKW|5.0|About two or three weeks before my father and I, as well as a few good friends, went to this concert we all found out that a production crew would be filming it for a live DVD.  As a huge Rush fan, I was blown away by this.  I can promise you that both the band and the fans were on fire the entire show!  Cleveland was the perfect setting to shoot the film in and I am indebted to Rush for choosing the location, even though it is smaller than most large metropolitan areas, as in New York or L.A.      The concert itself was simply fantastic.  Moving Pictures was played all the way through and the rest was an awesome mash up of greatest hits, fan favorites and the newest singles material.  Neil, Alex, and Geddy were astounding as always.  I would recomend this title to anyone that enjoys live concerts, Rush, or any young person that is wanting to get into quality music.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|The album is great! Its very different and I can understand what she meant when she wanted to make songs from different genres and put it together; mixing the old tunes with the new. The tracks that I feel stay true this statement are \\"Love on Top\\" (Jackson five feel), \\"End of time\\"(contemporary), and \\"Party\\"(90s style); These songs are \\"feel good music\\", which is hard to find in the music industry today.    Of course she brings in the slow ballads like her previous \\"Halo\\"; two specifically \\"Start Over\\"and \\"I Was Here\\". I have to say these two are my favorites; it definitely showcases her range and vocal skills, most importantly the choruses are catchy.     Then we have \\"best thing I never had\\", although it cannot replace the popular \\"irreplaceable\\" its definitely one of the top hits of the album.     Overall leaving her father's management to accomplish her successes on her own, she is doing a pretty damn good job!
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could not like this movie. Cameran Diaz played the role to a tee. Justin Timberlake did a great perfomance as well and it was nice seeing the two together again on film (loved the dry humping scene!) Also as annoying as she was I loved the character of Amy Beaver not only because of how over the top corny she was but because I think we can all relate to someone similar to her character who has annoyed us at some point in time in our lives. I will definitely be watching this movie over and over again.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Although I haven't had these long, they sound great so far. They're also fantastically comfortable to wear, even for a long time. I can't say how they stand up to wear and tear, but at least out of the box they're wonderful.<br /><br />UPDATE: 7/10/13<br />I've had these almost two years, and they're starting to fall apart. The covers on the foam ear covers are tearing, a bit of plastic that keeps the wires from tangling broke off, and connection at the plug isn't 100%; sometimes the right channel cuts out. I don't hold this against them, as I'll admit I'm rough on them, but it's a little disappointing that they can't handle a little travel.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|I love post-apocalyptic movies. What can I say evil looking nasty vampires, a hard core main character who takes no s*** and loves killing vampires. I liked this movie from start to finish. Not for everyone. But if your into this kind of hard core stuff buy it or rent it. I hope their is a part two.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|I had the opportunity to see them live and I had only listened to \\"Pumped Up Kicks.\\" During their live show, I saw that they had some really good tunes. Almost every song is a hit on this album. Houdini has been one of my favorite songs and I've been listening to it for days.

B004XQO90O|4.0|What can you accomplish in the final eight minutes of your life? Can you save the day? Maybe prevent a bomb from detonating on a train? And if not that, can you reconcile with your estranged family? Or kiss the girl you just fell in love with? SOURCE CODE is a sci-fi thriller, and it's got its clever on. Running at a no-nonsense 94 minutes, it's spare and efficient and that's partly why it works. It drives up that sense of immediacy.<br /><br />If, during the first fifteen minutes or so (or even deeper in), you've become all baffled, then that means the plot's got you where it wants you. This is one of them films that drops a big reveal every few minutes. It helps that our reluctant protagonist is in the same state of bewilderment. 17th Airborne helicopter pilot, Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a Chicago commuter train seated opposite a lovely co-passenger chatting him up familiarly. Not too long after he glances at a mirror and sees someone else's face gazing back at him. And eight minutes after he'd first come to, the train explodes, killing everyone onboard, including him, false face and all.<br /><br />Colter Stevens now finds himself holed up in a sort of containment pod in some nebulous Army lab. A scientist informs him of the tragic train bombing which had happened earlier that day. She mentions experimental technology which would allow his consciousness to be projected onto the last eight minutes of the memories of one of the victims. Except that Colter Stevens would be able to act and therefore alter those memories. It's not really time travel, but for brevity's sake and because it's a sexier label, let's stick with that. Colter's mission is to locate the explosive device on the train and unearth the bomber... in eight minutes' time. You can see why the guy would need to be sent back time and again. With each reinsertion, with each new variation on how these eight minutes play out, Colter gets that much closer to piecing the puzzle together. And, somewhere along the way, he falls in love with that lovely co-passenger. And since she's being played by Michelle Monaghan who simply has this way about her, it's understandable.<br /><br />Operation Beleaguered Castle is the experimental program what's guinea-pigging Colter Stevens, and this venture just may end up saving countless lives, except that there's such a dehumanizing element involved. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a strong, wired performance as our hero purposely kept in the dark for a huge chunk of the film. He's strongly advised to not dig into his own recent past. Our guy demonstrates his ornery streak.<br /><br />Obviously, given the premise, there are bits of parallelism with films like GROUNDHOG DAY, 12:01, and DEJA VU, and if you're a fan of time travel (although, again, this isn't really time travel), you'll lap up what unfolds on the screen. Even if, in spots, you're rendered bewildered and perplexed and confounded (but having tremendous fun, all the same). I will say that I do agree with some of them other folks what said SOURCE CODE should've ended with the freeze frame sequence. That would've carried a more potent and poignant statement. Instead, the film trots out several codas too many, opts for a more conventional and rather chickensh_- ending. But that's my only bugaboo. This is a ripper of a movie, thrilling and surprising and smart and mostly full of good choices. And they're playing me for a sucker but I can't help but be amused each time Jake Gyllenhaal's character is told \\"Everything's gonna be okay.\\" And then the train explodes, unfailingly.ing the puzzle together.

0307913090|5.0|I'm not a big fantasy reader. I find the genre cliched and dull. And yet I love this book. I rank it in the pantheon of Susannah Clarke's Jonathan Strange, the Narnia Series, Philip Pullman's Golden Compass, and of course Lord of the Rings. I've not enjoyed and anticipated the next installment of a book in a long time.<br /><br />And at least as good as the book is Roy Dotrice's narration of it. He broke a Guinness Record for the number of characters narrated. Each is unique and powerfully acted. I love my drive to work in the mornings.
0670022411|4.0|I'm not sure how to feel about this book. Throughout this entire book I have swung back and forth between \\"its and absolute delight\\" to \\"its okay\\".  I do love the setting - London, Oxford, France and New York.  I enjoy books set in other places.  In this book there are 4 species - vampires, daemons, witches and humans.  Diana Bishop is a historian studying old alchemy texts.  When Diana inadvertently orders up an old text called \\"Ashmole 782\\", she triggers a spell that immediately alerts the supernatural world, and they all want it; the vampires, the daemons, and the witches who believe that it belongs to them. This text is supposed to contain the secrets of the beginning of all the species. Diana befriends Matthew Clairmont, vampire, who has his own agenda, but ultimately he wants to protect her. Diana soon finds out there is a whole lot more going on than what she initially thought.  Lots of secrets.  Matthew finds himself very attracted to Diana. Since witches, vampires and daemons do not fraternize when each other they find themselves under the scrutiny of \\"The Congregation\\".  There are a lot of twists going on this book. Ultimately I would like to give this 3-1/2 stars but I end up giving it a 4 when I reached the ending.  The time-walking aspect of this book really appeals to me and I am very interested to see where Deborah Harkness takes us next.

0553801473|4.0|No huge review.  I just think the book deserves more of a break than some are giving it.  It's not the end of the series, it's book 5 of 7 (or more).  There's a lot of moving pieces around, a lot of preparation, not a lot of closure, but that's OK.  It's an entertaining read, and there are 2 more books left to wrap things up.

But once into the story I couldn't leave the book behind, even to eat. Let's call this the book diet! The Hunger Games Diet!<br /><br />Anyone who knows me know I love learning survival methods. I watch all those shows on Discovery, have loved long hikes with rangers describing the edible and poisonous plants and I love knowing how to help in case of emergencies. My own novel starts with a crash that requires first aid, so this book was right up my alley.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to start the next one!

I know what the product is going to have and what it isn't going to have based upon the product details.  I will explain my 1 star rating in two words.  Hayden. Christensen.  He wasn't in the original movie, why is he in this one?  He butchered the second trilogy and he butchered the \\"remastered\\" version of the true trilogy.  Why should I have to suffer and only be able to receive the crap that Lucas wants to put out?  Make it available to have a choice and I'll change my rating, but as far as I'm concerned this product is only worth 1 star.
0061998494|5.0|Very raw and very honest autobiography of America's funnyman for the 21st century. If you watch the Scottish-American's talk show you know and love his humor. Just don't expect this from his life story. This is more a tale of what not to do as far as sex, drugs and rock and roll. Well, more like relationships, drink and why you shouldn't practice drums in a flat in the UK.<br /><br />Anyway, Ferguson writes in just as entertaining a style as his patter on \\"The Late Night Show With Craig Ferguson\\" but it's more entertainment in the way we stop and watch train wrecks. His personal life pretty much up till his gig on \\"The Drew Carey Show\\" and even during parts of that are more full of the \\"holy crap\\" moments here we go again, Craigy.<br /><br />As many of you know he's also the only celebrity I know with any taste at all in music for any of us who grew up in the punk/New Wave '70s and '80s and throughout the book there are some tasty references and encounters with some of the names and lesser knowns of the UK scene at that time. Throw in Craigers ability to explain the whole Rangers vs. Celtic soccer/sectarian rivalry without getting bogged down in semantics, I give him kudos for that (even if he's a Hun bastard...just joking, we're all friends on this side of the Atlantic).<br /><br />All in all a page turner but the word \\"enjoyable\\" would not be one to describe the experience as I said at the start, it's more Trainspotting before it becomes Mr. Ferguson's American Dream.
B000JJSPXQ|5.0|Never heard of this group before (I'm almost 60 years old)and just happened to hear one of their songs in some movie I rented.  Waited until the ending credits to see who sang the song, and it was the Roxettes.  Ordered this CD and another by them and love them both!  As usual with Amazon, I got great service and a great price.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Like many of you I am a very long time fan of Yes. When I heard that Yes was in the studio making a new album I was very hopeful. When I heard Geoff Downes had rejoined the band I thought \\"cool, Drama II\\", dark and full of intense bass riffs. Then Chris Squire said in an interview that the center piece of the album was going to be \\"Fly From Here\\", a song the performed on the Drama tour but only released as a bonus on \\"The Word Is Live\\" box set. My hopes kind of sank. What could possibly be good about a rehash of material from 1980! I ordered the album because there was no way I could be without a new Yes album, but I did so with some trepidation.<br /><br />I am very happily surprised to report that the album is very good. Not CTTE, Relayer, GFTO, or Talk good, but definitely Drama or The Ladder good (both of which I like very much). The emphasis on \\"Fly From Here\\" is not pyrotechnic displays of chops, but is on solid song writing and cohesive performance. The reworked and extended song \\"Fly From Here\\" really seems like a complete work and not at all a slapped together Franken-song. The fact that Trevor Horn produced it doesn't hurt one bit. The other songs are good too. Some of the songs vaguely Pink Floyd vibe; very cool without fiery arpeggios that are so common with other prog bands.<br /><br />So how much do I like this album? I wake up in the middle of the night with Fly From Here going through my head. For me, that means I like it a lot! I have listened to it every day since I got it.<br /><br />The well known members of the band live up to their reputations and I leave their critiques to the world wide web of flame wars. I want to focus for a moment on Benoit David. I think he sings great. No he's not Jon, but neither is he Trevor Horn or Chris Squire in the vocal department. His voice is clear and cuts through the mix. He has the same range as Jon and he does an admirable job on the older material in concert. On this album, though, he is his own voice. The harmonies on this album are the best ever recorded on a Yes album with only the song Nine Voices from The Ladder coming close. He and Chris Squire complement each other really well. And, since he is so much younger than the rest of the band, I am looking forward to years of works from him. C'est bon M. David!<br /><br />PS I think it's funny how they pronounce altimeter. In the US we say Al'-ti-mit-ter; in the UK I guess they say Al-tee-mee'-ter. I wonder if this is how Benoit would pronounce it normally with his French/Canadian inflection?are the best ever recorded on a Yes album with only the song Nine Voices from The Ladder coming close.

B00354Y9ZU|4.0|What is a linchpin?  How do you become a linchpin?  What are some of the barriers to becoming a linchpin?  Seth Godin, author to the entrepreneurial-spirited, corporate-working, self-enrichment crowd, answers these questions - and many more.<br /><br />A linchpin is not someone who does the day-to-day drudgery; he or she offers much more.  They add value by their ability to `make things happen' even if there is no roadmap.  A linchpin is able to connect with and influence others.  Most importantly, a linchpin has the ability to overcome resistance, whether that resistance is exerted internally (by what Godin calls the `lizard brain') and/or externally (closed-minded and uncooperative management).<br /><br />A linchpin is also an artist.  \\"Artists are people with genius for finding a new answer, a new connection, or a new way of getting things done\\" (Ch. 1).  It is not art if you followed a standard model, map, or rote procedure, that would mean that it has been done before; your art has to be `uniquely creative'.<br /><br />The advent of the linchpin is a result of the evolution of the business model.  We are no longer making widgets in a factory  assembly line - which was something that could be quantified and used to track worker productivity.  Today, progressive thinking is more valuable, indispensible.  But for most of us, we still work as if our work is forecasted & tracked.  To paraphrase Godin, our work has changed, but our psyches have not.<br /><br />Read this book to help build your roadmap to becoming indispensible.
075666733X|4.0|The 5 year old grandson and I love the book.  We read and look at it every day and are on our 2nd time through.  He even remembers the page number we stopped at the day before.  The DVD didn't much interest him as it didn't \\"move\\" (stills rather than a video).  An excellent book--vivid drawings/images in a large format and informative.
B0001I55SS|3.0|A happy childhood memory from school holidays- seen in beautiful 70mm with Dolby Surround, 'The Black Hole' was great to watch as a kid.    But the fact is, as a movie it's pretty ordinary.    This was Disney's shot at cashing in on the resurgence in sci-fi bought on by 'Star Wars'.    Killed by dull direction and a beyond formula, moronic script.    The cast have a go, but they have almost nothing to work with.     Maximillian Schell is kind of a bizarre, gay Captain Ahab. His weirdly homo erotic relationship with his sadistic hulking robot lends a very strange subtext to proceedings.    But the movie looks and sounds so magnificent!     John Barry's music score is a classic.    The production design by Disney effects veteran Peter Ellenshaw is outstanding. His elegant, cathedral like ship designs and robots are brilliant. All set against sea blue star fields, that give 'The Black Hole' an incredibly distinctive look- very much apart from 'Star Wars' or 'Alien'.    Frank Phillips lush wide screen photography deservedly got an Oscar nomination as did the often eye popping visual effects.     Ripe for a 21st century remake.

B005HED5YW|5.0|I'm watching Star Trek Original (Remastered) [HD] Season 1 Episode 1 on my computer with a Dell 20\\" 2001FP (4:3) and I have a 1.5\\"-2.25\\" black frame around the picture.  This is the first thing I've watched on Amazon Prime Streaming and I hope this isn't par for the course.  I give the original Star Trek series 5 stars, but I give the way this was encoded 1 star.  It's as if the original 4:3 content was encoded into a 16:9 format, so when viewed on a 4:3 screen you get a black frame around the picture.  Instead of a 20\\" picture I have a 15\\" picture.  I hope they correct this in the near future.  Edit:    Now that I've watched a majority of these \\"Re-mastered\\" episodes I want to comment on what a good job they did with the re-mastering.  The new special effect cut scenes and models integrate beautifully into the original content.  You barely notice that something is different, which means it's in perfect balance.  The cut scenes of the enterprise in space are there to add to the story line and transport you to that far off place, not a \\"wow\\" factor, and they work marvelously.  Kudos to the special effects artists and editors that made this happen.
030788743X|5.0|An enormously entertaining read, especially for those who lived through the 80s.  And an essential reference for those who want to re-live the 80's as well!

0553801473|2.0|This book is about people talking. And thinking. And making plans. Lots of plans. Plans made, plans abandoned, plans changed. But no plans acted upon, oh no. We wouldn't want that. That would kill the immersion. Immersion in cement, quickly hardening, thickening much as the plot has, never to move again.<br /><br />Immersion happens within a story, around events and characters and locations you care about. Immersion in minor details unrelated to the plot, in the histories of towns which you have never heard about and will never visit again - what good is that? If you were on a (paid) tour of historic landmarks in London and the guide began speaking of the history of New Zealand, because, you know, Australia was a colony of Britain and New Zealand is right next door, would you feel like you got your money's worth? Of course not.<br /><br />George bombards us with copious descriptions of food and ruins, serving no purpose beyond his transparent desire to showcase the detailed history of his world. Dragons came, things done got burned, now they're ruins. We got it the first ten times. We especially got it after Tyrion took a mind-numbingly boring carriage ride to nowhere. You know, the one where he woke up, ate several paragraphs of food, took - or witnessed - pisses, looked out the window and described a ruin, ate more paragraphs, then slept and repeated it. And repeated it again. And again. And again. And suddenly the chapter was over, and you were left wondering how any editor worthy of the title had left that in the book. If you were like me, you wondered that several times while reading this book.<br /><br />Dany, as a character, is unrecognizable. Gone is the fierce Dany of old, replaced by a painfully clueless teen girl with a mindless crush. A girl who worries more about what she's wearing and who is staring at her than any events occurring around her. Twilight's Bella would look down on ADWD's Dany.<br /><br />\\"Are they looking at my breast? They should totally be looking at my breast. I want them to look at my breast. Ooh, a penis. I'm turned on. Can they see that I'm turned on? They should totally see that I'm turned on.\\" SHUT. UP.  I half expected Dany to whip out her phone and text,<br />\\"like omg, dis guy iz SOOO totes hawt! LoL >;P<br />*~*~*DrAgOnQuEeN Dany*~*~* \\"<br /><br />This book could have had interesting moments, but they were all killed with chapter after chapter after chapter of setup and minor plot details hashed out in painful detail. So when the big reveals finally come, they're things you knew about hundreds of pages ago, making you wonder why the revelation was left hanging at the end of a chapter, as if it were a big deal. Showing the same revelation from multiple points of view isn't interesting, it's unnecessary. Show it from the point of view which would have the most impact and at the time when it would be most startling, then get on with the freaking story.<br /><br />Not even the cliffhangers are really even all that interesting, because they're just more setup. More setup instead of something actually happening.<br /><br />If AGOT had gone at this pace, the book would have ended with Ned and Robert arriving back at King's Landing after having described every meal and farmhouse to be eaten or seen, respectively, along the Kingsroad, and with readers left wondering why it was called \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and not \\"A Ride in Carriages.\\" Just as readers of this book will be left wondering why it's called \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\" Because fewer dragons make an appearance than do turtles. You can call it \\"A Swim with Turtles,\\" if you'd like. It's a far more apt description of the book and its pacing.<br /><br />These last two books should simply never have been written. There is not enough story here for one book, let alone two or three. And I don't understand George's sudden distaste for flashbacks. Some of the signature events of the series have been told entirely through flashbacks, stories, recollections, and so on.<br /><br />Robert and Ned's uprising. The Starks being murdered by the mad king. Jaime's murder of Aerys, and Ned finding him seated on the Iron Throne. The murder of Elia and her children. Lyanna and Rhaegar, from the tourney to the Tower of Joy, with mysteries as diverse as frog men and blue flowers. Tyrion's wedding. Heck, even recent events like Rob's victory in the west and his marriage. All major events do not require books/chapters devoted to them.<br /><br />Considering that those events were told so well through flashbacks, does anyone besides George honestly believe that the carriage rides and all-around NOTHING that has happened in AFFC and ADWD were so much story that they had to have entire books devoted to them? Honestly?<br /><br />After AFFC and the long wait, I promised that I would only borrow ADWD, not buy it. I made good on that promise, as the lack of \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\" on this review will attest. With George utterly unrepentant in regards to the pacing, style, and long waits for these past two books, I am now promising the same for Winds of Winter. And I'm not alone.<br /><br />This series may still be redeemable, but I doubt that I will ever find it in my heart to forgive GRRM for making me DREAD Dany and Tyrion chapters. Dread, it rhymes with bread, served with bacon grease and garlic and... oops, I've found myself randomly writing about food every few paragraphs since finishing this book. I've also taken to letting food dribble down my chin, since ADWD showed me that it is impossible for grown men or women to eat without slobbering all over themselves. It is known.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is absolutely the best version of Angry Birds. I really got tired of the old Angry Birds cause everywhere you go    somebody is playing it and it's kinda annoying. When it comes to Angry Birds Rio words can't describe it.
B004289ZW0|1.0|Battery life is great but on the second use, the touch sensitive on/off swipe would not work.  Had to use reset(with paperclip) to turn it off.  Battery was dead by the time I was able to turn it off (using the post of my ear ring).  Worse was to turn it back on after it was charged required connecting an external power source.  I returned it and bought Bad Elf.
B004T0XYM8|1.0|I'm sure that I'm going to get a bunch of comments telling me that I \\"just don't get it\\" like anyone does when they write a bad review of something artsy but here goes.       This is the only movie with Charles Bronson in it that I've ever seen and not liked, he's one of my favorite actors. And I love westerns, pretty much anything with John Wayne or Clint Eastwood is gold. Hell, I even love most of the cheap spaghetti westerns but this film SUCKED!!! Every damn scene is drawn out till it's completely dead and dried up. It's ten minutes of silence and camera panning then two minutes of talking then ten minutes of silence and panning again. Over and over.    This is not a western. It's a artsy joke. Easily the worst cowboy movie I've ever seen!
B002ZG975Q|4.0|My daughter recommended this movie to me and I liked it.  The story of Beauty and the Beast told in a modern setting with a few interesting twists.  Definitely a keeper and a movie I'll watch again.
B004KO8036|5.0|I bought Red Fang's self titled album (compilation, rather) after hearing the song \\"Prehistoric Dog\\" on youtube. While I loved the single that drew me to the album, I wasn't that blown away with the rest of the output. There were several interesting tracks, but on the whole the result was kind of sloppy and raw (and not in an altogether positive way). But their effort was enough to draw me to this album, Murder the Mountains, and I am very happy that it did. This album is amazing. I listen to a lot of sludge/stoner type metal (Kylesa, Mastodon, QOTSA, Kyuss, Intronaut are among my favorite stoner/sludge metal bands), and this album is a shining star from top to bottom as far as stoner metal goes. Sludgey and intense. Yes, it draws from other bands (the Melvins, QOTSA, Kyuss, even a little White Zombie in there), but the total package comes together as an intensely focused set of mind-melters that swivel and churn in my brain anytime I'm not listening to them. Unlike the self titled compilation, Murder the Mountains works as a cohesive whole, with one throbbing track pulsing into the next. The vocals have taken a huge step forward from their prior effort, as well. These songs are melodic and have definite hooks. The most important thing in the metal/stoner rock that I enjoy is the head nod factor. Do the songs make me nod my head and want to head bang while driving down the road or while doing laundry with my headphones on? Every track here the answer is a resounding yes. This has quickly risen to the top of my metal heap and I've been listening to it for days on end without cease. I look forward to their efforts in the future, and hope that Murder the Mountains is the first triumph of many for this band.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Ros came into their own on this release, one whose most successful tracks are centered around heavy drones created by using a violin bow to manipulate the strings of an electrified guitar that is heavily channeled through what sounds like a ridiculous amount of reverb and delay. \\"Olsen Olsen\\", one of the outstanding tracks from this release,uses this same effect to great advantage, though it is much more \\"compact\\" than \\"Sven-F-Englar\\", which is accretive in the way it builds dynamic tension, and  uses the heavy drone to alter its spatial quality, so that it yawns into crescendo and builds toward explosiveness.<br /><br />Lead vocalist Jonsi sings in a falsetto that practically pitches his range into that of a modern-day castrati, and the phrasing on each cut is somewhat sensitive, sensual, plaintive, and emotive. His lyrics, have never been decipherable and aren't even delivered in his native language (Icelandic), instead sung in a glossolalic hybrid he dubs \\"Hopelandic\\". Strings, piano, and keyboard are often responsible for creating some of the richest of the gentler, more atmospheric moments, some of them quite mournful in nature, others joyous and transcedent.<br /><br />Over three hundred other people have reviewed `Agaetis Byrnum\\" by this point, and if you happen to be reading mine, it's because it happens to be the most recent. This isn't a purchase that you should make if you like tidy, three-minute hook-laden pop songs;  many of the tracks take time to unfold and sprawl in length. I can tell you that it's an evocative, emotional release that is warm at times, glacial at others, but with a universal genius readily apparent when it comes the construction of each track, and a gift at deconstructing and re-interpreting how each one is presented. Start here with Sigur Ros.

0307595579|2.0|i was disappointed in the quality of this set as the original sticker on the box said the value was about $99; while I paid about $35, the quality of the books is clearly second rate.  page material is cheap and edges are not cleanly cut; there were no slipcovers on the books.  definitely not a 'keepsake' or gift set.    i wasn't aware that the discount price i paid meant i was getting discount quality too.  i will think twice before i order books from here again.

030788743X|5.0|This debut novel from Ernest Cline is set in a dystopian future where a significant portion of the world population is competing to win an online virtual reality game designed by a computer genius who lovingly recreates everything gloriously geeky from the 1980s where he grew up:  Video arcades, Star Wars, Voltron, D&D, Back to the Future, Zork, Blade Runner, Atari, Devo, etc.  So yeah, this book is totally gnarly.    Some of the negative reviews have pointed out that the characters are one-dimensional, that the writing is simplistic, that there is too much nostalgia and that the ending falls apart.       The writing is quite simple.  This book is written at the level of a young adult book like \\"Hunger Games\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" and like those \\"simple\\" books it is written well.   Are the characters one dimensional?  Sure, but it's an accurate rendering.  The young people in this book are computer obsessed uber nerds who have forsaken real life in order to complete a mythic quest inside a virtual reality.  Elite \\"gunters\\" are not well rounded kids.  Their overriding interest is advancing their position in the game.         The criticism that there is too much nostalgia and that the ending didn't fit is off base.  Nostalgia for the 80's is what drove OASIS's (the worldwide and completely immersive virtual reality) creator to design the game the way he did.  The nostalgia makes perfect sense in the context of the virtual story within the real world story.   The ending was pitch perfect, made sense and was gratifying.    Is this book for everyone?  Definitely not -- but what book is.  If you grew up in the 1980's and loved the dorkier elements of that decade, you'll enjoy this book.  It is a quick read that`s a lot of fun.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Perfect product, just as advertised. Very prompt shipping!  Now that I have watched the first season of Pretty Little Liars, I finally understand what is happening on the show this season. If you missed season 1 and now can't get enough of this show, you NEED this DVD!

In that order.    Again, nothing short of a Rap Masterpiece.

B004WR125O|1.0|I CAREFULLY read the manual, CAREFULLY followed the instructions and carefully installed the Wireless LAN per the instructions (from three different sources!). Hey it works! NOT! My Onkyo display initially displayed it was getting about 25% signal from the router which is perhaps 25 feet away in another room. I thought about it, and went ahead and relocated the router into the same room, right beside my Onkyo receiver (which is awesome BTW, and so easy to install on it's own merit!). After relocation of router, I tried again and was never able to get the thing to work at all, even after spending a couple more hours re-reading the Onkyo receiver manual, plus the instructions that came with the UFO-1 (read UWF-1 or should it be WTF?-1 wireless LAN- only kidding) and it was never again recognized by the receiver when plugged into the USB port on the front of the Onkyo. Now, I'm about as smart as the next guy, and I carefully researched this issue, even going online to Onkyo's on technical support site, which was NO help whatsoever in this instance. The manual and instructions were rather vague and not that helpful, hence I finally decided to give up in frustration, returning the adapter back to Amazon for a refund. Amazon has FANTASTIC customer service, however this particular product fails miserably and I'm surprised Onkyo even released it for sale, given it's poor design/performance. Hopefully, they will soon address this issue. Until then....    Consider that if you physically can, just go ahead and use the wired connection via ethernet cable to the unit from your router and your issue is magically solved! You will save money, plus time and frustration! I would not have purchased this product had I known that was an option. One would not know until they had read everything and finished setting up the unit.
030788743X|5.0|Was trolling through Amazon looking for something to read during a road trip  from Phoenix to El Paso last weekend and found Ready Player One.  I'm SO happy I did. I've loved every moment of reading it (three times now)!  Highly recommend to any Child of the 80's or Geek of the World.  Enjoy!!
B004KRQFI0|5.0|I can say honestly, that I actually like every track on the CD.  If you like electronic, house, dub step, and house, then you'll love this.  Recording quality and production is top notch.  There a good range of sounds, rock, rap, electronic, dub step.
0316077054|2.0|I really enjoyed the first book, but I honestly could not finish this one.  I found it boring and depressing and couldn't take it any more.  I will not be reading the 3rd installment...they lost me halfway through this one!
030788743X|4.0|I hear Ready Player One has been optioned for a movie. I request - nay - demand that MC Frontalot provide the soundtrack, or at least the theme song.    Great, fun story. It's a Gen-X geek candygram in the same way Stephen King's \\"It\\" was addressed to the Baby Boomers. But without clowns.     Us geeks are a bit notorious for optimistically believing we can get non-geeks to share our passions, but to be honest I'm not sure how appealing this book would be to the generations ahead of or behind mine. I say this not as a knock on the book but just as a point of information. The level of pop culture referencing here is like nothing I've ever seen - picture Joss Whedon with 10 cups of coffee and a bottle of speed in him and you begin to get the idea.  This could be off-putting to someone who knows little or nothing about the 80s, kind of like being introduced to a new group of people and then having to sit through all their in-jokes. I know I'd have an attention problem if this level of detail was aimed at 50s or 60s culture. There's also a certain assumption of familiarity with videogames that might cause confusion for some. Tell my mother you're preparing for battle by buffing your avatar and she will picture you taking out a rag and polishing your armor.      Notwithstanding the setting, if you compare this to other dystopian books you will find this is essentially a plot-driven novel with deeper issues only touched upon. This is as it should be, because a somber tone would have clashed with the wild, high-tech treasure hunt theme. That being said, the story contains some nice twists that increase the seriousness just enough to keep things urgent.     Since I'm definitely part of the audience this book aims to please, I was surprised to find my attention waiver a couple of times. This was almost always connected to Wade delivering some sort of explanation about his world or the OASIS when I would have preferred that he show me what he was talking about. Or, sometimes he'd give me a summary of something he did when I would have preferred to be there with him because, hey, I liked the guy. I suppose the goal here was to keep the book under 400 pages, but this is a rich enough universe to warrant a higher page count. I would have gladly stayed on board, and will certainly pick up Ernest Cline's next book.

B0051CSIKQ|4.0|The stylish 2010 independent horror film \\"Stake Land\\" is a variation of a lot of previous works, some better, quite a few not. It's a moody vision, dripping with overcast days and the corrosion of a dying world. The key to its success is attitude, and filmmakers play the game with a straight face. I love the atmosphere, as morose as anything seen in the bigger-budgeted [[ASIN:B001FB5634 The Road]].    Sometime in the not-too-distant future, the world is overcome by the obligatory virus rendering the dead into a form of vampire/zombies. They can only be killed by a stake through the heart. Rural teenager Martin (Connor Paolo) becomes an orphan in the opening scene, but he's saved by the mysterious stranger Mister (Nick Damici), a trench coat wearing warrior whose obsessive mission appears to be ridding the land of the undead. He adopts Martin as a protégé and they travel cross country in a coughing Buick, taking down Nosferatus wherever they may roam. It's a fun set-up, aided by unshaven facades and worn clothes having seen better days. During their journey they encounter pockets of civilization, fortified compounds involved in trade, heavily guarded when the sun goes down.    Okay, the apocalyptic genre has been around in countless films including the recent [[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]] and [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]], but \\"Stake Land\\" imagines a dying society unusually plausible. Cities are trashed and terrifyingly lawless. Mister has been there and done that, a fascinating character combining the attitude of Snake Plissken ([[ASIN:B00004Y87O Escape from New York]]) with the athleticism of [[ASIN:0780624890 Blade]]. I don't know if Damici is a great actor (this is the first time I've seen his work), but he fits this Eastwood-esque role like a worn leather glove. The youthful Paolo also displays excellent presence and together, they make a sympathetic team. They're on a quest of sorts and pick up several refugees along the way, including a former nun (a barely recognizable Kelly McGillis), a pregnant teenager (Danielle Harris) and a surviving hostage of a religious cult (Sean Nelson). Oh yes, the religious cult, adorned in military gear with shaved heads. They preach the Bible and dream dictatorship.    There's quite a bit of symbolism going on here as Mister leads the way through purgatory and militaristic zealotry, including a desolate hike along a mountain trail where it appears they're being tracked by an unknown menace. What I love about these segments is the vampires become secondary and character motivations are more crucial. This great survival dynamic, akin in many ways to the almost forgotten [[ASIN:0792838041 Red Dawn]], is ruined somewhat by an unnecessary final conflict. When the menace makes its appearance, following a series derivative scenes in the clichéd abandoned warehouse, you'll say aloud, \\"And you were doing so well!\\" Anyway, the film rebounds nicely with an effective conclusion and it's telling I would actually enjoy a sequel.     Director Jim Mickle (who co-wrote the screenplay with Damici) has done a great job in creating atmosphere and detail. I have not seen his previous work [[ASIN:B0019RP6KC Mulberry Street]], evidently a similar horror excursion. But I'm going to check it out. \\"Stake Land\\" has cult film written all over it, and in this case, is deserving of such status. A great surprise.
B004V9J21O|4.0|A sequel is a tricky thing, especially in music.  It should in many respects be similar to the original work, but not TOO similar, otherwise it feels like a re-hash.  And it should add something new that the original work doesn't already offer, but the new elements shouldn't conflict too much with the original elements.<br /><br />So does Neal Morse pull it off?  Mostly.  First of all, it's technically more of a \\"midquel\\", as it expands upon events that took place during the original \\"Testimony\\" story rather than following it sequentially.  But it's still basically a \\"sequel\\" from a musical standpoint, since it borrows some musical motifs from the first installment.<br /><br />For me, that's probably where this project falters a little, simply because part of the joy in any Neal Morse album is hearing various musical motifs introduced and discovering how they develop throughout the course of the album.  You don't really get that here, because most of the recurring themes are leftovers from the original, and that's a journey we've already taken.  I certainly don't think it would've been wise to leave these themes out, though; it's just kind of an inherent issue with a sequel.<br /><br />In a way, what we have here is a progressive remix album.  Old stuff interpreted in new ways, plus new stuff.  But let's not discount the new stuff; there's plenty of it, and it's all quite good.  \\"Mercy Street\\" is particularly strong, and there's also a powerful, somber rendition of the classic hymn \\"Jesus' Blood\\".  Nothing stands out quite as being quite as memorable as \\"California Nights/Colder In The Sun\\" or \\"Wasted Life\\", but there's also a bit less filler; the original Testimony did have a few dragging points throughout its movie-like 2-disc running time.<br /><br />But let's not forget that Testimony 2 has a second disc as well.  It's technically a \\"bonus disc\\", as it only has 3 tracks, which don't relate thematically to each other or to anything on the main disc.  Of course, one of those tracks -- \\"Seeds of Gold\\" -- happens to be 25 minutes long, and is basically a Neal Morse mini-album unto itself.  The real treat, though, is \\"Supernatural\\", which is by far one of Morse's best stand-alone songs.  It's a chilling pseudo-worship song filled with memorable melodies and intricate layers of vocal harmony.  If you ever somehow find this album without the bonus disc, skip it; \\"Supernatural\\" alone makes it essential.Gold\\" -- happens to be 25 minutes long, and is basically a Neal Morse mini-album unto itself.

B004ULNJIU|3.0|The plot of the movie is contained in the title of this review.  There is a lot of action in this movie, that is for sure.  We have a typical 'hero and a villain' story.<br /><br />The story takes place in London, so it was little hard to understand the characters, but we put the subtitles on, which helped a lot.  The hero in this movie was not a likeable character.  He harasses people around him, and is obnoxious most of the movie.  In fact, the villain becomes a cop killer because he was beaten badly by the hero of the movie in the past.<br /><br />Soo, this is an OK movie to watch.  I liked 'The Mechanic' by Jason Statham much better.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|I'm sure nobody reading this needs to be told what to think of Queen's music, so I'll get to what you really want to hear about: the remasters and bonuses.<br /><br />First off, any review you may have seen about these remasters being \\"brickwalled\\" is, honestly, pretty close to a flat-out lie.  I'm not sure what these reviewers THINK they're hearing; perhaps it's some of the distortion that's present in the original recordings.  (Or perhaps they just downloaded a copy somewhere and trusted its accuracy.  Hey, I don't like throwing out wild accusations, but I'm not sure how else to explain how blatantly, factually wrong and willfully misleading some of these reviews are.)<br /><br />While I don't doubt that these masters use slightly more compression than the original discs, compression does not equal brickwalling.  Good compression is like sandpaper: it smooths out a few rough edges and bumps that really aren't desirable while still preserving the intended shape of the artwork -- perhaps even making it stand out a little more.  Bad compression, on the other hand, is like a power sander that all but eliminates the details and leaves you with a big flat block.<br /><br />These discs are clearly an example of the former.  They're louder, they're clearer, the equalization is much better -- but the \\"oldness\\" and dynamics of the sound are still intact.  You're not hearing someone else's vision of how it should sound.  And on average, these still have a lower volume than most of the other stuff in my library; I usually have to crank up the volume when they show up during random playback.<br /><br />As for the bonus discs, they're definitely pretty nice.  The majority of the bonus tracks are live versions (either from concerts or in-studio sessions), plus a handful of acapella or backing track versions, one or two B-side tracks, the A Night At The Opera re-record of \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", and a very nice-sounding brand-new mix of \\"Teo Torriatte\\".  I'm sure they could've packed the discs with more (there are 5 tracks per bonus disc on average), but I'm glad the tracks aren't awkwardly tacked onto the end of the main discs.<br /><br />The box is certainly nothing special.  It's pretty standard slipcover-quality cardboard, nice enough, but you're not missing out on anything if you don't get it.  Same goes for the fold-out poster; I'm sure there are plenty of places where you can find Queen posters.<br /><br />Really, buying this package is more about the price than anything.  It's not exactly CHEAP, but it's not that expensive either.  It's roughly $20 more than you would normally spend on 5 non-deluxe albums by just any old band on release week... and this is Queen we're talking about.  Just make sure you're not factoring the box and poster too heavily into your purchasing decision, because nobody will miss those.re 5 tracks per bonus disc on average), but I'm glad the tracks aren't awkwardly tacked onto the end of the main discs.

B0033AX20E|5.0|Valley of the Damned was my second Dragonforce CD and from what I hear on their later albums, this is the best one. I was never really cared for power metal, but Dragonforce changed that for me. If you are trying to get into power metal, I'd say get this and a CD by Rhapsody or Hammerfall.    The speed makes this album a little more unique compared to other power metal artists. Though this album is leaning a little bit on the repetitive side that doesn't make this a bad album.    For a Dragonforce fan, I give this a 5. For a Power Metal fan, I give this a 4.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is one of the best shows that I have seen by far. I recommend it to everyone and I hope they keep making it!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I've been a long time Yes fan and yes, I do miss Jon Anderson.  But I miss the 1970s Jon Anderson, at least the man that was the extraordinary-contributor-to-Yes Jon Anderson.  Today he seems still to be a great guy, and I love his spiritual ways and lyrics, but as a prog rock music composer, he is not in this league anymore.  Why can I say such heresy?  Well, remember, this is all just opinion, so don't tomato me (or should I say Tormato me -the start of Jon's downfall).  I mean really, it did start with that album and he became less and less consistent from there.  I can accept that he was the \\"spiritual\\" leader of Yes, that he wrote beautiful lyrics all the way through Magnification, but musically, meaning the \\"tunes\\", his writing has been poor at worst, inconsistent at best.    What about the new singer, Benoit David?  Well he can't write either, at least from the credits on this new Fly From Here album.  What I do like about Benoit is his range.  He can hit the highs of Jon and hit the lows of, well much lower than Jon.  To me this adds to the bands flexibility of using lyrics and voice as an instrument.  You can hear it all over the place on this album including the long Fly From Here song(s), that 21+ minute album side (old fashioned term there).    Questions remain.  I just bashed Jon's modern writing ability and the lack of Benoit's.  But what about Trevor Horn's and Geoff Downes' writing?  They're credited to have composed maybe half of this album.  Any good?  Very good?  Great?  Progressive rock or Pop rock?  Well, yes, all of this.  The standout from this duo of a team include Sad Night at the Airfield, though the whole suite of Fly From Here is quite good.  Madman at the Screens seems a bit popish at points but the same tune without Benoit's singing is spectacular in the Overture.  Another Downes/Horn composition, Life on a Film Set kind of sounds like an ABWH song to me, go figure.    Beyond Downes/Horn songs, another standout on the album is Into theStorm, a group endeavor.  I just wonder how much Oliver Wakeman contributed since he's given part credit for writing this gem.  Some songs have interesting lyrics such as Squire's The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be.  Lyrics certainly not written or sung by Jon, all Squire!  It's a little popish, but Trevor Rabin era Yes fans are not unfamiliar with pop rock, are they?  Still, well done and with a Yes sound.    Production values throughout the album by Trevor Horn make even the weaker songs sound fresh and listenable.  Hour of Need for instance sounds like a Clannad song, not really Yes, but it is OK.  I think the Japanese release of FFH does this song justice and goes in a different direction and is much more Yes like.  Why not in the American release?  Then there's Solitaire, a Steve Howe composition in the style of his other Yes solo pieces, but really it rambles a bit.  Seems technically brilliant, but would I listen to it over and over like I would Mood for a Day?    So how good is this album?  To me it's up there compared to 1970s era Yes albums and sky high from anything out today.  I find myself listening over and over, and to me that's the sign.  So if you're thirsting for a real classic sounding Yes album, don't throw out your old CDs, but do add FFH to your collection.  I'd probably rank this even a bit better than Drama, an album people seem to compare this against.  But it's different than Drama in many ways, just as it is against other Yes albums.  I definitely think FFH is better than their more modern offerings from Tormato onward.  Have to say though, Relayer, Close to the Edge, GFTO, etc., - the 1970s Jon Anderson classic era Yes is still #1.  But for 2011, it is quite honorable to be even compared to those!
1441979212|5.0|The book is aimed mainly to people who are not English mother tongue  (but I believe it would also be useful native speakers). The advice given  in the book applies to most disciplines, not just sciences.    The first part of the book is about writing techniques in general while the second part focuses in the structure of a scientific paper.  Especially useful in the second part are the paragraphs about what the Referees complains or the common mistakes based on the author's experience as a revisor of research papers. As I'm first time author I found the indications of which sections are important for inexperienced writers very useful.
0553801473|4.0|I spent more time than I should have reading one review after another. Most loved GRRM's writing but listed in graphic detail the negative aspects of his latest work. While reading this series, I've found that much of it could be loosely based on ancient and medieval history. Characters change with age or a shift in their life situations. Some children were the product of good parenting, while others could easily be the basis for a fantasy-driven version of psychotherapy. The children turn out to be the strongest and smartest of the series, those that haven't fallen to horrible deaths. Pick a ruling family from Europe during the first millennium and you'll find stories equally as horrible.<br /><br />GRRM doesn't sit at his desk and wait for his readers to advise on what to do with each character and how to develop each kingdom. He is a master at what he does and many authors of his caliber also write books of 850 to 1200 pages. They also take years between novels and we gladly wait for each of them. He stands far above the book-of-the-month writers. I've always found when reading fantasy or sci-fi, you have to jump in the deep end and let the writer take you to places you couldn't possibly imagine. It's like a leap of faith. In for a penny, in for a pound. I've loved the entire Ice and Fire series because even when the characters aren't your favorite and the plots seem to move a little slower, he's usually taking you to places he hasn't shown you yet, like in Feast. You get a taste of every kingdom and the lands beyond the narrow sea. It just happened to take him more than 5000 pages to get us to this point. And what a 5000 pages it was. I will agree with readers who complained about the extensive lists of people, their sigils, clothing and food. But I'm willing to swim in the deep end for a few thousand more pages, with an open mind.<br /><br />GRRM is the story teller, and I am in search of a fantastic diversion. After all, my time is valuable and a book-a-monthauthor has nothing to offer me.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|All told I liked the book, the story (sadly) is believable and I enjoyed the idea of the rather unusual narrative vehicle of a five-year-old's perspective.  I was kind of expecting something in the vein of say; [[ASIN:0553575619 Raptor Red]] (also good book); only I didn't exactly know what I was getting into.  I mean, I was five once too and none of his feelings or emotions really jived with my experiences of the adult world at that age. After reading some of the other reviews though, I can see that I wasn't the only one who noticed that there are some problems here.    1) Jack; the boy through whose eyes we witness everything; is very inconsistent. Most of the book I'm trying to figure out: does he really have the intellect of a retarded spider monkey or is he Rainman incarnate? I mean the kid can't even get verb tenses right while living in \\"La La Land\\" and then magically out of no where he can use some pretty big words and assimilate all kinds of knowledge while simultaneously spewing out fun factoids. An example must needs follow:     \\"Today I cutted my finger and it hurted. So I watched Dora the Explorer and touched them like real people on their TV planet which is outside Room. It was fun. Then Ma cutted the power to TV and we discussed genetic drift amongst endomorphic sea mammals from the Pacific Ocean.\\" -- NOT AN ACTUAL EXCERPT.      However the real clincher came when Jack discovered during a bath with his mother that; much to his consternation; his phallus \\"floats.\\" What popped into my mind was the voice of Pennywise: \\"They all float down here Jack-y. They all float.\\" -- If by some reason you don't know who Pennywise is you need to read Stephen King's [[ASIN:0451169514 It]]. Amazon will help you. Do it now.    2) The mother; who up until a certain point the story; was an interesting character who fights hard to provide for Jack. Then relatively early-on she becomes nothing more than an egocentric narcissistic piece of trash. She lies to Jack for four years (his whole life) and then unloads on him everything but the kitchen sink. Then abandoning all thought of the little boy in their new world after such devotion is irrevocably detrimental to any sympathy that she had gained as a character up to this point. What a moron.    3) Due to the choice in point-of-view taken, we lose a lot of interesting bits of story that I think would have fared really well. The Grandmother, the Grandfather, Old Nick, how the journey to the Room transpired. None of this though is covered. I think the whole thing would have been better if we could have experienced some things with Ma juxtaposed with Jack.     Anyway enough rambling, I really liked the idea of the story and those ideas were original. I would recommend it and it's a quick read.
0061537934|5.0|I was unsure I would like this book - I'm more of a cat person - but it sucked me in from the beginning. What a great story told from a dog's perspective yet quite human. Enzo is near the end of his life and reflects on the journey he has taken, and that of the family he lived with, to tell a story that is at times tragic and alternately heart warming. Always full of love and compassion for those he shares his life with. . . Great book.

B0010X8NF0|1.0|I really tried hard to like this movie, but I could not.  The movie was set in India but it was clear that the writers had absolutely no idea of what India was, and kept writing in stuff that was completely inconsistent with the culture of the people.  Ignorance is forgivable, but it is clear that the writers made no attempt to understand the subject.  Furthermore since the movie was filmed in India, I am sure that there had to have been countless comments from the Indians involved in the production as to the implausibility of many of the situations.  It begins with the brief sexual encounter with Rita.  This was certainly possible but highly implausible.  One of the most striking was the scene with the obviously conservative Sikh (evidenced by the turban and other attributes of his religion), having a relationship with a Hindu girl (shown by the prominent  bindi with no kara - bracelet kara) smoking a cigarette.  (Tobacco is prohibited among Sikhs.)  A cinematic statement as bold as this one demanded some type of exposition, yet none came.  I could only suppose that this was the result of complete ignorance.  The move continues to move along without any clear direction and merely uses India in an incredibly awkward fashion as a backdrop for this poorly conceived tale.<br /><br />But as bad as Darjeeling Limited was, it stood out as a comedic masterpiece compared with its prequel, Hotel Chevalier.  This was a plodding piece that served no function other than to waste our time.  In revealed very little about the characters and absolutely nothing which was relevant to the main film.<br /><br />The whole film reminded me of an unfunny, Bob Hope Bing Crosby \\"Road to New Delhi\\", except none of the characters were funny, nor were they capable of engaging the audience in any capacity whatsoever.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|I appreciated the fact that, unlike about every other western made in last ten years, this one was not PC!  With one exception, there were no \\"fast draws\\"; the use of firearms seemed unusually realistic.  The sets, clothing and horses seemed to be period realistic.

1451629184|4.0|This book by Jaycee Dugard was written well from my perspective given that she only had a fifth grade education.  She was captured by a sexual predator (Phillip Garridos) and his wife Nancy at the tender age of 11.  Philip abused her physically and emotionally for 18 years.  Jaycee is a wonderful person to have had the attitude and feelings that she experienced during her years of captivity.  She got used to the life in captivity and as time went on, she would have liked to escape but would not ever risk it with her capturer, Phillip. Of course, she hoped someone would notice her and let her go back to a normal life. But at the same time, Jaycee felt that as long as she stayed with Phillip Garridos she would spare someone else the hell that she was enduring.  There were parts that I did have to skip over as they were so horrible to read, never mind experience. This was a very sad and unimaginable story. It is a story that you do not want to read over a long period of time. It is a quick read due to the nature of the story.

Mister Personality he ain't.<br /><br />These performances of Mozart's violin concertos might be ideologically sound (bulges in the melodic line, eschewal of overt romanticism and clipped phrasing) but they are sterile and unmemorable. Any concertmaster in the antipodes could mirror the virtuosity of the soloist - in his grim determination to tick all the period-practice boxes, Carmignola forgets to demonstrate that he has something to say in a congested field. The Third Concerto in particular is bloodless.<br /><br />The Sinfonia Concertante - one of the greatest creations of Western Civilisation - is miniaturised in their hands. It's indictable.<br /><br />Productions such as these are typical of the cash-strapped Deutsche Grammophon of today: use a scratch orchestra and record them in live concerts; to make it all seem legit, throw in a well-known, fly-in conductor. If soloists are involved, they must be photogenic. Yep, it's as phony as they come.<br /><br />To even think that this cycle comes anywhere near the musicality of Grumiaux is to laugh [[ASIN:B000004166 Mozart: Violin Concertos (Complete)]]. And dare one mention Oistrakh with the Berlin Philharmonic in K 364? [[ASIN:B00000DOJD Mozart: Sinfonia Concertante, KV 364 in E Flat Major, Concertone KV 190 in C Major, Adagio KV 261, Rondo KV 269]]<br /><br />If you must have period-practice, there is always the Standage [[ASIN:B0000042HR Mozart: Violin Concertos]] or the Huggett [[ASIN:B00000J2Q2 Mozart: Violin Concertos]]. In both instances, you know what you're getting.<br /><br />Oh, hear the wolves howl!h, hear the wolves howl!
B004WCTLNY|3.0|Based on the novella `The Adjustment Team' by Philip K.Dick,filmed by director George Nolti,who wrote The Bourne Ultimatum and Oceans 12,starring Matt Damon.Nolti retains only the central conceit of our world being shepherded along by agents of a grand plan,bolstering it with a love story to heighten the stakes of the conflict between predetermination and free will.Matt Damon's ambitious politician David Norris learn of the Adjustment Bureau's grip on mankind's every move(storm troopers in trilby hats),he faces losing the love of his life(Emily Blunt)if he is to  pursue his path to the presidency.The mysterious Judeo-Christian forces are detemined to keep them apart.There is a link with Paycheck,where a couple go on the run after falling in love,and are threatened with having their brains wiped.The main weaknesses are the flimsy conceptual machinations whereby the love story becomes the films driving force,due to the adhoc nature of the Bureau's operational procedures:unable to keep tabs on humans near water and the network of secret passages the Bureau uses can only be negotiated wearing a hat,and turning the door handles clockwise.    Anthony Mackie acts as the conscience -racked agent,Terence Stamp weighs in with a history of mankind's failings when the celestial stabilisers have been taken off.The film lacks visceral punch and texture.What works is the chemistry of the central couple Blunt and Damon as this becomes an essentially light-hearted romance whereby a single kiss has prompted the Bureau to rewrite the plan.David and Elise's freewill is restored;perhaps mankind will follow.This is Nolti's debut.

B00007KWHN|4.0|THIS ALBUM GOT A BADLY NEEDED REMASTERING.  BONUS TRACKS ARE A WASTE, EXCEPT FOR THE CLAP.    This is Yes's third album, but the start of the classic Yes sound. I think that is also Yes's first focused album.    The original album was 40 minutes long.  With the bonus tracks, it is about 50 minutes long.  The first bonus tracks are worthless...just truncated, single versions of the longer original tunes.  I hate when they do this.  I just heard the nice original version.  I don't want to follow it up with a butchered version.    The other bonus track is a studio version of The Clap.  I like this version much better than the live version they put on the original album.    Until now, there has never been a really good sounding version of this album.  Atlanta Records always put out inferior vinyl, with lots of pops and sometimes hissing.  All the original Yes CDs had horrible sound.  It is just amazing that it took so long to get a remastered version with good sound quality.      This CD comes with an 8 page booklet that has the original artwork and one of those stupid album descriptions where the writer talks about how this is the best band in the world....Yours Is No Disgrace is a comment on the Viet Nam War....really?????    Like many fans, I got into Yes at Fragile (the 4th album).  I then went out and got the first three albums.  I really loved this album back then.  But, when I play it now I don't like it as much.  And the reason is that I have been spoiled by the versions of these songs that are on Yessongs.  It seems like they greatly improved the songs as they played them live over the next 2 years.  It is not just the jamming and the extended versions.  The songs are played with much more energy on Yessongs.   And, although I'm not a huge Wakeman fan, he probably does add more to the songs to make them more enjoyable.    The only song this album not covered on Yessongs is The Venture.  This sounds like a song that could go on the first two albums.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I am a huge Nikon CLS (Creative Lighting System) user.  I shoot with a Nikon D300s, MBD10 Grip, 2 SB-900's, 2 SB-700's, Pocket Wizards, full line of Nikon lenses, clamps, etc...  I photograph by the two L's: Light and Lens; light being the most important element.  This is where Nikon Speedlights excel and the SB-700 is the perfect companion / compliment to the SB-900.<br /><br />The SB-900 is a very large high-powered flash.  In fact, I was surprised when I first opened the box and soon came to learn it could be a pain to pack when I went light (as in weight).  The SB-700 was a welcome sight since, at times, extreme portability matters. In short, I was looking for slightly less power than the SB-900, just in a smaller package.  I considered any other features (such as commander mode) to be a bonus.  This was on the heels of just purchasing two SB-600's (later sold on EBay), which I found counter intuitive due to the menu system and need to press multiple buttons at the same time to adjust settings.  Plus, the light output from my SB-600's seemed a little harsh and warm in the center.<br /><br />The SB-700 is functionally the same as the SB-900. If you learn the SB-900, you know the SB-700.  I measured power output of the SB-700 (92 feet spec) at less than the SB-900 (131 feet spec) and greater than the SB-600 (though specs say it should be a little less at 92 feet versus the SB-600 98 feet). Essentially, I use my SB-900's as key light(s) in most situations.  So, it not only is a great compliment to an SB-900 but also a suitable replacement (in lieu of) for the SB-900 if you are on a budget.  In fact, I judge the SB-900 to be overkill unless you are a semi-pro or pro photographer.<br /><br />The on-board flash controls are simply incredible.  I also find the LCD screen far better than the screen on the SB-600 or even the SB-800 (old Nikon flagship flash).  The flash is easy to adjust on the move and very intuitive. Build quality is what you expect from Nikon, which is very good to great, though I am a little concerned about the battery door.  But, unless you are juggling your flashes, I do not seen anything to worry about.  Plus, the SB-700 comes with a built in bounce card (needed by the way) whereas the SB-600 did not.  Additionally, with the SB-700 you get filters, a decent case, diffusion dome, and stand.<br /><br />Word on the dreaded \\"thermal issue.\\"  The SB-900 contained a thermal shutdown feature to prevent the user from essentially melting the flash.  The SB-700 will instead slow down recycle time to about 3.5 seconds compared to the rated 2.5 to control the temp.  Trust me- most people will never encounter this situation unless they try.  It's just something not worrying about.  Therefore, this would be a great 2nd flash for advanced shooters and great first/primary flash for beginners to intermediate shooters.  But, I do agree with Ken Rockwell that most users who buy non-professional (consumer grade) DSLR bodies could easily go with an SB-400 flash.  So, if you are in this category, you may be able to save a few hundred dollars and get everything you need.  If you decide to upgrade later, your equipment is scaleable and resell-able (Nikon gear retains value very well).h is very good to great, though I am a little concerned about the battery door.

B004H1V5RU|2.0|Going from ramp 12 to 13 the ramps don't line up, the pins is not aligned in the slot. This is the second one of these toys we've purchased and both had the same problem. There is obviously some kind of manufacturing defect, I find it hard to believe both broke in shipment in the same spot. One was purchased here, the other from a local 'elite' toy shop.<br /><br />Read the other reviews... yes my son liked it and was very challenged by it, but when you can't even do part of it because it's broken it's obviously a waste. Buyer beware... don't want your kids opening a broken toy on xmas or his/her birthday! Would have given it 4-5 stars if it actually worked.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I went to see the new film The Tree of Life this week. I was very excited since the film was just screened at Cannes and here I was seeing the same film here in Sacramento a few days later. Of course I also heard that the audience boo'd the film at the end which is very much not typical for the Cannes Film festival. The last time I remember hearing something like that was when they showed Marie Antoinette at the Venice Film Festival. In the case of Marie Antoinette the audience was right, yet a repeat was not making me turn back. I was seeing this movie and that was that.    When i arrived at the theatre there were only five other critics there and we were all looking forward to the film even though we all had heard about the screening at Cannes. The movie starts out very mysteriously with an out of focus shot that almost looks like a child's fort under a bed sheet with a mumbled whispering going on all around us. At this point the movie just lost me. The film is not linear so what appears to be a storyline just becomes random shots of this family on any given day. At one point the mother in the film gets a telegram telling her one of her sons in dead ... I don't know which one nor at this point do I care. Sean Penn comes on screen as one of the brothers grown up and he mumbles something about his brother being dead (which had to have happen 30 years prior) and then he does a lot of aimless staring. All of a sudden he's on a beach ... there is a door. He walks through it and at that point we see what had to have been at least 30 minutes of the creation. Planets and suns being born in a cosmic opera ... at this point I'm really fighting sleep. The music and the darkness in the theatre mixed with my complete confusion made shut down. If it weren't for me thinking about getting lunch I probably would have had about a two hour nap.    When we came back from the Hubble telescope free for all we got more boring moments in this families life for what felt like hours. I'm not really sure what this thing was about and i don't care. I've read other critics thoughts on this and many are glowing on what a master filmmaker Terrence Malik is but I don't see it. I'm not a fan of any of his previous work and after my torturous afternoon, I never will be. I can't come up with any BS about how he toys with our imagination and that's why he's a genesis ... I have to go the way of the Emperor's New Clothes. I can't fake praise for this film. I can't pull some clever comments out of my ass to make it sound like I felt his art. I have to call it for what it is ... a turd. A big smelly turd.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Burlesque is a extremely enjoyable movie. While some may liken it to a musical, it is not a standard musical by any means. Although the base storyline may be somewhat familiar, it has an edgy undertone storyline. This all-star cast gives excellent acting, humor, along with outstanding vocal and dance performances. Cher proves that her voice is still unique and strong. Christina Aguilera's voice is so strong and clear that it's a showcase for her voice. The costumes are beautiful and amazing. Since I purchased this DVD, I have watched it more than two dozen times. I never tire of the songs, dances, and humor. There are scenes in this movie that will touch your heart and other scenes that will make you laugh. An all around great picture; it's been too long since a movie was made that can be called \\"pure entertainment\\". This one is it.

I wanted to hear her side of why she stayed in the situation when she became old enough to make the decision to get away. This is not an emotionally easy book to read, but well worth the truth and healing that comes with it. That an eleven year old child was subjected to such a life is impossible to understand. But the author tells it the way it was and it is an unforgettable read.

B0043XQ1TE|5.0|When I first purchased this album I didn't think much of it but then the more I listened to it the more I couldn't stop listening to it. I first heard of Deerhunter when I got \\"Helicopter\\" for free on Spin's free monthly songs they give away every month. I liked it and listened to every once and awhile. Then I saw Deerhunter on Conan and they played \\"Helicopter\\" and I thought it sounded familiar and I forgot I had it on my Ipod. So one day I see that the albums on sale here on Amazon and I took a chance and bought it. Let me tell you it's the best thing I ever did. Deerhunter is much more than just \\"Helicopter\\". \\"Memory Boy\\", \\"Fountain Stairs\\" and \\"He Would Have Laughed\\" are some of my favorites but the whole albums amazing. I really like Deerhunters lyrics and how easily I can relate to them. This album easily gets 5 stars. Also I can't stop watching Deerhunter videos on Youtube there that amazing. Bradford Cox is a very interesting individual.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Centurion is an interesting film about Roman Times in Britain. Like the U S Cavalry in the West with the Native Americans, the Romans had to deal with people they thought very little of, often in a brutal manner. Perhaps the film could have been edited better, as sometimes there seemed t be gaps in the narrative. But all in all, a rousing sometimes terrifying look at ambition and bloody mindedness in ancient Britain.    Conveniently bought from Amazon which seems to have titles hard to find.

B005BZQVJ8|1.0|Stupid.           Waist of comedic energy. When one group repeatedly makes fun of another group its called abusive and marginalizing that group. Like whites did in the past to blacks and every other group, so the story goes. Typical to atheist `liberal' hollywood, they have theatrically assaulted and insulted anyone who excepts the existence of God, a religion, and a possible creation theory. Even Steven Hawkins admits to worm holes in space and time...in which supernature or spiritual travel could trek. But hey, comedy is at its best when it weaves a strong yarn to spin a funny story which makes fun of every human, and not sparing anyone or preaching the perceptions which comes from a bias political agenda or a meaningless existential faith `science'. `Shawn of the Dead' should have died in London because he and his evolving alien movie died. Smoke a big one and light some incense with candles because this movie won't reincarnate or evolutionarily be able to be brought back from the dead, like Paul the alien did in the film.

B0001US62I|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and never get tired of watching. Out of all \\"The Devil Made Me Do It\\" based thrillers, I think this movie is the best. The fact the movie is set in New Orleans, a city rich in the occult, adds volumes to the story. But when you add Robert De Niro into the mix as the rich benefactor with an elusive secret, you get next to perfect. All the characters come together so well to give an outstanding performance about a man's search and ultimate fight for his soul. If you love a challenge and this movie does not draw you in, then I would be pressed to recommend a movie that would. And to add more intrigue, sex and excitement, the scene between Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet will surely cover that aspect.
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book to read for two reasons - the movie is coming out and my kids are interested in reading it.  I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Let me just say I could not put it down.  I read it within 48 hours.  It was so engaging.  I read many reviews and a few said that it was brutal - I totally disagree.  It's hard for me to find a book I like - this one captured me with in the first four pages.  I just downloaded book #2 - now you know what I will be doing for the next 48 hours :)  Get it, you will love it!
0071762345|5.0|I am a nationally recognized professor, who has won awards for online learning/instructional technology. Ironically, I fell completely behind the social media wave, and as a communication educator, deliberately resisted it due to watching my students' face-to-face communication skills sadly denigrate.     I started writing a book about students and their communication skills. . . then I realized I was REALLY behind if I want my message to actually reach masses of students. I felt confused over how to both reach students through a Facebook fan page, and then engage them to interact with the content (Years of classroom teaching tell me that getting college students to speak up, ask for help, etc. can be difficult!).     Enter Likeable Social Media, spiritedly recommended by a friend who had just purchased it, read it, and was adapting the recommendations--with rapid results for his tutoring business. I, too, dove into the book and was impressed by how conversationally do-able the ideas seemed. The tips regarding Facebook reach and engagement are ones I feel confident I can follow.     What struck me more than anything, however, is Dave Kerpen's astute knowing that people benefit from being \\"told\\" and \\"shown\\" how to complete a task. What is the \\"show\\" Kerpen delivers? Soft skills in addition to the doable recommendations--and who doesn't need a refresher on those?      Kerpen offers the reader the EXACT words to become likeable... He gives phrases and examples that one can use to appreciate or apologize in a number of customer-related situations. As an educator, I tell students what to do, give them examples, but they often still find themselves perplexed by the \\"how\\". Likeable Social Media answers the \\"how\\" brilliantly.     I have had the book in my hand less than a week and I find myself weaving it into conversations with others. I am going to recommend it to a running shoe store owner who just gave poor customer service to a good friend of mine (but has a very different persona on his Facebook fan page), and particularly to other profs who are writing trade books like I am and trying to reach others through social media.     Whether selling a service, idea, product, or just trying to make connections, I would absolutely recommend this book to any person who wants to reach others in a truly meaningful, relational way.

B00005M08C|4.0|Gorillaz are an experimental group from the U.K., also known as a virtual band for their use of cartoon characters in their videos and on their website which is perhaps the best way to experience the group outside of attending a concert.  This is their self-titled debut which was originally released on March 26th of 2001.  The album did very well, reaching the top ten in the U.K., and the top 20 in the U.S. and Canada. The group draws from pretty much any and all genres, as there are hints of punk, reggae, hip-hop, rack, and more in the 17 tracks on this U.K. Re-Issue which includes two different remix tracks on the end, replacing the hidden version of \\"Clint Eastwood\\" which closed out the original CD.    This album is a stretch for my own personal musical tastes, but I do appreciate their innovation and vision.  The songs tend to be a bit repetitive to my tastes, but they do have an interesting blend of styles and create an almost hypnotic sound which keeps the listener not just interested, but entranced and absorbed by the music.  Included are 17 pieces and over 64 minutes of music.  Four singles were released from the album including \\"Clint Eastwood, \\"19-2000\\", \\"Rock the House\\", and \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\".  It also comes as no surprise that a group like this would produce an enhanced CD, nor that they would make it a great multimedia experience with animation and music and sounds, along with links to other sites which may be of interest.    The creative force behind the group is Damon Albarn who was the lead singer of Blur and has also been a solo artist, and who teamed up with comic book artist Jamie Hewlett to create the virtual group.  The members of the virtual band are 2D (lead vocals, keyboard, piano), Noodle (guitar, backing vocals), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion), and there is a guest on this album, Del the Ghost Rapper (vocals).  The non-virtual people involved include Damon Albarn (vocals), Del tha FUnkee Homosapien (guest vocals), Ibrahim Ferrer (guest vocals), and Miho Hatori (backing vocals, guitar).  In addition, Tina Weymouth apparently provided some backing vocals.     Gorillaz is a unique group, and their debut album is a good place to start when it comes to learning about the group and their unusual presentation and style.  This album grows on me every time I listen to it, and at this point it feels like a 4-star album, but I may change my mind in the future regarding that rating.

B00004RFFW|5.0|I don't know why but I always seem to like sequels over the 1st. Lethal Weapon of course was a suprise hit & the sequel is my favorite of the series. Released in 1989 directed by Richard Donner again. Mel Gibson returns as Martin Riggs Danny Glover returns as Roger Murtaugh. Also stars Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, Joss Ackland as Adrien Rudd & Patsey Kensit as Rika van den Hass. Movie starts off with a car chase with Riggs & Murtaugh. The guys they are after crash into a store or something they fled the cops find a Krugerrand Riggs & Murtaugh are at there usual giving each other s h         it Murtaugh's daughter is going to be in a commercial & Riggs tells the whole force. It turns out that it is a con    dom commercial. Which later in the movie the cops give Murtaugh a tree with Con   doms. Some of the South African consulate guys break into Murtaugh's house & threaten him he reloctes the family while he can continue with the case. Riggs & Murtaugh have to protect a federal witness Leo Getz. An assassin for Adrien Rudd is going to try to kill Leo Getz Riggs knocks the assassin out a window & all 3 fall out the window into the pool Riggs kills the assassin. Getz tells them about the house outside of LA with stilts. They check it out Riggs poses as a pool boy he is confronted by these 2 hechies Riggs takes care of business hand   cuffs them. Then you have an awesome chase scene Riggs goes after this guy who fled & stloe a tow truck he wrecks & a surf board goes through the window & he died by a surf board through a winshield. They go back to arrest the others but Adrien Rudd shows up & his right hand man knows about Riggs. Rudd invokes his Diplomatic Immununity. He tells Riggs that you couldn't even give me a parking ticket. Then we are introduced to Rika van den Hass which becomes a love intrest for Riggs. Riggs follows Adrien Rudd around when he pulls out of the drive way Riggs pulls right in front of him almost causes a wreck smiles & waves he goes to the building thathe works in & he's on camera smiles & waves there are these people outside protesting cause of what's going on in South Africa. Riggs needs to get into the building then you have a hilarous scene where Leo Getz goes into an office & tells a embassy worker that he wants him to talk his friend out of going to South Africa when Murtaugh comes in the guy at table says but you're bl   ac   k.

That allows Riggs to get in he goes straight for Rudds office he tells them that he will take them down he shoots the fish tank he sees Rika again he tells her about it she laughs about it cause she hates her boss & her countries policies. Rudd orders his men to kill the cops Riggs & Rika fall for each other I can buy  their relationship. You have the classic bomb on the toilet scene. Murtaugh goes through some old home movies to find out about a ship called the Alba Varden which takes drugs to Cape Town & he told Leo Getz to stay in the car 2 of Rudd's henchies steal the car & take Leo with them. Murtaugh is attacked & he takes a nail gun & owns the attacker he's grabbed from behind but he is owned too. Riggs trailer comes under attack he manages to get Rika to safty. He kills some of the henchies & they get out of there. He takes Rika back to her apartment she tells him that he can stay with her Riggs tells her to quit her job there are other ways of staying in LA. Then when he's going back to his truck he's knocked out & he's taken to Los Angeles Harbor where Rudd's right hand man tells him 4 years ago you were closing in on Rudd he was contracted to kill him but the car had his wife in it & he confesses to killing her. He's thrown into the harbor he sees that Rika has been drowned which he is just pi   s     s     ed off. he gets out of there snaps this guys neck takes another guy repeatidly bashes his head on a car door. Martin Riggs is LW 1 Riggs again he calls Murtaugh he tells him that they killed them they killed them both. Murtaugh tries to calm him down Riggs tells him \\" Tonight I'm not a cop tonight it's personal!\\" Riggs meets up with Murtaugh at the house with the stilts Murtaugh goes in kills some bad guys get Leo out of there Riggs tears the house down with his G    M      C pick up ( back when G    M ment something0 OWNAGE!

Riggs has knife stuck in the back of his leg he pulls it out he could kill the guy there but Riggs drops a cargo container on to the guy OWNAGE! Rudd shoots Riggs several times & he yells \\"Diplomatic Immunity!\\" In what is a classic scene Murtaugh shoots him in the head & says \\" It's just been revoked!\\" Great use of knocking on heavens door. Riggs tells him to throw the cigarettes away they'll kill you. Lethal Weapon 2 is an awesome sequel I love this movie. Richard Donner did a great job. Mel Gibson was great this is my of all 4 movies part 2 had my favortite Riggs. Joe Pesci was funny he did a good job. Patsey Kensit was good you felt bad what happend to her. Joss Acklund was good as the villain. There was conterversy with Shane Black he wanted to kill off Riggs & the studio walked away which this is 1 of the few times I will take the studio side. So if you haven't ever seen LW 1 or 2 definity see them next I'll review LW 3.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry's getting older, Voldemort's getting bolder, things are getting tougher and more dangerous, and the only chance the good guys have of surviving is to play for keeps. Sometimes the situation dictates the response, and Harry and friends have to decide just how far they will go to defeat pure evil and perhaps even survive it! Exciting, great writing (thank you, JK AND the script writers!), a thrill a minute - no kiddie fare here, just a great ride! Can't wait until the final episode!!!

0439023521|2.0|The intrinsic horror of the Hunger Games has been reviewed by other readers.  Yes, it is sick and awful that kids are forced to kill each other and that it is televised, but when you stand back and look at the book in a detached way, it's really rather ridiculous.  The world building just doesn't make sense.    First of all, the reason given for the Capitol's stranglehold on the Districts is that there are no resources.  Everyone is starving.  The sea has covered the land.  The environment has gone to hell.  People are so desperate that they're throwing their kids into the pot as human sacrifices.  And they're mining coal.    Repeat: THEY'RE MINING COAL.  If resources are so scare, how is there any coal to mine?  If things are that bad, the coal should be long gone.  Plus, our heroine hunts outside the fence in what appears to be a thriving ecosystem: plenty of predators, prey, virgin forest and clean water.  Isn't the environment supposed to be wiped out?  Speaking of which, if things are so bad on the inside of the fence and so good on the outside, why hasn't everyone--or, at least, some--escaped the Districts and set up an alternative society in the forest?    The Capitol seems to have some serious technological advantages, and it better had, because in real life, the nation of Panem would be under constant attack.  Other countries seem strangely absent in this version of the future, which is plain odd, but I guess it's a good thing, since other countries would have seen Panem as a weak target long ago and attacked it.  If resources are scarce, people fight over them; and Panem is wasting tons of its resources by sinking them into the pointless Hunger Games EVERY YEAR.  Every SINGLE year, they are spending the equivalent of millions of dollars on terrorizing their citizens, creating the Arena and making zombie werewolves (seriously).  The Hunger Games do nothing to stimulate any part of the economy but reality TV; they do nothing to defend the country.  The ONLYpurpose they serve is entertainment and terrorism.  Any other country, in a world as brutal as Collins', would have long ago ransacked Panem, which, spending all its resources on state terror, would be unable to fight back.  In real life, Panem would not be wasting valuable soldiers on gladiatorial fights, not when they could be shipping them off to defend the borders.     The sheer emotional horror of this book is good, and, I know, the main point.  But the world makes no sense when you leave your fantasy of the Ultimate Evil Reality TV Show and take a long, hard look at it.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I am not satisfied at all. I was expecting there to be two disc and there was only one, which is double sided. I would much rather have two disc, but the description of this dvd clearly does not say that there is only one disc. And there isn't even anything special about either of them. I am highly dissatisfied. I would not buy this if you are looking for a two disc combo.
B003Y5H5FG|2.0|A modern remake told in a slightly different way but its the same old story, charlie watches next door neighbor through his window in suspicion that something isn't quite right, with all the missing students in class everyday. Eventually he discovers he is a vampire and his girlfriend is the next victim, so he recruits peter vincent to hunt down and kill the vampire. Had some interesting ideas, but what hurts the movie is its crude dialogue and over use of the F word and whatever else spoken obsanity thats written for a teenage audience, its unnessary. Peter Vincent isn't likeable and its disrespectful towards Roddy Mcdowalls original performance. Evil Ed had the worst performance and dialogue, Colin Farrell is the strongest performance and what made the movie. Overall there wasn't much originality to this remake, Its an okay movie but the original is alot better.

B000H2NA30|5.0|Read this book when you're alone, the wind around you drowning out the world, the sunlight and air isolating your mind so that it will only be you and Edith, you and her story. So you can feel who she is and where she went with all the realness of being there.<br /><br />It will be well worth it. It certainly was for me.<br /><br />Firstly, I must mention that I love personal stories, that I love experiencing other people's lives, and that I forgive most failures in storytelling because I know a real person had made it, not necessarily a professional writer, and most certainly not a professional writer creating a fictional tale that can be so easily modified for irony and suspense. That being said, I love Edith's story. I find her experiences moving, sad, hopeful, and deep. I seem to forever be searching for a word that conveys the depth and danger, interest and didacticism, sadness and optimism that I find in the best stories. I would describe Edith's memoirs with that word.<br /><br />Similarly, I cannot say I enjoyed the story, for in it there was much sadness and fear. I cannot say I was fascinated and interested, for there was much more than those shallow, impersonal pleasures. I can say I was moved, but there was also so much more. There was learning, feeling, hoping, and crying.<br /><br />Edith explains her life from her childhood to her trials during World War II. She lays down the most intimate details of her life, unedited, to give us a whole and perfect image of her personality, her dreams, and her life longings. Through her details, we come to know her as a real person and we come to understand everything she does and to feel those same emotions that she did throughout her ordeal. We can feel both her tortures and her triumphs intimately.<br /><br />About the writing style: At first, it made me pause. Edith occasionally addresses the reader in the second person. But I think in the end, this is not a factor in the quality of the storytelling. In fact, it can be a great aid in bringing her closer to you, in making her story that much more personal.<br /><br />Besides this, the narrative style is perfect. The emotions of real life are recreated with as much storytelling devices as real life can maintain. Scenes and dialogue are recreated with a perfect balance of immediacy and summary.<br /><br />And on its title: Some may wonder why her book is titled the way it is, without her being the wife of a Nazi officer except for a short time in the story. But I think no word could describe a person wholly through life and that something must be used to symbolize the story presented. \\"The Nazi Officer's Wife\\" fulfills this latter reason. In her incredible experience, Edith had to live a life like the rest of the Nazis. She had to pretend to be someone she was not, pretend to be a Nazi. In many ways, she was wedded to this lie, this incredible lie of agreement with monsters. This is how the title symbolizes her struggle.<br /><br />What an incredible book, an incredible story, an incredible woman.er to you, in making her story that much more personal.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|Amazing new CD from music pioneers \\"Yes\\". Fly From Here is the first new album in 10 years. Since 2001's Magnification which certainly had some fantastic moments but also had some of Yes's lowest moments. Well I am happy to say after repeated listening I can finally make an honest review. I will start by saying that this is the first Yes cd in years that just I keep playing over and over again. Like all of my favorite Yes albums they grow on you as you learn the nuances of the songs . There is way too much going on to hear it in one or two listens. I don't care what anyone says about that fact. Upon repeated listening this cd reveals itself as true amazing Yes music.....<br />Trevor Horn produced or over saw the production of this and in the process wrote 50% of the music. He is a very prolific song writer IMO. These compositions on FFH by Horn are out takes from the Drama days and songs he and Downs wrote for Yes in the Buggles era. I had previously listened to all these songs as demos from the Buggles sessions and always thought...Man, these songs would be incredible if Yes recorded them. Well I can't believe it but they now have. Thank you Trevor Horn for bringing Yes out of the dark again. This is definitely the bands best effort in years.It also is the best sounding recording of Yes  which is typical of Horn, every instrument and musical moment is clear and dynamic. Top notch production.  Despite the fact that Jon Anderson is not the lead singer/guru, the music lacks nothing in the vocal department. This album is full of beautiful lush vocal work. Benoit David stands his ground as the lead singer. He sounds like himself then at times reminiscent of Horn and there are plenty of moments when you swear you can hear Anderson in the Harmonies or that \\"Yes\\" sound so to speak. Chris Squire is equally great on his vocal work as well and his bass playing sounds amazing. He really came up with some classic bass hooks throughout the whole cd. What can you say about Steve Howe? He is what makes this music exciting for me.He is always on the edge with his lead guitar fills. Still creating that dark or heavenly sound with his slide or strumming and picking on the acoustics. He does it all here in fine fashion. Alan White may appear to be doing less than the rest but like Ringo was in the Beatles, Alan is to Yes. He plays the song. It is almost magical because he makes it sound so easy and it really isn't. He certainly is a seasoned pro behind the drum kit. He gets a great blend of acoustic drums and triggered percussion. He is rock solid throughout. Enter Geoff Downs. Geoff is the glue to this whole cd pretty much. He lays it down with lush, full, spacial soundscapes like a bed for Squire, White and Howe to lay down in. Sometimes he reminds me of Vangelis if that makes sense. But over all Downs part is big and present. Oliver Wakeman gets credit for playing keyboards on  We Can Fly and Hour Of Need. Yey Oliver. A good keyboard player and a good man.<br />Now the songs....<br />1.Overture.....a classic way to begin any Yes album. I liked it iright from the start. And it set up a brief compact introduction of what was to come in many ways. This is classic sounding Yes to me.<br />2. We Can Fly.......Heard it years back and can only say wow. They really made it sound fresh and most importantly, it sounds like Yes. What a great song to debut or introduce Benoit David. Everyone is rock solid but Howe is especially noted on lead guitar through out.<br />3. Sad Night At The Airfield......Wow...Steve howe plays acoustic guitar so sweet and beautiful and the vocal work that follows is just unreal. Anyone want to argue that this isn't Yes music still? This is the first stand out on the cd for most people.<br />4. Madman at the Screens.....This song has the classic mix of Buggles and Yes imo....Once you start to really hear it you realise just how rocking and pulsating the groove is. Killer bass by Squire start to finish. White rocks hard and steady. in great support.<br />5. Bumpy Ride.....this is a quirky little piece that seems to be edited in out of no where.The only wierd part of the album.  It has that Torrmato era thing going on but it seems to be abrupt to the flow and equally jarring as it segues back into<br /> 6. We Can Fly Reprise....Just what it says it's a reprise of song #2...now we get to song #<br />7. The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be.......At first listen I was thinking oh this is different. Squire sings the lead on the first verse.The chorus and following verses are sung in harmony where Benoit sounds the most like Anderson to me. It is one of those songs that grows on you especially the last 2 minute section where they are singing in classic Yes harmony EEya EEya EEya EEya EEya over this Beatlesque acoustic guitar strumming. Squire is holding it down with a classic bass liine hook and then Howe solos away in counterpoint like we haven't heard in ages. Almost sounds like the going for the one era maybe. A real high point for me after many listens now.<br />8. Life On A Film Set......OMG this song is just simply amazing. It has Alan whites best drumming on the album and it is complex in signature and moving at a quick tempo. Benoits vocals are just awesome on this song. Very Yes/Buggles sounding music. This is one of Horns songs that I always wanted to here yes do and they just nailed it. Wow what a tune.<br />9. Hour Of Need......A cool little acoustic tune where Mr Howe plays his Portuguese folk guitar. It is a nice break from the other songs and features some great vintage synth lines from Oliver Wakeman. Once again the vocals sound like classic Yes that any Yes fan would certainly like. The Japanese import has an extended version of this song which has an extensive instrumental intro and outro with some of Alan Whites most featured drum fills and great soloing from Howe. I can't figure out why they left it off the cd..<br />10. Solitaire...A great happy, hoppy little solo piece from Steve in much the same vein as Mood For A Day or The Clap. It is a clever arrangement with all the Howe trademarks. Really enjoyable.<br />11. Into The Storm.........What a perfect song to end the album. This is classic Yes like Release or Tempus Fugit. It is rocking hard and fast from the start. There are some cool synth parts as well as raunchy guitar riffs all filled out with great vocals. Once again if you close your eyes you can hear Jon in there. Sounds like Yes to me. Halfway through this turns into a sound scape where Steve Howe plays some blazing guitar until the end lands us back to where we just flew from.............<br />A truly great album from one of the truly great bands of our time. Too bad for the personal politics and problems they have had over the years. It is too bad that Jon wasn't singing on this. I said that about Drama too. At least we still have Yes around to enjoy and hear new music from after 40 years of playing together in one incarnation or another.<br />As ex Yes member Billy Sherwood quoted on facebook..... \\"Yes is an amazing band with amazing people and politics. Things are not always what they seem. On with the show......<br />I couldn't agree more............Get Fly From Here and .......Fly..............5.

B001GCUO52|2.0|3 / 10<br /><br />The other day I bought the collection of Final Destination 1-4 because I've only saw numbers 2 & 3 previously. I liked 1 and 2, 3 was ok at best, and 4 was unwatchable.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was the bizarre choice of cast. One of the main characters seemed to be a half-hearted attempt to create a comic relief. Its like putting an American Pie character into a horror film, just doesn't work. And the acting in general is horrible compared to previous films. It was horrible compared to any film really......<br /><br />Second thing I noticed is that the beginning (as well as most of the movie) was pretty lame. I know this is personal opinion, but a race track in the middle of the day?<br /><br />This brings be to my third gripe. Its obvious a race track was chosen so they could take advantage of the then newer 3d effects. When watching the movie in 2d, it was very evident the parts that were meant for 3d. These parts looked cheesy and out of place in the 2d version.<br /><br />While previous movies relied on creative untimely (albeit) cheesy deaths, this one relied on... well... 3d effects. The deaths were uncreative and liked to exemplify tons of explosions.<br /><br />Unfortunately one weakness in the whole series is plot holes. This time the main character has dreams that give him hints. Also, he has more than one \\"premonition.\\" This really doesnt do something except take up extra time and give the movie the ability to show of the same explosion several times..... Seriously, they had to be running out of ideas.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie seemed to have been made to appeal to the rise of 3d technology in movies. If your watching this for plot, acting, or intelligence, save yourself the time.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|It's not often that I write a review, but this movie was TOO good to not say something.  I just discovered this movie; wow have I been missing out.  This movie had a terrific balance in regards to several social issues. Unions and its affect upon both the workers and owners was handled with great care to both sides of this controversial issue.  Even the issue of the parson's stand against doctrines he felt he could no longer support was handled with great integrity.  These social struggles make John and Margaret the characters they are and they antagonize each other, mostly unintentionally, as she struggles to fit into this new town of manufacturing and the people who live there.  Armitage and Denby-Ashe have a charisma on the screen that has the viewer captivated through all four episodes. The supporting cast also added great depth.  Five stars is not nearly enough; ten or more would be more accurate.  This is a must see, must have movie!
0439023521|4.0|I decided to pick up Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games after seeing multiple stories about the movie casting. I'm glad I did!    The Hunger Games is the tale of Katniss Everdeen, a teen girl who must fight to the death in a brutal, televised match known as The Hunger Games. Though Katniss quickly distinguishes herself as a skilled opponent, her relationship with Peeta, a male competitor from the same district, complicates her experience in the arena. Only one person can survive The Hunger Games. Who will it be? Katniss? Peeta? Or another competitor altogether?     The Hunger Games is a chilling, fascinating story and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. Though the young-adult novel is full of violence and unimaginable suffering, Suzanne Collins also includes messages of love and hope. If you're looking for a unique, fast-paced book than I highly recommend The Hunger Games!
B001AXU1BY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I have seen it over 60 times and know every line.  It's one of the greatest movies and one of my favorites.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|This review is for the new edition of this release. The original album I give 5 stars. But this version was a little disapointing to me. The sound is better, but not that much better. And the second disk is really kind of a waste. It really only has one extra song, which is the full version of one of the short tracks on the original. The other material is live material from much later (huh?)<br />Well its very nice, the the original was fine with me!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Works fine with G2x.   - Did not work with gtablet (CM7)    Hopefully can see the version update on the Amazon Market since the Google Market's version has been updated.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The reviews for this dvd were correct. It is very hard and makes you want to puke.... but it was a great workout
B00005QK5X|5.0|If you like bands like Jay Reatard, Spoon, or Nirvana; just buy this collection. You will love it. One of the most underrated bands of all time.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Acting, that's all I really want to write the writing is also great but the delivery by the actors was amazing.
1594744769|5.0|A wonderful story, told at an exhilarating pace. For his first novel, Riggs weaves a tapestry with the real and the fantastical to create a masterfully told tale about the 'peculiar.' Highly recommended, the book is possible to read in one sitting.

B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game has everything you look for in a classic tower defense game. Other pluses:always runs smooth; nice achievement system; nice resume feature. If you beat the campaign modes you can go back for a higher difficulty level or play a survival mode which is a great change of pace. My favorite game on my phone.

B004UUKDNA|1.0|Only people taking the time to study the lyrics realize \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" is sung from the point of view of a bullied kid contemplating a Columbine-like revenge.    Stories in the news about bullying prompted Foster to pen the character-driven, objective tune, which stands in stark contrast to much of his other material.    \\"I've written so many hopeful songs about love,\\" Foster said.    A German blogger heard \\"Pumped Up Kicks,\\" and made it a viral hit. The song became much talked-about by users of the trend-setting music site The Hype Machine, giving Foster the People little choice but to release it as a debut single.    \\"I was pretty terrified because of the content of the song,\\" Foster said. \\"I didn't want to be blamed for being the catalyst for a kid doing something stupid. My first instinct was fear.

Ion Profile Pro DJ USB turntable is by far the cheapest I have ever used. But wow! In terms of utility and service for the purpose the product is built, I rate it as excellent. I have already transferred some 33 and 45 vinyl records to my Mac Book Pro. Handling the turntable is child's play. You simply take it out from the box and connect the attached USB cable to your computer. Prior to that you have to install the EZ Converter in the computer. I downloaded the software from the internet. Once the USB cable is connected to the computer you are to click the EZ Converter icon and the screen in the computer leads you to finish your recording. The turntable has red and white RCA cable which can be connected to the amplifier for listening through the speakers. Otherwise you can listen directly from the computer speaker or through headphone. The great thing is, unlike most good quality audio turntables, Ion turntable does not require balancing the tone arm or setting the tracking force. You just plug and play and any novice can handle it with ease and record. All in all, Ion USB turntable met more than my expectations. The recorded music sounds excellent and I hardly notice any difference from my more expensive Technics turntable. I gave the turntable five stars considering it's simplicity and recording quality, not to speak of the very low price I paid for. The only thing is, I have not yet figured out how to copy a 78 rpm record. I will appreciate tips from others who have done so.
B00005JY1O|5.0|I usually do not like mono recordings but this one I love. The sound quality is excellent. The songs are masterpieces. No distortion even at a high volume. This record is a joy to listen to. You won't be disappointed.

1936719118|5.0|I bought this book because I was interested in what the author had to say, and also because I was promised some music downloads. The book was awesome - I couldn't put it down. Many kudos to the author for his writing style as well as his splendid values. It is really hard for those of us who are in \\"Customer Service\\" and who work for companies who don't feel the same way about the customers. Many companies feel that it is \\"us\\" against \\"them\\".

B000QCS8TW|5.0|After watching the HBO season 1 of Game of Thrones I decided to see how the book was.  I loved the book, while this doesn't contain a tremendous number of battles the pot line is great.  Definitely worth reading if you enjoyed the HBO series, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book even though I knew the storyline from the HBO series.  I'm not typically into fantasy type books or shows, but this book and series for that matter are great.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is fun and time consuming...but where are the updates. We were promised updates alongside the iPhone, but I've yet to see them.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Ok. I love to read fantasy series. Occasionally the stand alone book works for me but I have been reading Jordan and the like for years and years. Sanderson has created a unique world here. I think his characters are well defined with one of the more truly satisfying endings of any book series I have ever read.     My wife and I liked this so much we named our daughter VIN. For a fun great read look no further.

B0013TTLDE|1.0|When I read a book I don't like, I usually figure it's just not for me, I have different tastes, and move on.  But this book was so bad I had to review it.    My main problem with this book is the character development.  The main character Grace,is a maid on a British estate, and most of the story reads like her laundry list.  You get no sense of who she actually is.  All her emotions are completely dampened - the only way you know she cares about someone or something is because the author explicitly says so.  There's no building up to certain events, just something happens and the character says, \\"I was shocked.\\"  It's kind of like someone saying \\"That's hilarious,\\" instead of actually laughing at a joke.  This applies to all the characters in the story.  Also, the story skips around quite a bit.  At one point, Grace is just a maid, doing her job.  All of a sudden, it's two years later and Hannah, the girl she's serving, says something along the lines of, \\"I can't trust anyone but you.  You're just like a sister to me.\\"  Apparently, in the two years that were skipped, the girls built a relationship and shared more secrets than just the piddly mundane \\"secrets\\" we're offered in the narrative.  It would have been nice to read about their developing friendship, but we just have to take the author's word for it I guess.  Several times.  Relationships are only hinted at or labeled in the story, but never explored in depth.  The culmination of events is pretty anticlimactic.  I figured out the \\"mystery\\" long before the ending, but because you have no real understanding of the relationship between any of the characters, I just felt like, \\"So what?\\"  It just wasn't written as the life-altering experience is should have been.    Thirdly, there are a lot of superfluous characters and sub-plot lines that have absolutely no connection to the story.  Grace's relationship with Alfred for one.  His presence made no difference whatsoever in the story.    All in all, I couldn't geta sense of the characters, felt no connection with them, and felt like I was reading a \\"Day in the Life of a Personality-Challenged Victorian Maid.\\"  If it weren't for a weird compulsion to finish a book once begun, I'd never have read it all the way through.

B003Y5H574|4.0|I tend to underestimate Steve Carell on the big screen probably because of titles like [[ASIN:B004AV5GX6 Dinner for Schmucks]], [[ASIN:B000UNYK4E Evan Almighty]], and of course, [[ASIN:B00005JNZU The 40-Year-Old Virgin]], but when given the opportunity as he did in 2007's [[ASIN:B00118T632 Dan in Real Life]] and as he does in this grown-up 2011 comedy, he can provide unexpected dimension to an otherwise put-upon, sad-sack character. Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has contrivances galore, but it's also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman's screenplay punctuates big life lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and play like a Shakespearean roundelay.<br /><br />The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her newly liberated state, while her and Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile, Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn't succumb to his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.<br /><br />Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman's dialogue into the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end. Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they're here in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but doesn't lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently Hollywood's \\"It\\" girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah, and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei's turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon plays Emily's co-worker with his character's smarminess in check. This is one of the better comedies released this year.of pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.

0312323867|1.0|The main problem with this book is that the lead character, Darcy, was painted in such a negative light in the first book \\"Something Borrowed\\" that the reader finds it very hard to feel any connection, or empathy with her.  In addition, the plot is very weak, with no sense of realism...the whole story is just ridiculous.  I don't know why some people are giving this book 5 stars...all I can think is that they must set their bar very low.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I would rate all 5 seasons 5 stars except for season 3 which was good but not on par with the others. Season 5 starts off well, slows in the middle and finishes with a frantic pace. The acting was tremendous. And based on dexter's last words of the finale... I can't wait for season 6.
B000002AH1|5.0|Live Evil is perhaps one of the funkiest, grooviest, and melodic albums in Miles Davis enormous discography.  This album is especially highly recommended to all fans of On the Corner.    \\"What I Say\\" is where the fast-paced rhythm and the overall funkiness come together to create fascinating results (not to mention a fantastic guitar jam by John McLaughlin near the middle- unquestionably one of McLaughlin's most intense guitar jams while performing with Miles Davis).  At over 20 minutes, it never really loses its firm grip and maintains a satisfying flow.      \\"Funky Tonk\\" is relatively deceiving because at first the saxophone jam does absolutely nothing for me, but repeated listens reveals otherwise.  My favorite moment however, is the 25-plus minute \\"Inamorata & Narratoin By Conrad Roberts\\" because this is when all the melodic aspects of the entire album really come together here and deliver one heck of a performance.  I'm glad it's so melodic because if it wasn't, I'd probably not having the tolerance to sit through the entire thing, haha.    Overall, pick up Live Evil for a splendid and clever taste of jazz/funk.
B004SIP8MK|3.0|Kind of a letdown from the guy who brought us Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds. The violence<br />in this movie is the most graphic in a Tarantino movie yet, and for the most part totally gratuitous --<br />as violent a movie as Pulp Fiction was, you always felt there was some reason or justifcation behind it.<br />Not in this flick. At times, it almost seems a celebration of violence, and in that sense it is quite off-putting.<br /><br />The films has a few bright spots -- there are the usual Tarantino twists and surprises that keep<br />you intrigued; Uma Thurman gives a really strong performance in the lead; but it is Lucy Liu who really<br />impresses, stealing the show as a ruthless assassin who becomes the head of a Yakuza gang in Japan.<br /><br />I would recommend at least a single viewing of this movie to see Thurman and especially Liu's strong performances.<br />But only the most rabid of Tarantino fans will want to watch it more than once.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight never fails to wow me with a story so complex, that after watching it after at least 10 times, I still understand new ideas. Such a complex story keeps me entertained without fail every time I watch it. The reason this is such a good movie, is that Christopher Nolan did not try to make a super hero movie. He created a complex stunning crime action movie with deep, yet classic characters that make it one of, if my most, favorite movie of all time. Couple that with an incredible Blu-ray transfer that delivers stunning sound and picture, and this movie is definitely worth $10.

B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I saw this movie at the Chicago Film Festival last fall, introduced by Alan Cumming. While I'm a huge fan of Helen Mirren (and Alan), I was much less familiar with Julie Taymor, and not sure what I was in for.<br /><br />If you're the same, then you can relax - this is brilliant, and I wish that Mirren & Taymor would do some other Shakespeare plays with Helen in the (strong, male) lead. Aside from a few minutes in the very beginning, where I thought the verisimilitude of the storm interfered with actually being able to understand what the actors were SAYING - there weren't any problems with either the language or being able to follow the plot.<br /><br />Despite changing of the gender of the lead character, all the other elements we expect from Shakespeare remain intact: elevated, aristocratic figures bickering over their positions or inheritance, a love story featuring the younger generation of characters, a comedic subplot running alongside the primary plot, etc. And the acting was great top to bottom - those who weren't aware that RusselL Brand could actually act will be very pleasantly surprised, and we get the amazing performances we expected from the \\"known\\" names. Reeve Carney comes off least well, but that is the fault of the character having so little to do (and most of THAT being to look attractive and moon over the young woman).<br /><br />All in all, I was very happy I was able to catch this in the cinema, and can hardly wait until I'm able to own a copy.
B005DJGMQE|3.0|I knew the story and it was apparent very early that the trial was going to be a sham.  A revenge trial at best.  I have seen Robin Wright play much better parts.  This movie just sort of ho hummed along until the no surprize end finally arrived.  Wait for Netflix or cable.  Don't buy it.

I inserted the DVD and guess what-every damm song on that DVD was scratched. It wasn't the DVD player, other discs played fine.  Both the Joni Mitchell CD and this DVD I ordered were scratched which begs the question- where is Amazon's quality control?
0470450266|5.0|This book has an incredulous amount of information on the human anatomy and useful sculpting techniques. 400 pages written with great specificity and the DVD lets you watch Scott do the whole sculpt, allowing newer sculptors hours of video to watch Scott's workflow and fully understand what he's doing since he narrates every step. The DVD comes with countless invaluable ztools such as the skinned figure and the planed figure. Simply switch to these ztools for reference when you run into any discrepancy problems. In addition to the anatomy sculpt he also teaches professional texturing techniques for skin and creating clothing pieces for a character. To pass this book up would be doing yourself a disfavor.

Highly recommended.
B0034G4P8K|3.0|Loved the TF G1 Series as a Kid and guess what I still watch them to this Today Seasons 1-4. Then came Summer of 2007 and TF's The Movie hit the big screen and Took what I loved and brought it to Life! the AutoBots/Decepticons were everything and More Then Meets The Eye! then 2009 Saw TF's:Revenge Of The Fallen and I loved it because it was a Straight Up Action Adventure Movie with a Decent Plot and lots of Special Effects to Make number one seem Small Scale but My Major Gripe is Sam was still acting like a Bitch through out the Movie and cost The Autobots their Greatest Hero until of course the Fabled Matrix Of Leadership Sub plot was used which made Optimus Prime into the Bad Ass Doom Bringer to Megatron and his Precious Savior The Fallen. well 2011 came and we get TF:Dark Of The Moon it was 50/50 great Special Effects and a not bad Story(much less interesting then 1&2) Sadly but 1 thing the Great Michael Bay Fudged up on is ! Sams still a Wimpy,Whiny sack of Crap through The Film! Um you would think He'd Be more of a Strong and Confident Man who sees the Value of helping Ensure The that Evil Decepticons never Win because it would be the Death or Enslavement of The Human Race and Considering what happened to Optimus in TF2 because Sam Acted like a Scared little Bitch and Optimus paid for that with his Spark. Luckily The Matrix Of LeaderShip saved Him and Thankfully Ensure he didn't Die again (permanently). I am Hopeful that with Shia not being in the Next TF's Trilogy they find a more Powerful and Mature Actor to Carry on the Franchise!!! (Jason Statham was mentioned as very Possible Replacement so lets All Hope it proves True?) I'd Love to See a Real Bad Ass in the TF's series like Mr.Statham kicking ass blowing up Decepticons and Ensuring Freedom Is The Right Of All Sentient Beings!!!
0316056863|3.0|The book was disappointing.   It felt like the writing was slightly too young for me.     I wanted to laugh, and I love women's comedy writing, but I wasn't.   The stories weren't the gems I was hoping for, or really very funny.     I also felt like I already knew different stages of an actor's life, and wasn't impressed with the recall.     I really enjoy Tina Fey on 30 Rock and SNL and have even called her my favorite comedian, but this book left something to be desired.

B002IFT1ZA|1.0|Why was my review deleted?!  It didn't have any strong words, it was just a regular review and it was on this side for months before someone deleted it.   That's horrible! If my opinion is unpopular, don't I deserve to be heard? Did HBO forbid negative reviews on this title? Why can't I say my opinion on this series? Be it a good or a bad opinion, I deserve the freedom to say what I think, don't I?  So, I'll say it again - this is a terrible series that really fits everything else on HBO.   It takes one amazing book and turns it into something soulless. It is a horrible adaptation - this HBO production takes the novel too literally, so the characters and the storylines just lose their depth. Everything feels empty and shallow.   And one other thing - most of the characters lose their bite, so they could be more likable. Tyrion is far less cynical and his back-story is toned down a bit, so he could seem more like the good guy. Cersei is too vulnerable, too understandable when it comes to Robert's pain, which is nothing like the fierce woman we know. Sansa is not that kind and noble lady, she is rude and arrogant. Jon Snow is too fluffy and doe-eyed, the anger and resentment in this boy are totally cut out. And Catelyn has been changed too, so she could fill the stereotype of \\"STRONG female character\\". In the books she is really nostalgic and what she really wants is peace, she begs her people to ask for peace and is sad that her men are lead my pride and desire for revenge. Here she says thing like \\"We will kill them all!\\". Why? Just because it sounds like a better catch-phrase.    So don't waste your time or your money on this one.
1612130283|4.0|What an interesting book. It had a lot going for it, but it had a lot against it as well, and that's making it hard to rate. This is a big departure for me. I don't read erotica very often and it's rare for me to read anything with BDSM in it. But when a Goodreads friend of mine recommended the book I had to at least see if it interested me. I went to Google Books and started reading the sample, but the first chapter didn't impress me at all. I left her a message saying the equivalent of \\"thanks but no thanks\\" but then kept reading in idle curiosity. By the third chapter I was intrigued enough to change my mind and get a copy. Fickle, thy name is Catherine. ;)    What turned me off so much about the first chapter was the writing style. It was rough, very rough. The book is in first person present tense (I loathe that style) and it read like fanfiction. It had the unpolished feel that I associate with many of them, and it had a bit of a `this, then this, then this, then this' feel to it. Not really my style. But, the setup interested me. The heroine was very blushing and innocent and easily overwhelmed by the hero, but I can adapt. Not all of my heroines need to be strong and badass in the beginning. In addition to a rough writing style, there were also quite a few typos. I'm not the biggest stickler, but I have to admit that it was irritating and that I expect better from published authors.    While the writing was the biggest downfall of the book, the plot and the character development were its saving grace. I am...conflicted about what I thought of Ana. On one hand she felt bland and underdeveloped, almost like a placeholder heroine. She was very innocent, which I didn't necessarily mind, but she also felt childish, which I did mind. She was very contained on the outside--sometimes I would forget about this until another character brought it up--but was a mass of insecurity and uncertainty on the inside, which made it occasionally painful to watch her timidity around Christian and any kind of conflict. On the other hand, she really impressed me with her approach to the possibility of a relationship with Christian. She was intrigued by him but repelled by what he wanted from her. I couldn't help but enjoy her as a heroine, despite the problems I had with her, because she pretty much reflected my whole issue with BDSM in general. I enjoyed watching her try to reconcile her dislike of his desires with her honest desire to be with him. She also became much, much stronger as the book continued on and impressed me by really following what she needs. I'm very curious to see how this develops.    The shining star of this book was really the hero, Christian. He was a fascinating character. Reading about him felt reminiscent of reading a Robin Schone book. I was drawn to him for the same reason I was drawn to Schone's heroes Michael and Gabriel--complexity. Here was a man who didn't have a problem interacting with people and charming them, but he didn't actually desire any close ties. He was afraid of intimacy--although I'm sure that's not how he saw it--and was repulsed by the thought of being touched and cuddled. Everything had to be on his terms and he was confounded by his overwhelming attraction to a woman who was not part of his scene, who did not like being submissive, and who hated the thought of being punished for someone else's pleasure. His moods were mercurial and he could occasionally veer toward stalkerish and obsessive, but underneath it all he was devastatingly vulnerable and tortured. Both he and Ana had to take a hard look at themselves and really figure out how much they wanted to be together. They both had to make steps to compromise and try to find a middle ground.    So, this leaves me with the conflict. How do I rate something that absolutely fascinated me, despite leaving me occasionally uncomfortable with the subject matter, yet which had such an irritating writing style? I wavered between 3.5 and 4 stars andam still somewhat hesitant on the grade that I have chosen. I think I'll have to go with a 4, though, because I'd be lying if I said I didn't pound it and immediately fiend for the next one when I got to the end. I hated the style, yes, but I've found better written books that didn't interest me half as much, so I think I'll just have to go with my enjoyment level on this one.
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm ([...])<br /><br />Oh. My. God. Seriously? I. Freaking. Loved. This. Book. Why did it have to end?! Why?! It was amazing. I have heard soooo many great things about this book. I kept hearing that it was one of their most favorite contemporary novels for the year, and for some the greatest ever!<br /><br />It definitely got me intrigued and when I was able to snag it at the library without putting a hold on it, I was ecstatic! I wasn't even looking for it at the time, I mean, I knew I wanted to read it, but I was just browsing the shelves and I saw the Eiffel tower on the spine and then the name and I freaked and grabbed it.<br /><br />I don't even know how to explain this book. I started reading it and that was it. I was hooked. From the first freaking page! And I didn't stop then, nope. I read until, like, 4 in the morning! I only got in about 200 pages before falling asleep, but I finished the next day. And wow, I even dreamed about Paris and, of course, St. Clair (Drools!) when I was sleeping. And that's after about half an hour of tossing and turning while thinking about the book. I couldn't get it out of my head. And I still can't. I am so unbelievably sad I finished it. I keep staring at the pretty cover and making a sad face. Normally books this size (Nearly 400.) takes me a few days to read nowadays because I have my son, but I read this book pretty dang fast! If I could add up all my time spent reading it, it might have been about 5 hours all together? And that's because half the time I would read very slow in some areas, or go back and read it over again to smile at it. I will definitely be rereading this in the future and I can NOT wait to read the companion novel Lola and the Boy Next Door. I don't even know what it's about yet because I told myself I would read Anna and the French Kiss before reading the synopsis for the companion.<br /><br />Anna was a great protagonist, she annoyed me at some points, but all the characters were great. Especially St. Clair! God he's hot. And soooo nice! Even the annoying preppy girls like Amanda was fun to read about. All the characters were pretty real to me, they made mistakes and learned from them, and they were flawed.<br /><br />The writing pulls you in and has great detail. And I mean GREAT detail. Perkins did an amazing job describing the streets of Paris. I've always wanted to go there, but after reading this I want to go NOW.<br /><br />But overall, just get it. It was amazing. Really.

0316098329|3.0|Room is a beautifully conceived and constructed novel that suffers from a nearly fatal flaw:  it is written in the first person in the present tense.  Much, in commentary, has been made of Jack's voice, its authenticity and reach.  But by definition the present tense in the first person may be used only for work that the reader reads as it is 1. being written or 2. being spoken (i.e., dictated and transcribed).  It's difficult to believe and accept that a boy just turned five would be able to write (spell) and/or dictate such words (taken at random from the text) as \\"trafficking,\\" \\"ceramic,\\" \\"multicolored,\\" \\"Navaho,\\" \\"Velcro\\" (with its trademark cap--how would he know?), \\"depersonalization and jamais vu,\\" \\"omnivores\\" (which, when he speaks it, his aunt comments, \\"My, you know big words,\\" which is probably the author commenting as well, as a signal to readers please to accept Jack's precocity).     This novel would be even more effective were it to dispense with the phony immediacy of the present tense and be told in the classic simple past tense.  I read some pages as if they had been so written; they lost nothing and gained much.  Future printings/editions would benefit from such a revision.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I loved Teenage Dream so much that I got One Of The Boys too. And guess what? I like this one even better!    Perry's got the makings of a great image artist. The retrolicious cover shot is so Varga Girl Pin-Up set in 1950s McCarthy. Picket fences included.    Well, the music is very pop rock on a bright sunny day. Heterosexual males will of course appreciate the girl-on-girl ditty I Kissed A Girl. Well, other musical gems such as Thinking Of You and Waking Up In Vegas are great singalongs.     My all time fave is Hot N Cold. Having not heard of Perry in 2008, I thought Pink sang this one. Just love to chorus Hot N Cold in the car. The video's a hoot. Check out the drag queen bridesmaid and the way all the wedding guests sing on cue like a Hollywood movie.     This rather brisk set ends after 45 minutes. Nonetheless, it's a great way to start the day.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are great decals for any little princess!     I decided to buy these princesses and the big castle for my 2 year olds room, Her room is really pink. The walls are all painted with very bright pink so I was actually looking for decals that could be seen and not just looked ghostly.     The PROs -     Decals are easy to take off - I had to take them off a couple of times till I got the design how I wanted it.   Comes with plenty of other decals - Flowers, The fairy godmothers, birds, etc. Great accents!   Can definitely be seen through hot pink!   They blend into the wall, I don't even think my daughter knows there stickers.     The CONs -     Only could find 2 cons...    Some of the stickers weren't cut all the way so I had to take a razorblade to a couple of them to get it off the paper. Not that big of a deal and could have just been my batch.   The gems also seem to not stick to painted walls very well, It might just be the Valspar paint I used but some gems (Well away from where my 2 year old can reach) have fallen off. My solution is Crazy glue. So again not that big of a deal.    All in all I would recommend these and the castle to ANY parent with a little princess! They complete the room so well, I wish I could post a picture of the wall where the castle and princesses are.
B000002NAK|5.0|Evita was the first political musical that I've seen. I went because of two reasons. Firstly, I wanted to see if Madonna could pull this off. Also, I was kind of curious to see why there's a big outcry as some people wanted the film banned.    After watching Evita and listening to the CD, I was rather shocked. Here they are, depicting Eva Peron as a woman who traded sexual favors to get to the top (Goodnight And Thank You). Alone in a big city with no family and friends, I mean what's a girl to do in a world controlled by men? Another assertion in Waltz For Eva And Che was that her rivals were \\"cut up or simply disappear\\" referring to Eva's abuse of power as First Lady.    My jaw dropped further when Eva threw herself at the presidential hopeful Juan Peron (I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You) and her demands for designer clothes \\"so Christian Dior me\\" (Rainbow High). At times, I felt sorry for her when she was snubbed by the wealthy elite in The Actress Hasn't Learned The Lines (You'd Like To Hear).    I remember that the CD was really compelling and engrossing. And the singing was top notch. Did Madonna pull it off? She did, with plenty of aplomb. High Flying, Adored, Don't Cry For Me Argentina and Another Suitcase In Another Hall are songs that you do not expect the Erotica singer to do so well. I'm completely surprised. The piece de resistance is the tailor made for Madonna tearjerker, You Must Love Me which she sings with much heartbreaking conviction.
B002VECMAO|4.0|I didn't know anything about this movie going into it. I hadn't seen any preview or read anything about...the cast just really appealed to me. Not having any expectations is probably the best way to view it. As Amazon's synopsis will tell you, the movie centers around Ewan McGregor's schlub of a journalist stumbling onto a group of psi-ops \\"Jedi\\" who once worked for the government. The comedy ensues from his attempt to figure out whether these people truly believe what they're saying, or if he's been excluded from some really sick joke. Jeff Bridges is at his hippie best here, and Clooney gives a tongue in cheek performance as the one \\"mind Jedi\\" who really seems to take his beliefs off the deep end. McGregor is unfortunately relegated to being background filler, his comedic talents not being utilized by half. Don't kill yourself trying to wrap your mind around this movie the first time you see it...it's not nearly as meaningful as it tries to be.

B002T9H2L0|4.0|I don't think I've seen a Tarantino film I liked more than Inglorious Basterds. It has a little bit of everything a guy's movie should have...wanton and gratuitous violence, language that would make sailors blush and of course beautiful (and dangerous) women. I really liked seeing Brad Pitt take on a different role than what I've come to expect from him and just run with it. Michael Fassbender is at his swaggering stiff-upper-lip best as well. If the kids are already put to sleep, check this one out.

B0009S4IKQ|5.0|Hollywood's first all star cast for a film was a blockbuster. With names such as Barrymore,Beery,Garbo,Crawford,Stone,Hersholt,how can you go wrong. The film depicts that people in upper class society can have tragedy that their fortune can't protect them. The film release was perfect timing since the Great Depression was in full swing. Yet, the stars still seem to entertain the public with grand style. A GRAND HOTEL PERFORMANCE BY ONE AND ALL !!!
B000PHVZNE|5.0|Due to the fact that it's just a movie, it does not warrant a review other than it works fine.
0767827791|2.0|Just saw this movie for the first time ever, very strange, just never been very interestd in it, but glad I saw it for the beauty that was Kim Novak (the only cast member who is still alive)> But the film is so so dated, Rosalind Russell's performance is so over wrought, stagey, ridiculous. She seemed to improve as a film actor in the last 15 years of her career, she was not at her best here. Using film acting technique more acceptable in the thirties. William Holden is so so miscast, twenty years too old for the role. A wonderful actor nonetheless, but it spoils the whole film that he is so old for the role that should be played by someone about 25 to 30. Incidentally, the print I have is in widescreen , bought in Australia, but seems to be the international print. I am guessing the version now available worldwide would be widescreen which is used so well.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Any Clint Eastwood film is going to be masterfully crafted.So, the content is what one may like or dislike, but rarely is the film a bad product. And this film has a great story, and a superb craftsmanship. With, to my surprise, the main music being done by Clint, and in the extras, you can see some of the theme music being played by clint.        Given its unique material, the first film I thought was similar to it was AFTERLIFE; with the caveat that AFTERLIFE is a first film, and so is not as refined as the material, and the execution of this film. HEREAFTER delivers a quality supernatural undertone without this wonderfully chilling element subsuming the character driven content of Clint's film. The way the story weaves together three people's lives and eventually brings the two leads together, is both brilliant on the film level, and emotionally fulfilling on the personal level. The dramatic tones are a superb experience on the heavier side ( the supernatural elements) as well as the themes of loss relating to the young British actor, and the French actress who visits a character who is remarkably like Dr Elizabeth Kubler-Ross ( in some respects, not all). For AFTERLIFE, and HEREAFTER, my comment for the AFTERLIFE review was that the coment \\"get a life\\" applies; well, Afterlife achieves this in a heavy handed way, and HEREAFTER achieves this in a dramatically fulfilling way, with a style few people can manage. Also, the extras on the DVD are great, they shows elements that I would suggest you don't watch until after seeing the film, since the they show how the strong and very realistic images are achieved.     Clint Eastwood has done another great piece, very strong on many levels, and whilst it achieves the surreal elements I prefer, it also gives the heart ache of the personal experience in its sadest times.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Usually I like romantic comedies!  This is a movie where the world would be better off if all the main characters just died.  A group of horrible people who cheat and lie to each other.  Congrats to \\"good girl\\" Rachel for ending up with the guy of her dreams: her best friend's fiance.  I mean, I guess I knew the plot to some extent when I rented it, but it was far more off-putting than I imagined it would be.  The only likable, decent character is the one who loses out.  And the selfish, cheating liars end up together (which I suppose is fitting).  I'd say don't waste your time with this one!

The late James Halliday constructed the electronic puzzler filed with riddle and games that has been home to billions of \\"gunters\\" competing for years to find the three magical keys to open the gates and therefore win the ultimate prize: ownership of the extremely successful and affluent OASIS Company.<br /><br />Inside OASIS Wade's character is impoverished Parzival.  When Parzival finds the copper key and opens the first gate, other gunters chase after him.  Worse are the \\"\\"Sixers\\"\\" working for IOI corporation led by Sorrento; their job is to prevent anyone from succeeding.  Their agents are searching for the egg are called Sixers.  As Sorrento plans to charge a fee for participating in the game, his agents hunt Parzival and his allies on line and Wade in reality.<br /><br />Nostalgia 1980s fans will enjoy this futuristic Tron, as many of the games and other pop icons from that era appear inside of OASIS.  The story line is at its best when Parzival works the clues while others stalk him; it slows down somewhat with overkill description of the games employed inside of OASIS.  Still fans will enjoy this entertaining tale as virtual reality is the only thing keeping social reality from total splintering.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B004VFYPTW|5.0|I've been familiar with this show for at least 10 years. I own a japanese bootleg with the BBC broadcast in excellent quality. However, as a great Coverdale fan and always in love with Slip of the Tongue album, I decided to go with this official release. And I'm not desappointed. Although David's voice is not 100% and Vanderberg guitars sometimes low in the mix, this show is absolutely great. Steve Vai added so much power to the band that it's impossible not to enjoy his riffs and additional notes. The atmosphere is awesome and the set list wonderful. You can't go wrong with this.

Well... for a while. Until I reflected. And probed deeper. Dammit, the man (and his co-author, Jerry Porras) were right: Those big, lumbering but sustainable Fortune 500 behemoths are actually lead by sound engineering or number crunching guys (Sorry Larry Ellison, Harvey Mackay and Steve Jobs, you better go find new positions).<br /><br />At last, that was what I was reading by the snippet I encountered in Inc, and Jim's email response to my query.<br /><br />In reality, Collins goes on to say that systems, process and elements of corporate integrity can create a support system for leadership that is less Hewlett or Grove, and more Steve Jobs.

B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra has recorded a collection of 51 songs from the Bergmans throughout her illustrious career. She adds this intimate collection of lush, romantic, heartfelt and jazzy interpretation of 10 songs to her impressive repertoire of songs. While Barbra's voice has matured (her belting voice is now more raspy, vibrato has turned tremolo), she carries every single one of these tunes from this album in a manner that truly touches the meaning of the songs - still with lots of masterful control, unusual from singers her age. Barbra continues to be gifted in delivering ballads and in some instances, rewriting the original lyrics to make these songs inherently hers. Clearly, she has left her indelible mark on \\"Windmills of Your Mind,\\" \\"What Matters Most,\\" and \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\" among others. The meaning and the emotions of these songs come through with her distinctive phrasing. Her gift as an actress shows in her astute renditions - her genius and musical discernment of the stories associated with these songs. \\"That face\\" is also another standout \\"playful\\" track from the album which is reminiscent of boldness and cheekiness of \\"I'm Still Here.\\" While others appreciate the quiet and mellowness of her previous studio album, \\"Love is the Answer\\", the selections of this particular album are more modern and inherently in keeping Barbra's preference and style of delivery - rightly so because she produced it. The orchestrations that wrap around Barbra's vocals are lush and sweeping. Because of her affinity to interpret the lyrics of the Bergmans and the history of their professional and personal friendships, the source material fits Barbra to a glove. With this album, Barbra is likely to add her sixth number one album across each of the six decades, making her the only female singer to do so in the history of Billboard. Rightly and deservingly so !
B000058983|5.0|This beautiful, seminal piece of work from 1967 is one of the very best examples of 1960s artistry: quintessential psychedelia with a hard edge, wry and humorous with a hint of cynicism, musically fabulous and totally original. From a quiet start in 1967 the reputation of `Forever Changes' has grown with the years by word-of-mouth to now be included in just about everyone's top 10 best albums of all time. The clever mix of instrumentation includes acoustic guitars juxtaposed with sensitively deployed brass and a small string orchestra; high tenor-register vocal leads from Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean articulating the most haunting and ambitious lyrical writing with clean, hard electric guitar occasionally cutting through, offering a unique listening experience never forgotten.<br /><br />So much deserving praise has been heaped on `Forever Changes' that it's difficult to offer any valuable new perspective. It's a definitive classic, as fresh and listenable in 2011 as it was in 1967. The songs are clever, memorable and repeat-listenable and the song titles - `Alone Again or...', `Maybe the People would be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale', `Andmoreagain' and `The Good Humor Man he sees everything like this' - are eccentric and delightful. Whilst representative of the 1960s `West Coast Sound' (i.e. The Byrds, Jefferson Airplane etc.) FC is at the same time unlike anything else before or since. It's touched with genius.<br /><br />Arthur Lee returned to performing this material on a revival tour in 2002, to great acclaim throughout America, Europe and Australia - prior to his death in 2006 from acute myeloid leukaemia at age 61 following years of aggressive medical treatment which in the end only postponed the inevitable. A DVD of one of the star performances from this tour, with Lee in his late 50s fronting a new, younger band channelling the original `Forever Changes', is also worth checking out and much better than you might expect 35 years on from the original (cue Van Morrison's recent revival of the equally mould-breaking and contemporaneous `Astral Weeks').<br /><br />If you're of a younger generation and are interested in exploring the music of the 1960s, `Forever Changes' should definitely be on your top 10 shopping list and needs to be present in any moderately serious music collection. Just listen to it once, and you'll instantly understand what all the fuss is about. No-one in recent years has recorded anything so imaginative, daring or enduringly beautiful as FC and it's doubtful that the commercially-driven and play-it-safe-formula-worshipping music industry of the 21st century would ever allow space for such mould-breaking originality and excellence to shine.orrison's recent revival of the equally mould-breaking and contemporaneous `Astral Weeks').

We also get to see one of my favorite characters from the entire show, Zod. Callum Blue did an excellent job in this episode, as I would have suspected from his role in season 9.
0446691437|5.0|I love this book. It was introduced to me during an acting class, and the writer spoke at the school sometime later. This book describes the inner resistance one would have doing anything.  It's not just art. I think it's best described as the difference from being an amateur and a professional. He explains the difference in the book and it's poignant.  What keeps us from fulfilling our drive is resistance.  I enjoyed the book. The writer has a snappy style and the words just flow like a stream. I recommend the book.

B004A8ZX28|4.0|This was a good movie.  We both love Liam's acting.  The plot had us guessing til the end.  My wife usually guesses things in movies and she guessed wrong on what was going on and I had no clue either.  It was a great twist.  The only complaint we had was that the movie dragged in a few places.  The stunt driving was great!  The actors all did an excellent job!  The music in the movie was very very well done!   My wife really liked the music in the club scene by New Order.  If you are fan of Taken, you will like this , but just remember it takes a while for Liam to get riled up and turn into a butt kicker~!   lol
0440214041|1.0|A super-rich oil guy is behind killing 2 Supreme Court Justices because the Court will eventually, in about 4 or 5 years, decide if this guy can drill for oil in an environmentally protected area.    A law student investigates the crime and finds out that the only thing the 2 dead Justices had in common was that they were pro-environment. She also finds out that the super-rich oil guy is a big supporter of the President, who is obviously oil-friendly and will now have to appoint 2 new Supreme Court Justices.     The law student writes a paper with her theory that the super-rich oil guy is responsible for the murders and it quickly gets into the hands of the FBI and the President, who tells the FBI Director to back off from the investigation for a few weeks.    A few people get killed and it ends with the super rich oil guy being indicted because a newspaper reporter who deals with the Supreme Court helps the law student expose her information in a news article. The President announces he will not seek reelection.    The premise for this book is that the greatest investigative minds in the FBI did not have a clue concerning the murders, but a law student easily figured it out, which meant the super rich oil guy had to get rid of her.    If 2 Supreme Court Justices are killed and the only thing they have in common is being pro-environment, all one has to do is find out who would make tons of money from a Supreme Court ruling against people who were pro-environment and who has the wealth to finance killing 2 Supreme Court Justices.    Any FBI investigator and almost any detective on any police force could have easily solved this crime. Any investigative reporter could have easily determined the facts and put out a news story stating such, but according to this book, only this clever law student has the potential to expose the diabolical scheme with her simple theory, which is why she has to die.     Stupid, dumb, and slow-moving. Do not waste your time.

B0058A119G|5.0|Shes back and sounds better than ever!! For those who keep saying they enjoyed her earlier style, um get with the times, shes 69 and do you really expect her to still sound that way and do the same thing??<br />This is her best album in almost ten years and blows Love Is the Answer out of the water. This work really reminds me of A Love Like Ours, but a little more upbeat in a way. This is very jazzy, calming, lush, evoking, sexy. Her voice is in amazing condition and you would never know her age by listening. Sure some notes are bit deeper than they once were, but she still has it and there are high octaves here that soar that were missing from 2009's Love is the Answer. This is sweeping, cinema epic, and you can tell the care and research that went into getting this just right. This album also reminds me a little bit of Christmas Memories in its vocal style. Yes you dont go driving down the road cranking up the base expecting a dance beat album for goodness sakes, this is pure classic Streisand that makes you feel and reflect and wonder. I think I read another review on here that said this album reminds the person again why they are a fan, and that is the best way to sum it up. Congratulations Barbra, you have brought it home and then some! Oh and Windmills On My Mind, was never a fan of that song, but wow she owns it now. It just takes you away. More than ten songs would have been nice, but I see why she did it this way. It keeps it cozy and compact, plus the bonus disc of her older songs is a great combo package with the new.
0765350386|3.0|I picked up Mistborn as a continuation of my usual spending time in the beginning of the alphabet.  I had also seen Brandon Sanderson as a co-author with a fair number of the greats previously.  The book isn't perfect.  You can see where Vin and Kelsier are going from very early on, women are chattel (hello fantasy genre!) or superpowered tomboys, or more cunning than men (because you have to be better to succeed of course).  Despite these faults, the story is good and leaves me wanting to read more.  Which is the main important thing for a book.
0553801473|2.0|After reading 200 pages I was wondering where the story is going to take me. After 400 pages I thought I knew and started to raise my expectations. Then after plodding through another 300 pages I early wanted the book to come to an end. When it did come to an end on the last 10 pages I was left with a feeling that nothing had really happened and that I had read a book of short stories without endings. Was this just an interim book to cover up for a contract that GRRM had to fulfill? It certainly wasn't his best, in fact it was far from it. I read it because it was written by a great author. If there had been another name on the cover, then I would have closed the book half way through. If anything it was a waste of time!
0553801473|5.0|This book was great, it really does leave you hanging though and I know the author was saying that it will be a year or so before he even has time to write the next book. That sucks, but overall this book and the four before it were really great. I love this series, the characters are with me where-ever I go, I can't stop thinking about them...how many other books do that!?<br /><br />I was upset by some of the things that happened in this book but he's been doing that to us since Eddard Stark died, so it's a little less painful after that...and what the fuzz is Arya doing?!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this series to anyone and everyone, in fact, despite looking like a mega-nerd I promote the series to everyone I know. If you get the chance, read this series, I highly doubt you will regret it.

0545123275|5.0|See more reviews on my blog: [...]<br /><br />I heart Maggie Steivfater.  She is incredibly creative, artistic, and musical.  On top of that she writes beautiful fiction and Shiver is the perfect example of this.  Sweet and moving, Shiver is a unique and magical love story that captures you from the beginning.<br /><br />Shiver opens with Grace, as a little girl, being dragged from her back yard and mauled by the wolves that live in the forest behind her house.  One yellowed eyed wolf protects her from the hungry pack and saves her life.  Despite the attack, Grace feels a connection to the wolves, particularly the yellow eyed wolf that watches from the woods but the wolves of Mercy Falls are no ordinary wolves.<br /><br />In the cold, Sam becomes a wolf and in the heat, he is a boy.  Split between two lives, human and wolf, Sam's life is complicated. For years, he's longed to talk to Grace and for her to know his secret.<br /><br />When Sam and Grace finally meet, there is instant chemistry between them.  Linked to each other for years, the two are captivated by each other and their love story warms your heart.  Sam is empowered by his love for Grace, yet is disheartened to have met her so close to his final years.  Torn by the thought of not being together, they search for a cure for Sam.<br /><br />Eloquently told from the perspectives of the two main characters, Steivfater interweaves the many intricacies of Sam and Grace's story.  Through Grace, the reader experiences the mystery of the wolves and the real world events of Mercy Falls. Sam's point of view brings to life the mythology of the werewolves, their challenges, and the remarkable woods in which they live.<br /><br />Amidst an abundance of werewolf novels, Steivfater's wolves are unique and imaginative while at the same time very believable. Her poetic prose and stunning love story make Shiver a must read.  Linger and Forever are the next books in this enchanting series.
B003VANOFY|2.0|This is a GREAT headset - when it works.  Very clear sound and great microphone.  But mine keeps shutting itself off.  I teach online classes.  It is highly frustrating to have to stop class and turn the headset back on every 30 minutes or so.  I followed all the instructions.  I just not sure if this is a problem just with my headset or not.  Be warned ... it you are in the middle of a game or program it might be a real ouch.  It certainly is painful for my students to not be able to listen to the class lecture.
0307456625|2.0|This book was okay, not one of my favorites.  Probably won't buy anymore.  Only read it because it was my Book Club pick, but wouldn't buy another one.
B001BPQT8A|3.0|Some marketplace sellers seem to be selling the Canadian version of this blu-ray book.  I bought mine from iNetVideo, and was disappointed with the product.  And while the Blu-Ray disc is still Region A and plays perfectly, please be advised that the Canadian digibook packaging is inferior to the US digibook.<br /><br />- The US version has a very nice back cover (all the disc specifics are on a removable back cover sheet).  The Canadian version has all the info printed directly on the back cover.<br />- The Canadian set includes some French text on the spine/back cover.<br />- The Canadian book has a different spine design than the US book, it looks weird sitting next to the other digibooks on my shelf (which all have uniform spine layout).<br /><br />This does not affect the quality of the movie, which I completely recommend.  But if you are a collector, I recommend that you contact the seller first to be sure that you are getting the official US product from Warner Bros. before you buy.

B000AQJPQE|1.0|My wife had looked all over for this light for my 7 year old because we were doing a space theme for his bedroom.  THis light was a major disappointment and wasn't worth the time we spent looking for it and definitely not worth the cost.  It's a battery operated system and is virtually useless as a light source.  A single candle would put out more light than this unit.  The construction is cheap and is much smaller than it appears in the ad.  There are some wires holding some pieces of plastic and it spins around.  We would have returned it but we already wasted too much time with this light!!!
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I've been a fan of the \\"Space Battleship Yamato\\" animated series known as \\"Star Blazers\\" in the United States back in 1978.  I've wanted to see a live action version of it and in 2010 they finally made one.  The quality and technology of special effects necessary to pull it off has been achieved and it shows on the screen.  This movie was shot at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and they fill it with action from end to end.    The story is based on the original one seen in the TV series of Earth vs the Gamilons.  The original characters are there more or less.  With that in mind, this is not your father's or grandfather's \\"Space Battleship Yamato.\\"  Some of the differences are interesting, some are shocking.  The way it's crafted, this movie can be enjoyed by those who don't know anything about the TV series as well as long time fans.    This copy produced by Sarawak Media Corporation of Malaysia is near perfect.  The movie is presented in its full 2.35:1 aspect ratio with its original Japanese dialogue and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. It has English subtitles and they are almost complete.  There are 2 or 3 scenes that are missing the caption but it's minor.    This version is far superior to another on being produced on DVD by another company.    My thanks to Sarawak Media Corporation for producing this DVD and LOTO-SURPLUS for selling it at an affordable price.
B005HSL626|3.0|ive played fruit ninja before and love it. this one opens up to an ad for another app and force closes every time. :(
B005CMGKTG|3.0|I've been a fan of the \\"Space Battleship Yamato\\" TV series called \\"Star Blazers\\" here in the United States back in 1978.  I've always said that it should be made into a live action movie and in 2010 they finally did it.  When I saw the theatrical trailer online, I said I've got ot see it.  I was hoping that it would be released to theaters here in the United States but that never happened.  That left seeing it on DVD as my last option.  When it finally came out in June of this year, the manufacturer produced DVDs without English subtitles.  That left me out in the cold.    Then I saw this copy called \\"Space Battleship Yamato - The final battle.\\"  I was suspicious but I ordered it anyway because it said it had English subtitles.    When I received it and played it, my suspicions were confirmed.  This copy is a bootleg version.  Here's what's wrong with it.  The movie was shot at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio but on this DVD it's streached to a 1.85:1 ratio.  The movie was recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 but this disc only has Dolby Surround.  Some of the subtitles are either wrong or came across as silly.    On the other hand, it was the best I could get at the time.    However, another company is making copies of this movie on DVD that are superior.  The movie is presented in its full 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound along with the Japanese dialogue and the English subtitles are more accurate.    I bought the new copy and am very happy.  That makes this first copy obsolete and unnecessary.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Even though I already owned this on both DVD and Blu-Ray, with the extras included in this I bought it without a second thought. It's definitely worth it for any collector and makes a great addition to my own FFVII Collection. The postcards that come in this set are gorgeous and great for display, but without a doubt the best part of this is the book it comes with. It's got three stories inside, part of the \\"On The Way to a Smile\\" set of stories, which take place before - and leading up to - the movie. These are great windows into the characters, and they let you see more into their minds as you read their feelings on the rebuilding of the world after Meteor.    ANY true fan of Final Fantasy VII needs to get this.
B000C13Y2S|5.0|Great product to use when needing to shine kight on a particular area without the use of your hands. Also, the ability to split the unit into three different flaslights is very useful. The batteries also last a long time.

A great companion album to get with this (I did) is \\"The Very Best Of Chicago - Only The Beginning.\\" I would also like to add that the recording quality is excellent considering it's age. Thanks.
B0059R5Q08|1.0|Don't waste your money. This is by far the worst Jane Eyre I've ever seen. I didn't even finish it. The main actress plays Jane Eyre as if she is half asleep. There is no passion or spark to her performance. It's as if she has no interest in the role that she is playing. If she has no interest, why should we? (Note the young actresses playing Jane Eyre were great, but they're on the screen briefly.)

0345529057|5.0|I've been banging through my summer reading list pretty fast. Really just started reading the series. Was watching the HBO show and was intrigued. A friend at work recommended I read the books. So glad I am they are terrific!
B001R6G34I|5.0|Captivating from start to finish. Lots of fun, action, adventure, suspense.  Great characters.  A unique thing about this movie is that there are really no \\"bad guys\\", and yet there is plenty of death and danger.  Fay Wray is so easy to love.  Robert Armstrong has so much energy to spare.  This movie was recently selected as one of the top 50 American movies.  Trivia:  they left out a scene where some of the ships crew were eaten alive by giant spiders because the test audience hated that scene.  In the newest King Kong movie there was a similar scene  where some crewmen have their heads eaten by giant bugs.  People hated that scene also!  Also from the start of the overture music, this movie is very \\"hypnotic\\" and really holds your attention.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Listening to this album is like watching the plot unfold in a theatrical performance. She is truly masterful in all that she does and isn't afraid to be herself (see the inspirations from the album). This is one CD I never get tired of listening to. She really impressed me with her earlier releases, and didn't fail to take this album to the next level. The CD of itself jumps from quick and fast-paced funk and pop-inspired tunes to jazzy masterpieces, blending different genres, making it often difficult to label ArchAndroid--let alone, Janelle herself. I encourage anyone who is looking for something different, an awe-inspiring sound, and an authentic artist to check out this album and Janelle Monae as a whole.
1401216676|5.0|The product Í ordered was deliverd in a quick timeframe and in very good conditions. VEry good book, no wonder is the best batman book by many reviews.
0553801473|2.0|A spoiler or two below.<br /><br />Despite a handful of good moments (and a couple of great ones), my overall impression upon finishing the fifth volume in George RR Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga was: \\"Is that it?\\"<br /><br />I fear that the ability to write pretty prose is not enough to produce a good book, and in alarmingly frequent occasions here, even that talent seems to run away from Martin. Rather than serving the plot, stories meander for the sake of the timeline, and the seams in the fabric are all too evident. Two of the main POV characters are wasted. Tyrion is used as little more than a travel guide, while his genuinely interesting personality fades to the background. Daenerys devolves as a character, behaving like an irrational child for the first time in the series. Even back in the first book, as she was married off to Khal Drogo, Daenerys showed a strength of will that's nowhere to be found here. The work feels incomplete. Worse than that, it feels artificial.<br /><br />The introduction of the supposed Aegon Targaryen is interesting, but cheap. If he is truly who he claims to be, there should have been hints of his possible existence before the fifth book. If Martin will simply reveal him to be an impostor, this becomes incredibly manipulative storytelling, not to mention clumsy.<br /><br />The cliffhangers have been covered in enough reviews. Suffice to say that even as the middle part in a series, a book should offer some thematic resolution, at the very least. Instead, Martin chooses to skirt around the conflicts that had been brewing for the entire book, pushing them off to the next volume. Winterfell and Meereen are left unaddressed. Davos is in limbo. Jaime and Arya only get enough time for the reader to say \\"oh hey, there they are\\", and their chapters feel tacked on.<br /><br />Overall, the reading experience made me sad, and not for the characters. Added one star for good passages, but this is not a good book.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Ok, I've read the other reviews and understand why some people don't like it. The story line is not your typical romance movie, but this one rings way more true than most of the ones I've seen lately. I can also totally relate to Rachel who has always been the shy insecure girl in the shadows. This is a great movie that grabs your heart and makes your butterflies flutter again.  I absolutely love the actor, Colin, who plays Dex. He is a great talent, and I hope to see him in many more starring roles in the future. Please watch this movie. If you are disappointed, then maybe you are just too jaded to enjoy a beautiful love story.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I learned about the Kingkiller Chronicle series in one of the comments to a top-rated Amazon reader's review of  [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]].<br /><br />The commenter mentioned in his brief comment that Vol 1 was much better than Vol 2.<br /><br />Which almost discouraged me from starting the series. I mean who wants to read a series that starts out great then stumbles?<br /><br />Instead I really enjoyed reading Vol 1, and discovered that Vol 2 is even better!<br /><br />One reviewer here noted that this is a \\"character driven\\" novel and that is true.<br /><br />Yet there is plenty of action, without the action becoming mind-numbingly repetitive; lots of magic; a story about growing up; and hints of an epic battle of which this projected 3 volume series is the back story.<br /><br />There are two tests I use to rate my \\"good reads\\" - did I finish the book; and did I finish it quickly. Both volumes pass these tests with flying colors.<br /><br />The story within a story, of the land of the fae, is quite good, very close to the excellent standard set in [[ASIN:0765356155 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: A Novel]].  I think good writing should set a mood, drop you into the story as though you were watching a movie, or having a particular vivid, yet at the same time murky, dream, and the passages about the land of the fae have just that weirdly magical mood.<br /><br />The story of the Ademri, the martial arts and philosophy-driven people, is cut from the usual martial arts themes that for me began with Dune (Paul's training under his mother's tutelage), continued through the Asian martial arts craze, and persists today in our very topical fascination with commandos (Seal Team 6?) and other \\"real\\" super heroes.<br /><br />It \\"feels\\" as though the author has spent a fair amount of time immersing himself in magical literature, both fictional and \\"real\\" (the western occult tradition), and in martial arts and the eastern philosophy underpinning Asian martial arts. The Edema Ruh seem to echo the Gypsies of Europe blended with the troubador and bard traditions; the magic could be pulled (largely) from [[ASIN:0486447170 Agrippa's Occult Philosophy: Natural Magic (Dover Books on the Occult)]] and [[ASIN:0879800232 Concentration: A Guide to Mental Mastery]]; the martial arts from western fencing, tai chi, and Taoism.<br /><br />Yet while these themes echo \\"real\\" stuff in the \\"real\\" world, the author has created his own magical, medieval European-toned realm, sufficient and complete in itself, echoing the sources fairly accurately, imho, but not pedantically repeating them.<br /><br />In some ways he does for medieval European flavored, magically themed fantasy, rooted in realism (bruises hurt and bones break, conventions of romantic fiction are toyed with and discarded), what Dune did for science fiction: he makes it achingly real.<br /><br />If the series has one flaw, it is that there is only a single point of view, and while the other characters are well-realized and consistent, they aren't vivid in the way that George RR Martin's point of view characters seem to come alive. Yet the faery succubus is a richly realized character, as are enough other characters to hold your interest (beyond the obviously fascinating story of the narrator).<br /><br />My main criticism so far is that Denna, the hero's seeming Beatrice ([[ASIN:0451531396 The Inferno (Signet Classics)]]), gets rather boring by the end of Vol 2, while Demon Devi, a far more interesting character, gets short shrift (but not dismissal) at the end of Vol 2. I think Kvothe would have been much better off dallying with Devi than with Denna, but maybe the author will surprise us later by making Denna a more complex, and important, character. Oh one other criticism: the author recycles certain descriptive passages or summaries from time to time - it feels like he is using his computer to clip and paste. On the other hand this is exactlywhat oral tradition poets did - stock passages memorized and repeated to remind the audience where they were and who they were dealing with. See, for example,  [[ASIN:0195120329 Memory in Oral Traditions: The Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes]]; also [[ASIN:0521136717 Homer and the Oral Tradition]]. The recycled language is seldom disconcerting, except to remind you that the author is on a keyboard and not transcribing the text like Chronicler.<br /><br />There are good foreshadowings in both volumes; and unless it is a red-herring, Kvothe seems to come across a relative he SHOULD recognize but utterly fails to even consider. Auri, the sprite of the rooftops, continues to mystify (is she \\"just\\" a \\"cracked\\" former studen?).<br /><br />It looks like the third volume of this series will wrap up this coming of age story. And based on the quality of writing so far, it should be wrapped up nicely.<br /><br />Penguin is pricing the Kindle edition predatorily high. $15 for a downloaded, lightly formatted text? With no hardcovers underruns/overprintings to deal with? No shipping, inventory or other bricks and mortars costs to deal with? Incredibly lucrative for the publisher, and a sad \\"fan\\" penalty imposed on those of us who really don't want to wait for the paperback edition to pull down the cost of the Kindle edition.

0316017930|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this informative yet down to earth book about achievers.  Did not have to agree with every conclusion to both learn and appreciate the author's thoughts.  Maybe that was because I have always felt that environment and timing were key attributes of success.  Remember one individual who was reverred by many as a guru of entrepreneurism, who, after his first success, had a string of failures in later endeavors.  One of the reasons is that his first firm was timed perfectly for the market, while the others weren't.
B00000IQV7|5.0|I'm a huge fan or Robin Williams and have seen this movie in the past, decided to order it and add to my collecion.  Always just like seeing it for the first time, lots of emotions some happy some sad.
B000O14VAU|1.0|This movie has been described as an action romance loosely based on \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" by reviewers who either don't care about the actual content of the movie or haven't spent the money to see it. For those expecting a love story, look somewhere else. \\"Underworld\\" does indeed translate the background of Shakespeare's tragedy into sci-fi terms: the feuding Montagues and Capulets have become vampire and werewolf clans, and Romeo and Juliet themselves are supernatural killing machines. The difference between the 14th century Italian and 21st century gothic tales is that \\"Underworld\\" is composed of characters too tough and serious to ever express love. If Selene (vampire) and Michael (werewolf) are hiding their emotions, they are doing so in a manner too subtle to catch my attention. Luckily, numerous dialogues between Selene and her vampire kin have been placed to fill in the blanks as to her apparent affections, since the entire cast has caught on to what viewers will miss. By the time they make physical contact - an unexpected scene lasting under a minute - this element of the movie is no longer surprising or interesting. These characters have no chemistry together, and the supposed romance is hardly mentioned again in leu of more threatening problems.    For those of you who loved the style and swiftness of this movie but wanted more affection, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. \\"Underworld\\" ends with an obvious sequel offering, and the buzz is that this movie will again find inspiration in Shakespeare. Although the plot remains a mystery, \\"Underworld Crimson: Masquerade Werepocalypse\\" is expected to boast further historical depth into the warring vampire and werewolf clans as well as loosely mimic \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\"
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  While I like I don't love it like the Percy Jackson series or The Lost Hero series (even though there is only one book for it so far).  It took my almost a week to read this book because I got bored with it at times.  It wasn't until the last 150 pages or so that I could not put it down and had to finish.  I enjoyed it enough that I will read The Throne of Fire.  I do have to say that Mr. Riordan does know his gods history.  That is one thing that I love about his books.  While reading you can learn a bit of history/mythology as well.
140053271X|5.0|I've never been remotely interested in e-book readers, but I was stuck in Best Buy during a car installation for hours the other month and saw this device. It's just about the only time I've discovered something not by hype or searching for a product to fit my needs but by wandering upon it in an electronics store. After reading about the new reader for a few weeks, I decided to actually buy one.    At this point, I've found it to be a really excellent device and the only thing remotely \\"tablet\\" that's appealed to my needs. I find it easy to use with one of the first touch screen keyboards that recognizes my non-dainty mitts (I kind of hate touch screens as a rule). I feel like the makers of this device understand how ADD our society has made us, and most complaints about the firmware's limited capacity to check e-mail, surf the web, and play tiny games are music to my ears. I just want electronic paper... for reading.    Some bullet points about this e-reader, some of which stand it apart from competitors like the current Kindle:    * 215 grams  * No physical keyboard and low affinity of touch screen to oil  * Battery life (obviously) - leave the wi-fi off  * Maps true page numbers to print equivalent, should you cite or alternate between print and e-book  * Supports non-proprietary formats that can be downloaded from Project Gutenberg, torrent sites, etc.  * E-book library lending    It's one of the last things I mentioned, but the high compatibility of formats on the Nook is absolutely indispensable to me. I would never purchase a reader that required payment for content, just like I wouldn't mail publishers a check every time I borrowed a library book or a novel from a friend. Use your own morals. A big thanks to B&N for producing an intelligent device.

B004EPYZTE|3.0|Schwazenegger left the \\"Conan\\" role with some mighty big biceps to fill. Sad to say, Jason Momoa doesn't do the job. This movie had lots of great moments, like that hissing witch with the Electra complex, The Dweller (sashimi with an attitude), and the lovelies at the slave market. The leading lady was pretty good - savable enough for a hero to act heroic around, able to hold her own when given a chance, and charming as a participant in the couples' gymnastics.<br /><br />But, with flat acting, two-dimensional characters, harem pants (I think) on Conan, and dialog barely worth the name, there wasn't a terrible lot to make this memorable - except maybe the young Conan.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
0394800389|5.0|I buy this book for every kid I know. My kids used to want me to read it over and over. They wanted me to read it faster every time. It's quite a challenge. They are both grown now and still quote from it to this day. It is so fun to read and laugh together at the mistakes you make with this tongue twister.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this book for years, so my expectations were very high. Unfortunately this book fell short of my expectations. For the amount of pages it is, the amount of significant events was very slim. Jon dithered on the wall. Dany didn't know what to do and came across like a spoiled teenager. Tyrion wandered around but nothing really came of it except he got closer to maybe getting a chance to meet Dany. The book is called A Dance With Dragons but the dragons were nonexistent until late in book and even then played a minor role. The whole book comes off as a feet dragging segue into the real action that we will hopefully see in the next book. What prevented me from giving it it 2 stars was the prologue. Varys' monologue at the end sent chills up my spine!

B0052VI2V6|5.0|Get off the fence and snatch this one up !!!   This is the 2001 5.1 mix as originally issued in dvd-a format and it is stunning.  Immerse yourself in this classic like you have never heard it before on sacd.  The clarity, separation and lush sound will impress even the most skeptic of just how much we are missing without multi-channel mixes.  I would buy this one simply for the 5.1 mix of \\"Try and Love Again\\", now my favorite track on this timeless album.

B00406UK7S|3.0|Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and this is one of the best uses of 3D and the visuals are simply stunning in 3D.    However the story felt too rushed and has some very disturbing themes.
0307155102|5.0|Every time we read together, my grandson chooses this book.  He will pull it out from under stacks of other books.  The newest \\"sound\\" book or most original \\"open the door\\" book is left in the dust of this classic Richard Scarry offering.  My mother gave BEST WORD BOOK EVER to each grandchild through the years, and always heard from the parents that it was the favorite of all.  This generation will continue in that tradition.
B004EPYZTE|3.0|I love Conan/ Middle Earth type of movies, although for some reason the original Conan lacked appeal to me, perhaps because it looked like Arnold wore a wig the whole time. In this film we get a significant childhood view of Conan as a person who has more heart than brains. After his village is destroyed and his father killed, Conan wanders the earth to find the man and seek revenge.<br /><br />He comes to a town involved in slave trade, kills the traders and frees the topless women in a cage. Later soldiers show up and Conan deliberately gets himself arrested so he can get inside of the prison camp to get information. Of course armed guards are no match for a chained Conan.<br /><br />Conan is a barbarian, a Viking type. Another tribe appears to mimic Native Americans with Mohawks and another of the 12 tribes mimics Mongolian. The problem with Conan, the Barbarian is that he speaks as a barbarian with bad lines and a bad delivery. The CG specials effects make this a better film. There is a good supporting cast, however Conan himself was just written poorly. For most people this should just be a rental.<br /><br />No f-bombs, nudity, one poorly lit sex scene.

0307591549|5.0|Obtained MS in Counseling in 1986 and this is a book I will have in my office sitting on a shelf for frequent reference.  I bought both the book and the audiobook.  Listen to it at least once a week.  It was refreshing reading a book about psychology which was authored by a \\"young\\" person.  The book helps us understand how we react and deal with adversity.  Excellent suggestions for attitude improvement and dealing with everyday bumps in the road.  I own 30-40 \\"self-help\\" audiobooks and this is one of the best.

B004A8EI9M|3.0|I watched the entire season and i will say this... The first three episodes are great and exciting and then the last few episodes are painfully slow and uninteresting. Even with tempo aside, its just your average run of the mill zombie plot. How this has so many critics raving and 5 star reviews is beyond me. However i will say that i am looking forward to the upcoming season (with cautioned anticipation) because it still is after all a well made show in regards to production value and acting. Just work on the plot and lets give credit where credit is due.

B000KFB4PK|4.0|Jack and Trace both love these LEGO watches we gave them for their birthday in June (they are twins). Jack's broke after about an hour, and we were with him at the table. I think the manufacurer had not snapped it fully shut perhaps. But it truly was defective and not the result of abuse. We sent it back and within 6 days got a replacement AND our ship costs back. Superb. We have no idea if these are generally sturdy or problematic but after a couple of months now of both boys enjoying their watches we've had no further problems and the watches actually keep time EXTREMELY WELL without a lot of weekly or monthly adjusting so far.
B002N4DZ58|4.0|I just bought this performance out of curiosity and have listened to it twice, and then went back to \\"sniff\\" long time favorites I've owned for years, i.e. Furtwangler/Flagstad/Suthaus, Bohm/Windgassen/Nilsson, and Karajan/Vickers/Dernesch.  My reactions are that it is excellent but not all of a piece.  I give it four stars, as I think it's not overall quite up to the competition.<br /><br />It is incredible that Domingo sounds so youthful in his 60s in this set.  His voice sounds beautiful and, at least in the studio, he sings the role very well.  His manner of singing is Italianate and just DIFFERENT from what I am used to with the tenors named above.  So it's a struggle to adjust.  As always, he is very musical and enunciates well, though his diction doesn't match the native German speakers.  It's ironic that he sounds younger than any of the fellows mentioned above, despite being quite a bit older.  My issue is that he doesn't have the stage experience of having sung the role frequently in the heat of battle in front of live audiences;  to me his recording isn't a fully formed characterization; rather, it feels like an outstanding musician and singer reading the part.  I LOVE Domingo in Don Carlo and Trovatore precisely because he delivers real, integrated characterizations.<br /><br />Nina Stemme as Isolde has a very beautiful, womanly, warm sound.  It's strong on top and her high notes are excellent.  She's not in the Nilsson class with the high notes, but who is?  Those who dislike Nilsson because of her \\"metallic\\" timbre may like Stemme very much.  I am bothered a bit by a seeming inconsistency in her sound and performance.  I am not sure whether it is the miking, the effect of piecing together a performance from many takes, or something else.  I hear dramatic volume and distance variations that seem not to have anything to do with what Wagner wrote.  There are various places where Flagstad and Nilsson deliver long, quite seamless lines, but Stemme does not.  The overall impression is less than what the first few minutes of the first act led me to expect.  In spite of all this, her characterization is effective and I like her overall.<br /><br />The Brangaene is young sounding.  I like her.  Olaf Bar as Kurwenal is not quite to my taste.  It sounds like he decided to play the role as a blustering tough guy who's protecting Tristan.  As a result the listener gets some snarling with the singing.  Good for him to try to do something different with the role, but I'd rather hear it sung straight.  Give me the young Fischer-Dieskau from the Furtwangler set anytime.  Rene Papp as King Marke is very good.<br /><br />The orchestra tone is quite fine and the recording is detailed, but does sound less reverberant (i.e. drier) than the three classic sets mentioned at the top.  In other words, it does not measure up to the winner for sound - Bohm at Bayreuth.  The sheen on the Bayreuth sound is sensational.  Listen to the quiet beginning of Act 3 with Tristan and Kurwenal and the difference is blatant.  There is also  some strange miking here and there.  For example, in the 2nd act love duet there's one spot where Stemme comes out of one speaker and Domingo out of the other as if they are far apart on the stage.  These are lovers besotted with each other.  Why did the engineers think it would be effective for them to be singing to each other at 20 paces, for heaven's sake?<br /><br />Pappano's performance is one of the quicker Tristans, just 6 min slower than Bohm.  Bohm feels like he's really pushing things in a few spots in Act 1, whereas Pappano does not feel that way.  However, Bohm and especially Furtwangler feel more integrated and do much more with the long line than Pappano.<br /><br />Overall, it's a worthy set but it's a second or third version once you have Furtwangler, Karajan or Bohm and would like to hear an alternative approach.impression is less than what the first few minutes of the first act led me to expect.

B004EPZ0BQ|5.0|This has been a magical summer for movies. A lot of movies that I was really looking forward to, have turned out to be lousy. However, I've seen a lot of movies that I expected to be awful, but ended up being really good. Thus, \\"Friends With Benefits\\". Romantic comedies are always awful for me. I love them, but they make me feel like crap. The reason why this is, is because most of them are dishonest, and make you feel like only in the movies, things work out in love. \\"Friends With Benefits\\" is refreshingly honest, kind of sad, yet hopelessly optimistic. Its dialogue is fast and quick, kind of \\"Juno\\"-esque.     Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are both coming off Oscar roles. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good in \\"The Social Network\\", as was Kunis in \\"Black Swan\\". Maybe it was a fluke that both of them were so good in those movies, but this is the kind of movie they belong in. Their characters, Dylan and Jamie, have personalities, and characteristics that mesh with each other in a really awesome way, which doesn't come very often in romantic comedies.    The story, as for most romantic comedies, isn't surprising at all. It's two people who are coming out of bad relationships, who meet in a classic cute romantic comedy way, and decide that relationships don't work out, and to remain \\"friends with benefits\\", or friends who (constantly) have sex. As you could imagine, this doesn't work out the way they had hoped. There was a similar movie released this January, with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher called \\"No Strings Attached\\", which, clearly will be referenced in most, if not all reviews for \\"Friends With Benefits\\". I, admittedly, didn't hate that movie. But it's a piece of dreck compared to this one.    It's a typical hour-and-forty-five minute romantic comedy. However, it's kind of this generation's \\"When Harry Met Sally\\". It's \\"When Dylan Met Jamie\\". The two leads are so great with each other, one the yin to the other's yang. You can tell that they would beconceivable as a real couple. They aren't the perfect, immediately compatible couple that usually headlines a movie such as this. Justin Timberlake keeps proving that he's a better actor than a lot of pop stars. He's insanely likable in this movie. Mila Kunis had a smaller, haunting kind of role in \\"Black Swan\\", where I thought she was above average. She's really allowed to shine in this one, bringing life to a character that could have been much less. The attitude of this movie is sometimes gritty, always quick, witty, and urban. It makes good use of the time it's given. It acknowledges the ridiculous romantic comedies that it could have been. Jamie and her friend, at one point, walk by a poster for Katherine Heigl's \\"The Ugly Truth\\", and says \\"Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!\\". A fake in-movie-movie, with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, is meant to emphasize how ridiculous most romantic comedies are. Great stuff.    Another thing this one has that \\"No Strings Attached\\" didn't have is a great supporting cast. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamie's mother, a hippie lush who is really damn funny. Woody Harrelson also does a good job as Dylan's unapologetically bold and hilarious gay boss. He gets kudos for not making a gay character a stereotype. Richard Jenkins plays Dylan's Alzheimer's stricken father, and Jenna Elfman plays his sister. They add to the quick and zippy feel of the movie. Cameos by Emma Stone and Andy Samberg are always welcome, too.    While some probably won't like this one as much as I did, I liked all of its characters. I felt like each character was well-developed and interesting. The quick writing is what makes it better than a lot of similar movies, but when everything in it is mashed together, the whole package is very good. I look forward to watching it again.    Grade: A-
0312958455|5.0|I loved this book.  Harry does what he needs to do now that he has the sudden time to do it.  The unsolved murder of his mother still haunts him and drives him, and to solve it can be risky for different reasons.  It's a tragic story as we follow Harry's discoveries of his mother's plan to leave the life, just so she'd get him back, and the horrible discovery that it was an old friend who committed the murders.<br /><br />Harry's character develops a lot in this story and so much of his past with his mother is touching and so tragic. I highly recommend this book it is one of Michael Connelly's best.<br /><br />A.M Torres Author of Love Child.

B001P3SA94|2.0|This movie was good but the main leads were cast wrong. First there were two Chess brothers not one. Second (and bare in mind that I love jeffrey Wright as an actor) but he was all wrong for Muddy Waters. Especially considering that had him sing his own parts. Jeffrey can hold a tune but he doesnt have real soul pipes. And how powerful Muddy's voice was is not really shined on in the movie b/c Jeffrey can't carry the right tone. But he can act and he pulled off the dramatic part its just that with that voice you never buy him as Muddy Waters. Secondly, Beyonce can't act. She can sing but she can't act and watching her try to be dynamic is just pityful.  Now the good things: Mos Def, Columbus Short, Cedric the Entertianer, and Eamon Walker nail their roles as Chuck Berry, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, and Howlin' WOlf. The problem is that they werent the main characters and the movie was anchored on Jeffrey Wright and Beyonce. And there was too much story to cram into a movie. A mini series would have been better or maybe a really detailed documentary  Lastly, if you've never heard the music before then the covers by Wright, SHort, Walker etc might be satisfying BUT once you hear the originals then you'll know how much injustice was done by having these guys try and cover that music. I mean it really is awful. But the movie does introduce people to Chicago Blues and the men that laid the foundation for Rock n Roll

B004XKMEK2|4.0|On the Floor. It was the shot heard round the world, or at the least the dance floor. A less-than-frantic, perfectly paced gem of pop nirvana, it's the type of song anyone could really sing, and it may have sounded better coming from another. But as it stands, the song added all the traction necessary for 'Love?', Jennifer Lopez's newest and best album. The collection follows the blueprint that On the Floor promised, only venturing occasionally away from dance tracks produced by the heavy hitters an artist like Jennifer was lucky enough to net for the project.    'Love?' is both incredibly cohesive yet inconsistent at the same time. When the dance numbers hit, they bang hard; On the Floor will be a classic club jam for the next five years. Papi thumps and whizzes with an explosive energy that sets the foundation for the equally strong Invading My Mind and the flawless Hypnotico. This quartet, spread evenly throughout the album, make up the finest moments.    When Jennifer ventures toward more R&B-influenced producers, she has less success. Good Hit is autotuned into extinction, Run the World could learn from On the Floor about making the most of its tempo, and Villain sparks but never catches fire. The bonus tracks are all eclipsed by Hypnotico, although Everybody's Girl and Charge Me Up do a fine job of earning a spot on the basic tracklisting over some of the weaker tracks.    The trinity of ballads are the most surprising part of the album. They aren't just good, but actual highlights, a rare feat on a dance pop album. Jennifer sounds genuinely nervous on (What Is) Love?, injects the chorus of 'Until It Beats No More' with a breathless devotion, and gets autobiographical on Starting Over. It balances out the dance tracks masterfully.    In conclusion, Jennifer has created a fine album. The highs and too high and the lows not quite low enough to make it middle of the road. If you're looking for a pop album that makes for a good time, 'Love?' can do just that.    Highlights: Papi, Until It Beats No More, Invading My Mind, Hypnotico

1449512569|5.0|Recognizing that Chesterson's Orthodoxy appeared in numerous lists of \\"books to read\\", and granting the premise that it is therefore a worthwhile book to obtain, I decided to get a copy and give it a try. Immediately, the question became - which version to purchase? I quickly found that on Amazon there are no less than 45 paperback editions available (some are almost certainly duplicates, but still), and 12 hardcover versions. There are even 6 different Kindle versions!<br /><br />Such is the quandary for books in the public domain; every print-on-demand operation can offer it up, and how do you know which ones are good quality and which are not? I have read enough Amazon reviews complaining of poor quality books, some that seem to be scanned and not proof-read and thus contain numerous spelling and other errors, others missing entire pages, that I was very very hesitant to try anything other than an edition from Penguin or Oxford Classics or other comparable reliable publishers.<br /><br />When I discovered this \\"Centennial Edition\\" (good marketing, that), and did some checking, I was satisfied that it was worth trying out. I have not been disappointed. I have the book in front of me as I type this review, and I can report that it is a very good quality book, well produced, and to me it is indistinguishable from a book printed by a \\"traditional\\" publisher. This is not a bare-bones, simple printing of the book. It is perfectly typeset, well designed and attractive, and with a very nice style to the production. It is in all respects completely satisfactory.<br /><br />If you are looking for an edition of Orthodoxy, that is a reasonably priced and high quality paperback, I can recommend without hesitation that you purchase this edition.<br /><br />(The publisher, Sam Torode Book Arts, is not shown by Amazon as the publisher; rather \\"CreateSpace\\" is listed, as they are the print-on-demand publisher utilized by Torode. There are several other books by Chesterton available on Amazon that are produced by this same designer/publisher.

B0000029AL|5.0|This album is truly a classic to behold within the confines of 70's Hard Rock. I'm forever a fan of 70's era Aerosmith and this debut is merely a first step for Tyler, Perry, Whitford, Kramer and Hamilton in which to project and prove themselves as a classic, great American Rock band. Make it and Somebody are good openers in which to display what the roots of the band are and also what their respective defining sound as an ensemble is capable of. The guitar duo of Tyler/Whitford is not unlike Peter Green/Danny Kirwan(Fleetwood Mac) in that both guitarists are just as capable of trading off rhythm and lead guitar duties as well as trading lead licks together. Steven Tyler's comparable to an American Mick Jagger even down to his style and vocal delivery, yet, has a voice of his own on tracks like Write Me, Make It and the album's centerpiece One Way Street. One Way Street shows off the group's jamming style and the sound of the band is deep rooted in British blues/rock ala the Yardbirds, the Stones and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.    Dream On actually didn't hit with the masses until a few years after as the anthem for the group and it is a well written number that shows another facet of what Aerosmith was capable of musically. Walkin' the Dog is a cover of a cover originally done by blues singer Rufus Thomas and is a fine track that has the band alive and cookin'. Other songs worth of mention are Mama Kin and Movin' Out which with the former features a bouncy upbeat rocker that would remain a concert favorite and the latter that has some great twisted guitar leads from Perry/Whitford backed by the powerhouse rhythm section of Joey Kramer and Tom Hamilton. When I began learning guitar, this album was one of many that inspired me to want to learn much about the instrument, and even to this day, I still refer back to some of these tracks as absolute musts for any young beginners to build up their chops within the knowledge of the guitar. And for the newer generations ofAerosmith fans, if you haven't checked out this fantastic debut, what are you waiting for? This is where it all began. 5 Solid Stars
B004HHKFIY|5.0|I just bought this train this morning for my son. It's awesome...both my kids have been wanting to get chugginton but I was reluctant to buy another train set. I was so surprised to see a wooden version of this train in the bookstore, I bought one and the lady standing next to me also bought one. My kids haven't stopped playing with it. I have the Thomas beginners wooden set, Thomas travel sets, the Dinosaur train plastic set, the learning curve wooden table set and the geotrax portable zoo. So its always a bonus when I don't have to buy another entire set when my sons fancy a new train. I really appreciate the manufactures making the compatible with the other wooden sets.     It's durable, the colour is brillant and there are no sharp pointy edges. It is slightly larger than Thomas but the wheel base fits the wooden tracks perfectly. It also has the magnetic connectors that connects the freight cars which works well with Thomas and the other trains.     Kudos to you Learning Curve!     Sincerely,  A mother of two boys (2 and 3 years old)!

B001R4MEYS|4.0|\\"Oblivion\\" starts off like a Metallica song, then bursts out into Mastodon, not really going anywhere interesting. It's a catchy song, though, and the guitar solo is very ice. \\"Divinations\\" starts off with some `country yokel' ukelele, but then gets moving quickly into the standard \\"100 riffs\\" formula that Mastodon has, going quickly into scary lyrics turf, but the song is not murderous. It is also the shortest on the CD, and has a zining guitar solo. \\"Quintessence\\" has the killer opening riff that you'd expect from Mastodon, and it moves in, but doesn't get fun. It is a boring pop song. \\"The Czar: I. Usurper II. Escape III. Martyr IV. Spiral\\" is a dirge of sorts, and it boils in the midst of kooky Russian imagery for what seems like a long time, but then it gets insanely good as the movement of the song shifts higher and higher. Great sound, great production, great riffs!!! The song grinds on and on, always pushing a hard course. \\"Ghosts of Karelia\\" opens with a great riff and thunderous drumming, and it just keeps up throughout. \\"Crack The Skye\\", the title track, blasts open with those arpeggio riffs, grooving along, then going into a regular rock song (nothing too ferocious here, right?). Hearing space vocals... is this Mastodon or Daft Punk? Interesting, though! \\"The Last Baron\\" is a very long song of 13 glorious minutes, good stuff. But isn't this band suddenly a bit too melodic, and a bit too un-scary? But the song is great in its insanity, which manifests itself deep into the last song, with its stunning moods. It's the best song on the album.<br /><br />The DVD shows the making of \\"Crack The Skye\\" and you get to find out a bit about what the band's all about. Guitarist Bill Kelliher is a major Star Wars fan, has a room full of the figurines (still in their boxes) that he gives a brief tour of. He also often wears Star Wars t-shirts. The other guitarist Bent Hinds, who's a bit goofy/loopy since his brain hemorrhage (he's also the only potbellied rockstar that I can think of) is a major Creature From The Black Lagoon fan, and tours his Creature swag. They talk about the difference in the recording process - \\"Blood Mountain\\" had been recorded over two months of torture when the band was living in a hotel room in Seattle, \\"Crack The Skye\\" was recorded in their home town of Atlanta. Drummer Brann Dailor is a Cadillac fan, looks bored in sessions. Rehearsed album in their jam space before entering the studio, they were more prepared lyrically and vocally. They now have the money to invest in equipment, love old gear. Played a 1964 Stratocaster through a 1968 purple Marshall JMP 100 watt head. Brann has a cool black velvet Bruce Lee painting, also a black velvet sad clown. He talks seriously about Skye, his sister, who committed suicide when she was 14 and he was 15, the album is in a way named after her, but is not about her. In a stupid sequence, he starts to tell what the album is about, but then turns on a lawnmower and pushes it around, so of course you can't hear a thing. \\"Oblivion\\" is about leaving your body, going out too far, getting burned, getting lost, a metaphor for leaving home, a metaphor for the band about leaving and letting the soul ascent as it goes near the sun. \\"Sometimes you just have to close your eyes, grab your balls, and think of the 1970s.\\" The band talks about how they wanted to make a prog rock album, and sure enough, some parts of it sound very Yes-like.hink of) is a major Creature From The Black Lagoon fan, and tours his Creature swag.

B0000084J7|5.0|Mark Hollis released his only solo album so far in 1998, seven years after the final Talk Talk album \\"Laughing Stock\\", and it's simply called \\"Mark Hollis.\\" On the cover is a strange picture of a pasty that has haunting, sad eyes... it looks alive. The black and white photo is framed in white, and the whole booklet is simply lyrics and very simple production details.<br /><br />The first song is called \\"The Colour Of Spring\\", which is of course also the name of their third release from 1986. After 18 seconds of silence, the song starts with simple piano chords and the gorgeous, pleading voice of Mark Hollis. \\"Watershed\\" is a beautiful song with the fractured accordions, percussion, light guitar and basswork, and (as always) very dominated by the vocals. \\"Inside Looking Out\\" is mainly guitar and voice, and is haunting. This is the only song on the album solely-written by Hollis. \\"The Gift\\" is a full band, and moves along more quickly, with faster drums, strange sounds, and that odd harmonica howl from time to time. It fades out abruptly with goofy bassoon work, and the next song, \\"A Life (1895-1915)\\" fades in with that all-over-the-place quasi-classical blurting stuff, which continues, then with voice, and percussion comes in finally after about three minutes, when the wind instruments fall away and the guitar starts to swell, Hollis turns the vocal duties over to half-murmuring half-singing children's voices. Beautiful. This is the longest song on the release, 8:10, it is an extremely complex song that goes through several movements, and after the children's voices you get keyboard and double bass, then weird windworks, then some sort of a strange fade-out. \\"Westward Bound\\" is only guitar and Hollis' haunting voice. \\"The Daily Planet\\" is more like a full on song - it starts with bassoon doodling for a minute, but then picks up with a drum beat that moves the song along slowly, the voice comes in after 2.5 minutes with those haunting vocals, there's some great harmonica work. \\"A New Jerusalem\\" moves right along, with piano chords, guitar and vocals, but near the middle it peters out and becomes a whispering, still, moody statement, Hollis' last so far. The last 90 seconds of the song are silence.. \\"A New Jerusalem\\" moves right along, with piano chords, guitar and vocals, but near the middle it peters out and becomes a whispering, still, moody statement, Hollis' last so far.

B003UTUQ3E|5.0|I am a sucker for box sets. I didn’t need to get this so badly, since I am quite familiar with ever second song on this CD (”Golden Years”, “TVC 15″ and “Wild Is The Wind” would be on any Bowie compilation or greatest hits release; “Station To Station”, “Word On A Wing” and “Stay” are new songs to me). But the two-CD concert that is on this is stunning, and Bowie’s touring band is amazing! For the studio release, there are seven musicians (including three guitarists – Bowie himself is credited with “vocals, guitars, tenor and alto saxophone, Moog and mellotron”), whereas live he only sang, working instead with two guiarists, Carlos Alomar, who had been in the studio band, and new guitarist Stacey Heydon. They also toured without a piano player. The tour was called the Isolar Tour, but it was quickly referred to as the Station To Station Tour, or the White Light Tour. The booklet for the box is okay – a short opening essay by Cameron Crowe tries to paint a picture, but eventually confesses “The details of the recording remain enigmatic to this day. The artist himself has little to say about it. When pressed in a 2006 interview, he remembered few details from the sessions.” Great. What we do know is that this is a period in his life when he was using a lot of drugs, was getting paranoid, encountering “spiritual frenzy”, producing demos for Iggy Pop, filming “The Man Who Fell To Earth” for Nicholas Roeg, and preparing for a 64-date tour of Canada, the US, Central Europe and the UK that took him to 49 cities in four months. Wow.<br /><br />While the booklet may be a bit skimpy on details of this difficult and creative period for Bowie, the outside source-referenced Wikipedia entry on the Station to Station does provide more details:<br /><br />According to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based Bowie, fuelled by an “astronomic” cocaine habit and subsisting on a diet of peppers and milk, spent much of 1975–76 “in a state of psychic terror”.[3] Stories—mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into Playboy and Rolling Stone—circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient-Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his semen stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from The Rolling Stones, and living in morbid fear of fellow Aleister Crowley aficionado Jimmy Page.[1] Bowie would later say of L.A., “The place should be wiped off the face of the earth”.<br /><br />The CD set also includes some nice pictures in the booklet, and there’s a timeline of events from May 1975 to May 1976. It’s all Bowie all the time – the only picture of the back is an audience view from the drum riser that shows everyone’s backs (it’s a great shot, though, and is also used across the 2CD inner gatefold. No lyrics, but some nice big colour photos of Bowie on cards.<br /><br />The opening track of the studio album, with its long 3:20 buildup (the whole song is 10:15) is mesmerizing, as are the opening lyrics “The return of the Thin White Duke…”, it foes on and on and is a lot of fun with its funky grooves, its piano, its touches of electronica, and a superb Bowie vibe. “Golden Years” is the good retro fun that we all know and love. “Word on a Wing” is glorious Bowie operatic vocalosity, while “TVC 15″ rocks and rolls, with its goofy six opening “oh-oh-oh-oh-oh”. Probably the funkiest song on the release is “Stay”, with its groovy percussion and its two minute-long closing guitar jam-out (and its lack of saxophone – thank you, David, for showing restraint here). “Wild Is The Wind”, the emotional Nina Simone cover that closes the studio release, needs no introduction.<br /><br />The concert, like the album it supports, opens with “Station To Station”, the band wringing it out here to nearly 12 minutes long. It openings to blistering feedback guitar, before phasing into the long opener we’re familiar with, stretched now to 4:30. The song is a funk fest, with the last three minutes a nice jam-out. It’s the longest song in the concert. “Suffragette City”, “Fame”, the “Life on Mars” and “Five Years” medley, “Panic in Detroit”, a boring version of “Changes” with Bowie cutting up in the intro, Diamond Dogs”, a not-so-great “Rebel Rebel” and “The Jean Genie” are pretty conventional versions. “Panic in Detroit” (with its not-so-great drum solo, but a nice guitar solo and a bit of a bass solo) makes it the better version of the older songs, the end of which Bowie introduces the band, adding “a Canadian, but a guitarist nonetheless, Stacey Heydon”. Ha ha ha… “Stay”, with its wicked guitar funk is stupendous, and the long outro is a vision to behold. It’s also the closest David Bowie will get to writing a new theme song for Shaft. The Velvet Underground’s “Waiting For The Man” is a bit odd in a funkified version, but it’s good fun nonetheless, with a bit of lyrical improv to spice it up a bit. “TVC15″ is interesting with its party atmosphere in the intro, but that and the rest of the songs on the discs, “Diamond Dogs”, “Rebel Rebel” and “The Jean Genie” are all pretty straight forward.a nice jam-out.

I only wish there were more of this band at their peak, and for that matter for many other artists of that time.

B004HO6I4W|4.0|Most of this movie is exceptionally well done.  The music, the animation, the voice selections, most scenes and more surpassed my expectations.  I saw it in the movie theater and found it good enough to buy the Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy version 3 pack because the price was right.  Definitely a movie both kids and adults can enjoy.  This Blu-Ray version is excellent.  The surround sound is superb and Blu-ray looks fantastic on my TV.     But missing is something that I can't quite put my figure on. It me keeps it from calling it a classic for all times.  The scenes at the end, or the last five minutes or so, seem rushed and not quite right.  Once all the issues of the plot are resolved, the movie has a feeling of just wanting to get it all over to keep it within a certain time.  I think with a little more thought and about 5-10 more minutes of expanding what happens to the characters at the end would have done it.  But that did not happen. Since the wrapping up of the film leaves the last impression that is what I'm left with, an impression of a very good film that gets almost everything right but just barely misses the mark of being a classic.
0451197968|3.0|Published in 1982 under the pseudonym, Richard Bachman, the author was strangely prescient, as the novel takes place in the year 2025 in the good old United States of America, only it is not so good anymore. With an economy that sharply divides the haves and the have nots, reality television is the only thing that brings these two disparate halves of the economy together.<br /><br />Twenty something Ben Richards is living with his wife and baby girl in a ramshackle housing development in dire poverty. He is at the end of his rope. His wife is turning tricks to keep them barely alive, and their baby girl is dying from the flu for lack of proper medical care and medication. Theirs is truly miserable existence.<br /><br />The only entertainment for those such as them is Free-Vee, which delivers non-stop reality television shows in which desperate wretches try to win big monetary payoffs. Desperate for money to be able to help his little girl, Ben auditions for a reality television show and is selected for the ultimate life or death reality show, where the truly desperate are hunted down by a group called the \\"Hunters\\", whose only mission is to kill their quarry. The payoff is big, should one succeed in evading death, but no one ever has.<br /><br />Such is the desperation of Ben Richards that he would even consider signing on for such a show. Unfortunately for him, he soon realizes that there is a reason no one has ever succeeded in evading the \\"Hunters\\" and decides that it is time that someone changes the status quo. That someone will be him, as he turns the show on its head.<br /><br />The book is definitely bleak in its outlook and pretty depressing. There is virtually no character development of anyone other than the protagonist, and even there that is somewhat limited. This book was supposedly written in three days by the author, and it shows in the quality of the writing.<br /><br />Still, the story line was intriguing, and certainly the author was onto something, as who knew in 1982 that reality shows would have such a hold on the public, as they do today? It is simply too bad that the story, as written, has little emotional grip on the reader, rendering it somewhat less than satisfying.  Nonetheless, fans of the author will find some enjoyment in this somewhat mediocre book. A word to the wise, do not read the author's intro \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" until after you have read the book,  if  you want to avoid knowing  how \\"The Running Man\\" ends before you read the book., as who knew in 1982 that reality shows would have such a hold on the public, as they do today?

I'm not even really sure what language surfing is, but it's a bit like entering the Matrix and seeing what's going to happen. I wrote it to be a preposterous as possible and I wrapped it up neat and nice, even if not everything made sense.<br /><br />The film Inception uses the same logic, and I think that the director is taking the piss out of all of us with a preposterous tale of entering people's dreams and influencing their thinking. I thought that this was one of the stupidest films I've ever seen, and the plot was so totally preposterous I simply could not suspend my disbelief any longer. Architects who create dream worlds! Dreamers who go under for 50 years! Car chases inside a man's brain! Executives that can buy off justice! Ambushes in Tangiers! Cities that fold like slices of pizza! Wowee!!<br /><br />The way it was all neatly wrapped up in a happy ending in the last two minutes, with the ironic twist of the spinning top thingy, was also hard to take. What did we just sit through for two hours? People take this film really seriously and think about what it means. I guess they're a lot deeper than me...
B0026P3G12|2.0|I wrote this same review for the Jackie Evancho album \\"Dream With Me\\". I will simply paste that review here.    I recently got two CDs from Amazon, both produced by SYCO Music and distributed through Sony Music. One was the Jackie Evancho CD \\"Dream With Me\\" and the other was the Susan Boyle CD \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\". I enjoy both singers tremendously so my comments have nothing to do with their singing or the musical choices made on each disk. What I am complaining about is the poor technical quality of both recordings. I play back Cds through a mid-fi system with inexpensive but multiple award winning speakers driven by a Tripath 2050 type amp that is known for its clarity, soundstage, and airiness. The definition of this system is excellent. I hear everything that is on the CD, even ultra low volume sounds like a telephone ringing in the background or people mumbling in the audience on live recordings. It provides excellent reproduction of well recorded music. With a well recorded CD, the speakers just disappear and the performer is righ there in your living room. That is why I was so surprised when I put on the Jackie Evancho CD for the first time! The recording engineer did a horrible job, in my opinion. I did not like the miking. Jackie sounded like she was standing 3 or 4 feet behind the microphone. Whenever she hit a high note with any power, it sounded like the microphone overloaded and there was a tinny transient rather reminiscent of the sound of a tissue and comb! The same thing occurred in the duet with Susan Boyle. Ms. Boyle's voice created the same transient. Thinking this might be my system, I took off the Jackie Evancho album and tried the Susan Boyle album. The same thing occurred! Now I was really worried that something might be wrong with the system. Then I noticed that the Boyle album was from the same studio as the Evancho album! I proceeded to drag out a number of disks covering the music spectrum: singers, operatic and pop, both male and female;acoustic jazz; driving rock music; full orchestral works both classical and popular. These were all disks that I'd heard many times and knew well. Everything sounded wonderful as they all had previously done. So I knew it wasn't the system but the CDs provided by SYCO/Sony. To determine if this problem exists with all these recordings or is limited to perhaps a bad production run, I am going to try to borrow a copy of the Evancho or Boyle CD from friends who may have them. I will listen to their copy on my system. If it sounds OK, I will know it is a production run problem and return my copies for replacement.

Why on Earth would someone bring children into this world that they had no intention of raising themselves, only to schlep them off on to a nanny at the earliest possible convenience?

Reading this book was like being in a classroom setting, there was a lot of straight to the point facts & tips. I love Scott's personality & jokes he throws into the book it gets you thinking & was more enjoyable to read. I've bought other books & got bored reading just text book like material & not helping me get the results I want out of my camera.

The Testament is the first where Grisham appears to experience project boredom, allowing well written nature scenes to overtake the main story, dragging us thru too much mess and in too prolonged a style related to the Phelan heirs, and somewhat abruptly dropping us to an ending as though he suddenly had something else to move on to.

B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|David Coverdale is one of the best rock singers.  Period.  Combine that with Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach tearing it up on guitar, and you have a lethal line-up for a band that has always delivered the goods.  Whitesnake have been my favorite band since I saw them live in 1988.  I had the enormous pleasure of seeing them on tour for this album, and they still are one of the best live bands in rock.    Forevermore is Whitesnake's 2011 new studio album.  Apparently, Coverdale had not planned a new album this soon, but his label nudged him.  After some writing sessions with Aldrich, Coverdale felt that the material was indeed strong, so they proceeded with the recording.    In my opinion, the result is the best studio Whitesnake album, or indeed Coverdale album, since 1989's Slip of the Tongue.  The new rhythm section of Brian Tichy and Michael Devin bring a tightness to the group and enhance the chemistry.  Furthermore, the backing vocals are some of Whitesnake's best ever.  Coverdale belts out the songs with aggression, emotion and passion, and tones it down when the material calls for it.    I'm not blown away by the mix on this one, but it is better than Good To Be Bad, as far as mixes go.  Bad mixes have long been the weak point of Coverdale's material.  Such a shame, as the material is mind-blowing.    The mix, however, does not detract enough to diminsih my review of this album.  The songwriting is genius, inspired.  Beach and Aldrich are great guitarists, and all the performance elements could hardly be better.  I can also say, from firsthand experience, that the songs explode live.    My favorite song, hands down, is the epic title track, which reminds me of the brilliant \\"Sailing Ships\\" from Slip of the Tongue.  I get goose bumps from it.      This is classic rock at its finest, and I doubt that anyone who enjoys blues-based, radio-friendly, hard-edged arena rock will be disappointed.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|\\"Disintegration\\" has been the only Cure studio release that I ever bought close to its release (I've only ever bought packages, such as the \\"Standing on the Beach\\"/\\"Staring at the Sea\\" compilation, and the Connect the Dots box set), so when this was released as a set with demos and the full \\"Entreat\\" live show I thought it would be a good one to get. The booklet has a short essay describing what the band went through in the recording, such as kicking the useless Lol Tolhurst out of the band, or allowing him to leave, or whatever happened; it also talks about how they saved the lyrics from a deadly fire, the band forming a human chain, wrapping wet towels around their heads and shoulders, and then groping around a smoke-filled room to retrieve the already-smouldering leather satchel with the only copy of the lyrics in it - whew! There are a bunch of pictures from the era - man, were those guys ugly. Vocals for the 12 studio songs (but none of the singles) are included.<br /><br />The songs on the studio release are all as good as I remember, although somehow they are a bit shabby, pale, boring. Not quite what I remembered, exactly, although the later songs are a bit nicer than the earlier songs. I was quite surprised when I got to the live show, which was from a show at Wembley Stadium in July of 1989 that represents all 12 songs on Disintegration, that I actually liked it better than the studio version. I was surprised, because usually it's the other way around, where the live recording bugs me for some reason or other, I nearly always prefer the studio album... just not this time.<br /><br />The second disc doesn't really excite that much either, although it has its moments. It includes three Robert Smith home demos, nine band demo instrumentals, two studio rough instrumentals, four studio roughs with guide vocals, one rough mix with vocals and one Robert Smith solo rough mix with vocals. Seems that the band went through two rounds of laying down the instrumentals, a process that lasted from about April to October. Taken together they chart the whole recording process of the album. Listening to the instrumentals can be a bit trying at times, but it also shows how interesting the music can be (even when it drones on and on) without the distraction - pleasant though it may be - or Robert Smith's unique voice. It's also fitting, since the album is known for its long instrumental sections anyway.<br /><br />First off: the demos that Robert Smith did at home before he added the vocals, which are sort or like rough karaoke tracks. \\"Prayers For Rain\\" sounds like it's been programmed into hell, and there are three such demos. \\"Fascination Street\\" sounds weird with a bit of slide guitar and keyboard thrown on top of the mix. There are also band rehearsals. The one for \\"Homesick\\" sounds just that - it's awful. Other band rehearsals are \\"Closedown\\", \\"Lovesong\\", \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\", and \\"Disintegration\\". \\"Lovesong\\" has really weird bass sounds. There are also B-sides \\"Fear Of Ghosts\\", which sounds like some sort of a weird early Cure icy poker repeating its tracks over and over, \\"Noheart\\", which starts out with wicked drums and noise and then a creepy dirge with cheap keyboard sounds, \\"Esten\\", which is jaunty and cheerful and a lot of fun, and \\"2 Late (alternate version)\\", a gorgeous and textured number that has that \\"Monday I'm In Love\\" spring in its stride. \\"Babble\\" is a fun tune, bass-driven with prominent keyboards and drums, here in its instrumental version. Other studio roughs have vocals and sound a lot like the final album versions. \\"Out of Mind\\" is keyboard-led and it sort of grooves, it also has hard rock guitar (!?!) in it. It's a lot less murky than the final B-side version, and it has great Robert Smith vocals. \\"Delirious Night\\" is jaunty and drum-led, it sort of grooves on and on and on and has really strange vocals. \\"Pirate Ships\\" is a Judy Collins cover that Robert Smith did for a planned 40th anniversary Elektratribute album that never happened so it never got used, and appears here for the first time. It is a strange little ditty, with Robert Smith singing over accordion sounds, with the sound of surf to accompany it. I can't find this song on YouTube, my ersatz jukebox; I wonder what the original sounded like.r happened so it never got used, and appears here for the first time.

B004XCUEXY|5.0|This Doc is awesome. I love how it delves into Nirvana among other things. It's so well done. I already watched it one and a half times and for a documentary thats impressive. You can actually watch this over and over again with time. It's really interesting to see the band evolve over the years. I mean whoever thought this band would have all these albums and sell out arenas let alone stadiums. I mean Dave was the drummer for Nirvana and look how far he took his band the Foo Fighters to. You really have to give him credit and it really shows Kurt wasn't the only true talent for Nirvana.
B001NS9BCQ|5.0|A friend introduced me to Yngwie about four months before this album came out by playing Rising Force for me.  I loved Rising Force so much that I bought this album the day it came out (on cassette, of course).  From the thunderous opening of the song Rising Force, I was in awe of Yngwie's talent as a writer, producer and player.  On top of that, he had added Joe Lynn Turner on vocals, an excellent choice for this material.    I wore the tape out and bought it as soon as I had a CD player.  To this day, I still listen to it frequently.  Odyssey is one of Yngwie's most focused albums, has his hands-down best production values, and ends up as my second favorite Malmsteen work, after the Seventh Sign.    I can't think of any of my fellow melodic/ hair/ neo-classical/ glam rock fans who weren't impressed by Odyssey.  It's safe to say that there are no bad songs on the album, and several of Yngwie's best ever songs are on here.  \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"Heaven Tonight\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Now Is the Time\\" and \\"Riot In the Dungeons\\" are my favorites, but they are all good.    This is probably the best starting point for an Yngwie collection.  It also goes without saying that if you like stunning guitar work, Yngwie is one of the best.    Highest possible recommendation.
B002ZG983M|2.0|A silly and ultra-violent film that is totally pointless and insane. And kinda-sorta good fun to watch. Best thing about it is seeing McLovin again, except this time as a stuffed-nose anarchist. Nicholas Cage was pretty good, even if he was acting like a robot. The appearance of bottled rage, perhaps? The mafia boss was not really that dangerous-looking, at least not until he shot that kid in cold blood in the middle of the street. Yuck.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour, one of the great rock guitar players of all time, and certainly one of my fave guitarists, gives a fantastic demonstration here of his music and the art of playing rock guitar.  The camerawork is brilliant, with lots of close-ups of his technique (just the way he bends strings, for example, is nothing short of amazing).  I am pleased to say that he hasn't lost his voice either.  Gilmour must play something like fifteen to twenty different guitars in this performance...electric, acoustic, lap steel...Fenders, Gibsons, Gretches (you name it, he plays it!) as well as a fine turn at saxophone (I never knew he played sax before this), though Dick Parry handles most of the sax work here admirably.  There's a good mix of Pink Floyd and solo material here - \\"Echoes\\" was a particular stand-out for me, as well as a few Syd Barrett songs (even a couple from Barrett's solo albums, surprisingly).  An acoustic solo rendition of Barrett's \\"Dark Globe\\" was particularly moving.<br /><br />The band includes Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals and Phil Manzanera on rhythm guitar (though he doesn't get to shine as it's clearly Gilmour's show), and guest appearances abound - David Crosby and Graham Nash, David Bowie singing a nice version of \\"Arnold Layne\\" (I was crossing my fingers that it would be \\"See Emily Play\\" as Bowie covered that song on his 'Pin Ups' album, but no such luck) and a poignant spot by Robert Wyatt on cornet.  Some nice documentary footage is included as well.<br /><br />There are some minor drawbacks...extreme length with some repetition of songs on the second disc that were already played on the first, but overall, this is a superb concert not only for Gilmour and Floyd fans, but fans of exceptional guitar work as well.

B002ZG975Q|4.0|No, Tami Horiuchi missed the movie. One of the best scenes I've seen in a long, long time is the one at the party where Kyle first talks with the girl who will play the Beauty. Both Kyle and the Beauty are hesitant, a bit confused, and unsure of themselves, as almost always happens with young people. It's fun to watch. And the music is just right. Another good scene is when Hunter watches the Beauty leave her apartment, buy a book, and skip down the sidewalk while talking to herself. She enjoys being alive and Hunter enjoys her enjoyment. Benedict XVI said in Barcelona that \\"a work of beauty (and the girl is a work of beauty, made by her parents, with God's guidance) is pure gratuity, it (she) calls us to freedom and draws us away from selfishness.\\" True, adult men in this movie are weak, arrogant, and wrong. Kyle's father, for instance. But isn't this a real problem today? Ms. Horiuchi should see the movie a few more times!

031261246X|5.0|I don't count myself among the fans of written fiction out there, truth be told I'm one of the guys that Mark talks about in his book.  A techie at heart that spends a lot of time learning the ins and outs of computer software, and less time reading books for entertainment.  I do however count myself among the fans of Mark's other work, mainly being SysInternals and Windows Azure.  I have had the privilege to hear him speak on numerous occasions, which is really what sparked my interest in his book.  Given the obvious intelligence of this man, and his inside knowledge that few others in the world have, who better to write a zero-day based thriller?    Well the answer is easy.  Nobody.  This novel is simply, well, breathtaking.  From the moment I started it I could not put it down.  Now I cannot speak to the book from a casual observer's standpoint, because given my job I understood everything in here.  It does get quite technical at times, but I honestly don't know if that is enough to deter someone non-technical from reading it.  It shouldn't be.  Really I look at it as the modern day \\"The DaVinci Code\\" or \\"Patriot Games\\".  You don't have to be a symbologist or CIA agent to understand those books, and I see this in the same class.  While it helps to have an understanding of computer operating systems, it is certainly not a requirement to grasp the enormity of the book's concept.  Halfway through I already had names floating through my head as to who would play the characters in the book.  I'm looking at your, Leo DeCaprio :-)  If this is not a summer blockbuster in 2 years, or worse yet, a front page news story, I will be shocked.    Kudos Mark, this is very well written and I look forward to the SQL.  lol....
B003UESJH4|4.0|This is truly a good movie, a very good movie. There is little unexpected however and I hate to give it 5 stars when it is so predictable. Now sure, predictability is not bad when executed well, and this is. I have no trouble with it winning all the Oscars. But it was just not original enough, and yes it is historic but the writers could have added some ancillary plot elements and still kept the primary historical accuracy.
B004UXUUJE|4.0|FILM RATING:  4 stars<br /><br />The best movie I've seen in 2011 so far is Sarah's Key (2010). This French-English import is one of those little \\"sleeper\\" movies that totally surprises you and blows you away when you see it. Sarah's Key has a very emotional core to it that really looks into the human condition from multiple perspectives. And it searches for the \\"truth\\" within. This is a movie much in the vein of Schindler's List (1993), The Pianist (2002), The Reader (2008), and The English Patient (1996). It's not exactly \\"light\\" fare. But it's also not quite as dark as Schindler's List or The Pianist. I found the weaving of the two main story lines, one past and one present, to be perfect. It's not always easy for a filmmaker to pull together past and present set stories, with actors playing the same character at various ages, but director Gilles Paquet-Brenner found a way to do it brilliantly. And the same can be said for the way he weaves together both French and English languages into the movie. I never felt like I was \\"working\\" to follow the dialogue through reading subtitles. Granted, the movie is only partially subtitled. Parts of it are in English and parts are in French.<br /><br />The story centers around the events of the French round-up of its own Jewish citizens in July 1942. That's right...the French, not the Germans. Of course I'm sure the French were feeling pressure from the Germans during the time. And yet it's hard to overlook the fact that the French were just as guilty of genocide as the Germans and Russians. One can truly understand why there was a \\"World\\" war at this time. Sarah's Key is simply sharing another piece of the puzzle that we've been reluctant to look at until recently because of how ugly the puzzle is. The impact of this ugly mindset at the time spreading from country to country across the globe must have been like a virus, gradually infecting each host and getting them from within. The opening scenes with the capture of Sarah's family and their move to an internment camp at Auschwitz are gripping to say the least. Sarah, played brilliantly by young actress M&eacute;lusine Mayance, makes a choice on how to save her younger brother from the horrors she anticipates will fall upon them. But that choice has consequences, as we soon find out. I don't want to give too much of the story away, since it is much better to let the movie unfold it for you.<br /><br />Kristin Scott Thomas plays a modern journalist, investigating this historic incident, while at the same time unravelling a very personal and ironic connection to it. The film does require that you let go of what could be too \\"coincidental\\" for reality. But remember, this is a fictional movie at the end of the day, inspired by real events. And movies by their very nature, are contrived to some degree. I never found myself getting lost in my mind thinking about how unrealistic some of the story arcs were. Instead, I simply felt emotionally engaged in the suspenseful and thrilling discovery of all of the secrets that Sarah's Key possesses. And I credit all of the talented artists who contributed to making that possible in this film. The writing, editing, cinematography, production design, acting, music and sound are top notch for this small indie film rumored to be made for less than $10 million. Sarah's Key is an amazing accomplishment for so little money, and a reminder to Hollywood that it's not the size of the budget of a movie that really matters for its quality. To me its the assembly and collaboration of many talented people unified to tell a great story.<br /><br />There are two scenes that really stand out for me in the film. The first being the opening with Sarah and her brother tickling and giggling with each other under the covers in bed. The director is clearly showing us the innocent fun times of childhood. The camera work there and that little slice of \\"happy\\" to start the film with are an incredible contrast to the darker more \\"adult\\" tone of the rest of the film. The second scene that really caught my eye is when Sarah and a fellow young female companion are floating in a murky, muddy river, cleansing themselves. Both of these scenes are just small, idealized, dreamy cinematic sequences that on their own, offer needed artistic moments of escape from the story. Within any horrific context, there's always still something beautiful to be discovered and seen if one looks for it. And director Paquet-Brenner shares that.<br /><br />Music composer Max Richter has created an unbelievably perfect music score for Sarah's Key that not only elevates the film, but is an incredible work to listen to all on its own. The score has mostly a classic sound to it, but Richter also incorporates bits of modern music composition and style as well. It's one of the best film scores I've heard in years. Within the film, the score gives many scenes their emotional gravity, as is typically the case. But something about Richter's music here stands out from the typical score. And you'll know it when you hear it.<br /><br />I could spend a lot more time discussing the themes, ideas and incredible filmmaking prowess present in Sarah's Key, but I firmly believe in letting movies speak for themselves as well. I've given you a little to chew on and hopefully inspire you to see this film, even though on the surface (or by its book cover), Sarah's Key looks like a \\"heavy\\" film. I challenge you to watch it and grab on to it in some manner. It's movies like this that really give cinema its name. And I'm glad to see that we are still making these films, especially within the broader worldwide cinematic context we are now within.<br /><br />At the end of Sarah's Key, my eyes were red from the tears that flowed throughout the film. And my mind was speechless as I just embraced the very strong emotional connection I felt with the story and the film. I'm personally always looking for movies that can give me that kind of experience. Don't get me wrong, I love the epic, action-filled extravaganzas like Inception (2010) and Saving Private Ryan (1998) as well.

B00079FUI6|5.0|I gave this product a perfect score.  Now, it is not the best entertainment ever made; my rating is for execution.  For people wanting a general broadcast comedy and soap opera for these times, this series is perfectly made.  It is at times funny, sexy, and daring.  The actresses run from beautiful to gorgeous, which helps when the dialogue slows to a crawl.  If you've never seen the series, then the first year is a good starting point.  The show has changed little so watching the first year will tell you if you wish to purchase further years.
B000Q79HS8|1.0|Hollywood is known for taking a book and completely screwing up the plot, and this movie continues that tradition. Within the first 10 minutes the plot hole upon which the rest of the movie is based is revealed: Jason Bourne supposedly leaves his fingerprint at the scene of an assassination. Wow!    In the first movie Conklin tells Bourne that he is a \\"30 million dollar weapon.\\" So, Jason Bourne is a highly trained assassin who comes out of hiding to assassinate two people, but conveniently leaves behind a pristine fingerprint; and no one in the briefing room at the FBI could realize how incredulous this seemed? I mean the first thing an assassin learns in Assassination 101 is wear gloves. Again, wow.

The on board flash was actually not bad. however it's very limited and can be very harsh. This little unit helped a lot with that by being able to tilt the flash head to bounce the light. It also extends the light to make it somewhat useful in macro shots as it gets past the problem of lens shadow. I'm sure it would not compare well with a pro model with all it's settings, but for the amateur, even a serious one. this would be great. Light weight,easy to use, small in size (no trouble finding a spot for it in my camera case), comes with it's own soft case.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite series' ever.  If you've read the previous books, you can expect more of the same here, if you haven't read the previous books, then what the heck are you doing? Go read them. Now.  In this book, things are finally explained, but gradually, so that before we know it, we are at the end of the book. I cannot recommend this series strongly enough! And thank god Barrons never got all mushy and soft like so many bad boys in romance novels, he likes being kinda bad, and I'm happy K.M.M. let him stay that way. Yum!

1439181780|5.0|What a beautiful book. I am so grateful to Rhonda Byrne for making these books. This book lifts my day no matter what. I loved the Secret movie and book. I think she has refined her message in this book, so much that it is 100% worth reading, even if you have read the Secret. Their are a lot more insights and helpful stories to help you manifest faith, gratitude and love in your life. I am Christian and I have always believed in GOD's ability to help us with miracles. There is a certain way about her message that seems to resonate with everything I have learned in my past about faith and keep in the front of my mind so I have access to it. I cannot say enough about how this book has brought good in my life. I also cannot thank Rhonda enough for her books and movie. The audio book version of this is great as well.

0307454541|4.0|The full-on hacker/technological jargon and tangled financial webs can be too much, especially if you are lost when it comes to these dynamics.  The author, if he was seeking to impress in this way, achieves that with his impressive knowledge base.  The detail of this aspect of the story is extraordinary.  It is nonetheless at the expense of in-depth realization of the fundamentals--the characters mainly.  His story is overcomplicated to put it mildly...At the same time, in line with the parlance of the times.  The violent suspense interweaved with technology is realistic, which must be what reaches the reader throughout this series.  Also, the violence borders on excessive; and yet I'm sure this too sells the books--not necessarily to me, but to many.  It served as further reminder: men who hate women...are scary.<br /><br />Before reading, you could also go ahead and settle with yourself that Larsson was a journalist, and is not intending (seemingly) to write literature.  His genre is criminal suspense, and he achieves all that the genre entails--better than most.  Anyone who does know about the technical jargon would see this series as even more page-turning because of it.<br /><br />For my part, I will keep this groundbreaking book in my collection and won't read the other two.  Reading through lines and lines of techno tedium is not my thing, but at the same time, I want to know what happens to Lisbeth, Mikhail and Harriet because of intrigue.  I repeat that is because of intrigue alone, and not because of any special connection to the characters.  They, as characters, are not as real in the book as the world they inhabit.  But that I'm interested in the turn of events...there's the author's success showing through again.  He earns all his accolades, posthumous they may be.<br /><br />I will continue with the remaining two movies, all the while nodding to Stieg Larsson as the one making possible the film crew's efforts.  I watched the first and was pleased with its adherence to the book minus one or two parts which were improved.  I'm also glad that Michael Nyqvist plays Mikael, and the actress Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is also stellar.  Good casting.  Nyqvist has never failed to impress me.

That's one of several other reasons to keep up with these stories on film.<br /><br />Concluding: The character I empathized with most is Lisbeth Salander, a researcher and hacker.  The puzzle pieces of her character come together better than any other character by far.  That fact validates the possibility that Stieg Larsson is Lisbeth.  She is very down throughout this book, and I cheer her on in finding what she is looking for: a person who disappeared when she was a child.  Because of her experience, she makes great effort to camouflage that girl/herself as one hardly recognizable.  She's true to her experience because she lost that little girl, and has little knowledge of who she was or became.<br /><br />Mickael is also a favorite character because he reaches out to people, and he has the ability to trust as foil to Lisbeth's inability.  The person in the story epitomizing the word survivor is Harriet Vanger, and that is said whether she lived or died.  She's also a favorite.  The murderers/rapists in the story...ugh! No comment.  With the main characters, I garnered most information about them from their described appearances--outside characteristics.  The author, unless I missed it, writes about his characters a little superficially--almost like they are also mechanized and as formulaic as the computers they constantly sit at.  I still can't wait to see how Lisbeth evolves throughout the next two parts of this trilogy.  I'm rooting for her all the way.e book minus one or two parts which were improved.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I found this story riveting! I literally could not put it down and finished it within a day.  Historical facts surrounded by a realistic human story.   I loved the way the story alternated between Sarah and Julia.  However as the truth was revealed and the story concluded, it lost it's punch while wrapping up  Julia's life struggles.  Fortunately that part was quickly read and I could reflect back on what I had learned about this unfortunate period in French history.    I would highly recommend the book.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|Frank Herbert formulated Dune by conducting extensive research on ancient legends and determining which elements would best serve as the foundation for his novel.  Indeed, the story of a disinherited prince (as personified by the book's hero Paul Atreides) who takes on a different identity to lead oppressed people against his one time enemies, is a story that has been told since the beginning of human culture.  Another classic element is a secret organization (of which the hero's mother, the Lady Jessica, is an agent) that influences the vast world though its secret hand.<br /><br />Upon this classic foundation Hebert builds a space-faring culture ten thousand years in the future.  A holy war that occurred centuries before the birth of the book's hero resulted in the dictate that no machine should attempt to emulate the human mind--a mandate that essentially outlaws computers.  This technological constraint results in the evolution of special classes of human beings able to assume the burden that would normally fall to electronic computation.  Calculation and strategy fall to the cool mental computations of Mentats.  Guiding the superluminal starships that link the planets of a galactic feudal empire is the essential task of Guild Navigators--whose capabilities are only possible by ingesting the drug \\"spice\\" that allows them to see a bit into the future.<br /><br />The drug spice is seen to be the most valuable commodity in this world.  Its value is considerably enhanced by the fact that it is the mysterious product of a single desert world--the inhospitable Arrakis--a planet peopled by the fierce but oppressed Fremen--who are seen to be the descendents of our Earth's desert Arabs.  Vying for the control of this vital substance is the royal house of hero Paul Atreides and the rival royal house of the evil Harkonen family.  This book is the story of Paul Atreides as he comes to reclaim his mantle of authority and lead the Fremen in a actual jihad against the forces of evil.

0307272702|5.0|I am now all most 51 and have been struggling with my weight for 33 years not that I am fat thanks to our culture of \\"I beat anorexia\\" t shirts no one refers to me as fat but in any case my blood pressure is higher than it used to be and since my hernia surgery, self inflicted with heavy weight training, those 40 pants were snug on some days. Along comes the movie FATHEAD and the author Gary Taubes and he was saying some of the stuff Barry Sears of THE ZONE fame said but in some ways he differed. So I bought the book and read it. The first 140 pages or so are full of a mixture of Taubes unique way of using anthropology to explain diet, hard science and very good arguments the last 5 or so chapters are \\"the meat\\" and very heavily marbled fat meat of the book. He cleared a lot of things for me and having lost 7 or so pounds of the 40 I wish to lose we'll see if he is right. In any case you'll enjoy the read and you may end up buying his magnus opus GOOD CALORIES BAD CALORIES.

0143118706|2.0|As a happily married woman, I was curious about Elizabeth's opinions on marriage - from the opposite perspective.  I enjoy getting out of my box and seeing the world through other peoples' eyes.  I enjoyed reading about her travels, the \\"deportation\\", and even a few of her research points on marriage.  But 2/3rds through this book, I was done... and had to force myself to get through the rest in small snippets.  All the \\"Marriage is HORRIBLE!!\\",  \\"Marriage oppresses women!\\",  \\"Marriage kills the human spirit!\\" comments and droning stories (supposedly proving her long-winded point) were very similar to her sister's quote - \\"You make marriage sound like a colonoscopy.\\"  In turn, I say reading this book was like a colonoscopy.  You might look forward to the final test results, peacefully knowing you've done some quality maintenance for yourself, but overall, you wish you could have lived your life without it.      Sorry.  I'm happily married.  Find it freeing, loving, and fulfilling.  Liz, glad your results turned out good, but I could have done without the negative, sincerely drawn-out book that eventually preached at me for being so happy with the idea of marriage myself.
B00005JO20|4.0|The Movie Very Dramatic and was so scary that it almost seemed like a Horror. Lot's of Thrilling and Adventurous scenes with Dinosaurs, Bugs, and Parasites eating everybody.<br />The Special Effects were very Realistic.<br />This film should have been rated R because of to many Violence and Gore,<br />A 16 or 20 year old could handle but a 9 or 10 year old couldn't.<br />The movie is not only to full of Bloody scenes but it also has Animal Abuse in it. for example: the NY people Torture and abuse King Kong in the film when they find him. and then at the end of the film King Kong Dies with pain.<br />The Woman whom was captured by Kong was always Crying And weeping every time she saw King Kong Die or being tortured. which was to long and to common.<br />when they already captured Kong I was already crying.<br />This film can only be watched once and that's all, because it is so sad that it's like watching a car accident ect ect.<br />Overall, I Loved this film with the special effects and the Beautiful Carnivores Ripping thing apart. and then comes Kong.<br />First Rent it before buying it.
0061537969|5.0|I literally just turned the last page on this book and am sobbing, both from the touching last chapter and the fact that the book is over. I want to keep reading.     A friend handed me the book a few days ago. I write cat books and she know I'm a huge pet lover and she looked surprised when I told her I rarely read \\"pet\\" books or novels. I don't like books where the dog dies and in almost every dog book, the dog dies.     There's no spoiler when I tell you this one is no different. Yes, the dog dies, but the author handles his life--and ending moments--with such finesse and depth... Sigh.     I'm so grateful I didn't have time to get to the library today and grabbed this book in \\"desperation\\" for something to read. Brilliant. A page turner. Moving. I feel like I've been put through the wringer, only in a very good way. As a writer, I wanted to call the author half-way through the novel and say, \\"Dude. You freaking ROCK.\\"     Great book. I'll be recommending it to everyone.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I've heard Selena's other two albums. Her voice has matured into a third. She has songs that not only have appeal for her fans but many adults as well. I love how each song has a distinct variety to it. Love you like a love song reminds you of a perfect couple relationship, Bang, Bang, Bang is a saucy break up song, and Who Says is an encouraging anthem for each and every one of Selena's fans.<br /><br />We own the night, featuring Pixie Lott, is a sweet song telling about the one night where everything goes the way it should.<br /><br />Hit the Lights, is a fun party tune that reminds you to just let go and to make an escape.<br /><br />I love that Selena tried a new step in her music with the fun innuendoed \\"Whiplash\\", co-written by Britney Spears.<br /><br />When the sun goes down is a great hit about having fun and keeping the party on when, well, like the title says: When the sun goes down<br /><br />My Dilemma and Outlaw combine fun areas of meaning with a hint of tribute to the sound of pop 80's music.<br />My Dilemma is the song that most girls can relate: You find a guy, you hate him, but still there's something about him that really attracts you to him.<br />It helps that another artist that I really enjoy, Katy Perry, Co-Wrote the girly and confident driven \\"That's more Like It\\"<br /><br />Outlaw is Selena's way of saying that there's a guy who lets her down by talking to a bunch of different girls. She states that she'll never stop until he's hers. The fact that she points out that she's from Texas isn't so bad either<br />Middle of Nowhere is a song in which Selena describes a guy who just left her, and yet she knows that it will never bother her. She states her confidence to that in this song.<br />I love Dices, Who Says in Spanish. I'm a spanish background like Selena, so it's fun to learn one of my Favorite Selena songs in Spanish.<br /><br />This is a great album!
B00000ING2|5.0|Far and above the most underrated movie ever made.  The brothers took a chance on a eccentric style and all of the actors bought into it.

North and South is definitely not in this category, it's romantic drama at its absolute best.
B00005JJX8|5.0|This is a story about an ex-jewel thief (Cary Grant) blamed for a recent string of jewel robberies. His old friends are after him and so are the police, but he nevertheless manages to collaborate with an insurance man (played by John Williams) long enough to obtain a list of all insured jewelery on the French Riviera. This gives Cary Grant a chance to get ahead of the actual thief and also to meet the beautiful Grace Kelley.<br /><br />You've got to love it; Hitchcock's versatility, the setting and the players, Cary Grant and Grace Kelley at their best.<br /><br />A must for any DVD collection.

It's my go too and I always recommend it.

0783240236|5.0|\\"The Birds\\" helps fill the gaps in the persona of the man called Hitchcock.<br /><br />The story is about boy meets girl and also, about love in a quiet country setting. Everything is peacefully set far away from big city noises. But lo, the local birds seem to be acting strangely. Not the lovebirds that are introduces early into the film, but the domestic birds--all the domestic birds. Before long the birds begin to get aggressive and unleash an entertaining look at the man called \\"Hitchcock\\".<br /><br />The special features include interviews with an older Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren. The young Jessica Tandy is seen in the film as beautiful as ever; Susanne Pleshette, too.<br /><br />The special features also take a good technical look at how all the bird sequences were made; how the gasoline fire in the center of town was done, and more.<br /><br />I enjoy this film more today than I ever did in the sixties. I'm not sure why, except that I look for more stuff, now.<br /><br />Definitely worth viewing as a Hitchcock creation or simply as a film.
0811875040|1.0|My sister and I have both tried to bake both the Hot Milk Cake,three times in total, and the Chocolate Cake, two times. We purchased the correct size pan, purchased all the right ingredients and yet the cakes fall in the middle. I finally was able to use the Chocolate cake by using three pans and then making four layers...it seems to have helped to bake in three pans but why did we have to go to so much trouble and expense. AS far as the hot milk cakes goes, we have never succeeded. We have used thermometers to test the temperature, kept the milk and butter mixture whisked, etc. She obviously has left out an ingredient or a step. So frustrating. The cake tastes delicious but is useless to serve.    I guess she does not really want to share her secrets...I have received the new PDF directions and appreciate that Amazon will be sending a newly edited copy when available but will it really address all the problems in this complicated book? I agree with an earlier reader that two novice bakers need to bake each recipe and let the editor and author know where to correct their instructions.    I have also baked the chocolate chip cookies, very good, needed more salt, banana bread, excellent,and the peanut butter cookies, just average.Cute book, but needs lots of work.

0553801473|1.0|Worse then even the last book and that is saying something. Martin is trying to stretch this series out to make as much money as possible and he is not worried about quality. He delayed the book for so long only because he wanted to cash in on the HBO show. Great show just like the first 3 books but these last two books should be tossed in the trash. I will never buy another Martin book again unless I read the reviews first and they say it is stellar because this is a joke. Shame on you George.
030788743X|3.0|While driving cross-country I listened to the audible version read by Wil Wheaton. First, Wheaton nailed the narration. It helps that the main character seems to match how Wheaton comes across on TWIT. Five stars for the narration!  The book itself is fun and the pace is good.  I read some review that said it was like DaVinci Code with a Cyberpunk theme and I think that is a good description--a fun book but not really great. It's definitely not in the league of Snow Crash or any book by Stephenson, Gibson, etc. Much of the plot movement involves pulling an arbitrary rabbit out of a hat. Wade gets stuck in some way and instead of tying threads together through the story, some random solution is presented. The characters and the world itself are 2D and not described in much detail. For example, the story takes place in a post peak-oil world, but that world is only briefly described. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading the book, but I wouldn't describe it as great.

0307279189|5.0|I have been a runner for several years so this book looked interesting.  It exceeded my expectations!  It both tells a very exciting story and delves into the history, biology and science of running.    The story centers around a race setup between a group of Tarahumara runners (an indigenous people of northern Mexico known for their long-distance running prowess) and a group of ultra-marathon runners from the United States. Along the way we are introduced to a cast of very colorful and interesting characters.    The book delves into the history, biology and science of long-distance running.  It is not afraid to take on the conventional wisdom propagated by major shoe companies since the 1970s and call into question all that we have been taught about it.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|It's a wonderful take on \\"there's no place like home\\" with the most stunning visuals of Paris at its prettiest and Kathy Bates and others at their very best.  The kind of film you can show granny and the kids for a wonderful night of entertainment.

0767818040|2.0|I'm a fan of many of De Palma's films. Sure, he borrows from Hitch, Argento, Antonioni and others, but how many true originals are there out there? His films are enjoyable entertainment (Sisters, Blow-Out, Carrie, Scarface and others are great movies, some are classics.) I had high hopes for Body Double with its good cast. But DAMN, what a mess! Starts & ends like it's a silly parody (even some in the middle with the porn industry stuff), but the totally contrived story line seems to take itself seriously, complete with crazy coincidences, totally unlikely scenarios, the silliest spinning musical make-out scene ever (you were kidding there, right Brian?), a rubber-faced driller-killer worthy of a Z-horror flick and that burial scene at the end (how did the bad guy get there thru the gate & how unlikely was he to remain hidden there in his lantern light for the time needed to carry out his nefarious deeds)--one of the most embarrassing scenes ever. Sorry, despite generating some suspense & some laughs, overall this is one of De Palma's biggest stinkers.
0071762345|5.0|Dave Kerpen tackles Facebook for businesses and nonprofits in a very thorough and action-focused way in this book. He touches upon other social channels like Twitter and LinkedIn, and many of the lessons about engaging effectively on Facebook work for other social channels, but the focus here is on Facebook. Kerpen, who runs the Social Media Marketing agency Likeable Media, does a great job of teaching users (especially beginner and intermediate audiences) the best ways to utilize Facebook effectively to engage your customers (and potential customers). He explains clearly the \\"How\\" of his ideas and also gives lots of very vivid examples of what other organizations have done on Facebook effectively to put these ideas into action. In addition, at the end of each chapter, Kerpen gives the reader a few \\"Action Items\\" to think about how to implement each of the ideas in their own organization.    The book also includes a lot of small tidbits that I hadn't been aware of in the past, but can be very useful in the future. For example, although the ubiquity of Facebook is well-known, I had never heard the stat that 1/4 of all pageviews on the internet in Nov. 2010 were on Facebook.com. Also, the book mentions that - in designing Facebook Ads - the Interests that are available are there because at least 100 Facebook users list that interest on their profile. Even advanced users of Facebook might find some of these info nuggets helpful in their Facebook tactics or their ability to sell their Facebook ideas internally at their organization.    For me, this is the best nuts and bolts \\"how-to\\" book about using Facebook Pages and Ads effectively to find, communicate with, and build relationships with customers. I recommend this for anyone who is tasked with managing Facebook for their organization ... and organizations who haven't yet embraced Facebook or other social media channels.\\"

B0058A119G|3.0|The latest Barbra Streisand collection has several things working against it.  To begin with, the selection of the Marilyn & Alan Bergman catalog for an album at this late date is wrong-headed in the extreme.  Streisand has already recorded many of (and the best of) their songs and what's left is generally second rate.  Maybe that's why there are only 10 cuts to this recording.  Strike Two.  In addition, she chooses to have the songs arranged to within an inch of their lives with the typically lugubrious approach that's marred many of her recent recordings.  What's most shocking is that her voice has never sounded so unappealing.  Strained, hoarse and thick, it's obvious that time has withered her instrument to an extent that's to be expected (she's almost 70) but nevertheless disappoints.  She made these constraints work for her on 2009's \\"Love is the Answer\\" but here she strains and rasps her way through the trills she used to glide over.  No one says singers need hang it up when time diminishes their voice (think Rosemary Clooney) but whereas Clooney used her interpretive powers to adapt to later vocal imperfections, Streisand attempts to throttle her way through vocal gymnastics she can no longer pull off.  Her phrasing and musicality remain intact and it's still thrilling to hear her interpretive ability take hold of a song, especially in her hushed take on \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\".  Still, it's time for Streisand to adapt to the point in life where she finds herself because the belt of old is not what it once was.  Here's hoping that what matters most is that she continues to record but finds a better way to make it work...for her and for us.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Modern science fiction films tend to be big, brassy, noisy affairs, filled with bug-eyed aliens, intergalactic battle scenes, and sense-assaulting special effects. But \\"Never Let Me Go,\\" based on a 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is here to remind us of just how profound and thought-provoking the genre can be when played in a minor key.<br /><br />Like \\"Brave New World,\\" \\"1984,\\" \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" and countless others before it, \\"Never Let Me Go\\" offers a dystopic vision of a \\"futuristic\\" world that has profound implications for our present day. However, Ishiguro, rather than setting his story in the future, chose to place it in an alternate-universe version of the late 20th Century, when the life expectancy is now over a hundred, thanks, in no small measure, to the fact that society has found the means to \\"cultivate\\" clones for the sole purpose of harvesting their organs once they hit their early 20s. That means that none of these folk will live to see their 30th birthday.<br /><br />This haunting and heartbreaking tale centers on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, three youngsters growing up in what first appears to be just another typical boarding school nestled in the British countryside. But soon sinister implications begin to emerge as we, along with the children, discover the truth about them and the purpose they will serve in life. The movie then jumps ahead to various points in the future as the three of them begin to fulfill their pre-ordained duty as \\"donors.\\"<br /><br />On the surface, the film is an obvious indictment of the evils of eugenics, portraying a society so in dread of its own mortality that it is willing to forsake any semblance of personal morality or ethics to ensure its own longevity and health. The aging headmistress (played by the always wonderful Charlotte Rampling) even makes the case that, no matter how sympathetic the general populace might be towards the plight of these \\"donors,\\" people would never opt to return to a world filled with cancer and other deadly diseases. There's a wonderful scene in which guilt-ridden delivery men avert their eyes from the very children they know will one die day that they might live. But beyond the eugenics aspects, the film also functions as an allegorical illustration of the extent to which the privileged classes in general will go in exploiting the masses to get what they need in order to sustain their own extravagant lifestyles.<br /><br />Yet, it is as a human drama that \\"Never Let Me Go' makes the deepest mark on our hearts. Through a trio of off-the-chart performances, Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley make us care deeply about these three people who seem strangely passive about their fates, yet who still strike out as best they can for a meaningful existence within the strict parameters assigned to them. Despite this dark cloud hanging over their heads, they still find time to fall in love, have sex, become jealous, enjoy their time together, and form lasting bonds of friendship. As Kathy notes near the end, everyone will eventually \\"complete\\" at some point or another (gotta' love those euphemisms we humans use to help salve our consciences when we know we're doing something wrong); these \\"donors\\" just happen to be doing so at an earlier stage than most.<br /><br />Alex Garland's screenplay is thoughtful, lyrical and restrained, and Mark Romaneck follows suit in his direction. As to the performances, there is one particular scene - in which Kathy and Tommy slowly realize that the slim hope they had for a postponement of their fate has been a cruel delusion - that should be shown to every student of acting who is serious about the profession. The complexity of thought and depth of emotion that Mulligan and Garfield are able to convey through sheer facial expressions alone is truly a wonder to behold. But then again, all who were involved in the making of this film can be immensely proud of their work here.<br /><br />I would also like to congratulate the original author for not doing what most writers of dystopic literature seemingly feel compelled to do, which is to turn it into another one of those damn chase stories where the characters spend most of their time trying to outrun the sinister forces out to get them (my biggest beef, in fact, with the good but overrated \\"Children of Men,\\" for instance). For that alone, I am profoundly grateful.<br /><br />Filled with unforgettable performances, \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is, without a doubt, one of the finest films of recent times.rs of dystopic literature seemingly feel compelled to do, which is to turn it into another one of those damn chase stories where the characters spend most of their time trying to outrun the sinister forces out to get them (my biggest beef, in fact, with the good but overrated \\"Children of Men,\\" for instance).

0439023513|2.0|The series was full of powerful women. It was beautiful. Collins did a wonderful job establishing & defining degrees of strong women. It was definitely refreshing vs the cattiness & delicate flower seen too often in novels/tv/film/etc . . .    . . . that's where it ends.    Katniss' character in book 3 falls short of the build up in 1 & 2. It was annoying. She gives in to other people's expressions of happiness, success and solitude. WTF happened???     Her melt down towards submissiveness was too little, too late and tiring. What happened to her resolve? It was there. She understood her place on the chess board.     She should have committed suicide in a way that kept her out of martyrdom but in the confines of her revolutionist ideology, which Collins did not allow to exist.     . . .  I'm so frustrated. I'll pretend this 3rd book didn't happen.

Never had a complaint about them before the days of DVD and Blu-ray, so there really is nothing to complain about now either.<br /><br />Still shaking my head in disbelief over how much I paid, though.  Wow.  I must have been high.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it.

B00322PK2G|3.0|I received this watch from Amazon last week, and just now noticed that another customer stated in a review that this watch is unusually loud. I couldn't agree more: The ticking of the 'second' hand of the watch was noticeable enough to generate comments about its loudness from people sitting near me at a meeting. The plastic band of the watch also has a very strong odor (for a watch!), but maybe this goes away in time. I suppose that depending on who you are, these things may or may not bother you. The watch is great in every other respect - the plastic band is very flexible and comfortable, the numbers and hands of the watch are easy to see, and the sheen of the plastic band is attractive - just beware that it has some properties that you might not enjoy or expect. Unfortunately, for me, they were off-putting enough to return the watch to Amazon.

034552554X|4.0|My knowledge of botany could almost be described as non-existent, so in addition to an intellectually engaging, compelling and beautifully written piece of prose, THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS gave me a lesson in the use of flowers for expressing the unspoken.  Never again will I select flowers for a friend's birthday, anniversary or passing without thinking about what I'd like to say and the significance of what each particular flower means.<br /><br />Victoria Jones, the protagonist, is a child caught up in the tangled bureaucracy that is the foster care system. 18 AND OUT is the systems standard. Abandoned as a baby, she is desperate for love and affection but protects herself from possible rejection by assuming \\"I don't like to be touched\\" attitude that keeps those around her at arms length.  Throughout the book food appears as the symbolic replacement for the love she craves.  Often she hordes it while at other times she gorges on it.<br /><br />The floral \\"education\\" Victoria receives from Elizabeth, a foster mother with family problems of her own, serves her well as she uses her knowledge and talent to help others cope with the snags and bumps in their own lives.  Victoria, however, has a secret that is preventing her from abandoning her dysfunctional lifestyle and accepting love and the responsibility that goes with it.<br /><br />Victoria's story is compelling and has an almost Dickensian quality to it.  Like Oliver Twist, she wants more but does not know how to let go of her feelings of unworthiness and gracefully accept what is being offered to her.  VANESSA DIFFENBAUGH has taken us on an unforgettable journey that is an exploration of the innumerable and varied aspects of love and one woman's efforts to find her place in the world.  Through Victoria she shows us that with love and nurturing, it's not only flowers that can grow into something beautiful.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of mobile and handheld gaming, but this game is one that I will seriously stop whatever I am doing, and sit down and play as if I were on a console or computer. It's that amazing. Great design, long lasting campaign. It never gets old. Not to mention that the animation is amazing, especially for a phone. The story line is awesome, and the short line humor from the opposing zombie force is plenty to keep you entertained. I would definitely suggest this game to everyone. Pop cap is an excellent producer and they deserve every cent from the purchased games.
B0058A11AK|5.0|I am an uber-fan!  I don't say Barbra can do no wrong, but what she does, she does so much better than most anyone else out there, yesterday and today.  This new compilation of songs by the Bergman's, ten of which Barbra has never sung before, is worth the price if for just hearing her sing \\"Funny Face\\" and \\"Nice 'n' Easy.\\"  The quality of her voice has changed over the years, yes, but that's expected.  It's just that at just shy of age 70, she continues to turn out a product that puts most everyone else to shame.  And what a kick to go online for Tuesday's release and find I could download the album for only $3.99!!  Such a deal!!  I had had an e-mail from the Barbra Streisand website a while back, telling me that, if I ordered the album, I could then download two cuts from the album, pre-release, \\"Windmills of Your Mind\\" and \\"That Face.\\"  I got to thinking that maybe someone else had already done just that and perhaps had then made them available on YouTube.  Sure enough...there they were...so, a few weeks before the actual release date, I was able to enjoy these two songs from her new album, giving me an early indication of just what enjoyment I was in for when I acquired the entire album.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|This book was the WORST book I have ever read. It was a contrived mix of all the kidnapping and imprisonment stories of the last 20 years. It covered Jaycee Duggard, Fritzl, and Elizabeth Smart. Don't bother wasting your time.
0061990477|4.0|There are already so many great reviews, so I'll keep it short.  I downloaded this book after it was recommended to me and read it from start to finish!  I love historical fiction!  This also dealt with complex moral dilemmas, and I appreciated how it didn't take them lightly, but showed it was really a struggle, which made it seem all the more real.  I love that the story took place on several continents and highlighted what was going on in each area at the time.  It really painted a vivid picture.  Although the book was somewhat sad, it was still a great book to read.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|Cage at his best. Great storyline. Looks great in blue ray.This actress is beautiful. Anyone will enjoy this movie. Good triumphs over evil
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Thank you, Jaycee, for sharing your story. When I first learned that you were found, I thought, \\"How does a person survive something like that?\\" You answered my question tenfold. You shared the reality of your life and experiences with gut-wrenching honesty, and didn't try to create a rosy picture of a situation, that for most, is unimaginable. And yet you expressed the humanness and joy that can occur in even the most awful conditions. You and your daughters are amazing teachers of the resiliency of the human spirit. You didn't just survive; you grew into a strong, beautiful, amazing souls.
B00540G3G6|5.0|I'm super pumped for this release! With the current library of 3D movies as miniscule as it is, this is a welcome addition to the collection. I personally think the price is completely fair and appropriate. I didn't see the 3D release when it came to theatres because I couldn't justify spending $15 a ticket to go see it once, but $35 (currently @ BB) for 3D, Blu Ray, DVD AND digital copy is a different story however!
B00006AUIG|5.0|Why this film didn't blow up at the box office is beyond me.  The list of genuinely creepy horror movies is very small, and \\"Session 9\\" is right up there near the top.  All too often, sex, violence and an overall lack of quality acting and screenwriting equal big numbers at the box office.  \\"Session 9\\" reminds us that horror movies, in the right hands, are quite often some of the greatest films ever made.  Period.  It is very well written, the acting is superb, and the cinematography and direction is some of the best I have ever seen.  Even the score and the sound of this movie are chilling.  Every element that you want in a really good horror movie is here.  The one thing this film does not do is spoon feed the audience.  I will watch this one again.  And again.

B001HN694K|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It's a clever and entertaining re-working of the Alice in Wonderland world, incorporating elements from Lewis Carroll's other works. The actors do a wonderful job, but the real treat is the environment and the costumes. Everything is colorful and there is such attention to detail. It's a real treat to watch, and definitely recommended!

B005HGKW6E|5.0|The guilt or innocence of Mary Surratt is not the point of The Conspirator.  It's hard to imagine she didn't know what was going on in her boarding house and what her own son was up to.  Booth and his associates were constants in her home.  Somebody had to be held accountable and the powers that be in Washington, namely war secretary Edwin Stanton, desired \\"swift justice.\\"  No court would go against Stanton and the might of the war department.  So, Mary Surratt was tried, not by a \\"jury of her peers\\" as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, but by a nine-member military commission.    This thing of ours where we conveniently disregard the Constitution keeps raising its ugly head.  Despite Supreme Court decisions affirming the right to a \\"jury of our peers,\\" clever lawyers keep finding ways to circumvent it when it's useful.  All it takes, it seems, is someone in power who desires a \\"swift, sure and harsh sentence,\\" as in Edwin Stanton's case.  Aren't we obligated to follow the law regardless of emotions or the public clamor that heads must roll?     \\"In times of war, the law falls silent,\\" says Mary Surratt's prosecutor.    \\"It shouldn't,\\" replies Aiken, a Union war hero and Surratt's defense attorney.    I applaud Robert Redford for bringing this story to the screen.
B001B6NSJ2|4.0|In 1979 this album never had a chance. With it's weird title and strange album cover and virtually zero marketing support, the album went straight from the press to the cut out bins. I would never have owned this album if I didn't happen to be in the record store at the time they were playing this over the store stereo. I asked what that was and was literally directed to a cut out bin where a few copies were languishing. I think I paid maybe $3.00 for it.  What a find. My favorite song is Oneness. I love the guitar solo and often replay it. The rest of the album is good too. If you are a Santanna fan you owe it to yourself to get this. It's like finding a lost work that you have never heard from his most creative period. Not a perfect album mind you, and I don't care for all the Hinduism either, but at least an 8 out of 10 and worth having for sure.
B000002N25|5.0|This album is a great debut for one of the most talented, and im my opinion, underrated musicians still working. Bravo MK and keep 'em coming!
1451629184|5.0|Wow, what a book. Thank you Jaycee for writing the book and sharing with the world all the things that happened to you. I really could not understand why you just didn't walk away once you became an adult, but the book made me see all the reasons why you stayed. If any other person is asking the same question just buy her book and you will understand.I am now sharing it with my friends. I am sorry for all that happened to you. Thank God for the two female officers that dug deeper. I hope God blesses you and your family with much peace.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow.      Believable, plausible, imaginative, cool, funny and sweet.  As another review I saw on here stated, 'so good, I'm almost afraid to review it.'    A truly excellent and admirable first novel.    Keep 'em coming, Mr. Cline!
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this watch! I have a date only model that is sixteen years old and still works great.

1466208686|5.0|I acquired Career cup's book (Cracking the coding interview), video and phone interview and I must say all of them were outstanding! It was definitely the best decision I made for pursuing my interests in getting the offers I was looking for. The result: I got Software Engineer offers from Amazon and Google, the two companies I was particularly interested in.   There were some key areas in which I needed more practice and the book allowed me to identify them, helping me focus on the most important concepts that are required in a real technical interview for top companies. The programming exercises were not only interesting, but conceptually relevant for what I required during my total 8 interviews.
B00008QSA5|4.0|I bought this album in 1969 or so, and at first I was very disappointed.  I was used to  listening to pop music, not loose jamming, and this album seemed too unstructured. I was young.  But a few listens later it took hold, and I love it to this day.  But what a strange concept----totally spontaneous music, overdubbed with tightly arranged horns.  Al Kooper added the horns as an \\"afterthought\\", a word that hardly conveys the degree of work he must have put into the arrangements (which are first-rate).  I'm no purist, and I think it something works it works.  This worked, just as Phil Spector's overdubs on the loose \\"Let It Be\\" recordings did not.  But I was a little curious about what the music would have sounded like without the horns, and when this album was re-released a few years ago, in a special 2-CD set containing the songs both with and without the overdubs, I was able to find out.  I don't know if I was surprised or not to discover that the horns added something essential.  Which to me is a little disconcerting.  On this album, as on \\"Let It Be\\", the message seemed to be---authentic and loose  and improvisational are wonderful qualities....but not enough in themselves.  They need a little help to be palatable.    I don't want to act too pious about this, for Super Session is a marvelous and durable album.  All the players are enjoying an on night.  How I wish these sessions had been filmed---that would have been a terrific film, capturing the joy of ensemble just as \\"Let It Be\\" mostly captured the misery of disintegration.    Some albums never wear out their welcomes, and this is one I expect to be enjoying all my life.  You will, too.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|[[ASIN:B003VS0CX8 The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]]    This item is in pristine condition! It plays back beautifully. The film looks so new. There are no problems with it. It looks like the restorers did a perfect job remastering this treasured 70mm movie into a perfect 1080p viewing experience. It is a real transformation of a movie that was in such damage before the restoration started. They did a really great job restoring it to perfection. This film is the perfect Blu-ray to own! No Blu-ray can compare to this one!
B0034G4P80|4.0|I must have waited for what felt like a lifetime for this movie to come out and it was well worth the wait.  I've only seen one movie that Kenneth Branagh directed and that was Frankenstein which I think came out more than 10 years ago. It wasn't great but decent enough.  And I've only seen Chris Hemsworth in one movie, Star Trek for maybe 6 or 7 minutes (I thought he did really well for 7 minutes and for a relative unknown),  Between the two, I thought this should be at least an interesting movie.  But why I was really excited was the fact it was going to be a Marvel Studios made movie, and they tend to be very selective about their directors and main actors.  Really did you think Iron Man was going to be as good as it was when it first came out?  And I thought The Incredible Hulk was pretty good, at least much better than the first version.  I thought Thor was really well done.  Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian background was evident throughout the movie.  It had the right dramatic and subtle touches, all befitting the Norse Gods.  While I thought Chris Hemsworth, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman were sincere and awesome, I thought the skill and subtlety of Tom Hiddleston was amazing.  Unless you read the comic books, which I didn't, in the movie, you see what looks like overt support and respect Loki has for Thor but Tom Hiddleston plays it perfectly by ever so slightly giving you the sense that it's not all as it seems with Loki.  And then there was Idris Elba as Heimdall.  I've never seen him before, but I do look forward to seeing him again in Thor 2 (at least I really hope so).  Heimdall isn't a big part but it's an important one and I really thought Idris Elba played it so well that he made the role even more prominent.  You're wondering why I didn't give Thor 5 stars.  Well, I loved the movie but two things stopped me from giving it five stars.  One, I felt it should have taken a little more to turn Thor from an uncaring, arrogant God to a wiser, morebenevolent God.  I mean it just seemed all too fast and easy, it really should be harder than that.  The second thing was the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster.  I think that should have been developed more as well.  At the end everyone saids that Thor really missed Jane Foster, but while I know there was a connection beginning there, I didn't feel like it was ever strong enough for him to miss her like that.  Other than that, the story was coherent and well written, it was well acted, it moved right along and well directed.   I'm looking forward to Thor 2 and the Avengers.

0060987464|5.0|Marilyn Manson is undoubtedly one of the most controversial rock stars out there. This book offers great insight to one of rock's most misunderstood man. Find out truths you never knew, find out which rumours surrounding him are true and which are not, and as with all biographies, read about how it was like growing up as Marilyn Manson. Great read for fans and non-fans alike. Word of caution though, make sure you have lots of time on your hands- this book is extremely difficult to put down once you pick it up!

Its just enjoyable to watch. My husband enjoyed it to.  I expected Justin's character to have a bigger part, but I was surprised by how much I liked Jason Segal in the movie. I was disappointed because I watched the redband trailer and in the movie some of the more vulgur lines were not in the movie that were in the trailer. Hoping for an unrated DVD release.
0345529057|5.0|Ordered the books because I watched the first series on HBO and got hooked. After finishing the first book, I gotta say that the show did a good job staying faithful to the book. But the book, of course, is more awesome. Martin's writing style is very flowery, but the plot is so detailed and intense, it's hard to put any of the books down.
1931559317|5.0|This book is an absolute must if you want to head outside and look at the stars. Unlike another star atlas I own this one has the constellations drawn in (makes it easier for me to star hop) and the borders of each page tell you which page to turn to if what you're looking for is actually a little bit further away than you thought. The index is also very thorough, which helps you find what you're looking for in a snap! Can't beat it for the price.
0316069353|4.0|Times are tough for Mickey Haller, the lawyer we first met in `The Lincoln Lawyer'.  While crime continues, few clients seem to have money to pay lawyers.  So, in order to make a living, Mickey has moved on to one of the few growth areas in contemporary law: foreclosure defence.  For four or five thousand dollars a case, Mickey can help people stay in their homes for a little longer.  Things seem to be going comparatively smoothly for Mickey, working out of the back of his Lincoln, until his first foreclosure client, Lisa Trammel, is charged with the murder of Mitchell Durant, the banker who held her mortgage.<br /><br />Lisa Trammel has lost her job as a teacher.  Her husband has already left, leaving her with a young son and a massive mortgage. But there's another side to Lisa, and while Mickey is committed to representing her, he doesn't have to like her.  What he does have to do is try to cast enough doubt to achieve a not guilty verdict. This search leads him into dangerous territory where he also discovers that organized crime is part of the mortgage business.<br /><br />The first half of the novel concerns the investigation and the second half the trial.  There are a number of interesting characters and, of course, at least one twist in the tale.  The trial has its own suspense and, while it's clear that the process is about winning rather than truth, Mickey's thinking about the cost, and the future.<br /><br />My first Michael Connelly novel was `The Lincoln Lawyer' and I'm a Mickey Haller fan.  This novel had me turning the pages, keen to find out how the case would end.  While the story held my attention throughout, I have mixed feelings about aspects of it.  I enjoyed the courtroom suspense; I'm interested in Mickey Haller's personal angst about integrity, but less interested in some aspects of his increasingly convoluted personal life.  That said, I'll be looking for the next Haller book because I'm keen to see what will happen next.<br /><br />`In the courtroom there are three things for the lawyer to always consider: the knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithfor the lawyer to always consider: the knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns'    Jennifer Cameron-Smith

0307477479|2.0|Yes, I'm over 60. Yes, I could relate to the characters. But I found the jumping around got in the way of what might have been an interesting narrative. And then there's the PowerPoint section. At that point I asked myself whether Egan was more interested in pushing the envelope than she was in writing a novel. I still don't have an answer to that one. Or maybe I do and I don't want to admit it. Bottom line: \\"What am I doing here?\\" I don't really have an answer to that one either. This book came close to being a total waste of time.
1400049628|4.0|Being a huge fan of zombies in general, I felt I owed it to myself to own this book. I was pleasently suprised with my enjoyment of the read, having finished the book in a single day, all told maybe a five hour read. While I disagree with certain survival techniques, I rather enjoyed the book. It's well worth reading if your a fan of zombies, or just survival in general. If you like this book I'd also suggest picking up World War Z, An Oral History of the Zombie War.[[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] A book I enjoyed much more, and greatly showed Mr. Brooks writing skills in full flow. On a more historical look at zombies I would also suggest the Zombie Handbook from Barrons books.[[ASIN:0764164090 The Zombie Handbook: An Essential Guide to Zombies and, More Importantly, How to Avoid Them]]

B004LWZVZM|1.0|This is one of the most poorly manufactured products I have ever purchased from Amazon.  At two different points in the film, I lost both picture and sound.  Robert Redford should be ashamed to have his fine work (the parts I saw were excellent) displayed so abysmally.
B002LB8U26|5.0|An angle, Seth (Nicolas Cage) on a mission to pick up a soul, is enamored of a woman, Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) he comes across. Even though he is supposed to be invisible, she looked straight at him as a man. From that point on he contemplates maintaining a life with her. Unfortunately they are different species.<br /><br />A chance encounter with a mysteriously sensitive and understanding hospital patient, Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz) opens up the Seth's opportunity by explaining that due to free will Seth can die and be reborn as human if he really wants to.<br /><br />But does Seth want to give up immortality? And at what cost?<br />Maggie does not believe in angles; so how will she react?<br /><br />This film has some excellent photography and the pictures of Tahoe make you want to live there forever.<br /><br />The film was based but no exactly copied form an earlier movie &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987).<br /><br />If you are interested in fallen angels then you can not miss &quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot; (1945)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JKI7 Wings of Desire (Special Edition)]]
B005J7K950|5.0|According to the Digital Bits web site, Kino-Lorber will release on November 15th 2011 \\"Giorgio Moroder Presents Metropolis\\" in a restored original theatrical (90min.)version. When Amazon allows for pre-ordering I will do so \\"ASAP\\".  A wonderful addition to the previously released \\"fully restored/complete\\" edition.  Not even Les Paul knew that She lived with an electric guitar.  Can you say \\"oil can\\"...can do.  Have fun :)

B003MVJG8Q|5.0|Works perfectly. Because I copy large media files (mostly mkv files) between my PC and my external HDD for playing on my Patriot Box Office Media Player very often, the slow speed of USB 2.0 has finally made me purchase this item. And I'm glad I did. Previously I was transferring large files (30GB+) at USB 2.0 speed which has a transfer rate of only about 25-30 MB/s. Now, with USB 3.0, the transfer rate has gone up to 55-60 MB/s (could be higher but limited by my old internal hard drive read speed). That's a great improvement over USB 2.0
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I just bought this app 5 minutes ago and already want to rate it 5 stars. I can't wait to show it off and say &quot;Look what my phone can do.&quot; I'm an artist by trade.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|The item was exactly what I ordered. It was great! It got here on time and when expected, love it!
B004SBQAN8|2.0|For the first hour this movie says nothing and goes nowhere except to a \\"Smallville\\"-esque high school where typical teen angst-ridden drama ensues complete with a soundtrack of popular \\"in\\" music only and reels of product placement. The brief glimpses of action and thought-provoking story are so brief that you'll miss them if the overly-serious teenage romance doesn't put you to sleep. What's weird about this movie is as \\"made for the WB\\" as it feels, it frequently rises above the immature crap, though most of that is due to the performance of Timothy Olyphant, which, unfortunately, is far too underplayed.<br /><br />What this movie has going for it are the last 15 minutes, when FINALLY the heroes bust loose and there's superpowers bursting out everywhere, monsters battling it out, and guns and explosions galore. All the action of the climax, however, is nearly ruined by the stupid high school football field placement, which, of course, is a metaphor for the level of dim-witted teenage maturity this movie never quite breaks free from. (Yes, I just called all teenagers dim-witted. It's sort of a hobby. Sue me.)<br /><br />All-in-all this film had some pretty entertaining moments, but there's so much backwash that I would just as soon spit it out than finish watching it.
0062060554|1.0|I purchased this novel based on the intriguing premise and the glowing blurbs from other authors (I suppose I should know better), however, it did not deliver at all. The writer deserves credit for attempting an ambitious storyline which would be difficult to keep together on believable but she (I believe S.J. Watson is female) was not able to do so.  I don't mind suspending belief or plausability but please don't add plot twists that are too convenient just so the story can actually progress.  Also, too much of the facts of the story were told through conversations between the characters but people don't talk like that - at least not people I communicate with.      If you are looking for a suspenseful, intriguing, well-written novel; look somewhere else.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|\\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" \\"Cloverfield.\\" \\"Quarantine.\\" \\"Paranormal Activity.\\" I just can't stand that mockumentary film style. I have never been sure what filmmakers thought they were achieving by doing this. It looks cheap. It makes you dizzy. It ruins the most action-packed scenes. It never really shows you what you want to see. But \\"Troll Hunter,\\" on the other hand, seemed to succeed in a way those before it have not. The camera feels just a little more directed, which allows you to glimpse just a little bit more of what's going on, and the action that is glimpsed through the bouncing lens is gold! No shot here is wasted. Every bit of troll that creeps or explodes or roars onto the screen is well worth the wait and is superbly done! These trolls look stunningly real!<br /><br />The movie takes a little while to get going and lags too often, but it holds your interest. Like other reviewers have mentioned, its clever integration of classic troll mythology is fresh and unique, and it brings trolls up to the level of vampires, werewolves, zombies, and other popular more-mainstream monsters. The movie is well scripted and edited, very well acted and surprisingly believable, though it's clear that the filmmakers weren't taking the whole thing too seriously, which makes it fun!<br /><br />\\"Troll Hunter\\" is a great thrill ride that's well worth your time! I hear an American re-make is in the works, which we all know will suck, so see this classic before it's raped and butchered to be fed to mainstream adolescent audiences. (Yes, I just subtly called teenagers dumb. It's a hobby. Sue me.)
B000007O9L|5.0|I have seen the Stones live just 3 times, at Altamont in 1969, at Pac Bell Park in San Francisco (2002), and at Petco Park in San Diego (2005).  This is the Stones album I play relentlessly in the car and on my Ipod - it just carries the day on every track.  Each song is a nice take on other more-critically-acclaimed versions.  However, when you sit back and want to let just one CD play through - this album is my favorite because it is more interesting, relaxing and fun.  They really seemed to be enjoying their performance on each of these tracks, and technical excellence is not the goal - simple joy is.  Why analyze to death?
0143113100|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my friend, a cardiologist, because of a chapter discussing OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).  I found the OCD chapter not only fascinating in its right-on description of the disease as I know it from acquaintances who suffer from OCD but informative in the straight forward writing of how the OCD brain processes information.   I have read many, but not all, the chapters in the book and find each one delivers insights into how our brains actually work and how we can, instead of simply accepting what comes, affect real changes in our brains that are beneficial to our well being.  The chapter on pain is an example of this.   Although the information in this book about our brains seems, at times, unbelievable and quite extraordinary, the studies are well documented which elicits a \\"WOW - listen to this\\"  response.     GREAT book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must confess, if I had read a teaser of the book, I might not have read the book itself. I am so glad I just started from scratch! It didn't take long to get into, and soon I became completely captivated. A shockingly brutal story, yet easy to read. You will not regret reading this book! Quickly, before the movie comes out and completely destroys it... because, let's face it, what movie doesn't?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not be happier with this book. I read the book jacket after hearing all the hype and it did not sound remotely interesting to me in the least. then, however, I noticed on my kindle for $5. You can't argue with giving it a shot for that cost - if I had hated it I wasn't out anything so I went ahead and tried it. I was not let down. This book sucks you in; the whole series does! Absolutely amazing if you are on the fence I highly encourage you to give it a try.
B0058A119G|5.0|Sure Barbra's voice has matured a little, however this is not a bad thing at all... This beautiful voice is pure, honest and wrapped in perfect pitch! She captures the essence of song by acting and living in the moment with her amazing interpretation of the lyrics and musical sensibilities. Bravo Barbra!
B00361HV02|4.0|With new drummer Leah Shapiro BRMC are back with a new studio album. The sound of the group is somewhere between \\"Baby 81\\" and \\"Howl\\"; less acoustic and basic blues inspired than \\"Howl\\"; but still with several numbers that might have fitted well into that album.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated the album may well feel a little too longwinded and some of the less interesting tracks probably could well have been omitted, or possibly edited. However, it is remarkable that people seem to disagree about which songs are the weak ones.<br /><br />Personally, I think that the album has plenty of good songs and I won't hesitate to call solid and successful. There are though, no songs challenging my favorite with the group, \\"All You Do is Talk\\" from \\"Baby 81\\", though a couple of songs such as \\"Evol\\" and \\"Bad Blood\\" come close.<br /><br />Among other favorites the melodic acoustic ballad \\"The Toll\\" should be mentioned - a very moving song with nice harmony vocals from Courtney Jane who sounds almost like Emmylou Harris. Acoustic and melodic is also \\"Sweet Feeling\\", a song that grows with each listening.<br /><br />A few tracks sound very T. Tex inspired. This goes for to the heavy \\"Aya\\" - could almost have been an outtake from the \\"Electric Warrior\\". Bolan type boogie can be found on \\"River Styx\\". \\"Long Way Down\\", with piano accompaniment is also melodic and almost Beatles-esque in its sound. The title track could easily have stemmed from the \\"Howl Sessions\\". \\"Shadow's Keeper\\" has a Britpop sound, which might well have been inspired by Oasis.<br /><br />The closing track \\"Half State\\" is probably too long, while the \\"Conscience Killer\\", \\"War Machine\\" and \\"Mama Taught Me Better\\" all belong to a category of numbers I could have done without.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Good souding headset, but buyers beware. This headset broke on my now 4 times. Both ear cups broke, the mic is held together by tape, and now the sound isnt working. I treat all my products with care, this is just under normal use.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|The exploration of depression and the different ways it impacts all the people in a family is so accurate that it is almost painful.  The characters are all well-drawn.  There's not so much plot as exploration of family dynamics and the emotional lives of all the characters.  I loved it.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I bought Paul on a whim as I like science fiction and liked Hot Fuzz. I was not in the least disappointed. I loved it and have watched it several times now and each time I pick up on a new insight of Paul's character and the quirks and gestures of Seth Rogan that in each viewing makes it even more funny. I noted that the majority of negative reviews are based on religion. \\"You just can't win with these people.\\" If you are religious this movie is not going to change your views. Sometimes you just have to \\"roll the dice\\" and go with it. Enjoy it for what it is. Paul is not real, although I surely wish he was.
B00466HM28|3.0|Excited to get the Akai MPK Mini! It is a nice product for the money paid. The keyboard is excellent. Pads are not so responsive. KORG Nano PAD is far superior when it comes to pad response. I have to beat the MINI's harder to get the pads depressed. AKAI MPK mini loses in this aspect. Knobs do their job.   Downloads section for this product in AKAI's website is a big disappointment. There are no out-of-the box templates for Live or FL Studio or any other sequencer. KORG Nano series is a clear winner in this area.   This is a true plug-n-play device. No driver installation hassles unlike the KORG nano series. Overall, this product is OK for its price. Pads, Knobs and Keys in one product makes it superior.
B0019X3ZZY|2.0|Yes, Salo: the 120 Days of Sodom is indeed as perverted as it is alleged to be, but that does not make it worth watching. There are movies that you watch only because they are controversial and are chock-full of explicit sex. Some of these movies turn out to be better than you expected: A Clockwork Orange, Caligula, Showgirls (am I the only one on the planet who thinks that movie was very good?). Some of them turn out to be pretty much what you expected like Striptease and Gia, both not very good movies but at least the extensive nudity is enjoyable. Other of these films turn out to be complete crap in which not only is there no plot but the nudity and sex (no matter how explicit) actually manages to get boring at some point. These letdown films include Salo and 9 Songs.<br /><br />Salo takes place late in WWII in \\"Nazi-occupied Italy\\". Being an Italian film it is never suggested that Italian Fascists under Mousolini could be guilty of such attrocities but rather implied that it was entirely the foreign Nazi government that had taken over Italy. Whatever, I won't argue. In the movie Italy's president and 4 other extremely high-ranking members of the Nazi government and their small private army abduct a number of teenage boys and girls (all good-looking ones as they are each personally inspected) and take them to a large villa far from civilization. Here they are trained to be sex slaves. Some of the teens are shot trying to escape, and others commit suicide. The teens spend most of their time fully or partially nude; penises and vulvas are not hidden. The Nazis rape the boys and girls repeatedly and sometimes have gay sex with each other. Ok, so far so good. As you are watching this you know it is wrong, but there is a certain sexual fantasy element that can certainly be appealing to the baser parts of one's nature.<br /><br />But this kind of gets boring after a while because the film follows an extremely repetitive structure. The Nazis and soldiers gather all the teens (who are usually nude) into a room where someone plays a piano and an older woman (some kind of madam) tells the slaves a story. The story usually is about a child who enjoys and thrives on being a sex slave as the child is introduced to some newer, sicker, more humiliating form of sex. These stories serve to subdue the slaves, give them some sort of pride in their work, and introduce them to the new form of sexual torture that is to come. So the Nazis take the slaves into other rooms and rape them in new ways. After this maybe someone will be killed or will kill themself, and then we are back in the piano & story room again where they are taught to be raped in yet another even more humiliating way. I don't care how much of a pervert you are; at some point this repetitive structure gets extremely boring. Not to mention the fact that we know extremely little about any of the teenage slaves, and they certainly never act as individuals who have any kind of will of their own. The Nazis are barely more filled out as characters than the teens are.<br /><br />Then we get to the scatological part of the film where the slaves urinate and get urinated on, and they eat feces and literally bathe in crap. 35 years after this film was made this kind of behavior is easily seen on the internet. As filmed in Salo it looks pretty fake. This fakeness makes it not quite as disturbing as it should be. Although this is the most extreme perversion I have ever seen in a movie, it is nothing compared to Brazilian scat porn. This part of the movie is just not very interesting.<br /><br />In the final section of the film the slaves are systematically tortured and murdered. The bloody gore was supposed to be extremely graphic, but now 35 years later it doesn't stand up compared to many horror movies of today. The shock value lessened by time, this part of the movie is also rather uninteresting. Then the movie comes to an abrupt end.<br /><br />Yes I know this movie is supposed to be an allegory for the Nazis taking over Europe, the Catholic Church assisting them, and the European people lacking the strength of will to resist. But allegory or not, Salo has no story and is really really boring. Yes it is sexually perverted. Yes it is shocking. Yes it is violent. Yes it is filled from start to finish with increasingly more explicit sexual behavior. And those who want to see a film like that (myself included) will see it. But they should be warned of how uninteresting the film really is., the Catholic Church assisting them, and the European people lacking the strength of will to resist. But allegory or not, Salo has no story and is really really boring. Yes it is sexually perverted. Yes it is shocking. Yes it is violent. Yes it is filled from start to finish with increasingly more explicit sexual behavior. And those who want to see a film like that (myself included) will see it. But they should be warned of how uninteresting the film really is.

Glad it went in time to return it. I'll be looking for a different one, but USB powered headphone amps aren't in huge numbers. Really liked it until it went bad.
B000083E79|4.0|By far the best of Cher's many hit collections, this single disc \\"Very Best Of\\" takes the bulk of her top tens (even with Sonny) from assorted labels (Warners, Geffen, MCA, Casablanca) and packs the CD to its running limit. As Cher is one of the few performers to have managed a multi-decade run of chart toppers (she's been in the Top Ten every decade since the 60's, lastly in 2002), this is a testament to her longevity. She's also the oldest woman in rock history to top the charts, when \\"Believe\\" did so in 1998.<br /><br />What makes Cher such pop flypaper? It's that she's such a force of personality that she could adapt to changing trends and genres, and still sound like herself. While some may find this facile, when pop is concerned, it is pure gold. It means you can get the hippie vibe of \\"I Got You Babe,\\" the pure camp of \\"Gypsies Tramps and Thieves,\\" the Casablanca Disco of \\"Take Me Home\\" and one of the first of the huge Auto-Tune hits in \\"Believe.\\" Behind it all is Cher's deep, resonating vibrato of a voice, plowing into each song with both her skill and the song's need. Who else could take the sweet-syrup of Diane Warren's ballads and the lit-rock of Bob Dylan and claim them as her own?<br /><br />More than anything else, Cher is a great song stylist. There are 21 songs here, and I can easily think of another half dozen that could have come on board. (My best choices would have \\"Walking In Memphis,\\" the Marc Cohn hit and \\"We All Sleep Alone,\\" or some of the Black Rose or Gregg Allman album tracks.) However, for pure pop history and chutzpah, \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" takes the prize for Cher collections.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I purchased this ebook while in the middle of starting my own, and I'm so very glad I did! Every tip the author shares here SHOULD be common sense, but in today's world of shamelessly-market-yourself-until-you-sell mentality, it's not. He shares very solid approaches on how to market, where to market, why to market, and how NOT to market. Does it work? Well... he sold a million, so I'd guess so! I'll check back in five months and let you know!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|What a brilliant book. Couldn't put it down, lost many hours of sleep but what can you do? I first read Neil Gaiman's collaboration with Terry Pratchett, 'Good Omens' and thought he was a really talented writer; this one is right up there with 'Neverwhere' and 'Anansi Boys'.<br /><br />If you like really complex plots wrapped up in a little realistic magic, this one will not disappoint.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, love it.
030746363X|5.0|The 4-Hour Body chronicles the research and efforts of 4-Hour Workweek author Tim Ferris as he attempts to strengthen his body to superhero-like proportions.  Oh, and tries to make himself into a Superman in bed as well (both in terms of sleeping habits and sexual prowess).    The chapters in this book, which deal with subject matter such as how to burn fat and lose weight while still eating like a pig, or how to bring a woman to mind-blowing climax with just a few simple moves and a couple of hours of practice, are often funny, bizarre and slightly awe-inspiring.  Tim Ferris really just puts it all out in the open in this book, describing everything from the obsessive medical testing he has had performed on himself to his exploits in the sack.  As in 4-Hour Workweek, there is lots in this book to be skeptical of, but many of the ideas may truly have merit.  Even if you didn't like 4-Hour Workweek, or came away from that book with the impression that Tim Ferris is a name-dropping, yarn-spinning lowlife, this book (which superior to 4HWW) is worth a look.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Terrence Malick's fifth feature is a mystifying and contemplative cinematic experience with a focus on the nature of good and evil, grace versus nature, god and his absence, love, grief, innocence, reconciliation and human existence all observed at times at a cosmic scale but mostly with intimate detail. Though far from containing a conventional narrative, the story within the enigmatic pondering of \\"The Tree of Life\\" revolves around Jack O'Brien, first seen as a wary middle aged man in modern times. He awakes one morning after he apparently dreams of his parents on the anniversary of the death of his brother who he loved deeply; a death that still troubles him. As he goes about his day working his corporate job the death of his sibling weighs heavily on him. Jack then begins, as he has probably done countless times before, to search for answers to that overburdening question `Why? Why do we die and what is the purpose of life'. Questions asked in hopes to better understand his loss and reconcile his grief.    The search for the answer, which inevitably questions god's existence, starts where one tends to look for something, the beginning. We are quickly transported to the very first moments of the creation of the universe and travel forward through time to the formation of earth, the dawn of living organisms at a microscopic level and eventually complex life forms. Next we get to the real center of the story as we witness the birth and childhood of Jack. This entire story is observed through Jacks memories of living in a small town in Texas during the 50's. I believe it is very important to consider that these scenes are told through his memory and so contain a dreamlike and visceral atmosphere. We are not watching it play out as a narrative would in any other film; instead we get fragments of his childhood, each an individual memory strung together as they flow through Jack's mind. The fact that these are memories also helps in understanding the view of his parents and the way in which they represent the sides of grace and nature to such extremes; as in Malick's \\"Days of Heaven\\" one questions whether they are a true representation of the characters or just how Jack remembers them so many years later.    Jessica Chastain plays `Mother', the way of grace, as a free spirited, caring and nurturing guide who teaches love, forgiveness and the enjoyment of life. The dueling force is nature, played incredibly well by Brad Pitt, as the disciplinarian father figure who runs his family with an iron fist in an attempt to instill toughness and a yearning for achieving greatness through any means. Together they reflect the inner workings of the cosmos and have a profound influence on Jack and at times he struggles to find a balance. As he grows he witnesses the harshness of the world around him, experiencing jealousy, lust, death and is often tempted by evil and sinful thoughts. At the same time however these struggles help him to grow and understand life and he comes to express a deep love and fondness for his family, especially his brother, though his mind still questions many things as it does for us all.    As expected with any Malick film the events in Jack's life are not a direct depiction of reality, and Malick really doesn't care much about their outcomes or how the story unfolds in a literal sense; instead what matters is making the audience experience these events through the inner mind and consciousness of the characters. As with his other work he relies heavily on voice over narration to convey the intimate thoughts of these characters, but this time they seem to be speaking for us and not just for themselves. All of this is constructed within a very visual backdrop with breathtakingly beautiful imagery utilizing lights, shadows, sounds, CGI, nature and settings with such perfection only a true artist like Malick could achieve giving even the most simple images complex meaning.    Together it is all truly poetry in motion andthough it is a term I have used many times before it has never been more fitting. The entire film is unlike any other I have seen, one that will rattle your perspective on the world. Personally, the entire experience challenged me emotionally, mentally and spirituality; I'm not a religious man and I understand the examination of Christian values and Gods part in the story but the spiritualism at play I believe transcended religion or faith and although it looks to god for answers and at times tries to explain his actions, the thematic outcomes are open to so much interpretation that to claim you know the answer would undermine the films intentions. In the end there are no definitive answers; in the bigger picture of things we live but a small moment in time. One of the final scenes depicts what is seen to be `heaven' but not in a literal sense. God does not show his presence, and it isn't located among the clouds. One does not encounter angels and no answers are given to such complex questions like `Why are we here?\\", instead there are only the ones we love as we remember them. Heaven is merely the place within our hearts where we cherish the memories of the past and it is in those memories and through those people we lived them with that we find a meaning and a reason to love and live. It is there where one finds true reconciliation, understanding and peace and by films end that is what Jack and the audience get. It is such a powerful and poignant culmination of everything that comes before it and one cannot help but be moved by it all.    I should mention that Pitt's character genuinely believes that the world is a `survival of the fittest' sort of place, which plays a big part in his personality and how he treats his children. But at the same time he does want love and there is evidence of a level of grace within him, maybe because his father and mother represented the same sort of divide between grace and nature, instilling these sorts of things on him and though he tried to rejected certain aspects and struggled to find a balance like Jack his father's views were too strong and had the big impact on him. Now he is doing the same to his children whom I think at times he understands and possibly regrets but honestly thinks it is for the best. I think it does sort of show just how Pitt's character's parents had a similar effect on him (this struggle between toughness/love; mother vs./ father) which gets passed down throughout the generations, especially at that time in history when we tend to viewed father figures as disconnected and tough workers and mothers as simply caring nurturers.    I do think it is his best performance. There is so much complexity; he isn't just this authoritarian father figure, though on the surface that is what we see. He strongly has a desire to make it in the world and do the best for his family, but the only way he knows how is to be aggressive and when that creates a divide or he doesn't succeed you can see the disappoint and you understand the pain it must bring to him so he becomes a very sympathetic character and Pitt plays him all too well, expressing so much pain and anger in his face and movements. I would love to see him nominated for this role.    Jessica Chastain puts on just as wonderful of a performance playing the mother. This has a lot to be with her just being such a beautiful and elegant individual in real life and so was easily able to embody the character of `grace'. I must also mention Hunter McCracken who is just fantastic as Jack's childhood image. A young actor whose eyes seemed to express years of pain and deep thought, a rare thing.    Overall \\"The Tree of Life\\" will undoubtedly divide the general film going audience. In the showing I attended I saw one couple walk out while at the same time as the final scenes began to play a woman in front of me was in tears. No one will be affected in the same way as others; those with no previous experience with Malick's work might find the whole thing pretentious, difficult to understand and hard to sit through which is very understandable. Those with a bit of patience and an open mind will bear witness to what might possibly be one of the most ambitious, beautiful and best films ever that will stick with you long after you leave the theater and will be discussed and analyzed for years to come.
159514188X|4.0|This was a great book! An easy read, thought provoking and touching. Despite the topic, it doesnt drag you down and isnt overtly sad. It certainly makes you think about who you've had an impact on without even knowing it. I love the narrator. I would definitely recommend this book!

159420229X|1.0|This is my first time writing a review. This book encouraged me to write a review. Although I truly appreciate author's hard work and becoming a champion. The title of this book just does not fit to the contents in the book. Where is art and science of remembering? Where is it? My patience to find any valuable art, science or tips couldn't keep up with endless life stories, feelings and frustration of author. I found not a single thing that is related with improving memory. This book cost me $15 dollar including shipping. I just feel cheated. It seems like the whole book is filled with commercials and not actual product in it. I wish author can publish second book that contains orgainized actual tips or valuable sources that helps improve memories, although I would be really cautious before buy it.
1933952806|5.0|The new D7000 is a truly amazing instrument & breaks new ground in many areas. Yet the camera is more affordable then its bigger brother D300. There is so much technology packed into this camera that even long time Nikon owners will need some detailed guidance on how the camera operates & what is what. This is the book for BOTH the beginner & the advanced user. Unlike many of the other Nikons, this camera does do a few things differently. I have had my D7000 for more than 9 months and as an advanced user have awaited the definitive guide on the camera. This book is it. Forget Nikon's notoriously bad user's manual. If you want to really get the most out of your D7000 then trust me get this book.    The organization and readability of the book is excellent. I especially appreciate the short sidebars and recommendations the author has scattered in every chapter.    WELL DONE!
B0057AOOZ0|4.0|Beyonce did a wonderful job on this album which seems more mature and her vocals are certainly improving. I waited until now to purchase the CD and tried to avoid the negative comments about the songs that were leaked. I usually buy an album when I can vibe to at least half of the songs which she did not fail me on this one. I will admit that I love all of her previous uptempo songs, but many of the ballads on the 4 album were wonderful and well produced. My instant favorites in order are Countdown, End of time, I was here, start over, 1+1, Best thing I never had, and Girls. I care, party, and rather die young are somewhat growing on me.
0143037757|1.0|A very bias, one sighted view of Europe at the postwar period. Some statistics quoted highly unbeleivable from dubious sources. It would seem that Judt wanted to describe the period based on his pre-existing views, identifying Communisam and Stalin as real villians of the time where Nazism, Fascism, Hitler and war time Germany were only a curtain raisers. What a hogwash!
B001USHRCK|5.0|Was a little difficult to assemble. Six and eight year old grandsons got a little frustrated but when it was done they had a lot of fun playing with the Village. It does not come in bags with sections and there are a lot of pieces to sort and the boy are used to the presorted bags. It holds up well (except for the tree) after it is assembled. We have built eight or nine sets and this Is one of the best so far.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Nora Roberts has done it again with this book it has everything you are looking for , suspense , romance, and lots of laughs, NR tells a story that makes you want to ask for more ,and this books has plenty of good information on S & R how much training that goes into the dogs and trainers is amazing I enjoyed it from the first page.
0131177052|3.0|This would have been a wonderful book for me to read... about five years ago.  As it is, I was already familiar with most of the concepts expressed in the book.  That said, the concepts are good to know, and the formalization of steps and concise ways of referring to them are worth something, as well as a few new ideas on how to approach problems.    The book itself has typos and formatting errors throughout, including spots where it appears whole paragraphs are missing.  I wouldn't ever be able to rate this above 4 stars until that is fixed.

B004742Y40|4.0|This film from the 80s is a real time capsule.  A very young Michael Fox plays Scott Howard, a short (duh) but eager high school basketball player.  His team is terrible, but Fox has a secret:  he's a werewolf.  His classmates don't know what to make of him, until his alter ego starts winning basketball games, all the way to the championship game.<br /><br />It's a bit of a tortured premise, and the make-up of the wolf is a bit lacking, but Fox (as usual) is such a winning personality, he brings the film up from mediocrity to fun and entertaining.<br /><br />Recommended for a pleasant diversion.  It's not going to change your life.  You could do better, but also a lot worse.

B004XE0P5E|2.0|I listened to this album for the first time a few days ago, and I could barely make it through to the end.  The musicianship, intimacy and genuine emotions of \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\", have been replaced with bland, constrained, indifferent, affected elevator music.  A few moments here and there started to spark my interest for a moment, then the songs would just kind of fade away.  As I grow older, music with no backbone or heart has become much easier to detect.  It will be hard for me to find time to listen to this album again, as it feels like a waste of time.  Again, this is only my opinion.
1451629184|2.0|Having lived in the community where this tragedy happened, I know personally how Jaycee's abduction forever changed everyone's life there.  No longer were our children allowed to play unattended in the front yard, or go anywhere alone.  What I didn't like about the book was the way in which Jaycee's stepfather Carl was portrayed; given no recognition at all for his immediate reaction and response to the abduction. His description of the car and of Nancy were found to be quite accurate as the car was found in the backyard she was held captive in, and the police sketch of Nancy bore an uncanny resemblance.  Additionally, I believe that Carl deserves a public apology from all involved for being publicly suspected of being involved in the kidnapping.

0321356683|5.0|Joshua Bloch's Effective Java is the definitive work on Core Java Best Practices. I have seen this book referenced in internal coding standards documentation and passages are sometimes cited in code reviews. Effective Java is probably best absorbed by a software developer who is already familiar with and has some experience working in Java. This is not the first book a person should read to learn Java. However, this is a book that every Java programmer should read at some point.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|She didn't have lower her standards (again) to perform nude. There is more nudity from Ms. Hathaway in this otherwise acceptable film than she has ever done. \\"Havoc\\" found her 'getting her raunch on' for the first time (which some called brave, seeing as she was completely inexperienced in real life at that time). Then of course she bared herself in the 'gay interest' movie \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". Now comes \\"Love & Other Drugs,\\" in which she plays out a romance with Jake Gyllenhaal. There are numerous nude scenes, and I was struck by how cavalier Ms. Hathaway plays these scenes. It was almost as if she was truly flaunting it in a way very unbecoming of a serious young actress. I can't recommend this movie unless you are able to see an edited version.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a movie about a man who after failing to sell some medical products ends up splitting with his wife. After struggling to pay the rent he ends up homeless with his son. Despite the circumstances he decides to take an internship at a Wall street investment firm (even though they will only select one of the 30+ interns to work there).     Throughout the movie he struggles to make ends meet, one time losing all his money (seized by the IRS), other times paying parking tickets with the last bit of money he has.     But Chris Gardner never gave up, until he ended up getting selected to work at the firm.     I think the Jaden/Will Smith combination is one of the best things about the movie. This movie is one of, if not the, best movies I have seen in my life.    Every time I feel down and things are tough, I watch this movie and I get the motivation to move forward and face any challenges that life throws at me.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I have read many and enough of the reviews of the BluRay Special Edition to know that I will not buy.    I do not want politically correct, altered versions of what I saw in theaters in the original releases.  I also do not want any connection with what came later in the greatly inferior, PC, sugar coated pre-quels.  If the current generation of SciFi and movie audiences must be fed pablum so as not to offend their delicate sensitivities, then they can have your your \\"Special Editions.\\"  I won't.  Leave the social engineering and political nonsense to our nonsensical politicians.    Mr. Lucas, get over your political leanings.  Your original vision and story and films are far superior to your many revisionist and PC Special Editions.    29 Aug 2011.  George, I just ordered The Matrix, The Godfather Collection, and Lord of the Rings Collection on Blu-Ray.  Guess what:  I did not order Star Wars on Blu-Ray.  I won't until you get over your ego-driven sense of some understanding of your movie-maker \\"prowess\\" and see fit to release the original theatrical versions treated with the same care you have given to your \\"Special Edition\\" abominations.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I heard about this book on a podcast on Boing Boing and there was a geeky interview with Ernest Cline and I began lookin for an early release copy. I sent the copy I got from Alibris to my ex in Michigan.  He loved it. I was jealous. This was the first book I got for my new Kindle and I loooooove the book. I am an 80's child and I was transported to the days when my mom worked for an arcade and had the high score in Galaga.  I am a geek and I think geeky men are hot and this book had me screaming out loud and cheering.  Is the writing perfect? No but he tells a good story and I know his screenplay has been optioned so maybe people will be happy with the movie. I may make my nieces and nephews read this because they should about how their dad and aunt grew up.  What an awesome book!
B0055FR5PS|3.0|There is a lot of action and special effects in this movie and that is all good.  The plot is super simple, the aliens come from space to invade the Earth, and the military responds to their attack.<br /><br />It is little boring in that nothing much else happens in this movie.  For example, the 'District 9' was interesting because it was an unusual take on alien movies.  The Independence Day had very good special effects and also it was at times funny.  The special effects in this movie are not as refined.<br /><br />** SPOILER BELOW **<br />After the invasion starts a platoon is assigned to rescue civilians from attacked zones and bring them into a Forward Operating Base, however when they finally get there they find that it is all destroyed.  They proceed to find the alien Command Control Center and destroy it saving the Day.<br /><br />If you really like lots of action, you will like this movie.  If you are impartial to it, then I would skip this one.
0143114085|4.0|It seems that Sophie Hannah managed to upset quite a large number of readers. People who read inane garbage that they cant remember a day later, are mad as hell and they cant take it anymore. Well too bad so sad.\\" Little Face\\" is an original and refreshing book. Grant it, it is not an easy read. You actually have to pay attention and use your brain. Sophie Hannah manages to make  her unpleasent characters alive and convincing. Alice, her husband , the detectives and every supporting character, seem alive even if I would never want to meet any of them. So, people, keep reading your Robert Parkers, Patricia Cornwells and others. Even if you skip 100 pages you want miss anything.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I've never read any of Marvel's (or DC's) comics, so I didn't know much about this movie beyond what the previews showed. Personally, I think the previews didn't do the movie justice. The acting, effects, cinematography, and character development were all amazingly done. Most of the cast did a fantastic job of portraying their characters and really making us love, hate, and relate to them. As a stand-alone movie, this was an epic watch for me.    But there were a few problems that are stopping me from giving this the five-star rating I really want to give it.  1) Portman/Jane's \\"romance\\" with Hemsworth/Thor. Much, much to forced and rushed. Beyond Chris Hemsworth body and his \\"where I come from magic and science are the same thing\\" speech, I really didn't see any chemistry or romantic interest between them. Honestly, I think they could have cut it out all together and the movie would have been perfectly fine.  2) Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Odin. Now, as I said, I've never read the comics, so I don't know how spot on he was with Odin, but his acting seemed very wooden. I didn't get the \\"mighty and powerful\\" king who loves either of his sons, much less than he loves one considerably more than the other.  3) Lack of Frost Giants being \\"bad-guys.\\" Supposedly, there was a big war between the Gods/people of Asgard and the Frost Giants, but there really wasn't any reason given, despite how big of an impact that war had. We're repeatedly told how the Frost Giants are \\"monsters\\" and Loki and Thor both want to destroy the entire race. But the Frost Giants, to me, anyway, seem more like the bullied kids fighting back than the evil people they were made out to be. A little bit more of why they were so bad would have been nice.
1451626657|5.0|Hidden underneath the parades and utterances of manipulative politicians there's always a real war with real people that get killed or have their lives and the lives of those who love them altered by the war. Heller in this novel portrayed war as satire. No flag waving just a good look at how war can sometimes become dysfunctional because wars are fought by bureaucracies. And sometimes,especially in this novel, bureauracies develop objectives that are different from the people who commisioned the war.<br /><br />  Catch 22 is a law with perverted logic and is displayed in various parts of the novel:<br />\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"<br /><br />  During World War II, Heller was a member of the Army-Air Corps and flew 60 combat missions in Italy. I would make a guess that had he not flown those missions, he might have written a different novel where the airmen were more heroic - more ra ra. Heller is not the type of writer who churns out clever novels that look like a book by the numbers but sell well because people like the comfort of the same old thing. He said what he had to say and that was pretty much it. He continued writing throughout his life but he never duplicated or exceeded what he did with Catch 22. I would recommend that every young person read Catch 22. It certainly helped to me rethink my previous support of the Vietnam War.<br /><br />R Hemingway [[ASIN:1456560832 Past Twilight]]6560832 Past Twilight]]

This was always my favorite Sherlock Holmes story and the most scary Holmes book I ever read.

0307946711|4.0|\\"One Day\\" by David Nicholls, depicts two post modern adults whose lives exemplify the insubstantiality of a generation that has been weaned on war, the good life, and the ever present group-think that is the price college graduates pay for their liberal educations.  Immersed in a culture of self-gratification and media dominance, Emma Morley's and Dexter Mayhew's futures are diminished by a tendency to drift through life rather than seize the moment and thereby make their lives work.  Whereas the culture extols \\"carpe diem\\" as a worthy goal, Dexter, Emma and their acquaintances have not internalized the values necessary to take charge of their lives.  It can be argued that not possessing the sense of certainty harbored by earlier generations, these young people have succumbed to a sense of impotence in their personal lives, falling into their fates rather than shaping their professional and personal destinies.  They are easily bored, easily diverted and easily disappointed but rarely proactive.<br /><br />Lacking the moral certainty of their parents, Dexter and Emma are products of the \\"existential age\\" of relative values and the pursuit of pleasure.  Thus are they doomed to epiphanies of an unsavory sort: Dexter's that he must acknowledge his substance abuse and professional and personal failures and Emma's that she has discarded a true-blue lover for a womanizer, has had a sordid affair with a loser and has finally married more to assure herself of her normalcy than to strive for emotional depth in marriage.  These are people drifting like \\"candle(s) in the wind,\\" as John Elton described the \\"lost\\" of contemporary society.  They do not know who they are and because of this they are not equipped to achieve lasting happiness.  Perhaps this is because they cannot exert the patience with the prosaic necessary to make their lives work in the long run.  Instead they are dependent upon outside stimulation to keep them going and to divert them from their endless self-absorption and anxiety.<br /><br />The book centers around the seeming fated relationship of Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley, during and following a \\"hook up\\" on their college graduation day.  Subsequently they meet annually in mid-July, their relationship sustained, evolving or devolving, as situations change, from 1988 to 2003.  Dexter is a narcissistic, immature playboy, and Emma, an idealistic, insecure woman whose goal is to \\"change the world through art.\\"  Both are anxious when they meet for a one night stand, and both are uncertain as to where life will take them, Dexter wanting to sleep with lots of women and to avoid sadness of any kind, and Emma seeking to live life and \\"stay true to [her] principles.\\"  Predictably, both are disappointed as their lives proceed, taking them in unintended directions and exposing them to disappointment and defeat.  Yet despite the bumps in their respective journeys, they seek each other out as friends each can depend upon, if only to remind themselves of what they once were and what their goals were then.  In this sense each clings to the other as part of his/her original identity - before the world devalued them in their own eyes.<br /><br />Throughout their long association, Emma holds onto her original infatuation with Dexter, although he seems unaware of how much she cares and is too involved with his own concerns to focus on the possibility of an enduring relationship with Emma.  Instead he takes her for granted, as one would a superfluous uncle for whom one has a shallow affection.  Yet it is to be noted that when Dexter is down, it is Emma he seeks for sustenance.  Meanwhile, she is removed to the background of his life during key moments of emotional torment on his part during which he succumbs to bouts with drugs and drink and sleazy encounters in bars and at parties.  Likewise, she betrays her lover, Ian, for a tumultuous roll in the hay that compromises her in ways she does not appear to understand.  Nevertheless, she istolerant and accepting of Dexter's unsavory experiences and his inane jobs and even his mistreatment of her in the hope that they will someday get back together.  Until the very end, she is the consummate Penelope, always waiting for her wandering Ulysses to return and make her life work - make her a mom, provide a good living and be her soul mate.<br /><br />Nor is she disappointed because true to her vision, Dexter eventually does return to her on her terms, finally acknowledging the validity of their long relationship and willing to accept her conditions of marriage.  All seems fine and worthwhile until a disastrous twist in the plot lays bare the irrationality of life as most of us know it.  It is then that the existential dilemmas hold sway.  What does the bereft lover and father of a young girl do after life has delivered its ultimate kick in the groin?  Suggests Nicholls, he plods on like a character out of Camus - dulled but persisting in a grim, monotonous dance, settling for a limp friendship rather than the kind of relationship sans sadness he originally intended.  No, he settles, like a lost dog searching for mere shelter rather than the give and take, the pulse and throb of a meaningful, growing love.  He settles for the predictable which does make sense in the light of his past relational failures, self-absorption and disappointment.<br /><br />What makes this book somewhat exceptional is the witty dialogue, the absolute humor of various scenes.  One finds himself laughing out loud at what people say, the very genius of some of the dialogue and narration.  Also the internal musings are engaging and intelligent, even if both main characters are revealed to be less than admirable in their lassitude and lack of insight.  They are sincere in their respective ways, if lacking in gumption so that the reader may be sympathetic to their plights.  To me they are products of their environment and the society that has filled them with triviality and reduced their yearnings to pathetic whims.  This is postmodernism and for some of us it's dangerously akin to a terrible science fiction novel where automatons take over the world and sincerity and depth languish in the name of programmed responses.  Both protagonists have looks, intelligence, education, friends, and jobs, but each privately rails against  the notion of what they might have become had they the wherewithal to achieve it.<br /><br />Emma achieves some success as a writer of children's books, and Dexter eventually approaches his goal of becoming an entrepreneur by owning a small shop in a trendy neighborhood.  Yet neither is fulfilled and both have their moments of acute disappointment in themselves, symbolized by Emma's fate on a rainy bike ride to view a house she has resisted seeing, as if the inevitable confinement of marriage is ultimately beyond her emotional capability.  In the final analysis, they both glance off each other like rain thudding onto a biker's helmet, if you know what I mean...<br /><br />Dexter and Emma struggle with the issues of the day, but more importantly they attempt to find their professional and personal niches in a society that espouses freedom and self-gratification to the extent that the mundane realities of life dull one's capacity to envision something remarkable in the moment by moment experience of daily living.  Thus do both Dexter and Emma end up pursuing illusory goals until each must face the reality of authentic living: that human connection and family are what matters, not fame or even professional achievement.  For even when affluent enough to have the \\"breakfast bar\\" at last, both yearn for something more out of life than having babies or lounging naked in the morning light.  Both want more, having been reared to achieve something of merit, like their own parents, but they have lost sight of what it took to be \\"successful\\" in that light, having succumbed, at least partially, to the emptiness surrounding them in terms of the culture's vacuity and the omnipresent threats of a media-driven society where appearances matter more than substance.<br /><br />In the end they surrender to the absurdity of normalcy, wrapping themselves in the conventional cloak of routine and predictability, as do most mature people.  They give in to what is.  This is just one more story of coming of age in the post modern world where believing in anything is harder than than in the past and where defining oneself beyond trivial pursuits is more challenging than it was for our parents.  These are clever, striving young people who are legitimately confused by what appears to be a lack of enduring meaning in the modern world.  They deal with this by holding onto each other for support, but perhaps that is not enough, as Dexter seems to realize in the end when his one claim to meaning beyond himself is his daughter, Jasmine.<br /><br />Although it was not always believable to me that Dexter and Emma would remain together and be happy as a couple, I applauded the union anyway , allowing my \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" to embrace this couple trying to do what was right in an absurd world.  The author's syntax, internal passages, his sense of the human comedy, his ironic observations of people and places - all contributed to a sense on my part of a talented writer of great promise.  I feel he made a tragic mistake in his denoument, but I would argue the book is still a good one because it implies much about the pitfalls of modern life for the young, who harbor idealistic notions they can save the world or be successful in a big way or that marriage or any relationship or diversion can redeem one from disappointment or ennui.  No, life is a Sisyphean experience, as Dexter, Emma and the reader come to realize in spades.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle<br />Colorado Writer<br />Author of \\"Bread of Shame\\"s is postmodernism and for some of us it's dangerously akin to a terrible science fiction novel where automatons take over the world and sincerity and depth languish in the name of programmed responses.

In the end they surrender to the absurdity of normalcy, wrapping themselves in the conventional cloak of routine and predictability, as do most mature people.  They give in to what is.  This is just one more story of coming of age in the post modern world where believing in anything is harder than than in the past and where defining oneself beyond trivial pursuits is more challenging than it was for our parents.  These are clever, striving young people who are legitimately confused by what appears to be a lack of enduring meaning in the modern world.  They deal with this by holding onto each other for support, but perhaps that is not enough, as Dexter seems to realize in the end when his one claim to meaning beyond himself is his daughter, Jasmine.    Although it was not always believable to me that Dexter and Emma would remain together and be happy as a couple, I applauded the union anyway , allowing my \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" to embrace this couple trying to do what was right in an absurd world.  The author's syntax, internal passages, his sense of the human comedy, his ironic observations of people and places - all contributed to a sense on my part of a talented writer of great promise.  I feel he made a tragic mistake in his denoument, but I would argue the book is still a good one because it implies much about the pitfalls of modern life for the young, who harbor idealistic notions they can save the world or be successful in a big way or that marriage or any relationship or diversion can redeem one from disappointment or ennui.  No, life is a Sisyphean experience, as Dexter, Emma and the reader come to realize in spades.    Marjorie Meyerle  Colorado Writer  Author of \\"Bread of Shame\\"
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is one of the most enthralling WWII miniseries I have ever seen. By taking the approach of a miniseries the three independent main characters were given greater depth, as was the representation of war in the Pacific. This miniseries was comprehensive in terms of identifying different stages of combat experience in war, and honourably represents the immense sacrifice that was made by U.S. Marines in WWII. It should never be forgotten that so many Marines gave their lives to protect the freedoms that we all enjoy today. This miniseries is a much-deserved distinction to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and those who survived intensely fought campaigns in the Pacific.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
1935251740|5.0|For a bloke likened to Albert Einstein, Robert Lanza has to work on his writing skills, really, and he's got to define his words and explain what he means by writing loads of pages and stuff, and use metaphors and sh't like that, and maybe write a book the size of a brick, rather than a 200 page leaflet. It's a pity he wasn't more like William Shakespeare, than Albert Einstein.<br /><br />Sarcasm aside, Lanza has solved many contradictions and his biocentrism is a brilliant idea, though it's not really a book, because it feels in manuscript form or something, and so requires the reader to already know a load of quantum theory and Kantian philosophy.<br /><br />Lamza claims that biocentrism is a revolution in our standing in the universe, sort of like the way Copernacus' revolution placed the sun at the centre; well Robert Lanza has achieved a Copernican revolution of the mind; the world is mind dependent rather than the common sense idea of being `out there'.<br /><br />The only trouble is that Lanza can't really explain this stuff about space and time being in mental tuitions. So I suggest you read a fantastic introduction to transcendental idealism (biocentrism) called, The Philosophy of Schopenhauer by the Oxford don, Brian Magee. Magee was a novelist, as well as a philosopher, and he can really explain this stuff. Magee has the skill to explain the weird. You only need to read the chapters called 'the great tradition' and the chapter, 'more arguments for transcendental idealism', to really understand what Robert Lanza is getting at.<br /><br />Here is a taste of transcendental idealism that Lanza seems to have stumbled upon independently from that German powdered wig wearer....<br /><br />Right here goes:  Our perceptions present themselves to us not in a chaotic cascade or a torrential jumble of stuff, but as elements in an interconnected structure which we call `our world' or `the universe'; both are the same thing, as they are structured by the mind. The universe, Lanza is arguing, is a mirror of the architectonics of the animal brain, rather than being `out there' outside our heads. This explains the 'fine tuning' of the universe.  Your brain structures your universe, or if you like, your mind is the universe and the universe is your mind, and so if there were no minds there would be no universe. This means that reality is mind dependent.  The dimensions of this structure are space and time (and causality). Space and time are forms seeing and the universe is conditioned by these forms, in other words, the phenomena we experience cannot exist independently of our apparatus for experiencing them. If we accept this idea then many contradictions in science, like the fine tuning thing and the big bang, just slip away; trust me. It's like having caterax removed from a blind man or something like that. You will see clearly.<br /><br />So time and space, being the constituents of the irreducibly necessary framework of the world of phenomena, remember, must, like the world itself, have their origins in the mental framework of ours, that is, space and time are mental projections or ways of seeing.  This is pure Immanuel Kant by the way and its amazes me that no other review has spotted this genius stroke of Robert Lanza.<br />So physicists have been scratching there heads for so long because of a wrong world view; so this biocentrist shift in our worldview is comparable to Copernicus' discovery that the motions of the planets make sense if we look at them from the point of view of the sun and not the Earth as being the centre.

B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a highly absorbing WWII miniseries with a focus on the European Campaign. The format of a miniseries allows for a deeper experience in terms of giving face and personality to those featured. It is important for all generations to respect the sacrifice that was made by American personnel in WWII, and this miniseries is a commendable depiction. Band of Brothers allows viewers to experience a personal journey of sacrifice, tenacious will to survive under heavy fire, and supporting fellow comrades no matter what the circumstances. This miniseries is a fitting tribute to those who fought so gallantly for the freedom of Europe.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

1846321484|5.0|Mohsin Hamid writes so well that were it not for the propulsive force of his quietly building suspense story, the reader would be tempted to linger over passages of elegantly beautiful prose. THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST is a timely book, yes, but it is far more: the novel underscores the talent of a superlative writer unafraid to place before the public a story that is bound to create a disturbing response at the end of the roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Cleverly written as a monologue from a Pakistani young man named Changez (a name when pronounced delivers major clues to the story!) as he joins an American in a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan. The story reveals a young lad from a family once well to do in Pakistan, but fractured by the political changes suffered by that country, a lad who goes to America to attend Princeton University where he transforms himself into an 'American stance', performs exceedingly well academically, and joins the wealthy American classmates on jaunts where he encounters the beautiful but mysteriously aloof Erica. Changez and Erica become friends and were it not for Erica's recovering from a loss of her previous lover Chris who died of cancer, the two seem to be destined to become lovers. Erica is from a wealthy family who accepts Changez even more readily when upon graduation he is awarded a position with the prestigious firm Underwood Samson. Changez learns the feeling of the American preoccupation with success and wealth while still being committed to his family ties in Pakistan. While Changez is on a business trip to Manila he watches the 9/11 event and he is surprised that he feels a bit happy that haughty America is being brought to her feet.<br /><br />Changez returns home finding his physical appearance now a cause for suspicion in the bruised country that afforded him success. He attempts to stay connected with Erica but Erica has retreated into her fragile state of melancholia and is eventually hospitalized. Changez continues his successful climb up the American dream ladder of success until he meets a gentleman Juan-Bautista in Chile who admonishes him that his devotion to his work for American companies might force him to forget the importance of home and family. Changez is changed and his decision regarding his employment, his lack of knowledge of Erica's whereabouts, and his growing anger at America preemptive attacks on countries near his home - all result in his returning to Pakistan, and the encounter with the American at the cafe. And Hamid leaves us there, afloat on a sea of questions and new information about the people we have been attacking and the result is a pungent experience in re-thinking the global atmosphere.<br /><br />The book is relatively short (184 pages) and since it is written as one extended conversation, it is next to impossible not to read the entire book at one sitting: leaving the story even for a moment would be like leaving a personal encounter - rude. The story is superb, written with facile elegance, and contains views from outside our cloistered world that refreshingly informs us to re-examine our point of view. Highly Recommended on every level.

0062085654|4.0|Emma is the fourth published Jane Austen novel. Emma Woodhouse is the spoiled, rich, younger daughter of the widowed Mr Woodhouse. Her father, Henry, is naïve, self-centred, a borderline hypochondriac and the ultimate pessimist. Emma lives at home with him, looks after him and has no plans to ever marry because of this. She is a strong-willed and snobbish 20-year-old with a rather dull life who fancies herself an excellent matchmaker. Most of her friends and acquaintances indulge her. Only George Knightly, the elder brother of her sister Isabella's husband, John, is critical of her behaviour. He takes her to task for meddling in others' lives. As with all novels of this era, compared with today's offerings, the reader has to be patient and allow the story to build. There's also getting one's head around the language used. It took me a few instances of the word \\"nice\\" to realise that what it meant then (foolish, stupid, senseless) was not what it means today. The garrulous Miss Bates is a source of humour and there is plenty of talking at crossed purposes. This novel seems to point to the importance of status and appearance in Miss Austen's world. Another Austen classic.

0307266303|5.0|I bought this book because I saw mention of it when I was buying my Vibram Five Finger Bikilas online, and am sure glad I did. What a great read, great characters - I enjoyed reading about these amazing runners some of who I'd never heard of before, and of course the Tarahumara Indians. Very interesting to realise why so many people have running injuries and why we all just need to go back to basics.  Thoroughly recommend buying in companion with a pair of Vibram Five Fingers as I did:)  very inspiring and looking forard to getting out there and running like a child again!

B0015AARJI|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, I bought a black controller from \\"Little Time\\", I compared this POS to the original controler that came with the console, the R/L 1/2 buttons are a slightly darker color, the X,O,\\"triangle\\",\\"square\\" are slightly different. I noticed was the L3 & R3 buttons are VERY loud when pressed and the joysticks don't move as smoothly as my genuine Sony controller. The PS button is smaller than the real ones, and the L1 & R1 buttons feel loose. The reset button on the back is missing, it's actually just a hole and you can see inside the controller. The sticker on the back is also way different. The other controller has the same model number as what you buy in the retail stores, but not the new one. It's also missing all the small print, including the FCC and UL logos. The packaging has some differences as well. The model number dosn't match from the packaging to the controler.     I'm really disappointed that people are allowed to sell cheap knock-offs on Amazon and advertise them as being genuine. I certainly won't be ordering anything else like this from Marketplace sellers as I no longer trust them. I've ordered a new controller directly through Amazon, which I doubt they'd send me a fake and I will be demanding a full refund.     I'd recommend the genuine PS3 Dualshock 3 controllers any day, but the knock-offs are horrible and certainly are not worth $40+.

B002VPE1AW|2.0|I sooo trusted James C. after Titanic and longed to escape once again to an even more fantastical world.... I started watching in the middle and had to stop b/c dialogue was mundane, characters sterotypical, and plot too recycled. I recognized so many different film scenes just jumbled together and surmised, oh well, I missed the HUGE setup to establish sympathy for ANYTHING portrayed on screen.  The white plasma jellyfish may have won on that count.  So, I started viewing all over to re-boot my initial excitement and once again I was quite frankly, horrified.  With the exception of Jake being able to walk, run, jump in his avatar, I felt like an alien on this planet due to my reaction to this film.  Everyone raved yet I fell into reverie.  Evolution of critical thinking skills and stimulating concepts are part of the brain (cerebral cortex) that is disappearing. Visual affects, the lizard brain (hippocampus) is what is being massaged for further efflourage. Major doubts I will survive given the mass reaction to this shazaam product. Consequently, Casablanca with it's limited creature colors and modest budget must be one of the worst movies ever made.  sigh...

B0030IIZ56|5.0|Sequels are always risky propositions. While many has been equal or better than its predecessor, many more have been just awful. Thankfully TS2 belongs to the first group and it's not only an excellent sequel, it's one of the best ever. The first TS is a masterpiece and I don't know how but the Pixar wizards match that fate and even supprass it. An impressive movie.<br /><br />TS2 continues the toy's adventures in a more epic scale. Woody is kidnapped by an ambitious toy seller, Al, who wants to sell him to a museum in Japan. While being in Al's apartment, Woody meets Jessi, Bullseye and the Prospector other toys that are part of the collection. From them, Woody learns that he is invaluable property and that without him, the others are sentenced to remain in the darkness forever. Meanwhile, Buzz and other Andy's toys go on a resuce mission to bring his friend back home.<br /><br />Instead of repeating the formula of the first film, the Pixar artists completely reinveted it. They created a new engaging story with themes like abandonment, one's purpose in life and of course friendship. They also enlarged the cast with more likeable characters and threw great action sequences. Of course the humor in this film is impeccable and you'll be laughing a lot at smart jokes. This story is very sophisticated and stands heads and shoulders above many other animated films. A true classic.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />TS2 comes with a pristine transfer to BD. Everything from detail to textures to colors is reproduced incredibly well. A stunning video presentation.<br /><br />Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is truly phenomenal with clear and crisp sound all the time.<br /><br />Bonus Materia¨:<br />New to this release are: \\"Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: International Space Station\\" part II of a NASA oriented educational program. \\"Paths to Pixar: Technical Artists\\" a great featurette that's both fun and informative.

B0030IIYWA|5.0|Computer animation has grown so rapidly in the last years that it's easy to forget which movie was responsible for this boom in the field. Toy Story, much like Snow White before it opened a whole new world of opportunities for animation all around the world. Nowadays, most studios has their own Animation Department that mainly produces computer animated films. Being the forefather computer animated movies makes this movie important but what makes it a true masterpiece is that after all this years and countless of other animated films, Toy Story still holds up pretty well and is still one of the best animated films of all time.<br /><br />Most of you must be familiar with the story so I will write a very short synopsi¨s: Woody, a cowboy doll has been Andy's favorite since forever. He is not only the favorite toy but also the leader of all the toys in Andy's room. Everyone looks up to him and he is both respected and admired. When Andy's birthday comes, his mom gives him a new cool toy: Buzz Lightyear a space ranger who is the greatest toy ever. Buzz does not realize he is a toy but truly believes he is a space ranger. With the new toy in the room, Woody feels neglected and does something that he later regrets. He and Buzz end in a sadistic kid's house named Sid and both will have to trust each other in order to return safely to Andy's room.<br /><br />Toy Story is such a pleasure to watch because it has an accesible interesting story and great characters. Woody and Buzz are excellent characters playing opposites and the rest of the toys are hilarious. John Lasseter & Co. truly created a special film. It amazes me that all the jokes are still funny and the movie does not feel dated at all. This is a true classic.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Toy Story comes to BD looking absolutely flawless. The HD transfer is inmaculate, detail is crisp and contrast is amazing. Colors are well reproduced and you can spot a lot of things that were impossible to see on SD. The HD also brings some limits in the animation and some of it does look dated (for example Scud, Sid's dog) but I think that's part of the charm of the film. A spectacular transfer.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also amazing with no signs of compression or other anomalies; it's also very strong and dynamic.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />New to the BD are some goodies: \\"Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Blast Off\\", a NASA educating program featuring Buzz, Hamm and Rex. \\"Paths to Pixar: Artists\\" an excellent featurette featuring Pixar's animators and how they started at Pixar. Then you have three studio stories that give great insight of how Pixar is with anecdotes and jokes. \\"Buzz takes Manhattan\\" features the Buzz ballon in the Thanksgiving Macy's parade. \\"Black Friday: The Toy Story You Never Saw\\" is an excellent piece where the filmmakers reflect on the original concept and how bad it was. I think we are all glad they scrap that story.<br /><br />After that you hev carry overs from previous releases: an audio commentary, a making of featurette, and many short featurettes that deals with the legacy of the film, the design, the story, the production and more.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|As I was reading a Game of Thrones, I came to suspect that I had stumbled upon something special: complex characters, endless viewpoints, challenging themes, an intricate and engaging story. When I finally made it to that fateful last chapter, there was no longer any doubt. As I had come late to the party, I immediately raced out to buy and read Clash, Storm, and Feast. All of them as good or better than the last (with the possible exception of Feast for Crows). Then came the long dark... waiting and waiting and waiting, eventually even forgetting about a Dance with Dragons. Only then when I had completely forgotten that it was even in the works, I heard the announcement. I marked the release date on my calendar with eager anticipation.<br /><br />I never even saw it coming.<br /><br />This book, while somewhat engaging, is simply put:  too long.  Many before have suspected that Martin has somewhat lost control of the story, and is unsure of where to go.  I am in 100% agreement with this theory.  It really hit me around page 400 when I thought to myself: \\"I'm on page 400 and *nothing has happened*...\\"  It felt like I was playing some sort of never-ending RPG with a lackluster story, wandering around haphazardly with no real purpose or goal.<br /><br />His verbosity even trends towards the redundant.  I can't tell you how many people are disemboweled in this book....wait sure I can!  I did a search for \\"entrail\\" in my kindle, which resulted in 13 entries.<br />- \\"entrails from their bellies...\\"  page 12 (location 328)<br />- \\"entrails coiled through a bush\\"  page 67 (location 1540)<br />- \\"entrails dangling out\\"  page 125  (location 2826)<br />- \\"beneath his mail to get at his entrails\\"  page 256  (location 5723)<br />- \\"open your belly, pull your entrails out, and make you eat...\\"  page 261 (location 5851)<br />- \\"its said they hung their entrail in the branches...\\"  page 385  (location 8594)<br />- \\"strung those entrails through the tree\\"  page 385 (location 8599)<br />- \\"he would pull out your entrails and make you eat them.\\"  page 614 (location 13643)<br />- \\"a fistful of slimy black entrails\\"  page 676 (location 15024)<br />- \\"begin rooting out her entrails\\"  page 696  (location 15482)<br />- \\"I want to pull his entrails out..\\"  page 740 (location 16480)<br />- \\"her lower leg with entrails and maggots.\\"  page 856  (location 19009)<br />- \\"as the pit fighter's entrails came sliding out\\"  page 886  (location 19698)<br /><br />Aren't there other ways to die? I feel like his creativity is starting to wane.<br /><br />Worse yet, the more I started to think about things, the more they started to bug me. For instance, there is absolutely *nothing* profound about the phrase \\"you know nothing.\\"  Surely it couldn't deserve yet another 13 references right? Wrong. I'll spare you the list, but feel free to do the search for yourself.  Also, common sense tells me that one blast on a horn would warn you of coming danger, and two blasts would signal all clear.  What if you couldn't get the second blast of the horn off because you were being disemboweled by some foe as your entrails are bursting from your midsection. Why would you make the warning signal *harder* to pull off? Granted, a minor point, but a valid one.<br /><br />&lt;THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS><br />Another frustration I had with this book came down to playing time for some of the primary characters. 1000 pages of story and some  only have a chapter or two devoted to them. I understand that the book runs in parallel with Feast for Crows, and that some of the characters don't show up until later in the book, but what's really unfortunate is that some of those chapters don't even add much to the story. I'm still not really certain what the point of Arya's chapters were, but I guess one could argue that every good story has some fluff.  Jaime & Brienne get some references, but again, not much in the way of plot.  Bran reaches his destination and that plot point does get interesting, but it ends up  another loose end that we'll have to wait to have tied.<br /><br />All that being said I will admit that there was one major plot point that needed to be addressed in this book, despite how badly we wanted to skip it.  Dany had dragons, but it was unclear exactly how she was going to tame them for battle. Based on Martin's commitment to realistic scenarios (despite the obvious fantasy), it wouldn't have been feasible to have Dany immediately launch an attack flying high above her armies on the back of one of her dragons. Though with 1000 pages to work with, I could imagine an author finding enough wiggle room to get that part of the story in. However, I give Martin credit for not glossing over it.<br /><br />This book does have some saving graces. I found the Jon Snow chapters to be quite engaging, so if you're a Jon Snow fan, you will not be disappointed. I'd also argue that Tyrion Lannister is one of the greatest characters of the series.  I warn you that there is a ton of fluff surrounding him in this book, most of it unnecessary, but he's still the same complex, black-hearted, self-loathing character of his father's creation that he has been for the past 4 novels. While my review was mostly negative, I would also agree with most of other negative reviews that I will continue to read the series. While Dance with Dragons was not everything I hoped it would be, I'm willing to give Martin a mulligan.  Despite the 1000 pages, I admit that I stuck with it to read every single one, so that has to count for something.  Let's hope that he'll get back on track with Winds of Winter, and we can get some resolution to all of these lingering plot points.
0553801473|3.0|[NO SPOILERS]<br /><br />What could possibly go wrong with a book sporting the word \\"Dragons\\" in the title, a cool shield (that looks like the back of a Mexican peso) and the fact that it's authored by George RR Martin?<br /><br />Quite a bit, unfortunately.<br /><br />As has apparently been the case with many readers, finishing A DANCE WITH DRAGONS left me with mixed feelings.<br /><br />On the one hand, we get to see some of our favorite characters and the story start to move forward towards greater things.<br />Considering the long 6 years between books, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Martin still knows how to equip Tyrion with the cleverest quips and leave the reader begging for the next installment in the series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book leading up to the end felt--no, WAS--extremely drawn out. Just when you start thinking to yourself \\"Yes! The plot is finally moving forward!\\" No, Martin takes character A or B and sends them off on a tangent. And even this wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that these tangents were rather boring unless you like reading about cyvasse games and menus of fantasy fare.<br /><br />In addition to main characters chasing rainbows and wasting time, Martin throws in the perspective of several other \\"minor\\" characters. Granted, some of these characters we've met in previous volumes, but do they really deserve the spotlight so late in the game?<br /><br />To sum up my feelings for this book, it's one you'd want to read only once, only so you're fully prepared for what I'm hoping will be a far superior book 6.<br /><br />Finally, as the title of my review states, this book ends with a laugh, but you won't find it within the main body of the text. It's at the very end of the book and, in my opinion, is all the convincing I need that Martin is in serious need of an editor.<br /><br />\\"George R.R. Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally every since.\\"
0446569895|5.0|I got this book from my local library to take on a trip. The laughs began on page 1. The story that Ozzy tells about his colonoscopy experience was priceless. I work for a gastroenterologist and I would love to frame and hang this chapter in my waiting room.  I got strange looks from people in the airport because I was laughing so hard while waiting for my plane. They just had to take one look at the cover of the book to know why I was laughing. The funniest story involves a dog, drugs and Sharon. This book is a must read for anyone who needs a good laugh. I wish Ozzy would turn it into a movie..

B003O86FMW|4.0|There was a lot of build up to the next phase of the hunger games in this book - as it was unfolding - the book ends.  I had to start reading the 3rd book in the series immediately because the ending was so abrupt.  Still an amazing series, but 2 is the weakest in the series.  Just like the first book, there is so much unexpected twist and turns in the plot - what was going to happen next could not have been guessed.
B001R0KH3W|4.0|Love Stevie in London.  My only request is that Mr. Wonder would perform a full version of \\"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\\".

1935670913|3.0|You should know this before you read this book.<br /><br />1. It's for fiction writers. His rules do not apply technically for non-fiction writers. It should be pointed out that it's much easier to sell fiction ebooks on a big scale.<br /><br />2. The tactics are basic. So basic that it might be good for complete newbies, but if you've already got a blog or Twitter you probably get how to do what he's suggesting.<br /><br />3. This is probably my biggest problem with the book. He fully admits, twice, in the book that his success was \\"triggered\\" by some big event that was not part of his marketing plan. Yet declines to talk about what that triggering event was. Without that triggering event, and the enormity of it, (he fully admits this), then he would have never sold a million books, etc... Also, suggesting that you can sell a million books by Tweeting and a few blogs is misleading too.<br /><br />So that makes this book disingenuous to say the least. Please take note. I write non-fiction business/marketing books. I don't write fiction. I've been doing online marketing for over 16-years as well, so the tactics he's describing are things I've known for years. To be clear, you will enjoy this book if you write fiction and don't have any knowledge of basic online marketing tactics.
B004CPJC3A|5.0|It's good that this vintage recording has appeared on the Originals series. It was always pleasing on the ear; the remastering has firmed up the bass.<br /><br />Formats may have come and gone but this recital has never been out of the catalogue. Nevertheless it's true to say that it is more respected than loved. Sometimes Pollini cannot take a trick. He's frequently accused of coldness. His survey of late Beethoven Piano Sonatas won a Gramophone Award in the Seventies ([[ASIN:B000001GXB Beethoven- Die Sp&auml;ten Klaviersonaten (Late Piano Sonatas): Opp. 101, 106, 109, 110, 111]]) but it subsequently underwent 'death-by-asterix' - again, on the basis of his &#34;frigidity&#34;; now this once celebrated cycle struggles to command an entry in the Penguin Guide. But if Pollini were to inject more 'warmth' into his music-making, other accusations would be forthcoming. His best course is to stay true to himself, as well he should.<br /><br />These performances command attention. I underestimated them in the past. This is a jewelled accuracy to Pollini's playing that is attractive. Perhaps he plays it safe interpretatively in both works but he's alive to their operatic currents (the A Major was written concurrently with Figaro). Uncle Karl and the Vienna Philharmonic of the '70s inject grunt, charm and stately drama into the music-making.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Uchida (I) is more unbuttoned than Pollini and thus a tad more preferable ([[ASIN:B0000040YS Mozart: Piano Concerti 22 & 23]]. Serkin in his earlier account offers deeper hues in the F Major ([[ASIN:B0001ENYJY Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 19 & 20]]).<br /><br />In short, this Pollini/Bohm survey of K 459 & K 488 lays strong claim on the collector.trong claim on the collector. Neither performance is definitive but they are none the worse for that.
0553801473|5.0|First off, I want to say to the people that are bashing this book, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? How could a book this good disappoint any reader of reasonable intelligence? Anyone who has taken the time to read (and hopefully enjoy) the first 4 books of this series should have no real gripe with this one. My theory is that many fans were pissed at George for taking so damn long to finish this one & were waiting for an opportunity to let their displeasure with the delay be known. I can defend this opinion by stating that there were idiots posting negative reviews of this book BEFORE IT EVEN CAME OUT! I'm not going to say that I have never been frustrated watching George fly around the world & dedicate so much of his time to side projects instead of the one that he will be remembered for. That is frustrating! That being said, as long as he gets his butt in gear & completes the series in a satisfying way, I am prepared to give the man the benefit of the doubt & wait patiently.<br />  I was not in any way disappointed with A Dance With Dragons. It was a definite improvement over book 4 (which was also better than a lot of reviews would have you believe). I don't want to mention crucial happenings within the book because I despise spoilers and don't want to ruin the experience for anyone thinking of reading this.<br />  Keeping my review short & to the point, George presented great expansions of the story without becoming lost in it. Jon, Daenerys & Tyrion are the star players and are featured prominently. A traitorous character from the earlier books  is brought back into play in a disturbing but entertaining way. A few characters are missing or barely featured & some questions are still left unanswered but that is okay, given the wealth of story built around the included cast. The villains & heroes (sometimes the same character is both, in a nice, complex sort of way) do what they are supposed to do...they entertain, fascinate, thrill & on occasion terrify.<br />The stage is set for what is to come & I am confident that George can end this epic in a very satisfying way. So if you haven't read this yet & are on the fence because of the mixed reviews, take a chance on it & form your own opinion. If you read this and didn't like it for one reason or another, that's ok, we all know what they compare opinions to.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|For people complaining about how \\"bad\\" the teacher's behavior was in the movie and how \\"teachers do not treat students like that\\", this movie is called BAD TEACHER. \\"Bad\\" implies inappropraite behavior. It's meant to be a bit over the top and probably isnt likely to happen in real life. But this is a just a movie, so it's allowed to be exaggerated for comedic affect.    Anyways, having said that, being a huge fan of Cameron Diaz for her quirky characters and cute romantic comedies, i really couldnt wait to watch this movie. I admit that Diaz might not always play characters with much depth, but they are always fun and engaging. In \\"Bad Teacher\\" she plays the Elizabeth, aforementioned bad teacher, she drinks, uses weed, curses, doesnt teach, cheats, yells at her students and hits them with basketballs. But she also displays another side of her that is funny, determined, and isnt scared of a challenge. She's the anti-hero audiences end up rooting for.    Russel's (Jason Segal) plays the persistent gym teacher that provides another comedic element to the story. At first i was afraid that he was gonna be the whipped loser who is charmed by Diaz's character no matter how badly she treats him, but that ends up not being the case. He is not spineless and has a wicked sense of humor. His performance is on par with Diaz's. I have a feeling he's gonna be in the hollywood industry to stay.    Justin Timberlake plays Scott, a new rich substitute teacher. I'm not very sure why he turned to movies, and his character here is a bit one dimensional and slightly unlikeable, but at one instant very,very funny. He plays the role of the rich guy Diaz is trying to bag but we all know is he's not right for her.     Overall, this movie is perfect for an evening in with a bowl of popcorn and a huge can of soda. It's lighthearted, genuinely funny, and has the perfect (albeit a slightly predictable) ending. I just loved it! Even the snobby characters have a side that makes you feel sorry forthem. A great main cast combined an equally quirky supporting cast makes a great movie for the summer!

I don't think that I am going to be able to talk to anyone around me for several days, because I need to quietly contemplate a haiku worthy of Lord Toranaga's ears .  This book has changed my personality, and my entire outlook on life.  I can't even begin to explain to you what the plot of the book is because that would make it seem like just another book.  It is not just another book, it is a masterpiece.  If I was rich I would build a statue of the book and then encase that statue in solid gold.  The only reason I'm not basking in total bliss right now is because it is my duty to convince you to read this book.  I would even consider buying you the book if that would make you read it.
0385732554|3.0|The Giver is about a boy named Jonas.  He gets picked to be the most respected and honorable person in his whole Community.  He soon learns that it will have pain and then he starts to doubt being the most respected and the most honored person in his Community because it will have pain.  The Giver is the person who holds all memories of sadness, pain, love, and sunshine because the other people in the Community can't handle the reality of these feelings.  These people would do anything for him because without The Giver, the people of The Community (yes, that's where they live) would ultimately destroy themselves because they now wouldn't have anybody to take advice from.<br /><br />Apparently, back in the old days of their Community, people chose their own jobs, people were homeless, and people could choose to have an actual child of their own.  I don't understand why they still can't do that now.<br /><br />And finally, the releases.  Who kills somebody to \\"release\\" them.  I don't even know why the elderly would attend their friends' releases!  They get killed!  So do the newborns and it is completely unfair to kill the newborns just because of their weight.  Who does that?!<br /><br />All in all, the story sort of went downhill from the point where the newborn child is \\"released\\".

0670022411|1.0|My book club chose this as their \\"light\\" summer reading.  Although light in content, this novel is overly long for what it is and a pretty hefty volume.  And in spite of its length, the story does not even come to any real conclusion - clearly this author plans on at least one sequel.  I chose to listen to it on cd at the gym and in my car rather than invest the time it would take away from some other activity reading it, and am glad I did.  The reader was very good, so that did not adversely affect my opinion.  This is romantic fluff at best.  I know there is a market for that so if that is what you are looking for I suppose it is fine, although it is poorly written romantic fluff in my opinion, but if you are looking for something a little more substantial, don't waste your time.  There were too many nonsensical characters and events for me to suspend disbelief (obviously important to me), the writing was wooden and formulaic, the plot often disjointed, and the characters were cardboard.  If I had to hear the heroine - or should I say \\"ma coeur\\" - say \\"my husband\\" one more time - really, who refers to their husband that way over and over and over ad nauseam.  Oh, I'm sorry, she's the world's greatest witch.  I guess that's who.  I like a good witch story as much as the next guy - give me the first of the Anne Rice witch novels before their history got too convoluted.  I like a well written romance - give me any of the great Gothic novels - \\"Rebecca\\", \\"Jane Eyre\\", etc.  And I even like a good mythical war - give me \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", or even the children's novel \\"The Other Side of Green Hills\\".  At least the 20 hours I invested listening to this were hours I would have spent doing some other mindless activity while I exercised or drove.  I am glad I DID NOT waste valuable reading time on this.  This is actually the second worst book I have ever \\"read\\" (I know, I didn't read it, so maybe I should say the 2nd worst story I have ever had told to me).  But this one was waaaaaay longer than number 1, which makes it the biggest waste of time!
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I listened to this song at work against my will, but this whole CD really grew on me! All of these songs are so catchy. However, don't expect any lyrics too different from typical Maroon 5- the lyrics are all fairly whiny, some are a bit creepy, etc. But once you listen, you won't be able to get these songs out of your head! I suggest listening to the 1:30 long samples on iTunes to get a feel for them before you buy the CD. I recommend it!
0486227073|1.0|I have had this book for forty years now. I was told as a young artist that this was THE book which would show me the way. I did find the way, my way anyway, but this book had nothing to do with it. In art circles there are certain names which it is taboo to speak critically about. Do not attempt to give this book less than five stars if you are within 50 blocks of the Art Student's League. I cannot tell you how many times I have been told \\"this is the greatest work on anatomy bar none! Likely the greatest work on anything !!!\\" What abject nonsense. I don't get it. I am forty years along now, and I just do not get why this is a good book for anyone's purpose regarding artistic anatomy. It is no more than an intro, and at that a VERY POOR one! It has nothing to do with Brigman's talent or his ingenuity. These seem just some of his notes on the subject anyway. It is no Grand work. One star. That is that! Still and all - maybe it's just me.

0062112430|5.0|Lena lives in a world where love is cured. In those under 18 where 'curing' love often results in complication or death, loving is treated as a crime by the government, and sickens and horrifies the citizens around them. Known as the disease deliria, a reader is really forced to see just how much of our passion for life comes from love or its' associated symptoms. Not just romantic love, but family love, love of others such as pets, is gone as well. The arts, which are so commonly born from either being in love or the lack of it, is equally frowned upon. Lena has grown up in a world without fairy tales or poetry, with even the music they listen to controlled as well. Those who have been 'cured' genuinely believe that they are happier for having had the cure, even if they loved beforehand, and it is horrifying to see just how lifeless their lives become.<br /><br />Delirium however, is really about Lena discovering love and how much it changes a person. Having grown up fearing love, Delirium is wonderfully well written with Lena not just cautious, but genuinely afraid of getting the 'disease' even after she begins to care for Alex. Lena's character, as well as that of her best friend Hana's, and Alex are all so well-rounded and interesting, that it is hard not to love them. While reading delirium there were moments when my heart broke, and moments when I cheered.<br /><br />One thing that is wonderful in Delirium is that it isn't just the 'love interest' that causes the character to change, which has been all too often the only cause in dystopian novels as of late. Before Alex even comes into the picture, Hana is already challenging Lena to take a look at the world around her, and realize that their society isn't perfect. When Alex enters the picture, he does become the driving force for the rest of the novel, but he is never the only thing causing her to change.<br /><br />As the first of three novels, I am definitely eagerly anticipating the next novel. The ending of Delirium made me want MORE MORE, and I just had to know what came next as soon as possible. Having read the special edition of Delirium, I got a sneak peek of book 2, Pandemonium that only confirmed those thoughts.MORE MORE, and I just had to know what came next as soon as possible.

1250004349|3.0|This is one of the few examples where I could see the movie being better than the book.  The author is very good at painting a picture, but the internal dialogue of all the characters reads very hollow.  She has a bad habit of telling you things that she had discussed only half a dozen pages before that make you think she was trying to get to a proper word count.  After the secret of Sarah's Key is discovered and the main character becomes the focus, it just gets bogged down and is a slog.  The problem of internal dialogue and repeating herself just gets ramped up and made me glad that I was done with it.  I'd rather have a good history book on Vichy France like Robert Paxton's classic study.

0385533829|4.0|The mystery is intriguing - the facts on which the fiction is based are fascinating - and the geographical setting is unexpected (D.C. that is). And yet one can't help but wonder if this is a 'formula' based book.  And the formula is: the hero has no ideas what he is getting involved in, then there is a lone bad guy, then there is a heroine - smart enough to keep up with the harvard professor, a deadline (or else we have an armageddon). And then when everything seems to have lost - the mystery unravels itself. But again aren't all mysteries more or less the same? The making of the villain - why he is the way he is - is not satisfying.  Yet Dan Brown pulls it off by good storytelling.     Some of the pictures in the illustrated version are totally unnecessary (Sikorsky's helicopter???). And some are simply not there when you really want to see those.

0439023521|5.0|I'm rereading this book right now, because I love it so much. The Hunger Games is the perfect length for me to feel as though I know the characters and perfect timing for the events to unfold. There is no \\"fluff\\" and no unnecessary descriptions, giving way for your own imagination to take over.     Even though the hunger games are violent, in the book, there was little gore. The way it was written made it so you can understand how these deaths can seem like entertainment to the Capitol--it was all very detatched (with the exception of Rue). The underlying disgust for all things Capitol is everywhere.    I highly recommend this book. It's great for all ages.

B00004VVN9|5.0|I was privileged to see 'Brainstorm' a few times in the theater.  What one forgot about this film in it's initial run, is that it went from regular screen width to 32mm (with a very subtle fish-eye lens effect)during viewing the virtual reality/recorded memory scenes.  This was to emphasize having your senses getting 'better' when using this memory recording device.  Unfortunately, this only works in a theater, and is lost even on a wide screen TV.  Although the acting was a little cerebral, it worked as it gave the film a grittiness to science fiction where camp was common for a film like this in 1984.  That is where the acting becomes astounding.  Louise Fletcher won a People's Choice award for her role in this film.  Yes, Natalie Wood died during the filming and I have heard people say, 'the stand-in for her absence is noticeable', I have yet to see it. I don't see Ms. Wood's tragic death as a stigma on the film but simply, is what it is, separate from the movie.  The special effects are dazzling and I challenge anyone to do better even in this CG age.  This is Academy Award winning composer James Horner's best work as well.  This was my first exposure to Christopher Walken, and I followed his career earnestly.  I cannot leave out the great performances of Cliff Robertson, as the project manager, and Donald Hutton as the science rep from the Department of Defense.<br /><br />The film begins with a breakthrough in research in recording memories (complete with enhancements in all senses) that not only allows one to learn to play the piano and finish the fifth grade in 5 minutes, but remember lost passions for a troubled marriage between the marketing researcher (Wood) and lead scientist (Walken).  But it doesn't take long for the Department of Defense to want to exploit it, much to the ire of the other lead scientist (Fletcher).  During a lone night in her lab, Fletcher's character suffers a fatal heart attack...and records the event on the groundbreaking device!Knowing his fellow scientist would have wanted him to see the recording, Walken's character must hack and trick his way into the area where it is now tightly secured.  With the help of his wife and friends, he succeeds and sees 'memory bubbles'(a nice twist to 'life flashing before your eyes'), 'Cancer Hell (Fletcher's character smoked a lot)', the galaxy, and finally, the white light that beckons to many arriving departed.<br /><br />I wished the DVD had extras, such as deleted scenes and such.  I do know that there are a few other 'crossing over' scenes that didn't make it to the final cut of the movie (I recall vividly reading in a magazine).<br /><br />'Brainstorm' is a forgotten classic that's virtual reality concept may be debated as dated in sci-fi-becoming reality-age concepts of 3D holograms and virtual computers, but we have yet to record memories straight from someone's cerebral perceptions and play them in another's mind.  Let's not forget that the film was made when CG effects were either non-existent or in their experimental stage and doesn't show thanks to the skills of Douglas Trumbul.  'Brainstorm' still is a 27 year old movie that's way ahead of it's time.
B00005221M|5.0|Set during the Colonial period in the United States when the frontier of European colonization still included areas in the 13 original colonies, The Last of the Mohicans is arguably one of the chronologically earliest \\"Westerns\\", taking place a little over 100 years before the usual timeframe of the genre, which generally tends to be around 1865-1885.  At any rate, it is a top-notch action adventure which might actually improve upon it's source material, with which it takes great liberty.    Cora and Alice Munro are flush with the excitement of arriving to join their father, the presiding Colonel at Fort William Henry in upstate New York.  They're also happy to be greeted by their childhood friend Duncan Heyward, a Major in the British army who will be their escort.  Cora's happiness at the reunion is muted, however, with the knowledge that she will no longer be able to put off giving Duncan an answer to a marriage proposal - one which she knows in her gut she's going to have to turn down as she sees him more as a dear brother than husband material.    The impending awkward conversation unfortunately turns out to be the least of Cora's problems, as they have landed smack in the middle of what would later be known as the French and Indian War.  Their detachment attacked, the three are aided by the Mohican Chingacgook, his biological son Uncas, and his adopted son Nathaniel, nicknamed Hawkeye.    The two women begin tentative romances with the two younger Mohicans; but their father's stubbornness, a very bad mistake on Duncan's part prompted by the bad timing of Cora and Nathaniel starting a relationship while his feelings are still raw, and a skeleton in the Colonel's closet involving the Huron guide Magua lead to a series of tragedies...    The movie is highlighted by great performances all around, beautiful scenery provided by locations in North Carolina filling in for upstate New York, and above all the long, Shakespearean final sequence heightened by a marvelousmusical score - marked by noble sacrifice, primal desperation, tragic waste, and a final act of vengeance.  The emotional context of what goes down, slowly built up throughout the movie, makes what would have been a good action sequence a remarkable experience that anyone who likes this genre should embark on at least once.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|This is a wonderful coming of age classic.  It covers the issues of growing into adulthood, leaving your high-school buddies for university or a job, and gaining some respect for your parents.  Well-acted and with lots of charm.  I heartily recommend watching this film and indeed having it in your collection to watch with your children and grandchildren.
B002AGIEYG|3.0|BOTTOM LINE: Nice try. 3.5 stars for me. An interesting set, and I'm glad I picked it up to try, but it won't be one of the \\"go to\\" sets for me. There are too many other sets and indvidual renditions of the 4 symphonies that I believe just get to the heart of the matter better than Rattle (see bottom of review for these if you want to skip my ranting).    I spent considerable time reading the various Amazon reviews before purchasing this set. I also read all your notes back and forth to each other, which are almost as entertaining as listening to the music.     However, many of the reviews are things I agree with, now having listened to the Rattle set 6 times.     --Its beautiful, lush playing. Breathtakingly so. The Berliners can turn on a dime.   --Its also clear Rattle has an interesting, distinctive vision for these works.  --He does avoid the \\"wall of sound\\" approach that several reviewers have commented on, specifially in reference to Karajan.  --The results are imposing Brahms, without question.  --The recording quality is really good.    But (to this layman) Rattle leaves off a few things in his vision:     --The crags and the teeth  --Some Brahmsian roughness,  --Some of the fundamental elements of conflict and drama    These also are what make these particular pieces monumental.     Yes, Rattle's renditions are imposing, the way an enormous, finely polished armoire is imposing. Its completely burnished within an inch of its life. This is the way the Rattle set strikes me. Its so pretty and large I want to store my linen tablecloths in the jewelcase and impress my guests with my good taste.     But Brahms symphonies have crags and some sharp edges, just like mountain ranges. Mountains can be beautiful too, but would you find the Grand Tetons as impressive and breathtaking if the Park Service went and rounded off the sharp points into perfectly shaped dental sets? I doubt it. Rattle's renditions aren't completey benign and conflict free, but they do seem tohave been...well, tamed. I have to laugh when so many of you sneer at HVK for his seemingly over-burnished sound, but then you find THESE acceptable? Sorry. no can-do for me.      Quick individual symphony notes. (remember these come from a layman, so those of you with vast musical training can of course ignore me)    --Rattles approach works best, IMHO, in Symphony #2. Its not a perfect rendition, but I believe its the most succesful in the set, and the lush. over-the-top beauty is best accommodated here.     --I also believe the 4th isn't bad. The cumulative impact of Rattle's approach works best here in the buildup to the finale.     --I am lukewarm about #1. This, on balance, is less because of Rattle, per se, but just because there are so many other good renditions out there. I am not sure Rattle's has enough more or interesting to say that warrants making a place on my already-groaning shelves.         --I really parted company with Rattle on the 3rd symhony. Its an interesting approach, to be sure. I ignored the 3rd for so many years but have started listening more carefully to those conductors who seem to \\"get it\\" (or seem to want to put more than the mere dutiful effort into trying.) This symphony has issues, and (even with 4 movements that end relatively softly), it just can't be beautifuled-away into the sunset. i was driving down the freeway yelling \\"noooooo\\" at my car stereo (more dangerous than texting? Perhaps. Try to avoid drivers with \\"\\"Brahms issues\\"...)    Sets I've gotten recently, and have felt get to the heart of things better:    --Walter (find the NY set, not just the Columbia set; both have merits. I prefer Columbia for 3 and 4, NY for 1 and 2)  --Jochum (I prefer the EMI/philharmonia 1 - 3, but I know the DG/Berlin set also has gotten raves)  --Mackerras in Teldec is a MUST...very interesting...at least 1 - 3; symphony 4 is lacklustre)  --Karajan, the 1964 set...they should reissue in a box. Getting them is a scavenger hunt  --Karajan, the1973 DVDs-sound not perfect, but to my mind GREAT renditions  --Toscanini-the Testament Philharmonia set....just picked this up used; absolutely splendid, (even with the blemishes).  --Furtwangler--for those who like even more excitement and have never learned how to spell \\"metronome\\", the Furtwangler set on Music and Arts is hair-raising (not just because of the renditions--extremely emotional and fervet, but also because of the time and circumstances under which they were recorded.)
B004XJHBCE|5.0|one of the best, if not the best, app I have. let's you organize your apps and free up space on your screens. highly recommended.

B004EPZ07K|4.0|I'll admit up front that I wasn't that familiar with the Green Lantern character before this movie. In fact, if I hadn't have talked to a friend who was a fan of the comics, everything I knew would have been from watching the old \\"Justice League\\" cartoons on Saturday mornings -- the ones in which Green Lantern was just another random face in the crowd. At least he wasn't the Wonder Twins, but Aquaman got more love than Green Lantern on that show. Thankfully, my friend explained why Green Lantern is so cool. I mean, having the power to create anything you can imagine... that's pretty awesome stuff. Obviously, the more imaginative the person, the better, and that was my main concern going in to this movie -- that the things the writers came up with for Green Lantern to create wouldn't be that creative. But I think they actually did a pretty good job in that department. Of course you have to keep in mind that he has to come up with these things on the spot, without a lot of time to sit around and think about it. The movie does have its flaws. There are a few scenes that feel cliche and it could have used a bit more action and a longer end fight, etc., but I still found it to be a fun, inspiring movie overall. I loved the \\"courage overcoming fear\\" storyline. As it turned out, it was the best time I had at the movies all summer.
076790592X|5.0|Life -- or death -- is what you make it.<br /><br />Perhaps it's this message which has made this little book such a huge success.<br /><br />In telling the story of Professor Morrie Schwartz's last days (and his last lessons) author Mitch Albom takes us inside one person's view of how to die.<br /><br />In a series of fourteen Tuesdays Morrie dispenses wisdom as he deals with the increasing ravages of Lou Gehrig's disease.  In order, Morrie talks about \\"the world,\\" \\"feeling sorry for yourself,\\" \\"regrets,\\" \\"death,\\" \\"family,\\" \\"emotions,\\" \\"the fear of aging,\\" \\"money,\\" \\"how love goes on,\\" \\"marriage,\\" \\"culture,\\" \\"forgiveness,\\" \\"the perfect day,\\" and finally \\"good bye.\\"<br /><br />In his teachings, Morrie shows the Buddhist influences that were so much a part of his religous world view.  But more importantly Morrie shows the undeniable humanity that was obviously so much a part of who he was.<br /><br />Life so much of American culture regarding death, the words are almost entirely for those left behind.  In that sense, what Morrie is reported as saying and how his final days were reported as being probably more comport with a vision of what we would like to death to be rather than maybe what it actually is.<br /><br />Frankly, the two times I've been present as someone lingered under the influence of a long illness, they were not able to match the demeanor Morrie was said to portray.  They had lived full lives but still left life kicking and screaming and leaving huge holes by their absence.<br /><br />Were their deaths, was Morrie's death part of some better larger plan?  On this question I would defer to the theologians.  Should they have stoically faced death repeating platitudes?  Or better:  were they entitled to their grief and legitimate self pity?  On these latter questions I find it easy to give a decided yes.<br /><br />Just as Morrie had his right to decide how he would face death, they did.  But more personally, we all too have the right because we all someday will walk Morrie's path.<br /><br />And in those final days or moments we'll exercise that right and I suspect, get from it, what we make of it.s we'll exercise that right and I suspect, get from it, what we make of it.

0393338827|5.0|... that's a characterization of Wall Street bankers author Michael Lewis quotes. After the financial crisis of 2008, I guess many will agree.    More and more people have claimed to have forseen the subprime loans crisis, that led to the crash of 2008. For some reason, hardly any of them had voiced their concerns before the collapse happened. Fewer still had put their money where their mouth was, and bet against the subprime market.    In broker talk, such bets are call \\"short\\": You promise to deliver a financial instrument - stock, bond, whatever - in the future, for a price that is fixed now. If the price goes down in the meantime, the difference is your profit. If it goes up... well, your customer wins, since you pay the difference. (The other side \\"longs\\" the financial instrument.)    A subprime loan is a loan for somebody who is not really that likely to pay it back in full. But if you have a lot of them, it seems likely that at least somebody will not default. Betting that not all of them will default is thus somewhat like giving a very reliable loan taker credit.    That, at least, was the common view on Wall Street. It led to a trillion dollar craze.    Some people thought it was utter ... nonsense. And bet their money that, sooner or later, the whole house of cards would collapse. They proved to be right. And made billions.    Michael Lewis found them. And tells their story.    The result is an insider look into an almost surreal world. It is well-informed, insightful, and very well written. Apart from a few sprinkles of (profound) analysis, the book vividly recounts the events as they were experiences by a handful of eccentrics. They bet against the handful of cynic crooks who knew what they were doing (but didn't care) and a mass of morons who bought heaps of financial titles without a clue what they actually represented.    The tale is as chilling and tragic as it is hilarious, and enlightening. Plus, Lewis creates more suspense than most thriller writers I know.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The Complete Collector's Edition of Blade Runner was done the right way. It includes all 4 official versions of the film plus Ridley Scott's 2007 Final Cut, giving fans the choice to watch any version they want.    When it comes to Star Wars, we can only get the latest re-imagining from George Lucas. The original movie is what made all the other movies/toys/etc. possible. Even when looking at it as film history, why is he so against releasing the originals?    I would be the first one in line to buy the Complete Star Wars Saga on Blu-ray if they included the Original Theatrical Versions in HD. As it stands, I'll just have to hold on to my Star Wars Trilogy laserdisc set that is still The Definitive Collection.
B004KV92ZE|4.0|This movie is fun for kids and adults.  Blu-ray looks great for these animated movies.  Of course buying through Amazon gets me the things I need quickly and usually cheaper than in regular stores.

B00081RV8U|5.0|This 1989 videotape is a full screen pan & scan dub.<br /><br />Directed by Martin Scorsese from Paul Schrader's semi-autobiographical script, TAXI DRIVER is depicts the emotional struggles of an self-isolated loser who through some cosmic joke becomes a hero after he attacks and murders three lowlifes. This when Travis Bickle's irrational plan to assassinate a presidential candidate at one of his rallies is thwarted by watchful Secret Service men.<br /><br />With nothing to fill his days with, ex-Vietnam vet Bickle accepts an overnight cabbie job that guarantees him very long hours. Unlike his fellow drivers, Travis is willing to take fares to the most dangerous areas of NYC. His brief friendship with an attractive gal ends badly and her rebuff sends him into a downward spiral of isolation and obsessive dreams of revenge against the decadent city he chooses to wander through. These sociopathic impulses play out in a most dramatic and explosive fashion.<br /><br />Ultimately, Travis seems to come out intact: calmer, seemingly sane, but one is left to wonder if he'll kill again someday.<br /><br />An undeniable modern classic and a chilling reflection of its bleak time. Features Bernard Herrmann's last film score, a darkly brooding jazz suite driven by saxman Tom Scott that nicely fits the story's mood.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.5) Taxi Driver (1976) - Robert De Niro/Jodie Foster/Cybill Shepherd/Harvey Keitel/Peter Boyle/Albert Brooks/Leonard Harris/Joe Spinell/Martin Scorsese
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Any fan of NASA and the Apollo program must have this set.  I have watched it more than a dozen times and will probably watch it a dozen more.  It is the perfect compliment to other Apollo documentaries.  Tom Hanks has done everything right in this one.  If you can find a friend who loves the space program and they don't already own this set, you must get it for them, they will absolutely love it.  I only wish they would make another series about more of the origins of our space program.

B005BZQS1E|1.0|THE stupidest movie I have EVER EVER watched. And I am a big movie buff. Natalie Portman? I thought I could always depend on you? Just plain stupid! I think whoever had this idea was trying to make fun of this era of movies, which I love. I did find myself laughing at the stupidity of it all. The reference to sex ever five seconds was just too much. Do not watch unless you feel like throwing your money away.
