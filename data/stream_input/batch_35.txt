B0083H5J8U|5|great product
B00JRE38EA|5|Amazing lights!!
B008G3BATI|5|Excellent.
B0006MTRJ2|5|Good for short distance use to water plants without having to unroll a long cumbersome hose.
B00G2TV7OG|5|These are super bright and work really well as reverse lights. I have them installed in aftermarket taillights on my Ford Expedition. They fit perfectly in the OEM light socket. Y of u just have to make sure that you have the polarity lined up right.
B007ZFU29W|5|Great!!! This has saved me some headaches and also is dishwasher safe. Great gift and also good for yourself.
B0028RZA7Q|5|An off the wall great gift idea for cooks and the kitchen. Quickly and accurately measures temperature of sauces, frying oils, and other stove-top and oven cooked foods. Hands-free, no-mess way to get an accurate temperature reading instantly. Worried hot water no hot enough? Infrared thermometer lets you know the temperature of hot water from the tap. Check seals on refrigerators, freezers and ovens for cold and heat loss.
B000NCZKUA|5|Perfect fit for the 2015 Double Cab Tundra and it was really easy to install!  Lays completely flat when you have it drawn tight, it almost looks like a hard plastic cover it is such a good fit.  I highly recommend it, you can't beat it for the price.
B008CFCMS8|3|It had a crack in it when I took it out of the box and flemsy but I had no choice but to use it. Otherwise it fits and is doing its job.
B00H2XC646|5|looks great I have not had to use it.
B007ZDDUCK|5|First, I love how it smells!  Almonds!  It took out surface scratches on handbags and made them look beautiful!  I had one bag that I stored improperly and it had a crease.  I used the Leather Milk and stuffed the bag. It has relaxed the leather and the crease is minimal, you have to really look for it.  Happy I found this product.  The previous reviews were right, it is wonderful!
B00B7GRJAA|1|Only lasted a week because the pin inside breaks...
B000F5JMEA|1|MM pins only, needed 1/4 inch. Should of listed on website. Says Toyota tool, didnt know that either. Not universal. Would like to keep if i could order pins I need...
B000FQ81B4|2|The gum is very soft, I'm not sure if it lasted as the original
B00GMRM54E|5|Best upgrade to my jeep yet and I have put in over $25,000 to my 2014 rubicon x so far amazing lights but now I have to get the matching fog lights damn you jw speaker for making amazing lights
B00DWKZQTK|5|Ordered a full opt7 kit for my truck 2 years ago and I had a bulb going in and out. These were bought as replacements, well worth the money
B004B61B34|3|Loose fit and CANNOT easily install without removing rear bumper.  Yes, if you have a garage and tools its not bad.
B002MQFTLU|4|As the backside of this door handle the lower picture you can clearly see a little white clip in the picture which did not come with my door handle . If the seller did not intend to have this clip with the door handle he shouls have omitted it I would not sell you a car pictured with tires and then when you get the car no tires would be on it. I lucked out and PEP BOYS had a assortment pack that have one in thier . Product fit and was the right color would have given a five but for the pictured clip missing
B00Z0B6C8I|4|Great fit, looks great. Exactly what I thought it would be. Nice think flat black frame with vinyl lettering.
B00UIC9GPA|1|Missing a eye when it arrive paid to much not to have two eyes
B0067MPZZA|5|Worked, much cheaper than having the dealership replace your lock.
B009G8CDYI|2|Not as robust as I expected.  It i bs nowlack all over, indicating leaking exhaust gasses.  Anyway... i got what i paid for<br />Been working for three months..
B0090149R0|3|the holes in the wires are too small fpr the posts on my inverter.
B00GNJX78Y|5|The product is fabulous, but the customer support is what really sets this company apart.  I bought mine second hand from a customer trading their car in, unaware previously that such a device even existed.  Well, I checked out the GROM website and install videos, plugged the sucker in, and...nothing.  I rechecked my install and reluctantly contacted GROM tech support.  They were FANTASTIC!  I was fully prepared to be turned down, or purchase a service contract, but they walked me through a few things, ending with a firmware update that fixed everything.  They acted like I was their most valued customer, and I didn't even buy it from them!  The device itself works great; you can load a bunch of small flash drives to mimic a 6 disc changer, using 6 albums or playlists.  You can also just load up a big flash drive with hundreds of songs and leave it set on random play if you don't want to fuss with playlists.  The Bluetooth connects automatically when you start the car just like an OEM setup, and mutes the music from the USB if a call comes in.
B00E9D4NES|4|For $7, it's definitely worth it. I bought them for my 2015 Chevy Cruze LS. The back was a tiny bit too small, but it still looks fine. The front was way too big, but using a razor or exact o knife you can easily trim the excess sticker away. After trimming the front, it looks really nice.
B00I6JTKSA|5|Fits perfect, perfect color and no problems in the months I've had them.
B001JT98S6|5|HEAVY DUTY!!!...THATS ME...OLD SCHOOL AND H/D!....<br />Proverbs 25:19  Amplified Bible (AMP)<br />Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint.
B008BYS3CE|1|I bought this and the look is amazing on the bike. Instructions said mount flush to frame so the license plate bracket won't break. So I did this and installed everything and thought it looked pretty good. Well about 3 short rides later I hear some rattling. The tabs that hold the clear plate lens in fell off which in turn the clear lens fell out. I then wrote NYC Choppers and asked for help with this issue and no response at all and forget about trying to get them on the phone. Riding around today and the whole thing snaps at the 90 degree bend and I start dragging it down the road. This thing is super thin metal and when your bike is running it shakes so badly from being flimsy that I guess thats what ended up braking the whole thing. Don't waste your money with this POS. Just my two cents.
B0002JN2EU|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B000C470BQ|5|Fits perfectly
B00MNQUE96|3|The straps don't work on passenger bench I guess if u removed seat put on and bolt back down maybe but they are protecting the seat.
B003OBPTV2|5|direct fit......
B00MJUELZ4|4|Very bright and the look I was going for. Only 4 stars because, out of the 5 lights, one was a dud.
B0057HAAII|3|Battery came leaked and messy.<br />Working fine though!! Great value!!
B00BGEO7DK|5|Is OK. I like the style. Passenger piece keeps moving around (only my drivers side of my truck has the clips to hold it)
B004YJ3WEO|5|This is the first thing I eve  perched on line  so far the PowerMax works  perfect  and I am not sorry I bought it.
B001KOI62O|5|Like the heading says, better to have it in there, than not.
B001O640XM|5|They are as advertised.  I like how they expand and the openings seem to maximize the ability to fill them up.  Looking forward to using them on my first big adventure.
B002P8R4JK|4|Fairly easy to install with help from friendly YouTube posts.  Mirror jiggles a little bit when the car is on the highway, but it looks great.
B010OM8MH6|5|Excelent kit
B003AOEAHC|5|As advertised. Fast shipping.
B0039752R2|3|Did not come as pictured in a cardboard box to protect in shipping but instead came in a plastic bag with no stick paper on one side only. Mine came in a shipping box that was a little too small and caused the outside two or three layers to curl up to each other and touch rendering them unusable . Perhaps if  there was non stick paper on both sides this might not have happened . Definitely needs to be packed in a shipping box that does not scrunch it. Product it's self is awesome , would always buy from 3m.  Lost 2 stars because of bulk packaging and shipping box too small
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Delivery was right on time, lights fit PERFECTLY and were actually brighter than I had expected, huge plus for me. Definitely will be a repeat customer!!
B000EDOT82|5|Fit great!
B000E8V9RG|5|The only filter I use for my vehicles and haven't let me down so far. I usually run these for over 10K miles before I change them.
B007PZW20E|4|High quality, well made.  Limited to only horizontal mounting.
B005FL1WVU|5|Great
B001UFQBAM|1|Great filters. Use them for Cerakote paint for firearm finishes
B00W8IMDQG|5|As advertised, large pet alert stickers - can't remember if you can remove them once stuck and replace elsewhere. I cleaned the outside window and when dry stuck it on. No need for redos or moving them.<br /><br />These must be stuck to the outside of windows otherwise you can't see the front.
B0002JMHSC|5|just like u said the product would be...thanks
B008UA4NUA|1|Not impressed. I think this conditioner did a very mediocre job. Actually, it did nothing and I actually think my $450 handbag looks tired and as though I never touched it. It didn't enhance anything and didn't mellow the bag's color. I would not recommend this product and felt it was a waste of money.
B0059KHB6C|1|This is the biggest piece of crap item I've dealt with in a long time. It is inexcusable that this is still the only option Kawasaki offers for their top of the line touring bike.  Seriously - we have to buy a 30 pin - Lightning connector even now, in 2015!?  AND - this is my THIRD unit - each of them have shorted out -- very cheaply and poorly made.  It's too bad this is over 100.00 and it's our only option.  RIDICULOUS!
B00B62MCRU|4|I'm sure it's already been notated but the front floor mats are just a bit short for the Fusion.  The mat fits in the depression that is in the floor board which leaves about 8-9 inches of floor space that you can put your foot for those that drive with one foot near their seat.  Other than that they are as advertised; the product is great this is the third set that I have purchased for 3 different vehicles.
B00QL3QJA0|5|good
B00YNF8SSE|5|does job
B00S2U69JG|4|Bought this for a 2007 BMW 335i. The OEM shift handle started to crack and peel which apparently is a common issue. Ordered this one which was half price of the BMW OEM. This version looks identical to the stock version except this version is fatter. It feels like your typical American shifter which tend to be fatter and that's how this one feels. If you prefer the stock, which feels much slimmer, I suggest you just purchase the OEM version. The silver on top is identical in shade as well. The shifter install easy as well. Just pull the old one off and slap this one in its place. All in all I'm glad I saved a few bucks and my center console looks new now that I got the old cracked shifter off.
B00H873X8E|5|Same as you can get at dealer but cheaper. Should come standard on vehicle.
B004ZF48OA|5|Very happy with kit. 55w 6000k gave me the exact color and brightness I wanted and expected.  Warm up quickly and built in resistor stops any code from being thrown.  Very happy with kit.
B00TDDCGNO|3|Bulbs were not nearly as bright as I expected they would be.
B006MX81FA|5|Very nice feel, easy to put on, nice look in my car, I am very happy.with my seat covers! It even came earlier than scheduled
B00KLIWMCU|5|I bought 2 sizes, one medium and one small. They are perfect sizes for our two cars (Nissan Altima and Toyota prius-c) and you can really notice the difference with and without the shade. Price was great and it came really fast. One of them took more days, which I found weird, especially knowing I place the order at the same time and from the same vendor. However no complaints, I got both of them and they arrived when they were supposed to.
B00CGK3GOY|4|Nice. Not quite a perfect fit but close enough.
B0006PJJC4|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00IOW4USE|5|Installed by myself. Yes it is more expensive than 3rd party, but I just did not want the chance of something not working right. Took about 30 minutes to install, instructions were very clear. Easy to plug in and go. Mounted with OEM hitch. If you want no hassle install then this is the route to go. Very easy DIY for a non automotive techie like me.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Great price
B00IDDD2BU|5|very  good product so far, great price, love the extra wide on my razor gain more stability
B004YJP4WW|5|No difference from the one I changed out, just not broken like mine...lol
B004GE32BK|5|Looks and fit perfect.
B00HVHFOI8|4|good , it helps protect my keys
B000WJCT80|4|Rim Lock was easy to install, although it made it much more difficult to mount and balance the tire, which was expected.
B000182F0Y|5|Perfect fit and easy to install!! My husband loves them:)
B00LT424T6|2|Broke after using it on my keys for only two weeks and the fan part has come loose because the pin fell out.
B004JNJPLY|1|Really easy to install. FIT GREAT. Too bad the cords split 2 months later... definitely NEVER buying after market again. I wish i can write another review from what a terrible product this was.
B000GU3KHO|4|It fits perfect. The cover goes over the tires to the ground. Nice cover
B001RM4R86|5|Excellent plug.
B0068ERNNE|5|Really nice gear, everything I need for rainy season. Unfortunately it arrived about ten days and eighteen inches of rain late.
B000AME50Y|2|Tried it when i received it and saw no changes to scrapes or swirls
B001V8RYTA|4|A good product, but the stakes do bend too easily.
B005OCZPI6|5|great product
B003Y323NC|5|Very, very good product that offers tons of information.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I love this product it does the job perfectly as advertised. Many times this product has stopped my cellphone, loose change and other items from falling into the gap between my seats. This product has probably saved my life from stopping me from being distracted when i drive. I bought a pair for each of my family members. They all say they love Drop-Stop and that they cant drive without it installed in their car's.
B001DRHMRI|5|Excellent product.  Exceeded expectations.
B000N4PT1S|5|As described and great value
B008RAD3NG|5|Its the best thing since sliced bread.
B00YILXTP0|5|Love the quality ! I get many compliments how cute shade is ! Perfect fit !
B009CY6JPA|5|They look awesome on my Pontiac G8! I put them on the lower part of my front fenders right above the body line that follows down the side of the car. I'm only 31 years old but being a car enthusiast I love how the red stands out. It completely reminds me of the emblems on the Pontiacs from the late 60's.  Extended review: Now September 2016 and the red is fading away. Thinking about looking for actual emblems with an overlay. They looked cool while they lasted. Also, careful waxing or drying your car. The cloth can snag a corner of the emblem and bend the corner out.
B00BTLEJXI|5|I love what I purchased! No regrets! Shipment came on time.
B004GEHVJ4|2|Not built to OEM specs and dimensions.  Expect a poor fitting item which will requires lots of bending, grinding, and new holes and slotting of existing holes.
B007IY26VC|5|love it
B0098KY67G|5|Looks great!
B00020CASS|5|Solid wood roller, it will do the job well
B004A34G94|5|Direct replacement for what I had. Easy to install @ good price. Received it 2 days after I ordered it. great experience all the way around.
B00YB5GAEA|4|Works well and has a good battery life. Didn't attach to my helmet or have a clip for my backpack but seems to be hanging on to my seat nicely.
B00QXVUS52|1|Does not fit my 2015 Chevy Equinox even though the selection process here indicates it should. Something is off about the threading as the replacement antenna will not screw into place. Went to the local Chevy dealer and paid just $6 more for the correct antenna. The genuine AC Delco part from both vendors comes in a sealed plastic bag that says item can't be returned if bag has been opened. So I wasted $16 dollars trying to save $6. The correct part number for my Equinox was 22969192.
B007AKTKZY|5|I bought this for my Dad. He has a 57 Thunderbird. It has a heavy quality feel, not light and cheap, and looks very elegant. He will be able to carry this with pride with his pride and joy car.
B00IKJCSO4|5|I ordered 2 front and 2 rear struts. They arrived on time and altho the boxes were heavy they didnt show damage.<br /><br />Mechanics installed them without any issues.  Unfortunately after driving the car, it became apparent that the front set were locking up / malfunctioning.<br /><br />I reached out to Prime Choice about the issue. The immediately responded and a replacement set have been installed. The car runs great.<br /><br />Customer Service was great. I'll use them again and recommend them to others.
B0055DRXO8|3|came with holes already both, no problems returning
B00A7F76CI|5|Great filters. Use them for Cerakote paint for firearm finishes.
B00888EPSY|5|Fast shipping and great product!
B008DETNBW|2|Rear springs are weaker, which causes rubbing, wear and a rough ride for my turbo veloster. I've tried spring boosters and expanders, but honestly just buy coilovers to save time and money in the long run.
B0075VS46Y|1|Bought on June 2, 2015. Worked great for about 2 weeks with daily use and overnight charge. After those two weeks, we might get about 5 minutes of good performance. Dissapointed
B001EAQTRI|5|Really cut out the noise.
B000C2UABK|5|Excellent replacement part for my '69 el Camino
B000VXA7C2|5|works well to keep down the fog
B000COB5N0|5|Exact fit and a perfect replacement.
B00099DW6G|5|Powerful
B00KIC8W6O|3|Would be better it the adhesive tape came with it.
B002PUWXZI|5|Big, big hit! Looks great too !
B00LMNBAVW|5|Did its job
B0001EXBOW|4|I had to retire my old bug deflector after 17 years of faithful service.  One too many trips through the car wash finally split the brittle plastic and I had to find a suitable replacement.  My only issue is we used to be able to buy deflectors the color of our vehicles but not anymore.  I finally caved and bought this one and hope it lasts as long as my first one..  I would have given it 5 stars had I been able to buy one the color of my truck.  It went on in mere minutes.  I would caution users to line up the shield from side to side and not from the middle. I got mine off by about an eighth of an inch by using the middle as a reference point from the underside of the hood.  That said, there are no real problems or issues to worry about with this shield.
B00WH6LXA6|5|Perfect in every way- top quality and quick delivery!
B004C6OBBC|5|It works, and was shipped promptly
B005IFCFPK|3|It hangs very strangely. It's almost as if you have to put something in it to keep it taut. Kind of a bummer...but the quality of the material and the pockets are nice.
B003NDI6V6|5|What an improvement in performance.  Not much off the line but once you are moving you can feel it in your back.  The engine noise is wonderful.<br />Only comment is regarding the 90 minute installation time.  I've been turning wrenches on cars since I was 14 years old and did lots of performance related work on my 4 previously owned Z's.  The 90 minutes noted had to be somebodies dream.  Bu,t no matter, it was worth it.
B005FL57XE|5|This kit came with everything i need it. Nice! Follow instructions ppl.
B001TXMOW4|5|I have used it on my four wheelers, but not my bike yet.  Its great and has anything u can think of for quick repairs while out on the road.  Rolls up small and fits in my side pouch on my tail bag of my bmwgs650
B0036TY5GC|1|They did not fit as expected.  They looked very &#34;clunky.&#34;  Maybe a good product for a mud machine, mainly for the purpose of mud splatter, but for sleek looks, not really.
B000EDUUL2|5|works great with the RV
B00GJMQM3W|5|good
B000T7HE7Q|1|Wire harness is way too short for boat applications. I ended up having to splice 4 feet of wire to the ends of the harness to make the run to the mounting locations of the lights on my trailer.  My boat trailer is sized for my 18.5 ft boat. It is completely unacceptable that a light kit designed as &#34;submersible&#34; (presubably for boats) does not ship with a harness suitable for boat applications.<br /><br />Additionally, the wiring harness does not include a ground wire that runs the length of the trailer. This means you may have to drill new grounding points for lights. Not fun.<br /><br />Lights are great, but the harness is terrible.
B00CHD27FE|5|Looks great and arrived early
B00480J4QY|5|While they're definitely whiter than the OEM bulbs, they aren't WHITE white, so don't expect them to compete with HID bulbs or anything. But for halogens, I'm very satisfied with the color. I have 5000K LEDs in my marker lights, and OEM bulbs in my fogs. The new headlight bulbs are almost exactly in between the two colors, closer to the LEDs if anything.<br /><br />You won't really tell the color difference when looking at them (unless side by side with OEMs), but I definitely noticed the color difference when driving at night.<br /><br />Price wise, they are very good in my opinion. I have Sylvania ZXE bulbs in my other truck, and while they are a touch (and I do mean barely) whiter, they're not worth the ~$40 difference. Assuming these hold up, I will likely use these as my go-to replacements.<br /><br />We'll see how long they actually hold up. So far though, very happy with them.
B00B2A2BVI|5|exelente
B00DM9WATU|5|Works great, saved me a ton of money, dealer wanted over $500 for the half shaft!
B0001EXM7I|5|Fit nicely, easy to install
B010DKSS3W|1|It's not reinforced at all..Even ID is not 5/8..
B00K332SKE|3|The bracket works and was delivered in a timely fashion and with all the correct hardware and good directions.  The reason I wanted a stand off bracket so I did not have to drill holes in my front bumper plastic.  The website that took me to this bracket I was searching for clip on bracket for 2015 Camaro and it took me to Mikes  performance parts.  It was not clear on Mike's site that this bracket also had to have holes drilled.  It works and since it cost so much I used it but am not happy that the websites parts could not be easier to find a no drill bracket for front plates or easier to use so I knew it still required me to drill holes.
B00498WM50|4|Had to modify brake wire clip from a round hole to a rectangle for clip to snap in. Otherwise it installed great.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|6 month. so far so good.
B004SGDY28|5|Direct plug-n-play replacement, allowed me to get rid of the old electromechanical regulator in my Ford Falcon.
B005JZUALA|5|Good price.....nice product
B007S0H5DU|5|This product is far & above the best of any other RV Holding Tank Treatment. It really works!
B00M5YH3AY|5|What an awesome little switch. Easy to wire. Looks great in my xterra.
B000GKAZVI|5|These things are PERFECT. Easy to install and I have not had any issues what so ever. I am using these to protect my door from hitting the wall. I just bought a brand new Corvette so I was extremely happy with my purchase
B003VARGM6|5|Used to cover a window in our daughters bedroom in our campers...worked perfectly!
B000CIAW8K|1|Junk don't buy  had professionally installed only lasted about 30 days  rip off
B00FTTVX2G|5|Perfect product for my 2015 Silverado Double Cab!
B009OAWPTG|1|i am disgusted with the quality of this product. I have had this jacket for about a month and have only gone on a few rides with it. The seams are coming apart in the sleeves. The stitching is terrible. It is almost like a grade school kid tried sewing felt together for the first time. I am just passed the return policy date and now screwed with a 130 dollar piece of garbage.
B00BAZC1SS|1|Ordered red and got one that was pink
B000BZAED2|5|Timken Quality!! Exact fit 2002 Super Duty. Used with Timken NP 064306 race. This is rear inner.
B003RY53U8|5|Great cups--love the insulation. Delivery was great.
B005ZH402C|5|great stuff
B002UZG3G8|4|The seat is certainly comfortable enough and it bolted right on to my older model Snapper.  The wideness of the seat makes it a little difficult to maintain your place when cutting sideways on a hill.  The price was better than OE, so I am not complaining.
B0002VAZ34|4|Ok
B001CUNFGI|5|Works as advertised.
B006NZTZLQ|5|Product works great
B00466AJ6Y|5|These bandannas are very nice.  They are much prettier than what you would find at your average, brick and mortar retailer.
B003RX14KW|5|great product and company to deal with
B00029CYRG|5|Awesome stuff!!! Wish I found it years ago.
B00I56SMJW|5|Great light kit! Very clear and bright!
B0012GTVVA|5|nice
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I ordered this size for my Prius gen 2 but it is much too small. However, the product quality is good and I will continue to use this shade to keep at least some heat out of my car.<br /><br />I contacted customer support and I will be receiving a larger size. I will update my review once I receive the large size.
B0002KKIXC|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B002GTPF9E|5|Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.
B009I6EL8O|5|I had my 1980 Toyota pickup repainted and the  old bumper had lost most  of it chrome, this was cheaper than replating the old one.
B00NVR6CJM|3|It's a decent magnetic bumper sticker. Would have given it 5 stars but mine came with a small a wrinkle in it.
B002R0BU2I|4|Repainted the truck these were faded.
B004BCHJMU|4|Just put in my two headlight assemblies.  Got them both done in 3 hours...not bad for a novice.  They have really made a difference.  I just need to adjust them now as they are pointing a little too high up.  I gave this deal a 4-start due to the fact the add said it included bulbs.  It came with no bulbs.  I hit up AutoLightBulbs and they said &#34;it doesn't come with bulbs, but we discounted the price to reflect this change in order&#34;.<br /><br />Middle of the range light bulbs cost me an additional $40.  So add that to your $80 cost for these assemblies.
B0027QWNDM|5|Very handy
B000GV1DFE|5|One of very few products that actually &#34;bolted in&#34; without modification on my project bike, superb quality! The clutch alone is something Harley can take lessons from! the clutch lever pull is as smooth as any bike I have ever ridden with gradual and positive engagement . I totally recommend this product.
B005JVERFY|5|Seems to be going well for me.  :D
B00B011K48|3|It's the original part, fits right into place without issues. The reason for only 3 stars it will break just like the one that came with the car in a short time, the tabs are too weak and break of. That's a Dodge issue, not the seller's issue.
B007G7PUMS|5|There is no substitute
B001068672|5|Installed on 1988 Toyota MR2 Supercharged. Great one step colder replacement for applications with a little more boost than stock.
B00JRJG45U|5|It's so easy to install, as long as your old one isn't stuck inside. Performs and looks like original.
B005ESEU8G|5|They fit 2015 Ram 1500 Crew Cab just right.
B00AQUXK9C|4|I've only had this started for a few months now but it seems to have no problems starting my Victory with a S&S 106 Stroker in it. That's allot of compression and it  works fine.
B00QYIFSUO|5|Wiring harness and switch were of great quality. Easy to install. And come on the switch says Zombie Lights!
B005JU5VUK|1|Extremely disappointed in this product.  It does not fit a Ford Fiesta, nor does the 15&#34;.
B009DN75OY|4|Exactly what was needed. Works perfectly. So far, so good.
B003E1SJVY|5|I have used this in my outboard for several years now... I am impressed that my outboard starts on the first crank after sitting idle for over 8 months... So it only made sense to expand its use in other gasoline engines tht I operate at home..<br /><br /> While this product at first seems expensive... 1 oz treats almost 8 gallons of gasoline that contains ethanol... While this product is advertised for marine engines I bought this additive thru Amazon to protect my 2 cycle lawn care products (chain saws, blowers, trimmers, weed wackers) as well as my 4 cycle lawnmowers... Ethanol really is bad for any gasoline engine... Then compound the fact that fuel can sit in your lawn care products for several months or more... The shelf life of gasoline with ethanol is short... Like 3 to 4 weeks as the ethanol absorbs water which means a loss in engine performance as well as engine corrosion.... A friend of mine had recommended this product over Sta-Bil which is an enzyme based product ... The Valvtect formulation is supposed to be over 130% more efficient with regards to stability...<br /><br />This additive keeps your fuel stabilized for up to a year or more...
B00XWDYSWS|1|Zero stars . Can't be programmed for my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Tried at dealer and locksmith. Useless. No wonder it's no longer available.
B00LNGSY76|1|Had no luck at getting this on the steering wheel.  Got a blood blister on a finger and when using a table knife to get it on, it tore.  So it's no good.  Loved the looks, but just couldn't get it on!
B00JUQFVX6|5|Perfect!
B000DT7UQK|5|Perfect fit!
B007PZC4A2|5|Fits nicely over my Internationals transmission brake handle, and mounts easily to the floor.  I used larger self tapping sheet metal screws. Covered a fairly large opening, 8x6 I believe, somewhere in that neighborhood.
B00L7EYT64|5|nice stuff
B005E0N1JI|5|they work great
B00DMALTWS|5|Absolutely adorable! Love it!
B0009IBJE4|5|Does just what it needs to.  I bought this to charge up my deep cycle RV batteries and I just hook them up, hit the appropriate button, and walk away.  According to my tester (which shows them with 1.26 specific gravity when charged) his charger brings them up to 100% and shuts off just like it should.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Love it!
B00NTYTJ8I|4|These are nice caps, they look good and the material is durable. However, the tiny set-screws are not worth the effort. They began to rust after only a couple of weeks; removed to avoid contaminating the caps. The good news: using a simple & small crescent wrench the valve caps can be tightened enough beyond hand tight to negate the value of the set-screws. If someone is looking to steal them and they have to use a wrench, there isn't much difference between a small hex and a crescent (note that using pliers will probably ruin them anyway). End of the day, if they want them, they'll take them...
B006LO3JPM|5|loving every minute of this hood cover! AWESOME!
B003U1Q47E|5|Fit exactly as it should. Prompt shipping and a very fair price.
B000FVDJ5M|5|Exactly what I wanted. The gas cap is a little harder to get to but that is to be expected. Took about 10 minutes to install
B003SJJRMC|4|qquality set of springs-looks as good as OEM Parts
B002P4C63S|5|Works great, easy to install.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Great little kit for the money.  Handy to have in the glove box when you're without a full set of tools.
B00H7HD9DO|1|LESS than a one star!  Straps come off easy preventing you from attaching securely.  Backseat cover is a JOKE..no holes for seat belts / cut holes for seat belts (as instructed) and the material rips and start running..when you do get the back seat cover on when you unzip it to take drink carrier down both sides do no hold in place..  Totally waste of money and time...
B00EXAA0YO|5|Very good
B009FKWTO6|5|All the local part stores said I had to buy the whole compressor in order to replace the clutch and pulley. Well, the compressor wasn't bad, and I found this product. One of the reviews said the part only lasted a few months, but I only use A/C three months out of the year. So I decided to give this product a shot, and try to save some cash.<br />It has been installed for a few Weeks now, and works fine. Make sure the model number on the currently installed compressor is compatible before buying this product
B000UOBIZC|5|Great for price and same as what is in the RV stores.
B00GWG9HTG|5|Fit I s good
B00199HXFQ|4|Fit perfectly, arrived as promised.
B000W0WSPI|4|A bit pricey but useful
B00R6GU5WY|5|This lock looks and feels great. It is very sturdy and solid. It wiggles a little but when on the steering wheel, but just take the time to find the right position for it.
B004HIVFDC|5|The kids loved having their own travel bug. They are excellent quality and a good value. Thanks!
B0002ILK72|2|Didn't last 6 months, plus will not take a charge.
B00X7FF3Q6|5|Perfect fit! Easy install! Exactly as described.
B0073WEZU4|5|Looks MUCH better than the standard issue that came with the truck.
B00BFDHNTM|5|Perfect fitment! Everything was included for the install besides instructions but that can be found online.
B005HVG4GQ|5|A great tester
B000C9DV0U|5|Excellent product, I get super fast! I recommend it 100%.
B0027UKMFE|5|bolted right up to existing holes on frame
B0074A8ZA6|5|Looks great! Fits perfect in my 350Z! Great option to make the best use of the limited space in a &#34;Z&#34;!
B00774647U|2|This faded very quickly.
B004GCA2HO|5|Great part
B007OC3WMU|5|Nice!
B00B7WXO7G|1|Dosent fit right didn't go together how it should no instructions
B00230QCIY|5|fast shipping, item was as described
B0002KKJV8|4|It helped
B00W2M6VNY|5|very good
B00KQXKG46|5|great product. easy to install and lots of light.
B0044PSBOE|5|quality product!
B0127UWLKC|5|The quality was just as I expected.  I plan on buying a Dr. Ben Carson Sticker soon, more Trump Stickers for some friends.
B001UEJJUC|5|perfect
B00KTNQXL8|5|Nice and bigger than I thought.  Colors are rich, nice quality.
B00265FXFY|1|Purchased this bulb in February of 2015 and 6 months later It no longer works and of course my warranty expired.  Now I must look for another bulbs....<br />Extremely disappointed in the product
B000F5HUTO|5|pops the ball joints right out, manually or with the air hammer ive had zero issues with heavy use.
B00HRHWHNW|5|Excellent product
B003S8KFGU|5|First 3 places  I visited to get keys cut -  refused to cut new keys from the 2 blanks purchased.  A certified Locksmith even said blanks I purchased might be hard enough metal to damage their key cutting machine!  However, a Sears concessionaire agreed to cut my blanks for $4 each, IF I would not hold him responsible - if the keys he cut didn't work.  After keys were cut, I inserted keys into the ignition, both keys turned easily, and the A/C came on - a good sign.  Programming the keys was super easy - much easier than programming remotes for the Ford Taurus  So, I'm a Happy Camper!!
B0012P2P3C|5|car rides better
B004I12RYE|5|Took just minutes to install and looks as good as the original!
B003VAUMAE|3|Spent almost $700 on the Brakemaster, $950 on installation, $100 on an adapter, the Brakemaster 9160 had a leak and Brakemaster told us they would replace the part but not pay for the labor which was another $300 ...
B00LVTLC6U|4|work very good
B00DNDBJVK|3|It is very flimsy and smaller than I have had in the past.  You get what you pay for.  But for Florida it is fine.  I'll deal with it.
B007PP26RI|1|I used this as directed.  I cleaned the two parts and used the product as directed, on surfaces that were recommended.  All three areas of application failed to hold.  This was at room temp, and not high heat.  Unfortunately, this now has cost me many hours of dis-assembly and clean up work so I can re-assemble and do a traditional weld.  I should have trusted my gut, and known this products claims were too good to be true.  I rarely, if ever write bad reviews, and I'm taking the time to write this one so that others can avoid the same mistake.<br /><br />Amazon issued me a refund, and is a class act.
B0083H5JCQ|5|great product
B00153ZBH8|5|This is a rear inner race. I used with a Timken NP114036 rear inner bearing. Timken is U.S.A. Quality!!! It was installed on a 2002 F250 Super Duty.
B00BEXGPVA|4|The frame is a dark gray chrome. Darker than the photo. But that was what I was hoping for as I was trying to match my 2015 ford explorer XLT appearance package which is trimmed in a &#34;magnetic, or pewter&#34; type of color. My only complaint is that the screw covers are not the same color as the frame. (Look very closely at the first picture). The screw covers are black which, in my opinion, takes away from its great look. I do live in the Midwest and have fears over corrosion this coming winter though. I will update my review accordingly.
B001G9CJQW|5|Well thought out sway bar.
B00J3DDD9U|5|Love this dash cover
B00XNPAEOQ|5|Great Product, Delivered as described.
B0009IQZPW|4|These do the job. They work to apply meguiar's products and do it well. there is nothing really fancy about these it could be beter but they do the job and cant complain.
B00996LBT0|5|I love the decal! It was a bit smaller than the Operation Enduring Freedom but it serves it's purpose. Don't see too many veterans who support being in OIF but I'm the first in my area. Thanks, seller!
B00701NBOO|4|kind of clumsy
B00MGGDTNQ|4|Plates are of good quality, they used decal stickers for the writing, which looks good but was hoping for print.
B000E4COMO|4|Was a decent after market mirror. Looks good ,but a little too light weight.
B00SGGT8H6|5|I previously purchased an OEM cargo mat, but it had proven to be a pain as I had third row seat.  Each time I want to use the third row, I had to remove the cargo mat from my car leaving the area behind the third row exposed when you have grocery or luggage.<br /><br />After a while, I got fed up, and decided to purchase this cargo mat.  The package was delivered quickly through Amazon Prime.  It fit my 2015 X5 (F15) perfectly.  It is more pricey compared to the OEM cargo mat, but is much lighter.  More importantly, this mat is fold-able which works well with my third row.
B000C59ZBI|1|Number one NOT a real Moog K8123 part, and number 2 from Taiwan, really... the average consumer is much smarter than that. Amazon was nice enough to make sure I got 100% refund. Just Suspension, humm... seemed a bit shady, advertise one part then send a cheap part.
B0081ZZF74|4|Does the job and made the power brakes better. If you have a big cam you need this.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B0038B23TY|5|These are very nice looking lights a make a good alternative to factory lights.
B001RUKWO6|3|Pricey and did not notice much of a difference than cheaper carpet cleaners I've found at local stores.
B00R8D5F8O|5|Perfect!!
B002PGSH0M|5|Fit my mustang perfectly.  Price was very reasonable, and my car is driving smoothly again.  Thanks!
B002OMSDJM|5|excellent product fast delivery,really satisfied...
B000NSL9ZO|4|FYI these are knurled. Seem to be built well. Time will tell.
B00BITRC4Y|4|Is what it is and worked correctly
B00Q7ACB90|4|I would rate this a 5 star for looks and easy installation but as of right now the right cover seems to be loose.  We will watch it but the handles & mirror covers look great
B00877DBKY|5|just cool
B00VNJ4PEO|1|did not fit
B0009JKI72|5|Works great and love the price.  Lots less than dealer or auto supply stores.
B00BAZBYTU|1|After a couple of months the color (black) wore off exposing an annoying brass color.
B000C59XGU|5|Solid construction
B006LI7FCQ|5|i am very impressed with this seat and the speed at which it was delivered.  The seat is very nice quality, very comfortable and was easy to install.  I have paid more for other types of seats from dealerships and this seat is by far a much nicer option.  We do lots of trail riding, usually 100 miles plus each trip and having the extra storage and a comfortable seat for the second rider is very important.  I would recommend this seat to anyone!
B0000AZ8JB|5|Great visibility easy to adjust. Convex design gives you increased view. Suction cup holds great even with crosswind or higher speed. A++
B0031I9ZJK|5|Works very well.  I was having issues with my TrailBlazer reporting extremely inaccurate temperatures during hot restarts.  This is tied to the HVAC system, so because it would think that it was -30 degrees even though it may be 100+ outside.  This would turn off the A/C even though it was extremely hot.  After driving 5+ minutes, it would slowly return to the correct temperature.  This replacement resolved it and my A/C is working as it should.  Fantastic price!
B005LOS60Q|5|Looks custom.
B00KJ9V7C2|1|Buyer beware, I have checked the fittment against my paticular bike (2005 Honda CRF250X) various websites all claim the same thing, it should work. 2 of the bearings are about 15mm larger than OEM, obviously they do not work. I'm going to contact Hot Rods about this issue as I have the rest of the kit installed already. Nothing against the seller, their service was great.
B00FAYLPZK|4|did a nice job
B000C846U0|1|Didn't fit the car it said it would fit.  Complete waste of money
B00O3QB67S|5|Easy install on my 2001 Subie Forrester. I'm still able to lower the sun visors with no problem.
B001J9POPW|5|Original BMW mats. Great people to work with
B002EOAM80|5|AVS is a good reliable brand and fits perfectly.
B00CZBQCR2|5|Worked great...thanks!
B006U42QUC|5|Works perfectly in Honda 2015 CRV. Would buy another if I had another CRV. Well worth the money.
B004UTCYVK|5|I love them! They look fantastic on my car!! Thanks a lot! They arrived on time, the product was as shown and described!! Love love love it :)
B000CITK8S|5|They work great.  I need to order more for all my outdoor toys.
B00SIQH8A8|5|This won't protect your car from major impacts, but it's perfect for the minor dings you get from other cars in garages or parking lots. Also, it's a helluva deal and really easy to put together. Also, the magnetic strip doesn't harm your car's finish.
B00UOBX7N2|4|Fits ok small gap at top look good I can live with it
B00T0WZ3VA|5|Excelent product, easy installation
B00772F6AI|5|Perfect Fit  -  Took about  1/2 hour  - Next time 15 Minutes max  - Fit is Perfect - Used OEM Painted Existing cover - Plugs were exact fit and it functions correctly -  Recommend to any one who has a SL500. ( Mine is a 1997 ) Save yourself 600.00 on OEM
B00GURJZZI|5|Awesome. Got a Sunny 50cc scooter for free. It had been sitting for 2+ years with a full tank of gas. Got this carb. Put it on. Put good gas in and it started right up. After a little bit of idle tuning runs like new. Highly recommend.
B000EDOSN8|4|Perfect to put over the vent cover that is above our bed in our travel trailer. Looked up install videos on YouTube and easy to do myself.
B00YJWYU7O|4|Nice brake pads for the money
B008ZE8ZXM|5|Great product... And very fast shipping...
B00IT2Z6EQ|5|Worked perfectly, easy to install.
B00R1EIMA8|4|Fit nicely, easy install. Have to give it some time to see how it last. I'll rebuild my old starter as a backup. Price was right, shipping good also.
B00MPJ3CJA|5|Worked and fit great
B005VSIHHE|5|Good product and fast delivery.
B00GDL0M76|5|Excellent
B000C9SNFI|5|Car running
B009MATH8K|5|Perfect fit!
B00EKTJMLA|5|Fit on my F-250 perfectly
B00W1ZDIGA|1|I was very displeased with this purchase! One of the frames the acrylic part pealed away from the chrome on the bottom and the other one one of letters came out on the first wash after I placed it on.
B00GNG9N30|5|works great does everything it was expected to do.
B005GN23HE|5|They work great, engine runs smooth.
B004Q864Q6|4|Fits great. Matches great. Keeps stuff in one place out of the way
B00E7WEFQ2|5|We surprised our daughter with a car for her 16th birthday she loves the lashes
B001GJ3FIS|5|Good product.
B007I8RP32|5|very economical and leave a very clean surface behind
B000M5Y72A|5|These are really bright. They arrived safe and we're easy to put in. I would purchase for this seller again if I needed to
B00LNK9PLQ|2|Silver shows thru the spray paint.
B0041QKZTA|5|Couldn't find a replacement for my &#34;Hawk&#34; helmet brand shield.  Every outlet said it was &#34;unavailable.  Didn't want to lose a good helmet. This looked like a close fit.  To my surprise it is exactly what I needed.
B007V2DFY8|5|Nice
B0040CTTH4|5|They worked just great no problem at all
B000CD383G|5|great shocks
B001DKN9MM|5|Worked well!
B00496F0HY|5|Very good wiper blades.  They installed easily in less than 5 minutes for both.  We have been using them for the past month and they seem to be a very good quality blade.  No problems or issues so far!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy to setup
B007PBPI68|5|Great reverse lights on the Jeep.
B004PILLZG|4|Works great for heat...but sound...not so much
B003FG6KIW|5|Was the one for my 2004 expedition. Had about 5oz of pag 46 oil in it. Make sure to pull old bolt spacers out of old unit and I had to connect wire harness first when installing as it is on top and out of reach once bolted in place.  Original had harness on bottom. So far working great and saved alot of money.
B00O72R7Z8|1|It's a really nice wireing over all  harness but it's NOT for a LED light bar it just has slandered wire connector on it. With is no problem I just have to cut off the plug on the light bar and change it witch is why j was buying the wire harness so I wouldn't have to do that.<br />But over all it's a really nice wire kit nice switch and  realy you wouldn't be able to go but all the stuff individually for the price is wearing harness so for that I would probably buy  individually for the price wearing harness so probably more.
B009MATEPG|5|PERFECT fit and INSTANT heat reduction.  Summer has been brutal and I didn't want the sun killing our new dash in our Sprinter RV.  It worked so well for heat reduction while parked in storage, I think I will use it in lieu of the privacy window wrap that came with the camper!  I can;t wait for the side window covers to arrive!
B00IK4CUHE|5|First time attempting to install lift supports.  Simple instructions included and very easy to install.  Just what the Dr. ordered.
B00AZPP0Y6|5|Nice light, great price !!!
B00NNFT09G|5|great product
B003X9TLUK|5|Works great. Very happy
B00GSAUHB8|5|Have tried numerous sun shields over the years and nothing really stood out. This product is head & shoulders better than anything on the market that I've seen thus far. And the proof was confirmed a couple weeks ago in Louisiana when temps stayed around 105 degrees for several days. And my black Yukon sat in the blacktop parking lot all day. I was shocked when I got back in the vehicle to go home and it felt unbelievably comfortable. I'm sold on this product and telling everybody at work to try it!
B004LF3HQO|5|Works as advertised!
B000C7UMCM|2|i wont buy it again
B00PE6TVAU|5|Very good product this far. Have used for about 3 weeks. No issues this far.
B00898LAJ0|4|Fits good and works as expected, vibration is not to bad, but should be expected.
B002P8T29A|5|Fits perfectly and was delivered on time.
B00BMRZN66|5|This is fantastic.  I have a lawn business and this will save time gassing up all my machines from gas cans.  Look forward to receiving my free hand pump.
B00OZYHOE2|4|Haven't ridden with these, yet, but the look as I expected.  Still looks like I'll get some airflow under the goggles, and when doing off road riding, I was hoping to keep the dust out.  Stay tuned...
B003BZD08U|5|keeps water flow safe
B001D51GTU|4|Served its purpose. Seems like a well made piece.
B001FRPXS6|5|Great piece of gear.  Better than OEM.
B00A14QLMG|5|Work great.
B003OG0XK4|1|This is the worst product I have bought, do not waste your money, it is not worth a cent.  The suction cup does not work and the plastic is soo flimsy, I put it where it deserves in the garbage. Too bad I can't put a minus star rating.
B0067ECRP4|5|Great filter, next oil change oil was noticeable better than store brand filter.
B004NBEFXA|5|worked well
B000BGJWA2|5|worked. had to cut out bottom to fit 50 amp plug through it though.
B002WTHW26|5|Mercedes spec ABC hydraulic fluid at a better price. Flush your ABC system today and save big buck in repairs later.
B00MC6DMWI|5|The drums work pretty well  and the delivery was really fast. All in all a good quality product.
B003DFIW1S|5|just what the trolling motor ordered.
B005BNZGCS|5|Works as advertised, nothing special.
B00D2LOT9C|5|Works well
B00UJCJI4I|5|Awesome deal!
B006QGD996|5|Gave these as a gift to my dad. He loves them. Small yet easy to use fit tight spots.
B0012ZITJQ|5|Best products for cleaning my V Strom, great price.
B009DJ2NPE|5|This has been great. I normally buy K&N filters because of the ability to clean them and reuse them. I saw this was $20 cheaper and decided to try it.<br /><br />When I got it, I compared it to the K&N in our other car and its pretty much identical in how its built. Honestly really cant tell the difference besides a slight color difference (K&N is purpleish and this one is red)<br /><br />It's been in my corolla for about 5K miles now. Serving its purpose.<br /><br />Just know that these are oiled filters. DO NOT put too much oil it will ruin your MAF sensor. A lot of people put too much oil, you dont need a whole lot.<br /><br />As for performance, I honestly can't tell a difference even with my small engine (1 horsepower is almost noticeable in this thing). But these are totally worth it for the ability to clean and reuse.
B00DLMMZ3Y|5|Excellent unit and easily installed
B000C8NTJE|5|Good replacement part. Fit perfect on my gm 3.1 liter
B00MFSR6Q6|5|Worked well!
B002G29LLE|5|Good
B001INL9JE|1|Sticker did not come off the clear sheet which ruined the sticker. Vary good design tho. Would not recommend unless you plan on not sticking it on something.
B007G2KIDE|5|very good buy, great size & price, on my second summer, just rinse it off in driveway.
B00N2K6M2A|4|Works well being the only bluetooth decice connected to your phone if you have your stereo and adapter you can get it to work with both but its a constant struggle.
B00WE6BHUK|2|They came with lint/dirt underneath the sticker.
B00KTHWNL8|2|This key works with cars sold in a particular region only. I ended up loosing money.
B004BTIAOO|5|Works well in my 88 chevy 4.3
B00SMX8IA6|5|Excellent
B002AMAXNA|5|They arrived as promised, and hopefully we'll never have to use them.
B00G0OMSUA|5|Perfect fit. Got it quick.
B000FRLO9Y|5|Excellent charger and battery maintainer.
B00N25H7B0|5|very simple to install with instructions provided.
B000CIHNLO|5|great sevice
B00VLERCUK|5|Beautiful license plate frame.  Very feminine.  Nice touch to car and very easy to install.
B00O72RVO0|1|Shape and size was really off for my 2008 Mazda CX7. Parts and materials were sub-standard. Documentation/Installation instruction was very vague and therefore useless.
B001AIZ5HY|5|not a bad produce
B00VMBO336|5|easy install and works without issue, what more can you ask for?
B00TEF4ZZI|5|love it
B00G4CT0TU|5|It was as expected
B002N5W8Q4|1|This item is a piece of junk!  I installed the batteries and it would not work.  I ended up taking the batteries out and putting them back in several times and the unit only came on one time and ran for a minute or two and stopped again.  IT IS A MADE IN CHINA PIECE OF JUNK!  DON'T BUY IT.
B001B80CX0|1|This product stinks. After drilling holes in my bed for installation, I learned it cannot handle even 50 lbs let alone the 75 it is rated for. If you plan on using your truck for anything, I would not get this product.
B0006JLW3Y|5|WORKED GREAT
B003F1M3Q0|4|These work well.  Lose stickiness after a couple applications.
B001HKZHIW|5|The waste pump works precisely as advertised.  It easily pumps material from my black tank through a 50' 3/4&#34; hose.  I can't speak to the durability of the product, however, it appears to be a quality product and well worth the price.
B00HB0WUB4|5|its here  a toilet treatment for rv's that really works
B002UCYRZU|5|Used as directed, it polished out yellowed scratched headlights and my shaving mirror better than expected.  Be patient and dedicated.
B00XK8NON4|5|Perfect fit, and articles now stay put, rather than sliding around on the OEM tray.
B00N58VRYC|4|Applied to my 20+ year old track car Miata. Used in the fuel tank, in the engine oil during an oil change and in the intake manifold. Engine did seem to run more smoothly with less splutter on tick over following application. Not 100% sure which method was best use but would certainly use again if experiencing rough idle issue.
B0071EEBWQ|5|Good quality fast ship
B004PHMLOC|4|Works great
B0097CE2NS|5|had to be the quickest ship ever! Worked like a charm and comes with battery
B00HFAHYDY|5|Very funny 😄 !!!!
B00GNHPLAS|5|good product very fast shipping
B00436O8BO|4|For the price you can't beat it.  Have about 10K miles on it with no issues.
B005PWP396|5|This battery fit perfectly in a Honda 750 Nighthawk.  This is an economic choice for a maintenance-free battery.
B005H12QXG|5|Perfect fit for replacing factory mirrors!  No problem and easy to install.  Found You Tube on how to remove old mirrors and install.
B00KQ81M94|4|I have only used it once, but it worked!  Just bought a black vehicle which is impossible to keep clean.  I washed it and wiped it down with the Man Sham and there were no water spots.
B00UVX85X0|5|aaa
B005MZZW5Q|5|Fits perfectly. Very durable, I will be buying more
B008FUOOZY|5|item was exactly as described!
B00DBEM7HG|2|Not as bright as a standard bulb.
B00XWZC5GW|1|Connectors loose on coil pack. Harness won't fully clip on connection. Still getting po300 code multiple/random misfire
B001O07PG2|5|Top quality product<br /><br />20 feet was enough to plumb an average sized coupe, with a little bit left over.<br /><br />Summit fittings worked great with this line<br /><br />no guideline in the protective cover like the older stock.
B00YRZUMR0|5|Great product. I was very very surprised at the qaulity. I bought them as a second set for when I do off roading, and are near as good as the OEM ones but 1/10 th the price.
B0053P69IO|5|This hitch was great and in excellent condition on arrival. I installed this on a 2013 Toyota Sienna XLE within 30 minutes. My brother-in-law and I put the rear of the van on jack stands, cut the underpanel according to the instructions and bolted this in to the pre-drilled holes. Super simple. I then used it to tow a small trailer from Indiana to North Carolina with zero problems.
B0018JXIXI|5|Worked perfectly for what I needed.
B00INZ65B2|5|Simple repair...well worth it.
B00I90IWOY|5|Fit 2013 Altima.
B00DBENCZC|5|its awesome easy to install on 2008 honda civic ex COUPe the only hard time it gives me is pulling the factory light so hard to take it off but after that its easy just pop it back in to the socket and boom its all install
B00H4PFMRU|5|good fit , wish I had bought this years ago when I first installed my winch
B005EV208K|5|Awesome fit on my 550I...
B0000CBIK5|5|Perfect.  We didn't have a ball pump before and this is great.  Don't forget to buy the needles if you need to pump balls, they are not included.
B007SG7X9A|1|It does not fit Jetta 2002, The reverse is like a japanese car, look the picture
B0049HSNPO|5|Great price. Great vendor. NO COMPLAINTS HERE!
B00T89J4LU|5|Fast shipping! Great product!
B0094JKMII|5|easy to install, been using for 6-8 months with no issues, holds my canoe just fine
B00KJGKZTQ|3|The plastic around the keyhole has chipped and just waiting to see how long before it will break and no longer be able to attach to my keyring. It worked perfect other than that.
B00DWKYED4|5|Fast shipping and great product!
B009UZUN9E|4|Just like the factory part
B000TCCWCS|5|It was too cute and a nice thick rubber. Loved it
B00K3M232I|5|This was a fun gift from my daughter to my husband for Father's Day and he loved it.  He has a Vespa and he attached it to the porch rail, right where he parks his beloved scooter.  It is a good quality plastic and has survived rain and wind in our beach community.
B00199EVV0|5|almost half as much as the dealer wanted for just the part. worked great and now the wipers don't have a mind of their own
B004X96DPA|4|as described
B0028QVNGO|4|I like them. They do ride on my nose funny but that is probably my fault for having a strange shaped face.
B003CJQRDU|5|These bandannas are very nice.  They are much prettier than what you would find at the your average, brick and mortar retailer.
B000BVRZ74|5|Worked better than expected
B000CSEUPG|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B000RN4FK6|1|Edit/update: Company responded to my negative review to offer a full replacement, and when I contacted them about it, they chose not to follow through. Really bad business practice on their part. I ordered this item for my motorcycle, a Suzuki TU250, a few months ago, and had a mechanic relocate my signals(welded them on farther back on the bike) and put them on in one go. They never quite sat right(both kind of collapsing inward, rubbing against my tires in turns, etc.) Today, I took my seats off and removed the saddlebags to find out what the problem was. The buckles that are supposed to attach underneath are male on all sides--the mechanic used strictly the velcro straps underneath my passenger seat, versus over it as shown in the photos. I blame cruddy quality control, and now the return window has closed, so... I'm very unhappy with this product.
B000CMF38K|5|Just what I wanted.
B009LZU38Y|1|product was already open inside the box. after installing it the cables grind when I lower or lift my window . not happy with the product at all.
B00MP66JC0|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B004XEQMLU|5|Great
B00FBKSDDA|5|Great quality, easy install. Helpful if they send the installation video sooner.
B001EY2RL6|5|Saves me from getting prescription sunglasses. Work great!
B000CGM1D6|5|Great product!
B00FYX21SM|5|Fit my 2015 Nissan Altima trunk with no problem.
B000AL8VD2|5|Great value.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fit our Ford F250 Superduty with a bit of room to spare! WORKS GREAT!
B00A74CDRW|3|Great fit. Air vents will not stay open
B00HG2UEBA|5|Great for our truck.  It makes it so easy to climb into the bed of the truck.
B002P8D5SY|5|Fit perfectly and shipped fast
B000C9D9EI|5|Received as stated.  Good product
B002SB04CS|5|Nice fit.  Handles water and dirt well.
B002CYYCYM|5|Looks great!
B00LTX840A|4|Works Great!
B00EQ9NHME|5|Used it on a 3600 mile trip, and it worked awesome!
B0068FYF20|5|Exactly what I needed to replace my battery in my Yamaha VSTAR!
B000H3TUE2|5|Better than most bulbs Ive used. Not sure how long it will last but looks good so far.
B008X6QS90|2|Leds work....but came unlabeled and in a jumbled mess together in one pouch. I must now individually test every single led in order to find out what color the strip of leds is. Pain in the ass
B00JFWKM2K|4|The product works as advertised, but it is large and bulky, and the bright yellow color says &#34;Steal Me Now, Please!&#34; In short, it prompted me to buy a padlock for the power hookup...
B0073I3XM4|2|Ring attachment broke off within 2 months of usage. Not a durable product.
B000SL0R9K|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B000RFSLY0|5|Not only did I get a new &#34;funnel&#34; but an extra length of piping to get the receiver closer to the drain plug and minimize the sloppage. (Trust me it is a real word - almost!)
B005K01GSA|5|The delivery was on time and the seat belt works very well.  I am a  pleased customer.<br />Thanks Daniel Mangine
B00GNTHTJM|1|Ordered the pair, first one &#34;smoked&#34; after about 30 seconds and took out the 10 amp fuse.  Will not try the second one.  NOT RECOMMENDED!
B00QAMKNYK|5|Awesome!
B00C4H2YXI|5|Used these on a 2000 Silverado.  Perfect fit.  Everything is back in place as it should be.
B00FYX204C|5|Easy trim to fit, looks great in my 2015 Equinox!
B004MSYQBU|4|Pretty nice, but I'd probably get a whole stand if I had to do it over.
B00KTIYXLU|5|as advertised
B003A1FJKW|5|Parts got here really fast,,the chrome  looked  HI quality.put parts on my  car and they fit as good as the Original Parts did,,,Really happy with the price and Quality  THANKS
B0058ECUQ0|5|Nice tool for me
B0068M354C|5|Perfect!  Original OEM plugs had 75K miles and they were due.
B003Y7TEFI|5|This was really nice for my child's dot approved helmet.
B00MD3EXEG|3|These have potential.  However, I had a couple issues.  First, these apparently must be taped on the car's paint unlike other brands for other cars.  This should be in the description.  Frankly, I wouldn't have purchased them had I known.  This lead to confusion upon install as well.  Instructions (unincluded) would have cleared that up.  Otherwise they're well constructed and look nice!
B00XA2SO6C|5|Great shipping, price, and Great quality, works perfect on my Harley Davidson Electra air shock
B003UXZ6RG|5|Love this, looks and feels great, and goes with the interior of my car perfectly. The people complaining that it doesn't fit their go kart sized steering wheel... well maybe you should have thought of that and looked at the measurements of what size steering wheel it will fit?? Fit my 05 hyndai perfectly.
B010NY60WO|1|It didn't even fix the  threads  it made it like half a turn and then just started cross threading
B000FW7VXW|5|good deal
B0015D19SS|5|Very easy to use. Held up perfectly for our trip, we used it for a paddleboard that weighed 47lbs. Didn't budge the whole 5 hour trip, at highway speeds.
B005C91436|4|a fairly decently priced replacement. the mirror is slightly warped but it does the job
B0066TMKTI|5|Awesome quality at the right price...only way I can drive a 20 year old BMW! Thanks URO!
B007Y87YZU|5|On time delivery, it was the perfect fit for my 1998 Nissan Frontier work perfect......and it also save me a lot of money I would recommend this product to anyone wants to buy.
B00R1QTUIY|5|Glad I finally found the product that comes on a new motorcycle chain from the factory / dealer.  This stuff is the best.  I tried it on my bicycle chain and I can feel the difference vs. a high end wax or oil.  This will go on all my bikes (moto and pedal) from now on.
B00WM36XNG|5|I ordered this because I desperately needed something to help me keep my car clean! I was skeptical, but have to say that it arrived today and is EXACTLY what I have been looking for! Very well made!! Would highly recommend to anyone!
B0026NB0YO|5|Perfect Fit
B004L5R8IC|5|Thank you !!
B004A6BHA2|5|Fixed misfire and poor idle on 2001 mustang, great product!
B000N9V8Q8|5|easy install
B00F670NPO|5|Installed with easy.  Save a bunch of money by not having to go to the dealer.  Door works like brand new again.
B00SH33SVU|5|does the job, white/blue light instead of yellow
B00MQAG0TM|5|Just as expected. Looks great, high quality. Product arrived quickly and well packaged.
B00AQZBGIY|5|The best since sliced bread!!
B0044GHGBM|5|works fine
B000FGE8E8|5|Great air filter! very easy installation. Quick and simple way to gain power and better fuel economy. I can tell it accelerates faster than stock also better throttle response.
B006TXDNK6|1|Hated this! Didn't fit right...kept coming off. Wouldn't suggest for anyone .
B000CMKESO|5|Looks great on my FX4
B00317420I|1|I got it but I wanted a clutch not a front brake, 20$ down the trash can
B005GLQCKA|3|Very quick and convenient, well worth it if you do a lot of brake jobs. Not made for sticky pistons, though; I snapped the aluminum frame with my hands on one caliper. It's worth it to me to buy another one.
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Love it! Looks great on my fz-07 and slim enough. You can definitely fit a couple shirts,pants and a thin sweater or jacket.
B0081KM6Q2|5|One of many i have bought...great light
B000CITTW0|5|Great thanks
B00GAVFFRQ|5|After a few weeks of researching I finally coughed up the money and bought one of these. Do yourself a favor and purchase this helmet along with some Alpine ear plugs (should ride with hearing protection anyway), hook your Sena bluetooth up and enjoy riding like never before. I usually never go out and just ride to ride, but tonight I did for the first time. The earplugs cut down, and almost out any substantial wind noise, while allowing you to listen to your tunes clearly. I was doing 80mph and could hear my music just fine, calls as well. Calls are actually louder. I have to turn my headset down a bit, even at highway speeds.
B0030EVL60|4|Too much thread tape as all their products I've purchased. Had to disassemble and re-tape to get the tape into the threads where it belongs. Otherwise a good product.
B00FRHOMNM|5|Good product.
B00U7FV5HU|2|One bulb worked great! The other bulb worked until i closed the hood.... Hasn't worked since.....
B007U9EXVQ|5|I've had these guys on my car for a week or so now, I love them. I just hope they last!
B008I17HXG|5|received the part quickly,good quality and was easy  to install.looks great!
B000CMHVJO|5|does exactly whats intended to!<br />took a little tinkering to get it to fit right so that I could close the tail gate but its worth the trouble in the end.<br />no more stressing out to close it and now I can close my tail gate with one finger if I wish to.
B00FZN528C|2|Described to fit my 2010 Mazda. It does not.
B000WJIZOC|5|Works great!
B00HDMEUCW|2|I also have an issue with the rubber backing. The seat cover fabric I ordered is black, the backing is white. The backing flakes off onto the top of the seat cover. I couldn't figure out what the white specks were on the floor and the seat cover, until I noticed when my husband entered the car, the seat cover flipped up against his leg (the part that hangs over the side). Looks like seat cover dandruff :( After a washing it seems ok but the flakes begin all over again. I think I will just use a beach towel or order neoprene covers.  September 6, 2015 - I was pleasantly surprised when a package arrived from Happeseat! I received two new seat covers with a letter explaining 1% of their clients had issues with the backing flaking off. They truly have integrity to do this :)  The new covers are on and time will tell if these are the improved version. I will certainly give them 5 stars for customer service but will wait a bit for 5 star item rating.
B000I1R27K|5|Great product, very happy with it
B0032ADXNG|1|One of the three metal pieces that the fiberglass poles fit into broke, another is near breaking. We thought we may have to sleep under the stars and pray it didn't rain but, we managed to hold the tent together with duct tape. The fiberglass poles are also poor quality. One of the poles splintered. The kind person helping us set up our tent ended up with a deep fiberglass splinter.
B00EP61WLG|5|Great stuff
B00I88AB8M|5|works great as of now,,  easy to install, the instructions were kind of crap, but they do work.  Dont listen to the reset button instructions not sure what that was about if you have a 15 + zx 6r it fits and works great right out of the box !! its brite and flashes signals like its supposed to  highly recommend it !!
B00QURNR3E|5|prevent things from falling, also holds chargers and phone
B000E7SY02|4|The bike carrier is sturdy and well made.  It fits perfectly behind out sport utility.  My only concern is that it appears the rack was possibly purchased and returned by another customer.  The paint is scratched in several places an there's about a 4 inch gouge on the main shaft.  We decided to keep it because the price was extremely reasonable and the defects did not jeopardize the strength or function of the rack.
B00080QHMM|5|Unbelievable accurate and easy to use.  I wish I had purchased one of these a long time ago.
B00KQPLH8S|5|Really helps when carrying long objects. Very glad I ordered it. Found it very necessary when hauling a 2 person 14 ft. kayak.
B00OBQUXU6|5|Easy install, fits perfectly. Very satisfied.
B00BCRMAR6|4|I was very happy to receive my new seat covers today. These are to replace the old seat covers that i had on in my car since I got it.<br /><br />First of all, this set comes with a lot of stuff. I have priced seat covers before and most of them cost a lot more than this set and come with a lot less.  It comes with two bucket seat covers. The top is separate from the bottom so the seat will fold easily.  It comes with a full back seat cover. Again, the top is separate from the bottom. It has 5 head rest covers. There are 4 seat belt pads, and one steering wheel cover. It comes in a plastic zipper bag. it also has a bag full of eye hooks so you can tighten your seat covers.<br /><br />I personally only wanted it for the front seat covers and the steering wheel cover. I have a two fold seat in the back that is oddly shaped. So I ended up using the front seat covers, the four seat belt pads, and the steering wheel cover. I also used the head rest pads on the front and back.<br /><br />The material is a bit thin.  Looks well made but thin. The plus is that it should help keep things cool in the Florida heat. The negative is that it would not really help protect against drink spills. Overall, it should do a decent job of protecting against other things.<br /><br />I must say I did not really care for the instructions.  I found them to be confusing. The good news is when you start putting everything together it is fairly straight forward. I mostly just tied the elastic tie down ends to each other in the back. I also used several of the eye hooks and tried to find places under the seat to hook them.  This way I was able to get a better fit.<br /><br />I really like the color of the seat covers.  The green against the black really looks sporty. The steering wheel cover looks cool and has a very snug fit.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with them.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B00HAOY8IO|5|Great fit. Good product.
B00EZBSBM4|1|I've had it for 5 months and the wire harness has burnt up. Very irritated.
B006G4HRRI|1|Do not buy this unless you only want to use for small tires, bikes, float tubes etc. Bought this, waited 2 months to use on RV tire, would not inflate. Called Amazon, their supply would not issue credit, even after Wilmar agreed it did not work correctly. The compressor failed when I needed it, had to buy another compressor to get my tires aired up.
B0029TQDLA|4|I've only had the holders for a couple of weeks. They are sturdy and do what is needed. It was good value for the price and having a second holder is great, as long as I remember where to store it.
B00BGG8L30|5|Great navigation system. Easy install. A little pricey but worth the money
B006X6OSJ4|5|Easily installed on my 2013 F-250. Two thumbs up..
B00MWNZ4XQ|3|They just don't seem to sit right across the entire length of the blade.
B000CRVFYQ|5|Good but it was EXTREMELY hard to get in the valve cover. Had to use a rubber mallet to get the pcv valve inside
B00TEP5E62|2|We are unable to use any of these cup holder devices in our car. Just won't fit anywhere. Just an ordinary used Cadillac sedan ,not sure what's wrong. Should send them back,just haven't yet.
B00OJYX096|2|not as shown
B0037R8F8W|1|2011 Honda odyssey has had these on for about 1.5mos now and they have started to squeal very loudly when taking off from slow speeds such as backing out of parking spots. I completely replaced rotors and everything when I replaced so its definitely the pads. front and rears both do it.
B00I2I104C|4|Better quality LED's than I've purchased at other locations, like superbrightleds.  However, on a two door wrangler you'll be paying for two LED's in the package that aren't needed.
B00G59CE72|5|Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.
B00BFDIPF8|5|shipped earlier than expected and the A/C Clutch coil fit my Honda 2006 civic perfect.  I would buy again
B000NSJ9HY|4|FYI these are knurled. Seem to be built well. Time will tell.
B00K72C1T4|1|Died after only using twice!!!! Don't Buy!!!
B004PXAUGC|5|Work as should.
B0050C5GWU|5|I had no idea what a chore it can be to recover a seat - but with Hydro-Turf, it was already form-fitted to my seat.  Whoever recovered my seat last time, did not have this luxury.  I would highly recommend this cover.  I used it on my seat and cowl--- both look and feel great!  The stitching is a bonus.  Previously I replaced the seat with a used seat --- only to have the same splitz in the material happy with &#34;old/unfitted&#34; vinyl.  Now, I have something I am proud of... thanks!
B0011NMVLG|5|They are lug nut covers exactly like the ones that came on the truck.
B000VKRQ7O|5|My local oil change place wanted $39.99 for this filter... $39.99!<br /><br />Ordered it here and within a few minutes I had the new filter installed and saved a ton of money.
B0073XOMTC|3|I've had the antenna installed for 10 days on my 2011 Mini Countryman.  That has been long enough to confirm that it DOES affect satellite radio service. It fits fine and has a clean profile on the car.  But in a downtown setting the antenna is affected by the buildings.  In the suburbs, driving street lined with mature trees the signal is also inconsistent.  It also has random signal hiccups on the open freeway.  This just doesn't come close to the factory antenna.  I expect to return it and get the Mini factory stubby.
B000R5OIB0|5|Bought these for a friend he said they were awesome!!!!!
B001PVSKTG|4|This fitted my 2014 F-150 XLT Crew Cab perfectly, and looks great, however is slightly over priced for being chrome plated plastic.
B00Q0BN91K|5|Very nice. MIne did come with good directions WITH pictures too!!  Secures with velcro straps that wrap around frame as pictured.  It is very secure with no rattles.  As another indicated, if you plan to use doors, make sure this will not impede the door mounting or operation.  Glass is heavy and very clear. I hope it is scratch resistant as stated.  Gasket needs installed and cut at each mounting point since the mounts need to be against the glass to fit nicely.  I like it...5 stars.
B0092KVYGI|5|I put this into my aux. socket on my golf cart to monitor the battery and charging system.  It works great.  Just sitting it reads about 12.2 Volts and while running jumps to 13.6 -14.3 volts. The only problem I see is that it could use a switch to turn it off and on, but you can always just unplug it.  I'm going to buy several more to put in my vehicles and boats.
B00B5X68NY|1|I just received these, and I was expecting them to be adult sized, I dont know what size your model is, but &#34;midget&#34; sounds about right.
B000KKND3Q|5|Worked for me
B00TQPS1YC|5|Compact, inexpensive, and works well.
B000C0UP3K|5|didn't have to cut hose for my 02 Buick century like other had stated.
B001AIT9AI|3|...i installed this in a honda ridgeline...the product installation on the tailgate was fairly simple, although i had to google how to remove the panels and access the tailgate latch mechanism...also, running the wire along the factory harness required me to basically take apart half the interior of the vehicle including the rear seats...all in all took me around 6 hours...<br /><br />...the instructions were not great...the pictures were useless, but luckily i found a pdf version online in which i could zoom in which worked fine...<br /><br />...i noticed there is a small spring that was bent when i received it and had to carefully unbend...the lock worked the first few times i used it, but then stopped engaging and so wasn't locking the tailgate...i reopened the panels on the tailgate and realized it was the small spring and had to modify it some...now it works every time, although it wasn't so cut and dry and as well put together upon receiving it as i hoped...<br /><br />...if it weren't for the small spring, i probably would have given it at least 4 stars...
B003WC4G26|5|I purchased this for a friend 's birthday. She loves Grell so i had to get it. I think she is going to love it! (especially since i want one now too :p) I am going to have to buy it again for myself!
B005DNJPSC|5|Great little tool to have. Does its job.
B008Y1ZE1C|5|No issues, works well with my 250 Rebel
B00R3QW6KG|5|Fast shipping<br />Got it in a tube,so I got it not ripped.Love ❤ the color.I put it down my hood  so it would cover up a bad scratch on car.It worked perfectly.
B00YBHKIFK|3|The only problem I have with these is fit. They don't seem to fit comfortably when I wear them.
B000YOQURE|5|Great little sander slightly heavier than snap on but not too much so
B00NWS2Z5K|5|Exactly as advertised, well constructed and perfect fit for my 2015 Toyota Camry SE.
B00KY8QGLA|5|This product suprised me with how well it is made...very happy with this replacement part.
B005JZQCJE|5|My friend and breast cancer survivor loved them.These are nice even if they were blank.My Wife died from this dreaded curse,it help's me keep her memory alive buying stuff like this.So glad they were available.
B00HS82FLE|4|It's a well made cute bumper. However, the colors are not as vivid as shown on the picture. The little pink bird is not a dark pink it's a very light shade of pink. I wanted to be darker so I'm a little disappointed. Other than that I think it's a nice addition to the nursery.
B0015PN010|5|Excelent
B00BTLEIIY|5|great sevice
B00KQNVD4S|5|The key fit an worked like charm thanks amaxon
B004EIAADG|4|This was exactly what I was looking for. Something I can use to inflate my electric air mattress and power the tent fan so I can avoid buying 8 D batteries. I also bought rechargeable headlights and tent lights. To top it off, I inflated my son's bike tires. Great product. I would've given it 5 stars if the air inflator/deflator worked faster. It's pretty slow but overall very happy. It used apps 75% of the charge after 3 days of use.
B00G2TV7OG|2|These would turn on and blink, but they would blink fast just the way the car did when the factory build was burnt out. This happened on two vehicles. The vehicles can't detect the new bulls is there, so it still thinks the light is out or blown.
B002PQOI32|5|Fit perfectly and came with bulbs.
B002BQJC0K|5|order size up
B000BUOSGG|4|Glad that i was actually able to find dish drainer that does not take too much space, especially since i live in small apartment with small kitchen. The only downside is it can get cramped to drain a lot of plates or things at once but other than that i'm pretty pleased.
B002BG4WX2|3|Well, it worked for a short while.  I used this on my A/C and worked--the air in the car was as cool as it every was.  Two months later, the air coming from the vents is 'maybe' a couple degrees colder than the 85 degree outside air, but not enough to leave the windows closed and use the A/C.  It is certainly not a permanent fix.  (BTW:  following the instructions.  The can needs to be in a certain orientation to dispense the contents.)
B00SCG9TD8|5|Super bright white!
B004ZF39T0|5|Works great, shipment on time
B00VNBEJ1G|5|Great design, and so far they are working perfectly.
B00EBEV4OW|1|I purchased the fridge in March, 2015.  It arrived on time in a retail box.  It came with everything advertised.  My only concern was the door handle, it was made of plastic and didn't feel very sturdy.  It worked close to as advertised, cooling things inside. It never made things cold, but cool.  I would keep it full of items in order to keep it cool when opening the door.  I used it to keep medicine cool in my bedroom. As of August 21, 2015, my worries were realized.  I heard a &#34;Pop&#34; and the door latch broke.  Some internal lock part broke and the door won't close.  I called the seller, Best Choice Products, and it was out of there system and out of warranty.  They offered me the same fridge for $49.95 plus an extra 10% off.  Why would I spend $45.00 more for something that lasted only 5 months.  I opened the door approximately 6 to 8 times a day and never mishandled it.  I would not recommend it.
B0033YJBH8|2|Do not use silicone sealant to seal this well nut in place, the silicone will make it slippery and the well nut will have a tendency to pull out of the hole you placed it in. The brass threaded insert will also pull out if tighten too much.
B003ASFUZE|5|Quality product. Should last a lifetime.
B0002SQVDK|5|Good product, as advertised.
B00HLV06YQ|3|Good helmet
B00MA4OADM|5|Easy to install. looks great.  well made
B004AOMCO4|5|Product arrived at the correct location and was in one piece, with no damage whatsoever!<br /><br />The material is a bit rubbery and quite honestly its good that it is, making it less likely to jab at me when it's in my pocket. The colour of it is a bit better than he actual image itself is. Was larger than anticipated as well!<br /><br />Sidenote: if you buy from this sender, give it some time to arrive. Mine was a week later than expected, but the product's high quality evened it out. Would recommend you order it ahead of time if you plan on it being a gift. Would consider even buying another for a friend if they wanted one.
B00V0UFTR8|5|Great product...Delivered faster than stated.
B00AA7LD5E|1|This was not the correct part. It did not cross correctly from the OEM part number.

B005KVLX50|5|worked great, ,sturdy, takes apart easily to be stored
B00RL21EFK|3|76 Yamaha Exciter 34 tunnel rails rub the black side walls and had to drill a lower hole as it did not quite reach it on factory holes.
B0054RAKD6|4|Very glad I bought this... it is darker then it look in the image! Fits great
B0024E6ZW2|5|Under the camper step. Easy to adjust. stays put and stops the 'saddle stirrup' effect.
B000FIY08U|1|Would not provide enough power to run a small tire pump of the exact type featured on the box the power converter was received in.
B001P2JONQ|5|Clever little product. Works great, seems durable. I would recommend.
B000IY80ZU|2|Perfect OEM fit, quickly warped over 1500 miles.
B00XXLZ2O2|4|Soft and thick towels, easy to wash and clean! towels are as soft on the 4th light bleach wash as they were when I first received them. Bright white color, no funny smell (like some other detailing towels). NO LINT left behind from either uses! Used a little white vinegar to clean my electronic screens, and there was no issue. Great for cleaning and drying items. Cant wait to use these to actually detail and wash my car!! Please note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
B003VAX3IC|4|Works great.
B00BGC6KJ6|5|Works as advertised.

B000GV91FS|5|Everything needed and excellent quality, what else needs to be said! I really recommend this product!
B00C2SXD20|5|Perfect fit for 2013 ford f150. Great price
B002P8T2PO|3|I made sure this would fit, and it does, but it doesn't fit quite right. It's got a little knob to adjust it, instead of having to move the actual mirror. The problem is the part that goes on the inside of the car, the panel to cover the metal part of the car, where it's attached, does not work/fit over the knob. It was easy to put on, I just had to take two stars off for not being able to make it look fully installed.
B007J8IKFI|1|I will not give stars!!<br /> comes not serrated!!<br />I can't believe it..<br />Wasted my money and time!!<br />I refund it

B0036VQUOA|1|This Product has taken a Deep Scratch into an a Mess ...My Deep Scratch looked better.....As Stated if you have a Black car it may be better but the fine sanding still shows after polishing and waxing ..........THIS IS CRAP !!!!<br /><br />I tried to everything right before trying this product knowing I had a deep scratch ......Well I tried it anyway and what a mistake. The video on You Tube shows a Black Car which hides the fact that the light sanding leaves a dull finish no matter how you polish/wax it. This product took a deep scratch on my car and now turned it into an eye sore .........My feeling : PLEASE DON'T WASTE  YOUR MONEY !!!
B007HD7MV8|3|Worked as expected
B001HATY36|4|I like the keyed alike feature of these and they are very sturdy locks.
B00JJP2K82|5|Thanks for the fast shipping from Greece and I wear this proudly on my MC
B00BWNSCJA|3|Decent fitment, had to remove 2 pins to use factory bolts.. passenger side light has defect, inner red lens rotated to wrong angle.. but for less than half price I didn't have high hopes. But looks better than stock
B0085L4GW4|5|Received this product sooner than expected. Very glad I ordered it. After 10 years I had to replace my gas tank cap for my Volvo S40. This product is easy to install. Fit and function is perfect.
B000CSKMJ4|5|Great service, was just what I was looking for
B000VMF426|5|I LOVE it. Great quality, heavy duty, installs easily and fits my 16&#34; wheels perfectly. Advice: Install from the bottom up :)
B000C2GH12|5|The quality of these gaskets were higher than I expected. Then the install went easily into my 1984 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ60 2F engine.
B0060HVCHW|5|nice formula
B008SGTAUO|5|I purchased this Cat for my 2006 Toyota Prius (with 180k miles), I am very satisfied thus far. The Check Engine Light is off and the car drives well. I've had it in for about one (1) month now and its all good.... I had a local muffler shop install if for me and they charged me $120, that included them welding it in.  Sure beets the dealer at about $1,600.  My car now has a little over 190k miles and its running great! Do to my experience with this catalytic converter I would recommend it.
B00T7GYDTC|5|These are great lights. The packaging and shipping are without fault.
B00Y9JWD26|5|Well, I have not driven more of 100 kms...<br />My car is a honda Accord v6 2009<br />But, I can say:<br />I feel the accelerator of my car better, faster.<br />The engine feels more dynamic and it sounds great.<br />The fuel economy I do not have data yet, but I guess less using accelerator, at the end there will be less consumption.<br /><br />Finally the investment is really minimal for the benefits received.
B0032HBXJ0|5|Best tonneau cover I could of imagined.  I live in Washington and I need it to protect from rain but not everyday, and it is easy enough to take it off or put it on a couple times a week if needed.
B00VX8I7GM|5|as advertised
B00QCDWVMY|4|No pega bien
B00KUI13C6|5|Great product!

B009AJJKX0|5|Great quality!
B00691Z4QY|3|it is OK!
B004M95W5S|4|I replaced a cover just like this one. I made my own tie-down for it as the string that came with it would in now way be sufficient for as long as the cover lasts. It's the same as you would find on a hoodie sweatshirt, not suitable for the weather exposure that this will see.
B0031P08DU|5|Works as advertised.  Easy fix for my broken Atwood hot water heater!
B002YKQNL4|3|This is not an offican Toyota Decal. I tried to be careful when applying but the decal ripped on the &#34;R&#34;. It wasn't bad and I still used the decal. Delevery was quicker than expected.
B00CUO2BXS|4|I used it on my trike ,It took almost all the wobble out. It was pain in the ass to install , but I managed to get most of one bag in the front tire.  I think that you should tell people that with the bead's that you receive the installation bottles. It cost more to send the separate bottle  . I think that I should receive a refund for this from Amazon . John Nicolosi
B00BSO3JK0|2|I brought two of these keys to replace my old keys.  One worked until I pulled out the actual key to see how that worked and it broke the inside of the key.  So now I'm scared to pull out my actual key to one that is working.
B006ISY3J2|5|You cant beat the price. I installed this on my 2002 infinity that had a check engine light. Its been a few months and no check engine light. Be very careful removing the bolts as they are allen. I stripped one trying to remove it and had to get a set of replacement bolts.
B00BTLEIIY|5|It was a bit difficult for me to put the seat covers on but after i took the time it all looked really good.
B00VXFNIAU|1|Was wrong ítem, I am requesting YAMAHA WaveRunner Cover - Black/Charcoal OEM # MWV-CVRVX-CR-15 (New), and I recived MWV-UNICV-XL-BL
B000E28EH0|4|We'll see if it works well enough to justify the installation. I started with the 2&#34; wide but found it has a hard time not buckling on the curves of the exhaust so switched to 1&#34; on the second pipe. Also, I did not like the fit or use of the steel zip ties. When you tighten them it twists the wrap. The hose clamps are much easier to use and are more secure. I painted my wrap with the silicone high temp paint before installation and I wrapped my exhaust installed. I had problems getting the exhaust off so just kept it on. I do recommend some wetting to get the wrap tight. It does leach black either from the wrap or paint. The reason for 4 stars is the wrap unravels really easily. Wherever you cut it the threads start coming apart. Wetting helps keep it together while you wrap. I have pics of the wrap and with the zip ties and hose clamps. I removed most of the ties and replaced them with the hose clamps. You can just measure the diameter of the pipe and buy a few hose clamps in that size. I have also included a pic of the smoking on initial burn off after installation. There was still a fair amount of heat felt but I'm hoping there will be less chance of burns if there is any accidental exposure on the ATV.
B000AS3D3S|5|This is an exact replacement for my 2003 Lincoln Navigator with 5.4 engine. You can't beat the price and it's a Motorcraft !!
B00062ZY3K|5|A very good product by K & N, the only problem is knowing the correct size to get for the filter you have, Amazon does not always have the correct size or the model number, so be sure to get the right information before ordering, I called K&N to get the right model number.
B005NLQAHS|5|Outstanding! Solved my intermittent &#34;check engine light.&#34;
B00ZV9XC9G|5|This saved me over $100 with this $5 fix! Thank you, thank you! And it came so fast.
B00P2D3VZG|5|Great bulbs I would say they are about 5500K closer to pure white have these installed on my '07 CBR and on my '14 Accords tailights
B008QXZ5MQ|5|Fits perfect
B000BQUEWC|1|Barely fits on the visor of a 2011 F150.  Feels like it isn't going to last long.
B004M2JZUS|4|I love the look, but the glue that came with it did not hold. After a few weeks, the left grip came loose and I had to buy some Locktite glue which has held for about 4 weeks so far.
B004TC3D18|5|Hid the scratches on my roof.  It's a little shinier than the original paint but much better than the white from the scratches.  Easy to use.
B000IYNU3M|5|Installed this in my 2000 Nissan Xterra. Fits just as good as the original and smaller one.
B007Q8JUVY|5|Now I can transfer my State Park sticker.
B00KWNUGHW|5|This cover was delivered quickly and fits perfect. I read the instructions and had it on in 15 minutes with no tools. Looks great on my truck and you can't beat the price.
B007ZGKKMA|5|It is bright!
B00AB04MTO|4|Great sticker, though the only reason for not giving all 5 stars is that the space between the checkers and the arch is solid white as opposed to clear. Great sticker otherwise.
B00HG2VZ72|5|it is kinda small but I like it
B00418U0AM|5|Quality decal received and applies easily.
B000HTROIK|3|alright

B005N6XIHS|5|I LOVE IT
B004OIEZZU|4|Fixed TPS code issues, replaced in conjuction with throttle body and IAC valve cleaning.  Rough idle and stall conditions eliminated.<br /><br />Works for now, curious as to longevity but not concerned.
B00KM23ZNU|5|Very solid product
B00FY81EN0|5|Fit my 2005 300c perfectly. Have been in about 8 months now and are holding up well. Came with bulbs.
B004GCC86W|5|Great product
B000CPI1UY|5|Worked great on an old motorcycle muffler. I baked on the paint in my gas grill. Multiple coats. Looks great!
B0002NYDRG|3|instruction lousy
B001SD2C0E|2|I've had this cover for about 6 months now. At one point it kept everything nice and dry but that changed 3.5 months after the summer heat rolled in. The front and rear weatherstripping (pretty critical parts) began to separate from the cover. I lifted the rear cover and about 1/2 the stripping was just dangling off. I never remove the cover so the front stay down against the truck so it took me a bit to notice that the front weatherstripping had also separated from the front of the cover. The side stripping seems to be fine because it sits in a groove while the front and rear is just adhered to the cover with adhesive that appears to not handle heat well. It's a black cover so the surface can heat up to very high temps in the summer sun. I was disappointed in the failure to say the least. I like everything else about the cover but now I have to figure out how to keep the weatherstripping from coming lose from the cover during summer temps. I would have expected the adhesive to withstand pretty high temps since the metal frame is black and it would be sitting in the sun on a vehicle during the summer months.<br /><br />I do like the construction of the product overall and it was easy to install. I have to mark it down significantly because of the weatherstripping failing so soon which defeats the purpose of a cover like this, I didn't expect it to be fully dry in the bed but I did expect it to stay dry enough that the bed liner groves would keep small amount of water below the items in the bed. It did for a few months but with 1/2 the overall weatherstripping failing, that doesn't happen anymore.
B003SS62PS|5|Works great!
B00U6G6GQK|3|fit could have been better, had dents in tube, but no dents in packaging
B000NS7GCO|5|They wanted $300 for this same part at Ford dealership, without labor!  Husband put it in in a snap. I guess it is on top of the motor unit & very accessible .  What surprised us both the most is it was in an actual Ford Motor Company package!
B005HMHTH8|5|These lights make my interior look great compared to the yellow cheap looking stock ones.  At first I thought it woud take awhile getting used to the unusual color, but I love the detailes that now show up with the light that you couldn't see before.  It also gives it a more luxury feel.  I just wish the set came with the bulbs for the glove department and the vanity mirrors.  It actually came with a spare one and I put it in the the trunk.  I will have to order more. Great purchase!
B001GC2LVM|5|Very high quality and they worked well on my 38 foot fifth-wheel.
B0002HRBSU|4|I was doing a custom installation for my CB antenna so I did not want to skimp on the components, which is why I went straight to Firestik for the main mounting stud. This is a high quality piece, threads are cut precise, the whole thing goes together very nice. This matched up oerfectly with the Firestik II antenna I was installing.
B00B51YHI4|5|As others have done, I used 3m auto tape on my 2014 300s.  Perfect paint match, easy install, great look, fast shipping, and inexpensive. Perfect.
B00E1EFX7G|5|Very good quality and easy to mount.
B00I3BPKQ2|5|These are nice break levers I bought them to fix my brakes on my electric bike I'm still getting to it
B001G4Z5NQ|4|I like this rack. It's low profile for a basket and seems strong. However, there are known issues on the web about rust. The rack comes 2 two pieces. If you're lucky, you get the newer version with rubber sleeves for the connecting tubes and rubber washers for the screws. That does help, but you need to do more. I would get a can of Rustoeum truck bed liner spray. It's the same stuff as they use on the outside of the basket.  Spray it inside the tubes to coat it which can help prevent rusting from the inside out, which is the main cause of the rust on these baskets. Then use black outdoor silicone caulk, like the type you'd use on home windows, etc... to seal all screw holes (including the wind deflector)  and the 4 tube seems. Check all welds for any holes/ openings where water may get in. It's a simple easy fix that can save you alot of headache later on.
B00XEH89EK|4|[[VIDEOID:49a1233e3fe6a828c64c6da8bd4609c4]]I've uploaded a video to show an example of the audio quality using it in different modes, so use this to see whether you're happy with the quality it's able to output.  Bare in mind that Amazon has a very low file size restriction, which meant it had to be uploaded in the poorer quality 480p resolution.<br /><br />Also, depending on which device you're using to see this review, the video may not be visible.  I'd recommend viewing on a desktop or laptop.<br /><br />.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.<br /><br />♦ Introduction ♦<br /><br />When it comes to motorcycle gadgets and tech, Sena really have been making great strides when it comes to innovation, firstly by making a device that allows you to overlay your voice to GoPro cameras via Bluetooth; followed by making their very own Bluetooth audio action camera, the Prism. Sena have now stepped the game up even further by making the 10C, an all inclusive action camera and Bluetooth intercom/communication device.<br /><br />Going through the specs of the 10C, it's as if Sena have almost perfectly combined the 20S with the Prism into one package, but look closer or even use it in fact, and you will see it's not exactly the same. Whilst the 10C has gained some extra features like 'Video Tagging' or 'Smart Audio Mix' which are FANTASTIC to have, it has also lost a couple, one that I've clearly noticed is that there's no 'UHD Voice Recording' which unfortunately hinders sound quality when recording your voice. That said, depending on your needs and expectations, the recording quality of the 10C may be absolutely fine.<br /><br />When it comes to weight, the 10C weighs 34g (1.19oz) more than the 20S which weighs 60g (2.11oz), but is only marginly bigger in size, so is still very compact. Also despite the 10C having the extra camera feature, the 10C only has three main buttons and is surprisingly very simple to use. Sena have also given the 10C a \\"cool\\" & \\"unique\\" look which seems to grab other motorcyclists curiosity.<br /><br />- Main Features:<br />∙ Action Cam & Bluetooth communication system/intercom in one device.<br />∙ Full HD 1080p Recording at 30FPS (720P at 60FPS is available).<br />∙ 125°FoV with F/2 aperture.<br />∙ 30° Lens rotation to level out footage.<br />∙ Time-Lapse Feature.<br />∙ 1.6km (1 mile) intercom range (with no obstacles in the way).<br />∙ Up to four-way intercom.<br />∙ Voice prompts (the headset will tell you when a mode is activated, so you're always aware of what's happening).<br />∙ Smart audio mix (Overlay intercom conversations, music, FM radio or phonecalls to your footage).<br />∙ Video tagging.<br />∙ Microphone noise control.<br />∙ Music sharing to other intercoms.<br />∙ FM Radio.<br />∙ Universal Intercom.<br />∙ Use whilst charging.<br />∙ Firmware Upgradable.*<br /><br />There is a firmware upgrade that's already available, so before using the 10C, go to Sena's website and search for their 'Device Manager' which is needed to update the 10C.<br /><br />- Box Contents:<br />∙ Main Headset Unit.<br />∙ Helmet Clamp.<br />∙ Adhesive Mounting Plate.<br />∙ Helmet Speakers.<br />∙ Attachable Boom Mic.<br />∙ Boom Mic Holder.<br />∙ Mic Wind Shields.<br />∙ Wired Mic.<br />∙ USB - Micro USB Cable.<br />∙ Car Charger (Cigarette Port).<br />∙ Pads, Covers and Hook & Loop Fasteners for Speakers & Mics.<br />∙ Allen Wrench.<br />∙ Quick Start Guide.<br /><br />- Recommended Extras:<br />∙ MicroSD Memory Card (The 10C only supports up to 32GB).<br /><br />♦ Helmet Attachment Set-Up ♦<br /><br />- Mount:<br /><br />You have two choices to mount the 10C to your helmet; either by using the helmet clamp or the adhesive plate.<br /><br />I used the helmet clamp as not only does it not leave any residue onto my helmet, it makes the whole mounting and un-mounting a quick and easy process.<br /><br />To attach the helmet clamp, ensurethe clamp is loosened by using the included Allen wrench to undo the bolts; then slide the clamp onto your helmet (the part going inside your helmet should go between the shell and the cushion).<br /><br />After it's slotted in firmly and you're happy with the position, tighten up the bolts so the clamp is fixed in position.<br /><br />If you're using the adhesive plate, ensure the area it's being placed on is cleaned and dried (alcohol wipes are good to use). It's best to leave the adhesive plate on for at least 24 hours before mounting the 10C on to ensure it has settled properly.<br /><br />- Main Unit, Speakers & Microphone:<br /><br />I found it easier to mount the 10C onto my helmet and getting it in the correct position before setting everything else up. The 10C slides onto the mount, then you can adjust the vertical angle by loosening the wheel then twisting the camera around, and then twist the lens for the horizontal alignment.<br /><br />The speakers slot into the rear-right port of the 10C and the microphone is then plugged into a connector on the speakers cables. Place the speakers somewhere that's comfortable (if your helmet has speaker pockets, even better), then insert the microphone somewhere secure such as between the cheek pads and the helmet shell whilst allowing the boom part to protrude out.<br /><br />♦ Intercom & Smartphone Set-Up ♦<br /><br />- Intercom (Sena Intercoms):<br />1) Whilst powered on, hold the jog button down for 5 seconds to enter intercom pairing.<br />2) Ensure the other Sena headset is also in intercom pairing mode.<br />3) Press the jog button.<br /><br />- Intercom (Non-Sena Intercoms):<br />You will need to navigate through the 10C configuration menu by holding the jog button down for 12 seconds.<br /><br />- Smartphone:<br />1) Whilst powered on, hold the phone button down for 5 seconds to enter phone pairing.<br />2) Ensure your smartphones Bluetooth in activated, then search and click on 'Sena 10C'.<br /><br />♦ 10C Usability & Battery Life ♦<br /><br />- Usability:<br /><br />If you've used a 20S before then you'll have no issues in operating the 10C as the commands are the same, the only addition to learn is the camera button which is very simple to use.<br /><br />I would advise looking at the quick guide included or by using the one available on the app, which is great when you're on the go.<br /><br />The buttons are well positioned and are easy to use, it just takes a little practice to remember the commands.<br /><br />If there's one change I could make, it would be to match the size of the control wheel to the 20S. Although it's still at a size where it's usable, the 20S is much user friendly.<br /><br />- Battery Life:<br /><br />Sena have advertised the 10C in having battery life for the following:<br />∙ Talk time (Intercom) - 17 hours.<br />∙ Radio on time - 8 hours.<br />∙ Recording time - 2 hours.<br /><br />Testing the intercom or radio for such amounts of time is rather extreme, so I decided to test the battery life from full charge on the most battery draining feature, video recording, and these are the results I got:<br />∙ Recording without using any Bluetooth or intercom features in 1080p: 2hrs, 17min & 21sec.<br />∙ Recording whilst connected to my smartphone via Bluetooth and playing music in 1080p: 2hrs, 7min & 32sec.<br /><br />The 10C monitors the battery levels and will disable recording as to leave you with decent talk time left, which is a very good feature to have.<br /><br />All in all the battery life is quite respectful, however I do want to point out that it's not removable. So why is this a problem? Well, whilst not entirely an issue if it was just used as an intercom because of how little often you would need to charge it, as it's being used as an action camera, you will find yourself charging it more often. Rechargeable batteries have a certain amount of charging cycles before it dies, so for action cameras it's quite important to be able to replace them when they're rendered useless.<br /><br />♦ Audio Quality & Wireless Range ♦<br /><br />- Intercom Quality (10C connected to 20S):<br /><br />I couldn't say anything bad about the audio quality whilst having an intercom conversation.<br /><br />The other person was clear and easy to understand and apparently I was too.<br /><br />- Phonecall Quality:<br /><br />Being on the receiving end, the quality is only going to be as good as the other persons phone.<br /><br />The receiver from my audio stated that it was clear that I wasn't directly on a phone, however had no idea I was actually riding my motorcycle. He did point out that the quality he was receiving could have some improvement.<br /><br />- FM Radio Quality:<br /><br />This may vary from person to person depending on the area they're in.<br /><br />Basing it on my experience, the FM radio quality was absolutely superb, a huge improvement in quality from my 20S.<br /><br />No matter which way I turned my head or whatever directly I was riding, the quality was consistent.<br /><br />- Music Quality:<br /><br />I listen to various genres from classical, pop, rock, electronica and dub-step and I found the quality to be more than satisfactory; well balance and clear sounding.<br /><br />You can achieve a high volume level with very little distortion, however I really wouldn't recommend it that high as we need some road awareness with our ears for safety.<br /><br />- Intercom Wireless Range:<br /><br />For a Bluetooth device, the intercom range is actually very good (although not as good as the 20S).<br /><br />On a nice clear stretch, my friend and I were quite some distance away from each other, myself being quite a few cars in front and we had no noticeable drop outs.<br /><br />However, add some corners with a lot of obstacles in the way such as a lot trees and you will notice the range will decrease significantly, so just bare that in mind.<br /><br />♦ Action Camera Quality ♦<br /><br />- Video Quality:<br /><br />Video files are recorded in 44min 36sec segments, so once you've gone past that time on a constant recording it will automatically create a new file. All video files are recorded in the QuickTime Movie (.mov) format.<br /><br />As for video quality, I would say it's at an acceptable quality. Of course it's not going to be anywhere as near as the likes of Sony or GoPro branded action cameras, so if sharpness & clarity were a major factor for your videos, then maybe this isn't the right product for you, just remember that the 10C isn't marketed towards the same area as they are.<br /><br />To break it down, the 10C performs well in daylight. decently in cloudy and just about okay in low-light with street lights around.<br /><br />- Audio Quality (Voice Recording):<br /><br />I have to say that in this department I'm fairly disappointed. Although usable, it's not something I'm used to coming from using the 20S and Prism.<br /><br />Considering the Prism took the audio from the 20S via Bluetooth, the voice recordings came out so clear!

He did point out that the quality he was receiving could have some improvement.    - FM Radio Quality:    This may vary from person to person depending on the area they're in.    Basing it on my experience, the FM radio quality was absolutely superb, a huge improvement in quality from my 20S.    No matter which way I turned my head or whatever directly I was riding, the quality was consistent.    - Music Quality:    I listen to various genres from classical, pop, rock, electronica and dub-step and I found the quality to be more than satisfactory; well balance and clear sounding.    You can achieve a high volume level with very little distortion, however I really wouldn't recommend it that high as we need some road awareness with our ears for safety.    - Intercom Wireless Range:    For a Bluetooth device, the intercom range is actually very good (although not as good as the 20S).    On a nice clear stretch, my friend and I were quite some distance away from each other, myself being quite a few cars in front and we had no noticeable drop outs.    However, add some corners with a lot of obstacles in the way such as a lot trees and you will notice the range will decrease significantly, so just bare that in mind.    ♦ Action Camera Quality ♦    - Video Quality:    Video files are recorded in 44min 36sec segments, so once you've gone past that time on a constant recording it will automatically create a new file. All video files are recorded in the QuickTime Movie (.mov) format.    As for video quality, I would say it's at an acceptable quality. Of course it's not going to be anywhere as near as the likes of Sony or GoPro branded action cameras, so if sharpness & clarity were a major factor for your videos, then maybe this isn't the right product for you, just remember that the 10C isn't marketed towards the same area as they are.    To break it down, the 10C performs well in daylight. decently in cloudy and just about okay in low-light with street lights around.    - Audio Quality (Voice Recording):    I have to say that in this department I'm fairly disappointed. Although usable, it's not something I'm used to coming from using the 20S and Prism.    Considering the Prism took the audio from the 20S via Bluetooth, the voice recordings came out so clear! But with the 10C having a wired microphone, I honestly expected better.    Like I said it's usable, and to be honest a lot of people wanting to use this for motovlogging may think it will do just fine, I can see there being a lot of people finding the quality not acceptable.    - Overlays:    This is a really neat feature to have; if you're listening to music, FM radio or talking via intercom, these audio's will be overlaid onto your video recordings, and they come out rather clear too. Do note that the audio will be as loud on the recordings as you have it, so if it's too loud for your ears, it will be too loud on the recordings.    These of course can be disabled (much easier doing it through the app), as well as there being an option which is turned off by default, to allow you to record your phone conversations!    For me, the overlaying \\"Smart Audio Mix\\" is a much loved feature!    ♦ Smartphone App ♦    To anyone using the 10C, I would highly recommend downloading the 'Sena Utility' app on your smartphone as it's an incredibly useful app to have.

Overall I would recommend the 10C, just make sure it ticks your boxes before you go ahead.    ✔ Pros:  ✓ 10C packs a whole load of features into one unit.  ✓ Great looking device.  ✓ Simple mounting system.  ✓ Very good button layout for ease of use.  ✓ Intercom is very clear.  ✓ Receiving audio from smartphone is good quality.  ✓ Video tagging mode is a great additional feature for motorcyclists.  ✓ Battery life is impressive.    ✖ Cons:  ✘ Non-removable battery.  ✘ No 'UHD Voice Recording'.    ► Note: I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review
B00KH8UADM|5|as advertised, quick shipping
B002JBM9WA|1|This set of fog lights do not fit properly, the brackets are reversed and leave the fog lights aimed at a different direction, I'm not able to use them and it's to late to return them.
B0032GO49M|5|Excellent cheap vehicle speed sensor.  Worked perfect for my son's 1998 Honda prelude SH. R&R was fairly easy, just need to remove the intake hose and squeeze your way through the two 10 mm bolts.
B008L0GQ1I|4|good fit and shipped quickly had no issues with product
B004C4YRFO|4|The pictures on the buttons wear off fairly fast, but the price was great compared to the dealer
B0086PJXL8|5|This is a perfect frame for a black car.  Shiny and smooth it looks great!
B002UJ13QO|5|Everything for less that what it costs in any store. Made 4 heavily oxidated headlights brand new. Just take your time and do it right and it will come out perfect.

B000C9SKFQ|5|Excellent replacement for my '69 el Camino
B001AIZ5HY|5|To begin sanding your headlights requires a leap of faith. Bu this is 3M  who knows as much as anyone about abrasives, polishes, etc, and all worked well. Be careful of the splatter and use some finesse on the corners and you will be OK. I would say this kit is good for two headlight sets if used sparingly and restored the lights to about 80% of new. And unlike the wipe on coatings, this is long term.
B000JSQ4VM|4|Good quality expandable bags. I haven't hit the rain with them yet, but I did spray them down in Camp Dry. I have a BMW R 65LS and they go on easy and fit tight. I bungie the bottom hook to the passenger foot peg and all is good.
B0081S8SWU|3|did not meet marine requirments, no screen spark resistor on back,good for automotive cost to much to return just kept for a spare. this is a 5 wire system not a marine one wire.
B007ZDR8FA|5|Great product!!!
B00VGL6XHQ|5|I was very happy with the quality of this product. Perfect for my bump step.
B000EQ0RE4|3|Improved braking performance in my 2006 Ram 1500 but only lasted for 20k miles.  Would not purchase again.
B000BUQOCC|4|I purchased my RV used and while it had been very well cared for by the previous owner, the black water tank always read as being 1/3 full...even after I dumped and I knew that it was empty. So I took a cup of dishwasher detergent (not dish detergent) and mixed it with about 5 gallons of warm water and poured it down into my empty black tank. I went for a short drive (to agitate the water and soap in the black tank). Then dumped the black tank, followed by using the swivel stick. Fixed!!! The sensors were cleaned and my tank now reads correctly. I only give it 4 stars because I did have a problem with the water spraying out where the stick screws onto the garden hose. So you may want to use a little Teflon tape around the hose end before screwing the stick onto the hose. I now store the stick in my RV and I plan on doing a quick tank rinse at the end of the trip, after I do the final black water dump. I suspect that this will keep the tank and sensors clean and working properly. Oh...please note that the instructions say to keep the holding tank valve open while rinsing with the stick. I also used a small wrench to press or wedge the toilet handle into the open position while using the stick. This held the toilet open while using the stick.
B008L23QT6|5|good quality bike stands. i know they are not name brand but they get the job done and thats all that matters
B00MWQ6GQ2|1|These guys are WACK only 1 bulb work out of 3
B001UROUJO|3|little too small
B000FJS41I|4|It matches the pedals I also bought, simple install on a 2006 Scion xB. Only dislike is it doesn't completely cover the stock dead pedal pad on the floor.
B00JAA7PBS|5|Perfect fit
B005PSPD22|5|Exactly as described..
B00EKKDTZ4|5|Good quality. Super fast delevery.
B008UXT712|1|Great price but it only lasted 5 months.  Now we have to buy a new one. In the long run I'm not sure how much you'll save if you have to keep replacing it after only a short time.
B006WQRCHA|1|Very poor quality piece going to try timken replaced both 1 lasted 1month other lasted 2 months junk
B000WOH0P2|4|Very easy to put on. Looks great
B00EF084GS|5|no problems
B00CZEZNGU|5|Nice bright lights. Seem to use much less battery than incandescents that I replaced.
B0060KPNCO|4|Works exactly the way I'd expect it to. It would be nicer if it came with a windshield or water shield above the camera.
B00N2K6M2A|5|Pretty good for the price
B00EYC1VA8|5|Really love how easy this makes organizing your cords.
B00KI1MCAW|5|Buy now, works better than halogen, and costs less to run...
B00480J4UK|4|Better than my oem sylvania halogen in light strength but not white at all really disappointed
B00480BWCI|5|These are so easy to use.
B0016KGZ5W|5|Great
B0055AW0N0|5|Great!
B0081SC4GQ|5|Best idea ever!  We bought this for our MSU500 (Massimo), which sucks in all kinds of dust.  Not anymore!  I would say this has reduced the dust by at least 90%.  So happy we found this!
B012LPLZYQ|5|This keychain is awesome!  It is adorable, discreet and super heavy duty.  It is made out of really tough plastic, and the ears are really sharp.  It is way stronger than a similar plastic cat keychain I bought on Amazon, and the finger holes are way more comfortable.  I previously owned similar items made of metal, but they were heavier, made my keys jingle more, and actually broke when I tested them by punching a wooden board.  This My Kitty is much more durable and affords just as much protection and peace of mind as anything out there.  The color really pops and makes it easy to spot your keys.  Plus, it is made in the USA!!  A total winner!  I will be giving them as Christmas presents to all the women and girls in my family.
B002PQQ7VI|5|perfect
B00YFFPLLO|5|Like it a lot.  On second car and people comment about it all the time.
B003CR2ILM|5|easy install, check out K&N's you tube. Definate HP increase, about 1.5 MPG increase, sounds awesome but only when really getting on it so that defeats the purpose of looking for increase in MPG's. Overall, I think its worth the purchase.
B000KQ4IH0|5|Perfect fit!!!
B00JAI8PE6|5|gets the message across.....
B000C73K6M|3|All was good until I got to the springs I have a 1964 Impala 4 door<br />My springs are different on my car so I ended using the old ones<br />The site said this kit fit my 64 impala so something went wrong<br />But its OK I made do
B009M0S4U2|5|Good product
B006G2MJZU|5|These are awesome!
B000EDST1K|5|Holds securely to the top of our stove.  This item is better than having a stove cover!  I can use it as a cutting board and/or serving tray.  Does exactly what it claims.  Highly recommend!!
B00GY6LTX6|5|Love the product, but installation in Raptor required drilling. Rigid and other reviewers are not clear on this. Once it's installed, you will have no regrets. Pricey, but awesome.
B000NOQTQC|4|Wife likes it a lot better than the original in our 331MKS Cougar.
B004I0L2H8|5|Fast shipping! Great Item!
B000CO7DIQ|3|A
B009W9AUS2|5|This bracket is great, fit my Smittybilt X2O perfectly.  Just make sure fair lead pin spacing is approx. 8.75&#34; spacing.
B009FUF6DM|5|I Love it.
B003066NIY|4|this perfect, I recommend
B008FDDISK|3|It was beautiful when I got it. Put it on the window of my truck along with several others. The jewels fell of the first time it was washed and the edges peeled up after a couple months. The other things in the truck stayed I. Great shape. I would say it would be ok for something inside however not for use on exterior
B001PYTKT2|5|Exact same Dorman product my local OReillys parts store sells but it was $35 cheaper here. Installed with all now pads, shoes, rotors, drums and wheel cylinders on a truck with 300k miles. It has never stopped this good. My old MC was leaking into the booster, and this was a direct fit replacement. One word of caution, it did not come with bench bleeding lines (neither did parts store version) and I dont trust the plug method they sent in box (call me old school), so youll need to find some bleed screws with nipples and hose if youre like me (I had some laying around from a previous job)
B0050EEO94|5|Works great to cool my travel trailer.  Took a bit of time to install it (mostly peeling off all the old dicore) but once it's installed, it worked fantastic!  Seems very quiet for the amount of air it moves as well.
B003BZ9LRO|3|Installed on my 06 F150 5.4L Entirely too loud. I wanted noticeable but not obnoxious. Frequent backfire popping. Swapped back to my super 44 and am happy with it.<br />The super 10 may be for you but just a little much in my opinion.
B00T62RK1U|5|These lights are great.  I used them as replacements for auxiliary back up lights on my truck.  I replaced the halogen driving lights that were installed with these and I couldn't be happier.  Provide lots of clear bright light which is great when backing up or hooking up to a trailer.
B00Q7N5WVG|5|Beautiful blue exhaust! Very easy to install by yourself. Installed on my 2014 ninja 300 abs edition. See Attached a photo. Very fast shipping. Even comes with a few stickers and key ring that i now use. You will be heard with this! Sorry I'm all over the place, 1st review I've done but im just really happy with this product so i had to put it out there.<br /><br />Trying to figure out how to post a pic, idk how but when i figure it out ill get on it!
B005CLKKRU|4|not perfect, but cant beat it for the price
B001DH4BYU|4|Great working fan and good price!
B00H6JWULU|5|works great for us. recommend
B004K2FSXI|4|Decent product. They put way too much thread tape on the fittings, and as a result didn't really get it where it belongs which is in the threads. Just pushed out as it was assembled. Re-taped all fittings and it's fine now.
B008F8QHKQ|5|They look beautiful, and work as they were supposed too.  Easy to fit, 15 minute change, and I'm not very good with cars.
B000IG20S6|5|Use it in every car we own and every engine I have price is great too
B00IKKS4W8|5|Quick and easy to install and arrived right ontime.
B000OUW7X4|4|&#34;It is what it is&#34; Cant beat the price!
B000H961YI|1|Despite mixed reviews I took a chance on this. DOA. The quality control must be nonexistent. Thorough waste of time. Shame on you Schumacher!
B00JXOJXZC|5|Quick, 10 minute fix for my 1999 Silverado...No more &#34;service 4WD&#34; light..
B003U8UEBE|5|Fit great looks just like the factory mirror.
B009IFIMBW|5|Great product
B006WHKKGY|5|Fit great! No complaints
B009IYQTOA|5|Replacement part for our 2006 GMC Envoy rear hatch! Thanks to the informative video it was a super easy replacement and we are now back in working order!
B00GHT7ZYM|5|Great parts and price<br />Great services
B0002F668I|5|Appears to be a quality product.
B00O99UR5G|5|Love it use it everyday
B000NVW1LM|5|Unreal...stopped a leaking front main converter seal on an 87 Chevy van within a 15 mile drive...been leaking for 10 plus years...had to add a quart of trans fluid every 4-6 months. The speedometer gear seal still dripped...took it out to replace and it was far to gone to expect a miracle there. But that seal is easy compared to front seal. Wow, no kidding I'm impressed. I'll by it again no doubt. To cheap to not try it first.
B00NPBZEVG|5|These appear to be very high quality plugs. The fit and finish consistency from plug to plug was exact. The fine wire looked to be the same length on all 16 plugs ( I have a HEMI). They are expensive but I wanted my entire ignition system to be MSD. The motor idles smoother, lopes less at cold start, and throttle response improved a little bit. Truck seems a little lighter on it feet, feels like it takes less effort to get it moving.
B004RCZB38|5|A very good product.
B00AE4U6T2|5|Very handy and useful.  When I lay down my keys and forget where, or when they fall into a cushion, I can find them easily.  Great for making sure you don't lose anything.  I am going to put them with my remote next!
B00MB0E1WK|5|Very pretty and durable.  Better than described.
B003ZWEAJC|2|WE RETURNED ITEM DUE TO NOT FOR HER CAR....BUT ITEM WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF IT FIT.
B0088BAKXU|5|Fits my 1997 GMC 4wd Sonoma pick-up perfectly. Couldn't get the differential fill plug out, so having a cover with a drain and fill plug solved the problem.
B005CLNUC2|5|Great Product!!  Buy with confidence Fast shipping!
B00E8L58ZY|5|Nice!!! Works well!
B00D7HN0LE|5|Worked as advertised
B000C7UQNW|5|Worked perfect,I replaced headlight switch in my 2002 Chrysler 300m Special.The interior lights would flash on & off with gauge lights.No longer have this problem.Chrysler discontinued this part,so here you go.<br />Thanks Amazon for the inexpensive fix.
B0094A6UUQ|5|Was as expected. Solid materials.
B004O80QP8|5|Just like the just you buy at the dealership for your TDI.
B00GAPA7QQ|1|I installed it and it barely sprasy water on the windshield
B009ZSKNEG|5|Great
B000GU3MTK|1|Way smaller diameter than pictured
B00CCSVXYK|5|fit good works good...
B00FQT1NII|5|perfect!
B0009IQZH0|5|Fine
B00WFHVB3G|1|It didn't work at all. No improvement to gas milage or performance.
B005NLQAHS|5|Love having this around!
B0002SRCMO|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B00IC13DMQ|5|Great quality!!
B000BWCFT6|5|worked great
B004I124DI|5|I have a 2004 Mountaineer and this was a direct replacement for the driver's side fog lamp. It included a new bulb and was packaged well. Comparing it to the original revealed no significant differences right down to the adjustment screw. Replacing the original unit was best accomplished by removing the front wheel well mud flap (4 screws and two retainers) and leaning/sitting up in the wheel well to remove the three screws and then reverse the process. Less than 1 hours effort to accomplish and it looks good.
B004GCDU32|3|Serves the purpose. Came in gray. I believed it would come in black. Fits well.
B002N5DE2G|5|good
B000CGRNDO|5|I just put these on a few weeks back to replace some lower end shop brakes.  So far so good.  Excellent stopping power.  I didnt really have any &#34;breaking in&#34; experiences such as squeaks or anything.  Just top notch stopping.  Im hard as heck on brakes so Ill be very interested to see how perform over the years.<br /><br />Install was a snap, this was my first time installing my own.
B00UJ5YNYU|1|Filled with water and stopped working.
B000CGR4AG|5|AKEBONO ROCKS! I simply will not waste my time with junk brake pads...super high quality and the right price~
B004SFKJIQ|5|Works great.  My family takes it camping. Works for young and old
B002713IUY|5|good.
B000ETUD22|5|works great
B0028NEWCO|3|Nice glasses for the price.  Ran a little small for me
B000JZ33H8|5|Works great to eliminate the hyperflash from led turn signals.
B000XECJES|5|Very nice quality. Use for any cleaning or wiping job and as a microfiber screen wipe for kindle, nook or phone.
B00LBL2LFE|4|Product is quite cheap, but the customer service of this company is amazing, so I have to give them at least 4 stars.
B0001L0DFA|5|I liked this nozzle so much that I immediately order another one.  They work smoothly and leak-proof.
B00EAOIKWC|5|Fit just fine, keeps the air clean.
B0090W09Q4|5|Fast delivery, perfect fit. Thanks
B008PF1C2W|3|slow shipping but item is as described
B008H67X1I|4|I use it for hot tub lid, ultralight aircraft wing, boat covers and anything that is exposed to Arizona sun. In my opinion it has added several years to the life of these items.
B000CMHU4K|5|looks great on my FX4
B00RN6F7B6|3|It didn't work I think the gauge is  bad
B00SJP0R0Q|2|I am disappointed that the rack is made of molded plastic vs. some sort of metal with a max. weight carrying capacity of only 22lbs.  That's not what I was expecting from Honda and it clearly isn't capable of carrying the loads I would like to attach to the rear rack.  A quick check of Honda America's motorcycle website revealed that Honda doesn't disclose the racks weight limitation or materials of construction.  Had it's weight limitation and materials of construction been disclosed (as I believe it should have been), I wouldn't have spent my hard-earned money on it.  Now I am faced with replacing it next season when I go to purchase a luggage system for the bike.
B000COCRJ6|4|work adequately, no complaints
B00CBKBQBE|5|This is the same as OEM. Took out the old one and it looks exactly the same; same manufacturer and same part number, same quality and weight. Bought this through Amazon prime just in case the Chinese seller is a fake one as stated by a previous reviewer even though I paid a few bucks more. So this is for sure the real deal.
B001448KBC|4|Looks good especially the 3rd or 4th time you use it on the metal
B004555J02|5|This will go into a 4th gen. Although it has a small groove to accommodate for 3rd gen bumper, it has two pins for secure setup and found it can work for a 4th. Great quality too.
B00V5B3PT6|5|I am extremely happy with the product.  Putting it on was easy and it looks like it came from factory.
B00KN091UM|5|It looks great and was delivered as promised. I used the longer lock as was suggested.
B004PXWKLA|5|Fit great and look great.
B00GSOPLY2|5|89 fourtrax fits perfect
B004GE7SEC|5|worked great
B000KZ1Y3C|5|Instructions on programming could be clearer.  That aside, the remote works well.
B005CWSBT8|4|Unsure if it works but have no reason to doubt it. Item shipped was slightly different than what is shown in the picture.
B000BGM2U4|5|It's amazing how well things work when they're a perfect match
B000SL0R9K|5|Nice compact kit that has sat in the console of my boat for nearly a year.<br />I just used it for the first time with a small cut to my hand, and was glad to have it on board.<br />I especially appreciate the sturdy case, which is often lacking in these types of kits.<br />Definitely recommend it!
B00EC2CG9U|4|Didn't realize just how small they were, but that's really on me!  I just use them to keep the front time still on my bike on the mount of my car.  Does the job! And I have spares!
B00CQAR2DU|1|Thin material and small pin hole in it
B00030CYD8|3|a little undersized
B00K7935KQ|2|Poor quality
B00F5MUB66|5|What a difference between this one and the stock one. It's kind of a bad thing because we now enjoy taking showers in our rv so we end up using more water. But the shower head is great, efficient, and has a on/off valve. It is a little bigger than the stock one but it didn't change anything in our shower.
B0078UAIH0|5|Fit my dana 44
B00CUREA5C|5|Great product
B010THNN2A|1|Genuinely one of the WORST fitting accessories I have bought for a wrangler. I've had 5 wranglers and this is my second JK. Love how many options there are to customize and make it your own. I have always had good experiences with rugged ridge as well. This product is absolute garbage. None of the clips line up and after two hours off cutting and aggregation I managed to get a few clips in place enough to hold it securley. The only reason I don't have the original grille back on is because of the amount of effort it took to get this grille in place. Alignment with clips and the cutting aside, the original grille is probably a good 1 inch wider. The gaps between the edge of the Spartan grille and the front quarter panels are huge. The instructions basically tell you anything you do or use to clean the product will damage the matte finish. It literally tells you not to use normal car soaps or paper towels even. The hand prints left from wrangling it in to place won't come off. There is no way of remounting the temp sensor without removing a few of the clips holding the wiring harness in place and leaving them stretched across the radiator.<br /><br />I could keep going but the point is that rugged ridge designed something that is poorly planned out and impossible to install out of the box. I'm glad I didn't waste money getting it painted body color before realizing.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY. It's unacceptable that they've released a product designed for one specific body style that fits so poorly
B00153EYR6|5|A must have for any go power inverter! Easy to install and use. I like being able to turn the inverter on and off from this panel as my install hides the converter under our bed - not the easiest place to get to. Be careful pulling the connecting wire - I broke mine when trying to fish it through my wall... called customer service - they sent a brand new replacement unit just to make sure it was only the cable! Outstanding customer support!!
B00EAJII1A|5|WORKS GREAT
B00EH6J162|5|The color Matched the paint of my truck<br />Perfect fit on a 1996 Ford F-150
B004IARFDS|5|Amazing sound out of the supercharger now super happy with purchase took about an hour to install. Can definitely feel a little more pull also. Don't know about gas mileage considering every time I hear the supercharger I just wanna hammer it haha. *Picture is before top plate was installed.
B000CM2VRG|1|The strips it came with were not durable at all. The mirror came off and broke already. Waste of money.
B000TE46SY|1|Harbor Freight sells this too. Same model number, same packaging, same everything. It's WORTHLESS. It's not even bright enough to strobe the crank pulley to &#34;stop&#34; it so it can be read. Totally worthless, except Harbor Freight unlike Amazon won't take a return/refund on it.
B000CHIL98|5|Fit like oem would purchase again. 2003 Audi a4 1.8t quattro.
B002QHFHNU|5|Very easy and quick to install and remove.  Didn't realize the camper turnbuckle would block the access door to my gas tank - with these quick release turnbuckles it is simple to release the fastgun in order to fill the gas tank.  So glad I didn't go with a cheaper turnbuckle that would take tools and time to remove and replace.
B0093N7NTG|5|Worked perfectly for 2007 ford edge awd
B0001EWCNS|5|Fits great.
B011AYZIW4|5|Very fast shipping, I just waited for 2 days to get the wraps. I used to have the fiberglass exhaust wrap and last week I bought this titanium exhaust wrap from amazon.  When I got my hand on it, I was attracted by the shinny and smooth surface. I realized this titanium wrap is much better than my old fiberglass one.  I replaced the old black fiberglass wrap and felt the power of my bike is enhanced.  When I drove my bike to meet my friends and they all said the new wrap fits my bike very well and has a distinctive look. Some guys also want to wrap one for their bike.  I am more proud of my motorcycle now.
B00OXPXUAK|1|I have the same problem as several others.  I tried with Volvo 1998 V70 and Chrysler 2002 Town & Country, using Galaxy S3 and S5.  The adapter red light would come on, but the phones could not connect.  I previously used a Power2 bluetooth adapter with the S3 phone and it worked great on both vehicles.  I gave the Power2 to a friend in another town and was looking to replace it with this adapter.  :-(
B00I89V35Q|4|Nice product made well
B00062W5TG|5|This works great on bugs and tar. By far the best product I have found.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Great lights. Very bright. No issues.  Fits ram 2013.
B00BMUI5OA|5|Great replacement for my portable jump starter. Turns out we needed it the same week I put the new battery in it.
B008KKMQZY|5|Parts shipped on time and arrived in good shape. These pads were very easy to install. This was my first attempt at replacing rear brake pads myself and it was very straightforward. The stainless steel clips that mount on the caliper means no grinding away any old grooves. I did both sides on my Jeep in about 30 minutes. The price on amazon was about one third of the price at the autoparts place.
B00HJ1592C|5|Just got it today, totallt awesome.
B004I11U5Q|5|This part was exactly as described. Part fit perfectly and was easy to install. i wish I had bought both sides.
B00CGTVCIC|3|Nice cover, but &#34;odorless&#34;?  No way anyone could possibly claim it's odorless - IT STINKS!  It smelled up not only the car, but the whole garage.  I had to remove it and it's been outside in the sun and wind for 3 days.  It still stinks too much to put in the car.  I'm sure it will eventually stop smelling and then it will be great.
B000KITSMI|5|Fantastic piece of engineering!  Love being able to replace Shraeder valves without draining the system!
B0016OMRBO|5|So nice. Keeps my son's truck organized. Costs toooo of much for what it is
B0002JEZ1O|1|Don't waste your $$.  I've bought 2 of these. They work for a few weeks and then die. It's just want I wanted, except that they don't work long.
B004EKYB7U|5|This fit perfectly in our 2005 Toyota Tundra.  Our A/C knob had cracked and would not let us turn off the A/C.
B00VAVVS8Q|5|Struts met my expectations, they arrived in just a couple of days.
B0013ERRSK|5|PERFECT, PERFECT one of the best investments we have made for our Aussie. Works great in the truck even while moving, no spills or lose of water.
B005G7Y5I0|5|excellent quality product
B00194CDFG|5|Chaps fit good and are quite rugged.
B000C98NLM|4|Good price... Good quality....
B000E63KKC|5|Fit just right for my 93 F-150 XLT. The ignition was loose and this replacement product made it feel like new. Was very simple to install.  Search on the internet for simple instructions.
B00HX526CU|5|This is great for what it is (and costs). LEDs are bright and it's got a pretty strong magnetic base to hold it in place.
B0035XGPNA|5|I have bought this product a few times already and keep going back when running low. It really keeps the dust away from the wheels. It keeps repelling as long as you don't wash or get the wheels wet. One thing to keep in mind is to make sure you apply the protectant on the whole surface and be careful not to miss a spot or you will see the dust build up within a couple of days.<br />Great product.  Wish they made a bigger size since a bottle will last about 2.5 applications.
B004C3C22K|2|so-so. difficult to get it tight
B00JXNJ36M|5|Works perfectly and even though you have to run the one wire to the engine compartment, it still took me a couple of hours.
B00KU17UXY|5|Good
B00LV18KWM|1|Product does not live up to claims. Junk, in my opinion. Wish I could get money back.
B00332GP1A|5|As always !!!! The product fit perfectly. No hassles or problems with the installation ... Thanks ;0)
B009S5IEBA|2|This one seemed like the best of all of these style fuel feed kits but mine leaked, for the price I wasn't terribly happy with it. I ended up making my own with aluminum tubing and 37* JIC fittings
B00415CKEE|1|went on perfect and worked
B00515NGVY|4|4 of the 8 were previously opened and taped shut. Otherwise, they seem to be working well.
B004J8NEW0|1|Car got written off before I put it on
B0055AW0N0|1|Does not hold in seat well and easy to knock over
B001W9OP86|2|Decent material but DID NOT even come close to fitting my car. It said online &#34;check to see if it fits&#34; which it gave me the okay. Nope, not even close. It also gives you a site to watch to help you learn how to put them on, which is some cases you have to CUT the material. Not a happy camper right now.
B00DPIF08Q|5|Fast delivery to Australia, kit as described. Thank you
B010JRG3CC|5|Absolutely love these
B00A23V5EU|5|showed up at my door on time and worked perfectly. thank you.
B006SYNF9K|5|worked great, bought this for a close friend and is very handy to keep the car from being hot in the sun and a pretty style while your at it
B00388BVTU|5|Awesome windshield, easy install and an EXCELLENT DEALER
B003XU6D50|5|I am a fan of Olympia gear and these gloves are a big reason why.  They fit my slim hands very nicely without any pressure points and without being loose.  The perforations keep my hands from sweating during warm days but are also definitely noticeable on cold rides.  The padded palms help sooth your hands during long rides and the velcro helps keep them snug on your wrists.  Only mediocre part is the plastic knuckle guards.  I'm sure they work, but they could be made better with a better mold.
B0045XDVQS|5|Luv makes car look great
B000WJYZFA|3|Does not seem to have nearly the capacity of the OEM battery it replaced. The price was good but in all honesty wish I had now paid more for a higher quality battery.
B007QFK8BS|5|Fits great, works fine, price is right. It's been installed into my 2007 Cadillac DTS.
B00G0PJ03W|5|I ordered this product twice, it is amazing how bright they are. I cannot believe that I have been buying stuff at the same price, when this ones are so bright, so good looking. I highly recommend this product! It is awesome!
B000EDQQD8|5|Perfect fit, it protects my system from over pressure
B000TYSBY4|5|good
B00ODVEWPG|3|Good light but not for switched applications.  I wanted to connect this to a light switch in my RV.  However, it uses a momentary push button to turn on and off with no memory effect as to its previous state once the power is turned off.  If you connect this to a wall switch, you can only turn it on by turning the wall switch on and then pushing the button on the light -- too much work for what I wanted to use it for.  I tried to hot wire it so that it would always be in the &#34;on&#34; state but that was not an easy task.  I ended up using these as supplemental lights but not as I had hoped.  If you have a constant 12V power supply and want to turn it on at the light then it should work fine.
B003V57NUQ|5|The box was a little beat up when I received it, but the contents were fine.  These are easy to put together and attach to my roof cross-bars.  I've used them twice thus far.  Seem to work well.<br /><br />Only thing I wish these had is an adjustable width between the longer and shorter up-rights.  My kayaks are pretty shallow and can wabble around in the J-Bar until I tie them down.  That is just on my wish-list.  Still giving them 5 stars...
B00II3SE40|5|These work great in my RV
B00029JJHE|5|worked well
B00B84IANG|2|One of the main reason I purchased this was for the GTI logo which did not have,  so I decided to keep it anyways but did not fit my GTI.
B001THSXHA|3|Lowest price I could find - nice looking, well packaged, shipped quickly, and came with bulbs installed which was a surprise.<br />Problem is, it leaks like a sieve. Washed truck after installing and water was everywhere inside the assembly. Had to disassemble and dry out. Tried sealing it with some RTV around the perimeter where the two pieces join (which never leak on the factory units). We'll see if that helps,If not, then I guess it's the old adage - you get what you pay for.<br />If you're concerned about such things (like me), then you should look for better units.
B00AN5MZ2I|3|It serves the purpose but I would think they can do a little better. It can be a bit clunky and not that great looking it was meant to be hidden I think.
B002BHWZFI|1|Did not work I my glass lens Costa Del Mars! Fogged as soon as I walked out of air conditioning and into the Florida heat. Not worth the money, I can clean with anything. I was looking for a anti fog product!
B0002SQYF0|5|Used it to polish metal pieces which had a film on them. Started with this and then moved to 7448 & 7445. Does exactly what it supposed to do - take out the thick film quickly. Didn't have to work too hard.
B000CRAYRU|3|Didn't even install transmission mount since I had fitment issues with Anchor engine mounts.
B009FUF6DM|5|Good value, fast shipping
B000IYWX94|5|Works great
B00BTLEIIY|5|Will this fit my 2010 Ford Focus?
B00S3XMSY2|5|I like the fact that this spinner does not need to be &#34;stuck&#34; in one place.  My boyfriend doesn't want to use it at all, so he can twist it out of his way.  I can move it to different positions on the steering wheel.  I like being able to turn the wheel by placing my palm on the spinner - especially when one arm is in a sling.
B0017UBHQS|5|received as required. no problems at all
B00G6KGPFM|5|Works awesome. TAKES MORE THAN YOU WOULD THINK.
B00PWG6AC4|4|As expected, will do the job.
B00E94KGBG|4|not the highest quality, but good for the price paid
B00GLJYLKO|5|great
B007H2PH02|5|Did the job
B006RW5NNY|1|The is how My package was delivered! Poor quality of the product...
B00B54SJIK|5|Came in on predicted date, installed it right away on a 2003 tahoe without xm BUT WITH a BAND button wedged module behind dash, ran wiring under climate control and under cup holder into the center console for a PERFECT factory/oem look have only had the chance to use Bluetooth and USB<br />Will update with any issues
B0077A87ZQ|5|I couldn't ask for better. I just happened to be browsing and found this one that had been returned. It was like new and 200.oo cheaper. Best deal I've gotten in a long time.<br />Super sturdy hard top, key lock on front panel, tailgate lock keeps back secure. Very happy with it.
B0028NB1SM|5|I do not wear glasses anymore due to cataract surgery but these glasses fit just right & protect my eyes well.
B0056R02V4|5|Love the deck<br />And is more then I could expected in
B00HEQO2SY|1|Cheap auction quality at inflated prices. Horrible customer service. 20 days no response to two emails. They live up to the horrible reveiws on the internet.
B00K889FCI|5|Work real well, and my daughter did it, meaning she never tried something like that before, big props to daughter and product
B00H5BQH2W|1|Horrible seller, adequite parts.
B00BFE6QQM|4|Got just what I needed. Make sure that you order the right one as there are 2 different ones.
B00L4GW0JI|5|really works and without too much elbow grease
B00H29LLWS|5|What a great price for two fans. I would have expected to pay that much for just one fan.
B006V4WCKU|5|Wife loves it ,happy wife happy life
B0031XDVF4|5|After some trial and error trouble shooting, I narrowed my problem down to the thermistor.  The Thetford 618548 Theristor assembly fixed the problem and was the perfect replacement for my Norcold 611 refer.
B007AOQUGC|5|Best floor liners I have ever owned for a pickup. So tough and easy to clean.
B00AWPQK8E|5|Perfect fit, looks great. I tried an aftermarket cover that said they would fit but it did not. Cannot beat Seadoo quality.
B000BH5MAA|3|Was excited to try this with my pop up camper.  Seems to work as described with one notable exception.  The ratchet wrench is cheap and defective.  While raising my camper the wrench locking mechanism repeatedly failed as if it were stripped.  This was very aggravating as I had to take it off each time and reset it.  I decided to buy a higher quality wrench from a local store.
B0002Z9NLA|5|Sounds great, and really opened it up.
B00NMOYPVG|3|it is a little slow and can not handle pressure but i am only using a 30lb recovery tank but it is good for residential use
B00KTJ8FM2|2|Not very pleased with these the first one only lasted about a week. They are very sensitive the trunk button pops open all the time.
B001F0IE7A|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.
B00EPDLYSA|5|Great product. A little heavier duty feeling than I thought it would have.
B0039234WM|5|Fit my auto perfectly. You cannot buy this item at any supply store, only at Audi who charges a lot more.
B004BYX8W8|4|Exact fit, insatlled easily without issue.
B00RLY4G1M|5|Looks great on my mom's back window! She absolutely loves it.
B00008RW9V|5|Works great on smaller jobs like the inside of the car or in the house.
B00UXIHNKE|5|Im from LA (born and raised) and this decal is def. LA. It just PERFECT on my 13 inch. MAC LAPTOP! Cannot wait to show it out in public so others can see my decal and show my LA Pride. What also made this awesome was the fact that it arrived TWO days earlier than it said it would. How can you not give that an automatic 3 stars? the two stars, well come on, its LA. 5 star piece!
B00SZK26T0|5|2nd time ordering from Opt7, very fast service! Item arrived in just a couple days! Seems to be very high build quality compared to other brands. Will continue to buy from Opt7!
B00BITI5RW|5|Arrived when promised, easy to install. No more rolling down my window to get out of my vehicle.
B006T0JC6S|5|was what it should be, lower price would have been better
B0040V0FWI|5|work great look awesome.. holds my 20's on perfect.. will buy again!
B000CB6D0S|5|As advertized
B008YFU3F0|4|I got it on time and VERY easy to install! only hard part is trying to figure out where to put the ballast at.. but rate a 4 is because i was expecting more distance on the light... but get what you pay for but other than that its good! see how long they last now
B00IUWM59O|5|Love having this battery for my scooter.<br /><br />The battery arrived fully charged, and having the voltmeter on top makes diagnosing electrical issues on your scooter or ATV very simple.<br /><br />Not really sure how the &#34;alarm&#34; function is supposed to work, but it does what a battery should do, which is power the starter on my bike!<br /><br />A great buy for the price.
B000RN2AHQ|5|The first use of this bag was a 1500+ mile road trip from Minneapolis down to Phoenix and it worked perfectly the entire time. The quality on the whole bag is excellent as are the magnets that securely hold it to your tank. The map pocket on top fit my phone running google navigation and kept everything water proof during the rain. The tank bag when loaded provided me a great chin rest for tucking on my SV650 on the freeway. There are cheaper bags out there but I think this strikes a good balance of price, value and quality.
B007N6PPQS|5|Worked good on my lbz, much more stout than the factory one.
B004RVCRXG|5|I purchased these lights being a little concern of the fit. No worries however because the fit was perfect. The headlamp includes the bulb for the headlight but does not include bulbs for turn signals. It takes a 10 mm wrench or socket for all of the nuts and a screw driver comes in handy. You have to loosen the radiator fill container to access a couple of nuts, but it is fairly simple and straight forward. They are very clear and make a big difference driving at night compared to those frosted old headlamps.
B00HYFYJXS|1|No instructions,no on off switch,the way I read it was easy hook up,not easy if I don't have all the parts with no instructions.
B00C61I2GK|5|easy to use
B00B7GRGLW|5|Finally!  I had previously ordered what I thought I needed, but this is what I really needed for a 2000 BMW 323i  E46.  This is for the Trunk emblem and it is slightly smaller than the hood emblem (and so are the grommets).  We had tried everything to get those other ones to fit, but finally decided to toss them and by these new ones.  They popped right in and the whole thing was done in 60 seconds.  I have included a picture to better show the size.  Hope this helps!
B006G2MJZU|5|thanks very good
B00EC2CG9U|5|Bought these with a bike rack and a frame extender for a beach cruiser. They work great to keep the tires and other loose parts on the bike from banging on the car.
B00QW2VUHM|5|Says it all beautifully!
B00BERR51K|5|Great value
B000C7YQ2Y|1|Did NOT match the european edition of Explorer (=Maverick).<br />So, cheap but useless
B00L9F3FW0|5|So far it is a great light easy to set flash pattern holds to the roof well . Cord could be a little longer but the other company's r the same
B00MQFTY7M|5|sexiness
B000F5ECUY|5|Good s***
B004GYZ81M|5|After the factory hub actually bent removing it while doing a wheel bearing replacement, I ordered this hub. Direct swap, fit perfect in the new Timken bearing that I also ordered from Amazon.
B00CEXKFNS|5|Perfecto fiat.
B0009IQZ2K|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B000EQRJQI|5|5 stars seems good not sure if the added price for powder coated was worth it time will tell last set was rusted very badly
B004HMBK5G|4|Oh what a relief it is!
B000CGMPX2|5|Good product
B00BOEJLA6|1|Terrible. ........the mount ripped, only a few weeks in.
B0040CTUPU|5|Went with these after reading reviews on cheaper ones. Worked great and held tight.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This is the first sunshade I have purchased or used. I do like the fact that it is made up of two circular frames. This allows it to fit around my rear view mirror and provides better overall coverage. It Is easy to install and remove. I use my sun visors to hold it in place at the top.<br /><br />It isn't a big deal but the storage bag could be a little bigger or have a wider opening with a Velcro closure. Part of that is me not being used to putting it in the storage bag and it took me a couple of tries.
B00EDFM3B2|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00Y1HQ9QM|5|worked well
B001OMVCGY|1|Have had 2 set both blew out. Will not buy again.
B00EFDJB8A|5|This is exactly what I ordered. I absolutely love this lanyard. And I will be buying more in the very near future.
B002FP7ZNS|3|Cap seems good enough but does not fit a Perko light.
B00COYZTYW|5|Perfect fit looks great and very nice fit. Glad I got this model. Wheel to wheel makes it very easy to get things out of the back of the truck. 5 stars all the way.
B00J9UBXAS|5|Wow these are awesome.
B00CO8UIF8|2|Did not charge from the 110 VAC unit. Did charge from the 12 VDC unit.
B00UVSI26A|5|Better then them circle ones.
B00N7ZPJC4|5|Great fit
B00L40ZQGS|3|Has two settings and works as instructed. A good product for the price. Just realize that this just pushes the air around, it does not actually cool the air. So if you are in a hot car and use this product, it will just blow hot air at you.
B000C57KGK|5|very pleased with the GAS magnum shocks
B008XKLAFI|4|good replacement
B000C7QFIW|5|GREAT
B006O85Q74|5|good product, fast service, thaks
B000QJG1F8|5|Sounds Amazing
B00X3ENPJ8|3|would be great for small scissor jack, not made for larger models bolt was too short to fit my jack but it was easily solved. Good quality other than that. Fast Shipping!
B002JGZLQ6|3|The Actual Caliper was great, but the Brake Pads that were included were too thick and I had to go to an auto parts store after I had taken my rear wheel off to get new pads that would fit.  The included pads would not let me even install the Caliper on the Rotor.
B000TDOHPM|5|Very good mirror
B00LDVID90|4|Like the previous comment mentioned this is a vinyl sticker and does not come domed or anything its just flat. It does look good but only if you have maybe an all black wheel set up or flat colors instead of chrome lug nuts. I would of loved these if the snake was made with a chrome like finish just like the original cobra wheel caps but for the price this will do for now.
B004F5DKYO|5|Was a opened package which is what I ordered save 20 bucks it was perfect worked like a champ
B00KXNR548|5|great light . it does it's job.
B00PNUIKDG|5|Exact fit, easy installation.
B0008G5G4Q|5|Not what I needed but was what was described
B003H27CG8|5|I love these - they help cut down the glare & I can see through them!
B000CP86ZE|5|Looks awesome...better than expected since they're a generic fit.
B0002ZG7YQ|5|I used these to mount a headlight bracket on my motorcycle (38mm fork tubes).  They work great but I did have to shim them a bit since they were closer to 39mm.
B005GLN0Z0|5|Very nice. Fast shipping.
B00X2TUW1I|5|Love the product!
B00RU0L5OI|5|Nice
B00GWLK66E|3|thought it could be better
B004KEIHRA|5|Item is as advertised.
B0009OA4JO|5|Fit perfectly. I did have to get a different size bolt but no big deal
B008V1KIOS|5|The subframe brace fit perfect on my 93 civic hatch.
B000C7ZT16|5|Perfect fit and oil light went off
B000AP6REI|5|love it
B000F5DQWY|4|Fairly loud and certainly louder than the stock horn
B00L5204O4|5|Great little lights, very bright, good lens spread pattern.  These aren't a spot, they are more flood than spot.  They are well built and seem very durable.  I have them mounted on my hitch mounted luggage rack for added visibility.  They fit the bill perfectly.
B00UNAO98Q|5|It was in good condition
B00U21P5GG|2|they were not sticking well to the car an then had to figure out how to put them on with out directions
B00G9W9TK0|5|This proved to be very handy on our recent trip.  It attaches very securely to the bike and detaches easily and converts to a back instantly.
B00TANOEEQ|5|These lights are absolutely solidly built, easy to install, very bright and perfect for the front of our 1998 Jeep Wrangler. My son and I like them very much, and we would recommend them to others.<br /><br />Since the Jeep had an old pair of driving/fog lights already installed on the front, there was already a wiring harness in place for us to use.  We have tested several replacements for those old lights, and this pair is our current favorite. The stainless steel brackets that comes with this set are OK; they are the only component that I would consider beefing up (prefer matching powder coated aircraft aluminum).<br /><br />Installation was not a difficult job:<br /><br />* Took off the old lights and put these in their place<br />* Connected the light wiring to the harness leads already in place<br />* Tested the lights to make sure all connections and the switch operated as expected<br />* Used good quality electrical tape to seal up the wiring connections<br />* Zip-tied the lights wiring in place where needed to keep things from flapping around<br />* Hit the road<br />* Returned and made a couple elevation adjustments to aim the lights down a bit... they are bright<br /><br />All told, this took about 45 minutes.<br /><br />These light seem to be very high quality, and once mounted they are rock solid. Each light contains four rows of four 3W LEDs, for a total of 48W (3500 lumens +/-) of 30 degree spotlight power. Each unit weighs in at bout 1 pound 13 ounces per our postal scale, and are 4.25 inches wide, 2.7 inches deep (front to back), and about 4.25 inches tall excluding the base post height.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality set of light of this size, construction, brightness and style, for use as I have described above, then my son and I would highly recommend giving this Kaleep set a try based on our great experience with it. Was a fun father & son project last weekend.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

B006B7YVLK|5|As far as sound goes, it's basically a lower, louder version of the stock exhaust.  It doesn't pop, or make raspy sounds; the tone is very smooth.  The car seems to have more power as well, so that's nice :)
B008OZSNA2|2|had one of the lights burn out within two months. asked seller to send replacement bulb, still waiting.
B002ZKEV4O|5|The compressor works fine; I was glad to get it for a good price
B00KQSM63A|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B002UC19R4|5|good
B00NBSFJ72|1|Adhesive is bad
B0002SRE8Q|4|I have never used a Helicoil before . Instructions would have been very helpful.
B00E1SMW1M|5|Installed on my 05 Trailblazer with no trouble. Seems to be good quality
B00NGWOEUQ|5|very cool item, had to put a small amount of tape around the part that inserts in the receptacle as it was a bit loose without it . Everyone that looks in the interior notices it
B00902G3OQ|5|Fit perfectly and easy to install.
B007473QNU|4|Worked Fine, Happy with it
B0084LUWLY|1|junk
B00HJEUUKU|5|These work great in my aftermarket taillights. They are bright and fully functional as brake, taillight, and turn signal. You do need to install a 50W 6 ohm load resistor to eliminate hyper blink.
B000HPQ1EW|4|quick delivery. Fit for my 2007 caravan, should order two for front.
B001GRW1PI|2|Usually love weather tech, in our other car the mats fit awesome, however after purchasing front to back mats for Expedition Limited at $300 & the back seating did not fit good so the sales rep said I could &#34;cut them myself&#34; to make them fit ?? Really
B0027ZKL6Y|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00029JC5S|3|Little pump seems to work really well.  But it's so freakin' loud.  Gotta figure out a way to isolate it better than the 1/32&#34; rubber gasket provided by the folks at Holley.
B0066QMMDA|5|Good!
B00NOA8NCU|5|bright look real crisp thanks definitely buying again!
B003CSYP4E|5|Difficult installation - took me about 4 hours. Had to apply a lot of force to widen the product to seat on the bolts coming down from the frame. Its heavy duty and seems very strong. Would recommend taking it to a place to have it installed for you.
B0009IQZFM|4|Works very well so far see how it lasts after being washed several times.
B000EM019O|5|Used SEM plastic paint prep and shot all the plastics on a 2004 Jeep Cherokee. came out perfect1 Great product.
B004IYY8SY|5|Had a P1457 on a 99 Accord, swapped this out and the code has not come back for 2 months. A shop quoted me $275 to fix the problem, decided to take a chance and throw this part at the problem. Swapped it out in 2 hours because I'm a slow worker who doesn't know what he's doing, used a really basic tool set to do the job.
B00EDWF1BE|4|I was tired of all the hood flutter at highway speed. This solved the problem but not without a bit of head scratching trying to install them. After several knuckle-busting attempts at getting to the nut behind the fender I decided to remove the front grille. That made all the difference. After that the install was pretty straightforward. No more hood flutter. I don't understand why Jeep still uses those rubber straps when this is a much more practical and effective method of securing the Wrangler's hood.
B00UUSV1P0|5|Feeling nice and prepared with this tool. Great quality. happy with this purchase and planning to purchase as gifts for all my favourite drivers!
B000C7TV5G|1|did not fit my 74 Duster..  :(
B000FLF4T6|5|This worked as expected.  I really like knowing what the outside temp is.
B005FG64VS|5|Wow!  I wasn't convinced that it would be a perfect match but when I installed it the lens assembly fit like a glove.  The lights came pre-installed and the harness was an exact match with the original.  I am impressed!  Installation was a breeze.
B0023VEWCQ|4|loved them both. works well on car. Thanks
B000C7YLWY|2|Sometimes works bad
B00MYHE13Y|5|This fit my Prius V passenger seat keeps all my stuff organized.
