B003XA0F5O|5|This is the Best Doctor Who series ever!     Matt Smith is Doctor Who Eleven and Karen Gillian is the new companion.  This series rocks in every way, the acting, the music, the costumes, the creatures, the special effects, the writing, the directing, everything! This series is exciting, fun, scary, mysterious, heart breaking and life affirming. You will laugh and cry. This is the best of the best! This is smart, you'll learn something, you'll feel something, television.    Matt Smith is marvelous! He plays the Doctor like he's a hip, rock star, mad scientist. He is the best Doctor ever! He makes the part his own, and makes you forget about all the previous Doctors. His predecessors are great too, but he has quickly become my favorite. Smith has so much fun with the part. He's awesome, he's on fire!       Karen Gillian is both beautiful and smart. She's the Doctor's partner and she's no dummy! Her character Amy Pond is smart, fun, brave, and a hero in her own right! She is independent. She isn't the damsel in distress, she isn't arm candy. She's the best female character in science fiction since Princess Leia. Yes, she is that kick-ass awesome!    This series should be enjoyed from the beginning, because each episode builds on the last. This is comedy, mystery, horror, fantasy, fairy tale, romantic drama, and science fiction. This series will appeal to everyone.   This is for everyone, not just fan boys and fan girls.
B00CHSPB8Y|4|Fantastic visual<br /><br />, great concept. Takes much longer to play if you don't buy upgrades. Really fun to play. I enjoy it.
B00BHMETKC|5|This movie keeps you on edge the whole time! A+ cast. Actors did a great job just being real people in an insane situation. At first I thought that the acting could be a little better and then I realized that theses are actors protraying everyday people, newlyweds, annalists, etc.. So DUH! They did a great job! A definite must see!
B00B5AAW52|5|I'm sure there are many reviews that you can find of Gilmore Girls but I just want to say that I haven't found a show that I have loved so much as this show and has made me feel so good.  I still look for a show that makes me feel as happy as Gilmore Girls has but have yet to find it.  It's not only heartwarming and at times heartbreaking but it really is one of the funniest (serious laugh out loud moments) and quirkiest.  Stars Hollow is a wonderful place filled with strange but loveable characters that I'm sure you'll also fall in love with.<br /><br />I really like this new box set.  For years I have had each individual season and have taken care of them.  Originally I was going to buy the \\"doll house\\" box set but I decided not to because of the price and the cardboard sleeves that might scratch the discs, and it might look awkward on my shelf.  The reason I really wanted the doll house is because it had all new complete updated guide to gilmoreisms (in the individual seasons the Gilmoreism guide is only in seasons 2, 3, and 4) but after much thought I decided I could live without it.  I really like this box set because it takes up less space.  Each season is only an inch and when they are all in the box you can just turn it and it only takes up less than 6 inches of space on your shelf.  What I love most about it is that all the seasons are the same size in nice plastic cases (discs still protected of course) instead of the outer paper/plastic inner cases.  Maybe it's just me but I hated that the first two seasons were quite bigger (though I realize those sizes kept a lot better and never broke) and seasons 3-7 were the same size but those had the horrible plastic things that were just taped on the binding and would never stay together. So this set doesn't have anything new sadly-same features as stand alone seasons, though I knew that beforehand.  The only thing that would have made this set is the complete guide to gilmoreisms like I mentioned before.  Oh well.  I really like this nice looking, clean set and so compact.  And it's a steal (at $64)!.  I really like this nice looking, clean set and so compact.  And it's a steal (at $64)!

0142407542|5|We discovered the The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child at our library a few years ago and my little guy cannot get enough of these books and the accompanying DVDs. The books are predictable and the rhyme flows smoothly. My little guy  knows them both by heart.
B00003CX6P|5|In the early sixties, French star Alain Delon had already impersonated Tom  Ripley in the first version of Patricia Highsmith's novel. Directed by Ren&eacute;  Cl&eacute;ment, PLEIN SOLEIL (High sun) was interesting but Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment was  obliged to hide the ambiguous side of Tom Ripley and focused his attention  on the machiavelic plan that Ripley imagined in order to commit the perfect  murder.<br />Forty years later, director Anthony Minghella can at last  translate into images the subtlety of Tom Ripley's character. In my  opinion, Matt Damon is OUTSTANDING as Ripley ; he could kill a dozen  persons and we would still find good reasons to forgive him. He is only a  victim of unfair circumstances.<br />The cinematography is also to be praised,  Anthony Minghella declining one by one the whole litany of the visual  symbols for the theme of the double. Great musical score and actors giving  excellent performances. Since the DVD also offers interviews, a commentary  and the usual trailer, you can without hesitation consider THE TALENTED MR.  RIPLEY as<br />A DVD for your library.
B003JTHXOK|5|Wonderful book. One for your must read lists. Nicolas Sparks out did himsef in this one. Can't wait to see the movie now.
B0015DWJX2|5|A different novel story line.  I have never read so many letters before.  This makes for a unique read, the story has so many facts that I had never heard.  The history blew my mind and made me remember what I read in my history books.  There is some sadness and some happy stories here.  I didn't want to put this book down and was sad when I finished it.
0316134082|5|I love this series!! These collector books are high quality and our perfect for yourself and also to give as a gift.
0671004107|4|While this book is in need of editing and is at times a much too explicit an advertisment for Mr. Sagan's scientific philosophy (read _The Demon Haunted World_), it is still a good book with a very well done ending. This is not science fiction in the traditional sence as much as it is a sort of a science novel, in the safe vein as Gregory Benford's _Timescape_ (which I enjoyed more than _Contact_). The other major problem with this work is that Sagan's forte is as a nonfiction writer and not as a novelist. So at times _Contact_ shrugs under the weight of too much wordless narration without dialogue. Many of his ideas are interesting but feel out of place in the novel, thrown in to boost the page count. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if you're a Carl Sagan fan or a fan of science fiction, but don't expect incredibly wonderful Arthur C. Clarke-esque things. There are better &quot;first contact&quot; novels out there, like Clarke's _Rendevous with Rama_ or _2001_ to name two of the best.I don't intend to see the movie, since a _lot_ of things from the book appear to have been changed
B000T3NMYE|5|Just as Art Blakey And The Jazz Messengers had already topped the jazz charts         while making their rounds with their live performances, they released another highly         acclaimed album in 1958 that became another part of their long spectacular legacy,         one that would become an apex in The Jazz Messengers’ position on the top of the         jazz charts.  Fronting a new line of Jazz Messengers that solely include the dashing         trumpeter Lee Morgan and pianist- composer Bobby Timmons, they scored another         blockbuster hit with Moanin’, released in late 1958.  What makes this award-winning         hit so ironic is the exclusive appearance from saxophonist-composer Benny Golson        who provides several of his greatest and best known compositions, as it showcased         another phase in their creative artistry.  Headed with an excellent track set featuring         that begins with a brief warm up and dialogue by Morgan and Rudy Van Gelder, the         the robust track set begins with the title track and conclude head on with classic hits         like Along Came Betty, The Drum Thunder Suite (a mesmerizing piece made up of         three movements), Blues March (which call on the fleeing of New Orleans marching         bands) and their take on the standard Come Rain Or Come Shine, until ending with         the alternate take on Moanin’.  Hailed as one of the archetypal hard bop albums of         of all time, the power of this album come directly from the command rhythm section         that is abeited the highly modified lilting arrangements, while Golson hits outlandish         intensity in his fast solos and Timmons gives his piano solos a solid majestic touch         that adds to the magic.  Filled with outstanding musicianship, solid music, excellent         timing, dynamic artistry and high voltage hard bop performed with such astounding         power, Moanin’ is a stunning work of art that ranks as one of Blakey’s greatest and         most important achievements, one will it always remain a timeless turning point for         for the rich spectacular legacy of Blakey and his Jazz Messengers.
B004SBULWE|4|This free app works pretty good for most apps in shutting them down.  Yes, its free and yes, what do you expect for free.  Still, its pretty decent and if it shut down every task, then I'd give it a 5.  As it is, its a 4.5 to me and well worth it on my Pipo and my wife's Samsung Galaxy Note.
B00003CXSP|3|If you thought Silence of the Lambs was gory, well you haven't seen anything until you've seen Hannibal. This has some of the sickest scenes I have ever seen. The dinner scene is especially stomach turning. Their are some fine performances in the film, great locations and Ridley Scott's direction is very good. However if Hannibal wasn't so gross and graphic it could of been great. I mean just how many times do we have to see closeups of the distorted Gary Oldman's face ?
B005J0VPNC|1|I downloaded this app for the Verizon's Droid Eris and it's absolutely worthless. When you open the app, you just get a blank dark screen and the phone seizes up completely. Like another Droid Eris user posted previously (should have listened to him...lol) I had to take the battery out to get it working again and uninstall the app. Too bad, because I was looking forward to playing with this app. I hope the developer works on this app further to include a version that works with the Droid Eris.

So basically unless I spend money for my progress that I achieved I can't go on.. That's bs if you ask me...<br /><br />Oh and also you can only pass a certain amount of levels until you have to wait 30 minutes. Just another lame attribute.

0345495004|5|WOW!<br /><br /> I do not know if I will be able to review this book properly or give it all the props it deserves. This is a time when I wish I was really good with words and fully express how great this book was and how it really touched me. I guess, those words will have to be enough. I just hope they do it justice.<br /><br /> I have been wanting to read this for some time, as I am quite fascinated with Frank Lloyd Wright, but know virtually nothing about him except that he was a BRILLIANT architect in a time when people wanted gaudy and pretension and not brilliance.<br /><br /> To some extent, this story is about him. And what he was about, and his total and complete passion with building and the lines and spaces he was obsessed with. But, this story is mostly about Mamah (MAY-mah)Borthwick Cheney, a lovely HIGHLY-EDUCATED (in a time when women just weren't educated at this level as a rule, and gifted with languages) society woman, who (when her husband suggests they build a new house) meets and then falls in love with FLW and engages in an affair with him. This book is the story of their love affair and how it completely and utterly shocked the world and forever changed their lives and those who were in it.<br /><br /> Weaving fact and fiction together masterfully, the author uses what she researched and what she made up very well. Without the notes at the end telling you what is fact and what is fiction, you would believe it was totally fact. And for the most part, it is. People are added here and there to fill in the gaps, but this IS a true story. These two people existed (though little is found about Mamah in FLW's stories at his houses and workshop)and loved in a time when loving outside of marriage was a HUGE taboo. I completely fell under the spell of this book and it has stayed with me for days since. I just cannot get this remarkable woman out of my mind. And why I cannot agree with WHAT she did, I totally understand WHY she did what she did. What wouldn't we do for true, complete love??<br /><br /> FABULOUS READ!!!!!!te love??     FABULOUS READ!!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5|Sophisticated, smart, charming and funny. What more could you want in a show? The characters are incredibly convincing and if you've never like lawyers before, you will now. It's provocative in a smart way and makes you really wanna suit up Barney Stenson style but act lawyered like Marshall. Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed!

6304372620|5|A lot of controversy surrounded &quot;Sleepers&quot; regarding the author's claim that his work was based on a true story which actually took place in New York's Hell Kitchen in the 1960's. The New York State Juvenile  Authority and the New York City Police Department deny the story's  veracity.<br />Nonetheless, the story is outstanding. Set in the 60's, it  involves the lives of four boys and a girl from different families living  in Hell's Kitchen on the West Side of Manhattan.<br />The story does a fine  job or portraying the fact that these kids don't come from one of the  &quot;finer&quot; New York neighborhoods of the day. They are the kids of  single parents and hardworking blue collar folks. There is too much  drinking at home, domestic disputes, and other glimpses of a hard life  growing up.<br />The story kicks into high gear as the kids pass summer days  sunning and getting into hijinks. One of their antics is to cheat the hot  dog vendor out of his hot dogs. They do this once too often and a serious  chase ensues where the hotdog vendor pursues one of the kids for blocks  after he's been ripped off. The other three boys decide to move his hot dog  stand so he'll have to look for it when he returns.<br />Tragedy occurs when  there is a serious mishap with the hotdog cart that ends up hurting a  man.<br />The boys are charged with stealing the hot dog cart and associated  charges. They are sent to juvenile training school for rehabiliation  together.<br />The Training School is hellish. Guards led by a mean, hateful  Kevin Bacon; the kids are subjected to humiliation, solitary confinement,  verbal abuse as well as physical and sexual abuse. Bacon does a masterful  job of portraying a truly horrible human being who enjoys abusing  kids.<br />Years later the boys get a chance for payback against the guards.  <br />The story steps up from here as Brad Pitt (now an attorney) masterminds  the punishment of the four guards who abused the boys most.<br />His tactics  are effective. Yet, each of these men remain psychologically marked as a  result of the destroyed innocence of their youth.<br />Robert DeNiro does an  excellent job as the local parish priest who looks out for the boys. DeNiro  plays a tough, caring man who is a wonderful minister for the kind of  neighborhood his parish is located in. <br />Sleepers is memorable. Although  there are some very difficult scenes, I believe the abuse portrayed within  the Training School is not overly exaggerated. In a past time when guards  were minimally screened or trained, the treatment kids received wasn't  always the most professional.<br />I believe this will become one of  tomorrow's classic movies.
B00KZ6WRAA|3|excellent product
B003G4W49C|5|Reading a book about a child hero is always enjoyable, yet troubling. No adult wants to see a child grow up TOO fast, lest the child become blase about life. So it goes in this book. Ender grows up TOO fast for his own good, but fast enough for his war-mongering elders. The end is fitting and soothing, and makes the book worthwhile. Enjoy!
B0059ILFJ8|5|My love of this band goes' back to the late 60's in San Francisco. This album captures for me the Dead's essences. Jerry and the other members did more than just play the songs they transport you to a different place. There is lots of great albums of their music, but with out American Beauty you are missing one of their best. Having it on vinyl only makes it better.
B000002KEV|5|Made in Japan captures Purple at the height of the Mark II success. (Later incarnations of the band simply do not reach the musicianship on display here). The playing is frenetic. Highway Star is played at such breakneck speed as to take your breath away. It contains the now classic solos from Jon and Ritchie. Jon's solo is based on a Bach progression and Ritchie's on a Mozart sequence. The playing is precise. Glover and Paice are in my opinion the best ever rhythm section in all of rock. Ritchie Blackmore displays throughout the album why he is one of the best if not the best ever rock guitarist. (His playing is leagues above Jimmy Page's). From superb precise fast playing to tasteful solos. His solos on Strange Kind of Woman is one of his finest-the note selection, phrasing is wonderful to hear. To the young players-it isn't always about playing the fastest scales. The version of Smoke on the Water is in my opinion THE definitive version of this song (and I have heard well over 300 in my life). Lazy is superb-I love Jon Lord's intro-getting those sounds out of the Hammond and then going into a jazzy bit. Ritchie's spontaneity where he breaks into Swedish Rhapsody is priceless. Space Truckin' is fun. The Mule showcases Paice's drumming abilities and shows why he is one of the best. Child in Time is really good. It is always amazing to hear how Lord and Blackmore play all those fast notes together. They really did bring out the best in each other. What is truly amazing about this album is that what you hear is what happened. There is no going back to the studio and fix something, overdub something, etc. The tapes were simply mixed and the power on display is evident.    Another superb live album from Purple is Live in Stockholm - 1970. This comes from the period where Purple was still pretty much an underground band and had not had the critical success that would come in a few years. However, some of the shows they did from this era are some of the most exciting they were to ever do. The version of Child in TIme here is in my opinion their best. Ritchie's solo is mind blowing. During this time period, they did some incredible improvisational segments (going anywhere from 20-40 minutes in length!) and as a result their shows would run well over 2.5 hours! Chekc out Wring that Neck - some incredible improvs. Purple had the ability to do rock, jazz, classical, blues and it is all demonstrated here. Mandrake Root was the lengthy show closer (replaced by Space Truckin' later on) complete with strobe light sequence. There is a version of Black nIght on here which is one of my favorites as Gillan and Blackmore duel it out at the end.    To sum, Deep Purple were best on stage. They are all superb musicians. Their live shows/albums are better than the studio versions. In my opinion, the two best ever rock bands were Deep Purple and ELP. Why? - those two bands have the best ever musicians and gave superb concerts. (I am a keyboard player myself and Jon Lord and Keith Emerson were the two I tried to emulate the most). It is interesting how Led Zeppelin gets all the accolades. While a good band, they really do not compare to Purple. (I was at the concert that became The Song Remains the Same - it was an okay performance). Purple deserves to be in the Rock Hall of Fame. If you are not familiar with Deep Purple, Made in Japan is an excellent introduction.
B00KQFP5GS|3|Good movie, not so good acting.
B003YL4LYI|5|Dreaded the end of the book...since it will be like forever for the next one to come out....but awesome, just like the ones before. The man has an incredible imagination. One of my all time favorite.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|Well written for a non academic audience.  I found the description of the evolution early Christianity and the dichotomy between the teachings of James (Jesus' brother) and Paul (self described 13th apostle) very informative.  It's an interesting take on how Christianity became 'Romanized' after the destruction of Jerusalem in the first century C.E.  Only wish I had the patience and inclination to explore the all the references noted at the end of the book.
B00000ADG2|5|&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is the best CD I've heard in years. It is already considered a classic.  &quot;Miseducation&quot; is so deep you can't even describe it in a few words. This CD has everything.   Songs like &quot;Lost One&quot; and &quot;Super Star&quot; gives you a  taste of her untouchable rap skills.  While at the same time songs like  &quot;I used to Love Him&quot; and &quot;X Factor&quot; lets us feel her  words though her powerful singing. &quot;Miseducation&quot; is full of  hip-hop beats with a soulful R&amp;B feel.  Lauryn really went deep into  herself to make this album and you can definetly feel it when you hear it.  I must say the two most powerful songs on this project are &quot;Nothing  Even Matters&quot; (a duet with D'Angelo) and the title cut &quot;The  Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;  These two songs are out of this world,  they way they are composed and sang, takes you to another world.  Every  song has a different meaning and feel and really &quot;educates&quot; us on  what an album SHOULD sound like

0440178002|4|As the first in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\" this book can be read as a stand alone novel. It follows a British ship pilot named John Blackthorne who meets a Japanese daimyo Toranaga and witnesses (and occasionally assists with) Toranaga's rise to power in feudal Japan.<br /><br />This book is loosely based on the life of William Adams and is a fascinating look at Japan in the 1600s. Clavell is able to capture and describe much of the early Japanese culture and it is very informative. As Blackthorne learns more about Japanese customs and way of life he realizes it will be difficult to return to England. He gets used to bathing regularly and to the Japanese attitude towards sexuality. Of course, his return to England isn't in his control, whether he fully realizes it or not.<br /><br />The one place I think the book suffered is the conflict between Toranaga and Blackthorne. Toranaga obviously respects Blackthorne's knowledge of the outside world and his desire to learn more about Japan, but Toranaga is a schemer and he sometimes secretly does things that hinder or hurt Blackthorne. Since I liked both Toranaga and Blackthorne it was hard to choose which one I wanted to come out ahead in these moments. This is a small complaint but it is the reason I rate Shogun 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />In the end, if you are interested in history, this is a great book that shows the clash of European empire building as it begins to go up against the Asian countries and the early internal history of Japan.

1446249182|3|It seems thorough where it touches different topics but maybe a little too much information to grasp. You have to digest information in steps.
B00005JNQ8|4|The Interpreter ***<br /><br />Cast: Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, Curtiss I'Cook<br /><br />Director: Sydney Pollack<br /><br />Running Length: 2:08<br /><br />MPAA Classification: PG-13<br /><br />Silvia Broome (Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations.  Late one night, when returning to her sound booth to retrieve belongings, she overhears a plot to kill Edmond Zuwanie (Cameron), president of the fictional Africal country of Matobo when he appears at the United Nations to give a speech.  Broome is originally from Matobo, and has lost the majority of her family to a landmine.  When she overhears the assassination plans, she is spotted, and becomes a target for the assassins too.<br /><br />Secret Service agents Tobin Keller (Penn) and Dot Woods (Keener) are called in to investigate what Silvia has to say.  They are skeptical at first, but given her dislike for Zuwanie, it seems doubtful that she would make the story up.  Tobin comes with some baggage himself, having recently lost his family in an accident.  They begin to form a bond of sorts, and he takes on the role of her protector.<br /><br />\\"The Interpreter\\" is an entertaining and timely political thriller.  Zuwanie is a dictator who started out good, but became corrupted by power.  He enforced a purge of his opposition, and killed many innocents in the crossfire.<br /><br />Kidman and Penn give their usual excellent performances.  The story is top notch, providing action, suspense, and even some thought.  It is effective because it is grounded in the reality of today's world.  It does not cheat or go for an overly happy ending.  This is a good, solid movie and well worth checking out.

B0000WN0ZK|3|I am not a film student. I do not watch movies to gain some deep philosophical insight.  I am open minded, however, and do not restrict my movie going experience to the latest drivel that Hollywood is churning out.  That is the reason that I viewed this DVD twice.  First on my own, then with the help of the commentary track.  Here are my observations. <br /> <br />I found myself scratching my head and/or yawning while watching the first time.  What's up with the mimes in the jeep?  What's the point of the antique shop/propeller?  How did we get into this bizarre Yardbirds concert?  Tennis anyone? <br /> <br />I must say that the film was more enjoyable with the help of the commentary and the previous viewing.  Although even the commentator couldn't explain the mimes, antique shop or propeller.   <br /> <br />My final assessment is that Antonioni was trying to make a commercial abstract film, which is an oxy-moron.  Not enough of either to make this a success.  Am I glad I saw it? Yes.  Do I want to see it again? No way.

0960191038|2|I've been in management consulting for four years have have met several consultants who swear by this book.  Many firms purchase this book for their new consultants and incorporate it in their training.<br />Unfortunately, I have not met a single consultant who has been able to accurately describe or apply the concepts in the book!  Most consultants who swear by the Minto Principle are actually not applying it, but rather applying a simplified (mis)-interpretation of the Principle.  Also, even professional communication experts that my consulting firm employed could not apply the Principle in their training program in a consistent and logical fashion.<br />I agree with the reader from Hong Kong.  The Minto Principle is extremely hard to learn, which I think lessens its value to the average reader.  This is not to say that it does not work.  However, I think you would be better off simply using the principles of good writing you should have learned in school.  (Contrary to what some consulting partners want to believe, there is nothing intrinsically special about business writing that requires new skills.)<br />The book has gotten a lot of mileage out of the McKinsey mystique (it must be good because it was written by a former McKinsey consultant and is used by McKinsey).  Many consultants expound the Minto Principle to make themselves seem superior (i.e. they are using a McKinsey concept).  Save your money.  The book is not worth anywhere near its $95 price.  At best, it's a $11.95 paperback.
B00C5R7F8G|4|A lot of detail but a good read. As a person who grew up during the Cold War, ex military with a father who worked at a Nike base I do not need much to recall those scary days (as my father would say: duck, cover and kiss your butt good bye) and I think everyone of us worried about the Russians but knew that an accident might be the event that triggered the end of the world as we know it. This book should serve as a reminder to those who grew up in the 60's and 70's and should be a must read for those who did not. It is scary to think that we have a generation of people who think that nukes are from the Cold War and who really do not understand the risks and ramifications of our nukes and or those in others hands especially in today's world of terrorism, unstable economies, governments and religious states all with nukes and the globalization of the technology to make and deliver them.
B00MILGR6A|5|I was really pumped when I first heard there was going to be a reboot of the TMNT franchise! I'm not as interested in the newer cartoons, because they are,....well, they just aren't the same as what I enjoyed as a kid. That being said,...these turtles look NOTHING like the ones in the original films. I originally thought this was a bad thing. However, having watched it, they appear far more &#34;hero&#34; like in their new forms. I took my little buddy to watch it (8 years old) and he loved it too! There are a couple of curse words, but nothing very bad. I felt that the creators got the personalities down FAR better in this version than the previous ones. It made you remember they were teenagers. The ONLY complaint I have is the fact that Shredder looked more like he belonged in the Transformers movies than Ninja Turtles. It seems to me they WAY over thought his look and it just came off as too much(IMO). Other than that, I couldn't recommend this more!<br /><br />Final Verdict: WATCH IT! Then BUY IT whenever it is released!
B00A2AHU2E|5|best movie ever !
B007DIQC90|5|its not often that i buy a CD after just hearing one or 2 of the songs but i had to have this one and i am obsessed. I've been listing to nothing else for the last 3 days. every song is great and the lyrics and how they sing is like nothing I've heard before. such emotion. cant wait to hear the next CD they come out with. would love to see them live. get this CD. you will not be disappointed.
B00BB3UYS8|5|Surprisingly, I've found that this book has become a part of my own journey.  Months, sometime years, pass by while life's teachings integrate themselves with ones soul.  Then, out of nowhere, something will pop up to awaken and reinforce those past teachings.  This book is one of those tools.  There are so many layers of reality to life, and I've always felt that fiction  always finds its roots in reality, whether it's the past, present or future.

B00005ASHM|5|Pet Sounds is from 1966; one year before The Beatles Sgt. Pepper album was released. Pet Sounds also uses various instruments that are played throughout the songs, making for some listening experience. It is one of the best albums ever. The 1999 edition has extra songs and mixes. Some of my favorites are \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"I Know There's An Answer\\", \\"Here Today\\", \\"Pet Sounds\\", and \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\".

B00R3DODWI|3|I would have loved to rank this movie by one more star than I did with Desolation of Slog-I mean Smaug, but once again we are served with another missed opportunity. As I left the 2D showing, I kept thinking of the could-have-beens and why-was-that-in-theres more than the actual highlights. (minor spoilers to follow)<br /><br />Immediate Highlights:<br />1. Watching Smaug in action. A long awaited scene that needed to be in the story sooner.<br />2. Viewing Dain Ironfoot, voiced by the always wonderful Billy Connolly, mounted on his battle boar and proclaiming to an army of elves to \\"sod off!\\" So far, the best sounding Dwarf in live action cinema.<br />3. Watching Beorn leap off of his eagle mount to transform into his bear form then start crushing orcs.<br />4. Watching Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond do battle with the ghosts of a familiar enemy to save Gandalf. This segment was a love letter to Tolkien book and movie fans as a set up for the forth coming Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br /><br />Then, Immediate Let downs:<br />1. Finding out that Dain Ironfoot, Dwarf and all, was complete CGI. I know it would have been hard to get Billy Connolly to put on Dwarf makeup and clothing for very little screen time, but that would have been awesome! When you see the dwarf model interact, it both looks good (like Blizzard Entertainment good) but awkward with real actors.<br />2. Not seeing Beorn kill Bolg, the spawn of Azog. Instead, we see #&$%ing Legolas steal the show one more time. I don't have particular issues with Legolas, well, being Legolas. But I do have an issue that Peter Jackson HAD to have him included THIS much in the Hobbit trilogy. The bout on the crumbling CGI bridge wasn't as fun to me than imagining watching Beorn crushing Bolg.<br />3. Random relationships are assumed then cut off like they didn't matter for this ending. Thorin and Bilbo have an amazing \\"Broship\\" that feels more random than progressed into. So when a certain scene happens, it was hard for me to FEEL the emotional betrayal or loss. Instead I scratched my head feeling perplexed. Tauriel and Kili's love for each other feels even more pointless here. In fact, the idea that Tauriel was brand new and created by Jackson, I honestly was hoping her to die to help personify the tragedy of love for each other...since you know, she was never in the book material. Nope, we see her degraded from the needed strong female character into a stereotypic trope.<br />There are more I could name off, but here is the number one let down: it's not of this movie in particular, but<br />4. Realizing that they could EASILY added the Smaug attacking Laketown then dying by Bard's arrow in the second movie instead of waiting till the third. If only, I mean ONLY they had cut out the slog that was in the Desolation of Smaug and added that segment into it, I would  regarded the second Hobbit movie as one of the strongest in the whole franchise. But no, we had to have an unneeded cat and mouse CGI roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Overall, The Battle of Five Armies, to me, was more entertaining than The Desolation of Smaug.  The main feat that you pay to see is entertaining to watch even though it can get muddled with CGI and over the top fight scenes. And like Peter Jackson, some fights are just too overdrawn. But, portions like the legions of orcs pouring through holes sculpted out by huge rock worms, I'll admit I was purely entertained. You have to prepare yourself that this is called \\"the Battle of the Five Armies\\" for a reason. Most of the movie literally is a battle...and mini battles that can wear out their welcome. If you have invested this far, and you are an absolute fan of Middle Earth book or movie, then by all means finish this trilogy at the theater.  The ending itself is not as like the infamous \\"many endings\\" that Return of the King portrayed. This time it was nice and sweet and got to the point as you could truly end this one and dive right into the Lord of the RingsTrilogy. I just wished there wasn't so much slog to get through though.<br /><br />** When the inevitable extended edition rolls out, I will probably have a separate review. I'll admit I am hoping there is more added before Bilbo packs up and heads out.**ough though.    ** When the inevitable extended edition rolls out, I will probably have a separate review. I'll admit I am hoping there is more added before Bilbo packs up and heads out.**

B0040UAYI4|5|[[VIDEOID:mo2HL4DPMMRA1EN]]I've been a PC online gamer from the days of the original Day of Defeat, CS and Medal of Honor Allied Assault. I belong to a gaming group and used to compete in online tournaments. I finally got tired of the hackers, the lack of support for the PC, having to spend hundreds of dollars on upgrades each year, so I am trying to transition to console gaming. I couldn't do it. I was horrible! I figured there had to be something out there which would allow me to use a keyboard and mouse and then I found the Eagle Eye Controller.     I'm trying to spread the word to my fellow PC gamers about this product because it is great!
B0051ANPZQ|5|This is a breath taking book about a kid named August who is deformed and he goes to school for the first time. This is such a unique book becuse it doesn't just tell it from August's perspective but from everyones.

Whoever doesn't like this book is nuts.
B00H8XF9I0|2|If you did not see my pre-release comments, I think this set can be best described as a music industry version of New Coke. Corporates in fancy suits have decided to create a new product to replace the old, while attempting to brainwash the general product that the new is so superior, that they will forget and no longer need the old. As with the New Coke corporates, those at Apple and Universal totally failed to consider what the majority of consumers really wish as well as desire. The public backlash started almost immediately with New Coke, and from the majority of reviews posted so far, the same seems to be happening here.
B00CH26TL8|2|Doesn't do much  for me.  Also can't figure out what some of the scrolls are and other icons.  Maybe I just don't understand the whole premise of the game.
B00FKF0F3C|3|Was disappointed in this book. I lived through most of that history and thought it was handled lightly by the author.. References to Jack Kennedy was shallow and not needed.  Follett's earlier books have been thrilling reads.  This ones Not so much.!

B003Z49LYO|4|If you like novels or movies surrounding the late 1800's to early 1900's with romance, heart break, and all the emotions we as human beings are prone to, you'll like this movie very much. Although I would have chose a different ending to the story, it was still worth watching.

B000000WJ2|3|When Keith's two solo records came out , (especially the first), the comparison to Mick's solo efforts made Keith's seem to be works of genius. A lot of time gone by has put this stuff into the broader perspective of Stones work in general ,and specifically, the best Stones stuff. Keith's hoarse voice seemed soulful at first, now it just seems limited...the band tracks  have a rawness that at first gave me the feeling of being on the inside of the process, but now it's time for them to be more finished, and of course, they never -can- be....The real shame is that, while Mick records can , for the most part, be ignored, Keith's can not, because they could have been great Stones records, with a little more work, and course, the Stones.

B006IVBSBU|4|The movie opens in an airport lounge where an obviously ill Beth Emhoff, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is on the phone with her husband Mitch, played by Matt Damon.  Somewhere in the world the wrong pig met the wrong bat and a new, highly contagious strain of deadly virus was born.  Unknowingly, Beth is its first victim, infected while on a business trip.  Within hours of her arrival home in Minneapolis, people who came into contact with her are either dead or dying and thousands of others around the world have become infected.  Samples have been collected and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization whose job it is to figure out what in the world is happening.    The world is unprepared for this lethal virus.  By day 18, the severity of the outbreak is clear and the social structure starts to deteriorate.  Cities are quarantined, curfews imposed, the dead are buried in mass graves, food is in short supply, and riots erupt.  With no vaccine and no protection and a 25% mortality rate, the scenario is definitely worst case.  Laurence Fishburne plays Dr. Ellis Cheever, the presiding CDC official everyone turns to for reassurance and answers.    We've seen similar scenarios many times on film but not quite in this way.  In \\"Contagion,\\" the science takes center stage.  The science is spot on, it's as real as it gets, and the scientists and researchers are portrayed as the heroes they really are.  The movie accurately portrays how they do their jobs, how passionate they are, how they personally react to a scary situation and how extraordinarily tough and dangerous the work is.  The pressure is intense.  The truth is scary.  From all the experts, it's all a matter of when, not if.    How do the people involved in disease investigations mitigate the damage as quickly as possible?  How do they communicate the threat without causing fear and panic?  How much information is the public entitled to know?  How do they handle misconceptions and disinformation which can spread like a disease on the web? As Dr. Sanjay Gupta puts it in the bonus section, \\"information itself is a transmissible disease.  It can cause a lot of damage.  It spreads very, very quickly and in some cases people can die from it.\\"  I was both entertained and informed.  To be forewarned is to be forearmed.  What more can I ask for from a movie?  It's definitely worth a look.
B00ET0PZDO|4|Rather than escaping on large room with multiple walls, you spend the game escaping simple rooms with only one room.  Some people will find this version too easy, but it is quick fun.
B007IXWL2C|4|I heard a lot about the Fifty Shades Trilogy before I read it. People made it sound rauchy. I found each book to be engaging and well written. It's not a cheap I've read all three books which in and of itself is a testament to the quality of the content. I've gleaned some words of wisdom and insight into the effects of child abuse as well as just being entertained.
0385737955|4|I read the trilogy on vacation. It's entertaining and a fun read. I felt like it's the hunger games trilogy written for guys, a lot less emotional torture in the love triangle.
B0090SI3GQ|5|Yup, held up on my small screen, just as well as it did on the big screen in all its glory. IMO, an improvement over the first Captain America. Plus, I'm a fan of Marvel's: Agent Carter on the small screen as well.

B004MC8CA2|5|It is a great concept to have access to the word. Being able to read on the go while being able to change the fonts at any given moment.
B00B0ZT9NI|5|I think we should watch the movie for its content and rethink the event for its outcome.  The movie is Ben's best work.  The event was the CIA at its finest.  At one point, the CIA agent could have abandon the project and gone home on his own.  Not sure what the Iranians would have done at that point.  This is perhaps a story that should have stayed buried in the CIA archives.  Instead, it becomes one more excuse for the Iranians to hate the USA.  I liked the movie so well that I have ordered the blu-ray disc.....tag

B004WR125O|2|The UWF-1 initially worked flawlessly, but then one day - poof - no signal. The device is still talking to the stereo as the MAC address updates with it in or out but its lost all of its wifi mojo. I dont want to buy another one of these to replace it as there is no reason that it wont also stop after 3 months. I dont want to gamble on the other reviewers using the 3rd party devices, so its back to wired connections until Onkyo release a better wifi product.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I should have updated this sooner, but I was so pleased that it worked again, I forgot. The bottom line is that the N755 system requires all of the wifi details to be re-entered, even though it appears to have them all already. It is not in any manual that this is needed, and it seems quite unlikely that it will make any difference, but it worked. I believe the wifi adaptor lost its mind when I used a USB in the front of the N755, but whatever the cause, the adpator still works and im still streaming. So beware, before throwing this little device away, it will be good practice to re-enter all of your network details.<br />by the way, I never heard from Onnkyo customer service despite trying to contact them several times. Dont count on them to help.

0439023483|4|I've been hearing good things about The Hunger Games for a couple of years now, and I always meant to read it, but never got the chance. Now that the final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay, is about to make its way into anxious fans' hands at midnight release parties across the country, I figured it was time to start the series and see if it lived up to all the hype.    The story takes place in an undetermined future where Panem, \\"the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America\\", and its central Capitol rules over 12 outlying Districts, each of which is required to send one boy and one girl each year to participate in The Hunger Games. Broadcast nation-wide, the Games feature the 24 \\"tributes\\" battling to the death, with the winner being set for life, and bringing wealth and glory back to their District.    We follow Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District 12, as she is thrust into the games, and fights, literally and figuratively, to stay alive, and to somehow show the Capitol that the people are not totally at their mercy.    On the positive side, I read three-quarters of book in one day; it's written that well. The story moves quickly, and had enough action and little \\"twists\\" to keep it interesting. The world of The Hunger Games, and it's 12 Districts, is well fleshed-out, even though most of our interaction is with just a few characters.    The negative side isn't so much a negative per se, it's just a matter of perceptions; it's very much a \\"young adult\\" novel. Don't get me wrong; I love YA fiction, some of my favorite post-apocalyptic books are YA. But you have to realize going in that some of the details of the story may be \\"smoothed over\\" so to speak, and there may be elements of the plot that don't seem very realistic, but are necessary for the story to progress.    For example, the District where Katniss lives has been sending two of it's children to die every year for 75 years. But there's no talk of families trying to flee, or anguished mothers wailing in grief as their child's name is called at the Reaping. And after being chosen, Katniss, and the other tributes, don't seem to be really taking the situation seriously. If I knew I had barely a few weeks to live, and was likely to die a horrible death, I'd be haunted, and would devote every waking moment to planning and strategizing. Katniss and the other characters acknowledge that they're not likely to win the Games, but almost seem to brush off that fact. And the interaction between Katniss and the Gamemakers and the Capitol is a bit simplistic and contrived.    But like I said, as long as you know going in what you're likely to get, none of that really matters. Even though you know the chances of a 16 year old girl challenging a long-standing dystopic government hover around zero, you can still cheer for her each time she's able to stick it to them, however unlikely it would be. You can enjoy it simply as an action story where the underdog makes good, and where personal independence trumps the evil Big Brother government.    So even though I doubt that when I get to book 3, I'm going to think of it as \\"the end of an era\\", I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series, and seeing what happens to Katniss and those around her.
B002VECM72|5|Great purchase to start my Blu-ray collection.
B00005N5S5|5|This was the most innovative movie I've seen in a long time (and proof is the 3 sequels that followed it).  There's a lot of joking about Arnold Schwarzenegger's non-acting (&#34;I'll be back&#34; ) is the most emotive line he's got. But the movie conveyed pure menace and an innovative plot line that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I'd classify this with other action-movie-icons of the last 50 years (Bullet, Great Escape, Dirty Harry, Rocky, and Raiders of the Lost Ark)-- over the years, and sequels, the special effects have gotten better, but original stories -- no one's going to beat those.

B000BNNLN4|4|Marina Lewycka has written an intriguing novel about an aged father, his two warring daughters, his December-May marriage, and his treatise on tractors.  Two years after the death of their mother, the daughters have to join forces to save their father from his much younger, green-card seeking wife, whom they are convinced is using him, and may be abusing him.   <br />Nadia, the younger, resents Vera's deathbed pressure on their mother to alter her will in Vera's favor, but that's only the most recent excuse for them to be at odds.  There are also family secrets to be revealed about their parents' courtship and marriage, and the years spent in a labor camp before liberation and a new life in England.  Vera was the war child; Nadia the peace child, and no one will tell her what happened there and why her father is so angry with Vera.   <br />Lewycka explores whether or not the truth is always what one needs to hear.  She has a talent for bringing out the humor amid the pathos of the declining health and life of the father, and the senseless ongoing battle between the daughters.  I found a similarity to Ann Tyler in the plot and style of writing, which is not a bad thing.

B0086700CM|3|The game is absolutely awesome, addicting and fun to play to pass time. But, the lag is horrible, and the longer I've had it on my phone, the worse it gets. It crashes randomly in the middle of my game, doesn't respond to certain swipes, or reaponds wrongly to others. It's fun, but the issues it has makes it annoying to play.
B00688628M|5|Fantastic story-telling, and a reasonable depiction of war. It wasn't overly gruesome or graphic, but the panic, the horror, and the hardship the soldiers of the 101st went through was well represented. The acting and special effects were very good, and the pace was right on target. From what I can tell by using the internet, the events and people depicted were also about as historically accurate as you can get with a Hollywood-type production.
B000002U82|5|This album incorporates everything an escapist rocker needs, its got wailing guitars coupled with dreamy synthesizer sounding effects. This is the BEST psychedelic record ever! If you are curious as to how psychedelic music sounds just skip all those other records and go to the heart of it all with this masterpiece of rock. This is a classic ingenous album thats beautiful. The lyrics are some of the most intelligent while still maintaining a &quot;crazy&quot; side. Anyways this is Highly Reccomended!

I dare you to say Mama while looking in a mirror after you watch this.... if you do, look around and see what shows up.  Try not to scream out.

B000QFAJ7S|3|This is good but not as great as Breakaway. I love Kelly Clarkson though. She is a naturally tallented singer. I suggest that she concentrate on the type of songs she is adept in. She can sing inserts if she wishes. By this I mean she can do the way Michael Jackson does. He is a pop singer but in his CD he can sing rock or R&B.
B004MC8CA2|4|I really like the different Bible versions - wish I could download the NIV. The devotional plans are neat but seem a bit sluggish in response and updates
B002NZK5TG|5|This movie is a must see. One of the best movie remakes of all time. Our yearly Halloween tradition :-)
B00CPTUN5G|5|it is great for kids. As a mother it teaches sharing and frandship. I like as a grown up too.
B00JDB4PEY|5|I am so grateful to Antoino Reid & Timbaland, Darkchild and whoever else is responsible for this remarkable project.  It definately sheds a BRIGHT light on the legacy of Michael who I was a childhood idol.  I love all eight tracks and right now I am stuck on Loving You and August is approaching.  Hopefully, the radio will catch the bug and put it in heavy rotation, it is family and club friendly.  It is such a heart warming dance track and I can't get enough.  Blue Gangsta is starting to pull at me as well.  My heart is full and I am so greatful to have enjoyed his music for decades and will continue until .............. R.I.P. Michael
B00H57OXSG|5|This movie is funny at times but it is not a comedy. It blooms into a very poignant statement. It was brilliantly portrayed by all in the movie. I do not want to give away too much but it is heart wrenching and heart warming to watch because you know what is coming and what gladly does not come.
B0031KC8OC|5|I love this show, It's smart, Funny, suspenseful and just an all around great show.  Too bad it didn't stick around longer.
B002LFAHBO|5|We HAVE to watch this movie every year during the holiday season at least once. I actually had to buy a new copy of if this year because we wore out the previous one!! By the end of the movie my husband and I are both sobbing our hearts out just like we did the very first time we watched it. Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy,.....every performance in this movie is awesome...Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman...I was planning on giving this new Blu-ray version to my husband on Christmas Eve but I think I'm going to have watch it right now....and the soundtrack is great too!!!

B00J3V97NS|5|I am very happy how fast it got to me and the quality is very good
B007MDB71O|5|I had never read the books before I saw this movie.  Seeing the film, I was highly motivated to quit procrastinating and read them.  I think the film was far, far, better than the box office would indicate, and deserved a lot more attention, and let's face it, love, from Disney.<br /><br />This was a great start to what should be a really awesome series.<br /><br />Please Disney, make the rest of the series!
076790592X|5|This is a beautiful, life-changing, life-affirming book. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a story that will make the reader rethink his or her relationships and can be the start of a healing process for estranged families. The enthusiasm for life that this man has is astounding and incredibly uplifting. His philosophy is that each day we wake up is a gift from God, so what do we do with a gift? Do we celebrate, honor and cherish it or defile, ignore and take it for granted? Morrie never loses his dignity because he never loses his love and appreciation of that gift. This is a book to treasure and re-read whenever we've had a bad day and buy plenty to keep on hand for gifts.
B006RXQ8RI|5|It's another of Quintin Tarintino great movies  along with Pulp fiction<br />I highly recommend this series 1 and 2 if your  a fan of his movies , he has his own way of getting things done  but truly unique in itself

They should get their funny bones checked, not to mention their heads examined.<BR>To those people who have seen this movie more than a few times:  Watch it will someone who has never seen it before-you almost feel sorry for them because you sit with them and they are laughing at something, like Otto swinging Archie out of a window, but little do they realize that Archie is about to run around the same apartment with his underware on his face.<BR>John Cleese, whereever you are-you are a genius.
B005544TRQ|3|Oksy, but actors are too stillted.
B000HT3PPG|5|I actually watched the black and white version of the movie.  The color version is included in this two disc set however.  The &#34;special features&#34; included really blew me away.
B0058VW36U|4|the grandkids play this one and enjoy it
B009ACK0T0|4|I was disappointed that the case was cracked. It was a birthday gift. The disc is ok. Movie Mars is going to replace the case. Which the recipient of the gift is happy about. The movie is excellent which is why my daughter wanted it.
B0051QIGP4|1|I hate most of todays pop music, but every once and then there are a few songs or artist that come along with some catchy songs and grab my attention. I am not a big Ga-Ga fan, in fact I am not very familar with most of her material, but I have heard some of her other releases, and some of it is pretty good. Some is over the top cheese for me, but she has a good voice and uses some interesting samples and grooves that are very catchy. I downloaded this release thinking that I could always just dump some of the songs I didnt want, but I wound up dumping all but ONE song. Folks, this is a very bad effort. I dont know what she was thinking, but this all seems \\"Rushed\\" Every single track seems to use the same beat or sample, and the vocal seems like it it 10x oversampled, with the I just ran my great voice through a vocal processor so know it sounds like almost everyone else that does it in the world of todays pop. With a huge fan base, and albums that fly off the shelves, why this? Why does this seem like its dumbed down and sounds like most of todays garbage. I guess everyone is entitled to have bad albums. Some greats have had some duds like Led Zeppelin and the Who, but..at least you could get some good songs off the bad albums, this is just B.A.D...and I am hoping that Lady doesnt decide to go with this style for her next albums. She's got some talent, no doubt, but thsi is just wasted..Avoid this, your not missing anything here at all.
0465068367|4|Great book. Very indepth.
B0081KTI0E|4|Much better than I thought it would be. Not sure I can ever really see Daniel Radcliffe as anyone but Harry Potter, but I thought he was good in this film, and it was scary!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Nice calculator.  Simple to use and easy to read.  This is nothing fancy, but that's the beauty of it.  I love it.
B00KX4TORI|5|Works very well
B0092QITO2|5|I had no real expectations about this movie, but came away impressed. I am a huge fan of science fiction films, but not enough to keep watching if the particular movie is absolutely atrocious or doesn't hold my interest. Fortunately, that wasn't the case at all here.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed was the very well-done backdrop upon which the story takes place. This isn't another sci-fi movie set on a sparsely populated desert or jungle planet with some aliens and laser guns thrown in to make it futuristic, or on some generic small space station in tight corridors. Nope, you see the whole Earth, big cityscapes, giant intra-planetary elevators connecting the hemispheres, dingy retro-futuristic slums, and much more, all brought to life with surprising attention to detail and style. And yeah, it really looks good.<br /><br />Contrasting the previous incarnation of the film, the action doesn't take place on Mars, but on a post-nuclear war Earth with the two remaining governments existing in radiation-free zones in Europe and Australia. The British/European colony is your typical futuristic Utopia with a dirty little secret, while Australia / &#34;The Colony&#34; is portrayed as much grittier and darker. It's not quite dystopian per se, but it has a grungy mega-city feel clearly inspired by Blade Runner and maybe with a little bit of the &#34;Dredd&#34; remake aesthetic thrown in. This dichotomy brings to mind another recent film, Upside Down, which also had gorgeous visuals, but of a twin-planet system where the &#34;Up Above&#34; world was a veritable Utopia that fed off the poor, working class world of &#34;Down Below.&#34;  However, while Upside Down focused more on a dramatic love story and the clever - if implausible - premise, Total Recall is all about the action.<br /><br />That action does not disappoint. There's a great exposition in the beginning, showing off and establishing the world and backstory, and introducing us to Colin Farrell's role as Quiad the factory worker. Once the inevitable secret is slipped, great chase and fight scenes abound, interspersed by segments which build on the story and add a decent (but not &#34;thriller&#34;-worthy) amount of suspense and mystery. As can be expected, CGI is highly utilized for the action, but it's well done and never feels like it's there just to exist.<br /><br />The story is a fresh take on the original, but to me was just as appealing. The political and social overtones are there, but honestly aren't any more obvious than in something like, say, the original RoboCop (still haven't seen the remake of that one), which was very well received. Though I won't spoil it, the mystery behind the &#34;original&#34; Quaid and who he was/is kept me guessing literally til the end. The acting was also well done, bringing life to the story. Colin Farrell was particularly entertaining to watch. as he is good with the character-driven parts and very convincing with subtleties in his performance during the action. As a factory worker, Quaid knows he &#34;shouldn't&#34; know all these crazy action moves he is performing, and seems continually surprised by himself as his former-self's reflexes and hidden knowledge keep his present-self alive. All of the supporting roles are well played as well, with lots of big names offering quality acting, even when the script isn't the most outstanding.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this rendition of Philip K Dick's original story. I am more surprised than anything, really, because I had heard it was a very mediocre reboot, but as far as sci-fi action films go, I don't think you could ask for anything more. It combines visuals almost as beautiful as those in the sappy &#34;Upside Down&#34; with a backstory almost as clever as the one in &#34;Source Code&#34; with better action than either. I would highly recommend at least giving this iteration a try, for fans of action, adventure, or science fiction movies.<br /><br />One thing tonote was that the copy I ordered in early March 2014 had one short potion of the sound and dialogue completely out of sync with the picture. It was near the beginning and the issue was cleared in a couple of minutes, but it was still annoying. I'm thinking of asking for an item exchange, but I'm not sure if it's just on my copy or others as well, and honestly it may not even be distracting enough to be worth the return hassle.
B006AZZPCM|1|this app sucks on the kindle fire it says download  or watch but when you click watch it sayd error or unavailable  video even when you try downloading it it does the same thing i hate it dont get it<br /><br />and once again it is a PEICE OF CRAP!!!!
B00M7UTFW0|5|Intriguing and intense. Thee best picture of the year, so far. Bound to be a classic.
B004FGMDOQ|4|Different from what I usually read and maybe that's what I liked about it!  Sometimes you can get stagnant n bored so this was a refreshing, funny n entertaining ride!!  Harry Potter genre n I am not a HP fan but I would recommend this book to young n old alike!
B00DF0ZP8Y|3|I thought this would play the entire let it go song per the description but it only plays about 7 seconds of the instrumentals. Its ok I guess.
B00L33TB9E|2|I found the enjoyment of playing the game was not long lived enough to justify the time spent learning the mechanics of play.  Good idea, just not end user friendly unless you like working to play a game.
B005JTAP4S|5|I think the other reviewers have described the content and the story quite well. So I'll just add that this is gripping and exciting story which isn't just for children. It's dark enough to entertain anyone looking for some really great escapist tale-telling. Beautifully Written and Brilliantly Executed.
0066621003|3|Good to Great by Jim Collins was written in 2001 and was a huge success selling over two million copies. It is a breezy work about how few good companies make the leap to becoming great. It was an enjoyable book when I received it at a business workshop. This 300 page book has 9 chapters in it. While it has aged somewhat Jim's message is quite good. He talks about getting the right people on the bus and the wrong ones off. He identifies eleven companies: Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreen's, and Wells Fargo. Competitors for each company were given profiles to determine the characteristics of companies that break through to huge success.<br /><br />Jim's message is simple and his research is quite good. Since I devour financial information I appreciated the research but when I went to re-read it I found it quite long-winded. I can't say I learned many new things but what I did learn was concise, accurate and informative. Many people in my circle of influence were affected by the ideas presented. My only complaints are that there are a few too many examples and not enough specific recommendations. Jim could have provided more of an action plan or reduced the size of the book. Some parts are written a little bit too casually. In some ways, everyone should read it once because the advice does make sense. It is a surprisingly easy read. Collins adds a few metaphors into the conversation such as \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" and the \\"tortoise and the fox\\" analogy. Overall, many business leaders consider this the bible of people management. It could use an update now but the research is accurate as of the book's printing.
B00JBGWP3Y|1|I am not Christian, nor do I believe the bible is literally factual. However, to take a tale from the Bible, intentionally, and twist it about so that it is the OPPOSITE of what it was meant to be... GOD commanded them TO repopulate the Earth. On here, he forbade it. Why? That makes no sense. God wanted the Earth to be populated with &#34;his people&#34;. This is one of many grave mis-tellings and mockeries. I do not appreciate ANY faith being so disrespected.
B00NEQRNVG|4|Absolute must read!!!!!!! Can not wait to hear more of this story! Gideon is fabulous even with his issues. Worth reading.
B005Z271Y6|5|Adele has an amazing voice but I guess she can do a little bit more than stand in front of the audience or sit on a chair...
B00EIL7E9C|5|SEASON SIX WAS ONE OF THE BEST. I LOVE EVERY EPISODE. I HATE THAT THERE WAS ONLY 10 EPISODES INSTEAD OF THE 12 WE USUALLY  GET. I ALSO HATE THE FACT THAT NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE LAST SEASON OF TRUE BLOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WATCH WHEN TRUE BLOOD ENDS.
B006ZCWU5K|2|I find the music to be tired and out of touch. Bruce speaks about the working man and all his problems as if it is forty years ago instead of now. He speaks of the banker getting fat while the working man gets thin. It sppears that Bruce is one of the fat cats and he is out of touch with the working people that made him famous and inspired him for so many years. As a life long fan. I believe it is time for him to get back to his roots and perhaps talk to the people he seems to champion. Sorry, but this ain't 1980. I see no spark or \\"anger\\" as many have attested to, only an artist that wants to make more money while doling out nothing extraordinary. I give it a two only because it's Bruce.
B000O179EA|1|I bought this movie on HD DVD because I am one of the few people with an HD DVD player.  You can get them really cheap so I figured, why not?  It had pretty good reviews - it was worth 4 or 5 bucks.  Boy was I wrong!  This movie was absolutely stupid beyond belief.  The special effects were weak and the ghosts were obnoxiously over the top characters.  The love connection was also totaly unbelievable.  stay away from this movie - don't waste your four bucks on it.  Go enjoy a newspaper and a latte instead.  You will be happier in the end.
B00B2V66VS|1|every time I get a new high score and try to save myself it freezes and exits the game!!! I'm soooo pissed right now!!!!
B004J88SGC|2|Let me preface by saying that the primary reason we bought this concert DVD was, we were so impressed by Billy Joel's performance at the Sandy benefit concert. He was amazing at that concert, so we assumed he would be equally great at this concert, which was recorded in 2008. Wrong!!! The vocals were odd and frankly unpleasant, one viewing was enough, we gave the DVD away!!! Maybe there's a great Billy Joel performance DVD out there, but this ain't it!!
0451228731|5|Suarez has created a near future world that instead of an Edward Snowden blowing the whistle on the fascist police state military-industrial complex, a billionaire decides to do something about it - by direct action. Wildly imaginative and terrifying. You won't know who are the good guys for a considerable number of pages and just like real life there are some on both sides of the conflict. Highly recommended.
B00OY0G2LI|1|This claims to charge iPhones and iPads, but it will not fit the charging port of either device for any generation product ever made.
B000HC2LI0|4|Its a beautiful set, the show is great, no problems to report.  I highly recommend the show, you need to see it though in progression, its hard to pick it up if you are joining it somewhere in the middle of the building plot of each season
B00IKZX1ZI|4|I like it because it gives challenges in dexterity and focus for us older folks. Keeps the mind busy, while watching TV. Trying to stay my mind as young as I can.
B00192KCQ0|5|This is one of the BEST Metallica CD's. It's like return to The Black album! I couldn'r believe it, I thought it was another St. Anger, even though I was so excited for St. Anger! Thank you for bringing old Metallica back! This is an instant classic!
B003YL4LYI|5|Loved this book so much going on if you watch GOT there is more going on in this book wish the new was out !!
B000QRIGLC|5|I haven't seen the movie yet, I highly doubt it is anywhere near as great as the book. I really enjoyed this and am going to look for books on Army special forces next.

B0025KVLTW|5|The remastered Beatles CDS are out (finally), after a too long wait. If you want to get a quick idea what to expect from the remasterings, the best way to do this is to compair one of the 1987 remastered songs to  your copy of BEATLES ONE (the  number one singles CD from 2000.) The BEATLES ONE was remastered with 24 bit technology, and sound solutions to negate the hiss.  A lot of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR came out on the BEATLES ONE CD, as well as the remastered and remixed soundtrack to YELLOW SUBMARINE. (It included all 15 songs used in some way for the cartoon film.) So, I had misgivings about buying MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR remastered, cos I already had so many of the songs remastered. Nevertheless, i'm really glad I did. The remastering job is just hands down phenominal.  Most of what pops out at you, are the little bits that were too sonically blurred, or buried in the mix, to decipher. The BASS is very punchy, while the top end resonates with much greater clarity and distinction. The ride and crash symbols come across so REAL. My only real disappointment, is that with the purity of the sound we now have, all the problems with bouncing down so often to free up tracks is evident. Its no secret that MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was recorded on four track, like Pepper.  So, because almost ALL the musical instruments ended up crowded onto one track, leaving another track or two for vocals and lead guitar, then a track for the sound effects. (I think Martin wanted the sound effects seperated, like the bus that drives between the speakers on the song MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, to produce that psychedelic movement between the stereo channels.) Sadly, this gives problems in the soundscape that sound very odd to our modern, 48 track hearing. Like having the drums crowded into the left channel, along with the guitars, maracas, keyboards, while the vocals and the Bass, or lead guitar, get stuck in the other channel. Of course, this is why the MONO editions were given such focus, until 8 track recording made the stereo soundscape more balanced.  Still, for clarity, definition, and distinction (like finger cymbals or keyboard parts played low, around middle \\"C\\"), this remastered edition is just fantastic.<br /><br />The other goodies that you get with the REMASTERED version of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, is a VASTY IMPROVED booklet. For those you had the original Vinyl of this album, you know it came with a \\"comic book\\" in the middle, that had lots of photos and these drawings that told the \\"story\\" behind the movie the Beatles made in 1967 called MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. I often wondered WHY they didnt reproduce this booklet in the first CD edition, but the new 38 page booklet finally fixes that problem. IT also has some recording notes, and a mini essay about how this album fits into the Beatles Discography. The layout of the new cardboard CD holder is pretty cool. It opens up into three panels, like a triplyct. The first panel shows the cover, that also holds the thick booklet. The next two inner panels combine to show all four Beatles looking out the top of the Magical Mystery Tour bus (it had a skylight opening). In the third panel you find the CD slipped in, but without a CD \\"record cover\\" as you normally see these \\"Vinyl reproduction\\" gatefold albums, so you need to be careful pulling the CDs out to prevent surface scruffs. When you fold in the gatefold panels, you have outside one panel a full color reproduction of the photograph taken for the SINGLE sleeve of STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER. (The fab 4 with bright floodlights around them, overexposing the film.) All in all, the design and layout are a HUGE improvement on the first CD release. Even the CD itself is printed like the old PARLOPHONE LPs.  And lastly, here's a word about the 3-4 minute mini documentary.  I was worried that my 10 year old MAC may not play it, but the QUICKTIME documentary will play on MACS with G4 or G5 processors, and anything past a OS X.3, or any PC with at least a pentium 3. Themini-doc shows a little bit of the first 5 song's \\"videos\\" from the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR FILM.  While the edited \\"videos\\" play, there's voice overs from the guys, including JOHN's famous statement about this album being his favorite, cos its so wierd, and cos its the album where I AM THE WALRUS was placed.  Paul defends the film, as usual. Then, they continue the voice overs, while you see bits of the promo films for HELLO GOODBYE, PENNY LANE, and STAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER.  As for studio chatter, there's a couple of bits, but not that much.  I didnt own the Magical Mystery Tour DVD, I would have thought much more of this particular mini documentary.  I am certain of one thing. The guys at APPLE wanted to make sure this sound remastering was done right, and would be the LAST WORD in upgrades for a long time. (At least until they do go back and remix from the original four tracks, and put out AUDIO DVDS.  I wouldnt hold your breathe, tho.)<br /><br />All in all, there's enough sound quality improvement here to make it well worth buying. If you dont want to replace your whole BEATLES CD collection, I suggest just buying one of the REMASTERS, just to put your toe in the water.  Even tho I've always loved this album for the songs on it, I'd still buy WHITE ALBUM as a first pick, maybe even ABBEY ROAD. Since they were both recorded on 8 track, there's just that much more clarity, from the lack of bouncing down of tracks. The stereo soundscape was much improved by then as well. But whatever REMASTERED CD you buy, know this: You are hearing EXACTLY what George Martin and the Beatles heard, when they played back the master tapes in ABBEY ROADS studio. For some the sound improvment might only be subtle, but for me, any improvement to the BEATLES catalouge is VAST.  The improved artwork, the quick time documentaries, etc is just icing on the cake.  Who wants cake without icing anyway?shows a little bit of the first 5 song's \\"videos\\" from the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR FILM.

B00ANVX6DY|5|My granddaughter is four and loves all things having to do with a Princess. She has been to DisneyWorld and has met Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. She sometimes is bothered by 'mean characters', but she understands what is reality.<br /><br />In 'Sofia The Princess' Sofia has the voice of Ariel Winter. She is a commoner, living in the Village with her mother. Her mother is beautiful and makes boots. Sofia's mother, Miranda, whose voice is Sara Raminez, marries King Roland II, whose voice is Travis Willingham. Sofia and her mother leave their small Village and move to the Royal Castle where Roland and his children, James, whose voice is Zach Callison and Amber whose voice is Darcy Rose Byrnes. Sofia becomes immersed in the royal life, the Princess lessons, curtsey lessons and all the table lessons at Royal Prep Academy under the guidance of the Three Fairies. These three fairies have shown up in other Disney films and my granddaughter recognized them. Amber, the new stepsister is jealous that everyone who meets Sofia loves her.<br /><br />When Roland announces that he's hosting a dance in Sofia's honor, Sofia worries that she can't dance. Tricks are played upon her, and her feelings are hurt. The magic sorcerer is indeed a meanie and we worry for Sofia. This film offers a lot of action and fun, but also many lessons are learned. For young children this is a wonderful way for them to learn.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant, the songs are rich and delightful, the characters are full and believable. The storyline is perfect for children from 3-90. I enjoyed this film as much as my granddaughter.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-07-13
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Fantasy fun.
B00CWY76CC|5|This game pretty darn great to play it is entertaining tricky fun hard it catches your attention keeps and you playing.
B007HB5TN8|5|I love this book I read it every once in a while. It's well written, you get to know and like the characters. A good read for young and not so young if you like a good love story (not cheesy).
B00AESN8XY|4|Super fun, entertaining, educational, and yet challenging. The only thing I really don't like is how there is DLC... just put it in the paid game FFS.
B00006V9A0|5|If you are a Nirvana fan you must get this album. If you are a fan of alternative, punk, grunge, or rock music, you nust get this album. Every single one of these songs on this album are fascinating. It is one of those C.D.'s where you just can't skip a track. \\"About A Girl\\" is a fast pace song that is off Nirvana's second album. If you like the Beatles' you are sure to like this somg. \\"Been a Son\\" is similar to \\"About a Girl\\". It is fast paced and has a nicebeat to it. \\"Sliver\\" is a great song with a very cool bass intro. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is a really great song. It is an anthem for teenagers around the world today. \\"Come As You Are\\" is also a great song. It has a nice beat and the \\"memoria\\" chants are really soothing. \\"Lithium\\" is a really cool song. It has a nice guitar and bass rythym to it and the words are really catchy. \\"In Bloom\\" is a really great song. Kurt's voice is really great in this song. The drums are magnificent. \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is also a great song. When you first hear the song you think you are going to hear a really slow paced song untill the chorus comes in. This song has a great guitar intro and solo. The drums are remarkable. \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is another song that is just great. It is different from the version heard in IN UTERO. The drums and guitar in tis song are just WOW. \\"Rape Me\\" is a really cool song. It has a great guitar and awesome backing vocals by Dave Grohl in the final \\"rape me\\" chants. \\"Dumb\\" is sord of a stoner song but it is still realy cool. The bass is really good. The final two song's on this album are live from when Nirvana appeared on MTV Unplugged. \\"All Apologies\\" has a really great bass riff and a nice ending vocal riff. \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" is a David Bowie song that the band covered. The intro guitar and solo are breathtaking. They are just great. The first track on this album is \\"You Know You're Right\\". This track is a new track which had never been released. It is a little scary to hear those \\"pain\\" chants from Kurt towards the end and especially the last one. The guitar is great and the drums are just beaten down hard by Dave Grohl. So go buy this album now. It is great. VIVA NIRVANA!
B0011EU0NG|5|Always entertaining no matter how many times we watched it
B0052RDHTM|5|My family emigrated to Canada from the environment described in this book. I absolutely loved the character development and the easy mingling of fiction and fact. Only one character is one dimensional and he continues that way in book two. A terrific read and great insight into the complicated history of the day.
B00BLCHZC2|4|makes you think how it was back then
B00CSR2J9I|5|This game is so cool. I love it I have it on my kindle,phone,and iPad please make more swag games
B00BD99JMW|5|I Loved this trilogy!  A great read from the start of book 1 to book 3. Definitely a must read!
B000UAFDP2|1|The package arrived on time as do most of the movies from Amazon. However when I with great anticipation put the film in my blue ray DVD it stayed on 0000 and the screen was BLANK!!!!! I tried every thing I could with the machine hoping it was a machine malfunction, it was not. The disc was either blank to start with or damaged to start with and when dubed did not take. Either way I do not have a way to view this film in blue ray.
B005GFPZYK|5|Amazing read!  A true American!
B00FAPF5U0|4|I love this game. Even though I don't complete a level on the first try every time, I keep coming back until I make it...not too bad waiting for time to build up. I'm hooked!
B009UX2YAC|5|this game is beyond addictive but its so so so so much fun must buy and why not its free. never gets boring
B00LCT48GA|5|Slash, Myles, Todd, Brent and Elvis (producer) hit a home run with this one. Great tracks.
B00K3N5RWK|1|Because
B003R0MEZ4|5|I have 1 - 5 and so buying 6 was a easy choice.  Its was a smart buy as I love the show and get to watch again and again.  I can recommend to anyone if you love the series purchase the DVDs it worth it.
B00B7Y0206|3|I do like the app, but a big problem with it is that it shut down randomly. I'll be watching a video and it suddenly closes.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Fun to play
0375842209|4|Took me awhile to get used to the writing style and the narrator view, but I really like the story.
B00CJ4OMO0|5|This was a hidden gem on Amazon Prime. Set up the popcorn, dim the lights and darken the room. Turn it up a bit as the start -- music -- adds to the dialog. It's an adventure in good storytelling and it is Peter O'Toole at his finest. Between this, and &#34;My Favorite Year&#34; you'll get a taste of a great actor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie!
B00DR0PDNE|1|DO NOT BUY - literally a piece of rubbish, it is still in beta, wait year for full release, not worth the headache.<br />Choppy video, encountering errors, randomly stopping, no sound etc.<br />again, DO NOT BUY
B000099T2L|5|This is my favorite Beyonce.  My daughter purchased it and I spent so much time listening to it, that when she left for college (with it in her possession) I repurchased it.
B008Y7N7JW|3|The movie is entertaining but not very convincing.  If you have a couple hours to waste, it's not a bad way to do it.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Good for watching TV.
B005K17RU0|5|I love this app! I use it all the time! With my husbands job thid app really helps out! -
B003Q6D25K|5|I'm a horror junkie so it takes a lot to scare me.  Paranormal Activity got to me just a bit.  It's just the juxtaposition of middle class normalcy with a demonic haunting.  Everything is understated and the tension builds to a shattering conclusion.  I had to see PA 2 just to see if they were able to sustain the terror that the first movie had created.  I was not disappointed.  This is actually a prequel to the first movie as you find out at the very beginning.  The filming this time is mostly from home security cameras with a few bits from a hand held camcorder.  Things start slowly with just a few bumps being heard in the night.  The only person to notice anything is the Hispanic nanny who tries to warn the family and cleanse the house of evil spirits.  Of course, no one takes her seriously.  And things begin to get worse (who could have guessed?).  I don't want to give any more away but I will say that this is the first horror movie that I have ever seen which actually scared me so bad, it brought tears to my eyes.  If you have a weak bladder, you should probably wear your Depends.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the last 10-15 minutes of this movie could be dangerous to your health if you have a bad heart.  Of course, it probably didn't help that I went to a midafternoon matinee on the day after Halloween.  There were only 3 other people in the theater.  I had a whole row to myself in a dark and mostly empty theater - believe me, it's not the way you should watch this movie.  It's definitely a worthy successor to Paranormal Activity, in fact, I think it's scarier.  Kudos to the writer(s) and director of these movies.  An original horror movie is a rare thing and they have now given us two.  So, fellow horror fans, don't miss PA 2.
B00HY7VU60|5|GREAT if you are into historical Engilish FICTION.  Yes, many true elements, but also a lot of fiction.  Very fun to watch though.  Great story line, decent acting/dialog.  Great costuming and sets.
B00E8KLWB4|5|A great game to play.The only problem is you don't have a lot of money and energy.still a great way to spend some time.
B003G4W49C|5|This was a great book my husband recommended it. It is a must read for science fiction fans!! It is good for young readers and the characters are deep enough and developed enough for more mature fans don't miss this one.
B00QROI70S|5|Good entertainment.
0812415086|5|I've heard of this writing over my life.  Finally taken the opportunity to read.  Amazing and tragic all at the same time.<br />Wonderful to read from the perspective of a young teen that probably makes everyone one recall youthful times.
B006OOHYIC|5|This game requires the player to think ahead...unlike so many other mindless apps. For once I felt like the game challenged me and forced me to come up with new problem-solving strategies. An awesome practice in thinking out of the box.
B005LJK3AC|2|I can't believe Jennifer Anniston would talk so filthy much less film it for anyone to see. Didn't even watch the whole thing. Threw it in the trash. Though Jason Bateman was great.
020530902X|5|Wonderful book - excellent service.  Thank you!
B00382S9N2|5|BETTER THAN GOOD.  ENJOYED THE BOOK OF PICTURES OF THE MOVIE!!!  THE MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST.
B0009P66TK|5|Love love it!! Keeps great time and looks great! I get lots of Compliments on it!  Invicta good watch for the money
B00FATEJYE|4|I must say, while the updates seem to come from th ios version and often freeze up the game shop, it gets fixed quickly enough. And the over abundance of permissions always makes me weary. But this game is too addicting not to play. Good challenge and fun, lots of cards and heroes, but couldnt hurt expanding and adding the ability to trade/ sell ANY card not just duplicates would give this  afifth star. Great game, half ass developers. 4/5
B00785P2QC|5|Very addictive game but costs too much money if you want to actually get any where. Too expensive to buy the money needed
B002HK9I04|5|Now this South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut in Blu-ray is one very funny film. Not for kids.
B004DM1ZQY|4|Decent game. Nice that two can play live or you can just play the CPU. However, on the more difficult levels when playing the CPU, it's interesting how many doubles it gets compaired to how many you get.
1594200823|5|On UCTV, UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism professor Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore's Dilemma, (see online UCTV digital video file archive to view), focuses on the thematic proposition that a corn monoculture or any other food monoculture is unsustainable because it depends on a degree of pesticide and herbicide and fungicide use that wipes out what I think he termed maritime culture, or the aquatic culture of lakes, streams, rivers, marshes, and a large region of ocean beyond every river delta.    \\"Unsustainable\\" in that context takes on more than a meaning of aesthetically displeasing to a small portion of an educated elite. Unsustainable means monoculture is life-threatening to this species.    It seems trifling in comparison for a couple of reviewers to piddle about vegan distinctions when the book was not titled The Vegan Dilemma, was it? Not one word about the forest, just the trees, when the strategic big picture is that corn mono-culture is not just something for elitists to sniff snoot about.    If you do not know why simply killing all the aquaculture is life threatening, you could read Desperation Medicine by Dr. Richie Shoemaker. Pfisteria and many other diseases result from mono-culture and factory-farming, because herbicides and pesticides cultivate organisms that prey on humans. That is not a matter of kosher, as one reviewer suggests, or elite yuppie esoterics, or of interest only to vegans, as the reviewers who get lost in the trees and fail to see the forest or strategic point. Maybe unviable would be a better term than unsustainable. Mono-culture is unviable for reasons best explained by Dr. Shoemaker and his friends at NIH and CDC.    I am in the region of Polyface farm. As far as feeding an elite who can afford to make such distinctions as organic, truly free range as opposed to a warehouse with an unused exercise yard, and grass fed, I do not see anybody but upper middle class buying raw milk and grass fed beef. Eggs, even truefree range eggs, are cheap, though!    I also know a lot of inner city underclass people, and they will take all of the organic food they can get. Unfortunately the Whole Foods store is not in their part of town, and they cannot afford to shop there. They understand the issue as one of life-threatening and health-threatening as well as real food tasting different and essentially having healing properties, since the corporatist alternative causes illness.
B0011TNVLY|5|Excellent Christmas classic movie. Already a Christmas standard at our house...The narrative is excellent, a strong heartwarming story line....
B0015AARJI|5|as advertised. arrived promptly
B00571F26Y|5|Among the many books I have read recently regarding this new scary evidence on wheat and Fats.<br />I have been doing a version of this diet for a month and feel, much better, I am not hungry and I even sleep<br />Soundly. I will now make sure I follow Dr Davis's plan to the letter.
B006OAB3ME|5|Got this CD some time ago. It has many old standards on it and MaCartney does them great justice. I play with an ukulele group and these songs are arranged so we can us them in our presentations. A fresh apprroch to wonderful songs.
B00004TH7Z|2|O.k., let's face it.  Iron Maiden's last great album<BR>was Powerslave.  Since then, it has been a steady<BR>decline.  This album is o.k. at best.  Bruces recent solo<BR>stuff is way better.  There are about 3 average songs<BR>on this.  I guess that's better than nothing, but still sad.<BR>Maybe if they got rid of that tool of a third guitarist,<BR>they could get back to business.<BR>Time to hang it up.
B0063IH60K|5|Love playing this app.  Very fun and easy to use.  Highly recommend.  I'd be willing to buy this app to escape the pop-up ads.
B0032CVAQQ|5|Great writer. It's great to know I'm on the right track of loving my husband . Ok already picked my next book by Chapman
B00BP4VWRU|4|Bittersweet, Really enjoyed it. Definitely not as treacly as the title sounds.
B00006FDCD|5|I love scary movies! There are only 2 movies that scare the carp out of me is It and Candyman. My hubby has never seen it so had to buy it.
B004Y1USV2|5|Another awesome album by yes!
B00JCW0BCY|5|Such an insightful man who has insight into the changes needed in modern medicine
B00LP9E79U|1|Bad movie ... just plain DUMB
B005KCGIUY|5|Quick shipping.  CD was shipped in protective package.  Thank you Puscifer store!    This is by far the best Puscifer CD.  \\"Horizons\\" is so personal with me as I feel the same about my father who was taken early by cancer.  His cremation was my first type of ceremony and any song about that experience will always relate on a personal level.    Well developed album with balance and structure.    Thanks for the CD.
B00009YXAD|5|To discover this album was a truly amazing experience. I like the sound of this album, every instrument has it's place and every song has must space left to be filled in by your imagination. Also I like Neil using the complete register of his voice (not so much of the high tones, like \\"After the goldrush\\"). The lyrics.....everything is just right and you never seem to catch the full mystery of this album. All reasons to listen to it again and again.
B000001FAW|5|When it comes to the Bee Gees' music from the 70's, it doesn't get much better than \\"Children of the World\\". At the beginning of 1976, the Bee Gees were facing a potentially disastrous problem. Due to record company difficulties, the assistance of Arif Mardin (the Bee Gees' producer for the brilliant \\"Main Course\\" album) would no longer be available. Arif told the Bee Gees, who were nearly in a state of panic, that they could do it on their own. The result was phenomenal. Right off the bat, the Bee Gees released the irresistibly funky \\"You Should Be Dancing\\", which skyrocketed to # 1 during the summer of 1976. Another top 3 hit, \\"Love So Right\\", followed (A BEAUTIFUL falsetto lead by Barry) and the top 15 hit, \\"Boogie Child\\" after that. Even the non-hits off of the album are fantastic, too. \\"Children of the World\\" is one of the few albums where almost every song is memorable. My favorite is the Blue Weaver co-written ballad \\"The Way It Was\\". The production and the piano work are remarkable, along with the incredible non-falsetto Barry lead and signature Bee Gees harmonies. Other outstanding tracks include \\"You Stepped Into My Life\\", \\"Lovers\\", \\"Love Me\\", \\"Subway\\" and \\"Children of the World\\". This is the perfect album for any new Bee Gees fan or for anyone just interested in hearing some of the finest music made in the 70's. \\"Children of the World\\" is perhaps one of the finest Bee Gees albums in terms of the outstanding vocal performances, production work, and songwriting ability, and it will easily remain a favorite amongst Bee Gees fans, young and old alike.
B0044WSF5M|4|Very good
B00GINENG0|5|I absolutely positively love my talking Tom you need to get this game this game is really fun for toddlers my sister loves this game!!!!!!rate it trust me you will love it download it now!!!!!
B0088P2A7A|5|Changed my life
B0097EWK3A|5|First game I've ever played like this. Had fun
B000ATQYT2|5|great
B00G3HSF7O|3|Given the fact that Matt Damon was cast in the lead role - I expected far more action and intrigue.  Plot felt over-used and weak.
B00024I2Z4|4|I loved Mulan. The little Asian family jokes were hilarious! Frying dumplings over an open fire with chopsticks. Ingenious. The little details of humor are what made this movie so much fun to watch. I'm glad the main story line wasn't about love. A nice relief of traditional animated movies (Pocohantas, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc...), though I've always loved Disney movies. Q: the dog's name is little brother, is that just a translation from the chinese word for little brother? <br />
B00MIA0KGY|5|Love love it!  I play it everyday! The first cut with Michael Blube' wonderful!
B0089LOG02|3|Nice light read, but very predictable.
B000QY9WOU|5|Her usual great self.  This video includes a collage of her very old stuff and clips from her TV show.  Both the new stuff and old were great.  I would highly recommend this video.
B007URVZJ6|5|Very clear and easy to follow instructions
B0051ANPZQ|5|Amazing book that teaches kids humanity and compassion for others.
B00A8MGLAI|5|My wife and I saw this in the theater with trepidation that it wouldn't measure up to the &#34;buzz&#34; it was getting.  But when the credits finally finished and the lights came up - we pulled our jaws off the floor and staggered out with tears of joy running down our cheeks.  Aside from the trickery of having a dozen lead actors each play five or more parts - this film strikes deep into the reason for our existence; how everyone truly is connected across time and reality.  A science fiction action movie with a soul, who knew?  10/10
B007SYWFRM|5|This game is AWESOME! I am hooked on it. The graphics,  the features and the game itself have me addicted.
B004WPT3ZM|2|This is a phenominal package for Megadeth fans and newcommers alike. Excellent liner notes and the amount of material you get for the price is great. But in terms of the remastering quality, it isn't worth it in my opinion. The fact that it is the original mix is great because now you can hear the way the album was intended to be, but if you have the original CD pressing from 1986, stick with that copy. It seems these days record labels are only interested in making remasters and releases louder, instead of putting care and quality into them. Like I always say, heavy metal is great when played loud, but that's why we have volume knobs. If the CD is already too loud, then it clips and distorts in places where it shouldn't be and just sounds compressed and wimpy. Whereas the original sounds great at any volume, especially if you crank it up.
B00003CXTG|5|There is much drama leading up to Dec 7th.<br />At this point in the review process it would be pointless to tell you about this movie. So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.<br />However, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture. An absolutely great picture that is a must see.<br />If you haven't seen this picture, then you should. This is a movie to own!
B00ECU34ZM|2|My family was split regarding this movie.  Some thought the movie was too slow and there were too many questions at the end.  You might have to read the book before seeing the movie.  The other side of family thought that the acting was excellent.  They felt that it was thought provoking and promoted a great deal of discussion.  I recommend that you proceed with an open-mind.
B007SGLZP8|5|This is a great, meandering story with a surprise ending. Would recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I love foxy Bonnie and all of them<br /><br />If you like Fnaf well buy the game Fnaf2 and I love foxy
B00HXYKYIE|5|I learned a lot about elephants
B00B2JSRAS|1|More of the same 'you are your own god' bulls*** that got us in the trouble we're in. A continuation of having all the fun and none of the responsibility for your beliefs, thoughts, and actions.

0553278398|5|Isaac Asimov's Foundation series has managed to take on many of the complex social issues of his (and our) time: racism, sexism, politics, technology, and religion, to name a few.  This latest addition is no exception.  Finally, we learn the full story of Hari Seldon, who appeared only as a figure of mythological proportions in the original novels.<br />Seldon, an assisstant professor of mathematics, has devised a system (known as &quot;psychohistory,&quot; a major player in later novels) in which the probability of certain future events can be calculated with a decent degree of accuracy.  Soon, he runs afoul of nearly everyone in his time on Trantor -- from politicians who merely see psychohistory as a way to further their own ends, to a group of caste-conscious miners, to an extremely conservative, patriarchal cult that seems to have a tie with the mythical planet of Earth.  In between is a hunt for the truth about humanity's origins, and a search for the last remaining robot. Be prepared for a surprise ending!
B0045EJY90|5|This unit has been a great addition to my system.
B006588YUE|5|I've been using this product by Intel with [[ASIN:B00603QXPM Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor 3.2 Ghz 12 MB Cache LGA 2011 - BX80619I73930K]]  processors and so far had no problems with them, even where there's no air conditioner installed the temperature stays at 40-45 degrees celsius. Silent operation and well built.
B002VPE1AM|3|AVATAR is a visual feast. And at an estimated $280 million to make, it had better be. James Cameron, best known for spending as much money as he can on a project (see [[ASIN:B00000JLWW Titanic]] and his other flicks that have given him the nickname \\"The $200 million dollar man\\"), leads the way again as writer/director. And with him comes Aussie actor Sam Worthington who also starred in Cameron's [[ASIN:B001FB55I0 Terminator Salvation]] film.<br /><br />As stated at the beginning, this is a highly stylized, visual film that has 3-D effects galore. You feel like you're riding on the back of some faraway creature as it dives through clouds, brushes the forest tops, and skims floating cliff faces. It is THIS that gives most, if not all, of the film's entertainment punch. If you didn't see it in 3-D, then you're missing out on the best part of the movie.<br /><br />But where the film falls down is its story. This film is basically a rip-off of two ideas: [[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves]] and Frank Herbert's lesser known Pandora series of books ([[ASIN:0425018644 Destination: Void]], [[ASIN:B000RK9FRW The Jesus Incident]], [[ASIN:0441475213 Lazarus Effect]], and [[ASIN:0517031892 Ascension Factor]]). In fact, Wes Studi, who starred in Dances With Wolves as a tough Pawnee Indian, holds a similar role here in Avatar as the roughshod Eytukan. Granted, this is a space epic, but the transfer of ideas from Dances With Wolves still holds very true: A white man comes into native country, battles with them, learns to respect them, switches allegiances, helps save the natives from complete annihilation. This is pure Dances With Wolves.<br /><br />As far as Frank Herbert's Pandora series goes, there's quite a few similarities. The first big one is the planet. In both Frank's and Cameron's universes, the planet is called Pandora. Nothing to get in a fuss about since the mythology of Pandora is well known since the time of the early Greeks. But where the similarities merge is with the planet itself. In both universes, the planet is alive. Literally. And this living force has a name. On Frank Herbert's Pandora, it is a life force known as Avata (hmmm, that sounds familiar too). On Cameron's Pandora, it is known as Eywa. Both planets are hostile to humans but are valuable in their own way (for Frank Herbert is was the expansion of humanity, and for James Cameron a rich mineral source).<br /><br />So for those out there that are touting how \\"original\\" this is, I think you just haven't remembered (or weren't around) when actor/director Kevin Costner filmed his western epic and/or haven't read Frank Herbert's Pandora series (starting with Destination: Void and going through The Ascension Factor).<br /><br />All this being said, Avatar is entertaining. It has that big-screen appeal and escapism that so many movie-goers pine for. And it has some of the best visual effects you'll ever see. But just don't tell me it's \\"original.\\"n both universes, the planet is alive. Literally. And this living force has a name.

B00LP1MVSW|5|I loaded this game because of the Rex picture.  Have not stopped playing.  It is so realistic. I have not experienced any problems with playing the game.  It runs perfectly.  It is great fun.
B00RA10R6E|5|I am 61 years old (going on 41) and absolutely love this album. probably Madonna's BEST since Immaculate Conception.

B00DJFIMW6|1|Daughter has a nextbook as does my son.. same model. .. he can get the download on his but since factory resetting hers she can't.. don't know what that's about but company for nextbook really needs to address this issue. . as far as Amazon apps love then
B004YOEFG8|4|The IMAX Hubble 3D is a video that I will watch several times. Picture quality is excellent, 3D affect is excellent, and the content is excellent, a history of this most amazing telescope with some of its spectacular observations thrown in. It also contains a brief primer about the universe.<br />I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because nothing is perfect but if you are in awe of the place in space we occupy, I think you will find this video stunning and wish it were longer with more of the telescopes \\"pictures\\" and their possible meaning.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|I can't say that this is going to go down as a classic but I can say that you WILL think little differently after reading this book. this is the story of three women but only two of them are of importance; one of them is harboring a dangerous secret and the other is bent on revenge.<br /><br />I thought it was great!
B001NFNFIK|5|It was great seeing this book come to life as a movie..Aside from the stars, LeVon Helm<br />Is in it and also James Gammon, two great character actors who have since passed away.The only<br />Person missing is Cletus<br />and if you are a<br />true fan of James Lee Burke you know exactly who<br />I mean.A James Lee Burke adaptation without<br />Clete is like a day without moonshine.It's<br />still a not to be missed film.
B00I4IWFQC|5|pleasure to have business. Thanks and Happy New Year !
B0020BUWX2|2|It's not a bad read... It's not riveting either<br />The subject matter is interesting in that we will all leave this physical world at some point
B0034G4P8A|5|There are so many reviews on here, i'll keep this short and give a quick girly opinion on the story and Characters...         Just watched this with my boyfriend and I am stunned at how good this movie was!  The action is top notch, the special effects are incredible, the man who plays Thor is ripped to shreds (his muscles of course :D ), which is always a bonus if your a chick like me (or a man who swings that way ;) ), and the story is so deep it held my interest the entire time (and that's saying a lot!)!         I honestly have NO complaints about this movie, I didn't even want to get up to use the washroom while watching it, the story and characters sucked me in and never spit me out!           If you love a great story, a good amount of action, and enjoy watching buff men fly and kick some serious ass, get this movie, you can thank me later! :)        :)
B000B7BRMM|5|One of the best Christmas albums going
B000PMLFRA|5|Any thing less would be a travesty
B00BAXFCPO|5|Great read that provides a lot of Important information. Following the dietary and supplement recommendations has helped me to feel much better on a daily basis.
B000000OU4|5|When this album came out I bought it, thinking it would be good, but not as good as still life (talking), Letter From Home, etc. Well, just when you think there is no way he can keep turning out the great albums, he gives us  another one. This one is different from his others, but great in its own  way. A must-have.
B003TSEEDY|5|I chose a five star rating because I like the story and how parts of it are funny and relatable to real life in high school. I'm not in high school anymore but I can relate.
0780619951|1|The film is so bad that it's not even worth commenting on
B007SYWFRM|5|I'm addicted to this game. Really! Its so fun! Only when I first got it I couldn't figure out how to get back to my home on my kindle fire, still not entirely sure... but I do know that if I click 'shop' I can click the arrow and bam! I'm back to my home menu.<br /><br />strongly recommend this to anyone!!
B00B7VPKMY|5|The cd is GREAT! However, it arrived with a badly beaten up case.
B004XUMMFE|5|We had not seen this delightful series for quite some time and were happy to see it on Amazon Prime Video. The characters are memorable, the story lines original, and the plots provide a nice mix of drama, comedy, and humanity.
0553565915|5|&quot;wow&quot; that is what you will say when you read this book. im not much for books, but my friend and her mom have been telling me about this book for a while, and it is so beautiful and inspiring, just them describing it. so after a while, (since i dont like reading that much), i picked up the book and borrowed it from her and i have been reading it. i like how betty J. Eadie is open-minded, unlike alot of christians. she is not afraid to tell it how it is. i can not tell you how inspiring this book is. and im not even done reading it. this is like the best book. im all for inspiration, and this is so beautiful and touching. it makes me realise that the few caring people in the world, actually want and care for what the spirits want in heaven. they think the same way.<br />other inspiring books, and not boring books: Michael Jackson- Dancing the dream- that and this book is the most inspiring books ive ever read. actually when i was reading Embraced by the light, i was thinking that alot of what Betty was talking about, was like what Michael cares about and talks about. hes such an angel. i wonder if he realises how much he is describing heaven and what the spirits want,- love, and truth,and all that. his book is very complex and i have learned so much through that book.so many precious things, and it opened up my eyes.
B00PTAEXTK|5|Good Movie but really felt for the young student drummer they way the teacher litterally screamed in his face.<br />I can see why as he could see he had the talent but he had to push more out of him.<br />It could have gone either way, make him or break him.
B00NEQRNVG|5|Mmmm....Crossfire!! Great amazing!! Keeps getting better and better!
B00BSBT8M6|5|I hate to admit it but I have never read ` Life of Pi\\", I have come close many times to reading it but have never quite got around to finish it. In my opinion the book is quite unfilmable because there are many elements that exist in the book cannot be truly captured for the big screen, but after watching the film adaptation, I have to admit that Ang Lee has done a very good job.<br />There is a shipwreck and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br />Spiritual questions about faith, meaning of life are the backbone of this film which has been created with the help of CGi. However the CGI is beautiful and drop dead gorgeous. The movie on the whole is very beautiful to watch- possibly the best looking movie in many years- the whale in the night, the scenes in Pondicherry, the Island crawling with meerkats, the squadrons of flying fish, the ocean and the supremely regal Richard Parker. This is a film that celebrates the lush beauty of visual cinema through state of the art CGI: Drop dead gorgeous. Claudio Miranda the cinematographer deserves an applause.
B00VRYCGLO|5|This game was recommended &amp; now I can't put it down! Keep it coming I'm in Mahjong heaven!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great game!! The only thing that I have a problem with is that it takes up so much energy for each search.
0385504225|1|This book is simply...how can I say it nicely...awful! It is way too long and needs an editor urgently to cut about 150 pages of the pontificating prose out of it. The ending lands with a resounding, underwhelming and large THUD...skip this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|1|This game loaded the first two times I played it but after that there is nothing but music and a spider web on the screen.  I need a refund.
B0094BB4TW|1|When was the last time this app was updated...no way to check and it's in need of serious over haul...won't play videos and freezes
1594202842|5|Loved this book. You have to read it and make your own opinion, the bad reviews are from angry parents who perhaps fall into the \\"western parent\\" category she describes here and therefore take it very personal, Chua points out all that she sees wrong in Western society's parenting versus HER OWN.  Not everybody is willing to talk about their children and their rebellions as well as she does, but also praised their successes.  There is nothing wrong with raising your kids to go to an Ivy league school and if there's a formula to do so is just the way she describes it like she did with her children.  We must remember these are her memoirs, we all see things differently and if you are to read this book do it with an open mind to other people and cultures.
B00CFA222M|5|I wonder if Jack of the Beanstalk would recognize himself in this one?  Fun, daring, imaginative for the young people, yet a welcomed updates for those of my generation (just guess; I have been around a while).  Smile
B009IJJ5B4|5|Well done...they make a very good team J.L.M & L.L  have to limit myself to one episode a night...highly recommend!
B00ADQPB50|5|This season is a must! So much going on! I would recommend this to anyone that like something twisted and exciting.
B00688628M|5|Good movie
B00GH738GS|1|The movie is just propaganda for the current administration.  Poor acting.  Don't waste your time or money on this one!
0060734191|5|I first read Sabriel in high school, and upon going to college, I decided to finish off the series and bought the box set. I am impressed with Nix's detailed worlds and ability to create an image in the minds of his readers. This is by far one of my favorite Fantasy Trilogies
B0058P7KUA|5|Tons of fun. Great little shooter. Could use a few extra weapons, but otherwise greatness. One of the few apps I would recommend.
B00DPM7TIG|5|I wish I had more time in the day to just sit and read this book.  This is one of the best reads I have experienced in a very long time!  This is one of those books that when you do have to put down grudgingly due to having to take care of everyday needs, your mind is on the book/story and not on the task at hand.  I will be contemplating this story for a very long time.
B00JB3O6H0|5|Loved this movie!  Not your ordinary storyline.  Ralph Fiennes was excellent.  The movie was very entertaining.  If you want something that's not your run-of-the-mill flick, this is it.
B009ZQC7MY|4|Overall this show still manages to keep one hooked till the next episode. The only thing I would question was the season finale, but it was necessary indeed a truly scandalous season I highly recommend it.
B001BZRUR4|3|Prob a good school assigned read for a young adult. I did not love it. A bit of an effort to finish it.
B008AIGWVA|5|Its  LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO MUCH FUN. GET THIS GAME PEOPLE!!!!!!! This is so I mean SO much<br />Fun. And check out the other games that he mad. There AWESOME.
6305949980|5|My little girl is a Halloween nut, and she's watched this movie probably 20 times already.  I'm very happy with the movie and the seller.
B004WGGQPQ|5|I'm a first grade teacher and my class loves this app.  I also have a 4 year old son and 2 year old son, and thy also love the app.  It is very user-friendly, and kids get very excited about the different projects that can make while using Drawing Pad.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I'm so happy to be able to connect with Facebook. Because I need help from friends some time .it's about time.
B00H71PBQ8|5|The excellent continues. Can't wait for series 5!
B000EF5NAS|5|Thanks for the fast shipment. I love this movie, but didn't have it on dvd. I'm so glad you had it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Really enjoy this series and thanks to Amazon prime was able to watch the entire series and even my husband watches it!
1400062756|5|Helps the mind solve problems in a practical and positive manner. It is not pie in the sky, or silly &#34;think positively&#34; suggestions.
0307588378|3|Loved the book when I first started it, flew through the chapters of crazy twists and turns, at one point not sure which character to side with but then............the end of the book was HORRIBLE.  I seriously kept flipping through the acknowledgements looking for the end of the story.  I hear this is being made into a movie?  I hope the author will take all of the comments into consideration and end the movie with a real ending!
B00AGE20ZI|5|This is a film that doesn't require too much from its viewer but the acting and ideas of it carry you through. I feel the same good feelings after watching this film as I do after finishing Its a Wonderful Life.
B006GWO5NE|5|It is fine.
B00G2GMRCU|5|Here was a chance for the 2 masters to work together and they did in their usual way.  Truly unique how Mr. Baldacci brought them together.
B000000W3G|5|1979 is possibly the greatest song ever.  Plus many other great songs makes this album a necessity to all those who love Rock music.  Smashing Pumpkins is one of the best artists of our decade.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I love it I love it I love it this is the best game in history
B00DJFIMW6|4|This is a fun game but it is VERY similar to temple run... but again it is super duper fun. You should play it
B008MG1E4A|4|Easy and interesting read. Appears very accurate. He tells it like he sees it, pulling no punches. I like that in the end, he exposes the media and politicians for who they really are. We would benefit from more people like Navy Seals.
B00IIU9U00|5|good movie
B00466HN86|5|The as yet unburned into DVD, is a Wow ! ~ of a must see, movie.  Once out, it will go like hotcakes! I've put my name on a waiting list, to be one of the first to know amazon.com is able to ship ~ at least three copies to me. ~ (Scratch that, four copies to me)possibly more,they will be awesome Christmas gifts ~ even as post Christmas gifts if not out in time!     Dad's will be \\"dancing in public\\", just you wait and see! I'd venture to say, things are going to change 'round the house once families see this one.  I dare anyone to prove me wrong.    You like action flicks? You got action.  You like cops in the mix and bad guys running for the hills? You got it!  You like emotion ~ happy; sad; mad; glad; on the edge of your seat; wide eyed and crazed ! You got it.    Would a Grandmother, steer you wrong ~ Nope. I throughly enjoyed, so did Papa and I gotta tell you, he is a hard sell ~ rarely goes to a theater, and he's been telling everyone he sees about it. Not your cup-o-tea you think? Think again.  Don't care how macho you think you are, you'd never hold a candle to these guys. Go ahead, show us how tough you are ~ prove me wrong. . . .
B00BP4Z8XY|5|I even enjoy watching this movie. Super cute!
0547564651|5|It seems that many people who have reviewed this book poorly were hoping from the title to gain some specific parental guidance that they could utilize in their own homes.  This book isn't exactly that, so I hate to see people review it poorly for not delivering on their expectations, rather than taking the book for what it is.  You aren't going to find specific parenting advice here; you will find overviews of scientific studies as well as accounts of some places the conclusions of those studies have best been put into practice.<br /><br />This book does come to a good conclusion about general things we as a society, and as individuals, can do to help children reach their full potential; give them a minimally stressful environment where they are not afraid of failure, where they do fail but learn from those failures.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who enjoyed the book to also check out Paul Tough's contributions to This American Life.
B009HUB40Y|2|Overall I did not care for this game. The play time is too short, and the ads to purchase more items, lives, etc. were obnoxiously constant. Most of these so called &#34;free&#34; games seem to be directed to those who impulsively spend money, like to gamble, or are kids who use the apps without parental supervision.  I like Bejeweled - what you see is what you get. I have obtained several &#34;free&#34; games for my Kindle, and have deleted almost all of them due to the constant &#34;buy more lives etc.&#34; hawking from Amazon. But, as P.T. Barnum has said &#34;There is a sucker born every minute.&#34; Sorry, marketeers, you will have to fish in another pond.  On the positive side, the graphics are bright and clear and (surprisingly) casino like.  Very slick marketing technique.
B009ZXT4BY|5|It is so awesome it was so cool I could not get off of  it my buff would not let me on my kindle
B000ZMCVRI|5|Great music from a legend.
B004IYWN7C|5|We love this movie! Classic!
B00ISJT5IS|5|Outstanding story. Great music. Humor interspersed with action, with the unrealistic parts made believable by Ben Stiller. Inspiring, warm, entertaining.
B005CRQ4GU|5|Because it was fun read. I really enjoyed it my favorite was when he.got chicken pocket by<br />Lindsey's nager thanks
B00VRYCGLO|3|Keeps me entertained. When you get one star makes you want to keep trying for at least two. The power ups will make you go broke, I don't buy them just keep trying.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|fun game to play. flappy wings is an addictive game and similar to flappy bird. my friend and i reccomend flappy wings
B00D7Z4GQY|5|This book is amazing! Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. I was not expecting the secret to be that juicy :0 overall 5 star book!
B008JGSM6G|5|Awsome
B006XBSAP2|5|After watching the Katy Perry movie in theaters I decided to buy her album. I had songs from her album but not all of them. She has an amazing voice and I hope I don't have to wait to long for a new album to be released. Definitely buy this album for pop songs, party song, or if you  just like music. Awesome album!
B001GMQE7E|5|I first heard this on Pandora and was compelled to get up from my comfy chair by the window.  I had been reading as the snow fell 3 inches per hour and was quite settled, but the beautiful music compelled me to seek the source.  I had to squint to read the title on the ipod, and it was a name with which I was not familiar.  I am now.  It is on my radio station list, and I plan to buy more  I began to walk on the path of minimalist music (not that that totally describes Einaudi) while in college listening to Pink Floyd's music.  My tastes, while in the same forest, have learned to love other trees.
B0027MJU00|4|Interesting characters, good plot twists.
0394810112|5|If I could rate this book with a gazillion stars I would nab the FIRST chance I had to do so !  I recommend this ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL book to readers all across the known universe!  (Aliens, did you hear that?)
B00005QW5X|5|I found that I liked everything about this film; the plot/story line, the acting, the musical score, the whole package. <br /> <br />The story of a young East German boy, reared by an unbalanced mother, seduced by a handsome African American soldier, and the victim of a botched sex change operation, is compelling and certainly confronts the issue of how we deal with adversity and reach some sense of inner peace with all those that have transgressed against us and with those whom we have transgressed upon.  The sly manner in which Platonic philosophy is weaved into the story was great. Plato's theories of gender differentiation is integrated into a rock song with cartoons!  Hedwig was dealt a bad hand, over and over, from his/her abandonment in a Midwest trailer park by her African American Sugar Daddy to the theft of her music by a young rocker for whom she once baby-sat. Yet it is reconciliation with the movement of life's ups and downs that is the real point of the story. Hedwig has been abandoned so many times that his/her radar is out for any disloyalty in her band - an obsession that eventually drives them away for a while. Yet, once Hedwig is told by Tommy Gnosis, the young rock star, that he acknowledges (sings) her major contribution to his success, she is able to allow her lead guitarist to move into the spotlight of a transgender rock star. <br /> <br />The acting in this film is super but John Cameron Mitchell is totally over the top. His acting is superb by any measure. His comedic timing is fantastic - delivering wonderful lines with just the right amount of sarcasm and nihilism. Tommy asks: Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior? to which Hedwig calmly states: No but I love his work.  Mitchell's musical performances were as high powered as the dramatic acting. A rock musical is not the easiest idiom to control and master, yet Mitchell excelled. <br /> <br />Stephen Trask's musical score was exceptional. Like an opera, the score must fluctuate between the grand and the intimate, which is exactly what the score from this DVD offers. <br /> <br />I was impressed by the whole dramatic musical package presented here. It is highly entertaining and strongly recommended.
B005MLOKXA|5|I am hooked on this show. I really enjoy the story line and for me, it's the right mixture of drama, comedy, sex, family...I just love it.
0062290797|5|What a great read, his story is fantastic and shows what all of our military personnel may go through. Get it
B00HOWQZYW|5|Wonderful, fast delivery
B004GJDQT8|4|Generally  great  prices.  Delivery as expected.
B00LLMFAAG|5|I love the songs in this album, and I loved Guardians when I saw it in theaters.  I have been forcing my friends to listen when I play the songs and sing along, so we have been having fun with this album.
B00DVKOYBM|5|vury fun love to play it controls are confusing at first but youll geet the hang of it real quick<br />(/&deg;-&deg;)/  worth partying about :D
B00DR0PDNE|5|I have a Chromecast on every TV in my house (7 in all). It is such a low priced and versatile device that only gets better. This week Google updated the firmware to allow you to control your Chromecast with your TV remote by using old HDMI-CEC technology. This just adds convenience over using your phone, tablet, or computer to exclusively control it.

B0042TV4IW|5|love this show well done
B00A8ECU24|1|A little kid app shouldn't have the option to buy items for real money. This is just a disaster waiting to happen for an unsuspecting parent who doesn't pay attention and has one-click purchases activated. I lucked out and uninstalled this before my daughter made any extra purchases through the app.
B001ANSS5K|4|Darn this fella is smart. I find his books enriching. This book reminded me a lot of Looking for Alaska. That is my fave Green book. That said, this book had tons of literary references and plenty of things that make you stop and think. I  like thinking. Thanks and do buy this book!
034580404X|3|Disappointed when I went to read the second book 50 pages were printed upside down and one third of the page was missing. Disappointing to spend good money and receive something not complete.
B0065CCM76|5|Kindle book.
B000NQRE0K|5|Very happy. One of my favorite movies of all times- fast shipping and great quality, as promised - thank you!
B00119ZMKW|5|I have always enjoyed the stargate series. I am glad I can watch them all without any commercials to interupt.
B0070DOHQS|5|I've used all the major RDP apps; Splashtop, TeamViewer, PocketCloud, LogMeIn.  I use Splashtop most, because it's the fastest with live video streams.  TeamViewer probably is more powerful, but a bit harder to configure for video streaming. I like to use apps like this to access my security camera laptop, and view it on my tablet while at home or away.  So I was excited to give Jump a try.<br /><br />Jump is very easy to setup.  Just download the app, then go to their website and download the companion software onto the computer you want to control.  You can do a direct VPN or use your Google account for fast and easy setup.  I was up and running in under 5 min.<br /><br />The connection from my tablet to my laptop is very fast. Probably the fastest of all the RDP apps I've tried.  My security cams were all rendering seamlessly and the video was crisp, clear, and stutter free.  Oh, and I'm running a dozen security cams at once, so it's no small task to stream all that live video so cleanly.<br /><br />I still think TeamViewer is a more powerful RDP app, with file sharing, meetings and all it has to offer.  But the video streaming with Jump is so fast,  that it may well become my day to day, go-to RDP app. Really liking it thus far, and the setup couldn't be easier.  Love it. EXCELLENT FAOTD!! Happy! ;oD<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've been playing around with Jump like a kid in a candy store.  This app is fantastic.  There's a Free Remote Desktop companion program available at Jump's website.  With that, I'm now able to control 2 computers directly with it; laptop to laptop.  I have to say, the more I use it, the more impressed I am with Jump.<br /><br />Dedicated Windows Key - If you've used any of the RDP apps, you know how tricky it can be sometimes just to hit that darn Windows key on the computer you're trying to access.  Jump has a dedicated Windows key on the interface window itself, which makes it very easy.<br /><br />File Transfers - Still trying to figure that one out.  There's always a bit of a learning curve.  But at least I know it's possible.<br /><br />Local Network Direct Connection - the instructions say you can connect 2 computers on the same local network, via IP address, rather than using a Google account. This will come in handy for linking and controlling all my computers at home, without racking up any data fees.<br /><br />Love this app!<br />Go ahead JUMP on in!one out.

B00IJJUIMY|4|Always a reliable outlet when what you want and/or need is a mystery unencumbered with deep symbolism, sociological commentary and a cast of thousands.  Connelly introduces &#34;Lucky Lucy&#34; Soto, an educated, decorated rookie detective, as Bosch's partner with Bosch staring down an unwanted retirement, potentially sooner rather than later.  Between them they piece together colliding cold cases with methods that illustrate what ground level detective work is like when the stars align.  I expect to see a Soto series if Connelly determines that Bosch is truly out of LAPD.  Connelly still doesn't know what to do with Bosch's daughter, who appears as an almost forgotten footnote here.
B003AIEOCY|2|I had read a review where they had concerns over the re-mix quality, I must agree they have done a very poor job from a sound quality standpoint. I have listened to the LP a few times and doesn't matter where the volume is set, it hurts my ears. This is a great LP by the Stones, just be sure and find an original recording, not the remastered.
0765325950|5|Took me 2 years to read through all these, and some of the books were complete trash, but I thought the last 4 books, particularly Memory of Light, made it worth all the bs. What a great ending!
B00DMCV7K0|5|I enjoyed this historical fiction book. It covers slavery and the sometimes brutal punishments given to the slaves. A novel of hope, friendship, trials, sacrifice and strength. After reading this book, it has stirred a desire in me to do something more with my life.  To fight for a cause dear to my heart. Thank you Sue Monk Kidd for writing this novel. I couldn't put this book down until it was finished. I highly recommend this book.
0062206281|3|If you are reading these reviews and haven't read the book, I suggest you to read no more. Almost all reviews here have spoilers. People don't know how to write about a book without either telling the whole story, going over what they liked or disliked or giving away the end. They just don't realize that people read these reviews without reading the book.<br /><br />I liked \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" a lot. I think that Barcelona deserved that book. At that time, I thought it was a book that stood by its own, that it was not part of any trilogy. Then we had \\"The Angel's Game\\", which I found a masterpiece. After reading that book I remember when I told myself that Carlos Ruiz Zafon is one one of the best writers of our time. There was some association with \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", but I still could not imagine that it was part of a trilogy.<br /><br />Only with the arrival of \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" is that I realized that I was immersed in a trilogy, something that I avoid the best I can.<br /><br />\\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" could not be as different from Zafon's two previous novels. Instead of the elaborated and embellished prose, we have short sentences in a fast-paced page-turner manipulative thriller remindful of American bestsellers from Dan Brown or Khaled Hosseini. At the beginning it was a kind of letdown, but at the end I was willing to give him the benefit of doubt.<br /><br />I prefer to believe that nothing was deliberate or accidental. Zafon is all about style. I wonder if his master plan is to write a literary symphony that when put in a context could represent the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Is this his motivation?<br /><br />By itself, \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" doesn't mean anything. The previous two books need to be read prior to this one (and probably need to be reread after). 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 stars don't make this book justice. Since we have to give stars to the book, I give 3. A little bit above the average.
B009P5S11G|5|I love this CD.  I purchased it without having heard it before simply because I heard it was amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This CD met and exceeded my expectations.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Love that this is a single player game and I can play it anywhere syncd with my phone snd tablet.
B00004Y6NP|3|like music !
B00846WWVM|5|I enjoy this game. It is mindless fun and easy to learn. It works great on my Samsung 7&#34; tablet.
B00BIVN82M|5|Great CD. I love Michael Buble's voice, and this CD did not disappoint.
B0055PGUYU|5|Great book! Didn't want to put it down. How the brain works is so interesting and this book does a great job of giving examples and explanations. It really makes you think about your daily habits and how you have formed them over time. I highly recommended it.
B009HQ9UHC|5|I just love it,how you have to think what you need to use, and the instructions are clear. Thank you Rovio best game ever!!
B005OLF6BI|5|This is a great addition to the musical DVD collection I have. Taylor Swift is such an incredible entertainer and really puts forth her animation and desire to include her audience in each song she sings.  I enjoyed watching Taylor bring her best to every performance depicted in this tour.  Definitely worth the money as you will enjoy watching it over and over again. Very pleased with this purchase.
B001CB4SRW|5|Fits perfectly, light weight and sleek. Thanks so much for the great product!!  Will buy again in the future.!!!  Thanks
034580404X|5|All positive things to say about the trilogy I received, and the best way to buy it to read instead of at a regular store
B000QI2ZWW|1|This was a terrible movie.  Inappropriate and portrayed adults as incompetent.
B00C5XBAOA|5|We bought this to go with my daughter's Sofia castle. She loves it. I do wish King Roland, Queen Miranda, andend James spoke. They just make horn sounds and Miranda doesn't do anything, but my daughter loves it anyway.
B00QW8TYWO|5|My daughter and I love it. All of the unique additional characters make it a great game for all ages.
B00IIUATDM|2|The unrelenting use of profanity in the dialogue really turned me off, and I eventually gave up trying to watch this. If Wall Streeters are really this crude, greedy and unscrupulous, then this movie is a great warning for those who play the stock market---my only reason for giving it a second star.
B004SC7B6M|3|This feels more like a soundtrack than an album but it has good songs though they are all similar in sound. not much variation.
B00DETP4FK|5|This is a difficult album to explain. In concept, it shouldn't work. It is mostly ballads that are musically underscored.  What makes it work, however, is K T Tunstall's voice, her strong songwriting ability and the nuances that she expresses through this music.  The more you listen to it, the more it grows on you.
B00EJU8ZIG|5|Lorde has produced a top notch first album, with great music and great style.  Her voice has an unusual and pleasing quality for me. I dont often find myself attracted to female singers and she is one of the few. She produced this music at age 17, and I cant wait to hear more from her.
141041986X|5|\\"When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth, but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. Today is the day of the reaping.\\"<br /><br />For 16-year-old Katniss (and yes, I really hate this name!) Everdeen, the day of the reaping is a day to dread. Panem, the country that was once North America before natural disasters and war laid waste to it, holds a \\"reaping\\" once a year. It is the Capitol's way of punishing the 12 districts of Panem for the \\"uprising\\". Each year, the 12 districts hold a drawing that will provide one girl Tribute and one boy Tribute to the Hunger Games. The 24 Tributes are taken to an arena and dropped off. Imprisoned together, it is ever child for him- or herself. There can only be one winner of the Hunger Games, and it is a fight to the death.<br /><br />Each child between the ages of 12 and 18 is eligible for the reaping. District 12, The Seam, is the coal-mining district. They have only had one winner of the Hunger Games since it started. On the day of the reaping, all the kids are brought into the town square for a televised drawing. But this year, when Katniss' 12-year-old sister, Prim's name is drawn, there is a volunteer to take her place. Katniss is not going to let her sister go to be slaughtered. She immediately volunteers to go as the girl Tribute instead of Prim. Along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son and the boy Tribute from District 12, Katniss is whisked away to the Capitol.<br /><br />Because Katniss has spent the last few years providing for her family by hunting in the Seam, she feels she would have a better chance at survival than her little sister. Because frankly, being chosen for the reaping is a death sentence. Other districts have kids that are bred to be winners. But even if she can't survive, at least she has the knowledge that her little sister will be saved.<br /><br />In a very Shirley Jackson sort of way, The Hunger Games is a glimpse into a terrifying future. In a world controlled completely by The Capitol, people live in fear of what can be taken from them. Even the games themselves are controlled by the Capitol. Each child can have sponsors that give them certain items to help them in the games. And if there isn't enough \\"action\\" to satisfy the powers that be, then the Capitol steps in and makes things more difficult for the contestants.<br /><br />Collins has created a truly horrific look into the future. As a mother, the thought of such an events as the reaping or the Hunger Games makes me a little sick to my stomach. But as a reader and a lover of good fiction, this book is top-notch! Katniss is about as smart and as tough as a protagonist can be. I just fell in love with her. The Hunger Games starts out with a bang, but the suspense doesn't let up...ever! As a reader, you know there isn't going to be a good ending with this one, but Collins never lets you give up hope. From page one, you are immediately sucked in and just can't let go!! I practically read this in one sitting, it was so intense. I just needed to know what happens. Although there is clearly an ending....there is still more of the story to be told. Again, there is a follow-up book that won't be released till the fall. Damn. What is it with me and and the inevitable series reading?? Regardless of that, this is one intense read, and I highly recommend it!!ay, The Hunger Games is a glimpse into a terrifying future.

B00AAQRNQ8|5|The mouse is sturdy with optional weights for your comfort. It fits my hand nicely; Im left-handed so I prefer the right-handed mouse, so that I could use the keyboard with my left hand. And the downloaded appication through there website makes it easy to change your settings like colors and mouse speed, etc.
B0056FMNYA|5|I did review for this product for last 1 Month and finally i went to B&H and finally got it. Trust me...you will love it if u have one. I can tell that u can close ur eyes and trust this product. It has 2 secure lock where ur camera will be steady all the time, u can even jump with ur camera attach on this grip. Bottom line is just buy this product. Keep Clicking
B00DR0PDNE|5|Excellent!
B00JZ4XBRG|5|I'm a HUGE fan and always will be. They could sing children's lullaby's and I'd still buy it.<br /><br />Blood for Blood........LOVE IT!<br /><br />I would say it's a tad harder than the last album and there isn't a bad song on it. I've listened to it thru probably 10 plus times in the last week and it's bada$$!<br /><br />It fits in with the other HELLYEAH albums nicely and it's just plain loud and crunchy and perfect for blasting this summer.<br /><br />Must buy!!!!
B000026LE3|5|No comment.
1597801585|1|Such a great book, but each of the three copies I ordered are misprinted and missing over 20 pages. We didn't discover this until now, and it's too late to return them. So frustrating!
0761174192|5|Beautiful photos and witty captions.
B000B5OD4I|5|Amazingly fast shipping from Japan.  Placed order and receive the watch (shipped from Japan) in 4 business days with tracking #.  Brand new watch with tags and Seiko case.  This is the real deal!  My first fully automatic watch and I absolutely loved it!  Calender tab is in Eng and French.  Will definitely purchase from World Order Inc.again.  Thank you very very much!!!
B009WUAK2M|4|Lots of one liners that make fun of each other's past movies. Lots of good action, and good special effects.
0062287338|5|My wife is currently reading this book and thinks it is great.
B005IZLPME|3|This is a very good movie. Interesting plot. Good acting. Excellent cinematography. My biggest complaint is: I bought this movie for the 3D effect. That, unfortunately, was a major letdown. The movie appears to be a 2D converted to 3D (as opposed to being originally recorded in 3D). If you have seen any of the IMAX 3D movies and use it as a standard, then this movie comes up way short of standard.<br /><br />Don't waste your money paying extra for the 3D feature. If you like this movie, just get the regular Blu-ray version.
B005LAIIMG|5|Different approach to the walking dead. Good acting and stunning action
1451673442|5|A handful of books come into your life and change it.  This is one of mine.  Easy, profound, and of course I am SO, SO, SO grateful to Rhonda Byrne for writing it.<br /><br />Money well spent.  And then some.
B000BYY0RY|5|Kylie shed the cool (almost distant) image she took on during her Body Language period just in time for her long awaited Greatest Hits tour; aptly named \\"Showgirl.\\"  Almost every major hit from the past 20 years show up in either full song or medley form.  The tracklist is as follows: <br /> <br />'Better The Devil You Know' <br />'In Your Eyes' <br />'Giving You Up' <br />'On A Night Like This' <br />'Shocked/What Do I Have To Do/Spinning Around' <br />'In Denial' <br />'Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi' <br />'Confide In Me' <br />'Red Blooded Woman / Where The Wild Roses Grow' <br />'Slow' <br />'Please Stay' <br />'Over The Rainbow' <br />'Come Into My World' <br />'Chocolate' <br />'I Believe In You' <br />'Dreams' <br />'Hand On Your Heart' <br />'The Locomotion'  <br />'I Should Be So Lucky' <br />'Your Disco Needs You' <br />'Put Yourself In My Place' <br />'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' <br />'Especially For You' <br />'Love at First Sight' <br /> <br />And get this, she sings the whole thing LIVE.  No prerecorded vocals here!  A certain Queen of pop could learn a thing or two from Kylie when it comes to singing live. <br /> <br />The highlight of the evening has to be the updated Follies version of Hand On Your Heart.  It's just perfection!  The way Kylie and her dancers move is so prissy and girly, it's great!  Another highlight has to be Put Yourself In My Place.  The backing track for the original song has been mixed with the Star Wars and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind theme songs, adding to the illusion that Kylie is some alien queen seducing mankind with her music. <br /> <br />So, if you want an extravaganza of song, dance (yes, she dances now.  And rather well, too!), and amazing theatrics, this is the DVD for you. <br /> <br />Well done Kylie! A+ <br /> <br />P.S. Kylie is currently undergoing chemotherepy after finding out she has breast cancer last year.  This ulimately led to the postponement of the tour.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Perfect representation of life as it was.  A classic for all time.  Thank goodness times have changed for the better.
B0064MPXFA|5|Very interesting drama! Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00RL9UZGW|5|Nice use of the Equalizer T.V. series with lots of gratuitous but oddly appropriate violence. I had to suspend imagination towards the end but really didn't mind as the story comes out the way you would want it too no matter how improbable. Denzel Washington's character is as unflinching and determined as he was in Man on Fire.
B004J4WKUQ|5|This is probably the first book I have read in years that wasn't education related. The story kept me wanting more, i would often stay up later than I should have just to find out what happens next.
0061148512|5|Sylvia contradicts her morbid stereotype with this remarkable piece. She writes in a very vivid style. Reading this book you will see that her suicide was completely irrevelant to the recognition she deserves

B00005JL96|5|Last night I watched this film and really think it's one of the best Disney features for a long time on the grounds of depth, originality and animation. <br />The plot is very strong and they [Disney], at last, tackle some very sensitive issues without ambiguity. <br />I was surprised by the completely different approach to family aspect in the film and was considerably engaged by many moments in the film. For the first time in cinema, I felt like I wanted to applaud at the end. <br />Still shocked by how much this film means to me. <br />Themes play on your mind - like a very good play by Brecht or Orton, you walk out entertained but also educated.<br />This DVD is one of two versions - Disney plan to release a Special Edition two months later. Maybe we should hold on and wait for it.
B004132HZS|5|In a word:  Brilliant.
B004U7JYXS|5|What you see if what you get!
B00BMKDTNC|5|For some, this final entry into the Wheel of Time may seem a little long winded. It certainly is a long book, with one chapter near 200 pages long. That said; it is the Last Battle! It shouldn't be concise. This is the final book in a massive series, who would want an abrupt ending for characters that some readers have been enjoying for nearly a quarter century.<br />Sanderson does an excellent job of completing Jordan's life's work, finally bringing closure to many a grateful reader. I laughed out loud a few times, nearly cried while reading at the gym, and was literally stunned at least three times while listening to the audio book.
B00AYB0TOW|5|Loved this movie. They did great job recreating this. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a different take on the original.
B009VSW15Y|3|I am happy to have it, but it doesn't take clear pictures.  But then again, I didn't buy my Kindle as a camera
B00BXKKNFS|2|I love Adblock Plus on my laptop, but I can't get it to work with my Kindle Fire HDX.  It gives me a message saying I need to configure my network ports.  Sorry, I don't do network ports!
B00IFORVEQ|5|if you've been a fan of the tv show you will NOT be disappointed!<br />makes you fall in love with the show all over again!<br />its worth the buy/rent!<br />if you're not a fan, you're missing out!
B009X00E18|5|A perfect case.  It protects my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and yet maintains the integrity of the Fire's compact size.
B00JLJ0Y2U|5|I loved the + album, and when I heard Ed was releasing an edgier sequel titled × I was nervous. According to Taylor Swift, this album would have more hip hop and Rick Rubin stated that he would let Ed make his songs and then he (Rubin) would insert more beats and rhythm in the background. This all horrified me. Eds album was perfect. Why ruin it?!<br /><br />Wow was I worried for nothing. The album is like + put much more mature and defined. Ed's talent has truly multiplied. Every song is wonderful, you cannot skip one. Thinking Out Loud, Photograph, The Man, Take It Back,  and I See Fire are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wow. I cannot stop listening. Real music is back. Thank you, Ed.
0920236251|2|I didn't realize what Annikins meant. It is listed in the description - but that meant nothing to me.  It's a tiny, little book - I think the story is complete but the book was too small for my purpose - which was to use in a classroom.
B00BGIBVRG|4|Paul Rudd is absolutely genius in this movie. I laughed pretty much through the whole thing and Melissa is stellar as well. If you have kids or anywhere between 30-70 you'll enjoy this flick.
1400052181|5|So much research has gone into this book, and the writing style made science read like a novel. The book brings up more questions than answers, but definitely food for thought.
076115678X|5|If you, like me, have grown tired of over-processing your hair, and you have any amount of curl, this is the definitive book for you!  I have totally re-invented my look and am loving my newly-embraced curls.  You all know that the hair dryers and the curling irons are not your friends and this book will help you get your hair back to a healthy and natural state...
B009C7JS14|4|Very nice app preforms as advertised.
B008476HBM|5|Some books, and this is one, are indifferent to your opinion. They have stood time's test (200 years), have enduring themes (love and money) and believable characters. Your opinion of them says more about you than about the book. So yes, I love it for theme and characterisation and writing that makes Hemingway sound wordy.
B000ID37KO|5|This is by far my favorite of Alfred Hitchcock's movies. Apart from knowing of Psycho, this movie I got introduced to when I was a child and it still remains a classic for me to this day. I recommend this movie to anyone everywhere I go. Despite the special effects for the times, this movie brought out terror because these are birds, normal ordinary birds that we wouldn't think can cause harm to people. To further find out later on this was based on actual reports of this wild occurrence makes it all the more terrifying.<br /><br />If you're interested in a classic, get this movie. If you're a Hitchcock fan and have not seen this or own it, I say watch it and buy it. It's a worthy addition to anyone's movie collection.
B00P5968FC|3|It was not what I was expecting. At times very creepy, at times just weird.
B00T4GYI54|4|This game is a lot of fun. Easy to play, but with enough strategy to keep me entertained. I didn't give 5 stars because there is a lot of waiting involved with getting items and completing upgrades.
6303566448|4|At first I was a little unwarey of this film, but to see it is to be thrilled. It is very original and has similar black comedy moments to 'Evil Dead 2'. 'Re-Animator' definately deserves a cult status and I can't wait  to see the sequel...
B001UTW7QU|5|I missed many of the 1st season episodes when Fringe first aired. So watching them via Amazon is really great.  All of the episodes in this season had great action, great plots, and endings that satisfied my desire to see justice done. I thoroughly enjoyed each one.
B00005JM1Y|4|This movie was funny from the start, however it could also be put as really stupid humer almost as low as Austin Powers. but it had a bit moore sence to it but it was on the line of the old time hit comedy Get-Smart!!
B008BU75IQ|5|The author tells the story so well and you feel like you are checking up on friends and family. Enjoy the characters and the story line.
B00003CXXP|5|I'll keep this as simple as possible (I'm usually long winded/keyboard happy and forget you don't want a book to read while deciding whether to buy this movie or not):<br />In short, I rented A.I. and, naturally, watched it.  Cried at several intervals (usually don't -everyone says that, I know).  Ended on a very thought-provoking twist.  I immediately started the movie over to watch once again.  Watched it the next night.  Returned it; promptly bought it.  All the while never imagined it would generate such split reviews from 'the people'.<br />I've been to many review sites:  IMDb.com, the Guardian reviews, the user comments from Amazon; and so on.  One thing I've noticed is that people either passionately loved this movies or passionately hated it -with very little in between.  I think the master design of the director was to cause an affect, knowing full well that it would strike a chord with all; positive, as well as, negative.  I think to some its just not within them to relate to the circumstance Kubrick and Spielberg conjurred -so they say they hated it.  At the same time, those who can stretch their imagination and feelings to envelope a robotic child programmed with the ability to love; these are the ones that will just LOVE this film.<br />Direction was superb toward very talented -gifted- actors:  Haley J. Osment(esp.), Jude Law, and even Frances O'connor made me BELIEVE.  John Williams touching score still makes me misty-eyed.<BR>Thank you for your time.<BR>Skot
0385504225|3|Before I wrote this review, I looked at the spread of the star ratings over 1200+ reviews written.  Pretty evenly divided amongst all 5 possible ratings.  And that sums up the book.      I gave it a 3 star rating because it's neither terribly good nor terribly bad.  To me, the story didn't move along quick enough and didn't make me want to keep reading.  There was also one 'jump the shark' moment that upset me so much, I put the book down and didn't pick it up again for three days.   Lastly, I think Brown rushed this to print.  It seems to me that he had 75% of the plot ready and then made the last 25% up on the fly.  (Sorry didn't work for me).    But if you enjoyed Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, you will enjoy this book.
B0014H32MG|4|This short, gem of a book is a fun grown-up alternative to The Hunger Games. Collins obviously took many clues from this book about a man who comes from nothing in a dystopian future and sacrifices his future to compete in a fight to the death on TV that will bring his family riches.<br /><br />The competition and strategies employed by Richard are inventive and brutal, and King offers some engaging ideas about money and our society and what we give up to be passive members of said society. The end of the second act trudges on a little slowly, but the 100 short chapters that count down to the end of the book offer a fun way to feel the impending climax.
0812992792|3|The author flaunts his &#34;writing style&#34; in our faces.  He relates a cruel story about a despotic nation with relish and flair.  We had to read this story for our book club and not one woman liked the book, though all understood its value.<br />Your life doesn't need this look at cruelty, even though its redemptive in the end.  The pain isn't worth it.
B007TK77QE|5|An excellent story line. Well written with good use of English language. Hope J k continues to write more adult books.
0061122416|5|This was a book that makes you really think. I liked it because it was straight to the point. It made me not want to put it down. Its a life lesson in a few pages in a book. A must read if your lookig for something short
159668139X|5|I love this book. I pull it out all the time for help and just to read. When asked by new weavers about what books to buy. This is on the top of the list.
B00T3DNKIE|5|The original publisher must have been prophetic when he shot down this story and had Harper Lee try again. This story needed &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; to come first, it makes this story that much more engaging and Jean Louise Finch's dilemma much more powerful and real to the reader.  I do believe that those who rate this story so poorly are the same bunch of illiterate, uneducated ninnies that are today trying to hide the old Confederate flag because they can only see one of the many ideals it stood for.<br /><br />I hope Sissy Spacek reads the audio version of this book as she did with &#34;Mockingbird.
0385340559|2|Child is reverting to his NBC roots with Jack Reacher.  The two latest books have Reacher less and less an action hero and more and more a left-leaning TV star.  The clincher here is Reacher and troupe donating the bulk of the booty they take to PETA.  This is totally out of character with the Reacher his fans know and love from the first nine books.  If you've read the first nine and loved the character and what he stood for you'll be disappointed with ten and eleven.  I think I'll pass on number twelve altogether.
B00005JLIU|5|Had this movie on VHS and was very happy to find the DVD.  It is a fun movie to watch.  Julie Andrews does a spectacular mob in the role of Millie.
B000A2H812|5|This album is a plethora of punk sunshine excellence that generously and mightily spreads delicious sound with the beauty of immigrant party spice.
B00P596I8Y|4|Very good scary film with an interesting twist as the parent becomes more involved in the overall story. Not your typical B-rated boogieman tale. Overall I thought the film was very interesting and although slow at points, kept me hooked, waiting for the next scene. The child actor did an incredible job, possibly the next big UK film star...Kudos! I'd recommend if you like &#34;Let Me In&#34;, &#34;Sinister&#34;, and &#34;Insidious&#34;.
0375842209|5|Awesome for all ages. I purchased this for my teenager after seeing the movie. i fell in love with it too!
B00008EY65|5|Yes, this is a great movie, with nearly every scene immaculately acted, shot and colored. Besides offering the original film, the expanded DVD set comes with tons of extra stuff, including a commentary track by the creators Guillermo Del Toro and Mike Mignola, and a second commentary track with actors Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor and Rupert Evans. There’s also a 2.5-hour documentary of the making of the film (from pre-production to premiere), as well as over an hour of other stuff showing the production and publicity of the film. Amazing!! It almost makes you forget the confusing scenes and lack of continuity in some places (like when Hellboy punches Sammuel in the subway, but you don’t know what’s going on, or when Hellboy ends up right under Sammael on the subway despite exiting the speeding car down the track from him). Best casting ever – even Guillermo Del Toro says so!<br /><br />DVD 1 comes with several features, and starts off with an introduction by Guillermo Del Toro:<br /><br />The film itself – full of so many amazing characters (Hellboy, Broom, Liz Sherman, Rasputin, Kroenen, Agent “hair weave” Clay)… and a few not-so-amazing characters (agent John T Myers, Sammael, Tom Manning, Abe Sapien, Sammael, Ilsa)… this is a great, classic film that was meticulously shot, deeply loved by its director and cast and crew, full of amazing shots, fantastic effects, memorably and quotable lines, with each shot lovingly shot and composed. Naturally, it’s a “big” and “majorly over-produced” film, but it was still good enough for me to watch 3.5 time this week! Hellboys scenes, lines, antics, gestures, even his very comic fighting style, are all classic. The Cthulan antics are totally insane, and the movie is infused with so much badass style that you don’t notice when there are strange periods of discontinuity (a missed punch, for example, of Hellboy and Sammael punching through the hurtling subway train at different times, but still ending up at the same end of the tracks), or the flipped “left hand of doom” scenes, and the useless scenes with the reanimated Russian corpse (thrown in, perhaps, so that Guillermo Del Toro could provide a voice part?). The bad guys have great moments, from Rasputin’s scene with Liz, his “death” in the abbey ruins, to Kroenen’s wild bladesmanship (and the fact that we don’t hear a peep from him until the very end – his evil laughter after Hellboy gives him a wicked beating is totally creepy). Great little flourishes like when Hellboy meets the little kid on the rooftop (”I’m on a mission,” he says gravely, looking away). Interesting how Selma Blair looks a lot like Linda Hamilton, who was Ron Perlman’s co-star in the Beauty And The Beast TV series.<br /><br />Two commentary tracks – more on that below.<br /><br />DVD comics – Ragnarok: the Gate of the Dragon, Abe Sapien, the Samaritan, Pamcakes comic, explanation of Hellboy’s belt: the talismans (click on the thumbnail to get an explanation), Hellboy Scrapbook, Rasputin: A Short Bio, Kroenen bio.<br /><br />DVD 2 comes with several features, “grouped” thematically into “Egg Chamber”, “Kroenen’s Lair”, “Maquette Video Gallery” and “Ballamie Hospital”; introduction by Selma Blair (0:30)<br /><br />Egg Chamber has content-related bonus stuff… sorta.<br />Deleted scenes: “Breaking the ice wall”, 0:40, is just that and is nothing special. “Cab Ride”, 1:24, shows charming cab interactions between Myers and Liz that was cut out for being inappropriately flirtatious. “Russian Warehouse”, 2:33, shows Rasputin and Ilsa buying the fist-hole slab that we see at the end – very cool scene showing pots of Nazi gold, corrupt Russian military officials, etc (see also Captain America: Winter Soldier).<br />Documentary: 2:33:00, an exhaustive journey from pre-production and planning, through all aspects of production, ending with then film’s star-studded Hollywood premiere – more on that below too.<br />Filmographies and character bios: Filmographies of 15 actors and production people, with some expanded to include character bios in words and images. Bonus! These include Hellboy (likes: City Lights, Three Stooges, Marx Brothers, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton), Liz Sherman, Professor Broom, Tom Manning, Agent John Myers, Grigor Rasputin, Kroenen. Great illustrations by a famous comic book artist, can’t remember his name…<br /><br />Kroenen’s Lair has geeky stuff about how the film was made; introduction by Guillermo Del Toro (0:30)<br />Scene Progression of Ogdru Jahad<br />Animatics Intro 0:33, Hellboy and Sammael (on West Side Street) 1:57, Hellboy and Sammael (on subway) 1:30, Hellboy and Abe (underwater chamber) 3:00, Behemoth 0:41. You can watch a comparison, or the animatic only. The animatics are chunky graphics, and they often can be somewhat different from the final film.<br />Board-a-matics – Introduction by Guillermo Del Toro (0:44). Scenes include BPRD life (0:13), Bellamie Hospital (2:10), the bridge (1:23), Hellboy rooftop (1:34), supported beam tunnel (0:16). Again, we see comparison versus the full-screen board-a-matic, and in the case of the Bellamie Hospital scene the board-a-mtic was better than the final cut.<br />Storyboard comparisons – Also very similar to the animatics and the board-a-matics, we get Ragnarok (3:47), Machen Library (2:33), Hellboy and Sammael (2:52), The Corpse (0:41). Nothing special here, probably, unless you’re a film student.<br /><br />Maquette Video Gallery – this shows the model statues that they created to be guides for the film-makers, rotating 180 degrees, with front-back-and-sides thumbnail pics of the four head angles. This includes Baby Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Sammael, Ogdru Jahad, The Corpse, and Behemoth.<br /><br />Ballamie Hospital – promotional stuff.<br />Nine segments that include two theatrical trailer and seven TV spots. “Print Campaign” includes “Poster Explorations” of 69 posters, and “Final” posters, including the cool “fight evil with evil” poster, and a few that looked very much like what they did with Raiders Of The Lost Ark.<br /><br />So, the documentary is longer than the film itself. What’s all in it? It starts off with a bald Mignola talking Jack Kirby, and showing the original Hellboy sketch he had done for a convention that then developed in to his first writing and drawing project. Compares the concept to the X-Files. Hellboy’s a regular joe, not mysterious – he likes pizza and beer. Shows lots of sketches. Hellboy is a Mignola character, Kroenen (and Liz, and Myers actually) is a Guillermo Del Toro character. Goofy pre-production work with model of Hellboy, Sammael, Abe Sapien. Brief shots from Comic Con press conference, Broom’s office model, set designs, stunts to be done physically on set. Ron Perlman jumping around in harness, Sammael’s stuntman as well. Director of Photography Guillermo Navarro shown. Day 1 (of 116) of shooting is in Manhattan. Mignola was surprised how much John Hurt looks like Professor Broom. Then… Ron Perlman talks!!! Guillermo calls John Hurt one of the best, classiest actors working today, and how he heightens the father-son relationship between Hellboy and Broom. Hurt says he’s never made this type of film, although Alien is similar. Mike Mignola fawningly notes “The way he’s handled in the movie is the way I would have handled it if I’d given him more screen time.” Mignola has a weird way of talking about the movie, disarmingly sarcastic somehow, cunning and kind. He seems something different than what he appears – interesting, sweet, and tricky. Guillermo Del Toro notes that “Even the most miserably odd creature in life has a purpose”(?!?). Great shot of Hurt, Perlman and Guillermo Del Toro on Day 1. Then, on day 6 – Ron in full make-up. Hanging out with the animatronics guys (each segment seems to explore a differentpart of the film-making process). Day 10 – Belamie Hospital. Selma: Lucky that Liz isn’t a major character in the comic, so that there’s more for her to play around with. Day 12 – Machen Library – action and stunts. Huge challenge. Shows Jimmy Hart, Hellboy’s double. Guillermo Del Toro in a Godzilla suit and Mike Mignola in a suit of armor are extras here. Day 14 – West Side Highway shoot. Perlman, “When I used to be a carny… it was just like this.” Carny?!?! Day 21, Magick exhibition, stunts. Day 24 covers casting Ron as Hellboy. Hurt always thought that Hellboy looked like Ron Perlman. Espressive despite prosthetics. Four hours to put on make-p. Watch most of the process. “From old Jew to superhero!!” Day 35 – Abbey Ruins, with Rasputin and Nazi regalia. Day 38 showing Nazi scientist shot that needed to be “fixed” with CG… and we have another Raiders Of The Lost Ark moment. Day 58 – Broom’s office, an incredible set (Blair says in the commentary that she cried when they took it down). Tried to follow colors of the comic in the set design, and Mike Mignola’s backgrounds informed the set. Day 60 shows Broom’s office again. Building the Abe Sapien costume, the fastest they ever put it on was six hours (says Ron Perlman – the documentary says “four hours”). Day 70 was the BPRD medical bay, and an explanation of how they filmed the “naked” Kroenen, and built his prosthetics. Day 73 – Right Hand of Doom. Day 75 – abandoned shower room, talk of Sammael’s suit and tentacles. After a while you realize that stuff that you thought was CG was real, and stuff that you thought was real was CG. Day 78 – the underwater Abe is digital, the dock was dry so that the camera could move through it. Day 82 – building Hellboy’s look, and his clothing, Liz’s look and Kroenen’s garb. Day 85 – subway with kittens. Day 103 – hexagonal stone slab, mixing puppets and CG. Day 113 – Tunnel “A” bridge, setting up stunts. Day 114 – more bridge. Second Unit, Day 8 of 9 – CG of Hellboy fighting. Two Hellboys. Then we jump to five months after the end of principal photography. Narrator explains the difference between foley and effects. We see how sound is redone, the sound editor talks about making it sound good. Orchestra doing the score. Premiere time with no more talking. The documentary closes with lavish praise of the director, including John Hurt, who says “if you wanted to insult him, you’d say that he’s fat; he needs to be that way to contain his enormous heart.” The enormous praise comes off a bit cheesy, but later on in the commentary it continues to come out strong – maybe it’s not misplaced here at all, then!<br /><br />Commentary: Mike Mignola and Guillermo Del Toro. The opening had originally been more elaborate, but now it’s more epic, with the Lovecraftian quote. Broom’s voice is in the new opening. Gillermo Del Toro meantions Arthur Rackham’s trees. The Eyeless Christ is an homage to Sam Fuller’s “The Big Red One”. Mentions Caspar David Friedrich, who paints church ruins. Mike Mignola sees the swastika monocle of Von Krupp as gone too far, laughs. Discussion of that great scene where the drifting floodlamp floats against the Ogdru Jahad’s awakening eye, it was an image he wanted for a while. They shot the opening set for several weeks in freezing Prague, icicles were everywhere, they lost several steadycams to ice. “In the extended cut you will see this…”, says Guillermo Del Toro, although I have no idea what he means when he says that – this DVD set doesn’t include the “extended cut”!! Dreamer… Guillermo Del Toro praises Rasputin and Ilsa’s love. First thing Hellboy sees in our world is a cat carving. Mike Mignola discusses his experience of being in Prague. Mike Mignola: “This is a real Mignola shot.” Our intro to the adult Hellboy in the movie is via a comic book cover (”they never get the eyes right”). Guillermo Del Toro on Ron Perlman: “He’s the only actor who could have made this movie work.” 37:10. Same Prague hallway as Amadeus in the hospital scene. 45:00 Mike Mignola seems to sometimes be pithy or sarcastic towards Guillermo Del Toro, but always lets the geek have the last word. Guillermo Del Toro can’t resist having foetuses, jarred items, slime, subways and autopsies in his movies. When Rasputin comes out of the shadows in Liz’s room he’s actually in the cheapest but most efficient shot in the film. “The whole movie rests mostly in contrast between the orange and the blue.” Pancakes inside joke when Hellboy gets them delivered, but says “pamcakes”. Flips shot at 59:50, giving Hellboy the “left hand of doom.” Built entire Palmer Street subway station, complete with stinky extras to give it that authentic New York subway smell. Guillermo Del Toro calls this the best casting of any of his movies. Mike Mignola confesses that he was wrong to want to go straight from the rooftop scene to the funeral, thereby skipping Hellboy’s grief scene, very big of him to admit that (his wife wanted to slap him for that, he says). Funny how Guillermo Del Toro likes to say “Freudian” a lot, and how he hates the Rubik’s cube (and Abe, as smart as he is, has never gotten beyond two sides). In cemetery there’s a tombstone that says “Here lies Mike Mignola.” “Oh, that’s funny – I’ll have to buy the DVD,” Mignola says, pithy as always. We find out that Guillermo Del Toro is the voice of the Corpse (maybe that’s why they wanted to include that useless prop). Ilse completes kiss at the end. “Hell holds no surprises for us.” Mignola cracks a pithy joke: “If you don’t hear us, it’s because we’re kissing.”<br /><br />Commentary: Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor, Selma Blair and Rupert Evans. Blair asks Perlman how he became involved, he mentions eating pork with Guillermo Del Toro during Passover. Blair mentions that it’s Passover at that time too! Recurring riff on “overweening”. Ron Perlman talks about Guillermo Del Toro’s amazing commitment to the film, mentioning that “there is no part of his being that he didn’t pour into this film. He ended up as drained as I’ve ever seen a human being, but boy what a great result!” We find out that shooting started at noon or 1:00 AM, depending on the day. Only one scene with blood. Talking about the soundtrack, the four actors can’t remember the name of the musician who recorded the original “Red Right Hand” (Nick Cave!!!!). Never a still shot – although the camera may settle eventually.<br /><br />I could only watch half of the commentary of the actors, they were entertaining but didn’t have as much to add as the other commentary of Guillermo Del Toro and Mike Mignola did. It was a good choice to do separate commentaries for the two “themes” of originals (the creators, versus the actors).part of the film-making process). Day 10 – Belamie Hospital. Selma: Lucky that Liz isn’t a major character in the comic, so that there’s more for her to play around with. Day 12 – Machen Library – action and stunts. Huge challenge.

B00A85EMVK|5|This movie has more stars just breaking into their careers than most know:<br />-Tom Cruise<br />-Val Kilmer<br />-Meg Ryan<br />-Tim Robbins<br />-And more...
B00009YUPY|4|It works very well - better than the wireless competition!  Good value and I love the fact that I don't need to feed it batteries.  Good for the environment.
1101946342|5|Seems like a repeat to me.
B005LAJ22Q|5|I watched Season 1 and Season 2 on Netflix. This review is for both seasons and is posted on both. As a TV series, other than Friday Night Lights, I've never been so drawn into a world.<br /><br />The main characters have distinct personalities.<br /><br />The men:<br /><br />Rick Grimes - The moral leader.<br />Glenn Rhee - Smart, stealthy, supporter of the team. He's accused of being weak at times but is the opposite.<br />Daryl Dixon - Loner. He's rough around the edges but inside has a good heart. They're in the south, so they needed a hard core redneck.<br />Shane Walsh - Bad ass cop, he's the one who you're never quite sure about. Friend, or foe?<br />Dale Horvath - The group's elder. His words of wisdom are often lost on the younger generation. Isn't that how it usually works?<br />Hershel Greene - Opinionated, but somewhat delusional, he thinks they're dealing with a virus for which a cure will soon be found.<br /><br />The women:<br /><br />Andrea - The strongest, yet at times, weakest, of the women. She contemplates suicide more than once but learns to protect herself.<br />Carol Peletier - The weakest of the women, she lets men abuse her, and seems clingy.<br />Lori Grimes - The unofficial \\"First Lady\\" of the group. She's at times mother, at other times confidant to the women, at other times supporter of the men.<br />Maggie Greene - Farm girl who falls for Glenn. She lives in Hershel's dream world until reality jolts her.<br /><br />I've read a number of the 2-star reviews (as I never read the 1-star ones) and most of them focus on how \\"we've seen this all before\\" or the plot is \\"contrived\\" or \\"people just don't act that way.\\" I'll address each of these cons for folks out there who might be interested but have been turned off by the negativity.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />The beginning. A cop named Rick is shot. He's in a hospital. When he wakes up the world has fallen to chaos. It feels too familiar to 28 Days Later. But that's where the similarity ends. Rick comes across a father and son, who save him and tell him it's safe in Atlanta. That they will soon make their way there. So Rick decides if his wife and son are alive that's probably where they'd be. Atlanta, of course, is overrun. He hides in a tank where apparently the operators were also taken by the virus. Rick is saved by Glenn who watched him crawl in the tank. The group who Glenn is with outside the city happens to be the group whom Rick's wife is with; and she isn't alone. She's been getting down with his best friend Shane, who left him to die in the hospital.<br /><br />Contrived? I'd say, yes, there are some coincidences that seem a bit far out, Rick's reunion with his wife the most egregious. It will depend on your point of view. I think when you start watching, you expect him to find his wife. If you think it shouldn't have happened, you'll think it was contrived, no matter what. Because in that situation it really has to be \\"contrived.\\" This reunion is what drives the rest of Season 1, so if you can't suspend disbelief with regard to it, you will hate this series.<br /><br />Why do they kill themselves out of nowhere? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what to say to this. Wouldn't you think about it in their situation? This is very real to human nature, in my opinion, and I didn't think characters \\"did it out of nowhere.\\" They were probably all thinking about it at one time or another, only some were actually willing to do it.<br /><br />Guns? Why didn't they have more guns? After all, why wouldn't that have been their first priority? With all the guns in the South surely their would be guns EVERYWHERE, falling from the sky, the naysayers pout. I say in a time of panic, humans shift to the most basic parts of the pyramid for survival. Food, Water, Clothing, Shelter. Guns would certainly be on the list, and these folks admitted they needed more guns, but I could understand how, in a time of panic, that might not have been as much a priority. Also, in the beginning, they didn't necessarily know their would be \\"herds\\" roaming. They were away from their town and far from the city, so they had a false sense of security.<br /><br />Why do the characters keep doing dumb things? Admittedly, these excursions lead to chaos more often than not, but isn't that why we watch? Don't we watch or read these zombie dramas to see the group attacked? To see how they react to adversity? To watch the breakdown of humanity as we revert to our basic instincts? Rick has a good heart, and he DID grab guns from the station. When he was ambushed he left them in Atlanta. So naturally, his inclination is to retrieve the guns, while doing something good: saving a man he handcuffed to a bar. That is in-line with him as a character: analytical, pragmatic, but not always totally logical. This is in contrast to Shane, who at all the twists and turns believes they should be ruthless. The contrast is clear throughout, never so much as the end of Season 2.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />The bottom line: if you enjoy the zombie genre, great acting, interesting characters, wacky situations, and heart-thumping tension, (and if you have Netflix or AMC on demand), I'd highly recommend throwing on the pilot. This is the type of series where the hook is obvious and if you aren't into it by then, you won't be. If you are like me, you're in for a very, very fun ride, and you won't be able to stop watching once you've started.<br /><br />-Raeden Zeny.

B0053KWDES|5|My daily driver headphones, AudioTechnica ATH-M50, still benefited from this amp (although not high impedance) in terms of clarity.  Where you can see this amp shine is with lower sensitivity headphones, like my Superlux HD681.  It makes a huge difference in clarity with the high gain switch.
B00003CXPJ|1|In a word, innane.  In two words, sophomoric and stupid.  Don't bother.  Between over the top portrayals and no perceivable plot, this is a waste by any standard.
B0001AVZA8|2|That's what the writers, directors, producers, etc. of this movie must think.   They expect us to actually believe that a leering old coot like Nicholson would hold some sort of appeal to the character who plays Diane Keaton's daughter.  I know lots of younger women would have gone out with him, but only those who are interested in his money (&amp; presumably, that's not the reason for Keaton's daughter's attraction to him).  Even the attraction of Keanu Reeves's character to Keaton's is unreal.  Spare me the diatribe about her being accomplished, intelligent, blah, blah, blah.  It just ain't happenin' in real life.<br />It was cliché (in a \\"PC\\" sort of way), predictable, and preposterous.  While it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it was definitely a waste of time.
B00AIQP9DE|4|Pretty good graphics, especially for a mobile app game
B00KWVZ750|5|The game  I  truly EPIC ! I love the different piggy's and the rage chilies. I suggest you should get this app for you or your child(children).#EPIC
B00FGEO9NE|5|Great acting, plot, intensity, really a well scripted and executed series.
B00BUCW54Q|5|I don't usually comment on movies.  In fact, this must be my first.  I must say though.  This was a simply perfect movie.  You had to actually think about it.  :D  I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to anyone!
0967175429|5|I had previously purchased Vianna's book \\"Go Up & Seek God\\".  I had difficulty with the technique because visualization doesn't come easy for me - I am more of a \\"feeler\\".  Plus, the word \\"God\\" was a barrier for me.  However, I loved the possibilities of the technique enough to purchase this book.  In this book, she seems to have expanded her concept of the source of creation and healing which is very appealing to me.  I also appreciated her emphasis on self-help.  She doesn't seem to have any of that 'guru' mentality.  To me, the most important feature of her growth and expanded vision is her use of muscle testing to discover weird beliefs that are stuck in your energy field!  That alone was worth the price of the book.  I even bought a copy for a friend.  There are many other ideas she explores in a very 'non-creepy' way such as mysterious implants, spirits, indigo children, etc.  This book and the book \\"The Parallel Universe of Self\\" will change how you view life and its possibilities.
B000MCIBE8|5|Great album
B0095R64AO|1|Slow, boring.  Waste of $1.99.  Glad I did no opt for Hd for one dollar more. Pick another movie to watch.
B0002234LS|5|I read the book before i saw the movie &amp; when i saw it i was with my friend, who hadn't read it. &amp; i was sitting there thinking... this would be really confusing if i hadn't read the book. There was a whole major part that happened when Mort Rainey was in college that was left out &amp; it explained a WHOLE lot.<br />If you haven't seen the movie or read the book... then go read the book first. It's a novella in the huge book Four Past Midnight by Stephen King. If you've seen the movie but not read the book then i don't know if it's too late to read it. You will probably have a hard time imagining anybody other than Johnny Depp as Mort Rainey. That was the book that got me hooked on Stephen King though.<br />There was one part in the movie that was better than in the book though... &amp; that was the ending. In the book some random guy comes &amp; saves the day but in the movie it's way better (i won't spoil it for y'all). It is a GREAT ending in the movie!!!<br />Overall it was great but read the book first if you haven't seen the movie (Four Past Midnight by Stephen King)!
031606792X|5|This is the fourth book in the Stephenie Meyer Twilight series.  I've loved every one of these books.  In this book, she continued to surprise and delight me with events happening that I hadn't thought of.  She is a great story teller.  With so much publicity, I don't think I need to say much about the plot.  I think it's best when the reader can be surprised.  I will say it has a happy and wonderful ending.  It is a long book, 754 pages, but I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />I think anyone who likes romance novels should read this series.  Briefly it is about teenagers: Bella is a human, Edward is a vampire, Jacob is a shape-shifting human/wolf.  Although the vampires prefer human blood, they refrain from it and drink from wild animals in the woods.  Therefore, the vampires are able to live among humans without killing them.<br /><br />The books in order are: Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn I gave every one of them 5 stars.  The fifth book Midnight Sun has not been published but the preliminary draft is available on the author's website.  Twilight is told from Bella's point of view. Midnight Sun is a retelling of the first book from Edward's point of view.<br /><br />Sexual language: none.  Number of sex scenes: some happen but they are referred to rather than being shown, to keep within the young adult genre.  Setting: current day Forks, Washington.  Copyright: 2008.  Genre: young adult paranormal romance, vampire, werewolf.
B004VMVTNU|4|The app has lots of features and flexibility, but it's not too hard to figure out (although definitely not as simple as some other alarm apps, either).
B00F8L2VO4|5|I love Duolingo. I have installed the app on my I-Pod Touch and on my Kindle Fire, and also use the website. Each one gives a slightly different approach, though they all sync together.  I am using it to learn Italian. I have previously tried language tapes and even took a class at a local school.  My progress is much greater with Duolingo.  It is also fun to use and the I-Pod Touch app includes pronunciation practice.  I have recommended Duolingo to several other people.<br /><br />I should mention that I am an &#34;older&#34; learner, being on the high side of 60.  I know my retention would be greater and I would learn even faster if I were younger, but I also feel that it is a great memory stimulant for any age group.  I am learning Italian for fun primarily, because it is a beautiful language, but I think a trip to Italy will be my reward!<br /><br />While Duolingo is great as it is, I think it could be improved by providing some sort of reference feature or dictionary were users could look words up and maybe get more explanation of the language rules, etc. It is sometimes frustrating when words are introduced without much explanation or my translation is marked &#34;wrong&#34; but I don't know why.  All in all, it is still a great program.
B00EMXBDMA|5|I could not put this book down.  Cover to cover in less than a week.  The book was written on line and vetted by a ton of science.
B008NCSZQ8|5|I absolutely love this movie and have watched it at least 3 times.  I love how Marvel ties in with Thor and Captain America.
0385754728|5|I loved this book and would recommend it wholeheartedly. We did it for book club and it got rave reviews all around.
0440245206|5|Just finished reading this book and loved every page of it.  The family struggle that so many folks go through and the details of working it all out and this is really a delight from start to finish.  I have become a solid fan of Danielle Steel.
B00FAPF5U0|5|A very fun game for all ages. A definite stress reliever that can easily get you hours of non-stop fun.
B00R3DOCJM|2|Personally, I think these Hobbit movies got successively worse with each segment, meaning that the \\"Battle of the Five Armies\\" was the worst of the bunch. Or maybe I just had had enough after the disappointment of the previous two! This is so sad because the LOTR's movies were so very well done and while I will admit that the tone of the LOTR's is a bit darker than \\"The Hobbit\\", this is no way serves as a excuse to make a cartoonishly stupid, clich&eacute; ridden and utterly CGI vomit-filled depiction of this classic story. But this is how they make action movies these days, dumbed down to the lowest common denominator and super hyped-up to sell all the ancillary merchandise that goes along with creating a multi-movie franchise. I actually felt sad for Martin Freeman in this movie because his character (Bilbo) was largely regulated to the background and any scenes with emotion came across as shallow and forced. The only thing I really liked about this movie was the closing song, \\"The Last Goodbye\\". At least it had some genuine emotion and it made me feel something for Tolkien's Middle Earth, which is something these Hobbit movies just didn't succeed in.
B004KKX814|5|My kid was extremely pleased… high quality beyblades and very interchangeable parts.  No complaints whatsoever.  please note this does not come with the launchers or ripcords…
B000XUBFE2|4|The first several pages are hard to get through, and I almost gave up, but am glad I did not.<br /><br />Zusak is a very gifted writer, although his style in this book is quite unconventional. He is quite the master of foreshadow and emotion based descriptives.<br /><br />The story itself is captivating, but extremely sad - heart wrenching in fact. If you are looking for a feel good story, this is not it.<br /><br />Overall, it is certainly worth reading.
B000002ACR|5|This is a beautiful album. I think it's the best album the Byrds ever did.<br />The songwriting here is amazingly consistent: Crosby adds the best song, his wistful, vague Everybody's Been Burned - it's one of my very favorite Byrds tracks. It's also one of Crosby's best compositions, up there with Triad and some of his Crosby, Stills & Nash tracks. There's also a classic cynical attack on the rock industry with a jazzy trumpet part (So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star); a few ethereal folk-rockers with lovely harmonies (Have You Seen Her Face?; Renaissance Fair; Time Between; Thoughts and Words), and my personal favorite of the Byrds' Dylan covers, My Back Pages. I personally think the title of this album was inspired by the \\"Older than/younger now\\" theme that Dylan's song presents. There's even a space-rocker, sort of like the tracks from their last album (Fifth Dimension), and it's tremendous (CTA - 102). I'm not a fan of Mind Gardens - it hasn't held up very well - but other than that this is a triumph. Not as experimental as Fifth Dimension was, but it's far more consistent - though Fifth Dimension was a strong album as well (if you haven't heard the title track; Eight Miles High; Mr. Spaceman and I Come and Stand at Every Door... well, you're missing out).<br />I'll admit I'm a Crosby-era purist when it comes to the Byrds, and I think their later albums are a massive drop-off from this one. However, each of the group's first four albums have something to offer, this in particular. Melodious, well-written and perfectly harmonized. A classic and masterpiece.
B00A6CCF0K|5|I'm not a big writer and never do book reviews and I never read the original shining, I only saw the movie.  I read this on kindle...wow.  You have to have read or seen the movie shining to kind of understand it.

B007SYWFRM|5|I had fun playing this game you guys should try it that animal is crazy about his nuts lmao I can play this game all day
B006PIXKVW|3|good story decent casting for the characters and has its moments I would watch it again but it was fine the first time
B0000DEOAI|5|A new music idiom, bold, complex, layers of meaning and sound. Use for film sound effects and rattle the listeners and viewers.
B002LC2DQ4|5|very good product
B002MW50KO|5|Either you &#34;get&#34; Dylan or you don't.  If you don't &#34;get&#34; Dylan, go waste your time on the new trendy garbage that surrounds us.  If you do, then you'll surely dig this holiday effort that Bob has released.  It is full of traditional songs from the holidays and has a very warm feel to it.  I love the band Dylan has assembled here, Phil Upchurch, Donnie Herron, Patrick Warren, George Receli, Tony Garnier and David Hidalgo, they just plain resonate with greatness and add the perfect touch to these compositions.  Dylan has selected some really cool songs and has some really cool arrangements to the traditional fare.  I'm not into a lot of Christmas music, but this one has earned a place in my CD player for sure.
B004FOOQV6|2|I had trouble converting gal. to lbs. It has a lot of potential otherwise.
B005544TRQ|5|This is a great show with a fantastic plot and character development. The Amazon streaming service was amazing too. I highly recommend watching the show.
1405267674|3|The content was ok for my son that started playing that game.<br />I got problems with the seller, because the pages came in the wrong order.<br />But I removed all the pages and put them in a binder. My kid discover some stuff<br />that he didn't know. Recommended for beginners, but buy it as new.
B0002IRY0O|5|Just as Celi's EMI/Munich box is irreplaceable as the distillation of a lifetime of dedication to this greatest of symphonists, so too is this earlier set 'essential' listening. A comparison between the readings from the two periods is tremendously illuminating of the evolution of Celi's art.  With tempi closer to 'mainstream', in some ways this box will be a more palatable choice for many.  These readings are much to be preferred over vonK (technically adept but self-regarding), Boehm's 4 and 7 (any blind listen will verify how bland these discs are), Barenboim ('instant on' profundity), Chailly, etc.<br /><br />Celibidache, Wand, and Blomstedt remain the triumvirate of modern Bruckner conductors.
B003GK21YE|4|ENJOYED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH
B00002RAOU|3|[good things]<br /><br />Some of the best kills in slasher movie history, some great blood and a nice cold setting. The acting was pretty good for being an Italian movie, and the characters, at least were very well developed and easy to get along with.<br /><br />[the bad]<br /><br />The actual plot was good, but it really didn't interest me. It (to me) seemed like there was too much going on, and it was hard to watch the movie, enjoy the kills and think about the story. The ending was really lame, It was great how it ended, but I did not like the 2 kids... I just thought it was silly.<br /><br />[final thoughts]<br /><br />I remember watching this movie as a kid, and hating it. Rewatching it years later was a treat, and my opinions were almost opposite of the ones I had back then. The atmosphere in the movie is great, it reminds me of the atmosphere in the first Friday The 13th (Sean S.Cunningham got the inspiration of Friday The 13th from this film), which seems right. It is no secret that Friday The 13th was inspired from this movie, but inspiration and perhaps the setting was the only similarities that I saw. There were 3 kills in this movie that mirrored (almost exactly) kills in the Friday The 13th sequels, which was fun to watch. The kills in the movie are very well done, bloody and really nasty at times.<br /><br />I thought (aside from the intricate plot) was very good, and a very solid slasher flick. A must see for the genre.
B00FAPF5U0|3|There is only one problem for me. All the missions should be different. Like the most of my missions so far are just clearing jelly or bringing down ingredients. To me they should ALL be different. Otherwise I like the game.
B00BD99JMW|1|I'm trying to read my book iffy dithered ndnfidfih fifth if chinch find j jnk ugh h j j Jon
B007IXWKUK|5|I love this story a little shallow but that's what women want. Love can come in more different ways but when it comes it beautiful .
B000QRIGLC|5|A colleague told me about this book.  I picked it up on line (kindle).  I couldn't put it down until I was finished.  Great read and makes you proud to be an American
B000JMKRKC|4|This book is beautifully written and mysterious through to the end.  A story about a great storyteller. Not a super heavy read, but it is not straight-forward so requires some thought!  I would definitely recommend this book to friends!
B008JEJPXM|2|I guess they were for men.  Way too big.
B0006JGFNQ|5|super cool, but not for a young kid
B00PJ52FB8|5|Arrived ahead of time. Love all the songs. And, it's a plus that I get to listen to them on my phone also. Thanks!
B00AMBLDEE|4|Pretty good with lots of action. Ending could have been different but I guess it was like this for the sequel. I believe Jason will make an appearance in the next movie.
B006M4F67A|5|I really enjoy playing these games.  On long flights particularly it makes the time go by.  The tiles are really pretty and interesting too
B0042TV4IW|5|My parents would love this series.  Can't wait to share it with them and other family members.  We need more material like this.
B00BD99JMW|4|Let me start with saying I do not read books for themes, I read them for the story, I want to know what happens to these characerters I have fallen in love with.  Well this story was something, I got my ending, though not the one I wanted.  I did enjoy this book, even if I finished it bawling my eyes out at the beauty salon.  It wrapped everything up, I did not really have any questions left and I enjoyed every moment of it (well more now that I am finally done crying).  I enjoyed this series, though I do not think I will ever be brave enough to read it again.
B0054JZC6E|4|I liked the games a lot. they are fun to play. my only complaint is all of the adds. they get old fast.
B00130UFY2|3|This movie is basically a non stop chase scene.  This actually gets very boring.  I was going to watch the whole series but now will not.  In addition, the movie did now feed well, having frequent breaks.  This is not a problem when I get films from netflix, so I don't think the problem is with my equipment.
B00E8KLWB4|4|It's ok entertaining.
B00BFUUMO8|5|Fun missions that alternate being  challenging and easy. Also short explanations about each creature are informative. Three different parks in one game.
0312263120|1|This is a book that gives you two choices: reading it very quickly trying to find some gem in the mud or thowing it away after the first 20 pages. <br />It is a strange mix of wrong computational concepts and idiotic mathematics, which will only buy a 10 year old kid. <br />Anyone with the lightest knowledge will get angry reading the concepts Dan Brown tries to push on the reader... even more considering the introduction that tries to tell us that he did some research. I think that his research material consisted of a bunch of D-rating sci-fi of the 80's and Roadrunner cartoons. <br />So, the only thing left is the thriller story: and old mix of kills, sex, car pursues in an European country (very fashion)... just clichès, clichès and more clichés... boring, boreng, boring. <br />Let me give you a piece of advice: don't waste yout time with this book, buy an other one, spend quality time with your family... whatever you like. <br />
B00HJ92QTI|5|From the first minutes we were drawn into the story and the action never let us breathe for a minute of rest afterwards.  Riveting story and stunning graphics.  The CGI was seamless and perfectly done.  You either bought the premise and enjoyed the ride or you didnt and thought the movie was dumb, (according to the poor reviews I have read).  I enjoyed it and will watch it again.  Bullocks acting was spot on, and I was drawn into her characters internal demons and rebirth.  It really makes me mad to read the negative reviews that concentrate on her looks, age, or her demeanor during the disasters...  get over it.. females are in space and have been for decades.  The fact that the director didnt plop in the current teen fav starlet of the month for the role is to be applauded.  As for her unprofessionalism and lack of training...  you do realize that we sent up a bloody teacher once, you think she could have done better with all her so  called training too?
B004SJ3BCI|5|A Really fun and challenging game for both kids and adults. Makes you look for ways to do more damage with one bird.

B000002H2H|5|In my opinion I think this is the greatest hard rock/thrash/heavy metal band there ever was. What seperates them from the other bands is they have good lyrics and do not growl like the cookie monster. Plus their songs are long and not like most bands who only play a song 2-3 mins. Theirs goes on for like 5-10 mins. They have excellent guitar riffs in MOP and RTL. Although I have to say RTL is my favorite because it has From whom the bell tolls and especially fade to black. But Master of Puppets comes a very close second. if you really like this album I suggest also buying MOP and AJFA.

B001AH6ZWY|5|This is one of my old time favorite movies.  I just watched it again for the first time in many years, and remembered what a beautiful film it is--very thought provoking, good acting, and a wonderful story.  I enjoyed it again so much, I decided I had to own this movie so just ordered it on Amazon.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B00004R7TP|5|I was very glad to find Kate had re-released Hounds of love with extra tracks!! For a start, Under the ivy is one of THE Best Kate songs ever made. Period. Be kind to my mistakes and Burning bridge are 2 brilliant upbeat tracks and Lagan Love is simply gorgeous. The remixes are good enough. If you liked the original album then this is worth re-buying for the new songs, also there are lots of new Kate pics, which is an added bonus!!
B00K0OI42W|5|I really enjoyed reading 'to Kill a Mockingbird'.  It was one of the books I had to read in high school and I did read it then but wasn't impressed.  By reading it now I was able to fully understand all the things that were going on and I really found it interesting.  I loved the way the story was told..
1455521205|5|Among his best efforts.  Have read them all and really enjoyed The Target. Baldacci is good at keeping you turning pages and not putting the book down.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|Interesting popular history by a biblical scholar with limited credentials which reads somewhat like a thesis positing the historical Jesus as a revolutionary. Hesitated to pick this one up because of the criticism the author is not a biblical scholar of repute. However I thoroughly enjoyed the work and found his thesis an interesting one. I think the book has merits on the case he makes alone and that it is best left there. I learned a lot from the book and the author impressed me with his scholarship and understanding of New Testament history. It helps of course that I have no issues with viewing Jesus through a historical lens. What impressed me most about the book is the courage it took to write and publish it in the face of the tsunami of criticism from the evangelical Christian following that was sure to occur after their earthquake of indignation that someone who is not a Christian dared to write about an historical Jesus without taking his divinity for granted or even to account. No matter because Jesus of Nazareth will continue to confound both those who write about him and their critics.
B00BUCW54Q|4|Great movie
B0095ZMMCK|5|Threat Vector includes Jack Ryan in the background making the tough calls and Jack Ryan Jr. out there doing it in the field. Threat Vector has plenty of covert action John Clark style and something to think about as cyber-war comes to the forefront.  With the Chinese applying their well developed strength in system hacking and at the same time, stirring it up with traditional war making in the South China Sea, it leaves one to consider the balance of cyber vs. ground, sea and air forces.  Great read in keeping with Tom Clancy signature style.  This is the second book in his series written with Mark Greaney and I hope there are more to come!
B00N1HONIO|5|Get this if you like horror games and jumpscares while it's at a kids pizza place.

B004OC07F8|3|Very good book for the curious reader but it really lacks the &#34;How to create&#34; part or at least laying down some basic framework for a new strategy.

B00475AYJQ|3|As indicated by the subtitle \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles: Day Two\\", The Wise Man's Fear picks up where The Name of the Wind left off, continuing into the second day of the telling of Kvothe's tale. The Name of the Wind was what I consider a perfect epic fantasy, combining the timeless quality of a fairy tale with the believability of a legend gone to myth. Patrick Rothfuss' writing is dramatic without being overly so, his prose is beautiful, and his language feels archaic while still remaining easily understood. There is no denying he's a natural-born storyteller.   That said. For as long as fans waited, I expected better.  To start with, I had every intention of re-reading The Name of the Wind beforehand, but ended up just jumping into The Wise Man's Fear when the mood struck. I spent the first several chapters regretting that decision. It had been so long since I read the first book that it was hard to rekindle the enthusiasm and I'd forgotten enough to be a little lost. The story's progress has slowed to a snail-like pace. If a third of this book was removed, it would've been better for it. Countless pages are spent on mundane and repetitious threads, while more exciting events are summarized in just a few sentences. When I finally got to the end, I was relieved that I hadn't spent any more time with this tale. (It took me more days to finish this book than anything I've ever read before.)  Rothfuss still proves to be very good at making key elements relatable to his audience. Much of Kvothe's story continues to center on the University. His academic endeavors, as well as his social experiences, resemble real college life. Kvothe is a very talented musician, and his music is another relatable aspect of the novel. If you're an artist, or even if you're just a no-talent aficionado like me, you can relate to the way Kvothe's music is a big part of who he is. As for this reader, I enjoy spending time in a nice, cozy bar, so naturally I enjoyed the Waystone Inn interludes the best.   However, I had difficulty accepting that Kvothe could be only sixteen or seventeen years old during these adventures. Admittedly, I'm a hard sell when it comes to child characters. Some authors have made me believe that a kid can fit an adult's worth of life experience into so few years -- Mark Lawrence's The Prince of Thorns, for example -- but only a very few, and this time, Rothfuss didn't quite pull it off.   It's because Rothfuss set the bar so high with The Name of the Wind that a three-star rating seems bad by comparison. To give credit where it's due, there are some moments of exceptionally gifted writing in The Wise Man's Fear. Nonetheless, when I look back at my reading experience, what I recall most is boredom.
B000UNYJXQ|5|No matter if you like Michael Moore or not, you cannot deny how unbelievable the facts in this film are.
B00GQ7OZR0|3|i loved dexter but I hated the last episode. it really sucked. why kill debra off and he could have just met up with whats her face instead of dumping his kid off with her
B008JGSM6G|5|this is a very fun game. it can be very adicting.the only thing i would change is free hints every now &amp; then.
B007IXWKUK|5|Great book bought it for my fianc&eacute; and Ill jus leave it as I'm pleased with the buying it for her!!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5|The second season is even better than the first.  The characters are developed more and we get to see a softer side of Harvey and Louis.  Thank goodness they brought Donna back.  She and Louis make the show, not to make any less of the others.  Intense, funny and sexy. Not to mention the fashions.  What's not to like?
B00JE5AT6C|5|The best police movie !! Probably, I've seen, this movie, like  5 times. Never gets old. At least for me.
B00AEUPOVQ|5|persuasion is romantic movie about an &#34;old maid&#34; of 27 who gets a second chance at the love of her life.  loved both amanda root as anne and ciaran hinds as captain wentworth.

B009U9S6FI|5|I had to read this book for a class. I was not expecting to like it, but it turns out it is really good. Much of what he says is very interesting, and I personally also believe it to be true. Regardless, I think it is well worth the read and will be interesting for anyone with an interest in people.
B00I8Q77Y0|3|Will ruin your life... it's like the same thing as flappy bird but since that's no longer on the app store this will fulfill your addiction
1449410243|5|The Oatmeal is a fantastic artist and has a great wit about him. This is not some 400-page compendium on feline science. Take it for what it is - a great gift book and a funny coffee table piece. It is absolutely brilliant
B005DKLPQ0|5|Great Remastered Sound  sounds much better than my old CD&#34;s
B00EV1YZ96|5|My daughter watched this for 16 hours straight on the way to florida.  I think she likes it just a little bit :) We as a family love watching this classic move.

B0089LOG02|4|A good read.  Well developed characters.  Realistic portrayal of what probably happened to orphan children in the early twentieth century.
6300267997|1|This is the first review I've ever written in my life but this movie was soooooooooo bad that I had to save people the agony of watching it.  If you value your time and taste then stay away. This movie really offended me; she is sooo full of herself and annoying throughout the whole movie. The whole time I was cringing and wondering why anyone would put her in that role, why didn't they see how bad it was going from the very start but then I got my answer at the end when I found out she was the executive producer. The close ups, the songs and her lines were just not right for her. Kris K. was ok but he was way too cute for her, basically she comes into this mans life takes everything and not once does she thank him or apologize for not understanding him and when he dies she is mad at him for leaving her. This movie made me hate her. And I seriously think the whole movie was about her nails. I'm just so upset I watched this egocentric maniac for that long it was so bad that at the end I had to mute it I couldn't stand her voice anymore and most of the time I had my hand up to block her face so I could try to get into the movie. Anyway, bad bad movie and she's an ugly ugly person and not just physically.
B0045HCJKS|4|Still good after all these years. Not too dated, but you will get a chuckle looking at their computers.
B00HZ4ASEC|4|This movie is very funny, it reminded me of Wild Hoggs.  I love how the industry is making movie just for the seasoned actors.
B0026P3G12|5|Awesome voice!  Hope it is only Susan's first of many!! I will definitely buy any CD she makes!
B006GWO5NE|5|Up to this point it seems to work fine.  I gave the highest rating more for the fact that Amazon supplied the charger at no cost/no prob.  It must be a common occurrence to need these for my style of KINDLE.  I will know in several months if this product truly rate this rating.
B00C8S9VKM|5|I have read at least 10 Brysons, not all would receive a 10, but his writing and humor is some of my favorite when he is ON.... He is on here...  One magical summer a lot of stuff........ Very well researched and Entertaining. Could not put it down......
B00HDMMISA|5|I loved this book.  I actually hate writing these reviews ( I am a reader, not a writer!) but this time I am happy to write one.  I loved the unique way the author let this story unfold.  It kind of starts at the end, then goes back to tell what happened to get you there. I also loved the miscellaneous remarks at the end of the chapters from all the outsiders.  I can't explain it well - you will just have to read it yourself, lol!  It was humerous at times, as well as serious, and I had a hard time putting it down.
B00PEVD59I|5|So far so good. I like the challenge! Very colorful graphics too. Haven't tried without wifi, not sure if you have to have it.
B005CRQ2DK|5|Love this book and the hole series l read them all the time i had to force my mom to buy this book
B00J5LXT44|5|Great show.
1465435506|5|This book was my 11 year old son's favorite birthday present! Great book for a Star Wars Lego Fan!!
B000VNMMQ6|4|DH4 was the only one I'd seen in theaters and I did enjoy it. When they released it on DVD and Blu-Ray, it was largely available only as an unrated cut (or it had both in one set). This disc is just the PG-13 version and it's a pretty solid transfer of it.<br /><br />Be warned, though, the special features aren't censored, so there's quite a bit of strong profanity in some of those.
B00F91RYL8|5|I didn't want to watch this at first thinking that it would be silly, but my husband read the book and was interested.  I was surprised that it was a great film.  Interesting plot, not over the top action, and although there are zombies in it, it's treated in a different way than I expected.  Not really a horror film or an action film, kind of a mixture.
B00FWLDHSY|5|Loved the story, action, and the special effects. The look of the Jaegers were awesome and very realistic looking. The whole movie was awesome, exciting and very entertaining!
B000QRIGLC|4|This was a good book about SEALS.
B006MW3UZW|5|Great acting! Wonderful plot, reminds me of Biltmore! This season will keep you interested and wanting more. Can't wait to watch Season 3!
B00AECGQF2|5|It is so funny!! When you blow dry their hair their faces are so weird!! So anyways I recommend this app for people who love to laugh.
030746363X|5|The book is awesome, it is not only entertaining but also super helpful.  He covers every point on the topic he's talking about the good and the bad, and unlike most self help books he shows you the data and the science behind it and allows you to make the decision on its validity or legitimacy as a practice. I thought it was a great book, super fun to read, and the slow carb diet really works along with cold showers, its awesome, buy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This book was funny, romantic, heartbreaking, and wonderful all at the same time! I loved every page, and every emotion that I went through reading this book.
B00785P2QC|5|the game has lots to do and has a great feeling when you start to expand your city and control your own business
B009BJAPLK|5|Excellent. Sherlock can notice anything. The peculiar behavior of Sherlock is entertaining and so is his witt. The stories are also interesting.

B009LDCXNY|5|the natural chemistry between the actors, and their sense of humor, not to mention theyre gorgeous..love to watch this series
B008XBCJ34|5|I first saw the movie in the theatre in 3D, and when I recently bought a 3D Blu-Ray, I had to get this as my first 3D movie.
0399241515|5|Alexander Tate <br /> <br /> This book named Scorpia written by Anthony Horowitz is the second book in the \\"Alex Rider Adventures\\" was an awesome book! It was full of suspense and was an all time thriller. I would give it two thumbs up. It was very amazing how Alex(the main character) did all of these death defying stunts when he was only 14 years old.  <br /> Alex first went to Venice to look for Scorpia, which at the time he had no clue what it was, in order to find the truth about his father. When he finds the truth about his father he falls into a world of hurt, anger, revenge, and dishonesty. In the end though Alex cleared his mind and went back to the good side called MI6. MI6 was a spy program that saves the world and stops Scorpia. Scorpia was an assassin group that was a major terrorist organization that did people's dirty work for them, but at a very high price in money or gold. Alex also had to become friends and trust the person who was the whole leader of the organization of Scorpia. Her name was Mrs. Rothman, a very rich woman who's sidekick was Nile. He was a black belt in karate and in weapons.       <br /> So if you like a James Bond-like adventure that has suspense and thrills you should really read this book and all of the other books in the Alex Rider Adventure series.
B00004RF8J|5|Excellent! Thank you :)
B000VWYJ86|5|I thought I could not enjoy another Bourne movie.  Yet, my teenage sons and I completely enjoyed the action and intelligence in this movie - all because of Matt Damon.
B005NQ5LQ4|4|To be honest, I only prefered a couple of fight scenes in this flick 'not keen on story telling flicks' but what made me purchase this version 'region 1' was purley due to the sleeve print. It has a true meaning / feeling to the flick.
B00O8NPCA8|4|This movie is so much fun!
B00HHYEOY0|3|May not be his best work yet, but it is nice and I enjoy it. Very ethereal, good music to listen to in the morning!
B00INIXVMK|4|written well,historically informative and some insight as to future developements.
B00JVP0FIC|4|I have had this app for a while now (the free version) and I had no problem with the permissions because I simply gave them an email address I created long ago for exactly this purpose: registering so that I can sync between all my devices. They can dig around my email contacts or whatever as much as they want, there is nothing to find and nobody to spam. I  never sign up using Facebook though. If lots of permissions bother you, I recommend using an &#34;empty&#34; email account.<br /><br />Now for the app itself:<br /><br />It has a google chrome extension, which means the moment I sit at my PC, I only click on one little icon and tada! There are all my notes. I don't keep anything particularly personal in my notes, it's more of an organizational tool for me. I do, however, keep my notes &#34;private&#34;. If someone happens to be able to see them, they're not going to find my social security number in there. All they will see are my tedious chores for the day. I like the colors of the app and I like it that you can customize each board as you like it. So far it has synced without any problems between my computer and my kindle fire hdx. I agree that it seems to be a bit buggy, but seeing as I'm not using it to record anything of vital importance, it really doesn't bother me. I guess what you think about the app depends on what your expectations of it are.
B006ID6NDQ|5|This is a true story of how a young girl of Austrian Jewish descendant survived the holocaust and war.  She describes the fear, sacrifices, segregation that she endured to survive.  She also lost family and friends to the death camps and horror of Hitlers reign.  This was an interesting perspective told by the survivor.  I enjoyed the story very much, although horrified at many of the atrocities that occurred, it gave you real insight into what happened during those times.
B009E3EY4M|5|This was a great buy, and was well worth the wait.  I play it often, and have bought it for other friends.
B00688628M|5|This is one fantastic series.  I cannot -- at all -- recommend it more highly!
0316743003|5|This book led me to Clarence Kelly who Ben  Rich worked for.  I would read Kelly then this book to get a clear chronology on the briliiance of these two guys at the Lockheed Skunk Works created by Kelly and inherited into the  Stealth Fighter by Rich.  Both brilliant people.
B00H58VGIA|4|Assuming diligent research by the author, the plight of slaves was a life in<br />HELL.  Freedom denied is the worst, but the arrogance and cruelty of the<br />self-righteous owners is beyond belief.  Unfortunately, the belief that certain<br />persons are inferior by virtue of their birth continues in this self-aggrandizing<br />USA.
B003TH2LA8|5|This series is well done, right amount of action and intrigue.  Very much enjoyed the entire season (and season 2 as well).  Thank you Amazon!
B003JLA4KS|5|I was at the first show for TRIBECA and was just a few feet from Alex and Geddy who also spoke at the front of the theater....that was a great experience.   The movie was also well made with lots of old footage and great accolades from other rock bands (i.e. Metallica, KISS, etc.).      A must see for any Rush fan!
B0054JZC6E|5|first it is 101 games plus16 I thought it was a great game because you never get board from it ethier. I also loved because the games are so fun
B004XUMMFE|5|I missed this show in 2002.  I did not learn of it until a couple of weeks ago.  Watching the first episode I was hooked.  This show is great.  Best of all, its heroes are people I would actually like and would invite into my home if they were real people.  This is a show where the good guys win.  It is extremely well written and the special effects are great.  I'm so sorry this show was cancelled after the first season - what a tragedy. I only wish they were making shows like this one today.
B00IG7MRN2|1|Sure Don't waste your money on this one.... To much of just a story &amp; not enough game.. So very little games with this one.. Not to mention it came up as app of the day &amp; it took my money any ways... Not very happy at all with this... Usually I love the G5 games but sure wouldn't or couldn't recommend this one!!! Very Disappointed!!!
B007EC27QM|5|A big display, easy to read, easy on the eyes. My favorite calculator to use day in, day out. Keeps last calculation until I delete it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|I found the book easy to get into and a quick read.  I think the ending was weak though.  Still I would recommend this book
B000PHX4VA|5|Great album, would highly recommend to fans
B000003N7K|5|The reason I bought this album is because of the piece 'My One and Only Love'.  Its almost the only track of this CD that I listen to, and I also included it in my laptops MP3 library.  I first heard this song on radio some 30 years back and was on the lookout for the LP.  I am happy it came out on CD.<br />If this was a CD single of My One and Only Love, I would still buy this single at the full CD price!  <br />A classic.
B00EOGZ42U|5|This game is highly addictive. Especially if you like strategy. It is super unique and not like any other tablet game I have played in the past. Once I got past the training stages, I couldn't put it down. Beware, this game is not for everyone, but if is for you then you will find yourself dreaming about it at night.
B00CW6DAKC|1|Id love to give this game a 5 star rating because once it works it'll be a lot of fun BUT besides the loading and refreshing issues, which I could live with, the worst thing is that I constantly get someone else's farm presented. meaning I rarely get to play with my farm, instead I get a farm presented which is clearly not mine. After deinstalling and reinstalling over and over again and contacting the mighty creators of the game it still hasn't been resolved!!!<br />I read of others who experience the same problem and im surprised it hasn't been fixed yet.<br /><br />once this issues are taken care of im more than happy to give it 5 stars, until then its not even worth the one star I had to give in order to post a review.
B00NOPQU2K|5|Unputdownable! Brilliant read!! Loved this book!
B00A3NQNUU|5|so much better than other games like this. this game has races and many other things to do than hatch and level up
B0000039LE|4|I'm not a big horror fan but I did Like Halloween, it was spooky but it wasn't too gory like a lot of the newer slasher movies. I liked everything in Halloween except what happened to the dog. I did enjoy watching this movie and I really like Jamie Lee Curtis. I highly recommend the movie!
B00OKYQZDI|5|so much fun to play
B004FRX0MY|5|Amazon Prime Music is an awesome format
B008220BLG|5|I haven't watched it yet but I'm dying to watch it . It looks so cute and romantic. Hope my review helped
B007SYWFRM|5|kids love it and lots of fun . more entertaining than i expected,  given the topic.  grand kids 3 and 5 think iys great
B00B2166BS|2|Doesn't really seem to charge must faster. I guess I had much higher hopes. Not to mention it's a pain to maintain connection if you use a case, as you will typically have to remove it from the case to ensure connection.
B006JRSMRG|2|Too much drama. And high school is not THAT ridiculous.
0671578855|5|Before I get actually started, has anyone else noticed Bujold's penchant for using the word &#34;saturnine&#34; multiple times in pretty much every book she's written?  It's such an unusual word that it caught my attention and it seems that at least one character per novel gets that word tacked on as a description.  I feel on some level it's a subtle running joke but maybe she just really likes it.  And if you never noticed, now you'll probably be unable NOT to, or you'll go back and count.  She's probably cornered the market on its usage in fiction.  Just as well.<br /><br />It's an interesting word choice because this book is explicitly described as &#34;a comedy of manners and biology&#34; and it seems to be a deliberate attempt to ramp down the intensity level of the last few books into something a bit more light-hearted.  As most of the books fall weighted into one of two camps (i.e. &#34;Space adventure&#34; and &#34;milestones in Miles' life&#34;), it shouldn't be a surprise that this one seems geared toward all the people that look forward to seeing Miles get older and encounter the same hurdles of maturity the rest of us do.<br /><br />This time, it's about love.  In fact, all about love.  Ever hear the Wilco song &#34;I'm Always in Love&#34;, well, we have that here in spades as pretty much every character in the book undergoes a romantic entanglement of one form or another (the only people who escape unscathed seem to be his parents, and they're already in love).  Miles is still trying to figure out a way to confess his love for the fairly recently widowed Ekaterin, who kind of digs him as well but is a bit shy, and dare I point out again, a recent widow (relax, he sucked).  His clone-brother Mark is visiting from Betan colony along with his young love Kareen, recruiting her into a venture that involves bugs who make the tastiest waste of all.  Unfortunately for him, coming from a relatively uninhibited world sexually to a planet that seems to require a gobetween to hold hands throws some snags into how much togetherness they get.  Meanwhile, preparations are being made for Emperor Gregor's wedding, which has roped in Miles' cousin Ivan, generally a lad-about-town.  His mother's work in organizing the wedding and her own budding romance with the former ImpSec commander has kept her from steering every available woman toward him but Ivan has noticed that available women are becoming few and far between.<br /><br />You would think with all this going on there'd be little time for an actual plot but Bujold also manages to shoehorn in two issues with Counts that are up for votes . . . one fellow is about to lose his Countship because an ancestor sowed some wild oats while the other is attempting to break the gender barrier in a bit of a roundabout fashion.  Oh, and someone is accusing Miles of murder.  Got all that?<br /><br />Needless to say, the book carries a five hundred plus page count (about the length of &#34;Mirror Dance&#34; without the fiendish sense of urgency) and for the most part she justifies it.  She's breezy enough to keep all the balls juggling in the air and doesn't let one plot fall out of focus for too long before shifting back to it, but gives it all enough heft so that book never feels padded.  Indeed, you can read this one in hundred page clips without really coming up for air, not easy with a book that lacks a degree of suspense and except for one scene is almost completely action-less.<br /><br />Where she does succeed is characters.  Relying on the fact that we're invested in these people, she writes them with the easy familiarity that makes us believe they've known each other for years.  Some of the most fascinating parts are the conversations that feels deceptively easy, such as Miles talking to his father, or Mark with his mother, or Miles with Ivan, there's just the right mix of love, exasperation, goodwill and teasing that only comes when you've known someone long enough to know how far you can go to joke, or what to say that will finally make them listen.  Miles, as usual, is the driving force behind all of this, both on the political and domestic ends, and there's some amusement in watching him approach romance the same way you plot storming a beach: at dawn, full speed ahead and darn the torpedoes.  As the newcomer, Bujold has the hardest job with Ekaterin, forcing her to walk a tightrope between restrained romantic feelings and a sense of &#34;what am I getting myself into&#34;, someone who isn't worldly and thus charmed by Miles but also isn't willing to let him goodnaturedly steamroll over her.  She more or less pulls it off, finishing the job that was started in &#34;Komarr&#34;, and some of the most honest conversations are between them, as they try to determine what boundaries, if any, to set, testing each other, afraid of taking the plunge but afraid of walking away either.<br /><br />The other attachments work their way in as well, generally centering around Mark and his concerns with his ladyfriend.  The &#34;bug butter&#34; scenario shouldn't seem to work in the context of the book, especially when coupled with the more real-life concerns of paying for school and learning when your parents can stop telling you what to do . . . but it blends in with all the other mishaps easily enough.  Mark remains tricky to write, his social awkwardness has to be played both serious and for laughs, but she never has to forget that he's recovering from a serious mental illness.<br /><br />All of it, honestly, works better than it should, although at this point its probably completely inaccessible to new readers.  In the hands of someone with less sure footing, it would have been a total mess.  But she balances all the concerns nicely, giving us small peaks and victories (and one disastrous dinner), coasting on the edge of farce without truly succumbing and pulling it all back into realistic emotions before it gets too cartoonish.  Even the stuff that should be the comic relief (a gender change, or any scene with Ivan, really) feels grounded in a way that would be difficult for anyone that lacked her longevity.  And amazingly, it all comes together in a bravura Council of Counts meeting that handles all the multiple threads with alarming ease, with a pacing and momentum that keeps the victories coming, the suspense in play and even allows time for a sidebar without evaporating any of the mood.  You get to it and you want to cheer because everyone gets what they deserve, and what's more is that it never feels forced.  Barrayar really is home-field advantage for her.<br /><br />And thus Miles gets launched into a new stage of his life and while Bujold apparently doesn't believe in normal dating, it does feel earned.  One thing Bujold did well with bringing Ekaterin into things is giving us an outsider view of Miles' world and how utterly intimidating it must seem to normal people.  As readers we're too used to the setting to be anything but jaded but seeing Miles just hanging out and chatting with the Emperor from her point of view reminds us of what rarefied circles he travels in, and what it's taken to get him there.  With all the famous people he knows, from his parents on down, it's like finding out that the guy on your softball team grew up with the British royal family.  It gives us a fresh view on something we've probably started to take for granted.<br /><br />Any quibbles I have feel like quibbling.  You may it odd that the book seems to take for granted that marriage is something that pretty much everybody wants (although to be fair, Mark and Kareen never talk marriage, and Ivan's mom has someone else's wedding to plan) and moreso there's no real hint of relationships involving anything but guys with gals.  Granted Barrayar is a bit of a restrained planet culturally but coming from a woman who used to write a hermaphrodite (Bel Thorne) and an entire gay planet (&#34;Ethan of Athos&#34;) it's like painting with half the colors on the palette.  Even the sex change winds up in a fairly conventional guy-girl pairing, although we'll see how that plays out.<br /><br />Still, she makes the whole thing so enjoyable that on some level it feels like anyone who doesn't like it is actively trying not to like it, or it's just really not your cuppa, as it were.  This many books in we have to admit that Bujold has something fairly impressive here, &#34;Cerebus&#34; crossed with &#34;Gasoline Alley&#34; crossed with Poul Anderson's Ensign Flandry novels, something that can play to a fairly broad audience with an appetite for science-fiction, yet can accommodate its own in-crowd as well.  It feels like the kind of thing people develop twee secret clubs for, and honestly, it's rather worth it.ould be the comic relief (a gender change, or any scene with Ivan, really) feels grounded in a way that would be difficult for anyone that lacked her longevity.

B007HACDLK|5|I love reading Vince Flynn and his main man, Mitch Rapp's adventures. I'm sure our country has men like this.
B00CO4GO7I|5|This is a great book about a true modern day American hero.  I highly recommend it.  If you saw the movie, you will love the book as well.
B00MO21WAY|5|Excellent story and incredible cast. We own all five CDs and several have been viewed more than once!
B0000026J6|5|This CD just blew me away, and I wasn't even a Cohen fan!<br />Objectively speaking, you won't be dissapointed, unless of course you're an idiot.
B0042JH0EE|4|It was nice seeing all these old songs played by a great band using the ORIGINAL arrangements. After all, you don't bring in three of the Motown studio players and tell them to learn new parts. The band sounds great but even on DTS the guitars, bass and keyboards are too often buried in the mix. No doubt Phil could have sung better 20 years ago. But he is being compared to recordings made by guys in their 20's who were always told to sing these songs as high as possible. Phil doesn't have the right look or sound and people singing these songs usually have at least some of the moves. But he succeeds because this is 60's pop. While James Brown, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding were making great R&B/Soul music, Motown was aiming for the pop charts because that's where the money was. Nothing wrong with that.
B00CIDCCX0|5|really cool drives you crazy but fun I would recommend this to anyone who like apps it dose work great
B004J4WKTW|5|I could almost taste the caramel in the air. I haven't read anything with such dreamy prose in a long time. Highly recommended!
B004WGGQPQ|5|My 10 yr old daughter loves it.
B00I2TV3NO|1|I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS MOVIE.
B00992CF6W|5|It's very cool
B005544TRQ|5|loveee
B00ECU34ZM|3|Wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but turned out to have several surprises that I didn't see coming.
B00FATEJYE|5|Injustice is the best game ever there is over a million characters.
B008YWY0HK|5|I love this movie so does my kids! Its one movie that ill never get tired of watching! Thank you Disney for making this movie!
B00845PRDS|5|First off let me say I have seen \\"worse\\" acting from Stallone, Arnold, Seagal and the like.  So for an action flick acting is never a criteria is it?<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie immensely.  Best action flick I have ever seen even better then my old fav Braveheart.  The best part about this movie for me was the fact that it had zero Hollywood \\"blockbuster\\" feel.  It just was a great movie and I loved the camera work especially at the end.  The only time the movie \\"went hollywood\\" was for part of the ending, if you've seen it I bet you know which part I mean.  I did enjoy the ending though.
B00OU2SBNM|5|Excellent recording (you can even hear him breathe! )  Such musical expertise . Exquisitely played.
B009LHWEKW|3|My wife loves this show. I think that it is very interesting that the two leads at some point in their lives expressed belief in God and Christ. Now that they have been doing this show, neither of them express that view anymore. Even Mark Shepard (Satan on this show and Jacob on LOST) believed in Christ. As a believer myself, I find the shows view that God, Satan, Angels and Demons are all the same. All are manipulative and have a jealousy/hatred of humans. This show doesn't affect my faith, but I feel dirty after watching it.
B003YV64OI|4|I read that you can unlock the 4th core on these, however I was not able to on this one. Regardless it is a good processor and fast, 3 cores seems just fine!
0307120007|5|I got this book for a friend of mine who is also becoming a grandmother.  My grandchildren LOVE it.
B00FHEP9XM|5|my old samsung came with it, and when i got a new device, I couldn't get used to the default keyboard anymore.<br />I tried swiftkey and that worked ok, but a lot of the predictions were off and did not have anything close in the suggestion bars.<br />can't have a device without swype now
B00PJ5AUCO|5|Is night 3 impossible
B00U7VDC7A|4|Good way to pass the time. Wish the crystals were easier to get rather than having to pay for them but on the whole a good fun game.
B004K4IZ3G|4|The movie was good, I enjoyed it.  But I'm pretty annoyed at only having the option (that I could find) to buy the Blu-Ray / DVD combo.  I really just want the basic Blu-Ray, nothing else, for a basic price.  This combo packaging sucks.
1623650003|5|When the story at first bounced back and forth, chapter by chapter, I looked and saw that I still had more than three quarters of the book to read.  I wondered if this was going to go on and on for the next 300 pages......kidnapped girl in cage, police looking for her.  As soon as Alex (spoiler) escaped, I thought,\\"Oh, too soon.\\"  I didn't realize there were going to be so many twists and turns.  The rest of it was a page turner.  The most unlikely event was that Alex had the strength and will power to get out of the cage, given that she was almost in a coma from lack of food and water.  But still, it was a very good read.  I recommended it to my librarian today when I returned it.  I just hope she doesn't find it too brutal and graphic.  I'll be generous and give it 5 stars.
B000JCQCW4|5|I can't think of a close second in this genre and hope that Ellen Burstyn continues to make more movies like this one.
B00A757EFW|4|Just like I remember. A little harder to do with your finger, but still fun.  Still haven't got past level two.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Like the game. I have not had any problems with this game. You will have hours of fun playing this game.
B00MUDYJ5W|5|Second tour with Mike Mangini, the sound is better than Live at Luna Park, watching this show in high def is awesome
0375842381|5|These books have to be some of my favorite books of all times. Those that gave it bad reviews likely had a negative reaction to the anti-Christian message of the trilogy. I have to admit that there are times when I almost felt bad reading it- essentially killing God is not on the list of things I would have thought I'd like to read about. However, in the end, I felt that it was actually a mind-opening experience. I would absolutely recommend these books to anyone who loves fantasy (especially those Harry Potter lovers!!). Plus, the books are pretty well written which is more than I can say for many other books on the market these days...
B00280LYHS|5|this book is exiting and entertaing. a great way to end the series and i cant wait for the lighting thief to coem out in theaters.
0385743564|4|Pretty good fantasy book.  I would have liked a little more info on how the Epics came to be - why only certain people were affected.<br />This is the first Brandon Sanderson book I've read other than his work on the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  I would recommend it to all readers who enjoy fantasy.
B00000FC5H|5|I've loved their songs for years - finally have my own CD.  Joanne
0684853523|5|This is a terrific book, for at least two reasons: King allows his reader to accompany him on a personal, albeit highly selective journey through King's life thus far; also, in the second part of the book, King demonstrates extraordinary generosity when sharing his reflections on the craft of writing. Over the years, I have observed him carefully during various interviews during which he revealed a delicious (often self-deprecating) sense of humor in combination with absolute seriousness about what effective writing involves, indeed requires. To the best of my knowledge, in this book for the first time King assembles and examines in great detail most (if not all) of his thoughts and feelings about himself both as a person and as a writer. I share his high regard for Strunk and White's The Elements of Style. Perhaps he shares my high regard for Zinsser's On Writing. King's own On Writing would be a perfect holiday gift for anyone, for a younger person especially, who has already demonstrated some talent as a writer and is serious about improving the skills of craftsmanship. This is also a book anyone will read with pleasure, perhaps with joy. That was my own experience.<br />One final point: King leaves no doubt about the enormous difficulties of writing well. I am reminded of Rod Steiger's response whenever aspiring young actors request his advice. He asks them if they want to be an actor or if they have to be an actor. \\"The longer it takes for them to answer that question, the less likely it is that they will succeed.\\" Hemingway once explained that he wrote because he had to \\"get it out.\\" Those who have to write will write. King's book can help them to write better. For everyone else, King's book can help them to read with greater awareness as well as appreciation of those who write well. And all will get to know this best-selling author in the process.
B00B2V66VS|1|I played a few times, and it was great until it stopped working on my kindle fire. I wish I could play it!
B000066NW0|5|this song was very well written and i liked watching the video it really caught my attention. It shows that you shouldn't care about what someone looks like from the outside.
B006LSZECO|4|Ending drove me nuts.  He bailed.
B0012GMW0C|4|make no mistake. this ain't 'faithfully' and 'i'll be alright without you' this is some San-Francisco mix of psychedelia/heavy metal/fusion/santana-esque soul ! founding member gregg rolie (vocals/keyboards) delivers the goods  on 'in a lifetime'- a track that reminds me of my favorite pink floyd song 'echoes'. kohotek, another amazing track,is where schon's guitar really shines and is reminiscent of mahavishnu or early al dimeola. neil schon's guitar playing is front and center & all over  this album (later, he'd have to take the back seat to the radio friendly pop of certain pretty boy chanteuse by the name of steve perry). like other reviewers have mentioned-don't pick this up if you are looking for a hits collection, don't get this. you wanna go on a \\"journey\\"?? a real journey-not that eighties pop rock fm friendly -band- of -cuddly- mtv -sweethearts- from -the -early- eighties-journey?? stylistically very reminiscent  to the rolie-schon lineup of santana band.
B001UV4XIS|5|So I will be honest with you, I'm such a HP lover I didn't read the last 150 pages of the last book, yes I waited 3 years to see it on screen because I didn't want the movie to be ruined I wanted to see it for the first time not already know what happened. I did see this in the theater and cried the whole movie because it is just that awesome of an ending. Not to mention bring everything from book 1 full circle so even if you are only a movie fan of HP and haven't read the books, you will still understand everything going on. The 19 years later part was poorly done on the makeup/technology side. But at least you get the idea of what happens to everyone.<br /><br />After you see this movie you will want to go to Universal, like I did and experience the whole Harry Potter!
0385344325|5|Child reached back to 1997, when reacher was still in the army.  he was sent on his next adventure to arkansas and tennessee, to find who was responsible for a death near an army base.  the action takes place in the adjacent small town with a beautiful sheriff, who provides the romantic interest.  vintage reacher - tough as ever.
B000GFLKF8|4|I was pretty doubtful upon seeing that this movie was directed by Spike Lee, I have seen some of his early films and found them to be unsatisfactory.  But with \\"Inside Man\\" he creates a unique point of view that just adds to the stellar cast and excellently written plot.  It had lots of twists and turns that kept me interested.
B004WR125O|4|not sure why i bought it yet!
B006IGZWB2|4|It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was certainly worth the money I spent to rent it.
B00IG2DOKM|4|This game is addictive, easy to play and a lot of fun. It does require patience, strategic thinking and time. You have spend money if you want to lrogress faster, though
B001U0HBPQ|5|THE IDEA OF GROWING YOUNGER IS ALWAYS INTERESTING<br /><br />THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE /DONE IN A GOOD WAY<br /><br />BRAD PITT ALWAYS DOES GOOD WITH HIS TALENTS<br /><br />WOULD RECOMMEND
B000IKM8UM|5|One of the earliest excellent acting
B000000LZV|3|3 1/2 stars        ....the parts seem to outweigh the whole on this one for me. While no one in their right mind could criticize this album for it's lack of punk ambition and fluidity amongst it's trio of players, the quite unique 43 song lineup does have some drawbacks. The songs are often catchy, and do vary in style-but through the album's continuously abrupt changes due to the material's one-versed nature, an audio pattern resulting in immersion apathy does in fact creep in towards this band's innovative sound. Do not let this less then perfect note convince you that this is not the innovative punk masterpiece it is generally perceived as being, because it is-albeit appreciated best(much like the band's format) in strong, short blasts.
0375422307|5|If you enjoyed Art Spiegelmen's Maus or Joe Sacco's Palestine, you are sure to enjoy Marjane Sartrapi's Persepolis.  The story telling is bold first persson, and the drawings are stark and  striking in their pure black and white sympathy.<br />I cannot wait until the sequel is translated into English.
B00DR0PDNE|4|It's worth $35.
014241543X|3|Gayle Forman had a wonderful idea when it came to this book, but does not give you enough time to fall in love with the characters. She should have included chapters like there are in Where She Went. Adam should have had more background that way you understand his life in the second book. Should have had more detail on her romance with Adam and why she stayed or didn't.  Overall it was a good book but could of been written better.
B000SINT52|4|There are two types of liberals (or were back then), those who did their research, and those who didn't.  I'm undecided about Michael Moore, but I can say that what he's promoting is mostly to be against Bush, and I agree with that.  However, I would suggest Greg Palast's film Bush's Family Fortunes: The Best Democracy Money Can Buy as a better film to show, if you want to expose Bush.  Greg Palast might not be as entertaining, but he clearly has done more research and interviews both sides.  Michael Moore does that as well, but he really tries to push them to look bad.  Greg Palast also lets the story tell itself, Michael Moore tries to tell the story.
B0015DYIH2|5|This book was incredible! Stephenie Meyer has to be the best author of all time! I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Really enjoy shows that depict this time period!! Costumes and set true to time period!!!
B00J2VSS0C|4|I wish I could make bigger to see better.
B000PC6A3E|5|great movie!!!
6305603847|2|I normally dont write reviews.....but seeing the amount of reviews heaping praises on this absolutely languid film, i feel rather compelled to ensure that people are not mislead. Of course it is my personal opinion but i think it is required of me. My contentions are that the acting is tepid, the concert scenes look corny (run like hell), and the pace is unnecessarily slow. There is no art here..for example, the scene where the school kids rebels is done stark(yet unpowerful) with no subtlety and when there is symbolism it isnt  very intelligent...(children going through meat grinders?). <br />i'm giving two stars for the animation which is visually stunning and conveys a very powerful message to the viewer....other than that...give this a miss....i wished i had a wall between myself and this movie!
B00B2OSZIW|5|Easy to get on and off when needed, which is not too frequently to be annoying. Makes a huge difference in holding the camera. My thumb used to hit the Q button often, but with this grip it stopped happening as it moved me just enough to the left to be in a good spot.
B00KWVZ750|5|I think that  this game is very colorful and very fun!!!! It has all the characters but I think I should be able to play on it with out internet
B006MW3V6U|5|I love it because I like to see challenges of both the wealthy and the less fortunate.  Getting to know the characters,etc
B00GINENG0|5|You should get this game... so why are you still reading this buy it...  (some time later) BUY IT ALREADY  honk :o)

B000B2YQX4|4|\\"Playing the Angel\\", Depeche Mode's most recent music effort is a lyrical journey filled with \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\". Despite the fact that a majority of this record seems to be suspended  in a state of wretched melancholy, there are quite a few songs that deserve recongition as truly inspirational standout tracks. High points include: \\"a pain that i'm used to\\", \\"john the revelator\\", \\"suffer well\\", \\"precious\\", \\"i want it all\\", and \\"lilian\\". Now...this is not to say that the rest of the album is undeserving of any praise; to the contrary, all of the songs thrive in riveting sounds and beautifully haunting vocals...this is a must have for all Depeche Mode fans and an obvious departure from the group's previous work with \\"Exciter\\"..... After a few careful listens I must say I recommend it...
B001AGXEAG|5|Great DVD, a must own for any Beetlejuice fan. Made me feel like a little kid again. The special features also have a few episodes of the Beetlejuice Cartoon Series, which was a nice bonus.
B0045HCJ94|5|All time classic well worth the watch.
B008FPOIT6|3|Robin's Sloan's writing is effortless and the plot hammers along but half way through reading the book I got the  feeling that something was missing. I was enjoying the story - which is original and unusual - but there was something nagging at me that I couldn't put my finger on. Then I realised.....the characters have absolutely no depth. There's hardly anything about the characters' backgrounds - apart from their job history - and, most noticeably, there is nothing about their feelings. The main character who is a bit of a geek has a relationship with a gorgeous smart girl but there is absolutely NOTHING about how that feels for him. Even when she leaves him mid-way through, he doesn't seem at all upset. Perhaps it was an experiment on Mr Sloan's part to see if he could write a story that could keep you hooked without getting sullied by emotion but - for me - unless you believe in the characters you just give up caring what happens to them. It's a shame because I would like recommend it purely for the interesting technological asides but at the end of the book I only felt empty - like I'd read a book that had just followed a plot outline with no real life of its own. His character Mr Penumbra believes in the power of books, unfortunately Robin Sloan didn't listen to his own character and produced a book that lacked the emotional strength to make it important.
B008N1LL42|3|What’s it about?<br /><br />A fleet of ships is forced to do battle with an armada of unknown origins in order to discover and thwart their destructive goals.<br /><br />What did I think?<br /><br />With characters that are both cliched and two-dimensional, a loose plot, a very clumsy forced tie-in with the boardgame of the same name and transformer-like alien ships, Battleship is more advertisement loosely disguised as a feature film.<br /><br />And yet if you’re interested in mindless action over quality then there might actually be something here for you. Not for the discerning movie goer but it’s not a total shipwreck.
B0058VW36U|5|on samsung moment 2.2 - game is simple and yet complex with strategically placed stars that make u spend hours to obtain.
B00JND1LQW|2|I guess I just don't get the fun factor of this one.  I have only played a few levels.  If you get stuck, you're stuck with no way around it and no help.
B006LSZECO|4|Gone Girl was filled with unexpected twists and turn throughout, and I couldn't putti down.  The authentic dialog and character development put me right into the settings.
0140131558|5|Okay, so I'm only 30 pages into The City of Glass, but I just had to comment on the fact the the very first paragraph sent shivers down my spine.  I'm enthralled.
B004LROUNG|4|The Litigators is a good read. I enjoyed the characters and the interaction between them.  I have read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed the comedy in this one.  I found the plot to be a bit predictable but it was still enjoyable.  I would have given it five stars but it got a bit bogged down and could have moved a little faster.
B00GTCECVG|5|This game is fun and strategic. I love the part when you can attack yourself to see how good that you are. if you do have this game go get it it is just like clash of the clans!
B00AR1G3FS|5|On my system this is one of the finest reproductions of a concert that I have ever heard.
014241543X|2|2 1/2 stars  Character is not someone I care about. She's boring with no personality. She's a total spectator in her own life, so the limbo the book has her in is really no different.  Story is really about the main character's family, not her so much. There's far more about her parents' friends than her friends. No shortage of descriptions of her parents clothes, none of hers.  Parents are horrifying, pushing the girl to go on birth control as soon as she gets a boyfriend and fondly reminiscing about getting drunk. Also encouraging daughter to go outside her comfort zone and hang out in rock clubs (I thought in the US you had to be 21?), all while cursing. The book raises the bar on 'cool' parenting.  The PC was too heavy handed. &#34;This person was black and this person was latina and I know so many lesbians!&#34; OK, I get it, this book is your attempt to satiate your white guilt.   Character that was maybe mentioned a couple times randomly appears and everyone knows her? SPOILER?: What was with this Willow character? She didn't work in the hospital and all the staff were taking orders from her? Didn't make sense. And the Brooke Vega distraction was just plain stupid.  SPOILER: How on earth did she knows about Teddy? All the sudden she figures it out magically. Doesn't make any sense.  What's with the multiple discman references?  SPOILER: ambiguous ending which I HATED
B00NX73VL2|5|Classic Denzel; an Oscar worthy performance.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Highly recommended...Enjoy.

B007Z8ZKS2|5|An excellent book, it really put me in touch both with what it is like to handle life compromised by poor health, especially as a young person, and how difficult it is to be a patent having a terminally ill child. But the book is not depressing, it is filled with homour and truth.

0345803485|5|50 shades of Grey was the best book I have read in awhile. As an avid reader I like books that peak my interest and this book exceeded my expectations. The hype about 50 Shades was really good and lived up to it. I loved how the characters relationship develops and how much growth is seen in one of the main characters. I can't wait to read the next two books! And a tip for those who want to buy the book, I say read the first two chapters to see if you like it, because I think 50 shades is a book that you either like it or you don't.

B002BX4VEK|5|During an interview after having met and (apparently) spoken with Elvis,John Lennon stated that he asked him why he had stopped making music after his post army years in the early 60's. Interestingly enough,that opened the door for The Beatles and the surrounding British Invasion to happen. Yet Lennon made a good point. Elvis was more than merely a pop culture phenomenon for silent generation America in their youth. He was a musical figure-a truck driver who,through sheer luck of having Sun Record's Sam Phillips here him sing into an old \\"make your own record\\" kiosk. And we know the rest. The mid 60's had seen Elvis do one less then stellar film after the other. With Beatlemania on the rise? There arose the possibility that Elvis was on the verge of being washed up and very passe. Finally it was decided that the best thing for Elvis to do was to return home to Memphis. This time recording at Lincoln \\"Chip\\" Moman's studios with his \\"Memphis Boys\\" groups of musicians,including a hot horn section and backup singers. The result was one of the finest comeback albums ever made.<br /><br />  At the beginning of \\"Wearin' That Loved On Look\\",Elvis famously announces in a worn,horsed singing voice that \\"I had to leave town for alive\\"-before going into a galloping,rhythmic uptempo horn based Memphis Soul hump that extends right into \\"Only The Strong Survive\\" and the even harder grooving \\"I'm Movin' On\\". One of my favorites here is his interpretation of \\"Gentle On My Mind\\",an uptempo pop-soul melody with some funky clavinet accents. \\"I'll Hold You In My Heart (Til I Can Hold You In My Arms\\" and the epic \\"Long Black Limousine\\" both embody the deeper,slower soul sound more typical of a Ray Charles type production whereas \\"Power Of My Love\\" is a big,brassy and swinging uptempo number. \\"It Keeps Right On-A-Hurtin\\" is a thrilling country-soul hybrid while the doo-wop inspired \\"After Loving You\\" and the bluesier attitude of \\"True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\\" come to terms with more mid-tempo grooves. \\"Any Day Now\\" is an uptempo,string laden number that comes just before the iconic \\"In The Ghetto\\"-the ideal message song for that time. Of the bonuses \\"I'll Be There\\" is a gospel/Calypso based uptempo piece while his version of \\"Hey Jude\\" is sung in a mid range vocal I rarely here from Elvis. He even plays around with the lyrics a bit. \\"If I'm A Fool (For Loving You)\\" is another doo-wop ballad while \\"Who Am I\\" is stark,organ charged gospel balladry.<br /><br />  On the second disc of this set,we're presented with Elvis's follow up album [[ASIN:B00E3TV1IY Back In Memphis]]. This album contains some dynamic,uptempo melodic grooves such as \\"Inherit The Wind\\",\\"Stranger In Town\\" and \\"A Little Bit Of Green\\". Generally speaking though,this album goes from the juggular of the more heavily orchestrated string and backup singer drenched gospel-style soul balladry of \\"This Is The Story\\",\\"And The Grass Won't Pay No Mind\\",\\"Do You Know Who I Am?\\",\\"From A Jack To A King\\",\\"The Fair's Moving On\\" and \\"Without You (There's Nothing)\\". These find Elvis's vocals at among their most expressive,on songs that all express the cycles of romance through different and eloquent lyrical metaphors.  \\"You'll Think Of Me\\" is an electric sitar fueled uptempo pop/soul piece. Some of the bonuses on this are mono single masters of \\"In The Ghetto\\",\\"Any Day Now\\",\\"The Fairs Moving On\\" and \\"You'll Think Of Me\\". I'm no audiophile. But these sound genuinely fuller sound wise even to my very untrained ears. Of course there's his soulful hit \\"Suspicious Minds\\". And possibly one of Elvis's funkiest Southern soul uptempo jams \\"Rubberneckin'\\"-one of my persona favorite Elvis songs ever actually.. \\"Kentucky Rain\\" is a cineamtically soulful number I've heard few too many times. \\"My Little Friend\\" is light country-pop while the ballads \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\" and \\"Mama Liked The Roses\\" have the flavor of perhaps a more personal narrative about them.<br /><br />  Granted I've heard my share of Elvis's music over the years. Its part of mid 20'th century musical Americana. Right up there with Motown or the Beach Boys would be later on. But I've never reviewed any of his music,nor owned any of his albums until now. Much as with the case of Michael Jackson and The Beatles in my life? It was sometimes difficult to separate Elvis the musical artist from Elvis the phenomenon. What is mos enjoyable about the year and a half long comeback plan of Elvis during 1969-70 was how thoroughly musical it was. So Elvis was perhaps the most externally directed figure ever in the music business? This album presents him in an interesting position. While recent decades seemed to have found Elvis being dismissed as someone who made his fame on the backs of black artists who inspired his sound and act? The Motown,Stax and Chicago soul artists of the 60's had found success and began to innovate all on their own during Elvis's absence from non soundtrack recording. With music that's drenched in the funkier Memphis soul of the late 60's? It was a total reverse of Elvis's previous musical tract: now he had to benefit from the success of music black artists had innovated following rock 'n' roll. Aside from the musically generational cycle at work there? This is vocally and instrumentally an excellent example of Elvis Presely's music. And I'd recommend this to anyone just getting into his music.sic over the years. Its part of mid 20'th century musical Americana. Right up there with Motown or the Beach Boys would be later on.

B0053JJLLC|2|Wasn't well-developed enough to sell me on suspension of disbelief.  Disappointing for Crichton to put out a weak story like this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5|I love Angry Birds, and who doesn't? Angry Birds Rio is another great installment of a great game. My kids, 15 and 10, love having it to play when waiting at restaurants, stores, and other boring places! We play it on my Droid Incredible and have never experienced any lag time or problems with adds using any of the Angry Birds games, and this is true of Rio as well. Amazon App store installed easily and the game installation was also a breeze. Love that Amazon saves directly to the SD card, as I always have to move apps from phone to SD manually for most items on Android market.

B00ID96FPY|5|Just as Celtic Frost emerged out of the ashes of primitive black metallists Hellhammer, so did Triptykon out of the ashes of C.F..  After forming in 2008 and debuting in 2010, the Norwegian ensemble pretty much pick up right where frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer (a.k.a. Warrior) and Company left-off on their masterful 2006 swansong, \\"Monotheist,\\" on their second record. 2014's \\"Melana Chasmata\\" has as much in common with the doom, advant-garde, progressive metal genres as it does with anything blackened, a surprising fact when considering how influential Warrior's previous projects were to the black metal world. And heck, there is even a little bit of folk metal present, here.<br /><br />The end result is a musical opus that definitely gets better with age. In fact, this is true on two accounts: The fact that it gets more and more intriguing the more the listener journeys through it; and the fact that it gets better, revealing more and more musical secrets, with repeat listens. And this result of getting better with age makes \\"Melana\\" possess an undeniable sign of long-lasting quality. What better way is there to describe an album that might be a challenging musical statement, but one that is ultimately much more rewarding than most of the meaningless, paper-thin fluff put out by many a metal band in this day and age?<br /><br />The set kicks off with the sharp, piercing sound of a wall-of-guitar feedback before grooving into a solid main riff. \\"Tree Of Suffocating Souls,\\" the blistering, belligerent, and thrashy opener, is a little misleadingly heavy, but it nonetheless sets the tone of the album well, with a pulsating, pounding wall-of-sound and harshly barked, yet intelligible vocal line. It also lets fly a pair of wah pedal-harassing solos, and even goes so far as to interweave in a distinctly Middle Eastern-flavored lead, into the mix, sounding not unlike Nile. And yes, in another move also similar to that band, \\"Tree...\\" does also eventually grind to an ominously doomy dirge (complete with grumbling bass notes); but for the most part, this is an up-tempo and aggressive opening blow.<br /><br />From there, \\"M.C.\\" transitions through one of its most memorable moments in \\"Boleskine House,\\" which utilizes an extremely gloomy and doomy ambiance with its mournful bass/drum intro. But this is then replaced by a bouncy, reverberating, tom-tom-heavy drum fill and a few angularly crunchy guitar licks and a sparse bit of nicely melodic leads. With that said, however, it is actually the tune's use of gentle, heavenly female backing vocals that stand out the most, here. They are a splendid contrast to Tom's portentously dark, spoken word growls, and in the process of creating a heavy pseduo gothic metal vibe, end up also creating a really, really memorable vocal pattern. Those hauntingly clean, siren-like backing vocals (from Slajh) are again used to wonderful effect in the album's bookending piece, \\"Waiting,\\" working like a charm as they offset Tom's dueling, sing-speak vocal whispers, and drawing the listener into a trance with its terrifically morose, dark, and sludgy soundscape. And the hell of it is, the tune also features a Gregorian chant-like vocal refrain that helps to make the arrangements even more unforgettable.<br /><br />Another one of the album's other more memorable moments is found elsewhere, in track three, \\"Altar Of Deceit,\\" which finds a few lonely keyboard keys being replaced by an up-tempo (but nevertheless always still restrained and kinda doomy-sounding) dirge where an ominous, doom-heavy guitar lick and thumping drum beat do battle against some of Tom's most brutal, dissonant, and rabid-sounding vocals. But the ensuing song, \\"Breathing,\\" is  not too shabby, either. It opens on a purely doom metal-derived note before suddenly adopting a rapid-fire, blast beat-esque drum fill that proceeds to launch the listener into a disorienting whirlwind of blistering thrash riffage, dexterous drumming, and growly, guttural vocals. As such, this number actually has as much in common with the death metal genre as with anything else -- at least until the mid-point, at least, when the song drops in another sudden curveball. See, from about the two and-a-half minute mark on out, \\"Breathing\\" becomes a more-controlled chugger that actually evokes some power metal stuff (yes, you read that right!). And a scorching, frenetic guitar solo (which would also be home on many-a-power metal record) tops the whole thing off, before leading back to its death metal-leaning ways in the outro.<br /><br />A much more subdued and serene vibe is created by \\"Aurorae,\\" with its softly-plucked strings, harmonic leads, and restrained, non-threatening drum beat. As such, this track might feel like just a short little interlude piece, but it is actually much more than that -- it is more like a fully involved, and thoroughly fleshed-out song with some undeniably powerful and memorable overtones. And it flows perfectly into \\"Demon Pact,\\" another menacingly dark, heavy, and almost purely doomy exploration adorned a brutal, prominent, and propulsive bass line. And it is all underpinned by some whiney, high-pitched guitar sound effects and a rhythmically dramatic-sounding drum beat.<br /><br />Moving along, \\"In The Sleep Of Death\\" is another extremely opaque and forebodingly doom-soaked number, this one repeating some more of those spiraling, trance-inducing guitar notes found in the above-described \\"Demon Pact,\\" and augmenting them with strong, grumbling bass lines and thudding percussion. \\"Sleep...\\" is also of note from a vocal standpoint, as it mostly consists of the morbid, spoken variety, but also includes the use of some foreign-language singing, as well as some of Tom's most dissonant and extreme, black metal-influenced rasps and shrieks.<br /><br />And wrapping up the set is one final song in \\"Black Snow,\\" a piece that clocks in at twelve-and-a-half-minutes in length, thus making it the arguably biggest highlight of the album, and its indisputable pinnacle.  Here, the guitars take turns pounding out momentous, doom-soaked power chords and spinning dramatic, melodic backing leads that end up sounding not unlike something a snake-charmer might play. Some more vocal variation finds its way into \\"Black Snow,\\" too, as it does also include some shrill, unnerving black metal screams, anguished, death metal-tinged growling/bellowing, and a memorably repetitive, chanted refrain. And heck, it even goes so far as to include an honest-to-god chorus, and a pretty darn catchy one at that! And it all flows right back into the song's heavy roots by dropping a densely sludgy, chunky, churning stoner/shoegazing riff slice into the mix -- and it is easily the most memorable and devastating riff you will found in this effort's whole sixty-seven-and-a-half minute playing time!<br /><br />True, as with any Triptykon release, one cannot help but compare this one to the works put out by predecessors Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. And admittedly, when doing so, the record does come up a tad short. And plus, it is also true that there are very few songs present, here, that are immediately accessible or even listenable. But as any metalhead worth his salt would tell you, that is not necessarily a bad thing. And if any of that implies that \\"Melana Chasmata\\" is a disappointment, it actually shouldn't. This, in fact, is nothing if not a pure, unmitigated success, and one mighty tasty (and therefore satisfying) progressive doom/black/advante-garde metal milkshake.cals. As such, this number actually has as much in common with the death metal genre as with anything else -- at least until the mid-point, at least, when the song drops in another sudden curveball. See, from about the two and-a-half minute mark on out, \\"Breathing\\" becomes a more-controlled chugger that actually evokes some power metal stuff (yes, you read that right!). And a scorching, frenetic guitar solo (which would also be home on many-a-power metal record) tops the whole thing off, before leading back to its death metal-leaning ways in the outro.<br /><br />A much more subdued and serene vibe is created by \\"Aurorae,\\" with its softly-plucked strings, harmonic leads, and restrained, non-threatening drum beat. As such, this track might feel like just a short little interlude piece, but it is actually much more than that -- it is more like a fully involved, and thoroughly fleshed-out song with some undeniably powerful and memorable overtones. And it flows perfectly into \\"Demon Pact,\\" another menacingly dark, heavy, and almost purely doomy exploration adorned a brutal, prominent, and propulsive bass line. And it is all underpinned by some whiney, high-pitched guitar sound effects and a rhythmically dramatic-sounding drum beat.<br /><br />Moving along, \\"In The Sleep Of Death\\" is another extremely opaque and forebodingly doom-soaked number, this one repeating some more of those spiraling, trance-inducing guitar notes found in the above-described \\"Demon Pact,\\" and augmenting them with strong, grumbling bass lines and thudding percussion. \\"Sleep...\\" is also of note from a vocal standpoint, as it mostly consists of the morbid, spoken variety, but also includes the use of some foreign-language singing, as well as some of Tom's most dissonant and extreme, black metal-influenced rasps and shrieks.<br /><br />And wrapping up the set is one final song in \\"Black Snow,\\" a piece that clocks in at twelve-and-a-half-minutes in length, thus making it the arguably biggest highlightof the album, and its indisputable pinnacle.  Here, the guitars take turns pounding out momentous, doom-soaked power chords and spinning dramatic, melodic backing leads that end up sounding not unlike something a snake-charmer might play. Some more vocal variation finds its way into \\"Black Snow,\\" too, as it does also include some shrill, unnerving black metal screams, anguished, death metal-tinged growling/bellowing, and a memorably repetitive, chanted refrain. And heck, it even goes so far as to include an honest-to-god chorus, and a pretty darn catchy one at that! And it all flows right back into the song's heavy roots by dropping a densely sludgy, chunky, churning stoner/shoegazing riff slice into the mix -- and it is easily the most memorable and devastating riff you will found in this effort's whole sixty-seven-and-a-half minute playing time!<br /><br />True, as with any Triptykon release, one cannot help but compare this one to the works put out by predecessors Hellhammer and Celtic Frost.

B0013816GK|5|For all the fine performances of the Verdi 'Manzoni Requiem' this 1989 recording with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, the Ernst-Senff-Chorus and the perfect quartet of American soloists - Sharon Sweet, soprano, Florence Quivar, mezzo-soprano, Vinson Cole, tenor, and Simon Estes, bass - is for this listener the finest.  Few conductors can match the sense of hallowed greatness of this work that many feel is Verdi's greatest 'opera'. In this performance he captures all the drama, the terror of the final day of judgment, the antiphonal brass effects that come through well in this superb sonic display, and at the same time he is able to offer the most tender moments of the work with a hushed reverence that calls for a unified approach from all of his resources.<br /><br />To say that the Berlin Philharmonic plays well for him is too obvious; that the chorus rises to the broad spectrum of dynamics with complete commitment is likewise not surprising.  What is a revelation here is the manner in which Giulini worked with each of the soloists to mold his uncanny interpretation.  Sharon Sweet has the power for the declamatory passages as well as the gentle pianissimos of her exposed solos. Florence Quivar's voice seems to have no breaks at all between the high and low ranges of her demanding role; her voice is pure gold.  Vinson Cole may seem an odd choice for a Verdi work, but here he makes the tenor solos and participation in the quartet clarion clear with a voice that never feels strained or less than beautiful. Simon Estes is a true bass who is able to utter the haunting 'Mors stupebit' in a manner that makes all other basses seem superficial in their delivery.<br /><br />The recorded sound is rich and immediate; perhaps choosing to record the work in the Jesus-Christus-Kirche in Berlin adds to the sonic splendor that makes the Requiem seem even more credible a work.  This is a recording that deserves all prizes it has won and should be part of the library of every music lover.  It is definitive!  Grady Harp, November 09library of every music lover.

B00004LN16|5|This is where AC/DC started, man. All drive-hard blues riffs tangled up in hard-end rock n roll. Throughout the 80's, they got more into the \\"heavy metal\\" phase all bands were going through. Stiff Upper Lip is a great blues album from a great blues-rock band. I suggest you buy it as soon as possible. After all, you wouldn't want to miss out would you?
B005CWRB44|3|Perfect for my wife's handbag or key chain. My only negative comment is on the cost of the battery. At a national drug store chain I paid nearly $11.00 for one battery. Checkout various prices online for a better deal on batteries.

Lou's best record since Berlin -which was also misunderstood at the time and now ranks as one of the best works of art of the 20th century. We will see this rank as some of the best art of the 21st. Kudos to Metallica for having the balls to make this record despite their mostly ignorant fan base (based on their fans comments on here) .

0380729407|2|I will get directly to the point, which is something the author found difficult to do in this book.  <br /> <br />This is one of the most disjointed, incomprehensible novels I have ever tried to read. I think this book is the most clear case of an author's vanity that I have ever seen. Do you ever get the feeling (when you're reading a novel) that the author is so very proud of the colorful language he has just scattered across the page that he can scarcely help himself from trying to top his last success at articulation? That is the way this book reads, like a perfect example of an author's vanity getting away from him.  <br />I grew up with this movie (and loved it!). This is one instance where I can honestly say that the movie was way better than the book. The book took too long to get anywhere, tried to introduce motives for characters' actions that never seemed to make any sense (to any normal person anyway), and was generally boring. <br />So, whatever you do, stay clear of this book. Jump, skip, skidattle-crack your way on down the road to another book (yes this is my attempt to imitate Bradbury's annoying descriptive style in this book). You will not find anything that you liked about Farenheit 451 (another book by this author) in here.

080017948X|5|Groundhog Day is one of those movies that I just don't get tired of watching. Despite how good movies like Casablanca or Godfather or 2001 are, you can only watch those at certain times and only so often. However, with Groundhog Day I could watch it practically every day and not get tired. This is amazing since a lot of the movie is repeated as a result of the plot line. It is interesting to see how Bill Murray gets in control of his life and destiny by living the same day over and over again. If I was stuck in the same day over and over again, I would want to have this movie to watch!

B00R143VHC|5|The 1st couple seasons are a little weak. After that it's 5 star in my book.
B00BEIYP8A|5|James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) were fiercely competitive Formula 1 racers (as was Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna) - to win at all costs but in the final analysis, this movie evolves into a deeper meaning of life and what &#34;winning&#34; is really all about. The experience, the tenacity, the dedication, the courage and most significantly, the sacrifices one is willing to make to win. &#34;Rush&#34; is well directed and well produced - the cinematography was dynamic, dramatic and, well, a Rush of adrenaline.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to have watched these racers (Hunt and Lauda) compete in many circuits but never did I have any real insight into the men behind the wheels. Hunt, flamboyant and basically without morals - Lauda, analytical and calculating. Two very different personalities but inextricably linked by a fiercely competitive bond. I will let other reviewers describe the actions, the sounds, the high intensity of motor sport racing in this movie - I wish to go deeper into the souls of these two men and point out the deeper meaning of life. I do hope that viewers will come away from this movie with a deeper sense of appreciation, more than merely the thrills and excitement of racing.<br /><br />Best &#34;racing movie&#34; I have seen............and I am almost 70 years old!

0679736646|4|Ubik, what is it?  That you will not know until near the end of this book... kind of a surprise.  \\"Ubik\\" is a world of precogs, anti-precogs, telepaths, anti-telepaths, and other \\"6th sense\\" individuals, and how they are used as a business.  In this world of the supernatural, the dead can be reached in \\"half-life,\\" allowing them to help run companies from beyond the grave. <br /> <br />The plot: Runciter Associates, which specializes in anti-precogs and anti-telepaths, is summoned for the \\"job of a lifetime\\" to Luna.  Unknown to them, this job turns into an assasination attempt by a rival firm.  Following the attack, with Runciter apparently dead and unreachable in half-life, things in the world are changing rapidly... but why?  \\"Ubik\\" leads the rest of the firm through a deadly ordeal, one in which most will not survive.  Who will live, who will die, and who is behind the radical changes being made to the world? <br /> <br />\\"Ubik\\" is a good read for pure entertainment.  Part of the middle of the book was drawn out, hence only 4 stars.  Recommended for anyone with some spare time who wants to read a novel.
B008JFUN50|1|When the director of this film brought out District 9 a few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic. An imaginative, meaningful, powerful story filmed in new ways.<br />Now he gives us a crude, simplistic, violent and essentially boring scifi story. Main themes are a class struggle in space, not exactly original, and some kind of Affordable Care simplification.<br /><br />What a let down. Jody Foster in possibly her stupidest role ever. Matt Damon as a non actor, impersonating an action hero, or some kind of high tech Mad Max, with a substantial lack of madness. The only similarity to District 9 is the seediness of the earthly environment, as opposed to the Elysium, the residential planet for the better class people.<br />I have tried to find a reason to give more than one star, but couldn't find one.

When I pick up one of his books, I know what I'm getting, otherwise I never would pay the money.

1594488916|4|Readers understand the mystique of books. Most of us have our own quirks and book obsessions, many of which revolve around our love affair with the written word. Often we, too, have book collections of one kind or another; a favored author, a special subject, a particular format. Yet Allison Hoover Bartlett's account of one man's bibliomania makes us stop short and rethink how we react to our treasured books!<br /><br />With a definite flavor of other books on manias, particularly Susan Orleans best-selling title, The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession, we are swept up in the story telling; in awe, and perhaps dismay that there really are people who will go to prison for a book. John Charles Gilkey was, and is, such a man. This book is his tale, a look at how one man bamboozled the antiquarian book trade and its members.<br /><br />Since we have a man in a black hat, there must be a white hat somewhere--and there is. Ken Sanders, a self-proclaimed \\"bibliodick,\\" has made it his mission to stop Gilkey in his tracks, and prevent the further loss of such timeless books as a first edition of The Grapes of Wrath. Allison Hoover Bartlett's first meeting with Sanders is laden with stories of such thefts, of missing incunabula, and the \\"aesthetic charms\\" of printed materials. From the very first chapter Hoover makes it her mission to discover what drives thieves such as Gilkey, and what motivates such unofficial detectives such as Sanders.<br /><br />As far as investments go, Sanders makes it clear that few make money collecting books and related ephemera. It is a field that attracts book lovers to collect and sell treasured tomes, simply for the joy of handling rarities, smelling the must and dust of books hundreds of years old, and of opening a book for the first time, and realizing that it is in mint condition, with no foxing or tears or spine damage. Unfortunately, this attraction isn't reserved for legitimate buyers and sellers only. There is no predicting who will be bitten by the book bug, and when characters like Gilkey come out of the woodwork, it becomes--seller beware!<br /><br />As the story unfurls, the characters and idiosyncrasies of each man become more obvious. The reader is alternately appalled and fascinated by Gilkey's constant justification of his behavior and his numerous thefts, and Sanders' personal fixation with preventing any more inroads by Gilkey on illegally obtaining precious, irreplaceable volumes . Sometimes Gilkey comes off as being levelheaded and sane, whilst Sanders seems hysterical and irrational. The lines blur and waver between the two protagonists, and we almost come to understand both viewpoints, despite knowing that Gilkey is wrong, and Sanders is right.<br /><br />So often, Gilkey is portrayed as feeling distanced from his behavior and misdeeds, citing insurance coverage as justification for depriving others of their property. Bartlett says, \\"Once Gilkey had rid himself of the (item) he felt he should also be rid of all blame.\\" This twisting in the wind is typical of many lawbreakers, who feel some off-the-wall validation within themselves for often-heinous wrongs. Bartlett tries to pin Gilkey down, but despite often expressing an antagonism towards dealers, he manages to slip out of any open confession of guilt.<br /><br />Sanders' place in the story is important, for, as Bartlett says, \\"...stocking his store is a form of vicarious collecting...\\" No matter which side of the law the central characters fall on, ultimately, their instincts are much the same--to have and to hold works of immeasurable importance, both in literary value and publication matchlessness. Moreover, whether or not we share those self-same obsessions, we can understand the driven personality and the want-to-have syndrome Gilkey displays. Bartlett does a good job of helping us see the shades of grey in the stories each man tells, and not only the value of the books stolen, but the value of the interaction between thief and seller. It is an ongoing tale--woven in our culture and our value system, so that no matter how we shake our heads at the excessive behaviors, we are intrigued, fascinated, and ultimately drawn into this storyteller's art.<br /><br />by Laura Strathman Hulka<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about womenwoven in our culture and our value system, so that no matter how we shake our heads at the excessive behaviors, we are intrigued, fascinated, and ultimately drawn into this storyteller's art.    by Laura Strathman Hulka  for Story Circle Book Reviews  reviewing books by, for, and about women

B00KWVZ750|5|love it
B000BGH22W|5|It seems strange that some fans are so narrow minded that they cannot be open to a new composer. The soundtrack itself is marture and does not depend on a strong thematic through-line unlike the previous three films, which was for me always something necessary for the young audience. It should also be noted that themes had always been the strength from Williams, whose music bears similiarities to Wagner. Doyle instead chose to capture the mood of scenes and he does a splendid job.The overall tone of the soundtrack is dark, ominous and brooding. The book is dark, and so is the score. Doyle's music completely reflects the source material (unfortunately I have read in quite a few early reviews that it does not reflect the movie because Mike Newell butchered it, which is a shame). The score is original and new and should be given a chance by everyone.  I really hope that Mr. Doyle will score the next movies because things will only get darker with each passing book and the jolly score from Williams is rather out of place now. My only wish for the future would be a tiny bit of thematic development and no songs at the end. They distroy the mood completely and should be skipped.
0783225903|5|One of Gilliam's best, in it's various forms it clearly shows how interference in a fine director's vision and intent for the cut can make or break a film of this quality.
B009LMTDL0|4|This book was recommended to me by two women who I respect who had high praise for it. I like and agree with what Ms. Sandberg says but I do not think she needed a whole novel to say it. However, I understand that as an article it wouldn't reach as wide an audience as it has. And I think there are women who need to know that it is OK to come off the wall and take a seat at the table. I challenge the notion that this book is for ALL women and instead for women who haven't already been mentored to know they are equal to their male counterparts and need to make sure their behavior reflects that attitude in a positive and productive way.

B008N5UX9M|4|Firstly ,<br /><br />Unlike almost all the other reviewers I like the vocals. One thing that I personally tire of is the macho grunting and growling lead singer thumping his chest on top of a throbbing metal band... to me its overkill and nothing of the brilliant light and shadow that I enjoy. This singer isn't competing with the band and it allows me to enjoy the music without being screamed at!!<br /><br />The CDs enhanced feature is a couple of variables in downloading to (in my case) iTunes.... a higher quality download and another version with 2dBs louder.  This is a very cool and interesting option that will become far more standard soon...<br /><br />Bravo to Steve Harris for not duplicating Maiden with another Bruce belting away... again its a matter of taste but I wanted to vote yes.
B002MQYOFW|5|Amazing. Full of detail,drama,romance,just.......amazing. I was stuck to this book, literally i could not stop reading it. The best book ever

B0060ZJ7BC|5|Unlike what you might think, this is not a baseball movie. OK, it is based on the true story of Baseball manager Billy Beane but the movie is made so it might as well be based on a basketball, football or stock-trading or just any other topic, because the true story behind this movie is how one man's vision and leadership managed to change his team and essentially to change the game (to some extent).  I like that the movie doesn't make Brad Pitt's character perfect. It shows some flaws and it certainly doesn't make him right all the time but eventually it is his leadership and vision that change the team and in every minute it's clear (in the movie at least) that everything that's going on in his team is his responsibility.  The entire cast is brilliant including every actor and actress in every little role. Too bad Robin Wright (no more \\"Penn\\" there...) only gets a small part. She is very good.  This is one of this year's best movies out there. I hope it will get some Oscars but I wouldn't count on it because it's not \\"Hollywood\\" enough.
B000002H2H|5|Superior to Master of Puppets in some aspects this is simpley one of the greatest if not THE greatest metal album of all time. Superb lyrics. Electrifying instramentals. Sharp production. Huge influence on my life. Connects with the anger and confusion of youth in ways few albums can. You will not regret in any way purchasing this flawless recording.
B0065RIJ3W|5|A must read if you are serious about starting an aquaponic system. Great detail and excellent step by step book

B00653FC2W|5|This was Michael's last album and I would have brought it no matter what the quality of the music was. I enjoyed listening to it and recommend it to all Michael Jackson fans whether you admit it or not.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|Jeffery Archer has a way of creating his characters. So they fell like real people. The story line becomes personal immediate. This last sequel in the Clifton Chronicals continues to entertain. I anticipate the next book to solve the latest cliff hanger.
B00C5R7B0I|1|Seemed a little tedious. I've read much better by Cornwell
B007PT3QOQ|5|The game is so awesome and entertaining that I could play it through one-hundred times and NEVER get bored with it! Especially since POLAR BEARS keep on running around people in my town; but not hurting them, of-course. Although,........., I DO keep-on wondering where POLAR BEARS keep-on coming from...........
0440237688|1|Newberry Awards are most useful for telling a reader which books to avoid. This is an example of a 'book' that wins an award for appealing to literary intelligentsia rather than because it's a 'good read'. There's no sense of wonder, no sense of adventure, but everything is very *PC*.<br />Go buy \\"White Fang\\" or \\"The Yearling\\" <BR>Read something by Mercedes Lackey, R. A. Heinlein, H. Beam Piper or David Weber. But for goodness sake, please don't buy this book on the same principle of *not* feeding stray cats. It only encourages them to stick around and reproduce.
B00BK5D95C|2|Take note of other lower star reviewers, believe them, check a few whole songs on youtube, and with a sliver of discernment you will most likely find that this album is not even close to what the review average has it appear to be. The 'singer' over done, over sung, imposing and abrasive, weaves a vapid thread of 'lyrics for the sake of making self glorified noises' throughout and in the forefront of every song.  This is an attempt at being deep by every measure, in every song, this album is a load of post millennial trash that is tantamount to collage art.  Unoriginal, contrived at every turn, this album is worthless!  Do not by into the air headed reviewers, as it is clear they have never heard, or at least ever truly paid attention to any music prior to 2000.
B0039TD7RC|5|Without doubt this is the best rock and roll cd available today.  It is quintessential Stone's rock.  Tubling Dice, Sweet Virginia, and Shine a Light are unforgetable.  No wonder many of these songs are standard fare for Stone's concerts, even forty years from their inception. Exile is replete with songs that define the Rolling Stones as the longest standing rock and roll band in history and both the mood and tenor make it a timeless album. This 2010 re-release is rollicking good music, stunningly portrayed, which conveys the energy, enthusiasm, and pathos that has made Stone's music endearing for over four decades.  I am a true devotee of this band but as a reader if you are not familiar with the Rolling Stones buy this cd.  You will not be dissapointed and you will be in touch with the roots of modern rock and roll.
B008JGSM6G|5|i love this game then my mom asked to play now she loves it and so do I buy it dont waste ur money on onother lame game get flo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00D7OMNXS|5|Great
B00FN811SY|1|this is such a terrible app on the app store. I would rate 0 stars if I could. why would you put a Jehovah witness Bible on an app store when there is already the real Bible there
0345803485|1|This is so, so bad. Even the grammar is bad. Don't read it. Seriously. You'll think you want to, just to see what all the fuss is about, but you're gonna want to resist that impulse, trust me. Try that old Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty trilogy, at least she had an editor at one point.<br /><br />P.S. To all the fanfiction writing, self-publishing authors out there--if your characters are American, then don't have them speak like British people. If you're British, and you want to avoid this problem, make your characters British for chrissake.
B00ICN066A|5|Very well researched, brilliantly written, a must read to every thinking human being!  I strongly recommend this book. Lucien Castier
B004QL7K6G|1|I had to stop the movie about fifty minutes in, I was actually becoming embarrassed for the actors, especially Theroux, his character was the cringeworthiest.  The movie is great for film students wanting to learn how NOT to portray a romantic interest, because they made Theroux so foolish that I can't imagine how he'll receive future roles or be considered attractive.  Or maybe I'm wrong, Aniston seems to star in failure after failure and works steadily, so....<br /><br />Very, very unfunny and just plain strange movie, its shocking that they released it at all.  And, though I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of the cast members from the ancient MTV comedy show The State (which I enjoyed, I think I was the only one), I know that movies which they star in are usually not so great, so I was immediately suspicious, and my suspicions were correct.<br /><br />I have no idea if they--The State members, wrote the script, and I don't even care enough to find out, but I will tell you this; I truly could have gone without seeing one of The State members in full frontal nudity scenes, I'm not prudishly opposed to nudity, I just don't want to see him naked, thank you very much, its just too weird.  And finally, it was hard to watch an incredible actor like Alan Alda in this film, for a lot of reasons.
B00OPMI04M|5|Love the album /like I'm gonna lose you is my favorite and bang dem sticks
B000VI70X6|5|This girl knows how to perform, so much so I signed up for her fan club,  and will donate money for her projects.
0061251305|5|Of all the silly business books I have read over the years.   This one is not just another fad.  I found it to be a long term guidance for both business and my personal life.  I have made it a \\"must read\\" for all my middle managers in my company.
B00KWVZ750|5|Really had fun playing this game! I also enjoy when a company does something different. Not hard to start gets challenging as you go.
B00AMBM9MO|3|I thought it was funny in some parts, despite the fact you see most of the funny parts in the trailer(s). It's on par with the family guy humor. If u like Family Guy then you'll love this movie.
B00846REIS|4|Liked Bared to You:  A Crossfire Novel better than the best seller Fifty Shades of Grey;  felt the writing was enjoyable.
B000MURAAG|5|Very neatly typeset stories in a hardcover format. What more could a Holmes fan ask for? A little tough to find a new copy. I bought a used one in mint condition. A nice addition to your SH collection
B00H58VGIA|4|Excellent historical fiction...a really good read!
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like this game because it's easy to pick up, and great for a mind that likes to solve puzzles
B00S24RSBK|5|Sufjan's most straightforward and emotionally rich album yet. A very thoughtful album, and certainly my new favorite of his. Not only is the writing excellent and heartbreaking at times, it is very much an album of hope. The fact that he created music out of so much sadness is itself hopeful. And what beautiful music it is. Sufjan's musicianship here departs from his recent ostentatious efforts and brings Sufjan back to his roots from the Seven Swans days: straightforward, excellent songwriting, skillful playing, and near-perfect production.<br /><br />Why can't there be more of those near-perfect albums in my collection? If you know of any, please comment here and share. In the meantime, I'll start again at track 1...
0307592731|5|This was a thoroughly enjoyable book.  It hooked me from the very start, and did not let go until I traveled the entire trail with the author.  This is a book of self  knowledge and self punishment.  The author challenges herself to a trek very few of us would undertake.  Not only is the trail extremely difficult to hike, but she is a novice and makes many errors of judgement along the way.  Somehow, Strayed found a way to keep this interesting and meaningful throughout.  I would recommend it for those on their personal Odessey, for those who embrace Nature and just as an excellent read.
0545265355|5|I bought the hunger games boxed set & the books are amazing ! I live in Hawai'i so things always takes foever to ship or they just flat out don't ship to our state , but I received m order very fast  it was ink a week! & it was worth every penny ! I highly recommend this book for all ages ! It was simply amazing ! What I liked most about the box set is thy you jaw all the books, there so good that you would die if you didn't have the next one !! So go for the box set !
B002FOQY04|5|Kid Cudi is an amazing, smart rapper. All his songs have such deep meaning. Highly recommended.
B00FX8FY14|5|I love this song! It has great base and background sound. It is very good for a great workout! Awesome!
B00HDMMISA|5|Love the way she tells stories and develops the characters.  This was my favorite by her so far.
B00BESKTMG|4|The plot is interesting but it has a few holes here and there. The soundtrack though is perfectly mashed with the action. That's what makes the movie.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5|The original greedy spiders is my favorite game app. Greedy spiders 2 is just as good. I always try to get 3 stars on every level. Can't wait for the next greedy spiders. I already finished 2.
B00CTSDDVO|4|It's Star Trek, it's 3D, what's not to like?
B003ZZAXNG|4|This CD is no more or no less than I expected. It is what it is.
B00G9QLP9Y|4|I love the street view, when following the map and switching to street view, it's far more enjoyable than mere GPS alone
B0000CDLA7|3|Seems like most reviewers are at extreme odds with TOT.  Is it 5 stars or 1 star?  To those who see TOT as a betrayal to the DT legacy, GET OVET IT!  This is progressive rock/metal.  It's supposed to be different each time out.  Most bands would sell their souls to create a CD like TOT.<br />This CD rocks harder than any previous DT offering.  The musicianship is undeniable.  It seems they're trying out-metal Metallica and nu-metal bands. For the most part, they suceed.  Sure beats St. Anger. <br />To those that see TOT as DT's masterpiece ... huh??  Love Portnoy and Petrucci but, how about some restraint.  The songs aren't strong enough to maintain this overdulgent showcasing.  It comes off sounding like speed for speed's sake.  I wonder, when in the recording process did someone say &quot;Screw the song, let's play really fast!&quot;  I could easily forgive the over the top approach, if it was in the context of better songs.<br />By the way, John Myung and Jordan Ruddess are brilliant with the little they are given. As usual, loved James LaBrie (and the vocal effects).  <br />TOT is a good CD ... not their best and certainly not their worst.  Strangely, it has made me appreciate Awake more.  Write better songs and no one will complain about how you play'em.
1567184855|5|Excellent book for a person with spiritual interest. It helped me a lot after the death of my wife of 54 years. His companion book &#34;Destiny of Souls&#34; is a must read also.
B005ZMTYTQ|5|I love the movie, and i wish tbey woild continie them, i am reading all the books, they need to make the other books into movies
0316789720|5|Purchased these on the advice of our schools art teacher. They have step by step instructions on how to draw things. Makes drawing accesable for all. My older son has some minor OT issues and feels he doesn't draw we'll. after using these books he was MUCH more likely to sit down and just color for fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I was hooked in Season 1. Great writing with lots of drama. Lives of the staff are explored in just as much or more depth than the families being served. Lots of dynamic characters and plot twists to keep viewers on their toes.
B00003CXXJ|5|Any age at all will definitely enjoy and absolutely love this movie! For the price of the DVD you get a great deal, tons and i mean tons of special features. The movie itself is so much better than your classic Disney movies of Cinderella or whatever. Fun happy movie that will leave you in a great mood every time you'll view this classic.
B003F9E5D6|4|Invictus is one of the most important movies that I have seen during my lifetime.  You will not be disappointed if you are a lover of history.

0060920084|5|I'll start by saying I'm a Bill Bryson fan, having started by reading his book \\"A Walk in the Woods\\". He got me reading books again after a very long pause.  As a 50-something babyboomer having grown up in Kansas before moving cross-country to Southern California 30 years ago, I found this book to offer a deeply introspective, yet hilarious, look at my childhood travels with the family.  Also, as a devoted road-tripper, I felt as if I was travelling right along with Bill in an adventure that many of us would love to take given the time and appropriate situation in our lives.  Bill's writing in this book, as well as his other books I've read, comes from a somewhat sarcastic style.  I think this is his best, at least the equal to his \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" bestseller.  The guy's got a knack for telling a story in a way that makes you feel instantly comfortable, want to travel with him - and see the humor,delight and yet experience insight into life's travels.  If you are the kind of person who longs for the open road and appreciates a very genuine and intellectually humorous point of view, you will love this book.
B000W4KT64|5|This movie is just plain fun. John Travolta demonstrates his considerable talents by playing the obese Edna. The entire cast is marvelous, particularly Nikki Blonski, a newcomer, as Tracy and Amanda Bynes plays the sweet, at first naive Penny to a T. Oddly, Michele Pfeifer didn't seem up to the rest of the cast, but didn't drag them down either.<br /><br />  In any event, the cast works, the script works, the movie works.<br /><br />  It's a message movie with a light heart. Integration comes to Baltimore in 1962, but more importantly so does young love for the chubby Tracy Turnblad. Nikki Blonski, a weighty gamin at 4'10\\" brings so much power to her role that it basically sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />  Only 19 herself, she exudes the vibrancy, innocence and desires of an adolescent. Really quite a performance.<br /><br />  It's hard not to look at Travolta in drag and not think \\"Geez, that's John Travolta in drag\\", but he still carries off the part well.<br /><br />  It's a singing, dancing extravaganza, just as outrageous as the John Waters original, only this time with singing and dancing. A lot of plain old-fashioned fun.<br /><br />Jerry
B00CKOYVG8|5|Fun game!

B009NXV2RK|4|This book is real page turner. I would highly recommend the book.I  Can not wait for the next book in the series,
B000286S8S|3|Wow, this cd is getting some negativity. Some comments: <br /> 1) It looks like some of the reviewers have never seen a greatest hits collection before. Of course it doesn't have EVERY ONE of your favorite songs. No collection would unless (a) you produced it or (b) it came from a one-hit wonder. If there's a song missing, buy it some from itunes or wherever. If Fair Warning is your favorite cd, buy it as well, there's only a one-song overlap. <br /> 2) The live songs: I think part of the purpose of this cd is to support their current (and future?) tours. It makes sense to show people what they sound like now, rather than what they sounded like 20 years ago. Just be glad they didn't replace the album tracks instead of repeating them (now THAT would suck!). <br /> 3) Yep, they messed up &quot;Finish what you started&quot;. Maybe it's a bad joke on the engineer's part? <br /> 4) Whoever listed this song on Amazon must be a fan, since s/he put out a better (if obvious) ordering than actually exists <br /> on the cd's. <br /> 5) Perhaps the saddest thing, this could have been done 8 years ago, if they had done it right the first time.  <br />  <br /> The songs: I much prefer the DLR era over the SH era. Nothing against Hagar, I just didn't like the direction they followed <br /> in the mid 80's. I think the tracklist is ok. There are a few songs by DLR that are missing, but I think it covers both periods fairly well. I'm not enough of a fan to buy the original cds all over again (had a few on cassette in high school), and this collection is a good enough taste of the band for me. Not spectacular, but not too bad. The 3 new songs sound like typical VH with Hagar to me, not horrible but not great either. Putting them right after eruption was Eddie's way of saying, &quot;we're back&quot;, I guess, but it doesn't sound right to my ears. I doubt I'll listen to them much and I very much doubt they'll get much radio play. Similarly, I don't much care for the 3 live tracks at the end, but I can see why they're there. Sammy does a pretty good rendition of &quot;Ain't talking about love&quot;, but I'll take the studio version, thanks. <br />  <br /> The tracklist: Here's where I have a real problem. I just don't care for the later songs, and alternating old and new just doesn't gel to my ears. The sound changed a lot after 1984 (softer, much more synth) so there is a jarring transition every other song which doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. However, ripping the dlr songs and playing them separately does sound good. As a result, the cd's won't spend much time in my player, since I don't want to program them every single time. <br />  <br /> The packaging: The cd digipack is ok. I like the design from Eddie's guitar. There is a tiny booklet stuck in the middle, which is pretty bad. There's a current picture of the band, and that's about it. No old photos, nothing really to look at. A fawning history of the band, which glosses over a lot, but this is par for the course. Nothing much here, folks. The cd's are pretty blandly designed, but as mentioned above, I probably won't be seeing them much. <br />  <br /> And finally, here's my tracklist: <br /> eruption <br /> you_really_got_me <br /> runnin_with_the_devil <br /> aint_talking_bout_love <br /> and_the_cradle_will_rock <br /> unchainedhot_for_teacher <br /> panama <br /> everybody_wants_some <br /> beautiful_girls <br /> jamies_crying <br /> i'll_wait <br /> oh_pretty_woman <br /> dancing_in_the_street <br /> dance_the_night_away <br /> jump <br /> why_cant_this_be_love <br /> black_and_blue <br />  <br />

0553801473|5|Excellent continuation of an epic fantasy series -- given the success of the HBO series, you've probably heard of these.<br /><br />Start with book 1 in the series (A Game of Thrones), as you've got to read these in order.<br /><br />The series as a whole is highly recommended for adult Fantasy fans, and absolutely for readers who are fans of the show.  Just be sure to buy / read the series in order!

B00005QATY|5|This is probably the best movie ever, or at least since 1971 (see \\"Harold and Maude\\", the best movie ever ever). \\"O Brother\\" is a classic movie, more like the classic movies of old than any modern movie I have ever seen. Even my grandmother, with whom I always watch Depression-era movies and who claims to never understand a single modern movie, likes this film. <br />     I am in love with the soundtrack, and I think it is incredible the way it has caught on. I understand that it would be a huge success with us bluegrass enthusiasts, but my cousin, my Brittney Spears, N*SYNC listening cousin, owns this CD. Go figure! I guess people have finally begun to appreciate TRUE GREATNESS!!! <br />     One of my favorite aspects of this film is its similarity, as I have mentioned, to great old movies like \\"It Happened One Night.\\" George Clooney is so like Clark Gable in this film, it's almost eerie. Not to mention the fact that \\"O Brother\\" is set in 1934, the very year \\"It Happened...\\" came out. A coincidence? I think not!<br />     The long and short of it is, this movie is specTACular, and so is \\"It Happened One Night.\\" If you are considering purchasing \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\", do so now, and get \\"It Happened One Night\\" too. Save on shipping that way.<br />     P.S. The title of this review is my favorite line from this movie. Just recently my friend told me a story: He was half asleep, wandering through his kitchen, looking for rug cleaner and pretty annoyed, and he found himself muttering to himself, \\"I don't want FOP, ...! I'm a Dapper Dan man!\\" over and over. Needless to say, he burst out hysterically laughing. <br />     The End.
B00EDOS6IC|3|I felt like it was a slight step up from their third album &#34;ABIII&#34;, but still nowhere near the quality of their first two albums.<br /><br />I think part of the problem is that while Myles Kennedy has a nice voice, it is quite a bit higher pitched than your average rock singer, so whereas in the first two albums he would use that to his benefit by some of the calming &#34;oooohs&#34; and &#34;aaaaahs&#34; and a few slower songs, on this album (and ABIII) those kinds of songs or portions of songs are absent and it's replaced with Kennedy's full on version of power vocals which starts to almost sound kind of nasally and whiny and doesn't complement Tremonti's guitar work all that well.<br /><br />The music itself isn't bad, but sometimes less is more, and there's just so much going on at once that it all blends together into noise instead of beauty.  Some contrast would have helped.  It's also still lacking those monstrously awesome guitar solos from Tremonti that we saw in the first two albums.  There are some good ones here, but again, not on the level of Blackbird.

But, it turns out he can't play it in his dvd player.  Back it goes.  What a waste.  It made the gift a flop for the holidays.  I felt bad.

Once you start following this journey to find out who killed and why, you can't just stop - the plot is fascinating with lots of twists. Highly recommended for those looking for fun, thrilling books.

0316666343|5|This book completey turned me into a blubbering fool.  It's so sad to witness the life of someone being taken away, but to have to see that person never grow and have to see her family from afar is painful.  I think Alice Sebold's writing was complete brilliance.  To make an audience feel pangs of pain is something most writers cannot do nowadays.  This story not only made me cry, but made me feel that life was more than just my routine schedule.  It made me understand that life was worth experiencing, especially since not all of us have a lot of time.

It kinda helps with understanding building things, and having to wait for it to finish. This game is so awesome!!!!!!!! I still can't believe it is free, no money needed. Don't just take my word for it, they're so many other people who like this game too. Join us, and we can all be friends in MLP.
B000W9399S|3|bought this based on numerous glowing reviews, but didn't think it was roaringly funny as expected..a satire on such an obvious, easy target isn't necessarily going to be as funny as I wanted it to be..there were some entertaining flights of imagination, but I was expecting a more amazing read, could be that to spoof a genre you need to incorporate many elements of that genre, making the spoof predictable.

B00C7E3EFU|5|As with most John Carpenter films on of his filming styles are darker and low lighting angles to add to the effect of the film. I own both the regular DVD and now the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray is clearer and more visually stunning. The darker scenes are crisper and the contrast between background and foreground is visually apparent. I think this gives the film a scarier touch (the ghost ship scene, the chapel scene) and ghosts stand out in comparison to the regular DVD version. Thank you.
B001QJUX24|5|tHE MOVIE IS GOOD AND IT IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE BOOK BUT STILL FIND IT INTERESTING TWO MORE WORDS NEEDED
B004MC8CA2|5|Easily start reading many different versions. My favorite is that it comes with the life journal reading plan and it allows me to keep all my notes and journals in one location. Plus it looks great on the kindle fire. Maybe they could add the option to purchase some of the Bibles that can only be read when you have Internet access.
B009UX2YAC|5|If you want a replacement for your temple run obsession, this is the way to go. I actually think it's a lot better than temple run and way more fun. APPROVED.
B009RI4FRU|1|Well, obviously this movie isn't for me. I couldn't care less for it. Looks like some people who get the movie like it. Suffice to say, it's not for everyone.
B004A8ZX28|5|This is a great movie, but I love Liam Neeson.
B00SH04286|5|interesting concept.
B00005LOUP|4|While Ron Howard is one of the best directors of our time, Jim Carrey is surely one of its most gifted actors. While he hasn't yet mastered the subtleties of dram, he is like human Play-Dough, easily able to mold into the most unusual of characters. The Grinch, while an odd, even uneasy character, may be Carey's most challenging role to date, due in large part to the mountain of makeup the transformation requires. Within the green fur and facial prosthesis, Carrey literally becomes the Grinch, enough so that Dr. Seuss's own widow personally approved of the production.<br />The unexpected treat in this film is the sweet on-screen relationship between the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who, played perfectly by 6-year-old Taylor Momsen. While Carrey is a delight to watch in his crazed Grinch routine, by the end of the movie even the Grinchiest of people will likely feel their hearts growing three sizes. While perhaps not a holiday classic, &quot;The Grinch&quot; will take an honored place in our Christmas viewing traditions, and should be a welcome addition to any DVD collection.
B00005JLS0|4|This is a throughly enjoyable, light as air movie that you should go to see when you just want to relax, smile a lot and spend some time watching Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have fun. No serious message, no real surprise twists and turns; but despite being totally formulaic it was a traet and we and the rest of the audience were often laughing out loud.<br />Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a dedicated environmental lawyer following in the \\"do good save the world\\" footsteps of her parents. Hugh Grant is the rich shallow playboy developer whose project she wants to halt. He shocks her by offering to hire her; they strike a deal to save her beloved Coney Island neighborhood center from the wrecker's ball in return for her becoming his counsel. Of course, she soon becomes his indispensable aide, eventually becomes disillusioned, and gives her TWO WEEKS NOTICE. Her relacement invokes jealousy in Lucy, the community center is about to be demolished due to George's brother's (and partner) efforts to make their project profitable after cost overruns, and Lucy heads back to her former life in her parent's cramped apartment.<br />Of course, what the moviegoers have always known is by now dawning on George and Lucy. Namely, they may be as different as day and night but will be miserable without each other. And, so, in the tradition of such feel good films, George overwhelms Lucy with the grand romantic gesture and after some initial confusion and ambilavence she eventually overcomes her doubts and recognizes her true feelings for him.<br />The pace is right, the jokes mostly work, and the supporting cast is more than adequate. So, go see this when you are in the mood for fun rather than adventure, drama, tension, action or deep meaning. It is about on par from the usual work of Bullock and Grant, but if you are a dedicated fan of either don't expect it to measure up to their best work; the material just isn't stong enough.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Fun. Easy
B00IRMQADY|4|Great movie Deserves the oscar for best movie. Tough to watch at times, but that what makes it so great.
B000MNP2KI|4|I had seen Daniel Craig in [[ASIN:B0009X7BDC Layer Cake (Widescreen Special Edition)]], and was very impressed with him as an actor. The curiosity factor was high when I wandered off to see \\"Casino Royale\\".<br /><br />Was Craig as good as some of the other Bond actors? No, simply put. However, this was his first Bond movie, and I think an actor of his skill will quickly gain a feel for his own interpretation of the character. Craig brings a certain ruthlessness to the role, and a gritty earthiness. Without the vast array of nifty gadgets, Bond is finally relying on his wits. Breaking into M's home was a nice touch.<br /><br />Balanced with that is Bond's sensitive side. I do not ever recall Bond falling in love before. The vulnerability made for a deeper character, perhaps the deepest since [[ASIN:B00004RG65 On Her Majesty's Secret Service]] with George Lazenby as Bond.<br /><br />The tension between M and Bond is plainly palpable, continuing one aspect from the previous movies with Brosnan. Another aspect of Bond that continues to develop is his sensivity and vulnerability. It is not emphasised, but it does poke through on the odd occassion.<br /><br />Bond spent a lot of time playing poker in this movie, and that was a bit of a drawback. However, the tension was maintained and well done. For anyone not familiar with poker, some of the game play may be a bit of a mystery. This section of the movie was nicely broken up with an awesome fight scene and some other elements of tension.<br /><br />Of particular note was the chase on foot between Bond and a bomb-maker in Madagascar. The agility and speed of the actor playing the bomb-maker was stupendous. The man could move like nothing I have ever seen. It was scenes and chases like this that made the movie truly great.<br /><br />Daniel Craig could be set to become a Bond actor of the highest calibre. If \\"Casino Royale\\" is anything to go on, I think we can expect some great things in the future.
B0015LBYMQ|5|Awesome!
B005LLSNNE|5|I don't have time for a long review.  Purchased this item cause I could not wait  for netflix any more.
0743486285|5|I bought this as a gift and couldn't stop turning the pages.  I was only going to take a peak and ended up reading most of it. The artistry in this book is amazing...and I'm not even a Motley Crue fan.
B002NUULNG|5|I was impressed by the quality of this movie. Most of the movie have been redone to HD. Some scene have been enhanced too. The original movie is also available on the disc. Purists will be pleased.
B003YL4LYI|5|This book really gets you going in a hundred different ways and leaves you hanging with tons of questions that you must wait for the next book to be finished written to possible get the answers.<br /><br />So Hurry Up George and finish it!
006202406X|1|I was so dissappointed in Veronica Roth after reading the last book. Aurthors need to realize that avid book readers of fiction read in order to escape reality. If I wanted realistic stories I would turn on the news and watch reports of murders and ebola panics! I understand she wanted to show Tris as finally learning what it was to be totally selfless without going for the total shock factor. I really liked this series until I got halfway through the last book. I think it soured the first two books for me! I don't think I can allow myself to watch the movies unless they make big changes to the plot on the last film!!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|a really fun game and just like flappy bird. it is a little harder than flappy bird but I always like a good challenge!!!!!
B007THA4FI|1|I found the book hard to read I had to work at it to read and I only read the first four chapters. It was like going to school and doing homework
B000XUBFE2|5|It didn't surprise me, but it does not mean it wasn't excellent. I enjoyed it, and suffered it, cried and laughed. A good story for a whole day of reading.
B00MB6IYHW|5|Awesome movie
B007PTJOV0|5|Love it. Mario was my favorite as a kid and this is so much like it. one of the best free games available.
B00HUNOS2G|4|I have loved this franchise since I watched the second installment, and Vin Diesel has developed his character really well. However, I am now and have always been dismayed at how science fiction is often reduced to slimy creatures getting killed or killing. This was a really really cool creature! But to have millions of them getting squished and shot and cut was just splatter gore, not sci fi. A rag-tag group, led by Riddick, staying in the line between skin shattering dark and cold and vaporizing sun (with Dame Judy Dench in the cast) gave me a science fiction movie I can watch several times (3). Wasting the plot from before and discarding Urban--a willing adversary--was a bad choice. Again, the character is more fleshed out now, less superhero and more reluctant force of semi-good. I like that. Just a little hint to Universal, we are ready for females who are more than sexual fodder. A great actress like Katee Sackoff should not be wasted in such a narrow role. I know Vin Diesel is open to better interpretations and leads. I look forward to the next iteration...
0553418025|5|I don't mean that title in a disparaging way, for I truly enjoyed the book. It flowed along very well, and kept the reader in suspense. All of the McGuyver type things that the protagonist did to keep himself alive and his \\"home\\" in good condition did tend to have my eyes glaze over at times. I realize that these things were necessary in order to keep the plot going, so I didn't deduct any stars.<br /><br /> It's been awhile since I've read any fiction about space travel and such, so I did find the book quite interesting. The writing is quite good, and the humor that the main character has kept me chuckling many times.
B00CHI5F5S|3|It was a good movie with a good cast, but way too violent for me! And kind of predictable too.
B00AE2J5HI|4|This was a nice period film exploring the life of prohibition in a rural county. Violence and bloodshed but still enjoyable.
1476719071|4|Great!! Thank you!!
B002MQYOFW|5|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It packed with everything I love! Action, adventure and a little romance. I recommend that everyone should read this book.
B0077SGMXM|5|Got this game free as the app of the day but after playing it I would definitely pay for it. I've been playing it nonstop and I love it! Fun for hours and high replay value. I'm going back through courses again and again trying to beat my score and unlock prizes. I rarely ever rate apps but this one takes the cake. Get it...you will love it if you like golf games especially.
B007SYWFRM|4|This is a very easy and fun game to play.  It's a game to play when you just want to sit back and relax.
B00029LNHS|4|This rap CD is very mainstream but at the same time quite excellent. Words can't quite describe the best tracks on the album. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) is track in the first batch of tracks that really gets you pumped and ready to dance. Sexy is extremely melancholy for Black Eyed Peas and has them touching on a jazz-lite tone. The lazy horns really do it for me. It's a favorite. The Boogie That Be (another fave) is very sexy. It's another track you can dance to and what Fergie says in the bridge might get you in the mood. ;) She sings wonderfully on this disc.<br /><br />If you like Rap with a mix of R&B and Pop, get this. There is also a Rock-ish song called Anxiety (Feat. Papa Roach) that my cousin LOVED when this CD came out. It's truly good stuff.<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Labor Day (It's A Holiday)\\"<br />\\"The Boogie That Be\\"<br />\\"Anxiety\\" &<br />\\"Sexy\\"

B000H5U832|4|Lightning McQueen, a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters including Sally, a snazzy 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, and Mater, a rusty but trusty tow truck, who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The animation in this movie is gorgeous, and the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. This is movie is worth seeing.

B00005JKDR|5|\\"Monsters, Inc.\\"? You want me to talk about \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"? All right, we will. \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", Pixar's fantastic and wacky comedy (its fourth movie), is one of the funniest movies ever made, animated or live-action. It's got elements of the Marx Bros., Mel Brooks, Chaplin and Looney Tunes. It has some of the goofiest-looking characters ever- no two monsters are alike. It has some of the best voice work ever, from big names like John Goodman and Billy Crystal to tiny, 3-year-old (at the time) Mary Gibbs. It has a most original story line, some snazzy designs, a warm kid-friendly message that's refreshing rather than gooey, and guaranteed laugh-out-loud gags that even leave this sober-sided writer rolling on the floor. <br />       The \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" story is well-known, but on the off-chance you've never seen it (for shame!), here it is: Welcome to Monstropolis, the only city in the world where humans are poisonous. Most of its inhabitants work at Monsters, Inc., the giant corporation that produces the city's energy by means of clean \\"scream power\\": the reaction by frightened kids hidden behind electronic doors! A team of \\"scarers\\", assisted by their door operators, create the screams, and if you have so much as a baby bootie on your body, it's time for the CDA (Child Detection Agency) to roar into the plant with a full shutdown by its headless yellow robots. James P. (Sulley) Sullivan, a huge blue furry creature, is the star of the scare floor, with help from his motormouthed green eyeball partner, Mike Wazowski. These are the characters voiced by Goodman and Crystal, respectively, and two of the greatest animated characters ever created.  <br />        All you-know-what breaks loose after a stray after-hours door is opened and a very cute little girl, who has maybe a five-word vocabulary, sneaks into the MI plant. The sequence where Sulley barges into a sushi bar (run by octopi) and the kid pops out of a bag is one of the funniest things you'll eversee- it's a \\"Kid-Tastrophe\\", as a hysterical Muppet-ish TV announcer says. <br />Soon, Sulley and Mike discover that \\"Boo\\", as they nickname the girl, is really a friend, and that people are not poisonous. For the rest, you'll have to watch it, and I'm one who could watch this every night. <br />       If you own just one Pixar DVD, \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is the one to get, not just because the movie itself is fantastic, but so is the bonus disc. Team Pixar has a great time showing off all their computer, animation and voice tricks with everything from storyboards to early sketches (Sulley was originally dubbed  <br />\\"James P. Johnson\\" and was orange). There are foreign-language clips (watch one five-minute sequence dubbed into everything from Polish to Portuguese- Lisboan and Brazilian), musical portions (Randy Newman's playful Dixieland-ish score and his theme song, sung in character by Crystal and Goodman, won him a long-awaited Oscar), even guest appearances by Sulley and Mike on everything from the ABC Monday Night Football opening to something called \\"Ponkickies\\" (an animated Japanese kiddie breakfast TV show). More than any other Pixar DVD package, the extras are a great show in themselves, satisfying everyone from the tiny tots to the grown-up animation geeks. For that matter, so does the movie.  <br />       I don't know anyone who doesn't love \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", and when you're done with it, you, too, will want your very own one-eyed green Mike to hang out with and do your errands. You'll also have a carload of catchwords (\\"Put-That-Thing-Right-Back-Where-It-Came-From-Or-So-Help-Me!...The Musical!\\") in your head and a great understanding of how, and why, Pixar truly brought animation into the new millennium. Best of all, this movie really is fun for all from three to 93. \\"Monsters, Inc.\\": it's a scream!
B000UBMWG4|5|The million dollar question:Is Deckard a replicant? An even better question: Out of all the characters in the entire movie who's not a replicant? Blade Runner. The movie. The myth. The Legend. This film was directed by Ridley Scott. Volumes have been written detailing the amount of work and effort poured into making this film. The set, the screenplay, the acting, and the soundtrack. The effort is clear and evident in every frame. This is science fiction masterclass. At the core it accomplishes the true purpose of science fiction: to inspire contemplation of the future. It is futuristic, enlightening, terrifying, and ultra violent. Blade Runner has the look and feel of science fiction films that came out during this time period. This one really set the standard high and reveals once and ultimately for all that modern computerized CGI is no match for raw imagination, meticulous attention to detail, and genius set design. Blade Runner presents a futuristic vision of what urban sprawl may be like in the near future. Everything is very cramped and processed including the human beings or replicants. The plot is pretty simple and straight forward. The story is about an officer of the law (blade runner) that is in charge of hunting and eliminating a group of rouge androids in a futuristic Los Angels. The androids have evolved and started thinking for themselves. The lead android is played with ferocity by Rutger Hauer. The role of Deckard is also one of Harrison Ford strongest signature lead roles in league with Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Other notable roles are played by: Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, and Joe Turkel. The soundtrack to film was created by Vangelis and is equally as visionary and an amazing triumph on its own. Many forces came together to make this film possible. Above all else this film succeeds because of the source material the screenplay was drawn from. Blade Runner is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. In connection to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep the movie Blade Runner presents concepts concerning creation and the very evolution of the human mind. This is a timeless concept presented beautifully in this film.ectric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. In connection to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep the movie Blade Runner presents concepts concerning creation and the very evolution of the human mind.

B002BJGYUS|5|While flipping through channels a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon Gilmore Girls. I recall when the series was first aired in 2000 and for some reason I never got around to watching an episode. What caught my eye was that Lauren Graham was constantly carrying around a cup of coffee, which so do I. After twenty minutes of viewing and listening to the snappy dialogue, I was now a fan. A few days later I went to a Target store in the city and found seasons one and two bundled together for twenty dollars.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is set in the small, wacky town of Stars Hollows, where single mother Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham), manager of the Independence Inn, is raising her sixteen-year-old daughter Rory (played Alexis Bledel). When her daughter is accepted into the Chilton Preparatory School, Lorelai asks her rich estranged parents for financial help due to the school's expensive tuition. Of course things are not so simple as her parents want them to have Friday night dinners with them and be an active involvement in their lives.<br /><br />Besides from Lorelai and Rory's addiction to coffee, I like their quirky personalities. Lorelai is a fun and carefree mother, while Rory is a Harvard bound book nerd. The dialogue between the two is smart, snappy, and more real than other scripted shows. There are other colorful characters on the show as well, such as Luke Danes who owns the local diner; Lane Kim, Rory's best friend (When the series started the actress was 27 playing a 16 year-old.); and Sookie St. James, Lorelai's best friend and head chef at the Independence Inn (played by Melissa McCarthy).<br /><br />In just over a week, I watched the entire first season, but I did skip over a few that I had already seen. Even though the show is almost twelve years old, I find it to be a bit of fresh air compared to other horribly scripted shows on network television today.
B003JSSPSY|5|I can't say it enough, this tv show is amazing. It's full of action, love, and magic. It's also one of the few tv shows out there that has a deeper meaning about the good of humanity in every episode. I must admit, I was one of the biggest critics of SciFi shows before I saw this. I still think I am to some degree but this show captured my attention and kept me hooked! It's so much more than a SciFi show. it's all around great. I definitely recommend it. five stars!
B00G34XP3Q|5|He is still laughing about &#34;doing this for a living&#34; as he said decades ago!!
B00005U11Z|3|If you're a diehard Journey fan, you will certainly enjoy this effort. The quality of the live production far outshines Journey's previous efforts. Sure, Steve Augeri sounds impressively adequate and probably better than Steve Perry would at this point. However, these songs are performed at least a full key lower than the originals and I found myself appreciating Steve Perry's old performances more after hearing Augeri struggle with some parts. Also, Augeri has the stage presence and dance moves of a drunken truckstop stripper. Nobody works a stage like S.Perry did. <br />Deen Castronovo is a student of the master, Steve Smith. Deen is more than adequate......he kicks a** !! He brings some much needed personality to some of S.Smith's \\"safe\\" drum parts. Jonathan Caine's stage presence is as cheesy as ever, Ross is flawless, and, of course, Neal is breathtakingly perfect and raw. He does need to lower his carb and fat intake, though.
B00AZMFJYA|4|It was good, but not quite as good as the first one.  I still can't accept the guy they chose to portray Scottie though.
6304080921|4|Bruce Willis has some excellent movies (Pulp Fiction, Nobody's Fool, Die Hard) some pretty good movies (Striking Distance, Sixth Sense, The Whole 9 Yards) and some awful movies (Hudson Hawk, Last Man Standing, Blind Date.)  This sci-fi thriller is one of his better ones, albeit not the best.  It probably does qualify as one of Brad Pitt's best movies, though.  Good Sci-fi, great plot twists, interesting characters.  Definately worth watching.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It is fun with friends
0399159347|4|I usually read historical fiction, but decided to change it up a bit and read this book. I really enjoyed it. I could relate to all of the female characters in one way or another. If they did not remind me of myself, then I knew someone like them. The book is quite funny at times, but tragic as well. I moved very quickly through the book. It has a great plot, well written, fast pace.
0060558121|3|Just finished American Gods, by Neil Gaiman.  I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman having loved Stardust, Neverwhere, Anansi Boys, and Fragile Things.  I am not sure exactly what I expected with this novel, but I do know that I expected a bit more.  There were some very bright spots towards the end, including the unlikely and unexpected resolution to a mystery, that saved the book for me.  I had a difficult time warming up to many of the characters.  I certainly can't complain about the writing; however, as Gaiman is a true wordsmith in every sense of the word.  The character of Shadow was interesting but not as compelling as I would have liked for the main character.  This is a difficult book to class, but if you are into Science Fiction and fantasy, this is probably worth your while.
B00VRYCGLO|3|Enjoy the game but close to impossible to complete without purchasing stars. Unless you want to stick with it and play 30-40 times.
B00BKBCF38|5|As a youth minister, I'm always looking for new, exciting music to play for the kids. We had a road trip coming up last month so I ordered this a few days in advance. The kids enjoyed singing the tunes. Johnathan particularly enjoyed the campy, yet moody sounds of &#34;Monstrous Clock.&#34; Little Ashley had a ball singing along to the oh-so-melodic &#34;Body and Blood.&#34; But for me, my favorite song, hands down, was &#34;Depth of Satan's Eyes.&#34; I love this band and appreciate all that they are doing. If we don't warn kids about satan, who will? Looking to book them for Easter next year!!!<br /><br />God bless, y'all!
6304712499|5|Love this movie!
B000000WJ2|3|The unimaginative title is the only bland element of this album.  Along with Mick's simultaneous Wandering Spirit, a surprisingly vital collection--more mood- and groove-oriented than his bandmate's, but with  consistently interesting lyrics and a melodic sense befitting one half of a  great songwriting pair.  Amazing in its spareness and how little Keef cares  to dominate--most tracks begin with only a drumbeat, and Waddy Wachtel  plays most of the leads.  Could have used another hi-octane number like  999--surprisingly, that's more the Jags department now.  Much more  well-conceived and produced than the spotty (and unimaginatively titled)  Talk is Cheap.<br />Note to Kevin, re 999 (e-mail no longer visible): He uses  this lyrical style often, popping out phrases that gradually accumulate  into a theme which remains slippery.  Something about $, drugs, and social  class, rather than the sap he often croaks about.  I think it should be  spelled &quot;$9.99.&quot;  Then again, they seem to be singing  &quot;99.&quot;  I don't think it's meant to be too clear--all the better  (unlike, say, Saint of Me)!
B00EGMQIJ0|3|It's been a while since I read it, but I found some parts hard to decipher or to predict what would happen next.
B0049IWQJW|5|kids love it
B00GT67UUM|5|Great game! Makes you think a lot. Sometimes I got the solution by accident - sometimes it is better to be lucky than good. I really like all the different types of &#34;cogs&#34; you get to work with.

B00D7Z4GQY|5|Loved Liane Moriarty's Still Alice and couldn't wait to read The Husband's Secret. Moriarty doesn't disappoint with a thought provoking tale that you will ponder long after you put the book down. The author refuses to tie things up with storybook endings and requires the reader to acknowledge that sometimes there are not clear cut right or wrong answers to life's questions.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I loved this Trilogy. I loved the movies..but loved the books even more. I loved the writing style and the characters. of course I watched the movies before I read the books, but I still enjoyed reading them.

B008AK8FHM|3|A little long winded in getting to the good stuff. A lot of technical medical explanation but this was to allow the reader to understand the depth this guys illness and to convey to the reader that this guy was indeed brain dead.  I think the story could have been told in fewer pages with less fluff but still a decent read if you are into this phenomenon.
B007X76Y58|5|Although many of the songs are sang by Depeche Mode frontman Dave Gahan, the sound is very different, yet soothing.  Melodies are dark and meloncholy, but it makes for great music.
B003O86FMW|5|The book was great - not as good as the first one - and not as good as the 3rd and final book.  however, I loved them all - and waiting for our libtary to get them - too expensive to  buy  now'<br /><br />Harold Stephens

B00192KCQ0|4|I've been a metallica fan for a long time. I've always been more for thier pre-black album thrash sound but then again i really like the heavy sound of black album as well. After St. Anger i wasn't sure what to expect but, being metallica, i bought the album and stuck it in my car. Once the main riff of \\"That was just your life\\" started I thought \\"Ohhh yeah, this is gonna be good.\\" and i wasn't wrong.      You will hear the trademark sounds of Metallica though out Death Magnetic. It gives us a little bit of everything. You hear a little bit of Justice as well as Puppets but also Black album and St. Anger. Now many Metallica fans were not happy with St. Anger but they have brought the musical exploration they did in that album into this album to give it a modern feel but with all the loveable metallica sound that many felt was lacking in the St. Anger album. Personally, i like it a lot.     This is a good album that is UNDENIABlY metallica. If you like Metallica, be it mainly the black album or all the 80's thrash, chances are you will dig this album. I don't give it five stars because it isn't a masterpiece but it is definately worth putting in your collection.    put it in, crank it up and bang your head.
B00BVYNSLC|5|I wasn't sure if I would like this show, but I was hooked after the first show.  Tatiana is such a talented actress that I sometimes forget that she's playing all the leading women roles.  She's outstanding.  And Felix is a wonderful counterpart to Sarah.  Some of the other actors aren't all that great (Paul, for example), but watching Tatiana play so many different roles is fascinating.  Definitely try an episode or two.
B00762ZPOQ|4|The DVD came to us in terrific shape and just as expected.  It played perfectly and we got it very quickly.  Very pleased.
B00DMM3WVM|5|I CHOSE THIS GAME BECAUSE A FRIEND RECOMMENDED IT, I AM GLAD I DOWNLOADED IT, IT IS AWESOME. IF YOU LIKE KILLING GAMES I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. NON-STOP THRILL.
B0008ENHUI|5|Bought as a gift, he loved it. Shipping was fast.
B00E8KLWB4|3|This game is interesting.  I enjoy the hunt. Why not wait until you have a good day.
B00C8S9W0G|5|LOVE!
B00A9T1HUO|4|I enjoyed listening to this CD, but was not as familiar with the songs.  Will need to listen to it a bit more.  Very pleased with the quick delivery.
B00R0RGSLG|5|What will humanity be like in five thousand years?
B004G6009K|5|I absolutely love this movie.  I had just as much fun as my 2 year old watching this movie.  The story flows well, is funny and quirky that adults enjoy it, and the music is fantastic.  Mandy Moor and Zachery Levi do such a great job together.  Love, love, love it!!
B00JB3NUHM|1|Totally Hollywood!
B008XG1X18|1|You get what you pay for
B00005ASGG|4|The first time I saw \\"The Man who shot Liberty Valance\\" was on TCM.I was amazed at the casting of this fine old western and decided to buy it for my library of old movies.  I was not disappointed.  John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, along with Lee Marvin made this far better western than most movies were in it's day!   It is fun to see all of these actors in their prime, doing what they do best!   Thumbs up!!

B00BPDR3F6|5|With lots of historical research, Gilbert has scored a big hit with the lead character, Alma, who is a woman way ahead of her time. Early 1800's, before Darwin, and in the day when women rarely were considered intellectual, much less on the forefront of making a difference in the world, Alma was raised in a secluded botanical environment created by her father's penchant for rare, often medicinal, plants. Her curiosity leads her to amazing feats for a woman in that time. And her love of moss has changed my attitude about that kind of plant forever. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves plants, enjoys historical fiction, or just plain loves a well written story.
B001S49AQW|5|One of my favorite Heyer's. It's fast pace is so fun and interesting. I couldn't put it down.
B000001IPL|5|VERY GOOD CD CONTAINING TWO EVER POPULAR OFFSPRING NUMBERS, COME OUT AND PLAY, AND SELF ESTEEM! (IF YOU LIKE THIS, I SUGGEST YOU BUY IXNAY AS WELL, ITS EVEN BETTER! )
B000002NFM|5|Unlike thousands of identical alternative songs out there, Prodigy's Fat  of the Land delivers 10 hard-hitting reliably good songs. Without a doubt  one of the best cd's of the decade for those of us not relying on Viagra to  have a good time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|a real page Turner. compelling characters and enough twists to.keep you on your toes. highly recommended for anyone who enjoys contemporary fiction
0765325950|5|If this was the First Book in the series, I would have still bought them all.  You could probably even just read this one and be satisfied - but if you've got them, read the whole thing again first - extremely good reads all.
B00C69EP1S|2|Rather mundane and never seems to get to the heart of issues.  Too politically correct.  No excitement in the narrative.  Women Turing to be the new oppressed.
B00AFROVQC|3|Just started and for me this is a new author. It seems at times that I'm reading about characters from novels I read in the past and old story lines, a hiden past, not sure about his liniage.<br />Having said this the characters are likable abs believable, the story line moves at a pace and it has the potential to be a good novel.
0316153826|5|I enjoyed this book very much!  As always,  Harry Bosch doesn't disappoint.  Being one of Michael Connelly's first Harry Bosch books it was fun to go back and get some history as I have read many of his later books.  A good read!
B001TCHDPS|5|Rodriguez: how did I not get to hear this guy back in the day?<br />The record distributors are truly shown here to have been 'asleep at the wheel'.
B0058N2T3K|4|nightmare on elm street r good movies ive enjoyed them. 1, 3 were the best, very dark and good to watch in the dark.
B00403CLK0|5|The information on Amazon makes it appear Katherine's Believe DVD Blu Ray version will not work in North America, but it does. I decided to take a chance and ordered the Blu Ray version, because I loved the standard version so much. To my surprise the Blu Ray version worked perfectly in my Panasonic BDT-220 BR player. Katherine is so gorgeous you need to see her in Blu Ray to experience her full ethereal beauty. Her beauty, amazing voice, intelligence, and genuinely sweet personality makes her one of the most amazing entertainers in the world.
193700788X|1|This book was written differently from the other books and all in all seemed thrown together.  I heard that the author had been planning on this ending since they beginning, but not only was I personally unhappy with the outcome, I felt like it was rushed.  The author seems to has lost her passion for the series and it shows.  I wish the series would have been concluded a couple books ago rather than end this way.
B00004RFCM|5|Sex and the City - The Complete First Season is wonderful.  All the characters are amusing, funny and realistic.  The stories have meanings and good plots.  The Sex and the City - The Complete First Season is a must have for women and men.  On a scale of 1 thru 10, I give Sex and the City - The Complete First Season a 7.  The only thing that I think Sex and the City - The Complete First Season needs to improve on is a multiple ethnics/races of the cast.
B00DMCV7K0|5|I loved this story! It really gives a personal view into what it was like during the times before slavery was abolished. It is also a story of not only slavery but of how women were perceived back in those days as almost like property. I especially enjoyed reading about different locations in Charleston that I have been lucky to visit along with my daughter who lives there.
0062215507|5|Got his for my boyfriend!!!! LOVED it! Such a neat book! It is scrap-book like because there are all sorts of pull out things inside, like maps and pictures and stickers..must have for potter lovers
B004XUMMFE|5|A vastly underrated masterpiece that ended entirely before its time. Firefly has Joss Whedon's attitude and sense of humor and a wonderful mix of adventure and intrigue. The series never takes itself too seriously and provides an interesting storyline with fully developed characters and believable story lines. The only negative about this series is that it was canceled after its first season.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is better than temples run and the character changes each season I will rate this five stars<br />🐇🐇🐇
0756404746|5|I was surfing amazon for a book I could buy in our local store and I found a link for this book. The book is great!! The only downside is that book 2 is still far off. I recommend this book to anyone with an open imagination.
0307951529|4|I'm a long-time reader of Chris Guillebeau's blog, and I've purchased several of his products, including his last book. Because of that, I found most of the material in this book to be just a rehash of things I'd read elsewhere from him.<br /><br />That said, this book is a great introduction on starting a small, bootstrapped business. It doesn't dive too deep into the details, but it's enough to help a business newbie start sketching out some ideas and testing their concepts. I've already recommended it to a couple of people and gave a copy to a friend who's starting up a new venture.<br /><br />While the book seems geared mostly toward new business owners, it also gives loads of case studies that are inspirational even for seasoned entrepreneurs. I recommend it!
B000002I8D|4|Phil Collins shows how true talent can make some things appear effortless. I think he is a very gifted singer.
B009MEEZXI|5|Great woman and wonderful acting by Claire Danes. even the despicable cowboys acted great.
B00ABGEFWC|4|this game is really fun and awesome but sometimes you have to prease something more than once or sometimes it hits the wrong thing
B0097HSS4M|5|I use it all the time. Simple application for simple edits! I recommend this program to any looking for quick edit on simple pictures!
B0076DCT2G|5|because,along with all his boots you know that every book is as good if not better than the last.  GREAT

1400067820|4|Let me start by saying that I am a massive Taleb fan.  His writing influences many aspects of my life.<br /><br />I believe all the positive elements of this book have been covered by other reviewers so no need for me to go over old ground.  The whole concept of hormesis is one I have always thought was vitally important.  He has surrounded this concept with a robust (antifragile?) framework which makes perfect sense.<br /><br />However, I have one small issue which I have found troubling.  It is when he calls ADHD and Depression \\"invented illnesses\\".  I know what he is trying to say - that they are overdiagnosed and many cases are simply someone with a negative bias or a kid with some behavioural issues.<br /><br />As someone with impeccable logic (usually), Taleb appears to have done something strange in this particular chapter.  He has spent the first part of the chapter talking about how Semmelweis was ostracized because although he knew that washing hands reduced mortality, he had no theory as to why, which did not satisfy the 'establishment' of the time.  How is this different from genuine cases of ADHD or Depression?  To use ADHD as an example, all the doctors in this field know is that you can have a pathological behaviour pattern and you give them a particular kind of medication (which work on dopamine & noradrenaline) and the kids function like normal kids.  However, for certain quarters of the medical 'establishment' this is not yet acceptable because of no satisfactory 'theory' of why this should be the case.  Same for depression.  There are some people that, without medication, are completely unable to function or enjoy any quality of life.  Again, there is no satisfactory 'theory' as to why this should be the case.  Monoamine hypothesis? Faulty thinking? Diet?  All we know is that for severe depression, drugs can give certain people their life back.  This is no different than high blood pressure or hypercholesterolemia.  People have a right to qualityof life.<br /><br />I think it is irresponsible and logically incorrect to label a whole illness 'invented' because of the minority of cases at the periphery where drugs are overused.<br /><br />I also think there is a slight variation of the very concept Taleb pushes in the Black Swan at work here.  Taleb does not personally suffer depression or have a child who cannot function without ADHD medication.  As someone who is an acolyte of Popper and the problem of induction, I find Taleb's comments regarding Depression & AHDH bizarre and lacking logical rigor.<br /><br />However, this was the only part of the book I took umbrage with.  On the whole, another excellent Taleb book which I will definitely be re-reading at various times in the future again.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is really fun to play! It is great when you're waiting for class to start or when you're waiting for a shift to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Absolutely fun right now their is competition going on between my daughter, my nephew, and me, HA! Guess who is winning!
B006XB267K|3|I generally love the time slip episodes but this one was the worst. The story plot was a bigger 'meh' and it really had no purpose, unless you think the 30 seconds of \\"future telling\\" was worth the whole episode.  The other time travel episodes seemed to be more poignant to the over arching plot but this was the general \\"hunt bad thing\\" episode. This is the sort of thing you get when you try to pull a time travel plot line one time too many. The conclusion (how Dean got home) seemed very deus ex machina.
B00BAXFDLM|5|This was an excellent novel, particularly coming as it did from a previously unpublished writer.  The writing is a bit rough around the edges at times, but the detailed and ambitious story more than makes up for it.  Ancillary Justice is space opera at its finest, and Leckie has demonstrated that she can weave a complex story in a huge universe.  I'm looking forward to more!
B006LSZECO|5|This book was a great read. I was absorbed in the story. Just a warning if you buy on Kindle - you aren't allowed to share this title.
