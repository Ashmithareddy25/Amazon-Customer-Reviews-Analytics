B00104W8T6|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie Juno and my friend and I left the movie theatre humming all the catchy indie tunes.<br /><br />So I was definitely excited when I saw that they were releasing a soundtrack for the film.  If you like indie pop--especially the type with lots of stories--you'll enjoy the juno soundtrack.  The inclusion of the track where Ellen Page and Michael Cera sing Anyone Else But You at the end of the movie is a nice bonus.

B000002LIM|5.0|Hello everyone. I am an avid collector of film scores, especially rare or out of print promotional items. With over 200 scores in my collection, I know my subject well.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Michael Jackson's. In my opinion, he is the greatest artist of all time. His music makes me want to get up and dance.I really enjoyed the track \\"The girl is mine\\" with Will I Am. I thought it was the best new version of an already fantastic song. I am hoping that the sales of this new CD will encourage Michael to give us more. We love you Michael!!!
B000065V1V|4.0|So David goes retro, setting the clock back to the '70s - \\"Slip Away\\" almost retains the spirit of \\"Life on Mars?\\" - but keeping another foot firmly in 2002, which makes the album seem anachronistic and up-to-date at once. The choices of covers (an uneventful but far from bad version of the Pixies' \\"Cactus\\"; Neil Young's \\"I've Been Waiting for You\\", transformed from a nice love ballad into a roaring, Ziggy Stardust-like rocker with Dave Grohl on not drums, but guitar), and the half old-school, half up-to-date production on this album furthers this theory. \\"Sunday\\" combines both approaches, starting as a cold, emotionless ballad and moving to an aching climax (a la \\"Five Years\\"), while \\"Slow Burn\\" and \\"Afraid\\" have the heavy guitars, pounding pianos, brass, operatic vocals and Orwellian lyrics of Diamond Dogs, but with a distinctively modern sheen in the production. It works out very well for the guy, too, because he hasn't lost any ground whatsoever as a songwriter, spinning out hook after hook after hook with clever lyrics about the ups and downs of getting old. He really blows it on the slow, stoic \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\" and on the \\"spacey\\" \\"I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship\\" - two attempts to carry songs on production alone. But when he matches the production with good songwriting and interesting structure, as on \\"5:15 The Angels Have Come\\" (think that's a Who tribue?), that's something different entirely. He also makes it work on \\"Everybody Says `Hi'\\", because he does very interesting stuff with all of those synthesizers. The record's just a couple missteps away from being a classic (the overblown title track), and I'd definitely call this a late-career milestone - I'd call it a return to form if it weren't for the fact that I haven't heard any other of his recent albums.

B00004U45G|3.0|I'm a huge Led Zeppelin fan and Black Crowes fan and thought that this CD was going to Rock.  I'd say if your are more of a Crowes fan this would be a 5 star, but if you are a true Robert Plant fan...I'd give it a 2.  A let down on most songs except the few that were not Zeppelin.  Just not the same, maybe if the songs were changed to be more their own.  Just didn't live up to what I thought it could be.

B000YMBBH0|5.0|We love the Bourne trilogy.  Unfortunately, we had to purchase it somewhere else.  You see, we weren't smart enough to know that you had to have an HD DVD player in order to view an HD DVD video.  So when ordering, be sure you order videos you will be able to view on your equipment.  That doesn't change the fact we love the Bourne movies and would recommend them to anyone who likes adventure and fast-pace action.  One other thing - I paid about $20 less for the three videos at Blockbuster than I originally paid Amazon.
0066620996|5.0|We live in a world that is better and best - no one really wants to be great anymore.  Just give me 2.5 kids in a 4 bedroom 2 1/2 bath house and 2 cars.  We all settle for mediocrity and it is disgusting.  Money is easier to make now than it has ever been, it just takes some determination to make it.    I love reading about people who have gone that extra step.  The ones to really stuck their neck out to make something happen.  That is refreshing.  This book will satisfy a thirst in you - if you really want to look for exceptional ideas.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Hamlet is my favorite play.  As a teacher I want an accurate, entertaining version to show my students.  This is the best version I have seen, and the only un-cut version I am aware of.  Its all-start cast nails every character.  Students constantly complain that movies of Shakespeare's plays are always \\"dark and boring.\\"  This can not be said of this version.  It uses bright colors and has a modern edge without being \\"modern day.\\"

Here is a group of rather normal people who have mastered the art of making money.  The books fed my appetite for trading knowledge and developed my willpower to trade.    These are a great read - I will, no doubt, probably read these often just to get the mental boost that they offer.  Highly recommended!
006441034X|5.0|Before Hayao Miyazaki made \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" into a feature length animated film in 2006 (2004 if you saw it in Japan), it was a book written by Diana Wynne Jones in 1986. Due to the inherent difficulties of creating an animated film, Miyazaki greatly abridged and adjusted the plot of the novel for his movie. I happened to enjoy both film and novel but after reading the book I realized that the plot is extremely different in the novel--enough that the book and movie become completely different viewing experiences.<br /><br />Anyway, that's all I'm going to say about the movie. On to the discussion of the book:<br /><br />Sophie lives \\"in the land of Ingary, where such things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility exist.\\" In other words, all of the traditional fairy tale stories are real. Not so bad, except that Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three sisters, which everyone knows means Sophie is doomed to failure should she ever set out to seek her fortunes.  Sophie is resigned to her fate--living obscurely, and less than successfully, working in the family hat shop. Except that this is not a traditional fairy tale and events soon intervene to set Sophie on a very unexpected course indeed for an eldest daughter.<br /><br />It all starts in the hat shop after some interesting things begin to happen when Sophie talks to the hats she trims. Interesting enough to attract the attention of the dangerous Witch of the Waste. When her encounter with the Witch of the Waste leaves Sophie cursed in the body of an old woman, she has no choice but to go out and seek her fortune in hopes of breaking the curse (even if she is an eldest daughter).<br /><br />Along the way, Sophie comes upon a mysterious moving castle that has taken up in the hill's of Ingary. The castle belongs to Wizard Howl \\"who was known to amuse himselv by collection young girls and sucking the souls from them. Or some people said he ate their hearts.\\" Either way, he was not anyone Sophie expected to ever meet let alone move in with. Until she does. Adventure ensues as Sophie tries to break the curse and help Howl with his own uniquely magical problems.<br /><br />In terms of fantasy novels, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is one of my favorites. The world Jones creates is fully realized without ever getting boring or limiting the reader's imagination. The tone of her narrative is also spot on. Readers of Jane Austen's novels or the \\"Sorcery and Cecelia\\" series will notice a similar narrative voice. Although this novel is largely timeless, the prose has a charmingly Victorian tone--taking its time to arrive at the action, the better to familiarize readers with the characters involved and show the readers just how fantastic they (and the story) really are.<br /><br />I also adore this story because it is romantic, thrilling, and completely absorbing. Even at 329 pages, the novel is far too short. Happily, Diana Wynne Jones follows up \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" with \\"Castle in the Air\\" (1990) and a brand new book featuring Sophie and Howl (\\"House of Many Ways\\") is due out in May of 2008.ever meet let alone move in with.

B000VJAICK|5.0|To the previous post this film looks great in HD. Not as clear as some other recent titles like Transformers but there were no scratches or blemishes in the print. It's  a fun B horror movie with cheesy special effects and slightly over the top acting. I enjoyed it and glad I baught it!
B000PC0U1W|2.0|A bizarre blending of Zorro, The Phantom of the Opera and 1984 - only this time John Hurt is playing Big Brother - all in the style of the TV cult series of the sixties, The Avengers. Sadly, Natalie Portman is no Mrs Peel! It's mildly diverting but anyone looking for something really deep and meaningful will be wasting his or her time. Not an original idea on show.
1401207928|5.0|A wonderful book that shows the danger of giving any government too much power (for any reason, especially when you are afraid because you feel threatened or in danger ... people seldom make good choices when they are in fear for their life [real or imagined]).   Beyond the important message the book is entertaining and a good read. Written in the 1980's the book is eerily prophetic in its predictions of government surveillance tactics. Keeping in mind that this week the House of Reps just passed a bill that will keep phone companies free of lawsuits for allowing the government to tap phone calls without a warrant it strikes home more than ever.
0452289963|5.0|Anyone who enjoys Tolle's books, realizes that he is sharing the teachings of mindfulness in a new and accessible way.  I highly recommend this book along with FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz and BEING ZEN by Ezra Bayda. A tour de force of new approaches to mindful living.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|One of the best movies of all time and perhaps released at just the right time.  I think it is even better than the graphic novel and that is high praise indeed from me. I also gave the graphic novel 5 stars so it should give some clue as to how good I think this movie is. It pulled at my heart strings, it made my heart beat quicker with action, it had a certain romance about it, and in these strange times of government power grabs it made me stop and think about the world that is being created by our politicians today. Do we really want to trust them with all the newly created powers? Do we really want to surrender our rights and freedoms to them in order to be \\"safe\\"? These things are worth thinking about while you enjoy this wonderful film.
B00000I8BX|5.0|This is without a doubt FF's finest album. Most people consider Demanufacture to be better, but I disagree. The songs on Obsolete seem to have more varity to them, and aren't as repetitive as the ones on Demanufacture. Not one song drags on too long, which is hard to believe since a majority of the songs are over, or near five minutes long. And who can dislike the concept of man VS. machine? A song by song analysis.     Shock: Opens with a bang, and has the 'hard verse, melodic chorus' formula that's become a FF staple. One of my favorite FF songs. Some of you may have even heard this song before on the video game 'Test Drive Off Road 2\\"    Edgecrusher: Is one of FF's most known songs. While catchy, it still retains the heaviness of previous classics. The pre-chorus is great.     Smasher/Devourer: A slower song, by FF standards of course. Has harsh vocals in the verse and chorus, a rarity for FF, but the melodic bridge satisfies those of us who love Burton's more lighter voice.     Securitron (Police State 2000) Is a great, pummling song. Great chrous, great bridge, great song.     Descent: Much more mellow than the previous tracks. A FF staple.     Hi-Tech Hate: Cranks the heavy meter up again. Has an incredible chorus, that I always find getting stuck in my head.     Freedom or Fire: Excellent track! Very heavy, and it has the most harsh vocals on the entire album.     Obsolete: Here's what I'm talking about! The intro is a little slow, but Herrera's drum intro builds up the tension that an explosion is about to occur. Incredibly heavy song that every FF fan should listen to.    Resurrection: The album's most melodic, and most epic song. Nothing but a keyboard and Burton until the rest of the band enters. One of the best chorus' I've ever heard. A masterpiece, no doubt.     Timelessness: This song is all Burton, no Guitar, Bass, or Drums whatsoever. He lays out the most beautiful, and impressive vocal performance of his career. Though it sounds beautiful, the songis very depressing.     Cars: Ahh, the incredible cover of the song by Gary Numan, who actually appears in the song. One of the best covers I've ever heard, and it's a great way to end this stellar album.     Buy this album, it's probably the best way to introduce yourself to the greatest underground band ever, Fear Factory.
B00102FELM|5.0|There is a reason why the scorpions remain at the apex of rock music. From their inception in the 60's to present day they have continued to evolve and grow and consistantly put on concerts that are pure energy and fun.   Yes they are older now and their original drummer and bassist are no longer with them but it hasn't stopped them from remaining the consumate professionals that they are. It hasn't stopped them from bringing forth great music and live shows that everyone can enjoy. Younger musicians coming up in the ranks should sit up and pay attention as these german rockers long ago mastered the secret of longevity in a dog eat dog profession.   I've had the great pleasure of seeing the scorpions play live on several occasions and 13 years ago I also had the great fortune to spend an entire day with these kind gentleman. They love to share their music and they love and respect their fans.   If your looking for good music and non-stop energy then this is the dvd for you.
0307388840|5.0|Briony Tallis is the focus of the first part of the book.  She is a budding writer and the author focuses on the nuances, the pain, the pleasure of writing through the eyes of a thirteen year old.  She witnesses several \\"scenes\\" between her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie.  She does not understand the adult scenes she witnesses and accuses Robbie of a terrible crime.  There is a second half, involving Robbie during WW2 and Cecilia who by then is Robbie's lover.  The accusation that Briony makes against Robbie, and which later she recognizes as her mistake, causes decisions in her life and others where she tries to rectify the mistake she made as a young girl.  There is what you would call a third part of the book that again focuses on Briony and writing.  I found the first part interesting through Briony's eyes and that of her family and was very satisfied how the author moved into the second and third parts where there was still an intellectual movement of the story but with more action.  I definitely recommend this book.  Although I haven't seen the movie I have good feelings about it.  I hope that it is as satisfying as the novel.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|This is an AWESOME album. I've always liked a Simple Plan, but they really mature on this album in a BIG BIG way. If you're looking 4 more WHINING vocals from the lead singer you can forget it. He has finally reached P*berty and no longer sounds like Eminem. The lyrics to me just seem so much more mature and the group has collaborated so well with each other to create such an amazing piece of ART. I've noticed the roaster contains some big name producers and that is probably what everyone is experiencing on the shift in sound. But it's a very small semi change. The change actually seems like it's for the better. \\"I Can Wait Forever\\" has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album. It's a stand out track and is also an amazing ROCK BALLAD. Almost every song on this album is a 5 star track and the leads singer's voice really sounds so soothing and beautiful this time around. The hooks to the CHORUS lines are beyond ADDICTIVE. Great to see this band mature and I'm looking forward to see where this group lands next. Don't pass on this album because it's a total GEM.
B000V9G9VE|1.0|I think it is unconscionable that every one in the world is allowed to download this album in lossless \\"flac\\" format but, due to some kind of Amazon licensing deal, those of us in the US are only allowed to download it in the inferior MP3 format.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|i've probably seen titanic at least 10 times between in the original release at the theater and also at home.  every time it holds up to its reviews.  this is one of my top 10 movies ever.  5 stars.  the dvd includes extras such as still photos and also other unique bonus features.
B00005JPTI|3.0|I am Legend' s point of departure remits us immediately to \\"Planet of the apes\\" , \\"28 days later\\"  with a devastating Manhattan (the most cosmopolite city in the world) and a warrior of the road, the only survivor in many miles away, (whose only friend is his almost human pet Sam, whose expressiveness equals it with the sympathetic dog in \\"As good as it gets\\")<br /><br />The film reconstructs the previous moments to the global catastrophe, the origin of the messy and chaos that led this apocalyptic ambiance.<br /><br />But since the middle of the story, one feels the plot simply weakens itself more and more; common places, edition problems and sudden alterations of a well planned script simply collapsed with a predictable final and a lack of that crucial dramatic punch.<br /><br />A fabulous idea that stranded in the middle of the river. Perhaps, in hands of veterans directors of this genre (David Cronenberg or John Carpenter) , the overcome would have been by far, quite succesful
B000MRAAJW|5.0|i can't say anything more than what other people's reviews on planet earth.  this is a must buy.  one thing that differs from the original show broadcast on discovery channel:  sigorney weaver does not narrate this dvd.  instead it's sir richard attenboro who lends a very pleasant english accent.  fantastic set.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|The Best of the Johnny Cash Show is a fascinating look at the history of American popular music.  Louis Armstrong plays \\"Blue Yodel #9,\\" just as he did on Jimmie Rodgers' 1930 recording.  James Taylor makes his network television debut on the show.  June Carter made Linda Ronstadt put on bloomers before she was allowed to sit onstage next to Johnny in her short skirt.  Mother Maybelle Carter, Pete Seegar, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, George Jones--they're all there, and more.  Master picker Norman Blake was a guitarist in the house band, as was the incredible Carl Perkins.  Perkins' performance of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" is incredible, and \\"Matchbox\\" with Perkins, Clapton, and Cash recalls the glory days of Sun Studios in Memphis.<br /><br />If you are a music lover, you will not be disappointed by this DVD set.  There is something for everyone.
1600240526|3.0|A very good read.... David Baldacci upholds his high standards with his latest book, Stone Cold.   The pace is fast and it is well written and eminently readable.....he has created great characters - you can meet them in Camel Club and The Collectors, Stone Cold comes after these two.   One can always count on a great book from Baldacci...!

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I have to say that I was not a fan of this style of music prior to seeing the movie. The movie was perfect, and the soundtrack is also. There are a wide variety of songs including solos, duets, and a song with a larger ensemble. Some songs are melancholy and haunting and others more hopeful. These melodies will not leave you once you hear it! All in all, it is a very well-rounded album, and one of the best soundtracks ever.

B000XUOIQ4|4.0|While The Aristocats is definitely not even probably a top 10 favorite Disney animated film of mine, it IS one that's brought me a lot of enjoyment. Enough so that I was willing to pay the $[...] and buy this new DVD edition, even though I had the previous Gold Classic Collection edition.    You don't even need to watch both - just look at their lists of bonus material offerings - to see that this new DVD blows the previous one away, although there is a reason some may disagree. More on that later. While the previous one had a very easy trivia game and a 1980's reissue trailer, which is sadly not found on the new disc, this one does include some nice, if often fluffy, bonus material, which includes set-top and DVD-ROM versions of a Virtual Kitten game, deleted song, a look at the music, a nice photo gallery, and an excerpt from The Wonderful World Of Disney titled The Great Cat Family. The final bonus, which was never really mentioned in any press-release and definitely not on the package, is a delightful Disney animated short titled Bath Day, which starred Figaro the kitten from Pinocchio.    The new digital transfer blows the previous one out of the water in nearly every way. Much of the softness is gone, the color is superior, and it's not as fuzzy and grainy as it was previously. It's also presented for the first time ever on video in widescreen, although this is a point of contention for some. Most Disney animated films from the 1960's and 1970's were designed with both widescreen theater screens and square TV sets in mind, and therefore were animated in the 1.33:1 Academy ratio but designed so that you didn't lose much character information when the film was matted for widescreen theatrical release. In the case of the new rash of reissues of these movies in cropped widescreen, I don't see an issue with it, as they had intended either presentation. And unlike the cropped widescreen presentation on [[ASIN:B000OLGCI4 The Jungle Book]], which seemed a bit crampedmore often than I'd have liked, this one, as well as the new [[ASIN:B000ICM5T4 Robin Hood: Most Wanted Edition]], looks more comfortable in the cropped aspect ratio. However, if you have the Gold Classic Collection release, I still suggest you own this new one and marvel at the new presentation, while keeping the previous release so that you can also have the full image available.    Despite the obvious upgrade, this DVD is another sad example of Disney's newfound laziness with their DVDs, much of which has to do with Blu-Ray, but that's another rant for another time. Instead of making a 2-Disc set, especially as this was first advertised as one back in 2006, they did one of their typical 1-disc \\"not THAT much of an upgrade\\" reissues of their Gold Classic Collection editions for this release, without retaining anything from the previous release. Disney could have easily filled up a 2-Disc set with one disc for the family audience, which contained the original 1.33:1 version of the film and all the kid-friendly features, while they include another disc for the enthusiast audience with the widescreen version and more fan-oriented bonus materials, like a making-of featurette, even if it's just some TV crap or a 15-minute long piece they threw together. Plus some TRAILERS. The sad fact is, as far as I know, it's been 2005 since Disney last released a non-Platinum and non-Pirates 2-Disc DVD, especially for their classic films, and it'd honestly be nice if Disney would put some of the same energy they had making their DVD releases back in the early 2000's into the DVDs they make today. As a fan, I'm tired of Disney catering almost exclusively to the under-12 market and not enough to the adult fans like myself. Disney animated films may have a sizeable pre-teen audience, but they also have a sizeable adult audience who also wants to enjoy the DVD experience.    Despite my rant above, I'm still happy to own this new Aristocats DVD. With improved picture quality and a handful of decent bonus materials, it's worth a look. Four stars.

This is a great book for children learning to read independently; the illustrations are grand and the words are relatively simple. The book also teaches, in a fun way, some important words for child to increase their vocabulary at the same time. Great!<br /><br />The book has a page near the very beginning on which the child can write their name to personalize this and draw them into the lessons of this book. Just don't tell them they're going to be learning anything--if they think this is all a game they'll gobble up the information faster than anything!<br /><br />The short story introduces a character named Mr. Brown who can go \\"moo\\" just like a cow can. We get a picture of a cow and the sound put together with the picture is very educational. The child is also prompted to make the sound \\"moo\\" themselves. This way they learn about a cow interactively in a creative, fun way that they're sure to love.<br /><br />The book then goes on to use pictures of Mr. Brown and various other creatures so that the child can see these creatures and learn the sounds that each one makes. The child, for example, is asked to make the sound of a bee on a page where Mr. Brown is making the sound \\"buzz;\\" and the child is also encouraged to make the sounds of a cork opening up (pop) and horse feet sounds (klopp klopp). Every few pages there is a \\"refresher page\\" that recaps the lessons of the last several pages so that the child can informally review what they've just learned.<br /><br />The hardcover is strong enough to resist any accidental damage your young child may try to do to it; and the quality of the paper is excellent.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent book for introducing children to animals and wildlife. They see the pictures and make the sounds of each creature as they see Mr. Brown (the informal leader) do the same. I highly recommend this book for children just learning to read who also need to be introduced to animals and wildlife.read who also need to be introduced to animals and wildlife.
B001041JLE|5.0|Well... THRILLER came out in 1983 and if you wanna know what's the importance of this album, just think about this: not only it summed up the best things about American popular music so far but it also revolutionized the way pop music was marketed and regarded. Perhaps, in the History of American music, there are only two phases: before THRILLER and after THRILLER.<br /><br />If we try to break down the album, we can see each song as the outstanding corollary of certain styles and influences... R&B, Motown, TSOP, Blues, Disco, Gospel, Electro and anything else you can think of. It's all there. And that is the proof that both Michael and his producer Quincy Jones were, at that time, a match made in heaven.<br /><br />This is certainly an album to be studied.<br /><br />This 25th Anniversary Edition puts together a nice package: first comes the CD with all the original tracks plus some new remixes and homages(made by Kanye West, Fergie and Will.I.Am) and a new unreleased track FOR ALL TIME.<br /><br />Now... honestly... I found all this new material completely delectable. I really prefer the previous THRILLER SPECIAL EDITION which contains other unreleased tracks AND a beautiful demo of BILLIE JEAN that is gorgeous. That edition of THRILLER is, in my opinion, superior to this one. It is richer... while this one focuses on the \\"homage\\" side.<br /><br />BUT... this edition comes with a DVD that cannot be missed. Not only it brings you the THRILLER video - without a doubt, the video that defined what a music video is today (before THRILLER, music videos were something else...) but it also comes loaded with new stuff (like the unreleased song FOR ALL TIME) and the great MOTOWN 25 TV special.<br /><br />So, in a word, unmissable.<br /><br />And if you are willing to spend more money, this is a DELUXE CASEBOOK EDITION that comes in a hardbound 48-page book full of rare photos, lyrics and more.<br /><br />A little more expensive, but twice unmissable.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have never written a review for Amazon before, but this movie deserves one. There's not really a lot I can say about the movie that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to add my opinion on the plus side. I grew up in the 60's and 70's loving the Beatles. What this movie, and the soundtrack album, does is to pay homage to the songs, rather than try to duplicate them (which would have been silly). Each of the original Beatles' versions of the songs is perfect. Each of the new versions is very different from the original, but is also perfect. That the filmmakers managed to make each song an integral part of the story is magnificent. The film is funny, touching, inspiring, and just great fun. I'm totally nonplussed at some of the (admittedly few) negative reviews here. I don't really know what souls are supposed to be, but it's pretty clear that, in the ordinary use of the term, anyone who doesn't enjoy this film doesn't have one.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|First thing I thought of when I popped in this CD is how much the organ sound on the opening tracks, \\"Mansard Roof\\" reminded me of Korla Pandit. Remember him? The faux Indian organist who played on TV in the 1950's? TOO COOL! Love this CD.
1594489505|5.0|An excellent read, as good as The Kite Runner. I read both of these one right after the other, they both kept me in suspense of what was going to happen next. They may be fiction, but you have to ask the question, do some of the things that happened in these books really happen to these people, I wouldn't be surprised. To be honest, I couldn't put the book down, read The Kite Runner in one day and took me two to read A Thousand Splendid Suns, I usually won't read a book it has to keep my interest up, Khaled Hosseini has accomplished this. I will read anything else he writes.
B00005U8EM|5.0|a middle aged man's coming of age story.  watching this movie with adult eyes, i was struck by the detailed structure.  bill is already repeating a groundhog's day his whole life, an empty existence.  at first, that's how interprets and exploits his new existence, through empty gluttony.  then he takes the challenge of seducing andie, but it's not love.  then he goes through depression and torments, negating his existence thru suicide attempts.  finally, he accepts his fate, and looks to enrich himself thru literature, music, and art, while at the same time reaching out to others and becoming fully human. thru this process, he naturally wins the heart of andie, as he becomes a man, one willing to give and not only receive.    the gift is that this story is told with so much humor, that one doesn't realize the structured details at first.  although there are some rough spots, it is highly crafted and tells an intricate story upon inspection and reflection.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This year I was not expecting to find another lovely movie like Pride and Prejudice (2005) but it has appeared! I ordered this title from Amazon not knowing the plot or expecting anything other than to enjoy a Jane Austen classic and boy was it a romance! Fantastic casting!  Such a tremendous achievement for the actors and the BBC!
0226264211|4.0|I picked up this book as a beginning of an attempt to self-educate myself on the topic of economics.  Maybe it is not the best place to start for a novice, but I did thoroughly enjoy the book.  Dr. Friedman makes a compelling case for capitalism, which has been under so much assault by academia, popular culture and the media.  Friedman explains why capitalism works, as opposed to government intervention in the economy, in a compelling and concise book.  At times, some of the concepts went over my head, but for the most part this was attainable for the beginner.  I strongly recommend this book and intend to take a shot at more of Friedman's books.
0143038419|1.0|(If I could have, I would have used no stars but the system wouldn't let me.)  I bought this book for entertaining reading but was terribly disappointed.  Some of it is interesting but the author ruins much of it with her political opinions that seem to pop up out of nowhere and the reader is left wondering, where the hell did that come from?  I was also numbed by the author's flippant use of the F word.  It definitely paints a very different picture of the author herself and I fail to understand why this book has gotten so much publicity.  I would not recommend this book, at least don't buy it.  If you must read it, borrow it so you can return it.

B0010ZR160|4.0|Ben Affleck, the director, finally proved his acting chops in \\"Hollywoodland\\", and has now made his mark as a director.<br /><br />This movie -- based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote \\"Mystic River\\", which was turned into an Oscar movie by Clint Eastwood -- explores similar ground covered by its predecessor, crime in the lower economic reaches of Boston, and does so in bravura style.<br /><br />Casey Affleck turns in a fine performance as the conflicted PI working on a kidnap case, as do all the other actors. As always, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris prove their reputations as being well-earned.<br /><br />This is a great cast in a wonderful movie, and I have to wonder why it didn't do better at the box office. Ben Affleck's tabloid reputation? The weird title?<br /><br />Whatever the reason, I'm glad I watched this, and can strongly recommend it.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is not just another superhero movie. This is a film that shows the development of real masculinity - showing the difference between the boy and the man. The ability to rise up from being beaten down, to become someone stronger once you have been unmade - an incredible film.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Sometimes you may find yourself looking for versions of old songs with some type of renewed style but you will find regular voices with just modern arrangements and a few new instruments. But, this is a great-outstanding soundtrack not only due to the original compositions (from The Beatles) but to the excellent voices and the transparency of them with no many additives beyond the passion in the performance. The version of \\"I want to hold your hand\\" is so full of feelings as well as the gospell style of \\"Let it be\\". If you really want to hear fresh voices, fresh versions, old songs in an, someway, alternative style... you will enjoy this double CD.
B000YAFJYS|4.0|I want to be totally fair in my review of \\"Persepolis.\\" Though I really liked the story, the stark visual animation was not to my liking.The film is done in simple drawn black and white line,which may very much be an artistic decision to show the strict \\"black and white \\" regime policies of Iran;but the film is not visually engaging for a person such as I who enjoy color.Other than that, the message of this film is tremendously compelling.\\"Persepolis\\" will be a matter of perception for some. as it was for me.There is no faulting it's content.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Celine Dion captures all the besutiful sentiments of being a mother in this amazing album.  Each time I listen to it with my daughter, a different song/verse grabs my heart.  This is a CD worth having a second copy of just in case the first wears out.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Man oh man was this album a surprise! I was expecting something along the lines of super-futuristic electronica but the boys plumeted back to earth to once again become re-aquainted with their intruments. There is a definite dreamy quality about this album that stays with you after repeated listens. Now, im not going to be cliche and compare this album to 'OK Computer' or 'Kid A' or anything else in their catalog for that matter since, 'In Rainbows' is a beast in its own right and deserves recognition for being a stand out album, not a comparison to older works.<br /><br />The album packaging is quite nice being that its made of a kind of lamenated paper but, as you can see in the video above, they include a do-it-youself kit where you can customize your album cover with the stickers included. Now on to the music.<br /><br />The album starts off with '15 step' which is kinda dancey and upbeat while still retaining a dark feel, i especially love the synth toward the end of the song. It instantly gave me a feeling of nostalgia, which is a quality i adore in good music. I find no need to give a track by track review since im sure many people covered that already but, i will say that the overall mood of 'In rainbows' goes from happy to sad to introspective and everything in between.<br /><br />For all of you who put 'OK Computer' on a pedestal and were hoping radiohead would make a fresh sounding album with actual intrumentation, this album is for you. Its a beautiful composition from an ever changing band who i continue to admire.<br /><br />'In Rainbows' will only reveal more with every listen. A definite must buy!<br /><br />I also recommend checking out:<br /><br />Tool '10,000 Days'<br /><br />The mars volta 'The bedlam in goliath'<br /><br />Meshuggah 'ObZen'<br /><br />Neurosis 'Times of grace'<br /><br />King crimson 'The construKction of light'<br /><br />Porcupine tree 'Fear of a blank planet'<br /><br />Opeth 'My arms, your hearse'

B000VALY54|4.0|If you've never seen a Robert Downey Jr. movie in your life, this is the film to pick up and watch. Now. Without fail. If what you really know about Robert is what you've read in the press about his addictions, then you need to educate yourself. I needed to be educated. I was. Here I am, four star review.<br /><br />The film starts off with a thief, Harry, running from the police, and landing himself in an audition. He cries, he gets the role. Bang. (Or bang bang, if you will.) He gets invited to a random party, meets a gay private investigator, played brilliantly by Val Kilmer, and meets the girl of his dreams from a few years ago. Dead bodies appear, and they must find the clues, and solve the murders before it's them up next.<br /><br />But Harry is also narrating the movie. He can pause the film and fill you in on the background, remind you about something that happened previously in the film, or hilariously rewind the movie. (So funny.)<br /><br />The one liners in this movie are hilarious. Basically every line that comes from Robert & Val's lips are nearly always funny. This film has everything else a murder mystery lacks - a sense of humour. And Robert of course. There's lots of trademarks in this - death, trashy clubs, sex, the beautiful blonde, wrapped up corpses, crazy clues, and lots and lots of twists.<br /><br />Every male watching this as probably aspired to be someone as cool as Harry at some point in their life. He's cool, he's a 'good' criminal, and he makes the audience root for him. Paired up against Perry, the gay PI, every scene will raise a smile (if not something else!), and the two actors have perfect chemistry together, and they probably had a laugh off screen as well as on.<br /><br />I won't spoil the movie any more for anyone who hasn't seen it, but for god's sake pick it up! It's definitely one I'll be looking out for, cheap, as the one liners are quick and witty, and the actors are amazing in it. Also, it'll be good if I can figure out (and remember) the twists and turns before they come this time. But pick it up. Robert is actually an actor, not just press fodder.ore they come this time. But pick it up. Robert is actually an actor, not just press fodder.

B00102FELM|4.0|I got mine from Amazon yesterday and even though Amazon listed it as NTSC, it was PAL.  It had a sticker that said \\"import\\" and said it was from Thailand on the back.  I was wondering if there is an NTSC version available.  If not, I will hold on to this even though it doesn't work with my television.  If anyone got the NTSC version, I would like to know where I could get it.
0061544493|5.0|I picked this up expecting a stuck-up book that would ridicule American styles and recommend designer collections that I could never afford (why did I buy it? I've always loved Posh Spice...).  But I was so pleasantly surprised to find that this book is an incredibly practical guide to dressing well and embracing your own personal style.  Victoria recommends high-end designers, but also recommends affordable vintage stores and cheaper trendy stores like TopShop and H&M.  The thing that surprised me most about this book was how good it made me feel about myself; like any woman, I certainly have my fair share of \\"fat days,\\" but this book emphasizes that no body can pull off EVERY look (she even shares a few trends that don't suit her flawless body!), and that you have to find what works for you and what makes you feel beautiful.  I loved this book, especially the lists at the end of every chapter that summarize the best place to shop for certain items.  Highly recommended!
B0000542D2|5.0|This is a great classic Beatles video - it really gives you an idea of how crazy the Beatles mania was.
0525950079|4.0|Read Pillars of the Earth and this title back to back. As a student who studied English history in public school in the UK and later in US university, the author brought to life the happenings during this period of English history. Ficitional as it was, it really captured my attention and brought many inferences to the historical facts of that period. I highly recomend both books but not at one sitting. Great writing from the author, wish he will have more coming in the future along this story-line.
B000002UAX|4.0|This is a classic Beatles album - it gives the listener a very diverse view of their styles and capabilities.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|I am not rating the show since I've only seen parts of some episodes.  But I suspect the 4-star average given this product by all reviewers is strongly based on the show content, not the product itself.    My 3-star rating (generous) is solely based on the product (lack of) quality.  After two tries, I asked Amazon for a refund.    Many of the discs were heavily scratched, dented, or had a film on them.  Be sure to examine each disc in good light before your return period is up.      The picture quality (4:3 format by the way) is marginal...how did they recorded this stuff anyway?  It does improve somewhat in the latter seasons.  Also note you can't play the whole season automatically; you must go back to a menu to start each episode.  This will be inconvenient for those of you who want to continually play this series in the \\"background\\" instead of music or radio, as my daughter does with Friends.    The plastic case was fine in both sets but the case is very hard and sharp.  We liked the velvety texture of the book but the degree of \\"velvetiness\\" varied between the two sets.    The discs fit into slots cut into the paper pages and sorted by season.  These pages will most likely tear with repeated use.  You can't replace a torn page without taking the whole book apart; it has a spiral binder...not 3-ringed.    Given the amount of discounting on this box set and the individual seasons at times, HBO must be making a ton of money on the series.  Watch for sales...I've seen the boxed set available for under $100 and the individual seasons for under $10 each (but a store might not have all the seasons at one time).  At those prices, HBO will NOT be improving the quality of this almost \\"disposible\\" DVD series.
0375714669|5.0|Persepolis II takes us from 1984 to 1994 in the continuing story of Marjane Satrapi's life. As this episode begins, she is 15, alone in Vienna at the Catholic boarding school to which here parents sent her to escape war and religious conflict in Iran. Marjane makes her way through the foreign landscape, learns the language, makes friends and eventually loses her way, tumbling into a world of drugs and homelessness. Dispirited, she returns to Iran and to her parents, only to be oppressed by the rigid fundamentalism that gripped the country during this period. Nevertheless, she studies art, falls in love and marries, and then faces the loss of her marriage.<br /><br />Satrapi's great skill is in depicting herself with utter honesty. Whether it be her volatile and rebellious nature, the \\"beauty mark\\" on the side of her nose or her experimentation with drugs and sex, she comes completely clean about how she was and how she got there. Her artwork -- stark black-and-white graphic images -- seems rudimentary at first, but quickly establishes its visual appeal and ability to communicate. This book is less political than the original Persepolis, with Satrapi wrestling more with inner demons than with those in the world at large. Her depiction of the excesses of the mullahs -- beatings, executions, petty harassment -- is balanced with her admission that some mullahs were moderate, and even kind.<br /><br />Persepolis II, unlike some sequels, is as interesting and vital is the first volume. By the end, I was excited about the possibility of a Persepolis III. You go, Marjane!
B000JJSRNY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this live recording of the Berlin Concert. The selected works by the greats Verdi, Puccini, Bernstein and Lehar just to name a few appeal to audiences of all ages and musical tastes.  Plácido Domingo, great as always is joined by soprano Anna Netrebko and tenor Rolando Villazón, two of the most magnificent voices in Opera today.  There is romance, excitement and the kind of superb singing that keeps you wanting more!
B000QFCD5O|1.0|I am a huge fan of John Wetton, Asia, King Crimson, Yes and ELP. This, however, was a major letdown for me. It just makes me long for 1982-83 when they worked well together.     The Bad: Where do I begin??? As a guitarist, I have to say that Steve Howe is one of the sloppiest, most overrated guitarists in the world now. He bears comparison to Jimmy Page, who can't even seem to stumble through 'Stairway' anymore without killing it (something most ten-year-olds I've taught have no problem with). Should these guys have stayed on drugs?! Howe falls flat on his face through several of the solos, and if it were me, I'd have never let this be released to the public! Yeah, he plays several different stringed instruments, but none of them with the wow and impact of his Yes days. Steve, what gives?! Arthritis? I'd accept that as a valid excuse...if it were the case.    Aside from that, most songs plod along much slower than originally recorded. That is purely and simply annoying. If that's not enough, either Wetton or Palmer are continually jerking the beat somewhere it doesn't want to be or missing a cue. Is it Palmer that keeps things from moving at pace, or did they plan on playing everything slower so that they could all still keep up?    Add to all this not a very good production mix. Did the band even listen to this before it was released? Someone should be fired.    People who love Asia regardless of quality will probably enjoy having Wetton back (I have my fingers crossed for the new studio album), but it's a sad thing when a cover band could blow these guys away at their own material. Seriously, this makes me embarassed for the band! Hopefully they are still good studio artists on the new album, \\"Phoenix.\\" As for live musicians...I hope and pray this isn't exemplary of their efforts.    The Good: Wetton's vocals are still top-notch. He can still hit the notes, but that's a small consolation when the rest is so god-awful.    A waste of my money. Disappointing in mostevery way.
B000XA5K48|1.0|Have you ever seen a movie that was so bad that you had to tell everybody about it just so they could feel your pain?  Well that's what I'm doing now because this is one of those movies.  This movie (as most do) caught my eye with it's preview.  Good action ala John Woo style.  I love action movies as much as any other guy.  Back in the 80's I remember a ton by: Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Norris & Seagal.  They were \\"over the top\\" and at times \\"unrealistic\\" but in the end they were still entertaining and a good time.  Take the unrealistic nature of any of those movies and multiply it by 10.  Many scenes in \\"Shoot em' Up\\" are so unrealistic you will be on the floor laughing it's so bad.  Clive Owen's a great actor but he doesn't have a prayer in saving this bomb.  One scene Clive takes out literally about 50 men that enter a room like an assembly line.  Which if it stopped their would be fine.  But no, he does it while still engaging the female lead in the bedroom?  And if that's not enough she still remains excited during the process!  Or a scene where Owen shoots at a merry-go-round multiple times to get it to spin so a sniper can't get a bead on the baby he just placed their?  Or many scenes where Owen is running, rolling, flipping and smashing through windows which is fine.  But Owen does it while holding a baby like a football.  And of course the baby is always fine afterwards.  Who wrote this movie a 15 year old boy?!  Another area where this movie falls flat is character development.  It's total action from beginning to end.  Which may sound good but you really don't get a chance to know the characters.  Which after a while you can basically care less about them or what happens.  Save an hour and a half of your life and skip this one.  Then again if you want to see how bad something can be check it out?
B000K4WLXA|3.0|This film is undoubtedly one of the best animated films in history.  However, AMAZON  When I received my item with my four books, I found that the shrinkwrap around the whole 5 items was too tight, and created unsightly white wear marks on the edges of this beautiful collection. It made the set look very used. The cover is BLACK, not that crimsonish red color (just for those obsessed with appearances).  TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I think this set is overpriced. The DVD's themselves are the SAME as the two-disk special edition (which, btw, is just over 10 dollars). You get 10 pictures that are the size of the box (which you can easily download online...) and has 2 very thin books (one is the script, and the other is the novel). Each book is printed on very glossy, high-end paper, but they are only 1/4\\" in thickness. Overall, the 10 pieces of artwork + script + novel = 17 dollars. I think that is NOT such a great deal CONSIDERING AMAZON DAMAGED THE PRETTY BOX IT ALL CAME IN.  Also, if you live in cold weather, be sure to take the set in right away. The delivery people left mine out 4 hours before I went to get it (it was  around 10 degrees out there... snow was fresh on the ground).  Overall, the film is EXCELLENT (just read the other reviews), but the packaging done by Amazon was horrendous. I've ordered from Amazon 50 some times and this is the first time that I have EVER been so disappointed. I cannot return it now because the shrinkwrap around the box is gone. Just be careful if you are ordering, and consider buying the 2-disk edition if you're tight on money. This isn't a VERY special edition.
B0000DFZZC|5.0|With a wonderful cast, a meticulous script and an eternal story of battling against great odds, Seabiscuit is about as perfect as a movie can get.<br /><br />Writer-director Gary Ross allows this inspirational to develop on and off the track, the a real gem is the racing sequences, which place the viewer in the saddle of this oftentimes very rugged & brutal sport. The final race scene - as Seabiscuit takes aim for one more glorious victory - is worth the price of this two-CD set.<br /><br />Of particular interest in the additional material is the complete footage of the match-race between The Biscuit and War Admiral.<br /><br />This is an outstanding set which provides additional insight into the development of the film and why The Biscuit captured the hearts of a nation so many years ago and continues to captivate fans in the 21st Century.

B000PTYP5C|1.0|I do not have the right to preach what a band should or should not do, but this album makes absolutely no sense. It is completely devoid of creativity and lacks any sign of the life and joy you find in their previous albums, even Falling Into Infinity (which is considered the weakest one). I have yet to resist releasing the tears from my eyes each time I listen to the beautiful, the absolutely gorgeous album known as Scenes from a Memory. When I listen to this, I simply cannot comprehend what is going on, thinking to myself: \\"Why are they trying to sound like Metallica? ? What happened to good old melody and compassion?\\"     I think Dream Theater could do a heck of a lot better than this, even if it is so extremely difficult to come even close to comparing to their masterpiece album. This is definitely chaotic, but to the extent that it's completely nonsensical. Every time I try to listen to it, I simply cannot get into it which saddens me to say that I will never listen to it again and that is a very difficult decision to make.     This is a Fatal Tragedy for me, Dream Theater.
0805079831|5.0|Shocking analysis of the depredations of unbridled capitalism and feckless government. Every citizen should read this book to learn of the immorality of multinational corporations and stooge politicians. The book details murder, torture and war leading to robbery of countries in Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.
B000059H98|5.0|I lived in England when this movie came out and I had read all of the comic books that were printed about this movie's title character, which made it even funnier when I watched the movie itself.  A lot of the stuff in this movie seems a little disconjointed, but in and of itself, this movie is fun to watch.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time, as a matter of fact.  One of my favorite parts of the movie is right at the beginning and I say it to my husband  --  it's the \\"You've been stealing water\\" part of the movie  --  that is a signal for my hubby to get ready for some postive attention from me.  I reccommend this movie for people who are of an open minded nature, because as I have noticed from some of the other people's reviews, some of their grammar is lack luster and they apparently didn't get any of the jokes or anything about this movie at all.  I HIGHLY reccomend getting this movie to watch as a fun \\"Girl flick\\" with a guy, because of the action  --  you can count on your guy friends being interested in this movie for the action sequences.
0131103628|5.0|This little book is still a standard reference after all these years.  Having gone from programming in C to C++, Ada, Java, and a handful of others, I still find myself referring back to this little reference for a key concept that is as true today as then.  More than a tutorial on the C language, this is a compact desk reference to computer science with real examples of elegant code from a real operating system.  Leave it to masters of efficiency in software design to come up with a marked efficiency in textbook design as well.  Never have so few packed so much into so little space.  The language has changed, the underlying principles of software design have not.
0143038583|4.0|Though the book was a bit slow going in the beginning, I was intrigued by the rest of the book.  I realize that we need to know more about where our food is coming from and how it is raised. I'm looking forward to the author's latest book.
B0013F1D02|4.0|Not since The Princess Bride have I seen a fantasy love story done as well as it is done here. It has everything Claire Danes, the evolution of a character from not knowing what love is to knowing truly what it means, humor, chivalry and a spectacular cast.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I've got to agree that this set is a gem.  I got it after catching Kenny play a show and hear him talk a little bit about it, figured it would be cool to hear Kenny play w/ these greats (they all are, even if you don't know their names--I didn't).    I expected Kenny to lead, but the album and DVD are really about the other artists--he plays behind and under them most of the time, a real homage to them.      Watching the DVD the first time had me totally sucked in, and really depressed me at the end when they list the death dates of many of the featured artists...  makes me really appreciate that Kenny and the band did this, without it I probably never would have heard of most of the featured artists.
B000CFLFX4|3.0|My wife does home and office cleaning, we use mainly Oreck products, including the 8 pound XL vacuums and one of the XL21 9 pound vacuums, along with the Oreck carpet steemer, handheld vacs, and floor polisher. This little battery operated unit WILL get into the little nooks and crannys that just can't be reached with the bigger units. Would be nice if this unit was built a little heavier, she has a tendency to snap the handle in two vacuuming under stuff. I now have enough of these to keep two of them running at all times, the key to the batteries is to NOT overcharge them. If we just owned one, we would probably give it a 1 or 2 star instead of the 3 star. Would give it a 4 on how it works for where you just can't get with full size or even portable vacs.

However, the American dead number between 38,000 - 50,000, MIAs are 8,000+. This was a colossal mistake perpetrated by Mr. Acheson, General MacArthur, and, unfortunately, President Truman who should have named this United Nations undertaking \\"The Korean War.\\"  General MacArthur is, in the opinion of many army veterans and  retired career army veterans, and this reviewer, a man who was much in love with himself, his ego, his status, and his self-recognized genius.

B0010VD7EO|5.0|so i first heard about MGMT at an of montreal concert, they opened up for them, and everybody seemed to absolutely LOVE them, and what is there not to love. their album is packed with bits and pieces of eccentric lullaby's from electro pop to new modern acoustic sounds. its an amazing album that trances you in every bit of every song. you have electric feel which can be danced along to all night long, and then the album finishes with a soothing yet depressing song of future reflections. i give them brownies for making such an amazing dedut album. it is marvelous.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|MAn I can't believe the treatment this good movie is getting.  It's way better than that over the top Rodriguez movie, Planet terror.  People complain about the women being too ordinary to me that's what adds realness to the movie most of us lead pretty ordinary lives and then boom the movie puts these four girls in a pretty extrodinary situation.  This movie is probably not Tarantino's best but it's sure btter than 90% of the Schlock hollywood's been putting out lately.  Also these girls smoking hot.
B00000ILDE|5.0|\\"Aliens\\" is the shining star of this series.  James Cameron produced a masterpiece which succeeds on multiple levels.  The movie provides white-knuckled, edge of your seat excitement.  The scenes with the colonial Marines preparing to descend to planet LV-417 are superb and build the tension.      Sigourney Weaver as Ripley excels as the on-board Cassandra warning the high-tech warriors that all their vaunted weaponry and arrogance may fare poorly against the potent xenomorph.  A terrific supporting cast too.  Sprinkled throughout the taut thriller is some funny as hell dialogue and lines which will have you slapping your knees.    A masterpiece that survives multiple viewings 22 years after it was first released!
B00014X8KO|4.0|Even though I was not a huge fan of \\"Akira\\", I could see that the work Otomo did with the animation was outstanding. In this production, the legendary artist and director, delivers three stories (directed by others) that are not as spectacular in terms of the graphics, but that more than compensate for this with the quality of their plots.<br /><br />In Magnetic Rose, a spaceship that is ready to return home after one of their typical and uneventful missions gets a distress signal and has to provide assistance. Upon arrival, they find a strange ship, inside what looks like an asteroid. Thus starts a wonderful story, that makes us use our brain throughout its duration and leaves us thinking afterwards. The beautiful Opera music brings an emotion to the action that I have seldom seen in the genre. This was my favorite piece of this set.<br /><br />Stink Bomb has a completely different flavor; it is highly entertaining, but consists of a much more linear story. A scientist fighting a cold is looking for relief and takes a pill from his boss' office thinking it is an experimental cold medicine. To his surprise it is a bio weapon that has some pretty nasty effects on humans and animals around him. This is definitely an original view on a doomsday scenario.<br /><br />Finally, in Cannon Fodder we find a society dedicated to waging war. Kids in school study trigonometry to understand how to find the theoretical location of the target and aim accurately. Men work manning the cannons, which are present all over the city. Women are in charge of manufacturing the bullets. The story is interesting but compared to the other two I found it to be too slow at times. The message is conveyed loud and clear though.<br /><br />The common denominator across these stories is that they make you think. This is not the typical anime, with a hero fighting against the evil guys. Instead we find stories that have many layers and messages for the viewer to discover and ponder. As I mentioned before, the graphics are not the best I have seen, but they are still pretty good. Those that are looking for a more meaningful and complex anime experience should definitely investigate this collection.best I have seen, but they are still pretty good.

B000ZLFALI|1.0|Just finished watching this film for the first time and my hopes of a lovely Beatles tribute were dashed. What were they thinking? It looked like the film was being made up as it went along. Whimsical nonsense pretending to be sincere. My friend said it seemed like it was made by someone who didn't really live in the 60's but only imagined what it must have been like. Even though the original Beatles songs are great, this movie managed to dull and distort even these masterpieces of enduring artistic excellence. I would not recommend this film to anyone except for perhaps the very young who otherwise would not listen or be exposed to the Beatles songs in any other format as even this movie couldn't completely demolish their brilliance.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|still cant get over how great the picture quality is.
B000002UTY|5.0|A rare live album of a much underated 60's band. Excellent guitar playing with the usual long solos that were a part of live 60's performances. This album, I think I am right in saying was rated in the top 200 of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. I thoroughly recommend it!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The only thing I want to add to what others have said is that I'm now convinced the best way to watch \\"Lost\\" is on DVD. I just recently watched all of the previous three seasons in order to get ready for the new season. I was watching the episodes in bunches - at least two at a time and often four together. It was great! But now that I'm watching the current episodes they seem sooooo short. They end way too soon! But, no, I'm not going to stop watching and wait for the next DVD set to come out. I did that midway through the second season because my DVR failed to record an episode. I immediately stopped watching the show that year and patiently waited for the DVD release. The show's ratings took a hit at about the same time. I wonder how many other people did what I did?  \\"Lost\\" is easily the richest, most absorbing, thought-provoking show on television. I have no idea how they can make the ending live up to the rest of the show but I'll be there faithfully to the very last episode.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|No wonder Bob Dylan took these two on Tour with him as his Opening Act.     Reality attracts. This is the ultimate reality experience on film.   In all the attempts at spontaneity, at genuineness, at transparency, at congruence, i.e., the outside and the inside being inescapably equal, there has never been a better depiction of an incredible tale of serendipitous surrender, of the love of music before all else.     Go. See. Enjoy. Laugh. Cry. Sing. Dance.   Do it all...
B000V78BOY|5.0|This is a really good performance of the opera. It's sung in German and done \\"modern style\\" and is still very enjoyable. I found Will Hartmann to be a little elderly for the part of Tamino, who needs the inexperience of youth to really fill the role, but his voice is gorgeous. The Queen of the Night hits that top F with no problem at all and sings the arias with plenty of drama and clarity particularly in the coloratura, and although the three boy's voices are a little dry they're still excellent singers. Monostatos is particularly good in this performance - it's a part which is often less well sung than some of the other roles, but here he's top notch.<br /><br />The Papageno is also excellent and compares well with the Bergman film from Drottningholm in the 1970s and also with Benjamin Luxon's version of the character in the late 70s/early 80s. I loved the puppet bird that he had to catch during his first aria (when he does the belly flop at the end and slides across the stage), and the masks of the animals when Tamino charms them in the woods are superb. The only thing that spoiled the performance for me was that the make-up and hairstyles for the Three Ladies and Queen of the Night is very unflattering and in close up filming doesn't work that well.<br /><br />All in all this is most enjoyable and well deserving of five stars.
B000050XEI|4.0|If anything, I'd say it's too short. (34:26)    Nice music, though. Especially 'Tempus'.

B0000025YM|5.0|Priest's greatest release ever.  There are at least six other Priest releases right behind it.  Great, dark, lustful lyrics which are about women for me.  Defenders was the last great Priest release until Painkiller.  The guitar lead breaks are second to none.  Tom Allom's production is perfect.  Halford never sounded more intense or better.  Simply put, a metal masterpiece of the highest caliber.    Freewheel Burning
B000Z8GZYW|1.0|I have always been a Bill Murray fan.  This movie is dull, it goes beyond repetitious, and it gets so old after the second iteration, its not funny.  The only benefit I can think of from watching this video is that it may dull your senses into slumber if you are an insomniac.
B00008L3NK|1.0|Harnoncourt music making is like a first class scientific experiment. A lot of tricks based on intellectual research and profound knowledge of historical performance traditions. It is like watching a documentary on Discovery channel. One keeps wondering at things never seen before. If you buy this DVD you will hear Strauss sounding in a way you haven't heard before. I don't find it particularly beautiful. It is odd, it is dry and the musicians try not to watch the conductor, since his gesture is always behind the sound. There is something rather creepy about the way he approaches this music. There is no joy, no excitement and no moments of spontaneous music making. It is the weakest, most bizarre Neujahrskonzert ever.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Four stars for the 1st of a tragic swashbuckling film. This is the first film I saw in over a decade, literally, emerging from a self-imposed culture fast. My techno, pop culture, modern movie-making technics lack allowed me to see this film, not only as a connector to the original Star Wars (which blew my socks off seeing it in a first run theater so many eons ago) but as an incredible advance in movie making. Since this film I've had the pleasure of seeing a few more incredible movies that draw on the Marin people and Pixar.    As for the story, it dragged in places and I wanted to see Liam Neelson do more acting.     Who was the masked bad guy? Incredible technic. I would like to see him in action.    Finally, Obiwan - it becomes clear from this snap shot that the faults of the teacher propagate and intensify as they pass through to the pupil. Fringe teacher (Gauwan) to rebellious student (Obiwan) to a break with law (Anakin).    Thanks for a good movie.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|The film explores sense of adventure above retapping brotherhood. There is something exceedingly self confident about The Darjeeling Limited. The first scene features a chase to catch a train and the first of the three actors to appear is Adrien Brody. Adrien Brody is the apparently the most comfortable,yet clumsy of the three stars in this film. Brody's demeanour as Peter is remarakble and the prescription sunglasses were humored.<br /><br />Owen Wilson. Well, I won't lie. After the controversy that surrounded the man in recent times and his personal struggles, I wanted to see this film even more. It is his most memorable performance and he truly is a star in this film, a bit like a big brother figure what have you. Overall, it felt good to see him back on his feet chasing trains and electric plugs (you'll know)<br /><br />Jascon Schwartzman. He surprises me with how well an underplayer of an actor he is. Whether it's frantically chasing an Indian woman or running down a hill or even masterfully causing fire, his character wins. I loved how he carried his music around and had not a word to speak.<br /><br />Combine these three, some sweet coffees, temples cigarettes, band aids, pills, eyedrops, cough medicines, liquor, electric plugs, Indian villagers, coolies (the guys who lift your baggage at trainstations across India), shrines, BILL MURRAY, canals, cricket with tennis balls, funerals, young Indian boys and big hearts,  , taxis, fellow Sikhs, peacock feathers, phoney spiritualism, poisonous snakes, a Laurel and Hardy'ish willingness to fight...and much more - the movie prevails as one of quality and comradery in adventure.<br /><br />Overall, a heatening effort, must watch.
B00005RG6B|5.0|Veamos, si bien puedo ser poco objetivo con respecto a Queensryche y mas tratandose del material de Operation Mindcrime, hay pocas cosas que se pueden objetar con respecto a este DVD, la puesta en escena de la banda es impecable, el sonido es demoledor, el material supremo y solo tal vez lo unico que se puede criticar es la calidad del video, PERO como de costumbre si bien podrian haber intentado mejorar la calidad del mismo, cosa que tal vez si se hizo, tampoco es para defenestrar semejante obra de arte, despues de todo estamos hablando de algo grabado hace mas de 15 años y tambien si la decision fue dejar el material lo mas proximo a su orignal tambien esta correcto, de hecho no creo que sea tampoco una cosa tan grave como para bajarle puntos a semejante DVD. Los extras, a mi en particular, mucho no me interesan si bien hay veces que algunas cosas son interesantes yo compro los DVD por el material principal, en este caso, el recital que es maravilloso. En resumen, COMPREN ESTE DVD, creo que podria entrar sin temor a equivocarme entre los 10 mejores DVD en vivo que he visto, y Queensryche a pesar de que sus ultimos trabajos no han sido de la calidad de Operation nadie les puede quitar el credito de haber compuesto uno de los mejores discos del Heavy.  Saludos, Gastón.
B000OHZL1C|5.0|As wonderful as this film is on standard DVD, it was worth my plunge into HD-DVD to see this magnificent film in high definition. It's totally extraordinary.     The exquisite production design has added depth and richness I would never have imagined. The camerawork is masterful. The Thomas Newman music score is so beautifully married to the film it takes my breath away time and again.   It's a long movie (3 hours, give or take a few minutes), but it always seems too short to me.     I think this movie is a modern classic that will sear itself into your memory if you are capable of sitting and letting a story take hold of you while it is unfolding in front of you.    I've watched \\"Meet Joe Black\\" many times. For anyone who has seen it and is confused about the story line, here is a both a SPOILER and my own understanding of the relationship between \\"Joe\\" and Claire within the story:    Bill Parrish is a wealthy communications giant whose time to \\"move on\\" is near. He is having small heart attacks, and he is hearing a voice. \\"Yes\\" is the answer. The speaker is \\"Death\\". The question, unasked, is Bill's. The question is \\"Am I dying\\"?.    \\"Death\\", however, is fascinated with Bill Parrish and his lifestyle. \\"Death\\" has been watching Bill Parrish for quite some time. Indeed, he has also been watching Bill's family. He seizes on an opportunity that comes along when a \\"charming fellow\\" played by Brad Pitt meets Parrish's daughter Claire in a coffee shop -- \\"charming fellow\\" turns her head. They are both smitten with possibilities, but each lets the other go his/her separate way. The \\"charming fellow\\" - distracted in a busy street intersection where he stopped to take one more look -- gets hit by two different vehicles. No one could have survived such a traumatic accidnet.    \\"Death\\" arrives at Bill Parrish's doorstep. But he's not there to take Bill right away. He has taken a body (Pitt's) and wants to experience life in the manner that Parrish lives it. As \\"Death\\" -- now known as \\"Joe Black -- integrates himself into Bill Parrish's life, Claire falls in love with \\"Joe\\". At first, she's confused when she meets \\"Joe\\" because he doesn't seem like the same \\"charming fellow\\" she talked with in the coffee shop....the guy who turned her head and made her realize that \\"maybe\\" she wasn't really with the right person (i.e. Drew).    Everything about \\"Joe\\" is unique and wonderful to Claire. She nails the issue when she declares, after a beautifully filmed love scene, that making love with \\"Joe\\" is like making love to someone \\"who is making love for the first time.\\"    At the climactic birthday party, when Joe is considering asking Claire to go with him, she is given a glimpse into who Joe really is. Joe imparts this to Claire, much in the same way that he imparted a glimpse into the next life to the old woman in the hospital. When she sees him...and says, \\"Oh! I see...you're.....you're......'Joe'!\\" she is saying she understands, even if she cannot possibly fathom how it was possible. That is when \\"Joe\\" realizes that Claire cannot possibly follow him...that he loves her too well to take her physical life from her.    Restoring the \\"charming fellow\\" to life was \\"Joe's\\" gift to her. \\"Charming fellow's\\" memories had stopped from the moment he watched her turn the corner the one time they had met several days before...and all the rest was blurred....because the same \\"Death\\" who was going to take Bill Parrish was the same \\"Death\\" who was there to take the \\"charming fellow\\". Instead, \\"Death\\" left that fellow in a limbo while assuming his physical form (and, presumably, healing it). When \\"Death\\" took Bill Parrish, he returned \\"charming fellow\\" to his body...and there he was walking back toward Claire and probably thinking he has smoked one doobie way too many.    Claire, at first hopeful, soon realizes it's the \\"charming fellow\\" and knows her dad is gone and that \\"Joe\\" has taken him/gone with him. She was in love with \\"Joe\\" and \\"charming fellow\\" has noclue that love might be in the offing, but he knows something special exists between them. She, too, realizes that \\"charming fellow\\" was \\"Death's\\" tool and a gift.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|I thought the movie was mediocre at best.  Spielberg failed to make any case, relative to terrorism, response to terrorism and their costs to those that fight or engage in either.    Based on any number of books, including \\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas, Spielberg's story misrepresented history for what purpose I am not willing to conceive.   It is important to relate history accurately in some fashion, and his changing of the facts certainly makes the Israelis appear similarly cruel and randomly violent if not worse that the terrorists.  Munich was only one of an extraordinarily large number of terrorist atrocities perpetrated against Israel and its supporters.  The Munich terrorist attack was just the catalyst for the Israeli response, hardly an unmeasured response as depicted in the movie.    To his credit, I think Spielberg tried to keep the Munich horror alive through the movie with the continued flashbacks, but those short bursts of terrorism failed to overcome the constant and violent portrayal of the Israelis as they tracked and assassinated the planners and financiers of the terrorism.  I wish there were a better way to bring terrorists to justice; I'm not at all certain there is a more effective method, certainly when they are protected democratic and totalitarian governments alike.    I suspect the movie accurately projects what we will continue to see as harsh measures necessary to combat terrorism, and for that I agree with the movie.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|This a great album. I really enjoyed it. I think it is the better of the three albums.
B000YA9R3C|4.0|P.T. Anderson is one of the more interesting filmmakers working today, and one of the most maddening. I've seen all his films, and will continue to see them, which says something, yet while I usually go into a P.T. Anderson film hoping to love it, because it looks so good on paper, I invariably end up leaving disappointed, frustrated, empty, with the sense that the movie could have should have been so much better if only it had been imbued with certain qualities, namely emotional and intellectual depth. There Will Be Blood is Anderson's best film, and in some ways is close to being a masterpiece, but ultimately it left me with the same feeling of emptiness as the others and with a boatload of reservations. TWBB is an unqualifiedly interesting film, but is it unqualifiedly great? I would have to say no. Part of me thinks that it is a great film, the rest of me thinks it is only pretty good. In order to explain this ambivalence it is necessary for me to explain my feelings toward the director himself.    The snobbish critic David Thomson(who strangely enough reveres Anderson) derides directors such as Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese for \\"knowing more about film than they know about life.\\" I think that description applies to Anderson more than it does to anyone else. I get the sense that P.T. Anderson(The Man Who Would Be Kubrick, or Scorsese, or Fill In The Name Of Director Here) doesn't filter the scenes in his films through the prism of his own real life experiences, he filters them through his idiosyncratic artistic conceits and most of all through his experiences watching other people's films, and as a result his movies come across as quirky for the sake of being quirky, movieish for the sake of being movieish. An example of this is the much discussed ending of There Will Be Blood, which borrows heavily from Stanley Kubrick, particularly A Clockwork Orange. Like Orange, TWBB ends with its protagonist uttering a deadpan one-liner dripping with irony, \\"I'm finished\\" instead of \\"I was cured.\\" Like Kubrick, Anderson juxtaposes a spirited piece of classical music(in this case Brahms instead of Rossini) with visions of violence and depravity. It's as if, while mapping out this scene, Anderson asked himself, \\"What would Stanley Kubrick do?\\" Fine, if you're looking for filmic inspiration you can't do much better than Kubrick. The problem is, the black comic tone of the finale is completely inappropriate to the rest of the film. In effect, Anderson's films end up being amalgams of interesting, often great scenes that don't really cohere, that just remind the viewer of the works of superior directors(Kubrick, Altman, Scorsese, Huston, Welles...). Anderson seems insistent that none of his scenes be boring or predictable, hence we get instances in TWBB of Daniel Plainview beating the hell out of Eli Sunday for no apparent reason. Is this really how the character would react in these circumstances? Or is it just Anderson thinking, every scene in every one of my movies must serve to augment my pedigree as a brilliant artiste, therefore I'm just going to give free reign to my idiosyncrasies and if people don't like it, the hell with them, they're Philistines anyway? Does he intentionally underdevelop his characters for the sole purpose of being able to get away with such weirdness, allowing himself to fall back on a cushion of artistic ambiguity? In other words, you can't really question the motivation of a character you don't understand, right? In the same vein, why does Plainview's adopted son H.W. spend the entire film with the same dull, oblique look on his face? One gets the impression that Anderson saw a character in another film with a similarly unwavering expression(Barry Lyndon perhaps?), thought it was cool, and wanted to copy the effect, because it really does little toward creating any empathy for the boy. Since H.W. is such a cipher anyway, we never question his steadfast bemusement. It's rather ironic, isn't it, that Anderson expects his audience to be disturbed by the way Plainview uses his son as a prop, even though the filmmaker himself is no better. H.W. is nothing more than a prop in the film, a vehicle for showing how emotionally stunted his adoptive father is. By the way, in the book Oil! the boy is actually the central character, we see the events through his eyes, and in effect he is a three-dimensional person. For me, this represents a missed opportunity on Anderson's part, a chance to provide the audience with symnpathetic counterpoint to the twisted megalomaniacal father figure rather than a half-formed child who goes deaf as a pretext for shuttling him off to San Francisco, and out of the story, and who doesn't grow up until the last act. Again, this is a case of forsaking reality in the service of inappropriate quirkiness, or movieness, or whatever you want to call it, and the result is a lack of an emotional connection between the film and the viewer.  Every Anderson movie strikes me the same way. Even the overwrought Magnolia, awash in tears, failed to elicit an emotional response, and since I approach any work of art WANTING to be deeply affected, I place the blame on Anderson's shoulders instead of my own.    But to focus solely on the negatives is to deny what a truly entertaining and engrossing film this really is. Enough has been said about Daniel Day Lewis' performance already, so I won't add to it except to say that while he's onscreen(which is most of the film) you can't take your eyes off of him. Ditto the cinematography, this is a visually stunning motion picture. I also enjoyed the music, which is discordant, sometimes to the point of being off-putting, but always appropriate to the mood and rhythm of the moment. The opening scene, though also greatly indebted to Kubrick(the beginning of 2001 to be exact, with its lack of dialogue and jarring, atonal music), is astonishing. I greatly admire Anderson's style in certain types of scenes, I loved individual episodes, I liked the movie as a whole, I'm just not entirely convinced that what I saw is a masterpiece, or that Anderson is capable of creating a masterpiece unless he stops watching movies all the time and starts focusing on the real world.    The fact that I was inspired to write this review, disjointed as it is, must indicate that I have been thinking a lot about There Will Be Blood, and I am interested in watching the picture again, which is always a good thing. Is that enough to make this a great film? The jury is still out.

Even Billy Joel and Ray, Baby Grand was an exquisite song.

B001041JLE|3.0|How do you top the greatest album of all time??? Well, simply, you don't. And since many of us probably already have a few copies of the previously released versions of Thriller, I've chosen to concentrate soley on the new material.     The Girl Is Mine 2008 is perfection! It's my absolute favorite. It can compete against the original. It's got Michael singing all new and fresh versions of the verses and ad libs. I was very impressed with the 2008 production of the track by Will.I.AM and his rap ad libs.     Wanna Be Startin Somethin 2008 is also a very nice change up to the original. There are very subtle changes to the music, but still keeping that famous bass line. Akon is a welcome addition bringing a 2008 Hip Hop feel and his own style assuring this track to be radio friendly.     PYT 2008 sounds nothing like the original--which is not a bad thing, as the original is a classic. I like what Michael and Will.I.AM did with this one. It's a very nice groove with a relaxed edge featuring Michael's championship falsetto.     Now, the bad news. Beat It and Billie Jean, arguably 2 of Michael's biggest hits of all time, we're disappointing. To me, Beat It sounds like bad karaoke(a Simon Cowell quote). The track is a watered down version of the original, and Fergie is definitely out of her league. She tries to sing opposite Michael's orginal verses, line for line (not sure anyone can do that). And, it didn't feel like Kanye did anything to Billie Jean. He should've just told Mike he couldn't think of anything. It's not bad--just nothing more, nothing less, nothing really different.     Not a bad album to have, but Mike, how many times are you going to re-distribute THRILLER? Your fans hope this is the appetizer for something new.

I did not like the unhappy ending.

Maybe your breakfast tomorrow was made in Brazil... With the currently trend of globalization, it is indeed relevant to US consumers.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road (1969) was the last album The Beatles ever recorded. Forever.<br /><br />And thankfully they left us with a symphony. Four distinct personalities came together one last time to create yet another landmark in music history. Abbey Road is a colorful, generous and thoughtful piece of art, and if given the chance it can breathe new life into a weary soul and shine warm sunlight into a cold heart. Ah, the essence of The Beatles.<br /><br />Abbey Road is an album full of highlights, and the most remarkable are two George Harrison songs. The beautiful and sincere love song, Something, and the lovely folk ballad, Here Comes The Sun, are both wonderful and timeless classics.<br /><br />John Lennon's rockin' Come Together and eerily beautiful Because are also great songs, and his I Want You (She's So Heavy) is an electric guitar new age blues masterpiece.<br /><br />Paul's bluesy Oh!Darling is a wonderfully melodic 1950s rocker that features his now famous screaming vocal performance.<br /><br />Ringo's cozy ballad Octopus's Garden adds warmth and atmosphere to the album, and along with Maxwell's Silver Hammer is just plain fun.<br /><br />Even with all of these great moments, the centerpiece of the album is \\"the medley\\". Eight song fragments pieced together to sound so effortlessly complete that it seems as if they were composed as a contiguous symphony. It begins with You Never Give Me Your Money which blends into the four-part harmonies of Sun King. The bouncy Mean Mr. Mustard crashes into the somewhat perverted Polythene Pam and then into the rollicking She Came In Through The Bathroom Window. The piano and orchestra accompanied lullabye, Golden Slumbers, is contemplative and tender.<br /><br />Once there was a way to get back homeward<br />Once there was a way to get back home<br />Sleep pretty darling do not cry<br />And I will sing a lullabye<br /><br />Golden Slumbers fill your eyes<br />Smiles awake you when you rise<br /><br />Carry That Wieght continues the medley with a Ringo Starr drum solo and back n' forth guitar dueling between John, Paul, and George. The sweeping and melodic wisdom of The End completes the medley, and then is followed by an amusing little afterthought, Her Majesty, to end the album.<br /><br />Abbey Road is one the best selling albums of all time (although Sgt. Pepper has sold more), and because it was The Beatles last, one of the world's most cherished. When listened to as a single piece of work, Abbey Road is a masterpiece of artistic beauty unlike anything the world will ever see or hear again.<br /><br />Thank Goodness John, Paul, George and Ringo decided to COME TOGETHER in THE END for SOMETHING Beatles fans will always treasure.hn, Paul, and George.

0307341550|4.0|I can not think of another word to describe this book.  It's like watching a train wreck and all you can do is stand there.  Like some other reviewers, I read this book in less than 2 days. I could not put it down.  It is so bad that you just do not think that it can get worse but it does.  It leads you right up to the end with the questions.  Thankfully all is solved and each peg is put into a hole but you close the book still shaking your head and wondering about all of the evils and demons in this world of ours.  Not a light read.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|There is little doubt that \\"Blow-Up\\" is a stunning piece of film-making. There is very little dialog in the film, and when people do talk to each-other there is mis-communication. No, Antonioni uses imagery and non-verbal sounds to convey meaning in this film. Combined with a strange, disconnected - seemingly pointless plot - Antonioni creates the feeling of a dream.<br /><br />David Hemmings is excellent in the lead role of a detached, selfish, impulsive photographer in swinging sixties London - although his character is unappealing to say the least. Unfortunately the film has some dated elements including blatant misogynism, which drag it down one star.
0743298039|5.0|I loved this book from the first page.  So engrossing!  Talk about a tangled woven plot, this is it!  I truly enjoyed this book and could not bare to put it down. It never became boring as some books do. I LOVED IT!  Waiting with baited breath for the next book by this author!
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Case in point: MGMT vs. my present playlist. Listening to, for example, The Youth or Of Moons, Birds & Monsters, I hear sounds that are so 'out there' I really can't make a connection between them and the instrument, including vocal chords, that are producing them. I suppose I'm beginning to rant, like others, about the detrimental effects of over-production. Well the problem's real. It seems that the big players in the music industry believe that more volume (thanks to reverb, music compression and every other techno piece of trickery) translates into more sales. Well, perhaps it does (shame on you ignorant consumers)! However, the true value of any form of art is lost with its subtleties. Fortunately, the 4th Dimensional Transition exercises enough restraint to avoid these post-production pitfalls. All this is quite clinical, but don't think that I've missed the vitality of MGMT's music. It's definitely there, somewhere beneath the foundation, blush and eyeliner.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Now, why with all the sad, angry faces,comic book fans? If you all just think about it, \\"ULTRAVIOLET\\" is something to look forward to. I'm not saying this to be perfect, I'm saying this to give this movie a second try. I do agree that it was too short in theatres, but when it came out in DVD, it was Extended. So, give it some credit. Milla Jovovich to me was a dynamic, spitting image of the heroine, Violet. She came prepared and we should be happy about that. Blood wars, Vampire-like diseases, a neat-freak nemesis, 9 or 10 bad guys, nonstop action and boy who can really save himself. What more can you guys ask for? I'm giving it a two thumbs up,an A+ and a round of applause. Try to convince me that you hated it, but I know, you loved it.
0316067598|1.0|I could go on about my relations to the United States Special Forces or my military experience or my families sacrifices during the current war but there's no point.  It's the internet and anyone can say anything without having to prove their word, so I'll not bother.    What I don't understand is Mr. Luttrells' obvious need to prove something to the reader.  He's a Navy SEAL, what else is there to prove?    As a professional soldier Luttrell spends far too much time attempting to justify his nations policies and somehow prove that in performing his duties he and his team and his country are in the 'right'.    As a sworn soldier of the United States his focus should have been much more about following his oath and his conscience.  What does it matter is the Commander in Chief is right or wrong?  You've received a lawful order and now you follow it to the best of your ability.  There's no time or space to be worried about the policy makers decisions or the media's opinion.  You do your godamned job, quietly and professionally.    Does Mr. Luttrell believe that we need heroes forced down our throats?  Is not the fact that those brave men fought and died for ideals that they held dear, regardless of public opinion, not make them heroes?  They put their one and only bodies between their homes and wars desolation, nothing more need be said.    A professional doesn't need to hate his enemy, disparage him or dehumanize him, he need only to defeat him.      He also fails to note something very important about the Rules of Engagement: They are mission specific.  The term, 'weapons free' exists for a reason.    I wonder if Luttrell has taken time to consider how he would feel about a group of people infiltrating his home state of Texas to kill or capture a known murderer and their decision to kill three Americans who stumbled across them during their mission.
B00005MP58|5.0|I always like the DVD movies that come with many special features. Unfortunately, this DVD release doesn't have too many such features.  However, I find myself enjoying the movie too much to fault the DVD release itself for the lack of extras.  As others have said, it's quite an enjoyable movie.  The fact that it follows the book very closely, and therefore is several hours long, only adds to its overall charm.    I also like turning on subtitles, so while there is no subtitle of any kind available on the DVD (a disappointment), I found that allowing the TV to activate its Closed Caption feature did allow the text of the dialogue to be visible.  I saw this work on two different TVs so I hope others who like subtitles can have the same success.
0061251305|5.0|I have read many books on leadership, and this one really broke through to a deeper level of understanding for me. My key takeaway is that people within organizations operate within complex systems, or tribes. Better still, the book outlined how to leverage these natural tribes for the betterment of the entire organization. This book offers a great analysis of how culture impacts performance without simplifying the idea by assuming that there is a single monolithic culture within an organization. This book takes a deep look at how high-performance cultures impact the success of a company, and I use the concepts from \\"Tribal Leadership\\" within my own business on a daily basis.

B0000WN0ZK|1.0|Yes, I tried to appreciate it.  I stuck with it, watched it all the way through.  Yes, I paid attention.  And I was still left with a feeling that I had wasted nearly two hours.    The director spends the first 25 minutes showing us an obnoxious, loathsome photographer and the women he treats like objects while working with them.  Then he finally gets around to taking the pictures in the park that will figure into the plot later.  Eventually, there is a scene in a little building where a rock band is playing and the audience members sit there like they're at a funeral, while the guitarist rips off Pete Townshend by smashing his guitar.  Why the photographer went into this stupid concert in the first place is beyond me.  For that matter, why did he visit the antiques shop?   Why are there so many shots of him walking and driving?  All they do is take up screen time that could have been devoted to better pacing and an actual plot.  He finds a body, tells some useless friend of his about it, goes back to look for it, and surprise!  It's gone.  Well, did he think it was just going to stay there out in the open for weeks on end?   The ending is equally irritating, with the photographer watching some stupid bunch of performers/mimes pretending to play tennis.  And again I ask, what was the point of all this?
B000068FY0|4.0|Back in the mid 1970s, the launch of \\"Crime of the Century\\" was a question for Rock music fans. Another \\"Progressive\\" group? An alternative answer to Symphonic Rock?  Together with ingenious lyrics and the use of keyboards, sax and even harmonica, this British band issued a series of successful albums.<br /><br />The first one to consider, obviously, is this \\"Crime of the Century\\". To be noticed: first CD reissues captured the mid-to-low sound quality of the LP version. Luckily, people at A&M/Universal Music decided to reissue a remastered version. No extra tracks, no additional features, but the sound quality has been improved.<br /><br />If you want to remind the best times of Rock music (the 70s), get this album, as well as \\"Breakfast in America\\" and \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\".
B000YA9R3C|4.0|Intense, shrewd and ultimately crazed not only applies to Daniel Plainview, the wily exploiter of resources, both mineral and human, who is brought to living, breathing, complex life by Daniel Day Lewis, but in some ways also to this weird and idiosyncratic film that is its own crazy testament to the collaboration of two brilliant, obsessive filmmakers, the aforementioned Mr. Day Lewis and the equally passionate Paul Thomas Anderson.    The film touches on two major threads of, especially American, life: entrepreneurial commerce and fundamental religion, that in their benign forms have contributed to the energy and elevation of American history and life, but in their more deranged incarnations have brought untold misery and tragedy. Here we see the passion and drive produced by both and how these passions can be manipulated and directed and how wielding and bending these powerful forces can ultimately warp and pervert the manipulators themselves.  Absolute power, ya know?    Lewis's Daniel Plainview lives for one thing only, the capture and exploitation of oil.  It is turn-of-the-century America, and a man with guts and drive and shrewd savvy can create his own wealth and empire, if he has the daring and nerve.  Plainview has all of that and a corresponding amorality and misanthrope that allows him free rein to do whatever he deems necessary.  He will use any means or person to achieve his end, and we come to see that the end isn't the acquiring of wealth, it is the \\"acquiring\\" itself.  It is the \\"using\\" of the land and the people on it, it is the exploitation of human and mineral resources that is his ultimate satisfaction, if such a restless and disdainful spirit can ever truly know satisfaction, peace, or any form of recognizable human happiness.     Daniel Day Lewis's Plainview is a complex and astonishing portrayal.  His speech cadences bear a subtle and eerie similarity, without being derivative, to the late John Huston's, and this created, for me, a hauntingresonance of Plainview as a younger version of the complete, total, and very human monster that was Huston's Noah Cross in Chinatown, another entrepreneurial magnate whose amorality allowed him to be \\"capable of anything\\".    Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is first rate, and his bravado in creating such an eccentric film of a strange and compelling era in American history, little thought of nor reflected upon in our times, and yet the source of many of the wonderful and awful themes still playing themselves out in American life today, fulfills a promise made by a man willing to climax a film about modern Southern California with a Biblical rain of frogs.  Anderson has the daring and the passion and he has found the perfect match for his material in his lead actor.  The supporting cast, crew and crafts have all likewise done their work well.    It is not a perfect film, it's a tad long and has its diversions and occasional sidetracks, and the ending seems a bit contrived, but only a little.  We must see that in the end Plainview's ruthless grip is a grasp upon nothing more than his own vanity and the final emptiness of avarice.  He is \\"finished\\".  Well worthwhile for those willing to let the film play out in its own way, and it has at its core an unforgettable, complex and mesmerizing central character and performance.
0316113506|5.0|As someone who works from home, I got this book shortly after my 30th birthday came and went, and I was still moving slowly on my resolution to exercise more. To that end, this book was the kick in the backside - literally - that I needed to get up and moving more.     I'm glad I bought this instead of buying a typical how-to exercise book with a shirtless guy on the cover - rather than filling your head with inane tricep curls and painful ab crunchers, it focuses on keeping things simple, just getting up and moving. And it explains the science behind it all: As a pretty analytical person I need to know HOW things happen - how does a plane get up off the ground, how does the stock market work, and now, how my brain and body are interconnected. This book makes me interested because it explains the how and why, rather than just preaching and shouting.    But, though there's hard science at every turn here, the writing is extremely coherent and understandable to a non-physics-major like me. The tone is accessible and encouraging, while being substantial and authoritative.    Before you go out and get an armful of fitness or exercise books, this one is required reading, because it lays down the set of fundamentals and facts that will inspire you to get moving. Highly recommended!

B000YENUI6|3.0|\\"Eastern promises\\" is the first film for David Cronenberg that was shot entirely outside his native Canada and it is the second film of Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen - after \\"The History of Violence\\" (2005). It should be mentioned that Viggo Mortensen had done a very impressive research for his Oscar-nominated role of Nikolai Luzhin, a modest driver and also an \\"undertaker\\" and a hit-man for the Russian mafia boss in London. Mortensen alone, without a translator, had traveled across Russia, visiting the Urals Mountains where his character came from, and also stopped in Moscow and St.-Petersburg. Mortensen diligently learned Russian to make the Russian phrases of Siberian Nikolai sound more naturally. He also studied the literature on Russian prisons and their unofficial kings, \\"vory v zakone\\" or thieves in the law, the most respected and feared criminals. The script was written by Stephen Knight whose previous film on the subject of the emigrants in modern London, \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" (2002), proves that he is a talented writer. Sadly, the script is the weakest part of \\"Eastern Promises\\" and while watching the movie I thought that it had deserved the better writing. The story is predictable from the very beginning and it lacks subtlety. All twists and turns are clearly seen a mile away. Even with the obvious problems in the script, \\"Eastern promises\\" is an interesting film - intense, gloomy, dark, and violent. David Cronenberg's directing is laconic, non sentimental, almost clinical and always virtuoso. The gruesome fight scene in the Turkish Baths is a masterpiece, the way it was choreographed and shot. Cronenberg must have used the knowledgeable Russian consultants on the set and I was pleasantly surprised that the Russian phrases sound naturally, and pronunciation and intonations of the non-Russian actors were believable. Besides Mortinsen, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent Casselas as Nikolai's horrifying boss and his creepy son, are especially memorable. Surprisingly, Naomi Watts whom I adore in every movie I've seen her, plays the least interesting character and I attribute it to the weaknesses of the script.<br /><br />3.5/5 or 7/10singly, Naomi Watts whom I adore in every movie I've seen her, plays the least interesting character and I attribute it to the weaknesses of the script.     3.5/5 or 7/10
0691131511|4.0|This is a fine and imaginative introduction to the Eastern Roman Empire (known as the Byzantine Empire to modern historians) for the general reader.  However, on page 13 it states: \\"....the last Roman emperor in the West was deposed in 476, leaving a half-Vandal, half-Roman general, Stilicho, in control of Italy.\\" This is a gross error.  Anyone with a basic knowledge in ancient Roman history knows that Stilicho was murdered in 408 under the orders of the emperor Honorius. It was a German general,Odoacer, in the sercive of the western \\"Roman army\\" (by then Roman in name only) who deposed the last western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus in 476.     I find it shocking that such a mistake is to be found in a book by an excellent scholar such as Herrin. It mars an otherwise enjoyable account. Perhaps this is just another example of the increasingly poor editing and error-laden works of history that have appeared since the age of computer editing. Sad.  But this book is still worth reading for its fine writing and lively descriptions of the Byzantine world.
0307346617|4.0|Where to begin?<br /><br />I would be willing to say that Max Brooks has given us a \\"new classic\\" of zombie literature in World War Z.  The novel is well-structured, is well-paced, and seems so ... plausible.<br /><br />And when I say \\"plausible\\", I mean the Brooks has tried to carefully -- though not necessarily exhaustively -- look at the current geopolitical climate and imagine what a sudden \\"zombie\\" outbreak scenario would look like today or in some tenable near-future.  Brooks makes what seems to me to be a sincere effort to leave no logistical stone uncovered: how does the plague spread? what are the consequences of a government cover-up? what about the navies and submarines? what about satellites and GPS? how do you \\"quartermaster\\" an army that is on foot going up against \\"the undead\\"?  He tried to cover all the bases in as realistic a way as possible.  Considering such an unrealistic scenario.  Again: Brooks is not trying to be exhaustive but considering where he puts his focus, he certainly comes across as inventive.  He gives us some sadistic twists throughout the narrative; for every up-lifting deus ex machina near-miss (e.g., Col. Eliopolis and \\"Mets Fan\\") there is some grim and ironic counterpoint (e.g., the slaughter at [...]).  Wisely, Brooks tries to keep these stories diverse: military and civilian; American and Chinese; young and old; optimistic and jaded.  He does not waste a great deal of energy discussing \\"Zack\\"; there is no in depth technical discussion of the virus -- just a few allusions to methods of transmission (those bites) and then we move on to what matters.  That is where Brooks keeps the focus: it's on how people -- be they individuals or entire governments -- react to these extreme scenarios.  And he does a decent job peeling the peach of the technological modernity while he's catapulting us through this tale.<br /><br />Two closing points:<br /><br />(1) Brooks is also graciously humble.  He cites George A. Romero in the acknowledgments; can't get far with your zombie mythos without giving the right credit.<br /><br />(2) This novel had but one thing keeping it from a full five star rating: many of the voices are not really distinct.  We are presented with the novel as if it were a historical document -- the transcripts of interviews with survivors from \\"World War Z\\".  But reading it, you can't help but think that the government official sounds an awful lot like the feral child that sounds a lot like the retired Indian army grunt...  But don't let that stop you: there is plenty else in this novel to warrant reading it.mbie mythos without giving the right credit.

B000ZLFALS|5.0|Across the universe is one of the best musical pictures I've seen in my life. I think the way the movie portraits the american way of life back in the 60's is wonderful. Excellente versions of the Beatles songs. I really recommend it, don't miss it! This is the first comment I make on Amazon, so, figure out how great the movie was for me.
B000WQW988|5.0|There are two kinds of people you can't listen to: the ones who refer to Kurt Cobain by his first name, and the ones who say Nirvana was just power cords. I'm neither.    I was already a big fan of the Unplugged CD, but I'd never seen the MTV broadcast. I bought this DVD hoping for a good show. It far exceeded my expectations.    Kurt Cobain was dead years before I ever even heard of Nirvana. I got to know Nirvana through their audio. I avoided media coverage and other people's opinions on Kurt Cobain, because I can't stand celebrity worship or misguided fascination with his suicide. The man was incredibly talented. He made great music. He put his soul into his music. He cared about his work. Those are the nicest things I can say about almost any stranger.    Anyway, the concert is great. The band knew MTV would edit the show for broadcast, and  it's relaxed, unhurried, and unaffected. The Unplugged album is a great showcase for Cobain's voice, and this show is even better. Neither the man nor his lips move much. He doesn't seem to be trying. In other words, he seems sincere. The band is infinitely more interesting to watch than any fan boy ever led me to believe. It felt good, to see this for myself. I can wear a Nirvana T-shirt now.    Cobain also seems high. He was addicted to heroin around the time this was recorded so... maybe.    Most importantly, the music is great. Better than ever. The songs felt better than new.

B00009W0U4|5.0|I never review movies, I don't have much that's helpful to say about 'em so why bother? But \\"Irreversible\\" was so tragic and brutal and emotionally damaging, to write something about it seems to release some of the psychological strain felt after experiencing it. And make no mistake, you do not just watch this movie, but experience it. Gaspar Noe's method, whether his challenging cinematic virtuosity, his unflinching depictions of horrible brutality, the actors' improvised dialogue, et cetera... all of this utterly absorbs the viewer, who becomes a very uncomfortable bystander. Many people have left the movie unfinished, too unpleasant on many levels. this would happen in the first half, in which the violence is so awful and camera techniques are dizzying and esoteric (although it parallels the chaos of the main characters' delirious, frantic search), combined with an omnipresent bass tone that unsettles the nerves even further. To call it a challenging film seems to be an understatement. As a sort of emotional ordeal, Noe's film is one of the most powerful I have seen.<br /><br />Part of the visceral effect of this film is surely its controversial depictions of graphic violence, in its infamous, horrifying rape scene and murder scene. (there is also the early setting in the underground gay club, which has plenty of nightmarish and nasty images.) It seems to cheapen the movie to bring these two scenes up in such a way like they're \\"what the movie's all about, yo!\\" -- and surely many people will come across this movie in the first place by finding it on \\"top 10 disturbing movies\\" lists or something where these scenes are invariably described. That said, I can't help but do the same thing, because in all my adult life this is the only movie where I have had to look away when it was just too much. this must be mentioned because the violence is central to the plot and the emotional onslaught (would the beautiful final scenes be so devastating if not for the viewer's knowledge of what happens, and would you even give a damn if the violence represented was just tame and trivial?). Everyone's buttons get pushed different ways of course and that's fine, but it is too easy for others to disparage this movie because of its depictions of terrible violence, but such does not make a movie bad. To attribute this brutality to a lack of morality or sensationalism is very ignorant. The murder scene is not bloody but incredibly cruel and disturbing, rendered in a fluid shot that makes it too close for comfort. When Monica Bellucci is raped and beaten it's even worse, a static shot that looks on and on for what seems like an eternity. As bad as it sounds (and it's much worse to see), this film does not sensationalize violence -- I can think of few movies that are more _anti_-violence.<br /><br />The reason for this is the structural device. On paper, this sounds like a standard rape-and-revenge tale if presented linearly. But \\"Irreversible\\" is told backwards, starting (ending) from the aftermath of the showdown with the suspected rapist to the elegiac final (beginning) scenes of tenderness and beauty and warmth before everything unravels later in the story. The violence opens the film, rather than concluding it. The title card at the movie's end (story's beginning), \\"Time destroys all things,\\" is not so much a \\"deep philosophical point\\" or anything in my opinion, but a simple summation of why \\"Irreversible\\" is so tragic. the way violence begets violence and how certain causal relations gain different meaning is interesting, but the real core of this movie is a poignant, heartbreaking message about the delicacy upon which all the beauty in life can depend. When the dialogue in later scenes `foreshadows' (if that's the right term) horrors not yet experienced by the characters, the unrecognized significance hits the viewer like a sledgehammer. Not very subtle, and pretty manipulative really, but very affecting. Actually, the scene where they make love in their apartment is beautiful but disturbing in its own way... we all understand the hitchcockian idea of suspense where the viewer knows more than the characters - well, this is like anti-suspense because we already know the outcome and it makes the film's last scenes soooo wrenching. It plays out like a memory, moving from the great ugliness of present to the comforting idyll of the past. This too is very sad if you think about it.<br /><br />Much credit must go to acting. Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassell, and Albert Dupontel are all very good and realistic, and the dialogue is largely improvised making each scene more genuine and affecting. Bellucci and Cassell were married at the time the movie was made and their intimacy underscores the relationship of their characters and their erotic scenes together are very natural and lovely. (the tunnel scene and its peculiar rapist, however, underscores rape as an act of violence, not sexuality, and Bellucci deserves kudos with her brave portrayal of this traumatizing episode.)<br /><br />This review is almost at the word limit, I have to stop but I feel like I could write a book. I don't know anything about movies anyway. SO. In one sense, it's hard to recommend this movie -- but you can probably say ex ante whether your experience with \\"Irreversible\\" will be rewarding (whether you enjoy the film or not). You may stay far away, and you may turn it off during the first 45 minutes, finding it too unbearable. And no doubt, it is deeply upsetting, but I would like to think that most people would be able to \\"handle\\" this, and an intelligent viewer should be able to appreciate the violence in context. Therefore in another sense, I highly recommend \\"Irreversible\\". It's simply an amazing film. You will not exactly _enjoy_ it, but it will haunt you for days if not weeks or longer, and provoke introspection of which few other films are capable.rtment is beautiful but disturbing in its own way... we all understand the hitchcockian idea of suspense where the viewer knows more than the characters - well, this is like anti-suspense because we already know the outcome and it makes the film's last scenes soooo wrenching.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the daughter of the Abhorsen, a man who, though able to raise the Dead, is sworn to lay them to rest. When her father fails to show up to one of their monthly visits, sending instead a Dead servant to pass along the tools of his trade, his bandolier of bells and his Charter Magic imbued sword, Sabriel knows something is Very Wrong. She must cross the Wall which divides Ancelsteirre from the Old Kingdom (and the \\"modernizing\\" world from one which contains magic, dead rising, and more) to begin a journey not only to save her father but to save the Old Kingdom (and, indeed, the world) from an old evil: a prince of the Blood turned power-hungry Dead creature determined to throw the Old Kingdom into chaos and turn it into a feeding ground for the Dead.<br /><br />Sabriel first captured my attention when I was a young teenager, just discovering true fantasy - previously I had read either adult science fiction (such as Dune or the Chronicles of Pern) or very young adults' novels, many of which contain quite a few fantastical elements. It grabbed me then and it still retains my love and has a special place on my (overstuffed) bookshelf. In it there is magic, evil, love (albeit very subdued love), danger, the hints of historical fiction (Ancelsteirre seems to resemble a 1930s or '40s England, to my mind), Death and its denizens, and a fantastical House which can protect itself with magical sendings and a spell-induced flood.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Sabriel to any lover of fantasy, regardless of what age group the reader is.

Marcus Lattrell is a hero, along with everyone who has served our country in the armed services. I say thank you to all of you and God Bless You.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I have never understood people who watch this movie and then compare it to Lord of the Rings or say that the characters resemble this person or that person from some story. Don't they realize that they are archetypes that have existed for centuries? Mythology uses these archetypes and yes Tolkein used them as well. Name a fantasy story that doesn't feature some form of adventurer/rogue? Anyway, moving on to the movie.<br />I grew up watching this movie and think it's still one of the most enjoyable fantasy flicks ever. Great acting, funny dialogue, brownies, fun action sequences, beautiful scenery, what more do you want?<br />I recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy adventures and doesn't think LOTR is the begin-all/end-all of fantasy!

B000063UR2|5.0|I grew up watching and loving this movie- the American version not the European Director's Cut. Thus this review is mostly for that version. Tim Curry as Darkness is magnificent, one of the best villains of all time. The sets, costumes and makeup are beautiful and I love the Tangerine Dream score. It's true that the special effects are dated but they are nonetheless well done for their time. I don't understand someone who watches a movie made in the eighties and then complains about the special effects. What were they expecting? Personally, I enjoy the physical effects of older movies just as much as I enjoy the CGI of contemporary movies. The story is simple, like a fairytale. Which I find appropriate seeing as how it's about unicorns and sprites!<br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fairytales and fantasy. Although this is not for young children. Some of the imagery could be frightening. Meg Mucklebones used to scare the crap out of me!

Thanks for making the vacation even more special for a little girl (and for her parents!).
B000Z6MIQS|4.0|Believe me, I am not a big fan of the electronic blips and blats that are littered throughout Simple Plan's third full length album. And I also might add that there are no less than 4 ballads on the album (one of which is a transparent re-write of Green Day's \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and the other sounds way too much like the Backstreet Boys' \\"More Than That\\"). However, there IS a spectacular ballad on the disc, the piano-laden \\"I Can Wait Forever.\\" Simple Plan is always at its best, though, when it attacks a straightforward rocker, such as \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\" and the hook-laden \\"Take My Hand.\\" The boys don't always hit the mark, but they deserve props for not putting out the same album three times in a row....or like so many bands do, soften out completely (like Relient K). There is a good bit of guitar rock here, and far more hooks than other bands in this genre crank out every few years. I give it four stars because at times the sound is intriguing, and other times it is annoying (like on the disasterously embarrasing track \\"Generation'), and although the band goes to great lengths to sound different or unique, in some form or another, you have heard all of these songs before.<br /><br />Here's a run-through of a few selected tracks:<br /><br />When I'm Gone - First single off the album, big hook & chorus, but  kind of slow-paced.<br />Take My Hand - The beat sounds exactly like The Bravery's \\"Honest Mistake\\" but the hook is very catchy.<br />Generation - Wretched synth intro, worse than Europe's \\"Final Countdown.\\" This track is embarrassing.<br />Time To Say Goodbye - Their trademark pop-punk sound.<br />I Can Wait Forever - No, this is not a cover of the song by Air Supply. This is actually a great track and the best the band has ever done. Hope you enjoy.

B0010V4TZU|2.0|the well-chosen single A-Punk is the only song with a memorable melody, which basically sounds like The Strokes covering The La's There She Goes. the rest of the album is dominated by aggressively rudimentary drumming, meandering basslines that seem oblivious to either rhythm or melody, and the faceless boyish disinterested half-spoken vocals that identify a band as \\"indie\\" in the 2000s. a few other songs reprise the same riff from A-Punk, a couple result from a Paul Simon led study in \\"afrobeat\\", a couple others use celtic melodies, but the most consistent quality is a bland sparseness which even the aforementioned novelties fail to distract from. none of Vampire Weekend's failings are unique, they're just another brick in the postpunk britpop wall.

Its amazing to understand the lifestyle these guys took on in the 80's all while their songs and albums were soaring to the top of the charts.  The book really puts you in the head of Sixx during a part of his carreer in the band Motley Crue.  Its an amazing adventure and I recommend taking the ride.

It is colorful, sturdy, creative, easy to use, and very educational. My son loves interlocking the gears and figuring out which gear \\"locks it up\\" if they suddenly won't spin.  My 1 year old loves watching the bright gears spin around too!  I would recommend this to anyone.  It also has several expansion sets, so you can keep adding on and increasing the complexity as your child gets older.  Two BIG thumbs up from our family!
B00005JPXY|1.0|The whole idea of having a point of view from a small group sounds very interesting, indeed. However, the way they conduct their \\"amateur\\" camera seems worst than any 3-year-old child holding a camera. I think it's a wrong mistake that an amateur camera could mean something like that. At end, I could see only 3 or 5 minutes of this film. The result is awful.

B000ZLFALI|3.0|ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a musical for those who love the Beatles and/or the Vietnam War era anti-war protests. Specifically, it's for those who love the Beatles though.<br /><br />Paying homage to almost all the Beatles' songs of this era, Across The Universe paints a set of narratives across the silver screen against the lyrical backdrops of such greats as `All My Loving', `Let It Be', `Come Together', and `Hey Jude' to name a very few. All of the character names are also either pulled directly from Beatles tunes (Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Sadie, etc.) or from the times (JoJo as Jimi Hendrix, etc.).<br /><br />Although very cleverly put together as a whole, the first forty minutes of the film are scattered and much of the music forced into the plot in order for it to make sense. The constrained script plugs along, trying to take wing but more often than not, falling back to Earth and trying again.<br /><br />About an hour into the film, however, Across The Universe finds its wings and gets aloft. After Max (Joe Anderson) gets inducted into the military, there's an incredible sequence in which we see a platoon of soldiers carrying the statue of liberty across the jungles of Vietnam. Never have I seen something so contrasting yet beautifully explored with regards to how the U.S. felt as boys were sent to fight in Southeast Asia (`Liberating' the Vietnamese by trampling down their country). The song `I Want You' is interspersed here with the lyrics \\"she's so...heavy!\\" cut from it. Amazingly done.<br /><br />The story is really about love and tolerance during a time of incredible bloodshed and governmental turmoil. Lead actors Jim Sturgess (as Jude) and Evan Rachel Wood (as Lucy) do a fine job of making us care about this conflicted couple and how in love they eventually become thanks to their similarities but also their differences. Jude wants to stay out of the war and focus on his artwork, while Lucy is forced into the Peace Movement when her brother (Max) gets drafted and shipped out. Lucy finds that peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.<br /><br />The drug culture is explored in-depth as our would-be lovers trek across the U.S. in a psychedelic bus after drinking some \\"purple punch.\\" The visuals are wild, and the colors even wilder as their \\"experience\\" drops them into the hands of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard, [[ASIN:B000J4QW8Q My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]) who sings, not surprisingly, `Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.'\\" His blue buddies are indicative of the LSD experience for those who wanted to \\"turn on, tune in, and drop out.\\"<br /><br />The ending is well rendered if a bit predictable. Love cannot be denied amongst these terrible times, so Jude and Lucy must find a way to make theirs work.<br /><br />If it weren't for the terrible beginning, this film would've gotten an easy five star rating. But it faltered so much in those first forty minutes that I'd be lying to myself if I said the middle and end made up for all of it. It didn't. But Across The Universe is still a musical worth watching. Just get past the beginning and you'll be swept up in the nostalgic music and characters.peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.

B000URDEB0|1.0|As Patroclus was resplendent in his borrowed armour and looked the part when it came time to perform he was found to be sadly lacking, he was no Achilles and paid a heavy price. The same can be said of the new Nightwish lineup, they look the part but are not even close to performing on the same plane as the previous lineup. The name Nightwish conjures up visions of the unique sound that was refined and improved over 9 years and was regarded as the trend setter in the Power Metal genre. Tuomas Holopainen should have changed the name of the group so that fans would not be under any illusions as to what to expect.     It would also seem that the hypocrisy of Tuomas Holopainen knows no bounds. One of the main reasons he cited for the dismissal of Tarja Turunen was that she was too interested in commercializing the group, especially with regards to their tour performances where small low return countries like Australia would not be visited. Having listened to the new album I hope that this is put into practice. On the latest album we are served up a commercially attractive repertoire of songs that will appeal to the huge US market, a culture that strives for mediocrity in all things. None of this artsy opera stuff for them.     I have read many of the reviews posted about Dark Passion Play with Anette Olzon and I find it hard to believe that they are listening to the same album I am. Granted there are some instances of how good they were in the music but the force that made them great has departed, Nightwish is a disappointing shadow of it's former self. Anette Olzon's voice is just not up to the job. Save your money for something worthwhile, perhaps after Tuomas Holopainen changes the lineup a few more times he may regain the past glory that was Nightwish and forget that he sold out to commercialism.
B00004YX39|4.0|The last of the early Dan albums, and I say it's a pretty good one...  I personally prefer all prior albums to this one but it is a fitting swan song fer everything Steely.  Some awesome tunes like the title track, \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" (which features Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler on guitar-leads, and the only track with Michael McDonald backin' them vox up) & the radio staple \\"Hey Nineteen\\".    The production & musicianship on the album is as-always flawless!  I look at the album basically as the less accessible AJA, not necessarily a bad thing at all.  But I would say if you aren't a total Steely nut yet then try out maybe AJA or Can't Buy A Thrill as firsties to git your whistle soggy first...

0060935464|5.0|What can possibly be left to say about Nelle Harper Lee's classic tale of tolerance and pain, of justice denied and served, of childhood innocence lost to adolescent understanding? Surely it has all been said before in analyzing Ms. Lee's sole published novel, a surprisingly autobiographical recounting of small town Southern justice at the dawn of the pre-civil rights era - the strong sense of tradition and place, the parallelism between Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, the alternating flashes of humor and tragedy, the implicit pleas for social justice.     A work that stands as revelatory for high school freshmen necessarily loses some of that power on later rereading. However, the directness and simplicity of Harper Lee's writing, her ear for the Southern voice and eye for the telling detail, and her remarkable ability to realize memorable characters continue to impress even the mature reader. Atticus Finch stands as an archetype of the righteous but humble man seeking to serve justice and the common good, whatever the cost. Scout is the eternal tomboy, the adventurous young soul grappling with the implications of racial prejudice and injustice while experiencing and conquering her own version in Arthur (Boo) Radley. Boo himself stands as the \\"unknown other,\\" the feared immigrant or differently colored whom, as Atticus says, we can never know until we put ourselves in their skin. Then there's Dill, the summer neighbor so clearly modeled on the author's own childhood neighbor and lifelong friend, Truman Capote. These are joined by an entire townfull of supporting characters, each memorable and each an archetype in his or her own right.     Lee's master stroke as a writer was to view the events surrounding Mayella Ewell's alleged rape and Tom Robinson's trial through the eyes of a child just emerging into adolescence. Scout struggles to interpret the lives, actions, and attitudes of those around her through the lens of naïve childhood, yet her budding adolescence places her on a cusp. One day she is beating up boys and catching frogs, the next day she's being groomed for Southern womanhood. Nevertheless, Scout forces us through her questions and reactions to confront the inherent irrationality in racial and class prejudices. If it's a sin to kill a mockingbird, as the story's underlying proverb asserts, then who is Harper Lee's mockingbird? At one level, the answer is obviously Tom Robinson, seconded by Boo Radley. Yet perhaps the true mockingbird, sinfully slaughtered, is indeed that very childhood innocence, forever destined to suffer that tragic fate at the hands of incipient adulthood.     To a far greater extent than one might imagine, Harper Lee drew much of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD's material from her own life. The lawyerly and reserved father, the small town life (hers was Monroeville, AL), the deceased mother (hers was emotionally distant and psychologically troubled), the scarily unseen neighbor's grown son, the cranky, busybody neighbor, the oddly effete childhood friend - these and numerous other story elements came from Ms. Lee's direct family and childhood experiences. Ms. Lee even borrowed the theme for Jem and Scout's climactic school pageant, \\"Ad Astra Per Aspera,\\" from Kansas's state motto, a little fact she picked up there while assisting Truman Capote with his research for IN COLD BLOOD. I highly recommend as a companion piece to this novel Charles Shields's MOCKINGBIRD: A PORTRAIT OF HARPER LEE.
B00024YVJU|5.0|The music on this album is just stunning! The melodies are lush, deep, evocative, cosmic, shimmering. This is the kind of imaginative, wonderfully bombastic music that will inspire you to throw away your heavy metal guitar and pick up a synth.     Unfortunately, when the vocalist starts to sing, the spell is broken for me. He has such a heavy German accent that I find myself concentrating on \\"what is he saying?\\" A lot of times you can brush off the lyrics of a song, but when the brain hears something 'alien', it tends to focus on that. Possibly it would be better if Eloy had just sung in German (yes they are from Germany.)     At several points in this record the vocalist intones words in the background with a hollow reverb effect that just makes me laugh. It sounds like someone in the audience at a firehall show, coming up to the mic and intoning random phrases (\\"and the gods made love!\\").     Well, after listening to this album several times, I finally got over the distracting vocals and began to really listen to the music. And once again I realized just how great this music is. This is the kind of music a synth player aspires to. Excuse me, time to go practice my synth.

0385424736|5.0|I've read this book four times. It hits on some of the most important questions regarding our legal system, the insurance industry and the irony of most business dealings. Most people rarely mention Grisham's very dry humor. I laughed out loud at many of his characterizations and foolishness our our current legal system. Coppola's movie was okay, but can't compare to this novel.

B000UFAURI|5.0|I don't buy many CDs nowadays and this was my first Foo Fighters CD, but I love it! I find it great to listen to in the car, at home, or even at work. The songs have a great mix of slow and hard to really keep you entertained.
0452289963|5.0|I am surprised by the negative comments about this book.  When I am stressed or having a hard time, something about what Mr. Tolle says brings me such comfort and relief like I can exhale a bit and relax.    I have become so much more aware of my ego, my thoughts and really learned so many insightful things.  If you listen to what he says, you really can live your most profound and fulfilling life just by paying attention to what he has to say and the power is not in what you do but in who you are.  The biggest that I have gotten out of it being to be more accepting of what is going on around me in any moment and that life is always fleeting and not to get all caught up without identifying or giving meaning.  Mr. Tolle writes not to glorify or sell you on her beliefs but to share a way of looking at things.  He doesn't seem to care or mind if you believe them or think he is wrong.  All he wants to share he does and those who it resonates for and those it doesn't then it just isn't the right book for you.  My feeling is that even if a handful of people read this book and walk away awakened then it has been successful.  It's just a warm, loving and necessary book for the times right now.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|Warning!  Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />Before I write about one of my all time favorite shows I should say that when I decided that I wanted all seven seasons of the girls, I looked both at buying the entire series all at once or buying each individual season in the original packaging.  I decided to go with the latter.  This decision was aided by Amazon offering each individual season at only $19.99 a season, making it considerably cheaper than buying the complete series in the collected edition.  But even if I had had to pay a bit more, I would have opted for the individual seasons.  I might have taken a bit longer to get every season, but I would at least have been able to avoid the rather unattractive packaging.  This is actually a problem with a lot of series that you can collect in their entirety in a single package.  Many of them have extremely unappealing containers.  I recently acquired the complete SIX FEET UNDER.  Same deal.  Unattractive box with a bit of faux grass on top of the case.  I want to get the complete NORTHERN EXPOSURE (a show that in many ways resembles THE GILMORE GIRLS), but I've been horrified when I've looked at the ugly backpack containing them.  Are the cases underneath like the original packaging?  If so I can toss the canvas bag.  I just wish the studios would try to do a little better job with the artwork and packaging.<br /><br />THE GILMORE GIRLS lasted seven wonderful seasons (well, five wonderful seasons and then one not so wonderful season, one god awful unbearably painful half season, and a final fairly decent half season).  More as to what went wrong in those final two years below.  It was built around a story of quiet heroism.  Lorelai Gilmore at age 16 finds herself pregnant by her boyfriend Chris.  Rather than succumb to the control of her overweening parents, she leaves home, finds a job as a maid in a Connecticut Inn, and determines to be a single mother.  We join the show 16 years after this event.  Lorelai is no longer a child mother, but a young woman who enjoys a magnificent relationship with her precocious daughter, and has worked her way up to become the manager of the inn that took her in.  We join the show at a moment of crisis.  Rory, Lorelai's daughter, has been admitted to the prestigious private school Chilton, a school integral to Rory's goal to attend Harvard.  But the school tuition is considerably beyond Lorelai's ability to pay.  She therefore makes the reluctant decision to ask her parents for tuition for Rory.  They agree, but only on condition that Rory and Lorelai attend dinner each Friday with Emily and Richard Gilmore.  They want to get to know their granddaughter.<br /><br />This provides a great deal of the narrative of the structure for the show for most of the run of the series.  Sometimes the dinners are more poorly attended.  Sometimes they are not attended at all when one or more of the Gilmore women won't talk to one of the others.  Much of the rest of the show consists of rather mundane things as the main characters live out their lives in Stars Hollow, Hartford, and New Haven, all in Connecticut.  They show does a pretty remarkable job of faking those three east coast towns on the Warner Brothers lot in Hollywood.  Shooting on a section of the lot that adjoins sets upon which shows and movies as diverse as THE MALTESE FALCON, THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK, BLADE RUNNER, THE BIG SLEEP, and PUSHING DAISIES have been made, they do a great job of evoking New England.  (Taking great care to never shoot very far to the right of the hills in the distance from the town square, since to do so would be to reveal the famous HOLLYWOOD sign high on the ridge.)  Having attended Yale, I did cringe in the season were Richard, Emily, and Rory strolled through the Yale campus, which was not only not Yale but not even a college campus, but apparently a public park where they plastered up a sign reading Yale University on a wall.  Later, when Rory sees the light and opts for Yale rather than Harvard, they build some rather impressive Yale sets (though I was always troubled that Rory never went to Sterling Library, which is where the bookish girl would certainly have lurked for four years).<br /><br />But I'm missing the point.  The point is that the show over seven years explores deeply the lives of these people we come to live in their \\"little corner of the world.\\"  I compared THE GILMORE GIRLS and NORTHERN EXPOSURE above.  It is apt.  We get to know Stars Hollow very much the same way that we got to know Cicely, Alaska.  And if the residents of Stars Hollow (excepting Kirk) are not as bizarre as those in Cicely, they are at least more approachable.<br /><br />But regardless of where we are on the show, the finest thing about it is the talk.  There have been other shows that excelled at dialogue.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (which GILMORE GIRLS creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has called her favorite show) had wonderful talk.  And the current ABC series PUSHING DAISIES (which has taken over many of the sets used by THE GILMORE GIRLS -- in one episodes, \\"Bitches,\\" the hero of the show tackles a murderer right in front of the gazebo we all associate with Stars Hollow) has talk that might even exceed THE GILMORE GIRLS in originality.  But no show ever made had so much outstanding talk before.  You can find better dialogue in movies like HIS GIRL FRIDAY (one of the movies Amy S-P cites as a GG inspiration), but it is concentrated in a 90 minute time period.  THE GILMORE GIRLS had great talk thousands and thousands of minutes.  Some complained that the brilliance of the dialogue died in Season Seven, after Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel both quit the show when the WB refused to give them a two-year extension.  But even then I found the talk among the best on TV.<br /><br />One of the greatest things about the characters was that they were not perfect.  Rory is a delightful young girl, but she frequently makes bad decisions about guys.  Lorelai is magnificent, but her love life often sucks, sometimes by her own dumb decisions.  In fact, her sudden break up with Luke at the end of Season Six and her idiot marriage to Chris in early Season Seven (I literally stopped watching the show for several months, asking a friend to tell me if and when Lorelai and Chris broke up -- otherwise I was quitting the show) goes down as one of the dumbest romantic decisions in the history of TV.  And don't blame David Rosenthal, who took over the show when the Palladinos left.  Amy herself had planned the Luke break up and marriage to Chris.  Luckily the show ends on a good romantic note.<br /><br />The acting on the show is magnificent from beginning to end, but I'll focus on just one person.  In my opinion, Lauren Graham is the finest comic actress in the history of TV.  Yeah, I know.  Everyone will say, \\"But what about Lucille Ball.\\"  Lucy was great at slapstick and broad comedy, but not much else.  She certainly wasn't good at drama and she was never asked to engage in the witty banter we associate with Katherine Hepburn in BRINGING UP BABY or Rosalind Russell in HIS GIRL FRIDAY.  Lauren Graham is extraordinary at both.  There is no greater indictment against the Emmys and proof of their ultimate irrelevance than the fact that Lauren Graham, easily the dominant actress of the past decade, never received an Emmy nomination.  There is simply no excuse for this.<br /><br />I've written a lot, but I've barely touched at the astonishing richness of the show.  Many of the major character have barely been hinted at, like Luke (who along with Rory and Lorelai is the third crucial member of the cast) and Lane.  But even if I doubled the size of the review too much would be left out.  Let me just end by saying that this is one of the richest, most delightful American series ever.  Start watching (if you haven't before) and you'll find that you simply don't want it to come to an end.Harvard, they build some rather impressive Yale sets (though I was always troubled that Rory never went to Sterling Library, which is where the bookish girl would certainly have lurked for four years).

B000VNMMQ6|5.0|If you can forgive the incredible story of a character who not only refuses to die but is actually incapable of dying, then this one's for you. Amazing PQ and SQ.
0525950079|3.0|Unfortunately, this book pales in comparison to Pillars of the Earth.  The first book was uplifting and told the story of the great accomplishments of a community.  World Without End, although well written, is simply a long series of stories that are very similar and repetitious.  The main characters constantly fall into the same traps over and over again and either demonstrate unimaginable cruelty or unbelievable and unrealistic altruism.    I couldn't wait to finish it...not because I wanted to find out how the story ended  (it really doesn't end anyway it just sort of peters out) but because I just couldn't take reading the same little stories again and again.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|I think that the prevalent dark scenes caused this movie to be less likeable. Thataside, I still rate this to be very good.
1400034779|3.0|This book took me a little while to get 'into' it but was a good read.  Her dry humor was refreshing! We read this book in our 'Teachers Book Club.\\"
B000U1ZV3U|4.0|Despite previous criticisms, I like this movie in terms of storyline, PQ and SQ. If you can forgive Kevin Costner's bland acting, then this release can be considered collectible.
1594489505|5.0|A thousand splendid stars for this book!  I seldom read books more than once but I HAD to reread this one!!  Makes me so thankful for my life in America.
B000O5B4C4|4.0|The PQ is very good for a 1990's release but I believe could have been better. The visuals is worth the money I paid.
0765357151|4.0|For those who does not bother about editions, covers, special introductions, and so, I think this is definitely a great chance to buy a great book.<br />However, it is still a bit small, which means small letters but handy on the other side.<br />Nice purchase
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|I CAN'T FIND FAULTS WITH THIS RELEASE. ITS SIMPLY AMAZING. CAN ALL FUTURE (CONCERT AND MOVIE)RELEASES BE LIKE THIS?
B000UGG39Q|5.0|I discovered Down very late in the game.  I'm glad I discovered them, period.      In my opinion, this is the best of their three albums.  Phil, throughout the recording, finds that perfect zone that lies between growling and singing, and the songs themselves seem to have an \\"older and wiser\\" maturity about them...  While retaining their swamp-like thickness.    Pick this up if only for the lyrical brilliance of \\"On March the Saints\\" or the pounding epic \\"Pillamyd\\".
B000F9RB94|4.0|I would have rated this as 5 stars if it was released in the unrated version which what my DVD is. Transfer was very good.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Great show and chemistry with all the actors.  You'll get addicted in no time!
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|I would have given a 5 star rating for this product if not for the excessive film grain. If this was intentional on the part of the director or the producer, I believe most people wouldn't like it. One the whole, I still find this to be a very good release.
0452289963|5.0|This book will challenge you.  It will expose you as a dualistic, ego driven being that is asleep... unconscious to their true identity.  It is a fabulous book that will show you a path to deep spirituality and peace in everyday living.<br /><br />It can be a bit painful to face the facts about yourself.  I do not think everyone that reads this book is ready to awaken to the truth.  This is a life changing book.  Don't wait to read it and apply it.  I regret the suffering I caused myself and others through my unconscious actions and ego-driven behavior.  I wish I had this book much earlier.<br /><br />I am an active Mormon that reads the Bible often.  I have read some comments by Christians (and atheists) that find Eckhart Tolle's work as threatening, but I do not see it that way.<br /><br />Instead of tearing down religion, I think if you follow Eckhart Tolle's teachings you will be a better Jew, Catholic, Muslim, Mormon or whatever you are, even an atheist!
B000JVSUS4|5.0|The SQ and PQ is simply amazing. Worth paying and collecting. One of my treasured few.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The Platinum Edition of Snow White has a hidden treat: the theatrical French release of the movie.  It's more than just dialogue and songs dubbed into French; the credits and even artwork in the film are all in French too!  Watch it with the English subtitles turned on for a rather different \\"Snow White\\"!
B00008GKEG|5.0|I read the other reviews first just to get an idea of what i was getting, but after i saw it, i realized that no words can do justice to this awesome piece of history. Theres a lot of important events in world history, world war II, the falling of the berlin wall and the beatles.<br /><br />You will never regret buying this if you are a true fan. If not, you will become one.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I could tell you to just get this album. But, I would then sound like every other flapping douche that has written a review. So, instead, I challenge you. Are you prepared to endure Five Finger Death Punch? Your ears will bleed the sweet, sugary ambrosia delivered by the hot, French maids of the heavens. The extreme pleasure you will feel while listening, caused by the gentle sack squeeze of heavy guitars, is enough to disrupt your nervous system and drop kick you into a celestial orgasmic oblivion. The roaring vocals just may influence you to beat your wife. Once you get even the smallest taste of Five Finger Death Punch, you will never be able to escape the angry, thrusting pelvis of one of today's greatest metal bands. Again, I challenge you. Those who have the courage, rise up and bear the torch. Lead those weaker than you into the labrynth. For without a strong leader such as yourself, those weaker men may never escape the horrible, horrible maze of modern music. The centaur of rap just may feast on their wretched souls.
B000VWYJ8G|1.0|This is definately a film you don't want to watch if you're just in the mood to relax.  As deep as the movie gets is someone is after \\"Jason Bourne\\", and if you are like me who could care less about his character, all of the running around and paranoia are pointless and actually nerve wracking and annoying.  Is this the new generation of movies, about beeping cell phones, video survalence and bombs?  To me, it's not entertaining, all it does is evoke stress and paranoia.  You get that everyday the minute you walk out the door, why would we be entertained and want to spend 2 hours watching some stuck up white boy being chased by the secret mob of whatever, ooh scary, I feel so sorry for you dude. While watching this horrible piece of trash, I wanted to exit the room, light a candle and medidate, that's how much it irritated me. Instead,  I turned this movie off half way through.  I'm not going to get caught up like everyone who likes this movie, I need more substance for my entertainment.  THIS MOVIE WAS LAME!!!!
B000001Y5D|3.0|Linda Perry is obviously a powerful singer-songwriter-instrumentalist, although this interesting little curio from the early '90s is not necessarily the showcase for her.<br />Except for the timeless classic \\"What's Up\\", and the magnetic and melodic \\"Dear Mr. President\\", and the defying-all-description \\"Drifting\\" (with an unidentified instrument - an electric oboe?), we have alot of material that's just a bid difficult to sort out.<br />Perry seems to be a big fan of Heart, Led Zeppelin, and Chrissie Hynde, and on too many tracks we get too big a gulp of such a mix out of the musical blender. Her voice is powerful, but hopelessley lacking in dynamics, save for \\"Drifting\\", where she reaches high for afew notes and provides some relief from the \\"Brass In Pocket\\" sonics.<br />You may find this CD in the \\"Used CD\\" bin - not to promote such practices - but get spellbound by that incredible track - you know the name - look up the track number.<br />Beautiful artwork and booklet.
0156012197|5.0|I am so happy to tell you that this book is awesome. I have read it in three different languages and it is my fave of all books I've read. It touches on the little things in life and lets you see how wonderful the world is when we all take a look from the outside in.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|As a huge fan of Return of the Living Dead (part one) and zombie movies in general, I have to say that part two is fairly entertaining, but not nearly as good as part one.  The recurring roles of the two best (IMHO)characters in the first one definitely make the movie, but it's a little disappointing that they didn't get as much screen time.  Freddy, er, Joey is just as loveable, and Tina, aka Brenda, is much tougher and therefore much more enjoyable to watch.  Frank aka Ed doesn't disappoint either, when it comes to his moaning and whining, but again, his character doesn't get enough depth in this movie.  On top of that, the main characters are an annoying little boy and his stereotypical teenage sister, aided by a teenage cable guy and a crazy old man who seems to be a combination of Burt and Ernie (from Part One, not Sesame St.).  Nobody gets naked, but there's enough blood and gore to render an \\"R\\" rating for this sequel.  While the first movie was meant to be a spoof, it still had enough plot and drama to qualify as a true zombie flick.  Part two, however, is much sillier and cornier, and about the only redeeming aspects of it are the many cameos from the first one, including savvy talking zombies, a gawkish tarman, Frank/Ed and Freddy/Joey, and plenty of brains to go around.  The ending is shockingly positive, unlike part one, and the whole movie leaves many questions to be answered.  Questions like: Why is the transport of dangerous biohazardous material left in the hands of a careless army recruit who can't even tie a decent knot?  How did everybody in town manage to evacuate, except for three households conveniently located on the same street?  And was Michael Jackson less than Thrilled about being spoofed?  All in all, it was a good movie, but not a great one.  If you loved the first one, and want more of the same, then this movie will satisfy your lust for brains.
0393316041|5.0|I loved this book, could hardly put it down, and bought it for several friends. Brilliant and funny, this Nobel laureate penned a delightful memoir. I recommend it for anyone remotely interested in science who wants to get inside a genius's mind. Seldom are we offered such an opportunity.
0452270073|5.0|We have in James Hillman's memorable phrase, 'a terrible love of war'. Living dangerously, at the edge, imminent distaster and probable annihilation excite the deeper drives. Baker's study of hospital records from the first World War (documents few of us would pause to access) have been recast as a fiction that sears all the more for its restraint of rhetorical flourish. Her avoidance of any hysterical note provides the appropriate tone for the accumulated horrors to seep in. By using her protaganist, the voice of novelist Siegfried Sassoon, she can shift her authorial tone to permit Sassoon and fellow 'inmate' Wilfred Owen, to rage poetically against the war's tragic outcomes. However, it's the dilemna of the psychologist, Rivers, treating them, that provides access to the less conspicuous, if no less dramatic consequences of the violence. It is his unenviable task to cure and deliver minds and bodies of young cannon fodder back to the trenches. This is a terrific book, and as we deal now with young veterans returning from their tours of duty be it Baghdad or elsewhere,and encounter the dysfunction from experiencing excessive violence, brutality and injustice, the text of this book should provide some understanding of their stress. Read to the accompaniment of The Pogues awesome take on Eric Bogle's,'And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda' from ,'Rum, Sodomy and the Lash', in turn attributed to that ace warmonger of both catastrophes, old Winston.

B000002KHF|5.0|This CD is currently available used for less than two bucks. If  you don't have it and don't buy it for two lousy bucks, you are a fool. It is the best album from the most gifted singer songwriter of his or any era. If you don't like it, you don't like music.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I'm going to steer clear of reviewing the movie itself, as there are countless professional review sites for which to read up on that.  Not to mention that this is one of the (if not the?) best reviewed movie of its genre.  Let's just say the movie itself is great.     Now, on to the Blu-Ray review.  When I first bought into the Blu-ray format, I told myself that I'd stick to buying the new releases primarily, thinking \\"how good can they really make older movies look without a digital source?\\"  Having said that, I decided to pick up The Shining, mainly because I love the movie and the only other copy I own is the VHS tape.  In one word: WOW.  I don't know if it's because I skipped the SDDVD step and went straight from VHS to Blu-Ray, but it really is like watching the movie for the first time.      The picture is stunningly crisp and detailed-- there are innumerable details that I never saw/noticed in the SD version and the colors and contrast are phenomenal.  The flesh tones are even and consistent and they've really shaken that washed-out look of the previous versions.  I felt like I was \\"inside\\" the Overlook Hotel, and this makes the experience of the film all the more unsettling and terrifying.     There is definitely a bit of noticeable grain here and there.  Whether it's intentional or not (if not, the movie IS almost 30 years old...), it doesn't detract from the awesome hi-def experience of watching one of the most psychologically disturbing movies of all time.  If you're a fan of this movie and own a Blu-ray player, well... you probably already have it.  But if not, there's no time like the present!
B00005JN0T|5.0|We get the usual humor and action of Will smith and a wonderfully represented future world. There seem to be little need for filling in of plot holes. Everything seems to make sense.<br /><br />Aside from the action, few smiling laughs, cool future world and Will Smith half naked, my favorite part of the movie is the general public ignorance of a problem until its too late, as well as corperate cover ups and hidden agendas. Minus the romance, I found a bit of everything I like in this.<br /><br />it's a dangerous thing, creating a mind. Considering our responsibility to that new mind, and it's relationship to us.<br /><br />If you enjoy Robot/Human conflict movies, I might suggest [[ASIN:B00006674T Armitage: Dual-Matrix/Armitage the Third: Poly-Matrix]] .
B000KGGLCU|5.0|As a musician and composer of electronic music since 1977, a former radio show host and as a former community college teacher of electronic music who has critiqued hundreds of pieces of music and performances, I have the proper credentials and expertise to write an objective review of Madonna's most recent release.I am also someone who has danced up a storm on the dance floor of many a club over the years. I am now over 60.<br /><br />Madonna is truly one of the greatest musical performers of all time. And, as stated above, I have seen my share. Prior to viewing her Confessions Tour on TV, I must admit that, with the exception of her performance in Evita, I did not follow Madonna's career in the least. The music she produced was not the genre I typically listen to. But when there is availability on TV, I try to view as much as possible to open myself up to that which I haven't experienced before. I had always been curious about her music but was never motivated enough to actually investigate what she was all about because of all the seemingly salacious relationships and riff raff journalism about her.<br /><br />I was truly pleased by what I viewed. Driving music which is great to dance to, a compelling, undeniably attractive, magnetic personality and very hot body coupled with an exceptional talent for dance and choreography. I truly enjoyed the performance which was abridged for TV. Because of that, and because of the pleasure I had viewing this performance, I decided I wanted to purchase the full length version which also includes production footage which, as a producer myself, I can relate to and enjoy. But this extra footage reveals to the general public the extent of the incredible preparation for a production of this sort.<br /><br />The music itself is most invigorating. The lyrics are profound in many instances, the melodies, rhythms and supporting instrumentation is quite artful and, as a dancer, I have become a real fan of Madonna's music as performed inthis concert as I have taken a deep pleasure dancing along with the music as I view the DVD. It makes me feel as if I were there performing with her. It's major FUN!<br /><br />I look forward to much more creativity and originality from this remarkable personality. BRAVO!!!
B000NY17J6|5.0|I've been a fan of Linda since the 70's. She is the best rocker during that time. Her singing voice is the BEST of all, especially the ballad's. I get goose bumps listening to this CD. A MUST for all her fans. It has all her hit's and more.
B000002IWH|5.0|This soundtrack is simply amazing. It fits the movie to a T. It was one of my very first teenage music purchases and it sort of defined my life at the time and my taste in music for the times to come. My first introduction to NIN, The Cure, Rage... and the final song by Jane Siberry is so sad and beautiful. I only saw the movie once (though I own it), but I have listened to the soundtrack countless times over the years. This album really helped me and I am so grateful for it.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Can't say much about the product itself, the item and brand speak for themselves. This seller offered the product at an excellent price, and I received it very quick. Quite possibly one of the best, most hassle free and painless on line purchases I've made. I recommend this seller.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Its so hard to choose a favorite amongst the 3 movie soundtracks. They are all so wonderful and differnent. Each film has its own distinct music and they are all so good. Its impossible to pick a favorite or even find one single piece of music that I did not like. Its such a moving and powerful soundtrack. And every time I hear it, I think back on the wonderful film and remember every single scene that the piece of music was attached too. Its relaxing and melancholy and sublime. The Return of the King is my favorite film out of the 3, and I think I am leaning towards this soundtrack as my personal favorite as well. And I love Annie Lenox's last song on this. It is so touching and powerful, it gives me chills every time I hear it.  I actually have the 3 set as one boxed set, but could not find it on Amazon anymore, so I am reviewing them all individually.
B001041JLE|1.0|This is simply a tarted up rehashing.  This crud tells me \\"DISCO STILL SUCKS\\" and MJ needs to give it up.   He made so many promises that he didn't keep.  What about how he was going to help the Hurricane Katrina victims?  This guy was OVER years ago. Only a fool would continue to support someone who has abused children the way this creep has.
B000BNI90O|5.0|You can't but appreciate this soundtrack. The tone of the music varies greatly from composition to composition. It is serene and ethereal, then fast and powerful. Enya's 'May It Be' is magical and just a stunning piece of music. It fits so well with this film. The complete recordings are so worth the extra money, because you will treasure this soundtrack for years to come. I want my kids to be able to listen to them (when I actually have kids). Its just a wonderful soundtrack to a wonderful film.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|In a world where everything is created for compressed audio /MP3 files and the  tiny speakers/ipod generation, it was a pleasure to listen to the re mastered Joshua Tree and  appreciate the depth of this recording.  20 years later this is still one of  my all time favourite recordings  and  the bonus material only reminded me more of the era  I would like to return to.
B00005B73G|4.0|This movie came out of nowhere for me. A late night viewing that turned into one of the most heart-breaking and touching films I've ever seen. John Hurt plays the 'elephant man', a human with such a deformation that people litereally scream upon viewing him. And yet, his nature is so tender and humble. Its such a wonderul role that I literally had to cry. Anothony Hopkins, as the man who be-friended and helped John Hurt gives a subtle, yet perfect performance. You can tell he really cared. Filmed entirely in an almost grainy black and white, you would never know this is a somewhat modern film unless you were familiar with the actors. But don't let that deter you. You really barely notice it once you're engaged with the story. And what a depressing story it is. I was wide awake at 2 in the morning completely in tears from this film. It should not be missed. My only dissapointment is that I do not see a Region 1 DVD on Amazon. What gives?
B0012HCASA|1.0|I downloaded the free pilot and didn't care much for it.  I even watched another couple of episodes since the writers strike is stil going strong and there is not much else on.  I really like sci-fi, but I just couldn't get into this show.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I love how this soundtrack is different from the first film's, yet, you can definietely tell that they are part of the same film. It flows so well. The music ranges from soothing to dark and powerful. Its a wonderful CD to listen to. I love 'Gollum's Song'. Its so dark and spooky sounding. Its a great way to end the CD. If you love the movie, you must get the CD.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The music may not always be a perfect studio production, but the mood of this CD is delightful and makes it one of my favorite purchases of the year.  I find myself chanting \\"I am a vampire, I am a vampire,\\" all day long at work, though in real life, I am not a vampire at all.  All of the songs have a pleasant folk feel.  They compel me to strain to learn the words as fast as I can to sing along, but in a good way.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|I hate the romantic comedy genre, but I adore French Kiss. I think it has something to do with Kevin Kline. He was so good in this. He comes off as somewhat sleazy at first, but you really do end up liking him towards the end. Meg Ryan is Meg Ryan, nothing new or different there. It has a great storyline and good direction. Its thoroughly enjoyable and doesn't really have any dull moments. Its subtly funny and has just the right amount of romance and intrigue. One of the only romantic comedies I will ever recommend.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I'm not a die hard jamiroquai fan. I own 3 Jamiroquai albums. And I should say it's a great CD to have if you want all the radio hits. This is what you need in your car or your trip. Although Virtual Insanity isn't the album's long version, everything else is perfect. No Jay Kay or the band's photo in the booklet if you're looking forward for some pictures.
6305308659|4.0|Pleasantville is simply an intriguing and innovative movie. It really is a rarity to showcase a movie such as this. And what a novel concept. At first glance, I wasn't sure if I would be interested in modern film purposely filmed in black and white. I thought it would feel odd. But it didn't. It worked so well that I loved it immedietely. The characters are all great and interesting. The plot is also great and intriguing. And its also sweet and tender as well as being serious and comedic, all in the span of 2 hours. I can't get enough of this film, its one of those that I can watch over and over again and it seems new at every viewing.
B000002BSG|5.0|How many radio hits can this CDs have!? You'd be amazed by the complexity of the songs and the talents that musicians have. No need to say virtual insanity is the song that made them popular, won grammy and all that. Other songs like Alright and Cosmic Girls fans favorites. I like the last hidden song in this album. This album also features songs like Traveling without Moving and High Times. The entire album sounds like you're traveling in outer space! So sit tight and enjoy this magical ride. :)
B00003CXSM|1.0|This, for me, is one of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen. Its so mundane and unoriginal and completely not funny. Jennifer Lopez is a one character actor. Honestly. There is no range with her. People pay money to see her films, but really, they are just watching the same movie over and over again. Everyone who watches this movie will know what will happen at the end. Its a given. There is no need for obstacles or pointless drama. Romantic comedies are *almost* all the same. Same characters, same ending. However, what makes this one even more unbearable is the fact that once again, Jennifer Lopez is in it. Even Matt Mcconaughey can't salvage this.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|...is genius. And that fact that he was only 19(?) when he composed this, is merely, nearly unbeweavable.    I love the trumpets.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|When this came out, it was unique. I'd never seen anything like it. It was basically a film and filming a TV show. It sounded weird and almost Sci-fiish, but it was none of those things. It was actually a really good movie. Jim Carrey is perfect in this. It gives him the chance to really shine as an actor, combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extrememly likable character. Its his best role, in my opinion. And, honestly, he is the reason to see this film because I don't think it would be as interesting with another actor. I really liked the soundtrack to this film as well, it was very moving at times. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job. The utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting. Its a great and differnt type of film that should be seen by all. It never strays too much in the goofiness arena, and is always endearing and believable.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I love her voice it doesn't make you wanna go out and punch someone.<br />To me it's very relaxing music it helps me think of life in a more positive way.<br />Instead of hating the world all the time, and it doesn't only talk about sex.<br />I think she is a very pretty women, and just think I'm Italian/Irish and I don't have a problem with the color of her skin or her race cause she's of the human race.<br />Any way this album is a very worthyful album to buy, oh yeah I'm a BIG jazz liker too.LOL<br />I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|Not a blockbuster (for those of you who like that sort of thing), but a nice add to the collection.  The movie is very good and will mimic most of our own spiritual journeys (in one form or another).  Easy to relate to and a good story line that connects well with our own spirituality.  This movie inspired me to go back and review the original book again.  I forgot how cool it was.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|Cult films don't come much more groundbreaking than \\"Dark City\\" -- it was bending reality before the Matrix ever did.<br /><br />At first glance, Alex Proyas' movie seems like a basic sci-fi little-man-against-evil-aliens flick. But it isn't. Instead, it's a dark grimy nightmare where nothing is what it seems, and everything we think is real is just an elaborate illusion. This is one of the rare films that is creepy from start to finish.<br /><br />The Strangers are pasty-faced, bald, leather-coat-wearing aliens (think Darth Vader, post-mask), whose survival depends on somehow imitating human souls and dreams. So they created the Dark City, to observe and manipulate the unwitting humans.<br /><br />Our hero John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a tub, with no memory of who he is, and the police hunting him for brutal murders that he is sure he didn't commit. And worse, hes being pursued by the Strangers, without even knowing who they are or why they're after him.<br /><br />And then he starts seeing past the Strangers' illusions. Buildings are reshaped, people's memories change, and the sun never appears. As John searches for hints to his past, he finds that the places he knew never existed -- and it's connected to the Strangers. Now John and a suspicious cop will unravel the truth of the City -- and of why the Strangers want John.<br /><br />It's not surprising that \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Dark City\\" are often compared. They deal with an illusionary \\"real\\" world, malevolent manipulation, and one man who might be able to stop the bad guys. But \\"Dark City\\" is very much unique -- it's dark, angular, and haunted, like if Fritz Lang made a sci-fi noir.<br /><br />The Dark City is a pretty creepy place, like a... well, like a city at night, with some surreal skyscrapers, big cogs and giant clocks. Proyas gives all these scenes a creepy feeling, which is only increased by the fact that there are so few people in the streets and houses. Even everyday things like eating soup and going to work become unreal.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy. All the dialogue is well written (\\"You know something, I don't think the sun even... exists... in this place\\"), and very spare. But Proyas makes all the dialogue weirdly disconnected, as if the characters are never really communicating fully. It adds to the dreamlike feeling.<br /><br />Sewell is well-suited to the role of John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers. Connelly has a good if underused role as his nightclub-singer wife. Kiefer Sutherland is a bit annoying, but he does a good Peter Lorre impersonation with all those nervous gasps.<br /><br />Like Kafka on acid, \\"Dark City\\" is a unique and compelling sci-fi movie, with outstanding direction and an amazing plot. Definitely a must-see.oup and going to work become unreal.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy.

B00133KFGW|5.0|February 13, 2008    I really enjoyed this movie a lot.  It was just a great movie that comes along once in a while.  I couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD so I went to the movies and saw the it the day before Thanksgiving Day in 2007. Very good movie. JB of Joliet, IL.
B000W4KT64|5.0|Hairspray is an excellent movie for all ages.  The singing and dancing are wonderful not to mention John Travolta as Mrs. Turnblat.  The kind of movie you want to own so you can watch it as many times a you want.  Family entertainment all the way.
B00000IQC8|1.0|I thought this was supposed to be funny?  The film 'Clerks' was completely underwhelming.  Maybe if I had worked in a convenience store in Jersey in the early 1990s, I'd find it to be even slightly amusing...but I didn't...so I don't.
B00005JMCW|3.0|It was funny but I've seen it before     Her brother (Ape Face) is a pain I have two younger brothers and they're evil so I know how Lindsay Lohan feels. This story about a daughter and a mother switching places this is the funniest story ever and how do they switch places just by a fortune cookie? The book was amazing as was the movie. The movie was very good but not my type of movie I'm more of a action/horror type of guy. I think movies from books ruin what the autor writes in his/her books then everybody just goes to see the movie instead of reading the book first. But all in all it was a pretty good book that everyone of every age I think would enjoy to read and see the movie.
B000GRUS22|5.0|My wife gave me this for Valentine's Day a little bit ago. As I was entering into ITunes I listened. I have yet to be disappointed by any of his works. We find that Enigma is the 'sexiest' of the CDs and use it for background mood music sometimes. You can not go wrong with this as a choice, especially if it is a gift for someone special.[[ASIN:B000GRUS22 A Posteriori]]
B000TGCR3S|3.0|overall its a good buy, even better when its on promotion   the story goes abit out of hand @ the last quarter of the movie, i guess a re watch is needed to understand better
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I remember those 70's drive-in movies and<br />Quentin Tarantino did a great job at making<br />a horrible movie.<br />I kept wanting to fast forward to<br />the good parts, but then found out that the<br />only good part was stunt-woman Zoe Bell riding<br />the hood of the car.<br />Now if we were only charged $1.50 and could sneak<br />in a couple freinds in the truck of the car, well<br />then this may just be worth ZOE BELL riding that<br />hood (over and over and over and over again.)<br />Otherwise, it's not!<br />This makes 'Death Race 2000' look like a Oscar worthy film.

They said the item arrived somewhere on the East Coast and was damaged, that's it, no help. I notified Amazon and they had a new one shipped the very same day. When received, the product was perfect.

074356619X|5.0|\\"The secret\\" tapes have been most helpful to me and my friends. I am usually not into self help tapes and books and feel that reading a good piece of literature does more good to improve one's mind and attitude than reading or listening to some boring \\"how to\\" book or tape. But this tape is different. Applying the principals is life altering at best and mood enhancing at worst. You win either way!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What a great job in writing the story and producing the animation! All the details were taken care of in great fashion, and the story was very touching and interesting. It definitely made me want to cook as well!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I generally despise all Beatles remakes because I have never heard anything that came close to capturing the emotion of the original. This soundtrack is WONDERFULLY DONE!!! I have watched the movie so many times since I got it a week ago. If you are thinking about buying or downloading this soundtrack, you should definitely get the 31 track edition. One of my favorite songs and one of the best dance sequences was \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and the other versions don't include it or \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\". This is a MUST BUY for any Beatles fan, young or old.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I watch this movie purely by accident. I liked the movie a lot and the Music
B000GCFO0S|4.0|This Blu-ray movie was worth the $14.  It has decent video quality (not the best, but acceptable) and good sound quality.  If you already own the DVD then an upconverter will probably be close to this Blu-ray copy.  The movie is one of the better video game adaptations that has been made.  Not quite near the quality of Resident Evil in my opinion, but this is still a very enjoyable movie.  I gave this Blu-ray 4 stars out of 5 because the story, aduio, and picture quality were very good as a whole.  Very happy with this purchase.
B000060OFT|4.0|It must have taken courage to put Romeo and Juliet together circa 2000, 400 years after its first appearance, 3000 miles away from the Globe Theater. Set in a war ravaged inner city dispute which has now spanned two continents in that time frame,the film literally bombards the viewer with a volatile, electric pace, then gradually allows DiCaprio and Danes to take over \\"their\\" picture.Their love scenes are appropriate and well done,an obvious necessity beacause of Shakespeare's \\"old english\\" which in essence turns the production into a foreign film without captions.In this regard, any inappropriate cinemagraphic slipups  would have likely distracted the viewer.None are apparent to this reviewer. But, as I've always argued, the play/film really doesn't concern itself with \\"star crossed\\" lovers, Rather,it concerns itself with interfered lovers, the type Janis Ian brilliantly sang about in \\"Society\\"s Child\\" circa 1965.Real people cause the tragedies here, especially the ultimate debacle, not a misalignment in the heavens. Whatever, it's a good, not great film, one worth multiple viewings.
0805079831|5.0|This is a must read for our generation. Klein's research and ability to dissect the neoliberal economic movement to its very core is outstanding. I hope that more people read this book and feel the same shock and anger I did. May this book become the catalyst needed for a movement that will change something that is very sick in our society today.
0810993139|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Very amusing (I laughed out loud several times) and irreverant enough to suit even the most disaffected middle-schooler.    One of the things I liked about it is that there was no comeuppance at the end.  There is not even a hint of the After School Special in this book, nor its sequel.  That's unusual enough in a children's book to be notable.    Greg is not the most upstanding or admirable character, it's true -- but he's fun and funny.

B00008S2VG|5.0|American life is the best, cohesive album of Madonna. Although i am not a particular great fan of her earlier work, after listening to this album, it somehow made me discover some earlier gems on ray of light, erotica and music.  But American Life stands out.
B0000085N4|4.0|I just recently purchased this cd along with Love and Electric.  I have to say this is the catchiest of the 3.  Astbury's voice is borderling ridiculous (over the top), but I don't see that as a bad thing at all.  Songs like Fire Woman and American Horse have been stuck in my head ever since I heard them.  Some people like put down this album for being \\"commercialized\\" in order to sound sophisticated, but I don't really agree with that.  Sometimes music has to be taken at face value; The Cult didn't write deep lyrics for the most part.  Duffy's guitar riffs are something to be admired, made me pick up my guitar and learn them.  Overall I think this CD is a must for any rock fan period.
B00110K62U|5.0|This show oringinated in France and was transferred to London's West End and completely rewritten for the English/American audience (the French version was even bleaker!).  It opened at London's Barbican Theatre on October 8, 1985 for a limited season but found a home at the Palace Theatre on December 4, 1985 and on April 3, 2004 transferred to the Queen's Theatre just down the road and is still playing today.  It opened on Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on May 12, 1987 and ran until May 18, 2003 for 6680 performances.    This show launched many West End and Broadway careers.  To celebrate the 10th anniversary of its West End opening, producer Cameron Macintosh gathered cast members from London, New York and Austrailia to perform the show in concert at the Royal Albert Hall.    This production was overpoduced like all of Cameron's shows but for a concert performance it was perfect.  London and Broadway's Colm Wilkinson leads the cast as Jean Valjean. London favorite Michael Ball, Austialia's Philip Quast and Broadway favorite Judy Kuhn join the show with Miss Saigon star Lea Solanga rounding out the cast.    The encore has 17 different Valjeans together to sing \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" in each performer's native language.    For fans of the show, this will probably be the only filmed version of the show, unless Rob Marshall gets the itch to direct a movie of the show.    The only thing that at a $35 list price, it is way too expensive.  I'll wait until it is a little more reasonable.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album changed my life, plain and simple.  All of the songs on this monster of an album are great.  Believe the hype, this is one of the last great classic rock albums ever made.

B00006LLNU|1.0|I became interested in Sigur Ros () after finding a YouTube video segment of a live performance of Track 7.  I wish that I had not spent money on this album.    The first few tracks really set the tone for the album.  Music for mosquitos, with Asian influences.  As is noted by other reviewers, the lead singer repeats a nonsense word/phrase over and over, throughout the album.  The music is conventional and droning.  The first tracks contain something that is very reminiscent of a mosquito buzzing my ear while I try to sleep.  This has more in common with jazz than rock, more like what a rock band might do if they had to fill an hour jam session with atmospheric stuff.    This isn't electronic, its too annoying to be ambient, and has too much conventional rock to be \\"post-rock.\\"  I recommend Debussy's Jeaux, and Jean-Michel Jarre's Zoolook to this.  (Right now I'm listening to Corsican Chant to get this out of my head.)
B000AP04MO|5.0|A swinging 60s version of Scenes from a Marriage. Director Stanley Donen whips up a masterful cinematic soufflé here, folding in a sophisticated script by Frederick Raphael, a generous helping of Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn, and topping it all off with a real cherry of a score by the great Henry Mancini. Donen follows the travails of a married couple over the years of their relationship, by constructing a series of non-linear flashbacks and flash-forwards (a structural device that has been utilized since by other filmmakers, but rarely as effectively).  While ostensibly a \\"romantic comedy\\", Two For the Road is, at its heart, a thoughtful meditation on the nature of love and true commitment. Finney and Hepburn have great on-screen chemistry (and both were at the peak of their physical beauty-which doesn't hurt). Colorful European locales provide additional icing on the cake. This is one of those films (like The Way We Were) that some people form an emotional bond with.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This is a wonderfully made film, one of those well-crafted pieces where every frame could be a painting.  The performances were fantastic and as someone who has never read a Jane Austen book or seen a Jane Austen film adaptation (unless you count \\"[[ASIN:B0009W5IP6 Clueless (Special Whatever! Edition)]]\\") I was very new to this world.  And I liked it!  The ending of the movie is what really got me, that and the score.  The piano score was perfectly lovely, and I may have to buy it on CD.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD don't add much of anything.  Director Joe Wright's commentary is dull as dishwater and the interviews with the cast are repeated on different special featurettes to the point where you benefit the most from watching only one of them.  But overall, if you somehow missed this gem, I suggest renting it and catching up because it's well worth your time!
B000Y7U98C|2.0|For his sci-fi thriller \\"Sunshine\\", director Danny Boyle teams up again with writer Alex Garland, who provided the screenplays for both 28 Days Later and its sequel (Garland also penned the original novel that inspired Boyle's film \\"The Beach\\").    Ostensibly about a team of astronauts on a mission to salvage the dying Sun and save the Earth, \\"Sunshine\\" ambitiously aims to take its protagonists on a Homeric journey, by way of Tartovsky (\\"Solaris \\") and Kubrick (\\"2001 - A Space Odyssey\\"). Unfortunately, after a fairly successful liftoff, the film quickly veers off course and loses its trajectory.    The story is set in 2057, when the Sun is suffering from a condition that, as near as I was able to tell from the rather sketchy scientific exposition, is akin to some type of solar constipation. There's something blocking the star's ability to generate its own nuclear fusion...uh, I think. Well, whatever \\"it\\" is, there ain't no sunshine when it's gone...okay?    Anyway, the highly specialized 8-member crew of \\"Icarus II\\" is mankind's last hope (the crew of \\"Icarus I\\" apparently stopped sending postcards some months back). It is up to them to launch and detonate a powerful bomb that will presumably jump-start the Sun back into its preferred central heating mode for our solar system.    I know what you're thinking-sounds a tad familiar? Yes, it is pretty much a glorified rehash of \\"Armageddon\\". Well, \\"Armageddon\\" for philosophy majors. Because, you see, things get \\"deep\\" between the requisite scenes of stuff blowing up real good. There's an awful lot of brooding and gnashing of teeth going on amongst the crew members once they set the controls for the heart of the sun. It is also implied that there are metaphysical conundrums afoot, but the screenplay fails to extrapolate on the significance. By the time the third act disintegrates into a cheesy \\"Alien\\" rip-off, you probably won't care anyway.    Boyle regular Cillian Murphy stars as the brooder-in-chief, the crew's egghead physicist, `Robert Capa' (I've racked my mind over that one...why is a fictional nuclear physicist named after a famous war photographer? I invite your speculation. These are the types of things that keep me awake at night, folks.) To his credit, Murphy maintains a compelling presence, even though you suspect that he doesn't have much more of a clue about what is going on in this film than the viewer does. Michelle Yeoh does an earnest turn as `Corazon' a biologist who nurtures the onboard green houses, reminiscent of Bruce Dern in \\"Silent Running\\"(hmm...if Capa is the ship's Brain, then I assume she is the Heart?)    Some have hailed this as a masterpiece. I am not one of them. Granted, it is handsomely mounted, with some nice set designs and impressive special effect work; but it lacks a cohesive story. It's like someone reached into a hat full of interesting ideas, threw the scraps of paper up in the air, and just let them blow about the room while trying to follow them with a camera. For a story that flies so close to the Sun, \\"Sunshine\\" left me cold.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|My kids loved it, I thought the plot line was slow as heck.  If you compare this movie to something like cars then I feel you will be disappointed.  It just wasn't the same quality.  It seemed it should have been about 30 mintues shorter.  It wasn't bad and the kids will like it, but i felt it needed something more to please adults.
B000WZAE1I|3.0|Director Matthew Vaughn has tackled something completely different here for his second directorial effort (the follow-up to his auspicious 2004 debut, the Tarantino-influenced Brit Noir \\"Layer Cake\\").  The result is a pleasant (albeit fluffy) surprise.    Co-scripted by the director along with Jane Goldman, and based on the Neil Gaiman novel, \\"Stardust\\" is a tale set in a mythical, sleepy little hamlet called Wall, which lies at the border between England and a \\"magic kingdom\\" called Stormhold, demarcated only by a stone wall. Just one solitary, wheezing relic of a man stands guard over a gaping, woefully under-maintained breach (hmmm, border security issues, crumbling infrastructure, people working well past retirement age...are we sure this is a `fantasy'?).    Enter our hero, Tristan (Charlie Cox), a bumbling \\"shop boy\\" who is hopelessly smitten by a shallow but popular local beauty named Victoria (Sienna Miller). After the couple witness a falling star one evening, Tristan vows to cross over the wall into the \\"forbidden\\" Stormhold to retrieve it for her, in order to prove his undying devotion (I'll bet he says that to all the girls). Victoria gives him her bemused blessing and sends him on his merry way. Needless to say, he handily breezes past the \\"border patrol\\".    Much to his chagrin, Tristan discovers he isn't the only one lusting after that star power. Michelle Pfeiffer has a grand old time chomping scenery as an evil witch (there always has to be an evil witch, it's a rule) who is racing the squabbling sons of a dying king (Peter O'Toole) to retrieve the star, each for their own nefarious reasons. Complicating things further is the fact that the \\"star\\" (an appropriately luminescent Clare Danes) has taken corporeal form, and would prefer not to take part in anyone's \\"plans\\" for her, thank you very much. Madcap adventures (and the tricky travails of True Love) ensue.    OK-I have to mention the cross-dressing pirate. Robert De Niro threatens to steal the show in his relatively limited screen time as the barely closeted Captain Shakespeare. Ricky Gervais (\\"Extras\\") is another highlight, making the most of his cameo as the slippery wheeler-dealer, Ferdy the Fence.    The film may not boast the sharpest script, but the gags that do work, work quite well. For instance, the king of Stormhold's numerous sons are named according to birth order-Primus, Secundus, Tertius, Quartus, etc.; for some inexplicable reason I couldn't stop laughing at that (perhaps it recalls the classic \\"Biccus Diccus\\" gag from \\"Life of Brian\\".)    If there is one potentially fatal flaw in the film, it lies in the casting of its leading man, Charlie Cox. While he appears to be an earnest young actor, the poor boy just doesn't ooze much charisma (perhaps young women would beg to differ with me; or maybe he just tests well with focus groups?). Let's just say, he's no Errol Flynn. Luckily, his lackluster presence is somewhat compensated by the star power on hand (O'Toole, Pfeiffer and De Niro) and the genuinely winning turn from Clare Danes.    There seems to be a number of reviewers out there slagging this off as a \\"Princess Bride\\" wannabe, but you know what? That's just lazy criticism. I went into the theatre, determined NOT to have that expectation rolling around in my head, and I found this to be quite charming and entertaining on its own terms, in a wantonly goofy \\"...forget your troubles c'mon get happy\\" kind of way. Sometimes, that's all you require from a movie.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I just love this movie - and so do my kids.  The movie has a great plot line and one that is not too complex for little ones.  The animation is great, colors are vivid.  The voices of the stars go with the charcters.  I just love Larry the Cable Guy as Mater - great act.    Wonderful viewing - people of all ages will enjoy this one.
B00005NVDF|5.0|I don't know what it is about this particular Woody Allen vehicle, but no matter how many times I have viewed it over the years, I laugh just as hard at all the one-liners as I did the first time I saw it.  Annie Hall and Manhattan may be his most  highly lauded and artistically accomplished films, but for pure \\"laughs per minute\\", I would nominate this 1972 entry, with a screenplay adapted by Allen from his own original stage version. Ironically, it's the only \\"Woody Allen film\\" that wasn't directed by him (those chores went to Herbert Ross). Allen portrays a film buff who is particularly obsessed with Humphrey Bogart. He fantasizes conversations with Bogie's ghost (played to perfection by Jerry Lacy) who advises him on how to \\"be a man\\" and attract the perfect mate. He receives more pragmatic assistance from his best friends, a married couple (Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts) who fix him up with a series of women (the depictions of the various dating disasters are hilarious beyond description). A true comedy classic.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this movie, and I was confident I was going to love it. Sex and nudity scenes are never shocking. As a matter of fact very good taste, I understand the director just wants to show nude reality, and nude actors are part of the show. It is ridiculous in other movies, people go to bed, and suddenly it is breakfast. Shortbus shows everything, non stop, and we pay so much more attention to the conflicts within each character, that we simply forget the actors are nude, having sex, or whatever.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|There is a key scene in Ridley Scott's riveting crime epic \\"American Gangster\\" that speaks volumes about the personal code that drives one of the film's principal characters. \\"Look at the way you're dressed,\\" says the impeccably groomed and tastefully attired 1970s Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in disgust, to his ostentatiously pimped-out brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), \\"...it's a look that says: `arrest me'. Remember, the loudest one in the room is also the weakest one in the room.\\"     It's one of the axioms Lucas picked up while paying his dues working as a driver for his mentor, an old-school Harlem crime lord (Clarence Williams III). By the time his boss keels over from a heart attack, Lucas has been thoroughly schooled in the shrewd business acumen of how to remain a \\"wolf in sheep's clothing\\"; no matter how venal your methods are for getting to the top and maintaining your position, if you're able to swing it while maintaining a respectable public appearance, everybody will still love you.    Scott's film is all about \\"appearances\\"; judging a book by its cover, if you will. When we are first introduced to the film's other main character, New Jersey police detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), we're not sure if we're observing a cop and his partner serving a warrant, or if we're watching a disheveled street thug and his pal pulling a B & E on someone's apartment. While his personal grooming habits may be questionable, it is apparent that his integrity is of the highest order. He is an honest cop in a department that is swimming in corruption (he's sneered at as a \\"boy scout\\" when he turns in nearly one million dollars in cash discovered in a dealer's car).    Lucas, on the other hand, maintains the outward appearance of an upstanding citizen. He has prospered via an ingenious Southeast Asian heroin pipeline that bypasses any pesky \\"middlemen\\". He buys an estate in the suburbs and sets up house for his brothers and his mother (playedby the great Ruby Dee, who we don't see enough of these days). He marries a beautiful Latina (Lymari Nadal) and ingratiates himself as a pillar of the community.    Steven Zailian's screenplay is based on true events; the story takes place in the same seedy 70s N.Y.C. milieu that inspired films like \\"The French Connection\\", \\"Serpico\\" and \\"Prince of the City\\". There are numerous references made to the real-life French connection case, as well as the police corruption that was depicted the latter two films.     Scott uses a trick that worked well for Michael Mann in the similarly structured \\"Heat\\".  He builds a considerable amount of dramatic tension by keeping his two powerhouse stars apart for the lion's share of the film, while steadily teasing on the inevitability that the two men's professional paths are destined to cross. When Washington and Crowe finally do share a scene together, it proves to be well worth the wait (when you see it, watch closely for the coffee cup prop that becomes a proxy chess piece; it's a masterstroke of gesture from both actors).     Scott utilizes his patented ultra-slick visual style, although a grittier look might have served the story better. Despite the deliberate pacing for the first 2 hours, something about  the denouement feels curiously rushed (sorry, can't elaborate-potential spoiler!) The performances by Washington and Crowe are superb, with a nice turn as well from Josh Brolin as a corrupt Special Investigations Unit cop, and Armand Assante as a mob big shot. I liked the period soundtrack as well, although we need to declare a moratorium on Bobby Womack's \\"Across 110th Street\\". It's a great song, but it's now been used in three films!
B000TGCR3I|5.0|When I first saw the cover of the case, I thought this would be a boring, childish anime movie.  Yet, when I watched it, I was pleasantly surprised.  When it comes to anime movies, I tend to like those visually stunning movies from directors like Satoshi Kon, etc.  I must say that this movie took Taiyo Matsumoto's style and made it consistent throughout the whole movie.  At first, I was a little lost with where this was going to go.  Then after you get involved in the movie to a certain point, you find every moment interesting, amazing, and/or breathtaking.  I felt that the story for this movie was random at points, yet still great to watch unfold.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone out there into anime that isn't afraid of a non-mainstream style movie.  If you're looking for something more Miyazaki-esque, then I suggest you don't watch this.
B0002I831S|5.0|The original \\"Star Trek\\".  Yum.  Good science fiction and good, campy fun. These episodes from the first season have the added bonus of being just a little more wobbly and unsure of themselves than the next two years, where the show's rhythm had been found. The performances are both less assured and a little more serious (the \\"Trek\\" crew dove heavily into the inside humor in the later episodes) but the entertainment value remains unparalleled after all these decades. I picked these up just to have a failsafe entertainment option on nights when regular TV falls flat... and boy, are they great!  The show is even funnier and more delicious than I remembered from when I was a kid... Great stuff; highly recommended!<br /><br />(PS - but why are the episodes presented out of order? Seems rather odd...) (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)
0439813786|5.0|I was anxious to complete this great story.It is trully a masterpiece, that intertwines so many experiences of this young orphan boy. The sketching illustrations are wonderfully interwoven that was a delight to look for intricate details.
0143038583|5.0|This book is very informative about our nation's food supply and makes a great case for organics. If you are interested in food and it's origins,this book is entertaining and yet very thought provoking. I'm usually a novels person, I must must say, this book has me thinking very time I go to the grocery store!
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|This soundtrack, like the movie, is erratic, diverse and mostly successful, often great.  The best cuts are those where the performers take the Dylan material as a starting point and bring their own styles and sensibilities to it.  The weakest are those where Dylan is approached on tiptoe, as if crawling too close to a deity, as if simply to sing a version of one of his songs is an audacity, and the result of that approach is just a pale copy of the original.    One other overall random thought -- what a great day it was when Dylan first plugged in.  So many of these songs work as rock, electrifying them made (and makes) them all the more original and outrageous.    Best cuts:  Sonic Youth's I'm Not There; Goin to Acapulco (don't much care for My Morning Jacket, but Jim James is fine here and everything Calexico does on the CD is arresting); Stuck Inside of Mobile (Cat Power snotty and sensuous at the same time, a nice trick); John Doe on Pressing On and I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine (and check out his latest CD, A Year in the Wilderness);  Highway 61 from Karen O, truly revisited; Los Lobos taking Billy south of the border; Can't Leave Her Behind; Yo La Tengo's I Wanna Be Your Lover; the Once couple on You Ain't Goin Nowhere; Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window, Hold Steady at their best on one of Dylan's great under-known songs; Maggie's Farm, more because of the Million Dollar Bashers than Malkmus' vocals; Moonshiner; and Antony and the Johnsons glorious dirge take on Knockin' On Heaven's Door.    Less successful (see the too cautious comment above): Tombstone Blues (though to be fair, Havens' singing really works in the film); Dark Eyes; Senor (yes, I know Willie's a god, but he's also boring here); Ring Them Bells; and -- especially -- two standards, Just Like a Woman and The Times They Are a Changin' .
0740748475|5.0|This colection has a very good paper and pretty colors. The book is very heavy (be careful or you might torn the 2nd paper cover, as I did) but is a fine piece to have in the shelf. I recommend to whom like Calvin and Hobbes.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome.  I am not a huge Celine Dion fan, but I saw this DVD at a friends house and I ran home to order it.  The entire production is just breathtaking.  It's even better than being there!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I won't comment on it's content as I don't watch this show...I bought all three seasons as a Christmas gift for my son. He became a fan of Lost when he went away to college so I thought it would make for a good time in their dorm room, they now have \\"Lost Night\\" once a week. It is packaged very well and doesn't take up a lot of space with unneeded bulk. It was less expensive at Amazon than anywhere I could find locally. They shipped it for free and it was packaged perfectly, blister-packed to a hard piece of cardboard in a cushioned box...nice touch.
0618918248|3.0|We Brits always run the risk of unthinkingly following tradition, and I wonder if that's not the case here. Bashing religion has been a well-established tradition in England for close to a century and a half. I think the author does it well, as well as can be expected. One could wish, though, that he had exceeded, or challenged our expectations. Is bashing the church still the best strategy for pursuing the scientific study of human origins?<br /><br />The problem, of course, is natural selection. While the scientific establishment embraces it, while it remains the shiboleth by which right-thinking atheists everywhere recognize each other, there can be no advance in the study of origins.<br /><br />In natural selection and the physicalism it endorses science encounters self-contradiction. The choosing between alternative hypotheses basic to science implies that reason, at least, is not bound by physical determinism. If reason isn't, then our other faculties can't logically be bound by it either. And if these faculties evolved, free of physical determinism, what does that imply about the process of evolution itself?<br /><br />Young Brits are here faced with the unnerving prospect of virgin territory. What assumptions would you start with, in rethinking evolution, if you believed it could create an un-determined human self? I think I see a new tradition emerging.
1594481717|5.0|In A Whole New Mind Daniel H. Pink prepares us for a new kind of society. He tells us that the world market is moving out of linear thinking and into more creative thinking. He breaks the brain up into two parts, left and right. The left part of the brain is used more for calculation and logic. While the right side is used more for creativity or seeing things as a whole. Pink tells us that in the past, the left side of the brain was looked at as more important, as side that made us human. He tells us that recently the right side of the brain has been found to be equally as important, and even more important in the future.   He then goes on to outline six key right brain concepts that will aid us in our changing society. These concepts are design, story, symphony, empathy, play, meaning. Design is the ability to create things that people like to look at. According to Pink, in today's society abundance has created a need for things to be more than functional. Everyday things need to be pleasing to look at. Pink's next skill is story. He tells how stories are being found to be extremely important. Whether it's physicians listening to patients stories or advertisers using stories. The third skill is symphony, the ability to see relationships. He says that we need to be able to see how things can work together as a whole. Pink's fourth skill is empathy, the ability to be able to relate to people. This skill is growing in importance with the increasing trend of outsourcing. The next skill is play. According to Pink, many fields are beginning to see the importance that playing can have. He says that in the medical profession, they've discovered that playing videogames increases dexterity and makes doctors less likely to make mistakes during surgery. Pink's final and most important skill is meaning. He says \\"Our fundamental drive, the motivational engine that powers human existence, is the pursuit of meaning.\\"   Daniel Pink is definitely ahead of the game with this book. His observation of previous changes in society and assertion of what the future will hold is eye-opening and almost undisputable. Both outsourcing and growing dependence on computers were beginning to create an uncertain future for us \\"white collar\\" Americans. Pink has cured any uneasiness that I felt about the jobs of the future. The Book was captivating and well supported from start to finish. Two thumbs up for Daniel Pink.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|The movie is a great foreign film.  One of the top films to come out of Europe in years.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Wow.  Let me first just say, being a fan of mostly heavy metal and the classic 80's sound, I never thought I'd review an album by Britney Spears much less own one!  Surprise!  On a spur of the moment-dare-decision, I bought Blackout just yesterday and decided to put a review on.  Why?  Because I was genuinely surprised by what I heard.    Now, there is no arguing that this album was WAY over-produced.  That said, if you put aside any and all preconcieved notions or ideas of who Spears is aside from the music industry, you can see that this album isn't half bad.  I say that because, for a \\"comeback album\\" it is very positive with the beats and grooves.  You can tell Spears doesn't let anything that has happened intrude in her positive effort put into an album.  I don't feel Spears put 100% into this album and because of that, her next output will probably be her true \\"comeback\\".  However, she has a decent output here, and with the current platform of music these days, you really can't blame her for what this album is.    1. Gimme More - The debut single and the lead off track.  Very catchy beats and a true club hit (which is basically what the whole album is).  You really can't deny how catchy it really is. 4/5    2. Piece Of Me - I really like this song.  Here, Spears brings in all the stuff said about her (albeit she tends to bring it upon herself) but remains postive.  I think this should have been her lead single.  Again catchy beats and a funny message. 4.5/5    3. Radar - This song again is very catchy.  I like how the chorus flows and Spears seems to just have fun with it. Kind of drags a bit, but will grow on you. 4/5    4. Break The Ice - I must admit, I HATE the beginning of this song when she's talking, but after that, it becomes my favorite track on the album.  Very catchy, good beat, and everything haromonizes together on this one!  A dance hit, and just a cool, cool tune. 5/5    5. Heaven On Earth - This for me is where the album begins to take a dip.This song has taken me a few listens to really enjoy, and I'm still not quite sure.  Spears tries here, but it seems a bit rushed, and is obviously one of the most \\"over-produced\\" on the album. 3.5/5    6. Get Naked (I Got A Plan) - The worst track on the album in my opinion.  I skip over it everytime.  Again, Spears seems to rush, and there seems to be no consistency on this track. 2.5/5    7. Freakshow - A slight step up from the previious track, but still nothing special.  Spears just seems to have the need to constantly remind people that she's an adult and does what she wants.  Not worth it on a \\"comeback\\" album. 2.5/5    8. Toy Soldier - Striking back with another dance, club song, the album pops back up.  I don't really like the overdone electronic voice here, and there seems to be too much material stuffed into one song, but it's not TOO BAD.  Funny lyrics when you really think about it! 3/5    9. Hot As Ice - First, she broke the ice, now she's hot as ice!  Another up-beat tune.  Again, funny lyrics when you put everything together.  Overall, this is a very catchy tune, with a good solid chorus. 3.5/5    10. Ooh Ooh Baby - Despite the title, this song is catchy.  It has a sort of \\"Santana\\" feel to it throughout.  You can hear a late 70's early 80's influence here, along with the new-age techno element.  Not bad. 4/5    11. Perfect Lover - This song for me, is where the album ends.  Seems to be a continuation of the previous track.  Again, keeps that dance feel, and seems to be produced just the right amount.  Again, not bad overall. 3.5/5    12. Why Should I Be Sad - This song does nothing for me, and in my opinion nothing for the album.  An ode to everything she has gone through and why she's a fighter.  However, it's done in a ballad-type way.  Bad way to end an album. 2/5    I know, I shocked myself with this purchase.  In the end, so far, I don't regret it.  If you like music mostely for the beats and the harmonizing (like me) than this album isn't halfbad.  Not true \\"comeback\\" material..but hey, what else did you expect.   3/5 overall.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I loved seeing this film again and now having it in my permanent collection.  It puts light on a neglected subject - the exploitation and decimation of thousands of Indians in Latin America and the herosim of the Jesuits who tried to save them.  I like the extra disk - especially the segment on how the casting of the Guarani was accomplished.  De Niro and Irons are outstanding!
0385512058|3.0|one of my friends is addicted to career self help books.  i sneaked this one off her shelf last week.  ferrazzi's thesis is that the key to career success is to never miss an opportunity to network, not much different from other books in that category except that the author is more explicit in how to go about it.  *****five stars for spelling it out HOW to network, most books just tell you what great thing it is and then the end.      ferrazzi gives good advice on adjusting your attitudes about personal time, giving an example about how spending your birthday away from home with work 'friends' (no such thing!, ask my friend, that's why she needs so many of these books!) can be an opportunity to tighten your network and even increase it.  many of his suggestions boil down to getting over you initial ick! reaction to using personal connections for business gain.  it even discusses how to be more talkative at parties.    one huge draw back is that it is aimed at people who don't have family obligations to tether them to reality. ferrazzi lives in a lala land of travel and expense accounts, from the way the book reads he isn't married or a father, so it's very easy for him to flit around meeting people and filling up address books.  he has nothing better to do than to eat all his meals at restuarants with other people wh also have nothing better to do.  in this way the book falls into the trap that so many other career self help books do, assuming that the intended audience has the life of leisure that the author does, assuming that the reader has the money and job that the author does.  this book's advice is solid gold if you do whatever it is that ferrazzi does and have all his money.  people who need to buy these books have more complicated lives than people who write them.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Here is a movie that not only is funny but I thought relatively wholesome in its message. I was really impressed with Rob's acting. He really engendered the qualities of each personality to a T. I think switcheroo movies are great exercises for actors to stretch their abilities. Too bad Rob other movies other than the first Duce Bigalow have not been as good. The Hot Chick however is one I can watch over and over again and profusely enjoy.

Despite the gray reality in which a member of the Stasi - the East German secret police - lives under the comunist regime in the mid eighties, we see how human beings can have their souls touched, even in the least expected moments. Ulrich Mühe presents us with an unforgetable performance.

1416914285|3.0|This was...interesting.    I unabashedly tend to pick up books that have cute-looking guys on the cover. Jace is hot on this cover.    That being said, the book was 'ok'. I liked Jace and was rooting for he and Clary to get together and then the book took a weird, Star-Wars-esque turn. Clare's writing was juvenile (which is understandable being that she is a young writer) but, I actually did like the book.    I don't know all the history about her being a fan fiction writer because fan fiction is dumb in my opinion and I don't read it, so I didn't have some of the biases that some reviewers seem to have \\"Like, OMG, Clary is such a Mary Sue! Wah!\\"     She still has some growing to do, but City of Bones was an ok first entry. That being said, I dunno if I'm going to read the next book in the series not that my favorite part of the book (the relationship between Jace and Clary) is not happening.     :/

B0000959N0|3.0|Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, should probably be described as one of Marvel's lesser superheroes; at least, nobody has yet penned a Complete Guide to him, as they have to Spiderman, X-Men, and the Fantastic Four, who have also been given filmic incarnations.  And on the whole, so far, I think their versions are better than his.  DD, like Spiderman, calls New York his hunting ground, and like Spidey he is perceived as a vigilante.  But when DD is \\"at work,\\" he's all business--there's no humor or lightness to what he does at all, and unlike Spidey, he often sets out specifically to kill those he sees as transgressors against justice.  His motivations are to some extent understandable--his alter ego, Matt Murdock, is an attorney whose father, a boxer trying for a comeback, was murdered on the night of his great triumph, and Matt himself, as a boy, was often a target for bullies--and even laudable to anyone who has grumbled about people \\"getting off on technicalities\\" or \\"beating the system.\\"  And, as is shown in an early courtroom system, Matt's superpowers, which include greatly enhanced hearing, serve him as a kind of biological lie detector: when an accused rapist claims on the stand that his victim \\"enjoyed it,\\" Matt knows by the rate of his heartbeat that he's lying.  Still, this is a very dark, violent film, and not one that I could really enjoy.  To be sure it has its moments: the early flashback to Matt's boyhood, showing his strong bond with his father, how he got his powers, and how he began to train them; the beautifully choreographed \\"fight\\" between Matt and the love of his life, Electra Nathios, on the day they meet; Daredevil's heart-stopping leaps from New York's towering buildings.  And villain Bullseye is a very creepy psycho--just the kind of person you don't want to meet in a dark alley.  At the end, though, I found myself wondering about questions that weren't addressed.  How did an orphaned kid from a poor neighborhood find the money to go to college and law school?  Why and when did Matt/Daredevil confide in his local priest regarding his secret identity?  How does an attorney whose partner gripes (good-humoredly) about their heavy load of pro bono cases afford Matt's sleek, high-tech, almost Fortress-of-Solitude-ish apartment?  Why, when he wants to go to sleep (as opposed to sleeping *with* somebody), does he submerge himself in what appears to be a coffin filled with water?  How did Matt explain the wound drilled through his shoulder by Electra's sai?  Any of these questions could have been answered very simply with a line or two of dialogue.  It's the business of a movie to make its \\"world\\" real to its viewers, to be plausible within the parameters of the universe it's set in; if it's fantasy, that's one thing, but the Marvel movies are supposed to take place in a reality only a step or two sideways from our own.  When the filmmakers don't seem to care enough about their reality to \\"make it real,\\" they spoil the movie for me.  So this is a DVD I *won't* be buying, and not one that I can recommend.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|I'm not sure how this show ever got cancelled. Although the first two seasons had a few sub-par episodes this one is mind boggling. The development of T-Pal and Trip's relationship hits a high point and the episode where Archer and the Andorians \\"work\\" together against the Xindi may be the best Star Trek episode ever.  Archerite!! HAH! Although the Enterprise does not have a set villain like other runs (Borg, Romulans, Klingons. Kardassians) I think that this lends to this branch of the Star Trek franchise having more character development. What are you waiting for. BUY IT!
1904633013|5.0|Jane Austen's timeless classic.  This is a fantastic edition!  These little books are well-made, hand-sized, have a slip cover to protect the fabric book binding, and include an attached ribbon bookmark.  Barnes and Noble used to sell them, but the editions have since been discontinued, and all B&N employees are clueless as to if they are being replaced by something similar.  A loss to libraries everywhere if they're gone for good.<br /><br />UPDATE: March 2009<br />It appears that Barnes and Noble only sold these little books with their name attached!  Most titles (and many additional ones) are still readily available on Amazon.co.uk.  Search for \\"Collector's Library.\\"  They are a bit more expensive than when they were sold at Barnes and Noble, but not much more than an average paperback.  It is worth it if you collect them.  Shipping is more, but also not too bad considering they come \\"across the pond,\\" as it were.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is a very good album.  It has what Radiohead fans are used to hearing: good beats, mellow tunes, great singing, exceptional song writting.  This album is more romantic than others, and so is a unique album, but showcases what Radiohead is good at.  I highly recommend the cd for anyone, especially fans of the band.
0143034901|5.0|this book is yet another book that was recomended to me that i would not have picked up on my own, but i'm glad i did.<br /><br />it starts out innocent enough, and then just sucks you in. the plot is fantasitc, and there are many twists and turns. the writing is very pituresque. i imagined the book in sepia tones, and yet it was quite vivid.<br /><br />it was a beautiful read. i will likely end up reading it again.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|I'm largely happy with this disk, although a few things have been bothering me, and make me hope for a revised release.  First, the exclusion of the versions of I Want You and Why Don't We....  Second, Hold Me Tight has two versions in the movie.  I'd like both.  Third, With A Little Help From My Friends has been made much more dull in this version.  Fourth, Hey Jude has vocal parts removed (when Max calls out near the end in the movie)  Fifth, and most important to me, during All You Need Is Love, the line \\"she loves you yeah, yeah, yeah has been eliminated.  This is inexcusable.  The line is in the original, and is so incredibly important to making the song complete.    I seriously hope they release an updated version at some point.    Update: I've noticed another serious annoyance.  The album version of I've Just Seen A Face is completely different from the film version.  The film version has an acoustic rhythm guitar part, an accordion, and a very different solo.  The album version has an electric rhythm guitar part, no accordion, and the solo is played on a Hammond organ-sounding instrument.    I wish I knew who to petition to get the film versions of these songs.
B00104W8T6|4.0|Juno, is one of those movies that you will either love or hate, and their is no surprise that the soundtrack is excatly the same.     This is a collection of tracks that places new indie singers in with the old guard and both old and new sit perfectly beside each other on this wonderful soundtrack.     This is a rarity in music, songs that you can play for mom and she will enjoy them, and songs that you can play for your friends and you wont be laughed at.     Juno the original sound track, is a sparkling soundtrack that is as  unique and cool as the movie is.
0375704027|5.0|Norwegian Wood is often described as the most perfect novel ever written. Should we be surprised that this incredible task was accomplished by a Japanese writer? Not me.<br /><br />Most of the world often has their eyes trained deftly on either Europe or America for the next big thing in literature. It seems that readers around the world even half-expect this when they hear about either J.K. Rowling or possibly the next Stephen King book, even though general readers find him too grocery-store, too accessible. King's worldwide appeal though is what is staggering, as well as Rowling's.<br /><br />Slowly though, people are getting out from under the knee-jerk lull of 5th Avenue ad campaigns and finding writers like Haruki Murakami.<br /><br />Norwegian Wood is considered by a lot of readers to be sub-par in comparison to his later works like [[ASIN:0679775439 The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]], [[ASIN:0375726055 Sputnik Sweetheart]] or [[ASIN:5367002145 Dance, Dance, Dance]], but that's probably just the high-brow craziness talking as this novel is a testament to all that is good in writing. Norwegian Wood launched Haruki Murakami into the heated and much-too-close stratosphere of fandom and literary worship, and sent him sailing away to quieter shores for solitude and anonymity. Instead of falling apart though, he wrote more novels that would rival each other and continually raise the bar on his story-telling.<br /><br />Murakami stated that he wrote Norwegian Wood because he wanted to see if he was capable of writing something straightforward, and what he considered mainstream; as, at the time, he felt under immense pressures to conform. A lot of his detractors in Japan had often cited that his allegorical work in the early days - [[ASIN:037571894X A Wild Sheep Chase]] and [[ASIN:0679743464 Hard-Boiled Wonderland]] - lacking, and superfluous. But the truth was, that they just didn't get it - yet.<br /><br />Norwegian Wood is the bildungsroman tale of \\"everyman\\" Toru Watanabe and the love affairs that he has with two very different and emotionally distraught women, first Naoko, his best-friend's girlfriend; and then slowly and casually, Midori. The story of Reiko though is probably the most memorable, indelible and touching, at least to me.<br /><br />I found this to be one of the truest and most wrenching books that I've ever read. If more books were written to the caliber of Norwegian Wood, we could probably just turn off the TV sets for good.ith two very different and emotionally distraught women, first Naoko, his best-friend's girlfriend; and then slowly and casually, Midori.

B00000DGUY|5.0|This is a great CD for Dire Straits, but the CD I purchased arrived with a flaw in the first cut.
B000VE439Y|5.0|A lot of people react badly to the idea of anything funny even remotely connected to the life of Christ, which is a pity because Life of Brian makes fun of ordinary folks like you and me, not Jesus!  The funny thing is not religion itself, but how narrow minded or dense people follow it.  And that is anever ending source of entertainment, especially here in this cutting, intelligent, and hysterical film.  The Latin lesson scene is one of the funniest ever, especially for anyone who has ever studied it! Good for countless hours of wasting time quoting pythonisms!
B000VI70X6|5.0|I tought this dvd has everything it needed to. I attended to one of this tour's concert in Arizona and this DVD has every single thing that happened in the concert but even better because it was recorded in the Miami's concert and so Alejandro Sanz and Wycleaf appear. It is awesome =)
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|After watching Once I fell in love with Glen. Now I see that he is an exceptional performer. I love the tone of his voice. The music is relaxing yet stimulating at the same time.
B000VR824S|5.0|A totally mesmerizing viewing and listening experience. To see all of these guitar virtuoso's in one well orchestrated venue is a real treat as they are usually in the background in many cases. Thank you for Crossroads, Eric.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Pleased with quality.  Fun movie. Don't normally purchase movies I have seen in theater, but can watch this again for the fun music.
B000U1ZV3U|3.0|I found that the picture quality is above average in this transfer to blu-ray. It does not have as much of a 3 demensionl look as I have seen in other transfers but it still has more detail than the DVD. Also black levels are farily strong as well. The reason I gave it a bit of a lower rating is because the audio is not that stellar and the sourrounds are not used much also the features are not to bad but I think it could have a little more about the movie than just about the real story of Earp
B000W9DSVW|3.0|I kind of sit on the fence with this box-set because for a blu-ray set it show a lot of grain in the picture. I think that it was intended to look that way which is also why I can't say it is realy bad. If you are a fan of the set it is a nice collection to have and that is why I bought it but is far from showing what blu-ray has to offer. The audio is also not that good but That is more because of the type of movie it is and has more dialogue and music than SFX.
B000VJ271A|5.0|David McVicar is one of my most favorite opera directors. For my taste, this is one of his most successful creations. Stage design is quite simple but very effective. Costumes are colorful. Dessay is a wonderful Manon. Her rendition of the `table aria' is maybe the most beautiful I have heard. Villazon sounds a bit strained in places (like his act III aria `Ah! fuyez, douce image' - this was the last production he participated before his half year break) but in general his singing is beautiful, like the outstanding rendering of his act II aria `En fermant les yeux'. They are both excellent actors. All the other singers are very good, with the exception of Sam Ramey whose vibrato is quite painful to my ears (but luckily his role is short).     Highly recommended!!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This movie is just outstanding. It, and Across the Universe are the two must watch movies of the year in my book. And it's not just me, one song in it is up for an Academy Award. Well deserved too. Didn't realize at first that Glen Hansard was in the Commitments. He was a minor member of the band, but boy, has he grown into a talent. And the girl, with that weird little Eastern European accent just charmed me. Quite a piano player  too. You absolutely HAVE to see this movie.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|It's the second best Bond movie released so far.  But When I get a second disk of special features, I expect more than three.  Movie = 5 stars, Special Features = 2.5 stars.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I love this series. Really wish it could have stayed on the air longer.  There weren't any interviews with Jared Leto, but the interviews with the creators and Claire Danes were great.
1401300901|1.0|I really wanted to like this book because I loved the concept and the movie looked cute.  However, I couldn't get past the first chapter due to the horrible writing.  I agree with other reviews, watch the movie or get it from the library, but don't spend your money.  There are other authors out there that are MUCH better.  Her concept is great, but she needs to take some creative writing classes!
B000KEG94C|5.0|I loved this movie...an amazing screen adaption of a stage show (and there's a number of bad film adaptations of theater shows out there). But besides throwing in the hi-def picture quality, the extras just add icing to the cake. This should be at the top of any theater lover's list.
055358894X|5.0|After reading more traditional fantasy novels, it took me a while to get hooked in this book.  After 100 pages, it was over, I WAS HOOKED!!  This book is like reading Ocean's Eleven based in a medieval Spanish setting.  Mind you I bought this book on the review from George R. R. Martin, and at first I was like, \\"Is he serious?!\\"  But for the first 100 or so pages the book builds up character, plot, and background. You don't even realize it was necessary until certain things start appearing and making you say, \\"Oooh, that's why...\\"  AWESOME!
0316067598|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I read it in 2 days.  Action packed, true story about a dangerous Navy Seal mission that went wrong in the high-mountains of Afghanistan near the Pak border.  I'M glad that Marcus Latrell wrote this book, because the world needs to know the sacrifices and the hell our military goes through on behalf of our country and the free world.  This is a great book and sure to be a classic.
0393327345|5.0|\\"Fight Club\\" is a great book. It's just that simple. If you like books at all, you've got to read it. it's got grit and grossness that the movie doesn't even come close to. it's also got the type of pop culture satire that's funny and relevant and that only palahniuk seems to deliver these days.  more than anything it's a good story.  i read it about five times the first year i had it.  it's just cool.

B0012SVF3A|5.0|Luc Besson's AngelA is a fun, funny, and soul searching little movie that will delight you right to the end.  You might even want to cry a little, smile a little, and even see yourself a little.    Like a fairytale, yet not heavy handed because the acting and the scenes and the dialogue take you right in and remind you that it is only a movie, isn't it.    Thanks Luc.

B0011QC9U6|1.0|I wrote this for a class directly after seeing the movie.<br /><br />---<br />To compare Beowulf the poem and Beowulf the film adaptation is, perhaps, a task beyond me. The film achieves what few films can--that near perfect balance between infuriating inanity and transcendental awfulness which is usually exclusive to musicals. I have had a touch to drink, however, and through the (perceived) eloquence of intoxication I feel that I may be up to the challenge of a critique. To say I am impassioned on the topic is to engage in supreme understatement--Beowulf the film will, from this day forward, serve as my single perfect example of Hollywood's utter uselessness, except perhaps as a sort of `motivational enemy' for the ideals of art.<br /><br />The film begins well enough. Hrothgar is a drunken boor who is rude to his wife (which is perhaps forgivable), the Danes are in their mead hall (which is infinitely less glorious than the hall of the poem), and the sounds of merry making are driving Grendel crazy (which is correct). Even this early in the film, however, one begins to sense that the characters have been twisted. Hrothgar is not a particularly good king--the best thing he does is sober up enough to wave his sword and yell at Grendel. Queen Wealhtheow does not respectfully serve her husband-king mead, but spits on him when he tries to drag her to bed. When Beowulf arrives, he does not offer his services in a spirit of noble duty as Beowulf of the poem seems to, but instead blusters in and obnoxiously yells his boasts at the gathered crowd; when challenged by Unferth as to the swimming contest, he tells the tale of the sea monsters, but according to the film, much of it is exaggerations or lies.<br /><br />And this is what drives the film; Beowulf the poem is an exaggeration or a lie. The filmmakers engage in the same mistake that Tolkien criticized in \\"The Monsters and the Critics,\\" namely, an attitude of intense historical criticism which does not appreciate the poem as a work of art. The film is not at all `realistic,' however. It retains the fantasy elements of the poem (monsters, demons, dragons) but applies the story with the trowel of ugly cynicism, which is likely just an attempt to justify making the film by `putting a different perspective to it.' And the filmmakers have the GALL to take potshots at the original poem by referencing it in the movie. \\"The Song of Beowulf\\"--i.e., the poem we know today--is the `official version' of Beowulf's story which Beowulf's court bards promulgated and which we poor contemporary saps buy into.<br />The list of offenses is endless, ranging from the contradiction of small details to an entire reworking of major plot points. Glorious speeches are truncated to fits of lusty yells; religion is referenced in a few derisive remarks. In order to satisfy the Hollywood requirement for romance, Beowulf falls in love with Wealhtheow. And in order to satisfy the Hollywood requirement for sex, everyone is given to sleeping with either people they're not supposed to or demons.<br /><br />In fact, this is the beginning of progressive deviations from the poem's plot--Hrothgar, it seems, slept with Grendel's mother and is the secret father of Grendel. After killing Grendel (who apparently shrinks in size when you hit him enough), Beowulf goes to kill Grendel's mother and ends up sleeping with her also (thereby gaining not only Angelina Jolie but promises of fame and power). Instead of becoming king of the Geats, Beowulf becomes king of the Danes after Hrothgar wills his kingdom to Beowulf and then commits suicide.

B000VWP4EO|4.0|When it came to the 90's for Elton John, he returned to the roots of making dominant albums. After his recovery from his addictions to drugs and alcoholism, he made some of the best music that had shown in years. With the success of albums like The One from 1992 and the 1995 overlooked masterpiece Made In England, which returned him to the classic roots of 70's albums. But, for the following few years, he had dealt a double whammy of blows which coincided with the deaths of his friends Gianni Versace and Princess Diana. It showed into what made his follow-up to Made In England a much more subdued but deeply creative album that showed in the reflection.<br /><br />Elton John's 1997 album The Big Picture doesn't completely showcase a dominance that was shown in his music from earlier times. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean the album is medicore. The album does include some really good songs, but all of them were mainly overshadowed by the #1 smash, Something About The Way You Look Tonight, which was a part of the Candle In The Wind 1997 single to show in memory of Princess Diana's death. Regardless, this record was all done on memory of Gianni Versace. Other than Something About The Way You Look Tonight, there are a lot of surprising songs here like the Gospel-influenced If The River Can Bend, the overlooked Recover Your Soul, and slow mid-tempo somberness of songs like the opening track Long Way From Happiness to the depths of Live Like Horses, all the way to the essence of beginnings as detailed in January.<br /><br />All in all, The Big Picture isn't a bad album for die hard Elton John fans and has some meaningful songs, but it doesn't do enough to bring in newcomers to Elton John's music. Still, it is a pretty good album that says so much from the heart and that is really the actual big picture.<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: B-
B000MR9D5E|5.0|First and foremost, Planet Earth is absolutely remarkable. The technology and methods used to produce this series is unprecedented. I would find this series enjoyable in SD, but HD takes this to a whole new level. My experience with this series has been nothing short of outstanding.    I have just finished reading reviews by those who gave it low scores and I am not amazed by the stupidity inherent in common humans.    Most of the negativity reflected by those who actually were able to view the series is based upon the concept of \\"predator and prey,\\" which they view as \\"cruel and disgusting.\\"    In response to these comments, let me first ask you this: when conservation is discussed, how do you not focus on predator and prey? As they both rely on each other for survival and sustainability, it seems obvious that any documentary would dedicate significants amount of time and effort into this apsect of life. What happens when the prey disappears? The predator also disappears, as it has no food. What happens when the predator disappears? The prey becomes over abundant and exhausts the resources necessary for its' survival, resulting in a significant decline in its' population.    To drive my point home, consider sharks. Sharks, as an apex predator, control the seas by regulating the abundance of its' prey. This system works itself all the way down to the bottom of the food chain, keeping all other subsequent \\"predators and prey\\" in check. This balance-and-check system has allowed life to remain sustainable since its' beginning. If the \\"balance-and-check\\" system is disturbed in a significant way, then massive extinction events result, especially when an apex predator is removed from the picture. Over time, the system recovers, but under a new apex predator that relies on new prey. Depending on who you talk to, sharks may be the reason why we even exist today. Because sharks as a whole are on the brink of extinction, we shall soon find out how important predation really is, especially considering that the amount of food we rely on for our survival come fromes the oceans they control.    So if predation is so \\"cruel and disgusting\\" why has it flurished for millions of years. When you find yourself so dissatisfied with this aspect of life, what were you planning on eating for dinner. And yes, plantlife is every bit alive as any other living organism, so saying you don't eat meat doesn't resolve the fact that you are disgusted with predation.    I think the thing you should be more disgusted with is humans. We are the smartest virus the world has ever seen...a cancer on a monumental scale. We grow, replicate, consume and destroy without consequence. All for selfish reasons. Families have 3,4,5 and 6 children, all because they \\"want to.\\" All because its the right thing to do, right? Well, unfortunately, at some point in their life, you will have to tell them that its their responsibility to fix everything that mankind has done to destroy the world we live in. This task is so unfair, that they will pass it off onto the next generation, and so on, until it's too late for anything to be done.    We all want to live longer and healthier lives. We want to cure disease and not have to worry about dying from infections such as HIV, or bodily mishaps such as cancer. But when you think about why these things are so difficult to prevent and treat you must also ask yourself if we are even supposed to cure them. How do we know that they didn't develop for a reason. Maybe Earth, herself, brought this all about to cure her disease. Maybe she made them in a way as to prevent them from being cured. From her point of view, we are the disease, we are the HIV and we are the cancer. Maybe HIV, cancer, etc... is Earth's cure for mankind. The last time I checked, there was only one living organism that could go extinct and not have a negative impact on Earth. That organism is MANKIND!    And in the end, when its' all said and done, there is one thing to remember...there can be no life without death.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|What a great sound and it lands right in my heart and makes me so happy every time I listen to it.  Like when you want ice cream you want Dulce de Leche, when I want music I want Vampire Weekend.  Just in time, when everything else sucks, a breath of fresh air blows in.  More!  More!  Can't wait to see them again live.  Oxford Comma is the best.  Bryn is pretty swell, too.
B00104W8T6|4.0|Good indie music...really like the CD and enjoyed the movie. It's the kind of CD you put on your car stereo while taking a road trip.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The third part finally. Although 4 hour long this is a great listening. Always interesting and so vivid. I still think is it too expensive and I just do not have the time to sit still for 4 hours in front of my 5.1 system but it is worth it. Beautiful package. Great music. A must for LFTR and music fanatics.
0060531053|5.0|This is simply the best book for beginners which I have ever come across. I started brewing with it in 1991 and still use it! The humour is corny and some of the recipes are a bit dodgy, but Papazian has an easy to understand style AND remains simple.   Of course, once you get past the intermediate stage of brewing, it is best to complete your collection with more advanced writings.   RELAX, HAVE A HOMEBREW!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Great movie. Clever way to journey through the 60s. The Beatle music is awesome even if it is not sung by them!!!
B000HIVOI2|5.0|My first Blu-Ray movie, never seen the movie in theaters so this is a real treat.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|If anyone is looking to this franchise for horror, your wasting time. This is an action movie.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Good movie packaged for standard format display (vice the wide-screen version, avalable seperatly).  Product and its closed captioning support for the hearing impaired works just fine.
B0000046KX|5.0|My favorite, (\\"Verse\\" being second).  Her voice, composing. piano all in top form on every piece.  Wins you over the first time through.  I own and listen to most of her cds and this one is powerful and accessible all the way through.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Wonderful cinematography!  Watch it on a high def flat screen and it's like being right there!
B000H5TVKI|5.0|Contemporary mythology, as Joseph Campbell once said, is how mankind is remembered both culturally and anthropologically. It is what lasts...    With that in mind, amongst the memorable archetypes of the last 50 years or so comes John Rambo. As easily misunderstood by critics as he is by everyone in his filmic universe, he is sometimes written off as a 'killing machine'. This misses the point. John Rambo is really every man who was called by his people to go to war for them. It's just played on a broad cinematic canvas.    War is hell, as anyone who has ever experienced it can tell you. And the absolute impossibility of conveying those experiences with anyone outside the realm has created, particularly in our media savvy society, a number of disaffected and alienated young men. It is to this that Sylvester Stallone's nicely nuanced performance speaks.    Beautifully shot in the Pacific Northwest, Stallone's Rambo is a drifter  ostensibly in search of a Vietnam buddy whom he finds has died from toxic Agent Orange poisoning. What he is really searching for is is soul- and his humanity. The reception he is given by the town Sheriff (played beautifully by Brian Denehy) is an allegory for how we, as a society, have used and then turned our back on these young men. Ridiculed, humiliated, and jailed, Rambo takes war against the new enemy- those  who are tormenting him.    The plot thickens nicely when Colonel Sam Trautman (the hugely underrated  Richard Crenna) shows to 'take charge' of the situation. Seems he trained  Rambo in the Special Forces and commanded him in Vietnam. What he really  is is the estranged father figure that Rambo desperately wants approval  from. This works extremely well on a deeper psychological level than one might expect from a 'B' actioner.    This is an important film. Important for it's cultural significance, for John Rambo is truly a great Ameican icon in the clasic sense. Important too, is it's impact on filmaking- his characterization has been copied endlessly by the likes of Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris, all of which lack the subtext that Stallone brought.    I do suggest, however, that one skips the next two installments in the series (they're ok, but just really potboilers) and instead see his superb followup out in theaters now. Called simply 'Rambo', it serves well as a coda for the character.    Forget the critics on this one, folks, and particularly the excellent Blu-Ray transfer will have you more involved than ever before. This movie satnds the test of time.      Don Case
B000J103WA|1.0|very nice case all sealed up but there is nothing on the dsc.. will not play in any of my dvd players.. very upset about this purchase so i probably will never shop amazon again.. also took about 9 days to receive product
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I loved the CDs, and the DVD.  All of Garth's hits are here, and some others that I'd not heard before.  There is only one song that I did not like, but that's okay.  I have both CDs in my truck and sing along when I have to do road trips.  I also like that there are a LOT of numbers on each CD, not just 7 or 8.  And the DVD is fun to have on when nothing's on TV.  Overall, very good selection, well-produced, good sound quality, loved it.
B000WO251Q|3.0|I realy enjoyed this book overall. Their were a few parts that were kind of slow,especially in the beginning. But once the story progressed, it got better.     The story starts off as John is a troubled kid, with a father he does not relate too. He is at the beach and falls in love with a girl named Savannah. They hit it off, and hang together for awhile, until he has to go back to germany where he is stationed. He is about to get out of the military and then 911 happened. He wants to do his country a favor or the right thing and reenlist. After he does this, the couples problems start to happen.      The end is good, if you love someone, you do anything to make them happy. No matter what that is.
B00005JPSM|4.0|Once upon a time there lived a grown-up woman, renowned in all the land for her fabulous cooking. But as is often true when someone excels in one area, that person lacks in all others. This remarkable chef (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has a lovely sister who excels in being a mom to daughter Zoe (Abigail Breslin). As is often the case these two sisters had a father unremarkable for being a nonexistent father. So these two sisters choose to live their lives without men.<br /><br />Then a terrible thing happens: the mother/sister dies in a car accident, leaving Zoe with the aunt who is a chef also famed for keeping her distance from people. Enter Kate and Zoe, struggling to deal with first, the loss of their beloved, then this new situation and environment. Child and woman, these two, have difficulty meeting on a common ground. There is no spark, no warmth between them. It's not that Kate resents poor Zoe--she just cannot connect with her. It's not that Zoe resents Kate--she is just too sad.<br /><br />Enter Nick, the slight-of-hand, the guy with the charm and wit, but good charm and sensitive wit, who can read people. He is the synapse who clicks the two--child and woman into a synergy of three people. The loveliest part of the movie is the time the three spend the day together, just doing and being.<br /><br />Zoe needs to be loved, Kate needs only her job, and the restaurant owner needs a sous chef until Kate adjusts to her new role as a caretaker. Nick (Aaron Eckhart), the sous-chef needs to be needed, not that he is wimpy. He is quite gregarious and fun-loving, but he likes cooperation and congenial surroundings, light-heartedness amidst an often chaotic profession. Kate is all about being serious and professional.<br /><br />When faced with change, people themselves must change or remain static and find themselves left behind specifically in relationships. When Nick begins to woo Kate, he is so cool. Instead of pouncing on her like a wild beast, he leaves her wanting more--just a kiss,  just a kiss. Clever man!<br /><br />The ending far surpasses what is expected and I will leave it at that. Aaron Eckhart brought exactly the right charisma to his role. He looks the part of a temperamental chef without being one. Catherine Zeta-Jones is finally showing just the blush of aging and it becomes her. She plays her reserve with just the right coolness, exhibiting just a trace of passion below the surface.  Any child could have played the girl. On the verge of prepubescence, Abigail Breslin simply did not display her usual cuteness, whether the director, the role, or Abigail herself.<br /><br />As much a part of the film as any character is the romance of food and wine and music, much of it opera arias with some Italian love songs thrown in. As a matter of fact, I have already ordered the CD. One of the female waitstaff walks through the kitchen to tell Nick that opera is great music for lovemaking just as he said. It certainly is when Kate and Nick finally do kiss. I kept wondering if Michael was watching his wife film this scene. It's a good one.<br /><br />Not Academy Award material, but definitely date fare. And, oh husbands and wives, it might remind you of that first fire of your love for the other. A wonderfully pleasant little movie!<br /><br />About the title: To eat in the restaurant in this story, one must make reservations. However, for love of any kind, no reservations are required..

B000YA82F6|4.0|This is the movie about Juno, a 16 year old girl who ends up getting pregnant and opts to give the baby up for adoption over keeping the baby or aborting it.  She finds a nice couple who seems great for the baby... or are they?    I liked this movie.  My only complaint was the dialog.  At the beginning of this movie the characters all used language that nobody ever really uses.  It was like the script writer thought that American kids only spoke in 1337-speak and dork.  As the movie progressed this seemed to go away more and more and by the end everybody seemed to be speaking English again but then whoever wrote this forgot to go back and put everything else back into English.    But everything else is great!    First, this is a total character piece.  At the end of this you seem to care for everybody in this movie except for that one character could step in front of a movie bus and nobody would shed a tear.  But it seemed that everybody else was somebody who was alive that we actually could believe in, identify with, and care about and that is what made this movie fantastic.  It is much better than the usual Hollywood garbage where explosions, casual sex, and witty dialog come first and the characters are completely forgotten.    The acting isn't too bad though there were some scenes where I had to check my ticket stub to make sure I hadn't landed in the sequel to Napoleon Dynamite.  Actually, it was fine because I don't think anything ever went over the top too much.  It actually made things a bit more real.    I rarely mention this in my reviews because it doesn't catch my attention too often, but the music was very nice for this movie.  Not only was it nice to listen to but it seemed to fit the story extraordinarily well.  I'd love to pass some extra kudos for that.    This turned out to be a great use of my time and I think most people would actually enjoy this movie.  If you love a good character piece, you can't go wrong with this one.
0767903862|4.0|Bryson really captures the essence of Australia by detailing his experiences and interactions in different places throughout the country. Using humor or strange conversations, he conveys the attitude and friendly personalities of the the Aussies. While spending long passages describing too many historical details that he might only find interesting, he dives deep into the culture and history of a country most people know nothing about. Seeing as I just moved here, this introduction was perfect to welcoming me here. :)
0307237702|5.0|I marvel at a man's passion and excellence. But more movingly is his deep thinking about this country, about policy issues. I am surprised that his mind is occupied by how to create fame for himself, but how to tackle problems facing this country. He is larger than a politician. There is greatness about this man, who steps out his narrow self.<br /><br />From his fresh eyes who just joined the Senate for 2 years, Obama describe the process that can corrupt a democratic senate. In order to get large donation, you start to dine and wine the top 1% people: banker, CEOs, venture investors. You start to enjoy private jet and special status. You are indebted to union and large interest group who has the power to break your campaign. All of these is because the large fee of TV advertising which requires millions of dollars. How can we reform this system so that a candidate no longer has to cave to these interest groups?<br /><br />Obama also mentioned thousands of bills he has to vote for or against each year. The complexity of each bill makes every voting an agonizing experience. I hope we can adopt national referendum soon, like people do in California. This will not only reduce the work load for those law makers, but also empower people to make direct decisions.<br /><br />The Audacity of Hope is an excellent book. It's beautifully written with remarkable of literacy flavor. It about a man's journey in his latest political career (State and US senate, democratic convention speech). But it is refreshingly real, personal. It gives you hope for what is good and what is right.
6305212112|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I never get tired of watching it.
0060254920|5.0|This is one of my favorite books from childhood.  I recently bought a copy for my nephew for christmas, and he loved it!  I think it may have something to do with him relating to the character Max so much.    It had been quite a while since i had seen or read it, and all the great memories came flooding back once i opened the first few pages.  The art is simply beautiful and captures the imagination....everything from the bedroom to the island, to the way the creatures are handled....perfect.      Its my hope that someday he will pass it onto his kids when he gets old enough.  But until then, I hope he enjoys it as much as I did when I was his age.
B000W07EKW|5.0|These are great action movies!  I like The Bourne Ultimatum best, but they are all good and worth watching over and over.
038572179X|4.0|Great book, fast read, wonderful story from everyone's point of view.  Can't wait to see the movie now...
1591841666|3.0|It's an important question, and one that this short, easy-to-read book from Seth Godin will certainly get you thinking about.<br /><br />Sadly Godin doesn't really give us the clues, the tips or the techniques for determining which is which - and getting it wrong could be a disastrous strategy.  I was left feeling vaguely dissatisfied - like there was something I was missing, or maybe a follow-up book that I needed to wait for.<br /><br />Perhaps that was deliberate - a part-answered question is a good way to get us talking after all, a remarkable 'purple cow' kind of strategy that Godin recommends.<br /><br />In any event I do feel more aware of the question after reading the book, and find myself testing different situations to try and assess if they're 'dips' or 'cul-de-sacs'.<br /><br />I'd say that was benefit enough to spend the time reading this short book.
B00104W8T6|5.0|This is a great soundtrack...most of the songs are by Kimya Dawson, but they tell a great story and she's got a very unique voice.  It's a fun, light-hearted soundtrack.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I grew up hearing Mary Martin sing the Neverland song on the soundtrack to Peter Pan, so this one is deep in my bones.  When I was a child I saw the play Peter Pan when a touring production came to my town, and I later read Barrie's original play and a book version of the Peter Pan story, and then of course saw the Disney version.  I was always touched by the fact that Barrie donated the royalties to a particular orphanage, and I love seeing how that comes about in this film.  We viewed the film as a family after it came out on DVD, and I bought the DVD for my husband for Valentine's Day because he liked it so much!  He always likes Johnny Depp.  I was particularly pleased that my husband did not feel manipulated or tearjerked in any way by this film.  The performances of the children, Depp, and Kate Winslet are all honest, sweet, quirky, and true, and what needs to remain mysterious does remain mysterious, and what needs to open up into the imagination does so seamlessly!  Charming film!
0143038419|5.0|This book was OK.  This woman is a little over the top for me.  I'm still not sure she learned to love herself.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I got this and The Swell Season, which has some of the same songs on it, after hearing an NPR radio interview with the singer/songwriters.  Now I'd like to see the film Once.  The soundtrack album has a bit more glitz and polish, and The Swell Season a bit more of the raw-art feel, but both are earnest, sincere, heartfelt CDs, with powerful music that is mournful and joyous.  \\"Falling Slowly\\" is gorgeous on both, and \\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\\" makes me giggle every time.
B00001U0DP|5.0|A truly beautiful, inspirational film. Brings back the child in all of us and reminds us to live in the moment. A return to the era of grand cinema.  Recommended to all....you'll laugh...you'll cry......its a hellova movie.    Susie
0679805273|5.0|Oh, The Places You'll Go is yet another wonderful book written by that genius Dr. Seuss. In this book children are encouraged to explore the world and to avoid letting a bad experience hinder them from exploring more new places and things. Naturally, younger children will also profit from this book as a tool to learn how to read and sound out new words as they increase their vocabulary at the same time. Great!<br /><br />The book starts by asking children to use their imaginations to think up what the real world might be like out there; and parents can help their children by teaching them about the world out there, too. This sets things up for an exciting and educational discussion between parent and child about the real world out there. Seuss clearly puts the child in the driver's seat when he writes \\"and YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.\\" Seuss encourages kids to always strive to explore while being creative and open to new things; Seuss writes that \\"you'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.\\" Can you imagine how stimulating that must be to a young child just breaking out of their shell? It's very good.<br /><br />However, Seuss remains honest about life. This book also teaches young children that sometimes they may not like a certain place they've come to but that they should never let that discourage them from going on to bigger and better things once more.<br /><br />The text has great rhyming and the illustrations are wonderful.<br /><br />The hardcover book can withstand accidental attempts to damage it without breaking at all; and the paper quality is rather good, too.<br /><br />Overall, this fine book from Dr. Seuss is indispensable for encouraging young children to explore the world around them and to never quit. Younger children can also benefit from this book as they learn to read and improve their vocabularies.
B00005JPUN|1.0|Simply terrible. Aside from being able to bask in the magnificence of Ms. Kidman, who is indeed magnificent and does all she can with her role, this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Sophomoric white bread direction, shameful use of news footage and witness interviews from the latest shuttle disaster, zero character development, bland camera work and editing, no emotions (it's hard to tell when characters have turned since aside from Kidman the screenwriters and director don't allow the cast to convincingly exhibit any emotion while still human,) and no pods!    This could be a hundred other movies over the last twenty years - bad guys chase good guys around downtown Washington DC, car chases every five minutes, cell phones, elevator buttons, basement parking lots, cars on fire, child must be rescued, blah blah blah.     Oh, and instead of pods the \\"disease\\" is passed by people throwing up. In people's coffee. In each other's faces. Nice, thanks for that. That's really challenging intellectually. That's fine scriptwriting. Is that the Academy calling?    The original remains an almost sacred masterpiece and it still hasn't been topped. The remake staring Donald Sutherland was excellent and genuinely creepy, cleverly directed and scripted. The third version was quite OK. This edition is beyond lame and doesn't for a second create a tenth as much mood as an average Twilight Zone episode. Your standard dog food commercial is more frightening, more mysterious. (And better directed.)    If you want to find a textbook case of how void of creativity big studio Hollywood has become, and how they denegrate the intellect of their audience, look no further.
0689835604|5.0|My 15 month old daughter just loves this book! This is absolutely her favorite. We HAVE to read this every night before going to bed. She loves flipping the flaps to find each of the body parts. The illustrations are cute, and it is a perfect length for a young child.

B0000D96NW|3.0|\\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\", is Machine Heads fifth studio album, and after a the dismal reviews of \\"Supercharger\\" from both fans and reviewers, maybe the band finally heard some of the negitive, and decided to get back on track to just playing straight up Metal. Now, I always thought that Machine Head was a Nu Metal band, but with their own signiture sound, because when I use the term Nu Metal, and use it to describe pretty much alternitive or industrial Metal. Some use the term as to label any Heavy Metal that is popular or radio friendly, but i just simplety call that generic or recycled nu metal. I explain this so Machine Heads dont get offended that I used the term to describe them even on the first two albums (which I know are fan favorites, including myself) So on the the review of \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" Does the band finally get back on track here? Well yes and no. Its stronger song wise then \\"Burning Red\\" and obviously anything is better then \\"Supercharger\\", but it still has some annoying poppy/generic nu metal riffs and vocal that I cant stand, and wish the band would just abandon. Maybe I am being to critical, as some reviewers call this a return to form. YES, I agree to a point, its nice to have the band getting back on track, but they still have some work to do. Reviewers tend to get mad when others write such things as \\"this isnt \\"Burn my eyes\\" or \\"the more things change, so get over it\\" I myself understand that, and no album by the band might ever match those, but I want to see an effort to get back to that time period, build on it, and abandon the whole pop/generic/nu/new/crapola sound (: They might not release another masterpiece, but at least try. Still, this isnt a bad album, and even with some faults its the best thing they did since \\"The More Things Change\\" Out of eleven tracks, I love six of them. Thats not to bad. Some of the others are OK, worth a listen or two, and two of them really suck, I just hit skip. I good effort here, above average Machine Head album, but there is still some work to do. ENJOY
B0000041Q3|5.0|This version is certainly the best for me.  Joan Sutherland  has always been my favourite, I was lucky enough to have seen her performing several times.  She is exceptional.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The movie was great because of the music.  The songs are hauntingly beautiful and the vocals are passionate and satisfying.  They play over and over in my mind even when the CD is done.
1594489505|5.0|I read THE KITE RUNNER  in two days. I loved it. However, Hosseini outdoes himself with his second novel A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS. Compared to THE KITE RUNNER this book has the same smooth flowing tone. What stands out though is the depth Hosseini has given his characters. Where characters in THE KITE RUNNER felt knowable, Mariam and Laila are lovable and personal to the reader.<br /><br />The chronology which plots the course of A THOUSAND SPLENDID is simple to follow and for me, provided a greater insight to the characters as I was able to watch them develop in response to their historical surroundings.<br /><br />Aside from Capote and Jonathan Lethem, Hosseini is the only other author in which the tone of their writing allows me to completely fell their characters. To be honest with you, five stars is simply not enough.
B000GFLEBI|4.0|The original interpretation of Red Dragon was entitled Manhunter.  It is typical Michael Mann fare from the 80's.  Lots of music video moments with people staring off into space while rock n' roll plays in the background.  It's just okay.  But this film, Bret Ratner's Red Dragon, is something more.  The novel on which it is based is very detailed in its descriptions of the killer's activities as well as those of Hannibal Lector.  Moreover, the techniques used to hunt him down are described with equal aplomb.  It is important, then, that this film explore those things in a measured and meticulous way.  And so they are.  Edward Norton turns in a fine performance as the tortured investigator with an unfortunate gift for seeing inside the minds of serial killers.  Anthony Hopkins as Lector is always enjoyable if a bit over-the-top and Emily Watson is intriguing as the blind film lab technician Reba who falls for Francis Dolarhyde.  And it is Ralph Fiennes' performance as Dolarhyde that gives this film its power and appeal.  He is clearly insane, on that point there can be no debate.  But once he finds a chance for love an acceptance through Reba he begins to doubt his transformation into the Dragon that has driven him to kill again and again.  Tom Noonan's performance in Manhunter was alright, but Ralph Fiennes nails it sinking deep into the character's paranoia and random flashing rage in a way that both terrifies and entrances.  Red Dragon delivers on the promise of Manhunter twenty years on.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I purchased this for my husband's birthday, and he is very satisfied with the collection. It's even better than he thought it would be.

1932100660|5.0|a few months ago my husband and I were in a restaurant in Northern California and there was a table of elderly people and I overheard one gentleman talking about the \\"china study\\" and how it had changed the way they eat.  When I got home I went to Amazon's site and read the reviews and  decided to buy it. I was not expecting to be impressed, but I sure was.  the author is not boring or stuffy and he made a lot of sense. My husband has been after me for years to DRINK MILK and i have always refused. Guess what? after he read the book, he is now drinking only soy milk.  We are eating lots more fruits,veggies, etc.  We have cut out dairy almost completely and are working on totally cutting out all animal products.  I sent this book to my father (who is a health nut), he is 79 years old and followed the one month diet and feels great.  I also sent it to my sister and co-workers. The book is an eye-opener and just goes to show that you cannot trust the media and the big bucks of the big corporations.
B00003CXDG|1.0|Okay, so De Palma's film wasn't Citizen Kane, but at least it had its moments when Cruise's insatiable vanity was kept in check in favour of some well-executed set-pieces (even if one was stolen lock, stock and barrel from Topkapi). Woo's disastrous sequel - at the time the most expensive film ever made - is like an endless hairspray commercial, with the ever limited Cruise (who used to be able to act but now just runs off a checklist of six annoying expressions) constantly flicking his hair in glowing slo-mo - you keep on expecting him to say 'Because I'm worth it.' Unfortunately, they're so busy making him look pretty that they forget to include any of the basics of a Summer movie. The action scenes are few and far between and not worth the wait; the script is another lazy and lifeless stinker from Robert Towne that rivals his Love Affair for banal inconsequentiality; and the Brits in the cast let the side down even more than Woo, Cruise and Towne combined - Thandie Newton seems semi-comatose, Hopkins hams it up and cashes the cheque, while Dougray Scott demonstrates just how dull an actor he can be even when mugging relentlessly. The only good thing that came of this film was the over-runs keeping Scott from playing Wolverine in X-Men: judging from his subsequent performances on screen and stage, if being boring on screen was an Olympic sport, this guy would win Scotland gold every time.     Possibly the most tedious vanity production ever made. Good extras on the DVD, but that's the best that can be said for it.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This gem of a movie captured me from the first scene. While the story could have been overdramatic and over the top, the skillful writing and direction kept it grounded.<br /><br />It is a substantial story that explores wealth and poverty, love and the pain it causes, and how people face the end of life (and life as they knew it). Tough decisions must be made and reality must be faced, especially  the reality that occurred 20 years before.<br /><br />\\"After the Wedding\\" is so well-acted and beautifully filmed - what a pleasure to watch.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|The car chase in Bullitt may seem a bit less impressive than it once did because filmmakers have been trying to top it for the best part of four decades. More of a cat-and-mouse game than a demolition derby, its overshadowed by the film's other action setpieces - a murder in a safe house, a tense chase in a hospital and a great airport finale that Michael Mann ripped off wholesale in Heat. A beautifully constructed star vehicle for Steve McQueen at his best, it's pretty much the prototype for every Hollywood cop movie that followed, but benefits from good casting (Robert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Simon Oakland, Robert Duvall), better characterisation than the norm and a low key approach from director Peter Yates that makes the highs seem a lot more effective than they should. The plot's not bad either, with Lalo Schifrin contributing a cool score and Pablo Ferra a terrific main title sequence.     The 2-disc set certainly boasts an improved transfer over the original single-disc release, but aside from Yates audio commentary, a vintage making of featurette and the trailer, the extras aren't that film specific - a good feature-length documentary on film editing and another on McQueen.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|This is the most amazing video purchase I've ever made. The discs themselves are very revealing for both fans of this groundbreaking movie and general film study. The documentaries and wonderfully insightful and even Harrison comes out to say a few things, which is something most fans probably didn't expect. Amazingly, every cut of the film is included and the clarity of each disc is phenomenal.<br />The box is very well designed even having hinges as opposed to the usual bent plastic spine and mimics the briefcase holding Deckards famous Voight Kampff machine. The extra \\"toys\\" it comes with are cool especially the Spinner which again, could've been another cheap thing but this is actually quite a good little model replete with opening doors.<br />And also, I must say that the price of this item is extraordinary considering the value of the discs alone. I would've paid much more for something this special.
B000EGDB10|4.0|Shot in Prague before it became synonymous with cheap labor and tax breaks for runaway productions, the initial signs were less than promising for Mission: Impossible - rumors of clashes between Cruise and Brian De Palma, the latter pointedly keeping a very low public profile when the film opened, last-minute heavy re-editing and the dropping of Alan Silvestri's original score (not, it has to be said, anywhere near as effective as Danny Elfman's replacement) - yet the result is a lot more fun than it has any real right to be. There's little relation to the original series aside from the title, Lalo Schifrin's theme music and an ill-done by Jim Phelps, here played by Jon Voight rather than Peter Graves - indeed, the original cast turned down offers of cameos in a film which kills off almost the entire Impossible Mission Force in the first twenty minutes so the star can hog the spotlight. But then, in those days Tom Cruise still sold more tickets than anyone else and the film raked it in - as they say in gangster movies, it's nothing personal, just business.     Although it was apparently Emmanuelle Beart's role that bore the brunt of the pre-release cuts, Cruise is in more danger of being overshadowed by co-stars Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, neither of whom get as many close-ups but make up for it with much more unforced charisma and screen presence. The plot doesn't always make sense - there's really no reason to break into the CIA's headquarters in Langley to steal a real list of undercover agents' names to use as bait other than allowing the director to stage a Topkapi-inspired high-wire heist - but it just about serves to fill in the gaps between setpieces, including a neat sequence that's pure De Palma where one character's explanation of events is accompanied by visuals gradually piecing together what really happened and a doozey of an action sequence involving a helicopter in the Channel Tunnel that caused the Bond producers to drop their original storyboarded-but-unshot Channel Tunnel pre-title sequence from the script of GoldenEye as well as boasting a neat line in spectacularly breaking windows.     No classic but an above-average Summer movie that holds up surprisingly well. Although an improvement over the bare-bones original DVD release, there's a distinct feeling that the reverential special features on the new special edition are there merely to reassure Cruise and his fans that he is indeed the most special and wonderful person in the world.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Yes, I love this movie.  I wore out my VHS copy and I've gone on to DVD players.  Can clearly remember the day in 1993, when I first saw it!!  Such a great blending of fantastic comedy and indepth analysis of real-life and how all of us (yes, I mean ALL of us) continue to do the same things overandoverandover again and again.  Creatures of habit.  But after running into the same wall enough times, sometimes we learn. And after we learn the lesson overandoverandagain sometimes we change. MY new lifetime goal is to take in a GroundHog Day/February 2nd in Woodstock, IL sometime soon.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Warner Bros.' favourite son's first film outside the studio since the mid-seventies (also the first scored by Morricone in even longer) resulted in one of the best thrillers of the Nineties. The premise is simple, offering Eastwood's ageing secret service agent, who failed to save JFK, the chance for redemption by stopping Malkovich's assassin, who latches on to his guilt in an engrossing cat-and-mouse game. The idea of the criminal and his pursuer forging a bond has been done many times before, but seldom as well as here.<br /><br />What really makes it work is the strength of the characterisation, giving the audience a stake in the protagonists that adds to the tension. As a result, Eastwood and Malkovich's confrontations (filmed simultaneously rather than separately to give an edge to the performances) are as electrifying as the edge-of-seat action sequences. Even the use of CGi is subtle and well integrated into the story rather than drawing constantly attention to themselves.<br /><br />Self-deprecating, self-doubting, the kinder, gentler Eastwood on show here gives his most likeable performance to date, while the beautifully underplayed and surprisingly moving scene where he describes the events of that fateful day in Dallas is one of the finest moments in his career. The erratic John Malkovich is more than a match for him, contributing his best screen work to date, with a good supporting cast also on strong form, while Wolfgang Petersen's direction, Maguire's script and John Bailey's outstanding photography all make strong impressions.<br /><br />The special edition does offer some good special features and a good widescreen transfer.

B000W1V5VU|1.0|The color balance on this was so bad I returned the disc, thinking that it was defective.  The characters have orange skin, the contrast loses all the shadow details, and the color is so saturated that it's almost unwatchable.  It was NOT this bad in the theater.    I finally turned down the color on my TV by 50% to make it through the movie.  This disc has the same problem on two different DVD players and two different TVs - it's the encoding, not the hardware.    Skip this unless you're on a B&W set!

1594489505|5.0|This extraordinary novel, seen through the eyes of an Afghan woman from youth to maturity, is a literary experience you won't forget.  It gives us readers here in the West a horrifying view of what it is to be subjugated woman in the third world.  Paradoxically, it also illustrates the gentility of society in Afghanistan and in the Middle East in general.  It is as complex as life, and full of surprises and suspense.  This is, in my opinion, an even better book than The Kite Runner. Indulge yourself in this literary, popular phenomenon.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|It is worth getting this Blu-ray DVD set. The video quality is amazing. Shakira was outstanding. Over all, it's superb. A great addition to my musical collection...
B0011NVCO8|4.0|First of all, I love the movie. When I watched this movie in the theater I was dazed and couldn't believe the great imagery, the magnificent acting by Denzel Washington (one of my favorite actors) and Russell Crowe, but also the seamless and very personal direction by Ridley Scott, who has made such great films as Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, and Gladiator. I was looking forward to getting this movie and it was one of the reasons I bought a HD DVD player last January (not the only reason, of course). Which is why this release is such a letdown.  The picture quality on this release didn't stand out as much as Batman Begins or Bourne Supremacy, or even The Thing, did, but it is quite good. The picture was just too dark several times and the colors were toned down, which can also be because of Scott's chosen palette for the film. Otherwise is the picture quite good, but not great.  The sound is a big letdown. I would expect Universal to include a Dolby TrueHD track especially on this release, because of it's importance to Universal's HD DVD support. The sound itself is Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 and it is alright. I never feel like I am hearing the HD soundtrack, like with Batman Begins or The Matrix trilogy, but it is better than a normal DVD soundtrack, which tends to be very narrow. The sound on this release is much more open but it not the knockdown HD sound that Warner has included on the aforementioned movies and with Blade Runner.  The extra features is very meager. The extended version of the film can only be seen in the standard definition side B of the disc, which is a major letdown to all fans of the movie and HD DVD. It does have a commentary track with Scott and Steven Zaillian, the writer, which is interesting. The disc has no documentary on the making of the film, just a 4 minute long mini documentary of the real Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. Universal can really learn from Warner with it's releases of the Matrix trilogy and Blade Runner on howto properly release really great movies. It seems like Universal has gone out  it's way to release feature packed version on DVD and not on HD DVD. Has Universal lost it's confidence in HD DVD can one wonder.   And another thing. I really dislike these combo versions of a film. As I see it it's a no win situation for the consumer. A person that doesn't have a HD DVD player and buys it would be frustration because he/she payed so much for a version of the film that they cannot see before they invest in a HD DVD player. And if a person that has a HD DVD player buys it he/she feels cheated because of fact that they had to pay extra for a version of the film that they wouldn't see. And in addition there have been reported errors with them. On the disc that I have it froze halfway through the film. I restarted my player and then the playback went fine from that point.    I would still recommend this release to people who have a HD DVD player, because the film is so great and the disc isn't all that bad.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Illionois was the first Sufjan Stevens CD I had purchased.  I was so impressed with his music, I ended up buying his whole collection.  He is extremely talented and versatile.  You cannot pin him down to one type of music, but I will say he makes excellent usage of horns, and other instruments.  He has already made an excellent Michigan album, and I look forward to hearing the remaining 48 states he plans to make.

B000YDOOU0|5.0|What hits you square between the eyes on this disc is the warmth of Pat's guitar tone, his amazing telepathy & synergy with the rhythm section &, finally Sanchez' utter \\"completeness\\" as a percussionist (sorry, but this guy ain't just a \\"drummer\\", he's the complete rhythm colourist).   As for the tunes themselves, they are generally down-tempo (which makes the many intra-tune mood & rhythm changes even MORE glorious) & although not instantly \\"memorable\\" I can almost guarantee most will seep into your psyche after a few listens.  A brief track by track overview:-  Son of Thirteen: a decent opener, albeit without a memorable \\"hook\\" & perhaps a little too much of Pat's trademark \\"runs\\" before he virtually stops on a dime to comp behind a shimmering Sanchez \\"solo\\" which is well worth the wait & definitely \\"steals\\" the tune!  At last you're here:  Excellent piece worthy of repeated listens; Pat shows off a number of tricks in the jazz guitarist's armoury here (including a fantastic progression from single notes to chords which gave me goosebumps on the first listen!) plus a stunning solo from McBride with Sanchez again brilliant.  Let's move: as the title implies, probably the most \\"straight-ahead\\" tune & perhaps my least favourite for that; rhythmically & technically excellent solo from McBride.  Snova: an underlying bossa nova beat (as the title suggests) & if you close your eyes you can almost imagine the warmth of Pat's guitar tone carrying you with him across the dance floor before the bassman tries to cut in!   Incredibly evocative & romantic.  Calvin's Keys: great groove, reminiscent of early swing bands at first but then, by turns, funky, light-hearted & playful.  I reckon they must have had great fun with this tune on tour.  Listen to Sanchez' subtle & almost ever-constant rhythm changes underneath.  Easily one of my favourites here.  Is this America? (katrina 2005): Stunning & heart-rendering acoustic piece with a gorgeous bowed bass solo by McBride.  Totally compelling listening & even though I'm not even American, still brings a tear to my eye after several listens.  (Enough said).  When we were free: I'm a harsh critic of artists re-interpreting their own material on studio discs; this is undoubtedly a great tune (& I must say seems to flow-on quite naturally from \\"katrina\\") but the original (on PMG's \\"Quartet\\") was perfectly fine & although this version is thoroughly enjoyable, I don't think it fully justifies the exclusion of a \\"new\\" piece (although Sanchez does his very best to try & sway my opinion towards the end!)  Dreaming Trees: only problem with this acoustic track is that whereas \\"Is this America?\\" is 10 out of 10, this is only 9.5!. Another great solo from McBride.  The Red One: Same opening comment as for \\"When we were free\\" except here I guess Pat's doing all the guitar work himself without Sco beside him. The middle section here is significantly altered from the original (quite a reggae feel actually) & this, plus the fact that it adds a nice contrast to the other material on this disc I makes it worthy of inclusion (just!).  Day Trip: fine but kind of sterile (dare I say \\"formulaic\\") when compared to what's gone before.  In conlusion, despite my nit-picking on individual tunes here is a master at the top of his form, accompanied by a simply outstanding rhythm section (with apologies to Bill S & Larry G). Quite possibly this is the best guitar trio disc ever, not to be missed & easily 5 stars!!

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|2005's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a skillful adaptation of Jane Austen's classic romance novel to the big screen.  Only a bold production team would have taken on the task, given the continuing and justified popularity of the 1996 BBC television version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Taken on its own merits as a theatrical release, the 2005 version is visually stunning, includes wonderful location shooting and period detail, and offers two attractive leading actors with genuine on-screen chemistry.<br /><br />The storyline is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  The middle-class Bennet family, including its five eligible daughters and a scheming mother anxious to marry them off, learns that the wealthy Mr. Bingley will visit their small English village.  They meet Mr. Bingley at a village dance, where he is attracted to the beautiful and kind but reserved Jane Bennet.  Jane's spirited and headstrong sister Elizabeth is less impressed with Mr. Bingley's seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy.  Her disdain for his manners and his prejudice against Jane and against a militia officer whom she favors, will cause Elizabeth to angrily reject his surprise offer of marriage.  However, Elizabeth learns she may have been wrong about Mr. Darcy.  His generous efforts on behalf of Jane and of Elizabeth's eloped youngest sister will earn him a second chance.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is perfectly cast as the young and impertinent Elizabeth.  Matthew MacFadyen is very effective as the painfully shy and reserved Mr. Darcy.  Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are a sympathetic Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  The interaction of the Bennet sisters, including Rosamund Pike as Jane and Jena Malone as youngest sister Lydia, is authentic and by turns touching and hilarious.  Judi Dench personifies the \\"dragon\\" Lady Catherine DeBurgh.<br /><br />Adapting Pride and Prejudice to a two hour movie format means seriously compressing a treasured storyline. Under Director Joe Wright's sure hand, the movie steps briskly through the plot, keeping a tight focus on Elizabeth Bennet and her developing relationship with Mr. Darcy.  Among the key scenes: Elizabeth's chance encounter with Mr. Darcy at Pemberly; Mr. Bingley's proposal to Jane, reworked to bring out the humor and to make explicit Mr. Darcy's role; and Mr. Darcy's second proposal to Elizabeth.  The latter features a long atmospheric tracking shot as Mr. Darcy crosses a field at dawn to meet a surprised Elizabeth.  The next-to-last scene, in which Elizabeth requests permission to marry from her father, brings out the best in two very good actors.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.  The Collectors Edition DVD Set includes a music score CD, production notes, some excellent background features, and Joe Wright's fascinating director's commentary.e plot, keeping a tight focus on Elizabeth Bennet and her developing relationship with Mr. Darcy.

B00005LAGO|4.0|About a couple of weeks ago I saw a documentary on this band on ABC 2 [Australia] called, I think, \\"Pixies: Gouge\\". Previously I'd come across articles mentioning this band's influence on Nirvana [hmmm, bands which influenced Nirvana...that must be one Hell of a long list, it seems!]. Anyway, hearing snippets of songs from this band made me go out and get this album.       I'd describe this band as hardcore pop/rock/indie/alternative/punk. Which is to say that at their best, the band delivers melodic songs in a hardcore kind of way. What do I mean by \\"hardcore\\"? Topics which conventional commercial music stations would run miles from, like incest, for starters; or language-some songs have very strong swear words in them; singing which is, at times, extreme-the lead singer screeches lyrics at times. In \\"Gouge\\", lead singer 'Frank Black' mentions how an old man speaks to him after a concert and says [something like] \\"You sure can holler\\". Black knows exactly the significance of what the old man says-he's got every angle covered; lastly, the sound of the music can be hardcore at times too...grinding guitars which can thrash out songs at a breakneck pace, on occasion.       At their best, the band produces some really good pop songs, albeit unconventional ones. Kim Deal, the band's bass player [inexplicably listed as \\"Mrs John Murphy in the credits, for some reason!], is a real positive for this band. The Pixies are a band where the bass guitar doesn't hide its light under a bushel. If you like pop/rock music with bass guitar getting a look in, this is the band for you. Furthermore, Kim is a wondeful vocalist-whether taking the lead, or backing up. She has an ethereal quality to her voice. The best evidence of that is her work in the song \\"Where is my mind?\\". In that, her voice has a ghostly, haunting quality. If any horror movie makers are looking for a ghostly voice to creep people out, Kim's your woman!      Now, to the songs on this two for the price of oneoffering: my main problem with the cd was the sound-it sort of sounds digital if you know what I mean. By that I mean the sound lacks impact-if Surfer Rosa had a cleaner and purer sound to it, I'd give it 4/5. It sounds a little 'distant' in quality...as if the microphones were a little to far from the singers and instruments. For that reason I'd give that album 3.5/5. I'm giving the entire package an extra half a star for the second cd, \\"Come on Pilgrim\\", as it has a couple of tracks that I particularly like.       Best songs from the album? Well, I've had a look at the band's \\"best of\\" compilation: \\"Wave of mutilation\\", and I thought that it was missing some songs from this collection. The songs I would include in a best of from this particular cd would be: \\"Bone machine\\", \\"River Euphrates\\" [not on their actual compilation] and \\"Gigantic\\". \\"Caribou\\" [now looking at songs from \\"Come on Pilgrim\\"], \\"The holiday song\\", \\"I've been tired\\" [not on their compilation] and \\"Levitate me\\".       Although I think this band is \\"hardcore\\" in many ways, I do think that they are a fun band, with a great sense of humour...sort of schoolboyish humour [this is where my comparison with the B52s comes in]. At least I hope there is humour there...I'd hate to think that any of their songs are autobiographical! E.g. on \\"Bone machine\\", Black sings, in a sort of retarded way \\"You buy me a soda and you tried to molest me in the parking lot\\". Funny, no? Well, you gotta listen to it I suppose. In case Frank, as a small boy, was offered a soda by a Catholic priest in a parking lot, I unreservedly apologise!       In \\"River Euphrates\\", Black moves on from sounding retarded to sounding absolutely insane...and it doesn't half work effectively! This is the song I have in mind for the heading I gave this review-Sex Pistols meets B52s meets The Exorcist.         A telling comment from the docu \\"Gouge\\" came from one of the famous musicians being interviewed about the band-not sure if Bono from U2 or David Bowie made this comment, but he said words to the effect that The Pixies alternate within songs from quiet to loud, or some such. The song that best illustrates that is \\"I've been tired\\", I think. It's a quality that makes it worthy of inclusion in a \\"Best of\\" compilation. This song also mentions Lou Reed. On their later album \\"Dolittle\\", I think you can hear the influence of Lou Reed there.       If Frank Black's histrionic [at times] vocal delivery is a bit much, check out Kim Deal's turn at lead singing with \\"Gigantic\\"-a fun, 60's sounding bit of indie girl pop. And Kim is very funny when she sings on \\"Tony's theme\\"-a song about a superhero...who isn't particularly super.       There is one particularly confusing thing about this compilation-the track listings and actual tracks don't co-incide. It's clear what's going on if you check out the Amazon listing for \\"Surfer Rosa\\" itself [at least on the 2003 issue of that album]...there is a bonus track on this album-it's track 11, and is really a funny, short interlude of Frank, I think, swearing. Fortunately, for Frank, he finally says something which explains why he's talking drivel, thus alleviating the perception that he just plain mad.       As the band are often said to have influence other bands, I'll just mention some songs here which I find echoes too in other songs, or where I think the band echoes earlier music:     \\"Bone machine\\"-bluesy rhythm guitar/\\"Break my body\\"-has a 60s sound to it...sort of similar in melody to the song \\"Bus stop\\", I think that is the song I have in mind/\\"Something against you\\"-I'm guessing that The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' song \\"The impression that I get\\" was influenced by a melody in this song...this Pixies song has what sounds like a demented melody which the Bosstones' refined. This song also illustrates best the sound issues with this cd-it has a wall of noise feel to it, but the lyrics start off being barely audible. Wall of noise can be good, but you want the sound to kick you in the head, which this cd fails to do/\\"Cactus\\"-reminded me of T Rex's \\"Get it on\\"/\\"Oh my Golly\\"-Australia's indie pop/rock band The Hoodoo Gurus had \\"Wipe out\\", I think, which had a similar drum sound or pattern to this Pixie's song/\\"I'm amazed\\"-XTC's \\"Senses working overtime\\" has a similar guitar sound [dampened strumming]/\\"Brick is red\\"-reminded me of \\"Bus stop\\"?/\\"The holiday song\\" also sounded a bit 60s-ish.    A couple of the songs have Spanish lyrics, and it works well.       Having bought \\"Doolittle\\" a few days after buying this compilation [yes, this band is interesting enough to warrant further exploration of their catalogue], I can say that this cd doesn't have a \\"killer\\" track like \\"Monkey gone to Heaven\\", but it's probably stronger overall, with better \\"album\\" tracks-songs that are good, without having \\"greatness\\" stamped all over them.       If you think pop sucks, this album might ignite or re-light that fire. This is hardcore pop that demands your attention.     P.S. as I went beyond the well trodden path to find this band, can I suggest a hidden gem of a heavy metal band? Coldseed. Debut album called \\"Completion makes the tragedy\\". I think I am the only person in the world who knows this band. Like Pixies, they do a good job mixing hardcore with catchy hooks.
B0013ANMWY|3.0|This version of Jack Finney's book [[ASIN:0684852586 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]] had some promise, but ultimately missed the opportunity.  Apparently the studio didn't like the cut director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered. My suspicion is that the original film, which was completed in 2006, was probably more coherent. The Wachowski brothers were hired for massive rewriting and James McTeigue directed the new scenes. The result is a film that takes an unexpected turn for the worse.<br /><br />What's new in this rendition is that the victims of the alien virus aren't replaced by duplicates. Instead, the virus just acts within their own bodies, changing them so that they act as one organism-- we're talking a slightly nicer version of the borg from Star Trek. The idea of a more benevolent invader would have been a fresh interesting take and was where this movie was headed before the hack job. It would have been more insidiously delightful to explore the cost benefit analysis of succumbing to the invasion. No more wars, cruelty, and poverty on one side, while the stripping of a lot of what makes us human on the other-- also the collective vs. the individual. This probably would have come closer to Don Siegel's communist cold war scare overtones in the original movie [[ASIN:0782009980 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]].<br /><br />Instead the movie moves to more action sequences of fighting against a overtly hostile threat. This is where the original idea gets abandoned and the movie loses its way.<br /><br />All of the actors put in decent performances here including an admirable job by Nicole Kidman in the lead role, Daniel Craig as her love interest (an excellent new James Bond by the way), a very good cameo from Veronica Cartwright (in the 1978 remake [[ASIN:0790742462 Body Snatchers]]), Jeremy Northam as the somewhat creepy ex-husband, and Jeffrey Wright as the scientist.<br /><br /> I think the studio should take the blame for dooming a film that had some potential. It's still an enjoyable watch and worth a rental, especially for alien invasion enthusiasts.  I don't think I've ever seen a more equally distributed range of opinion by reviewers (from one to five stars). Where it all tallies out is about where I'd put it... 3 stars.<br /><br />P.S.

Toward the end, whatever your politics, you are silently pleading for the Americans to come.     As a novel the real question is how could a man have created such incredible female characters?
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter - The First Season]]<br /><br />Dexter is something that is very unique in a number of interesting ways.  It is a show that has a Serial Killer as the protagonist, and Dexter is a sympathetic character.  It is also unique in the ambiguity that exists in each episode.<br /><br />The real amount of ambiguity, and the importance of this for the show is revealed in the Audio Commentary that comes with the DVD.  I watched episode 12 (Born Free), and in the Commentary, the producers are describing the key scene where Dexter confronts the \\"Ice Truck Killer.\\"<br /><br />It was amazing to find that the producers of the show each had a completely different interpretation of what that scene meant.  I then became very aware that this is the power of the show.  Each scene is not pre-processed pablum that is pre-chewed for us.  We must participate in this show.  We need to figure out what each thing means to US.  Plot twists are not glaringly obvious miles in advance.<br /><br />For me, this is a sign of good writing.  Good writing is the foundation of any worthwhile entertainment.  The fact that this show is not pre-defined for us, with nice, neat, and \\"happy little endings\\" for each of the plot lines is what makes this show so endlessly interesting.<br /><br />The acting, and the production values are equally amazing.  The producers realized early on that Michael C. Hall had done something very different in his creation of Dexter.  The same commitment to excellence is present in every scene, from writing, to direction, to portrayals.  No one ever \\"phones it in\\" in any way.<br /><br />But enough of reviews.  You should watch episode 1.  This should make it clear that you are in for something very different.  This should let you either fall in love with Dexter the way that many of us have, or let you know that you should get out while you can.  But don't worry.  Dexter won't come for you... Unless of course you deserve to die....  Then you may find that the predator has become the prey....
B000065PUE|4.0|First, to explain my heading about \\"chocolate flavoured heroin\\"-I'm referring to the song \\"Monkey gone to Heaven\\" on this album. When I think about reviewing an album I'll jot notes for some/all of the songs and put a tick against songs I like [more if I particularly like the song]. I put a tick against \\"Monkey gone to Heaven\\", but it was sort of half-hearted...I'd seen this song listed in NME's 50 greatest indie anthems list and was maybe slightly influenced to give the song the benefit of the doubt. I did think that in the mist, there did seem to be some nice hooks in that song. Well, not sure if it was after two listens, or maybe three, those hooks, which I thought were harmless, started getting jagged deep in my body. In the two days I'd had this cd, I must have played \\"Monkey\\" dozens of times. Hence the \\"heroin/chocolate\\" comment. This song is addictive. If you do not know this song, your radio station has deprived you of something extraordinary and you should, like, sue them and stuff.       This song is pop perfection. It's The Pixies' version of The Beatles' classic \\"A day in the life\\"-by that I mean it stands as one of, if not THE best song the band has ever made. Haven't listened to a song so incessantly since I wore out the laser playing \\"What have I done to deserve this?\\" on Dusty Springfield's \\"Best of\\" compilation. This song is beautiful. It takes a little while to notice the beauty in it...the orchestral instruments-cello, piano, violin, and maybe there is even a harp in that song. And the strumming pattern of the guitar in this song is sublime too. This song is soooooooooo beautiful...like Australian Alex Lloyd's pure pop masterpiece \\"Green\\". Songs like these make you get all religiousy.      Perhaps this album best illustrates the proposition that The Pixies were an influential band. Not being a 'hip' person, I was delighted to 'discover' on one of Triple J's \\"Hottest 100\\" double cd compilations The Bloodhound Gang's hilarious and foul mouthed song \\"Fire, water, burn\\". Having bought this album a few days ago, I now know how OBVIOUS the references to \\"Monkey gone to Heaven\\" are in that later song. Sure, the Gang change one or two letters from one word in a phrase the Pixies use, but it's still the same phrase, but twisted for comedic effect. Both songs are classics. The Romantic's \\"Talking in your sleep\\" also has a very pretty guitar strumming pattern, not unlike the one in \\"Monkey\\". The one in \\"Monkey\\" is more beautifuler though.       Ok, now to the rest of the album. I'm giving it 4 stars but maybe 3.5/5 is more accurate-I'll concede that maybe I just haven't listened to this album enough and maybe songs will grow on me if I were to listen to it more, and justify the 4 stars.       I haven't really been exposed to much in the way of indie/alt pop/rock, so I'll just say that to me, this album seems more conventional than, say, \\"Surfer Rosa\\". I WOULD have said that this album is not so hardcore as that first Pixies album. But listening to this album for a second time, you have to recognise that it does have hardcore elements...it's just that they are masked by the more conventional 'poppyness' of the sound. E.g. \\"Wave of mutilation\\" isn't exactly gagging to get played on commercial radio, right? And \\"Debaser\\" has a truly horrific lyric-I actually misheard the actual lyric but my mondegreen was no less horrifying than the actual lyric-both ugly alternatives in any case. The other day I revisited an article about this band and there is an explanation for this lyric-it concerns a very old movie with a certain special effect. The lead singer, Frank Black, is apparently referring to this movie. I've seen the scene on tv occasionally, and it is no less disturbing for being filmed before the age of realistic special effects. If this song's lyrics had been in a heavy metal song, I'd have dismissed the song out of hand. Being bound up in this demented pop ALMOST makes it like art-challenging, if not uncomfortable. [On the subject of metal-in the same way I feel deprived for not having heard \\"Monkey\\" sooner, I'm staggered that the beautiful song \\"Fade to black\\" by Metallica has never really seen the light of day on commercial radio in Australia. Our loss.]      Browsing this band's compilation \\"Wave of mutilation\\", I see that one song that should be an automatic selection for such an album, \\"I bleed\\", is not there. Lead singer Frank sounds like Lou Reed on this song [echoing back to \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and the song \\"I've been tired\\"]. Black and female bassist Kim Deal combine wonderfully on this laid back song-Deal has a very haunting, ethereal quality to her voice and she's nicely creepy on this song. One thing you can't say about Pixies is that they hide the bass player under a bushel. As always, the bass is where the action is with this band. Not sure if this perception is correct, but maybe Deal has been dealt out of a major vocal contribution to the songs...she doesn't take the lead vocal duties like she did on \\"Surfer\\" with \\"Gigantic\\". Perhaps she is being underutilised on this album as a mere backing singer? She does that duty well, in any case. Just btb, this song has a guitar part which avowed Pixies fans \\"Radiohead\\" seem to have used, after nicely refining it, for \\"Creep\\". Radiohead are on the Pixies' documentary \\"Gouge\\", among other musicians of note, like U2's Bono and David Bowie. Watching that docu made me go out and buy \\"Surfer Rosa\\"-as well as review that album here a few minutes ago.       Of the rest of album, the songs that are next best for me are:  \\"Silver\\"-it has a sort of demented Country song feel to it...slide guitar, vocals with a Spiritual vibe to them, and Frank complementing Kim's vocals with his own falsetto. Sort of \\"Man of constant sorrow\\" territory for this song.       If people criticise this album for being more pop than alt pop, they may have songs like \\"Here comes your man\\". Since I LOVE pop, I have to say that this song is one of the betterones on this album. It has a cheesy bass melody and, like much of this album, is more indie pop than the band's earlier alternative pop.       Some other interesting songs from the aspect of influences are:  \\"Tame\\"-where Frank sort of sounds like a muppet and has a terrific breathy quality to his voice...in fact, he seems to channel the still alive Rolf Harris with his \\"eefing and eiffing\\" vocal trick. This song is also another example where Black sounds completely insane at times-some parts of Pixies songs are pure Bedlam, vocals wise.       \\"Dead\\"-I haven't heard too much of The White Stripes, but what I have heard suggests to me that maybe they listened to this song before they started making music. It's got that kind of drumming sound and simplicity to it. One time Aussie indie rock messiahs, The Vines, had a song called \\"Ride with me\\"-that had a catchy drum sound to it. Pixies were always experimenting with sound and tempos etc.       \\"Crackity Jones\\"-punkish/thrash pop with screeching.       \\"La la love you\\"-cheesy song, singing wise, which perhaps has an echo, melody wise, with The Cures' song \\"Let's go to bed\\".       Lastly-did I tell you about \\"Monkey gone to Heaven\\"? No? Well, it's great. Frank has such evangelical zeal in one part of that song-the part that my heading for this review references: \\"5,6,7\\". Sure, you could say that the lyrics are silly, but the music is so great you don't nitpick. In fact, the lyrical weirdness of this band is a strength. I have no idea what Black is talking about with those numbers, but he sounds sure of himself. His logic is inescapable...I'm sure he has discovered some eternal truth in the significance of these numbers...if only we had someone to tell us how to live now.        Anyway, this album is more conventional in sound, but, make no mistake, the band is still hardcore and not desperate to be liked by the mainstream radio stations. They made their bed-it should hardly be surprising that a great pop song like \\"Monkeygone to Heaven\\" is perhaps largely unknown amongst the ordinary punter. That is a crime.       As always, Pixies wrap challenging and confronting lyrics into, this time, some sublime pop.
B000P12LWY|5.0|The 1st year of the Tudors show from Showtime on 2 high-quality DVDs. It also has some nice extras about the cast, Tudor locations in the UK, etc. The story lines are interesting. Although some liberties are taken with historical facts to add to their entertainment value, the dvds still give one a sense of the age and the people in it. There is at least one sex scene in each show, but not too explicit for most - just some partial nudity. The acting is top notch, and the story is entertaining.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|One day late (ordered it for Thursday and arrived on Friday instead.) I prefer the music from Toxicity than from Mesmerize. On this CD is Toxicity type music, logical lyrics with very few swears and barely any full out unintelligible yelling. I enjoyed this CD.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This movie provides an extensive, persuasive introduction to the provision of health care in the United States, as screwed up and balkinized as it has become.  I found most persuasive the parts that discuss the problems of our system as detailed by purveyors of it, including physicians, customer service associates, and patients.  It brings to the forefront that the health care problem in this country is not just a matter of the uninsured, but involves the insured as well.<br /><br />Solutions to this problem will not come in the current election cycle.  Citizens should advocate for a system that treats each person's health as a human right, since the inability to maintain individual health, regardless of circumstance, will ultimately be our downfall as a advanced society.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|My sister warned not to watch this version as it would only upset me and she was right. As it is, it's taken four attempts to get all the way through. I can understand the difficulties in turning a detailed book into a movie but surely you can remain true to the characters? Emma Thompson did it with style, an obvious love for the story and great actors. Jane has a following guaranteed to bring a crowd, and Hollywood took advantage. If you love BBC's version you'll hate this.
B00005JPUN|2.0|Nicole Kidman stars as a psychiatrist who notices her patients, her secretary and the rest of the town seems to be acting like emotionless zombies. Together with her doctor boyfriend, they discover an alien lifeform is altering humanity making us more like them. Can she rescue her son, who seems to have a strange immunity to the sickness, or is she destined to join the legion of infected?<br /><br />I was disappointed in this film. I liked the original novel, and this just seemed sort of blah. I never really felt Nicole's character was in jeopardy and I felt she made an unconvincing parent. She seemed physically wrong for the role. She is way overly botoxed/plastic surgered so that her face is like a stretched plastic balloon. Yek.  The alien method of contaminating other victims (via projectile vomiting) seemed kind of juvenile. Meh. Overall, this was a limp, lame film, worthy of the sci-fi channel. I would rent if you must, but not buy.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|I'll start by saying that Phil Collins is one of the singularly most talented humans on the planet.  I still marvel at his incredibly diverse set of talents.  I know I should critique this CD more harshly because it's lacking the nuclear powered energy of 3-Sides Live and Seconds Out, but my god, it's flat out amazing what they still can do and how Phil Collins still has perfect pitch even now.  I love this album despite the lack of \\"something\\", but to be fair, they're not what they used to be. Twist my arm and I'll say that the worst song on the album is \\"turn it on again\\" - which compared to 3-sides live, is lifeless.  Also, I somehow got the impression that Phil Collins was getting lyrics from a teleprompter.  However, I still love Genesis and always will.  I'm thrilled to have new Genesis to enjoy and I simply can't dislike this CD.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is an imaginative, brilliantly acted and beautifully produced movie about a quest to find a newly fallen star (who in the kingdom of Wall is in the form of a human girl), taken from the sky by a gemstone necklace set on finding the heir to the throne of the kingdom.  Now I won't get into too much detail here so those of you who haven't seen it yet can fully enjoy every scene, but let's just say Stardust is not only humorous and surprising in parts, but wonderfully packaged as a whole.  The list of amazing actors here only add to the star appeal, and you'll find not a wrong turn in this movie.  They've chosen the perfect crop of talent to succeed, and Stardust does succeed--every time.  Highly recommended to anyone.

B000063JZQ|4.0|This is an excellent interpretation of Shakespeare's play. The producer managed to liven-up the action and the play appeared much more lifelike. It is an excellent version to show to your students in any English Literature class. The ending, where Macbeth was beheaded and his head stuck upon the stake on the castle walls, was graphic and for the first time, the boys in the class watched a Shakespearean play to the end. The action scenes were fast paced and interesting and the witches were well made up. I like the fact that Macbeth and his wife were depicted as young ambitionus characters because it appeared much more relevant in their pursuit of power. It is an excellent depiction of the play and I would recommend it to any Literature teacher.

B000WS4QJG|1.0|The Curmudgeon never has been, nor ever will be, what you would call a major Michael Jackson fan but there really is no denying that, before the baby dangling and kiddie fiddling antics and the frightening plastic surgery and, well, everything else that turned him into an off-putting laughing stock, before all that - Michael Jackson was quite simply one of the greatest pop stars on the planet. Innovative, exciting, mysterious - basically everything that absolutely NO pop star is nowadays. Jackson really did seem like he came from some fantastic alternative universe, creating some jaw dropping, magnificent pop records - Thriller being one of them.<br /><br />So it comes as absolutely no shock that one of the all-time essential albums gets a 25th anniversary edition. Quite as to WHY we really need another edition, when you consider that it was re-released as a Special Edition a few years back, not to mention the fact that every single was re-released only last year - really Mike, how much longer do you expect your glassy-eyed, weirdo obsessive fans to buy the same music time and time again?<br /><br />Anyway, you're probably wondering WHY Thriller, one of the greatest albums of all time, from one of the greatest pop stars of all time, is sitting alongside the very worst Amazon has to offer in the Curmudgeon's reviews?<br /><br />Because, not only is it a cheap cash in, not only is it unwarranted, not only is it MISSING actual album tracks from the previous Special Edition, but because the main selling point here isn't Thriller itself - more the \\"previously un-released\\" (read - knocked up about a week ago) bonus tracks, featuring remixes and covers from such luminaries as Will.I.Am and Fergie.<br /><br />Are you scared yet?<br /><br />Gentle reader, you SHOULD be.

B000002HH2|5.0|The one thing that could and probably must be said about Bjork's music is that it is otherworldly.  Listening to anything produced by the uber-talented Icelandic beauty (yes I said beauty; her childish and slightly impish features are exotic to me) is like a slow slide into a land unfamiliar to most humans.  Bjork is in a league all her own and creates music she wants to create, music she is passionate about it that resonates on every track on this album.  She cannot be pigeonholed for there is nothing she won't attempt.  This can be seen full throttle in her sophomore album `Post', an album rich with unique and original concepts that elevate Bjork above just about everyone else.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice about `Post' is that it possesses a little more edge than her debut album `Debut'.  The first track off the album is `Army of Me' and it is sic with heavy bass and almost eerie undertones.  I relish this side of Bjork, her darker more untamed side.  `Army of Me' is one of the most memorable tracks here for the beat alone will get stuck in your skin.  Along these same musical lines is `Enjoy', a track that is extremely `enjoyable'.  This style suits Bjork magically; her voice and her style is personified by the techno laden beats.<br /><br />But this is not all Bjork has in store for us.<br /><br />Taking us away from the rave and into a different kind of club atmosphere Bjork takes advantage of the techno beats to create more up-tempo tracks; much like `Hyper-Ballad' which is just that, a hyper ballad.  The song starts off sweet and sincere, Bjork's flaw vocals adding layers of emotional depth to the lyrics, and then it explodes hyper-intensity that is joyous and boisterous.  This same energy is seen in `I Miss You', a track that almost has a Latin flare to it with the tribal sounding bongos and horns forming a sturdy back-beat.  You can tell that Bjork is having a lot of fun with this song.<br /><br />`The Modern Things' is a good transitioning between the up-tempo techno beats and the sensitive ballad.  It's a brilliantly constructed track and leads us into Bjork's next musical adventure...<br /><br />The ballad.<br /><br />Two tracks; `You've Been Flirting Again' and `Cover Me', are short and to the point, graceful and delicate in their delivery and give us yet another layer to the talent that is Bjork.  `Cover Me' is such a beautiful addition to the album, adding Oriental flare to the track with the classic strings caressing the track magically.  It's short, but it's meaningful.  `Isobel' has classical orchestral inspiration and it magnificently merges this influence with an almost tribal backdrop.  `Possibly Maybe' is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  It's brimming with an intense sensuality that I didn't expect.  It's soft and delicate and very inviting.  It feels warm; if that makes sense.<br /><br />But Bjork isn't finished yet...<br /><br />If anyone has been privilidged to see `Dancer in the Dark' (I say privileged mainly because the film alone is flawless) then you have experienced Bjork in full on `musical' mode.  She gives us an early taste of this with `It's Oh So Quiet', a track that feels like a Broadway number.  It's lively and imaginative and perfectly constructed and delivered.  Bjork knows what she's doing and it shows.  Not only is it technically flawless but her heart is in it and that elevates it to new heights.<br /><br />The closing track `Headphones' feels in a way like an emotional crash for Bjork.  This is a good thing.  The song is almost stagnant, with no real shifts in pitch but it manages to display emotion quite adequately.  As the song begins you can feel an almost draining on the part of Bjork.  It's a beautiful effort on her part and closes out the album spectacularly.<br /><br />`Post' is one of Bjork's finest albums and is a far more complete and collected album then her phenomenal debut album `Debut'.  She has mastered her vision and delivers it in such a beautifulpackage that we can be nothing short of stunned by her growth.  Like I have said before and will continue to say; Bjork is not for everyone, but anyone can see that this girl is talented beyond compare.  Even if you are not drawn to her musical style you at least must admit that she is one of the most original acts in music today, and that alone is a triumph.said before and will continue to say; Bjork is not for everyone, but anyone can see that this girl is talented beyond compare.

0007107927|2.0|A young man searches for an effective manager because he wants to work for one and become one. When he discovers a nearby manager, the young man visits him. When the young man asks the manager what type of manager he is, the manager alleges that he is a One Minute Manager. The young man wants to learn more, so the manager arranges for him to talk to three of his people.    The first person that the young man talks to is Mr. Trenell. Mr. Trenell explains to the young man the first secret of One Minute Management: One Minute Goal Setting. One Minute Goal Setting requires one to set goals that would take a minute to read, and then see if the individual's behavior matches his/her goals.    The second person that the young man talks to was Mr. Levy. Mr. Levy explains to the young man the second secret of One Minute Management: One Minute Praisings. One Minute Praisings requires one to tell people in person specifically what they are doing right, encourage them to do more of the same, and leave a positive feeling about their progress.    The third person that the young man talks to is Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown explains to the young man the third secret of One Minute Management: One Minute Reprimand. One Minute Reprimand requires one to tell people specifically what they are doing wrong, but attacking the behavior of the individual, not the individual himself/herself. Afterward, remind the individual that they are a good person.    As you can see, the book merely tells you that an effective manager will set goals, and give praising and reprimands--and nothing more. If you like to read novels, this doesn't cut it neither. It qualifies more as a short story. You can read it in about half hour, so don't waste your money on this book. You can just walk over to your local bookstore and sit down for  30 minutes, and leave having read a semi-interesting short story.
0375842209|5.0|Markus Zusak has given us an exquisite novel of Germans who did not subscribe to Hitler's teachings.  Through the character of Liesel Meminger he weaves an achingly accurate story of what happened to Germans who chose not only to follow their own consciences but also to help the Jews.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Death, an original concept, and Death is not the Grim Reaper you might imagine, but a compassionate entity that is charged with the unhappy task of carrying lost souls to eternity and must focus on the beauty of the colors rather than on the gruesome task at hand.  Death is haunted by humans and the reader will undoubtedly be haunted by these magnificently created characters.  From her foster parents, Hans and Rosa, to her best friend Rudy and to Max, the Jewish man hidden in her basement, the characters will come alive and burn in the reader's memory.  They are fully defined and unforgettable in their passion and their sorrow.<br /><br />Abandonment is a central theme in the novel as young Liesel (only nine when she is taken to live with a foster family) loses both her mother and brother in the early pages but has even more tragedies to befall her as the story moves on.  This is a story of her courage and friendship, her love and her grief, as Death watches over her life on Himmel Street in suburban Munich.  Bombings and death marches are common, but Liesel's obsession with stealing books and how she uses the words in them is the heart of this novel.  Books become her friend, stealing them her obsession, and she finds in them the power to not only survive but to help those around her.<br /><br /> In an interview, the author explained why he made Liesel a book thief.  He said, \\"I made Liesel be a book thief because words were so important in that time. Hitler destroyed people with words, he stole their minds, and Liesel kind of steals the words back, and some of the people. She steals Max back by sharing stories with him, and she makes people human again by reading to them in the shelters, by connecting with them. So it's like she steals the words back and rewrites a beautiful story through the ugly world that surrounds her.\\"<br /><br />.m in the shelters, by connecting with them.

The movie has the qualities of a documentary, but the main reason I bought it is that my 17-year old son has been lifting weights for about one year and is really getting into it. After seeing this movie, he's more \\"pumped up\\" &lt;G> than ever! And so am I!! I've been working out for about 7 weeks quite intensively, and now I want to work out even harder. This is a must see for anyone who can use that extra dose of motivation.
B000EK76K8|3.0|FYI, as of this writing, you can get this directly from Apple for $19.00 + $4 S&H.  A better deal than shown here.<br /><br />Oh, and you'll probably need another cord for any practical use.  I hooked it up w/ this [[ASIN:B000E8SY5Q Eforcity Black 2 Meter HDMI Male to DVI Male Cable]] and now can use my HDTV as a 2nd monitor.  Very cool.<br /><br />Don't know why Apple doesn't just build in a regular DVI output or include this adapter.  (Maybe to make more money?)
B0000C7PQK|4.0|My only real \\"un-favorite\\" Enigma album.  Good for relaxation, but it seemed to me this was just a \\"well, we need to put out an album\\" sort of thing.  I have mixed feelings about this album.  It's the only one I don't listen to frequently, but it is Enigma.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol's career started with the punk band Generation X in the late-70's early-80's. He than hit it big with his self-titled debut in 1982, which features one of his biggest hits, 'White Wedding.'    On this comprehensive collection, you get 16 of Idol's finest, plus 71 minutes of music. That's an excellent deal for the price.    'Rebel Yell,' 'White Wedding,' 'Mony Mony,' 'Eyes Without A Face,' 'Cradle of Love,' and a great live acoustic version of 'Rebel Yell' all appear on this collection to make up his greatest hits.    This rock icon's finest is represented here. A very enjoyable collection, and if your new to Billy Idol or just a casual fan, you'll really like this CD. There is not a single flaw with this disc.     So buy it and enjoy. Highly recommended!
B00009MGGI|5.0|Government without corruption is boring theatre...in truth, a fantasy.  House of Cards/To Play the King portrays the power of curruption in governmental affairs with endearingly royal, exquistely satirical sniffs, uproariously relevant and timeless.  Smashing theatre!  Perfectly smashing!
B000W00Y0O|5.0|Great HD picture and sound. Queen's songs and performance captured vividly. Next best thing to being there!
B000002URV|5.0|If you need to relax, put this in.  This is some of the best music to relax or meditate to.  I actually first heard this from my college roommate.  He was into martial arts and would play this as he did his thing.  So, if you've had a hard day, put this in and instantly relax.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Why does this album continue to fire our imaginations?  Why do people still talk about it like it was made yesterday?  Why is it one of the great classic albums?  Why does it still inspire people today?  No one has ever come up with a substantial explanation.  I can't either.  All I know is that I adore this album.  Every note, word, guitar lick, drum part, keyboard, vocal, etc., etc..<br /><br />It's a sad, depressing album at times, dark and brooding.  It's not exactly #1 album material.  But it has had the most staying power of any album EVER.  It's undeniably beautiful, powerful, and a grand work of art.  Enough said....
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|This movie was so weak. Jerry Seinfeld, who I love, is the main character. Unfortunately, his humor didn't carry the movie for me. He plays a bee who becomes obsessed with the knowledge that humans are taking all their hard made honey. He goes to court and wins all the honey back. As a result, the bees stop working, flowers aren't pollinated, everything on the planet is dying.<br /><br />So what is the moral? Is it wrong to steal others work, is it wrong to sue, is it wrong to relax when all the work has already been done? There were just a lot of confusing messages and very few positives.<br /><br />It was a depressing movie with an ugly court case, like we needed another one of those. I have no desire to ever see this movie again.
B000NIBUQW|5.0|This is a great movie for a great price.  It's kind of a tear jerker.  Will Smith and his son have an outstanding performance.
B00005OMTT|5.0|The Best o' Enigma.  My only complaint is the glaring omission of \\"Why\\".  From day 1, Mike \\"MC\\" Cretu captured me with this weird combo of club dance/religious/whatever music.  If you are new to Enigma, pick this up.  If you are familiar with Enigma, pick this up.  It does not disappoint.
B00104W8T6|5.0|i loved the music when i saw the movie and couldn't wait to get the cd.  i rarely buy cd, but i love it and listen to it everyday!
B000ZLFALI|2.0|The two lonely stars go to the small batch of songs which hit the mark (Hey Jude, Blackbird, and others). Unfortunately, these are minor high points within a choppy mess of a plot, truly pointless characters, and song renditions which at their lowest point are simply awful.    Aside from the uninspiring love story, the biggest culprit here is the movie's obsession with forcing a Beatles song into every possible scene - a music-desperate scheme which quickly shoves good storytelling aside for the sole sake of adding more and more disjointed song renditions.    Take, for example, the Prudence character, who stands out like a sore thumb throughout the movie, yet provides absolutely nothing of value to the story, since her sole purpose in the movie is so that somebody, at some point, can sing Dear Prudence.    In essence, this heavy, song-obsessive system permeates the whole movie, and leaves any possible sense of plot feeling empty, forced and detached of emotion.    The soundtrack may hold decent surprises for some, but this 2 hr. 10 min. \\"love story\\" is excessively long and just a flat-out disappointment.     I'll stick to my Beatles CDs for some real inspiration.
B000TGELLY|5.0|this movie was originally pretty good, but the director's cut adds so much more depth and insight into the characters that it makes this dvd one of the best deals on amazon.
B000002U6E|5.0|Much as I love all the Enigma albums, this is my favorite.  It is just so different from all the others, especially the debut.  They went eastern with this.  More Middle Easternish sounding, but we'll call it \\"eastern\\".  Like the debut, a good album to relax to.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I got the SB-400 after I got the 18-200mm lens because the lens casts a shadow at 18mm when you use the built-in flash because of it's wider built (compared to the kit lens).  The SB-400 is pretty amazing.  The exposures it takes are spot-on most of the time, plus you get the ability to bounce the flash.  The only thing I wished it could do is to bounce sideways too, but otherwise an excellent accessory for my D40.
B000YA82F6|2.0|First of all, is there anyone else who hated this film with a vengeance? I certainly did. You would think that after all the glowing reviews, the film would at least be a three star spectacle. But no. At best, this is like an independent film with a very 'witty' screenwriter, without whom there would possibly be no film at all.<br /><br />My main problem is the script - no one in real life will ever talk like this. Its just not possible. We are so obsessed as a society with pop culture, that when somebody talks like a pop culture encyclopedia, we find it 'cool' and 'funky'. Well, that only makes it even more pathetic. Every line that comes out of Juno's mouth seems like it was written by a mid-30s pop-culture geek, and it makes her performance seem so stilted and artificial. Not to mention just plain bad.<br /><br />The supporting cast was equally bad. Its bad enough that the tepid lead actress here was nominated for an Oscar (seriously, who nominates these talentless wannabes for the big awards?), the guy playing her boyfriend was especially irritating. Everyone sounds as if they just attended a Gilmore Girls convention, trying to stuff movie and music references into every other sentence they spoke. Roger Ebert inexplicably gave this film four stars, and totally lost my respect in the process.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" at the end, is just a plain bad film. The movie ends with a contrived scene of Juno and her boyfriend sitting on the steps of a house, banging out a ballad possibly conceived of in indie hell. The soundtrack, while average has one main song (the opening credits) that I found particularly bad.<br /><br />How films like this get great reviews is beyond me. Reading the five star reviews on this page really makes me wonder. As a lover of world cinema and indie films in general, I found this film to be a total abomination, and everything that is wrong with filmmaking in totality.<br /><br />Two Generous Stars - and both for the luminous Jennifer Garner who belongs in a much better film than this one..
0805028846|5.0|No, this book doesn't have luscious designs for you to copy & make.    What it does have that makes it a superior book on the subject are logical. easy to understand directions on how to design & make your own versions. This book also alerts you to problems that might appear if you ignore underlying structural mechanics.    Of the books I own on this subject, this one has been the springboard that has allowed me to design my own successful and creative pop-ups.    If you want to make someone else's designs, this isn't the book for you. If you want to express yourself using imaginative pop-ups that are your own designs -- and that work -- then I recommend this book!
B000YA82F6|4.0|As the father of a son, Juno's pregnancy is the reason that I live in mortal fear of having a daughter.  But the rest of Juno is the reason I am so curious about the possibility.  I would love nothing more than to have a smart, worldly, interesting, quirky daughter.  The foul-mouthed part I could do without, but if all the rest were there I would hope the language would work itself out eventually.    Juno is funny.  Incredibly so in parts.  But it's also a great deal more.  Her relationship with her father and step-mother seems at first blush to be the height of dysfunction.  But as you watch, it becomes brilliant.  For every \\"Did you throw up in my vase\\" moment, there is a touching exchange or enlightening blow-up (such as the step-mother's explosion at the ultrasound technician).      But even more remarkable than the way my opinion of the family changed is how my opinion of Juno changed.  I start out thinking, \\"Wow, dumb kid for skipping the condom.\\"  Then I moved to, \\"Wow, this kid is way too smart to have forgotten the condom.\\"  And finally I ended up on, \\"Wow, this dumb smart kid is a perfect example of recovering well from a mistake.\\"  In short, I ended up with respect for the character and the movie.  I went to laugh and did, but I also came away touched.
0312370830|4.0|Sarah´s Key is an interesting, well written book, with fictitious characters but based on real historical events.  It is a book you cannot miss (although I did not quite expect such an ending to the story)I recommend it to everyone.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|The film started off by sort of shocking me into watching, as if I wasn't supposed to be watching it yet I was completely drawn to it. By the end of the movie, this film about and with live sex really left me feel full of love and positivity.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is Enya's best work. Her lyrics and music always touch your heartstrings. Romantic and happy with a touch of melancholy. Flora's Song makes me think of skipping through fields of flowers. This CD flows perfectly.
0525950079|5.0|Follett does an excellent job melding an interesting story line with detailed descriptions of the life and these dark times in history.
B00008438V|5.0|How can this film be so good?   There are crude sexual references and obvious pandering to the adolescent male sex obsessed ego thru out this film.    Amazingly these never seem to detract from how good it is.   Laugh out loud funny, surprisingly interesting \\"takes\\" on many serious ideas and of course Kelley Lebrock at the very height of her \\"Woman in Red\\" beauty.   This could easily be mistaken for a bit of bathroom fluff, it is that, but also it is much more.   It makes it's points with brilliant visual humor and razor sharp dialogue.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This DVD is wonderful. It is the best movie version that I've seen of this book. I recommend it 100%.
B000MP0XIW|5.0|Is the United states \\"dollar\\" that worthless these days, that it isn't worth the cost to release such a title in the US? Sad times indeed! This is a \\"region 2\\" (non-USA) release which will NOT play on standard US dvd players in America... UNLESS you have the right info;    Do your research and search Google for DVD region code hacks, or unlock codes. You may find that it's a very easy task to unlock your current DVD player to play disks from ANYWHERE in the world. In fact, many DVD players simply require a special code that you input from the remote control! That's right, just press a few buttons on your remote and you can watch DVD's from \\"ANY region\\"!!! Also, this is FREE information, NEVER pay anyone for an unlock code!    There are also VERY cheap \\"all region players\\" that sell here on Amazon for around $30! The PHILIPS DVP3140 is one such player. Do your research and free yourself from this horrible situation!    Also, make sure you VOTE this election. It's time to get America back on the right track (and restore the value of the dollar and America's reputation around the world)! Not to mention, take care of our own citizens!    I'm not telling you WHO to vote for, just get out there and VOTE!!!    JM
0805066691|5.0|\\"Bury my Heart\\" is without out a doubt one of the most educational yt sad books that I have ever read. However sad and disgusting the facts are, though, the book should be required reading in every single high school U.S. History class.
B000EAT246|4.0|Roy Scheider passed away on February 10, 2008. He was an actor who's presence always added greatly to any production. This is certainly the case with Blue Thunder, which would have had less of an impact without his performance.    The 80's were a great time for big \\"B-MOVIES\\". Blue Thunder plays like an episode of the A-Team or Knight Rider on steroids. If you like your action films with an 80's \\"escapist\\" style, then Blue Thunder will deliver the goods.    Those who are put off by nudity or strong language may be surprised by some of the content. So be warned if you have only seen the edited TV version.    If you enjoy this film, seek out the short lived TV series, also available on DVD. The character of Frank Murphy (Scheider) is replaced by Frank Chaney (James Farentino). The Character of Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern) was changed to Clinton Wonderlove (Dana Carvey, in an early starring role).    Make sure you get this \\"special edition\\" and not the older DVD version. Lots of good special features!    JM
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Don't call this metal, this is rock in its purest form, made for adults.  I could listen to this album every day and never get tired of it.  The production is flawless.  It's too bad more people don't know about the greatness of Mastodon, but maybe it's better that way.  I suppose if you're scared off by a little bit of yelling and a whole lot of face melting, there are other bands/albums for you.  But again, don't call this metal, because when people hear 'metal' they think of metallica and megadeth and iron maiden.  those are all good bands and stuff but frankly Mastodon makes them sound like little girls.  Sorry, that's just the truth.  Mastodon rocks harder than anything else and their lyrics and melodies are killer.
032147404X|5.0|I loved this book. It talks about equipment which is very overwhelming for beginners, discusses different shots, and many other useful information. I loved the book!
B0009A21R6|4.0|After reading a review above I realized my copy of 'brothers in arms' is a dvd-a issue and will therefore have to purchase the sacd version to confirm to myself that sacd is a better system of top end sound. I have both a sacd & dvd-a player and seldom if ever utilize the dvd-a system. Both are wired for direct multi-channel connections, so there is no processing done by the reciever(onkyo tx-sr-800) and I have found the sacd to be vastly superior to the dvd system. This will help confirm if my feelings are true or not.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|I'm an American Woman who absolutely fell in love with this movie. I bought the movie at the suggestion of a friend, who said this movie would show a true depiction of life in Jamaica.     My boss was not too happy that I viewed this movie because she always has something negative to say about American blacks as she calls us, like the black youths stand out on the streets doing nothing then go to jail. I asked her who fills the jails of Jamaica? Jamaicans...Who fills the jails in China? Chinese, so why is it so frowned upon that Blacks are in American Jails?     When young people or people in general are not giving the right opportunities, they will find a way to survive whether it's on the mean streets of America, Jamaica, or Africa.    I am looking forward to the sequel to Shottas!!! And hope many more movies come out that celebrate the rich heritage of Jamaica!!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is a must see Season 3 DVD...like usual it will keep you on edge!!!
B000YENUIQ|5.0|This was a great movie at the theatres, and it was equally great watching in HD at home.  Great acting from Watts and Viggo.  A really intense fight scene at the baths.  The transer looks pretty good.  A Caveat though: As firm a believer of HD DVD at the beginning I am starting to have doubts about the format as I see Warner, Netflix, etc coming around to the BluRay camp and I wonder whether I will end up with a whole bunch of HD DVDs in a BluRay world.  Oh well...
B000HIVOI2|3.0|The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because it's still a great story.  The quality of the Blu-Ray was less than marginal.  I was expecting a lot considering how many advertisements I had seen about this release on Blu-Ray.  The whole movie to me was very grainy.  I felt as if I was watching the movie as a kid on my old 19\\" Quasar TV when it was first released.  The only plus out of the whole purchase was that I bought the movie for half the price it would have cost at a Retail Store like Worst Buy.
B00005J8JI|2.0|The music gets 5 stars. Let's face it-(ALL ZEPPELIN MUSIC GETS 5 STARS)! This particular packaging(mini lp)gets 5 stars. There is no new remastering here, so I take away 2 stars. There are no \\"extra tracks\\", like on the \\"CODA\\" disc in the \\"Complete Studio Recordings\\" box set. So, minus 2 more stars. Then, I just HAVE to give back 1 star, again, for the packaging! Sorry, but in mho, mini lp packaging should have been the industry standard, from the beggining!
B00066R4T8|4.0|Dispite some views of other readers, I feel that this book was an amazingly detailed and heartfelt account of Joe Simpson's amazing struggle for survival and Simon Yates' unflinching support and heroism when placed in a certain death situation.   Though heavy in detail and mountaineering lingo,(which a glossary is provided in the back of the book) this book tells not only a story of climbing one of the most dangerous first accents in the Peruvian Andes but does it in a manner in which can make you feel the heartfelt passion both climbers have for their sport. This accompanied with the misery and pain that is scarily discribed, gives insight to what is common place for climbers above 20,000 ft.  This book gives and indepth look at not only the sport of mountaineering but the emotions,physical,mental, and personal pain that can be endured by the human body and will. For those who have not read this book are surely missing out on one of the greatest adventuring climbing epics of all time, and those that have, are surely not to forget.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Just saw the play and really needed the music.  Amazon delivery was prompt, cd quality excellent
B00006JQU1|5.0|I've searched for years and my search is over.  I could not argue a single note, a single phrase of this utterly marvelous, amazingly perfect performance.  I'm certain Bach is finally happy in his grave upon this release.  Brava, Ms. Podger!
B000RF7XZI|2.0|It's one thing to amuse yourself imagining how \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" might have come to be written for a film like \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" - it's another thing entirely simply to rewrite existing history so you can turn that history into a palatable soap opera for morons.    Despite a lush production, great costumes, and a cast that is nothing short of extraordinary, the liberties taken with recorded history by the director take this film down to the level of a cartoon of Elizabeth's achievements during Britain's Golden Age.  Had I seen this in the theater, I would probably have gotten up and walked out after seeing Mary de Guise murdered in her bed by Sir Francis Walsingham for the sake of \\"compressing\\" history and the personae of Mary de Guise and her daughter, Mary Queen of Scots.  Mary de Guise was deposed by her own nobles in 1559, and died of dropsy in 1560 - she represented next to no threat to Elizabeth (quite the reverse: the rise of Scottish Protestantism was a threat to Mary de Guise). Her daughter Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded by Elizabeth many years later after quite a long time spent imprisoned in the Tower.  Only the presence of actors like Blanchett, Rush, and Eccleston kept me watching. Then there was the presentation of the young Elizabeth as wavering and tentative and easily cowed, when in fact one of the factors in her survival of a very dangerous youth was her composure, brilliant mind, and oratorical gifts; and, most absurdly, a wildly erotic sex scene between Fiennes and Blanchett in an open space where her ladies in waiting (and anyone else who cared to) enjoyed the spectacle, a piece of recklessness so out of character for the wily, man-dodging Elizabeth that it beggars description.    I was the more disgusted because, knowing how appallingly badly educated Americans are when it comes to history (more than half of teens polled recently couldn't give the dates of the Civil War), I am sure three quarters of the audiences in this country walked outthinking that they had just been shown the truth.    There is NO excuse for this.  NONE.  I see from the ecstatic reviews that most people either don't know any better or worse, just don't care - it is a sad commentary on their standards.  I wonder if the director had a good time trying to cut down to size one of history's greatest female leaders?    For the record, Blanchett is splendid as the young Elizabeth, Joseph Fiennes decent but uninspiring (as he always seems to be) as the feckless Sir Robert Dudley, Geoffrey Rush amazing (as HE always seems to be) as the canny Walsingham, and Christopher Eccleston baleful and forbidding as the Catholic Duke of Norfolk, sworn to bring down what he considers a heretic and illegitimate Queen (the Norfolks still lead England's minority Catholic nobility).  Daniel Craig has a small role in this film as one of Norfolk's co-conspirators in treason - as always, Craig is compelling to watch even briefly.  I find Joseph Fiennes so dull; what a pity neither Craig nor Eccleston were cast as Dudley.    But what a stunning waste of immense talent on a script that is absolute trash.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|The third of the Bourne movies is a stellar experience.  It's a near-non-stop rush of surprise after surprise and intrigue after intrigue.  Matt Damon is passionate yet contained -- fighting for his life and the preservation of his name.  Recommend it highly!!
B00003CXCT|4.0|It was great to buy this set it has all updated scenes that really make the movies shine.    Some of the new scenes might be offensive to the Purist, but I think they really add to the flavor of the films and tie in better with the other 3 movies.  I now have all 6 movies in Widescreen and can sit down and watch them all in one sitting if I feel like it!  I had a problem with my first set, 2 of the discs were corrupted, but I sent it back, and Amazon sent out another set that was fine.
B000W4KT64|4.0|another high-school musical. Nikki Blonsky as Tracy is new to movies & really shines. But John Travolta steals the whole movie . He is fully in drag as Enda, Tracy's mom. But he can dance & sing for real. Some well known faces such as Michelle Phieffer, Chris Walken & others lend support. The plot? Dross. The dancing is the thing. Very good original rock n' roll style muscic & singing. Great live & pretty good on the larger stage of movies.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|A friend of mine brought this movie over to my place.  Upon the first scene I was hooked.  It opens up to Glen Hansard's character singing on the street in Dublin...and the song and the man capture my heart.  Than walks in Marketa Irglova and the deal was sealed.  This movie captures the energy of music, art, love and loss.  I went directly to Amazon.com and purchased the movie and soundtrack.  I had to have these songs in my collection!

0060254920|5.0|I first discover Sasek as I bough Little Bear for my daughter. She was watching the series on tv and she asked me to buy the books. Then I decided to buy other Sendak books and I ordered this. I was surprised as I am 37 years old and I never read it, I think because it was not published in Italy and there was not amazon nor internet. I has a \\"scary\\" book by Ungerer, but it wasn't similar at all.<br />The book it's not  a traditional children book and I think my daughter that is 4 year and old liked it, but she did not understand the meaning very well as it is not so easy for a child.<br />The subject is emotional and there is not a big story and I think that the most important fact about Where the Wild Things Are is that it shows a brave child who has not fears and goes alone in a place full of (not so) scary monsters. That's why I think that the story is not so strong, but the meaning and the symbols are much more important. The illustrations are amazing, as always with Sasek.
B0012QE4OO|2.0|With all the phenomenal superpowers and grandiose action potential, Jumper ultimately falls short in execution. Creative ideas are at work, yet so little is done to properly expand upon their possibilities. What is essentially marketed as a sci-fi action film displays only a few scenes of solid mayhem (the majority of which is revealed in the trailers) and any sci-fi elements are left almost entirely unexplained. Jumper does manage to entertain with the anticipation of something grand, and rooting for an antihero who possesses almost no likeable traits poses an interestingly twisted charm, but the frustration with similarities between what could have been and what ended up threatens to negate any positives.<br /><br />After falling into a frozen lake and magically teleporting to safety, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes the potential of his mysterious gift. Running away from home, he begins to live life to the fullest - at the expense of others. Robbing banks and teleporting to exotic locales around the world, David amasses a small fortune and a glamorous lifestyle that he uses to woo his childhood sweetheart, Millie (Rachel Bilson). Traveling to Rome to seduce her, David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another \\"jumper,\\" and learns of a secret organization whose mission is to hunt down and destroy those possessing such teleportation abilities. Desperate to avoid capture and protect Millie, David must join forces with Griffin to stop the murderous organization leader, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson).<br /><br />Chances are many a critic will have ill to say about the acting, and while much of the negativity may take aim at Hayden Christensen, it has less to do with his acting abilities and more to do with the scope of the character he was given to portray. With all of his teleporting superpowers, David feels too normal; his traits steer towards the selfish reality of having such gifts. He uses his power to chase girls, rob banks, and picnic atop famous structural wonders. Few redeeming qualities or admirable motives surface in this antihero-of-sorts and renders the warning \\"there are always consequences\\" somewhat of a joke. The consequences of such materialistic wrongdoing is that an angry, white-haired black man will hunt you down - but you'll still save the day and get the girl without anyone really having to pay. For some unknown reason we're supposed to root for this character (perhaps a lesser of two evils?) and even more inexplicably we do. So is Christensen to blame? Yes, but that's not a bad thing. Rachel Bilson's Millie offers a pretty face and ugly dialogue, and Griffin exhibits even fewer likeable qualities than David, but is much less interesting. Sam Jackson plays himself again, complete with requisite scars and terrible costume.<br /><br />Teleporting has always been a fascinating creation of science fiction, and Jumper's premise requires no reason and only a destination. Choosing to explain nothing isn't nearly as unsatisfying as choosing not to jump outside the box and realize truly creative possibilities. David only uses his powers to travel to exotic locations, woo girls, and unburden banks of their money - not that there's anything wrong with that, but I had hoped for some slightly more jaw-dropping uses of such a limitless ability.<br /><br />Doug Liman's latest actioner steadies itself upon a promising premise and then never decides to jump off. Predictable characters, an overused (albeit cool) special effect, and countless unresolved conflicts keep Jumper from achieving greatness. The film ironically parallels David's early proposition to Millie to \\"skip the boring parts\\" of their journey - but apparently it also skipped over anything that would have given the film enough substance to stay afloat.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinseeming qualities or admirable motives surface in this antihero-of-sorts and renders the warning \\"there are always consequences\\" somewhat of a joke. The consequences of such materialistic wrongdoing is that an angry, white-haired black man will hunt you down - but you'll still save the day and get the girl without anyone really having to pay. For some unknown reason we're supposed to root for this character (perhaps a lesser of two evils?) and even more inexplicably we do. So is Christensen to blame? Yes, but that's not a bad thing. Rachel Bilson's Millie offers a pretty face and ugly dialogue, and Griffin exhibits even fewer likeable qualities than David, but is much less interesting. Sam Jackson plays himself again, complete with requisite scars and terrible costume.     Teleporting has always been a fascinating creation of science fiction, and Jumper's premise requires no reason and only a destination. Choosing to explain nothing isn't nearly as unsatisfying as choosing not to jump outside the box and realize truly creative possibilities. David only uses his powers to travel to exotic locations, woo girls, and unburden banks of their money - not that there's anything wrong with that, but I had hoped for some slightly more jaw-dropping uses of such a limitless ability.    Doug Liman's latest actioner steadies itself upon a promising premise and then never decides to jump off. Predictable characters, an overused (albeit cool) special effect, and countless unresolved conflicts keep Jumper from achieving greatness. The film ironically parallels David's early proposition to Millie to \\"skip the boring parts\\" of their journey - but apparently it also skipped over anything that would have given the film enough substance to stay afloat.     - The Massie Twins

B000WMFZMY|4.0|From the opening overture, it's evident that El Cid is going to be epic. And it positively doesn't disappoint. With distinguished knights-in-shining-armor, swordfights, illustrious battles, damsels in distress, evil kings, calculating queens, and soaring music, El Cid encompasses everything you'd come to expect from a rousing historical adventure epic.<br /><br />In 1080 A.D. Rodrigo Diaz (Charlton Heston) lives by an honor that outweighs convenient principles, and on his way to Spain he decides to set free a group of five enemy Moors. The invading Moors are forever indebted to his mercy and justice (and he is dubbed \\"El Cid\\"), but the King's champion, Count Gormaz, declares Rodrigo a traitor. When Rodrigo's father stands up for him in court, his name is shamed, and to regain his honor Rodrigo is forced to kill the Count. Gormaz, however, is the father of Rodrigo's true love Chimene (Sophia Loren), who now makes it her duty to see the Cid die. Distraught at the loss of his love, he asks King Ferdinand to allow him to fight the neighboring king for the fate of the city of Calahorra. After besting the knight Don Martin, El Cid is granted the hand of Chimene in marriage, but her hatred causes her to leave him for a convent.<br /><br />When Ferdinand dies, he leaves his kingdom to his three children, who all greedily scheme to rule the whole of Spain. Sancho (Gary Raymond) attempts to imprison Alfonso (John Fraser), who is later freed by El Cid, and Princess Urraca (Genevieve Page) eventually becomes a puppet-master, distempering the court and orchestrating the assassination of Sancho so that Alfonso can claim the throne for himself. El Cid finds himself banned from the realm when he attempts to uproot the assassination plot, and only after he has lost everything, Chimene realizes that her life is not complete without him, and she asks to accompany him in his journey away from Spain.<br /><br />The African warlord Ben Yussuf (Herbert Lom) takes advantage of the feuding leaders of Spain, and begins his conquest of the land, first by attacking Valencia. Recruited once again by a huge army of faithful followers, El Cid must use all of his legendary bravery, courage, war tactics and strategy to defeat the mighty Yussuf, all without the aid of King Alfonso, who condemns Cid for his use of unified Moorish kings who all find a common enemy in Yussuf.<br /><br />Rodrigo is driven by a sense of honor that is perhaps indefinable when it crosses paths with happiness. Like Sir Thomas More in \\"A Man For All Seasons\\" Cid is compelled to act according to righteousness and duty, even when those he assists plainly condemn his reasoning. His honor causes him to cross the wrong people, often repeatedly, but luck, God, or a combination of both see that he serves as a deity to his own advocates. More unbelievable and yet cinematically beautiful is his relationship with Chimene, who from a sense of duty herself decides she must pursue his death, even though she is torn with undying love for him. But most fascinating of all is her eventual change of heart and their reuniting only after El Cid is banished from Spain with a simple act of prideful virtue. All that he originally worked for to free his name of calumny has vanished, but with Chimene by his side, he is left with the only thing that matters.<br /><br />There are no longueurs present in El Cid - it starts right into the action from the opening scene, and despite its three-hour running time, keeps up interest and suspense with sweeping romance, nail-biting jousting, whirling flails, zinging arrows, treacherous assassins, clanging swords, sieges, and large scale infantry skirmishes. While it is not a flawless film, El Cid captures the grandiose feel of other historical giants like Ben-Hur and Spartacus, and is a film that has long awaited an elaborate home video release, presented for the first time on DVD January 29th, 2008 in the first of hopefully many Miriam Collection volumes.<br /><br />- Mike Massie
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love this movie...especially the acting of Rupert Penry-Jones.  He is very much suitable for the role plus the non-verbal pain / resentment / anger / love that he successfully portray on just the way he glances or stares at Anne.  Too bad that the director / cinematographer failed to give his character more weight by providing more camera time.  Instead, they focused on Anne's character that was blandly acted.    I agree with the rest of the critics regarding the ending of the film where Anne was running all over Bath looking for Capt Wentworth.  It could have given more thought so that their interpretation of the novel would still contain Jane Austen's meaning by being more artistic and retaining its essence without being ridiculous which what has been done on this film.    In general, I enjoyed it immensely (Rupert Penry-Jones and the character of Anne's father, Eliott).
0743486285|5.0|I was first sold on this book because it gives a first-hand account concerning the mind of an addict.  Being a psychology major, I knew I was going to eat it up like candy.  I live in a very conservative town and it took 4 months for me to find a copy of Nikki/Sikki's book.  In the mean time, I bought the soundtrack and was immediately hooked.  The lyrics, harmony, everything...is so haunting and addicting.  Unlike most books, I could not read The Heroin Diaries in one sitting.  It took me almost a week to get through it.  When you read what the man went through as he slowly slid into a full blown psychosis, you have to put it down to look around at your life.  He wanted answers about his childhood, he wanted to make the pain stop, he wanted to be important. Like he said, be careful what you wish for.
B000F39M9W|5.0|I own three recordings of Stravinsky's Le Sacre: Eliahu Inbal with the Philharmonia, Robert Craft with the London Symphony, and Yoel Levi with the Atlanta Symphony. I've heard the live Salonen with the LA Philharmonic numerous times on television, and this ranks as one of the greater Rites. Salonen never tones down the barbarism of the piece. The lighter, slower movements are never rushed. \\"The Dance of the Earth\\" is spine-tingling. \\"Glorification of the Chosen Victim\\" is fast and suspenseful. \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" is one of the most perfectly played movements I ever heard. And, best of all, the audience is very quiet during the performance.<br /><br />Night on Bald Mountain and Miraculous Mandarin Suite are also a big plus for this CD.<br /><br />Now, I think you should understand that we'll never hear a perfect version of Le Sacre. With the recordings I own, I can see the flaws. Inbal is glossy and slow, but the fantastic playing of the Philharmonia makes up for it. Craft's authoritative conducting can't adjust to the London Symphony's diminutive understanding of the piece's intensity. Levi's insightful reading, and the Telarc sound, are a pleasure if you won't mind the Atlanta Symphony's chamber-like sound. And even Salonen isn't perfect: woodwinds are a bit too polished, and there are a few occasions in which the conductor misses an important mark (such as the weak timpani and tuba explosion in \\"Augurs of Spring\\"). I don't know about Stravinsky's own Columbia recording, but almost everyone does say that it's quite possibly the most intense Rite recording ever.<br /><br />But still, each Rite has a difference. Whether you want excessive bombast, or red-hot intensity, or Karajan-like lyricism, or even a straightforward approach, it always depends on personal opinion. So get the Salonen Rite for its intensity.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Stupid.  Puerile.  Stilted.  Broad.  And all the better for it.  I rented this when it first came out.  I didn't laugh much.  It really did nothing for me.   But my girlfriend and I kept throwing lines from the film at one another for weeks afterwards and cracking each other up. (I should have known then).  A few years later I caught it again on cable and ended up on the floor.  This movie was the impetus for a new rule in my life.  I now give almost all comedies (at least ones with a cast like this one) a second chance.  Sometimes your mood changes things so dramatically.  This movie is so chocked full of priceless lines it's ridiculous.  Others have gone on about them in detail, so I won't bother.  But just thinking about this movie makes me laugh.  Check your inner adult at the door and go along for the over-the-top trip back to a 1970's that never was.  Indulge in every possible myth and stereotype, and don't forget to bring your jacuzzi trunks and a flute.

0618918248|3.0|The author presents his rather scattered opinions in a very awkward and rambling fashion. Although very well read and in command of a multitude of sources to quote, the author fails to present even a semblance of rationality in his arguments and uses the same invalid reasoning that he accuses his opponents of using. Worth the read just to gain the information and sources but not at all convincing even to someone who basically agrees with the premises.
B000002KE2|4.0|Certainly, in these \\"modern times\\" making a comment of a Heavy Metal music album may sound like 'out of time', 'music my dad heard when he was a foolish teen buddy', and so on.<br /><br />However, this Vol. 4 from Black Sabbath is a surprise box. Lots of guitar riffs, the screaming and sometimes terrifying voice of Ozzy Osbourne, songs that mix pure Heavy Rock music with Latin and even classical chords... Wow!<br /><br />This album is a must-have for any serious Rock listener and collector.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|I thought the collection of songs was outstanding and that Halford's voice has been kept in tact.  Pretty remarkable after such a long hiatus, but the songs are well written and the mix of sound is superb.  Couldn't wait for the tour, learned all the lyrics and still rock to them today!  A CD I was able to turn a non-Priest fan onto, bought more than one copy.  Finally, Rob's voice is superior to Geoff Tate's.
B000069HJI|3.0|The title of this album could have been, at no doubt, \\"Famous Last 70s Music Work\\"... There were a lot of things that changed in the Music world at the end of that decade.<br /><br />This Supertramp album, certainly is a sample of what happened... After the smashing success they had with \\"Crime Of The Century\\" and even more with \\"Breakfast in America\\", it was quite hard for the creative couple Hodgson/Davies to reach the same peak of success with this \\"Famous...\\".<br /><br />In spite of it, the album has some nice tunes. The 50s-styled ballad \\"My Kind Of Lady\\" (one of the best Supertramp songs in my opinion), the long-airplay \\"It's Raining Again\\", but also to be mentioned \\"Know Who You Are \\", \\"C'est Le Bon\\" and even the ignored Hit \\"Put On Your Old Brown Shoes\\".
B00102FELM|5.0|I've been collecting the body of work from SCORPIONS for the past 25 years and this particular DVD is my most valued item in my collection.  I don't care where it was imported from, (mine came from Germany), I'd rate it 7 stars, if I could.  You need to be a REAL 'fan' to appreciate how the current members of the band managed to collaborate on stage for this DVD, former & founding members of the band.  They put aside any and all differences and pride; Matthias shows grace and finesse when on stage, playing along with Uli Jon Roth.  The songs were selected by members of the fan club who were given a choice of 50 to choose from.  The songs that made this concert are truly a \\"Journey through time.\\"  Some songs played have not been played in recent years (live) or at all, so it's a treat for them to pull out all the stops and return to their roots.  I feel, as usual, Klaus' voice is not mixed very well within the sound and that he's a little drowned out by such LOUD (but awesome riffs).  The photography angles are good but you can tell the footage was edited quite a bit by quick changes in the focus.  These are production issues, not quality of the content problems.  They're performances are MASTERFUL, full of renewed energy, and they all appear very happy on this \\"Night to Remember.\\"  I had a sense of having gone to a live performance when it was over, it gave me the chills.  Even band historians, such as myself, saw new things and the thrills kept coming.  Buy one for yourself AND a friend, there's no doubt you're not the only one who will want this level of pure enjoyment.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie.  I really believed it to be a \\"chick-flick\\".  I was wrong.  This is an awe-inspiring movie that, I believe, most people just glossed over...a huge mistake.  The critics didn't give this much of a chance...too bad for them.  I found this movie to be incredible from the story line to the music to the development of the plot line.  The climax was a tear jerker even though you knew all along he was going to be reunited with his parents but the process by which this happens just keeps you filled with hope.  And that is the message of the movie, hope kept alive by a dream.  As the song lyrics say,\\"Hold on tight to your dreams\\".  Watch the movie and be throughly entertained.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|What a wonderful story. Gus and Woodroe are the two main characters, played by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. What an excellent duo. They made me laugh and cry. Great western. Another classic you will want to watch again.

0800141660|5.0|While I love everything Jane Austen, I especially love this movie.  Emma Thompson is superb.
080701429X|5.0|This book is a classic as both an compelling human story and a model of self-help, self-actualization.  It is a tough story of surviving an unbelievable trial but if you want to learn about building self accountability and strength, this classic book on your library shelf.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews and I am appalled. Someone is fixated on the fact she used to be a model. Another one compares her to Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan... Obviously, these people do not speak French. Because if they did they would realize that Bruni's lyrics (mostly written by her) are fantastic. And this is what really matters here, not her looks. These poetic songs are also very well interpreted: Bruni's soft voice matches the lyrics, she makes them come to life. It is songwriting at its best. If you speak or understand French, you won't be disappointed.
B000VECAEO|4.0|Seasons 8 and 9 pale a little in comparison to the first 7 seasons (when Larry David was still on board), but they are all still funnier than 99% of everything else that has ever been on TV.

B00138H6R8|3.0|Stereotomy is The Alan Parsons Project's (APP) 9th album.  It was released near the end of 1985, not all that long after a calmer, more characteristic concept album - Vulture Culture.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are an APP listener, you know that their music swings from etherial instrumentals and mellow ballads to driving techno-rock.  This album presents more of the latter.<br /><br />The tracks \\"Stereotomy\\", \\"Stereotomy Two\\", \\"Beaujolais\\", and \\"In the Real World\\" all have a clipped, strong techno-rock sound, though sometimes cacophonous, and therefore, not among my personal favorites.<br /><br />\\"Urbania\\", on the other hand, is an outstanding progressive rock instrumental, and well worth a listen.  The other instrumentals, \\"Where's the Walrus\\" and \\"Chinese Whisper\\" seem uninspired.  In fact, in my opinion, \\"Chinese Whisper\\" (at only 1 min long) is little more than a preamble to \\"Stereotomy Two.\\"<br /><br />I don't quite know what to make of \\"Light of the World\\".  The song is a passable, though certainly not a memorable mellow offering.<br /><br />On the other hand, I find \\"Limelight\\" to be HIGHLIGHT OF THE ENTIRE ALBUM!  It is one of the few songs on this disc that reminds me of what I like best about APP.<br /><br />I know that different people have different opinions and tastes when it comes to anything, but I don't see how this album rates more than about 3 stars.  The two best tracks in my opinion - \\"Limelight\\" and \\"Urbania\\" don't salvage the rest of the album.<br /><br />If you have not listened to APP before, I recommend giving this album a miss, for the time being, and start out with \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", \\"I Robot\\", \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" or even \\"Vulture Culture\\" for a taste of APP's best.<br /><br />This album, except for a couple of songs, seldom finds its way to my playlists.<br /><br />From a 30+ year APP listener.
B000022TSY|5.0|Love the motorcycles and stoner characters. Seems like a fun time period to live in.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Buble is a breath of fresh air.  His renditions of old favorites and his newer material make him the heir apparent to Tony Bennett and Sinatra. He is beginning to develope his own style in the last few years and for his own sake, artistically, I hope he does. There is certainly nothing wrong with doing the old stuff as it is great to hear once again.  I'm an old rocker from the 60's, and my hearing is shot as a result so as I mellow in my old age and get used to my hearing aid MB's music is going to help lead me into the autumn of my life.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I've owned at least 5 pairs of these headphones in the past few years, and they are good, but definitely not great headphones.  Pros:   Sound is good (if you can get the buds to stay in your ears)  Price is low    Cons: The earbuds always fall out, so I have started wearing them with a hat over them to keep the buds in place and keep them from constantly falling out of my ears.  Also, for extensive working out, the sweat seems to drip down the earpiece and pool in your ears, leaving you constantly taking them out to dry off the earbud and the inside of your ear.  And, they can be very hit-and-miss.  I've had 3 or 4 pairs where 1 ear completely stops working after a couple weeks, and then I have to find my receipt and take them back to the store to exchange them.  But the pair I have now has lasted me for at least 6 months and both ears still work.      But hey, for $8, they have decent sound quality, and you don't have to worry about losing them at the gym.
B000K15VSA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000K15VSA Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />I would say that this is \\"The Definitive Limited Edition DVD Collectible Box Set\\" to the 1982 Ridley Scott film; Blade Runner.  I must say it is a contender to some of the more 'pricey' box sets out there, if You have the opportunity to buy this one, BUY IT NOW before it's too late, otherwise You could end up spending up to $300.00 or more from online shops or private sellers in the near future!<br /><br />What You see is what You get from the photos here on Amazon, and it's even better in person.<br />The coolest item for Me was the SPINNER car, made of plastic with working doors, however, not recommended for kids. The next cool item is the motion card of Harrison Ford/Deckard, set in a thick protective plastic baseball/football card type holder. Then there is the Unicorn, made of  chrome painted plastic, which very fragile! Also there is the Art Portfolio with pre-production art on one side with production stills on the back.<br /><br />The only down side to this release is that Warner Home Video could have made room(\\"Marketing Strategy\\")  in this collector's case for the 3 CD Vangelis soundtrack, but hey, beggars can't be choosy here.<br /><br />The upside is that Warner Brothers actually released this DVD in 4 versions; 2-disc, 4-disc, 5-disc(Reviewed here) and the 5-disc in Europe (without the case of goodies) which converting the Swedish kronor to U.S dollar is about $78.00, I guess I saved some money on this one, and at least we did not get rooked in to buying multiple releases, which usually happens on the more popular titles, 6 months after 'Special Collectors Editions\\" hit the streets.<br /><br />All said, this is 'THE' collectors' set for \\"The DVD Box Set Collector\\"!
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|I bought this series for my girlfriend, so of course I get to watch it with her.  I really enjoy the show, but more than 1/2 an hour of this teenage girl drama makes me want to die; I just can't stop watching it.  The show is dark and depressing but redemptive, yielding a paradoxical viewing experience.  So if you're into dark and depressing, or love teenage girl drama this is the show for you.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore has created a clever, somewhat humorous, but very serious film about the American Healthcare System. The film is well done; don't let the title put you off.

0307387178|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. I've been an avid reader for over 20 years now (since about the age of 16) and this book moved me more deeply than all but a handful of others. You really come to know and admire the central character and feel the deep sense of loss as his life comes to its tragic end. Krakauer does such an amazing, respectful account of his life that does not ignore or minimize McCandless' faults while also illuminating his psyche and gentle spirit. The only minor criticism that I have involves the chapters about his own brush with death in Alaska while climbing \\"the Devil's Thumb\\". I thought he spent a little too much time with this diversion though I understand why he did it. He was pointing out parallels between himself and Chris to make the case that there was much more to Chris than being an impulsive lover of nature. I can't recommend this book highly enough. The movie and the soundtrack are also both incredible.
0767827902|5.0|Moving, mature, powerful and thought provoking is The Last Picture Show as it leads us through the lives and scandles of ordinary, fault-ridden people in a small, poor, dusty, Texas town in the 1950s getting in touch with their career and sexual identies.  Excellent cast, excellent direction, excellent black and white photography.  Very memorable.<br /><br />I remember I first saw \\"The Last Picture Show\\" when I was young--probably attracted by news that it showed some full-frontal nudity, which it does, but \\"The Last Picture Show\\" is no porno flick by a long shot, and any nudity which exists is for the conveyance of the story, not to sexually arouse the audience.<br /><br />When I was young, but still old enough to get into the movie, I wasn't mature enough to fully understand it.  It's almost like you have to be over 35 years old to appreciate it as the work of art it is.  I'm in my 50s now and very glad to have this masterpiece in my collection.
0321544080|5.0|Thank you Joe McNally for sharing your knowledge - reading this book really feels like I am sitting in the room having coffee with you, talking through how you set-up each photo.

This book is fantastic!    P.S.  Thanks to Scott Kelby for selling Joe the book idea!
0307388840|5.0|Ian McEwan's Atonement is a dense novel; it has an intricate structure, and broad themes that elicit universal resonance.  Set in England in the 1935's and ending in 1999 the novel follows the life of Briony Tallis, an English girl, from childhood to old age, touching on issues of family, class, war, good and evil, atonement, and forgiveness.  Through the consciousness of Briony, McEwan asks questions about who controls human destiny.  Do we write our own scripts?      Like real life, the novel is complicated by multiple viewpoints: Cecilia's, Robbie's, and most importantly Briony's.  Each character has a limited perspective.  Only the reader has access to the larger picture.  McEwan shows life as perspectival, and shows the closest thing to truth is the union of multiple, sometimes conflicting narratives.  At the age of thirteen Briony Tallis tells a lie that negatively affects the lives of her sister Cecilia, and Cecilia's lover Robbie Turner.  Her lie accuses Robbie of raping her young cousin Lola.  Robbie loses a promising career, is sent to prison, and finally suffers the indignities of war as a foot soldier.  Cecilia stands by Robbie, and forsakes her family because they believe Briony's lie.      When Briony understands the implications of her evil act she dedicates her life to making reparation.  The dictionary says atonement is the making of reparation for a sin or a mistake.  Briony, an upper-class girl, skips university to go into nursing in the middle of WWII as atonement for her terrible lie.  She obeys hostile superiors, empties bedpans, dresses unimaginable wounds, and brings comfort to young soldiers torn apart physically and emotionally by war.  She exchanges self-absorption for selfless care of others.      Briony admits her lie in front of Cecilia and Robbie.  Her life of atonement and her admission of truth do not influence the couple to forgive her.  Though they refuse pardon, they demand a witnessed written statement by Briony with the real facts, and an admission to the family about the lie.  She promises to do this, and accepts their refusal of absolution.  Briony can never repair the damage she has done.  Her selfless work gives solace to others, but not her sister and Robbie.      Beyond the plot the novel is complicated by its structure.  One narration is Briony's life; the other story is Briony's writing.  She creates narratives in her imagination, which are played out in real life.  She actually writes the story of Cecilia and Robbie, and exposes the true rapist.  At first the reader is aware that this is reality.  Then the reader begins to question outcomes.  Is Briony writing this or living it?  Where is the boundary between life and art?   Briony, facing the onset of dementia, writes the final chapters of the story with enough ambiguity the reader is left wondering what actually happened.  As a writer we know Briony has the capacity to play god--to control outcomes.  But the reader is unclear about who is in control of destiny.  McEwan asks profound questions, but gives no obvious answers.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|The title pretty much sums it up. If you liked Crank or any of the transporter films you'll enjoy this.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|As others have summarized the episodes and the premise I'll skim over that aspect, save to say this fills a TV void left by the departure of such creative shows like the X-Files and Buffy. Yes, they seem to have the need to add gratuitous sexual content to every, single episode, but this can be forgiven as you'll like the characters and the writing.     (...)
B000H5U832|5.0|This was a first time trip to the movies for my little one. He sit still for the whole 2 hour movie at the age of 3yrs.  He has watched this movie more times than I can count and the rest of the family enjoys it too.
0792843584|3.0|I enjoyed this western when it first appeared on the moviescreen in 1980 and will buy it in hi-def when it's available. Cimino attempted an epic western on a grand scale, but I think he attempted to do too much and ended up with a flawed but still worthwhile movie.  There's a plot leap at the beginning and an astounding one at the end; I guess he ran out of time and budget money and ideas. He even went overboard on custumes and staging, which decreases the realism of the movie.     For example, the dressed-up Kristofferson and others in neat, clean, starched shirts and ties going about his business as if that's way some guys did it in those days, especially if they arrived in the West with a college degree. The scene at the meeting hall where the folks in their immigrant attire are neatly seated and flawlessly lined up - can't you see the director spouting orders to arrange this ?     The forgettable, odd, 20-year leap at the end to a neat 50-foot yacht where the financially successful (somehow) Kristofferson in happily sailing into the unknown with his woman. I guess you can't keep a good man down. Give me a break!     That said, it is still a unique western and provides background on the Johnson County wars that pitted immigrant squatters against wealthy landowners. The cast and photography are very good. The movie however, could have been shortened by 30 minutes.
0374280967|4.0|While on a walk with the dogs, the Queen stumbles upon a Bookmobile parked outside the Windsor kitchens, the only occupants being the driver and a kitchen servant.  So as not to seem rude, Her Royal Majesty borrows a book intending to send it back the following week.  And while she reads the book and finds it dry, she borrows another, and begins an obsession with reading.  Previously enjoyable activities become a chore as they keep her away from her current reading.  It makes her late for opening Parliament, and she perfects the practice of waving from the carriage while keeping her attention on the book hidden out of sight in her lap.  She deviates from the usual conversation with the locals; instead of talking about the traffic, she asks what they're reading - with uncomfortable consequences.  Even the Prime Minister and foreign heads of state are not immune from her questions and suggestions on books to read.  Her staff gets quite rattled with these changes, even stooping to undermine her habit, and her formerly impeccable attire suffers slightly.<br /><br />This is an easy to read novella which I finished in just a couple of hours.  Once I started I couldn't put it down, and found myself laughing at the situations Her Majesty finds herself in.  I'm not familiar with the author or other contemporary English literature, so I'm afraid that some of it passed over my head, but I couldn't help but sense plenty of subtle wittiness in it's pages.  But anyone who's found themselves obsessed with reading will feel a sense of familiarity in the story and relate to the lengths she goes to in indulging her habit, and some may even relate to her conclusions at the end.  I found the writing to be very intelligent, and was forced to consult a dictionary several times with unfamiliar English words, and the style to be subtly humorous on multiple levels.  A good read I can recommend to anyone who's ever found themselves unable to put a book down.<br /><br />(EDIT: If you like this book may I recommend [[ASIN:0385342306 The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie]] by Alan Bradley).ommend [[ASIN:0385342306 The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie]] by Alan Bradley).
B000Y179KO|5.0|This is pure Eagles - takes me back to the 70's and 80's loungin' and drinkin' in the sun of the Florida Keys, and listening to Eagles song after Eagles song, because they never made a bad one. The same still holds true, and anyone who doesn't believe that needs to listen to the songs on LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN just twice to be hooked. Well worth the wait!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|How I Met Your Mother comes from a traditional branch of TV productions but somehow manages to bring something new and fresh. A good sitcom is good writing and good actors, and this one has it all.  The only disappointment is the packaging of the set: 3 DVD's in two slim packs, with a design that has a little touch of amateurism.   But at this price, I'm not complaining...
B0000CAXIC|5.0|I had the pleasure of getting to shake Dave Grohl's hand behind the stage at Summerfest (Milwaukee, WI) on the Colour and the Shape tour on July 5, 1997.  I was keenly aware that TCATS was an amazing album at the time, but the perspective of another 10 years passed has revealed just how incredible the record is from start to finish.  Never again have the Foos really recaptured the feeling, the lyric qualities, and the ability to rock with emotion found on this album (though Echoes is a close second).<br /><br />With unforgettable songs like \\"Monkeywrench\\" and \\"Everlong\\" and a slew of amazing songs that never saw the light of day on the radio but were indeed radio-worthy especially compared with the junk out there today, The Colour and the Shape is a solid album.  Anyone who's followed the band from the beginning will quickly point to the Colour and the Shape as their best album, without reservation.  It's a cd you should have on your shelf.<br /><br />The re-release in 2007 included the B-sides that were included with the singles accompanying the original release, and re-mastered versions of the LP.  This was not necessary, and although the B-sides saw a fair amount of radio play, they're distracting from the classic original.  If you don't have the album, you are better served getting the extra songs in the re-release, but I feel sorry for you having missed the boat with the original release and the coveted place it has on my shelf.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|I liked a number of songs on this CD. I'm happy to know that the song which first caused me to get this CD is the first track!  I absolutely adore it.  I expect more surprises coming from this fine and becoming artist in the future.  Sara Bareilles's LITTLE VOICE CD is actually heard in a magnetically loud voice. Her songs are strong and uplifting as well as real as can be without the punching bag lyrics. I give her high accolades for this effort. Most songwriting (music) today have a lot of punching bag aura. * * * * *
B000020617|4.0|I always felt that a song's ability to withstand the test of time was the true measure of its value, and not much can be said in that regard for There Is Nothing Left to Lose.  Now, don't get me wrong - it's a fine album.  But it's not the Foo Fighters' best album.  There are plenty of catchy songs on it, but compared to other efforts in the band's collection, there is nothing remarkable about this album, as much as it pains me to say it.<br /><br />\\"Learn to Fly\\" got a lot of radio play (and a hilarious video to go along with it, as the Foo often do), and some other solid songs are sprinkled into the album - my favorites being \\"Headwires\\" and \\"Generator.\\"  Ultimately, though, the delivery is more or less flat.  I think the biggest problem with the album is that there's nothing musically new or challenging for the band; it's almost as though they're beating a dead horse.  This was corrected on every subsequent album.<br /><br />I am an enormous Foo Fighters fan, and I adore all their CDs.  This one just happens to be the weakest in the collection.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This soundtrack from the movie, Once, presents the splendid music by the musicians who created the movie so that it can be heard apart from the context.  These songs stand on their own merits.
B000UFAURI|5.0|Musically, this is the most creative and most carefully constructed album the band has ever put out.  Although it's impossible to recapture the glory that was The Colour and the Shape, Dave Grohl and company have proven they are capable of considerable musical growth.  Although they dabbled with acoustic, lighter music on In Your Honor, they have gained traction with the lighter, melodic side of things with Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace.  It is clear they are much more comfortable playing a little quieter, and most surprisingly, singing lyrics with deeper meaning than ever before.  That in itself, is a major departure from where Grohl started with the self-titled album in 1995.  And perhaps that's the most encouraging and exciting thing about this album: the band has something meaningful to say.
B000000OSG|5.0|Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion II, the slightly more highly regarded of the two  Use Your Illusion releases, is widely enjoyed by those who like a great mix of rock n' roll styles, and widely disliked by those who prefer more pretentious music or who take their love of Bob Dylan a little too seriously.  And, as with any number of albums that have made a big impact on the face of rock n' roll, those who dislike it seem to complain about it...endlessly.<br /><br />Ah, well.  I never said it was easy being a Guns fan, but I take solace in the quality of the music on this album.<br /><br />The first four tracks, \\"Civil War,\\" \\"14 Years,\\" \\"Yesterdays,\\" and Dylan cover \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" mark one of the longest, fairly easy going stretch of songs on any GNR album.  Beginning with \\"Civil War,\\" which balances softer verses against a harder chorus, the album opens very differently than Use Your Illusion I, which really got off to an aggressive start.  Rather, UYI II is the more cerebral of the two, which \\"Civil War\\" demonstrates with some great, and well thought out lyrics.  The (relatively) laid back approach continues through \\"14 Years\\" and \\"Yesterdays,\\" each offering an approach that, at the time, was pretty new to GNR, before \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" pays tribute to one of the band's idols.<br /><br />The aggression picks up, however, with the blisteringly critical \\"Get in the Ring,\\" an over the top calling out of many of the band's nemeses, and continues in \\"Shotgun Blues,\\" a song that is really just layered aggressive rock n' roll...the guitar, the vocals, the bass and drums...all driving a frantic track that would have been at home on Appetite for Destruction.<br /><br />The middle of the album is marked by the stellar \\"Breakdown\\" which, despite being completely unknown to those who only get their GNR from MTV or the radio, is one of the best tracks of the band's career.  Great lyrics, killer guitar, and a striking balance between bluesy rock and a harder rock that ends the song in a fury all combine to make this an amazing track.<br /><br />The harder note on which \\"Breakdown\\" ends carries over into the next two tracks, \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" and \\"Locomotive,\\" which really help to fill out the album's middle with some strong instrumental work that defies the label \\"filler.\\"  Tracks like these make a listener realize that there really is a lot of incredibly strong material on this album, and much of it is wholly unknown to the public at large.<br /><br />A very subdued track in \\"So Fine\\" follows, and it pours right into the mood set by the opening notes of the album's epic masterpiece, \\"Estranged,\\" which is really one of the all time great GNR tracks.  The lyrics are really top notch, as are all the instrumental performances, most especially the piano which adds a great touch to the track.<br /><br />\\"You Could Be Mine\\" completes the 1-2 punch, following \\"Estranged,\\" as one of the album's most unrelenting hard rockers.  The chugging bass line, killer guitar, and some of the best vocal work on the album mark this as a standout track.<br /><br />To some extent, the album closes on a bit of a down note.  While \\"Don't Cry\\" is a great track in the band's catalog, this version simply features different lyrics and is otherwise, for the most part, identical to that of UYI I.  While a good song, and one that lends a nice connection between the two albums, I would have preferred another unique track.  This leads into \\"My World,\\" which is more of a strange, industrial tinged outro than a proper song, ending the album on an utterly strange note.<br /><br />All in all, however, this is a phenomenally good album.  It features a variety of styles, some incredibly good songwriting, and great performances from all members of the band.  A winner!fury all combine to make this an amazing track.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|Hold down the SHIFT key the first time you insert they disc into your computer's cd drive, then immediately rip it to your hard drive, and that will prevent the obnoxious auto-protect software from auto-installing on your computer.<br /><br />The album was amazing, a new, charged-up sound for the band that was refreshing to an old fan's ears.  The first disc, the hard-hitting side, is solid from start to finish.  It's too bad that \\"Best of You\\" was acutely overplayed on the radio; songs like \\"No Way Back\\" and \\"DOA\\" were superior songs.<br /><br />The quiet, acoustic side, was a departure (an experiment, if you will) for the band.  Musically, I think Grohl wanted to prove he could do something besides scream into the mic.  Unfortunately, an entire disc of this is a little bit unbearable.  Overall, the quiet side is not memorable, but songs such as \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" and \\"Still\\" are hidden gems on what is essentially the B-side for the album.  Thankfully, they have struck a balance between hard and soft with 2007's \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace.\\"
B000003BZ4|5.0|On this, their self-titled debut, Gov't Mule prove without a doubt that they're far from a simple \\"side-project.\\"  With more emotion, more blues, and more soul in one guitar lick or one vocal line than the sum of most popular music from the last ten years, Gov't Mule demands to be heard by anyone and everyone who demands more from music and musicians.  Cheap, ripped off and repeating riffs don't exist here.  Snotty, \\"I'm too cool to care\\" vocals cannot be found.  What can be found, however, is a band that simply sweats and bleeds emotion into its music.<br /><br />From the first soulful moments of the a capella \\"Grinnin' in Your Face,\\" which bleeds right into the gut-wrenching guitar playing of Warren Haynes on \\"Mother Earth,\\" it's very evident that this is not the same old thing.  This album (and all of Mule's work, really) is filled to the brim with great instrumental work, amazingly soulful and powerful vocals, and incredibly potent songwriting.  I simply cannot say anything bad about this album.
B0000CAXID|4.0|Kurt Cobain's suicide in the spring of 1994 was a shock to the rock music community, and particularly troubling for band members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl.  When Grohl was reported to be working on a new project, I salivated with anticipation.  I loved the album immediately, almost unconditionally, upon its release.<br /><br />The sound is not as raw as Nirvana, instead a sort of power-pop solo project put out by Grohl.  Grohl was still fairly young, and had never been the front man of any band, and here he was, only a year after the death of his close friend, dipping his toes into the water of his own band.  As a result, the sound is relatively timid compared to later albums the Foo Fighters have put out, and with historical perspective we can see the self-titled album for what it is.<br /><br />Most noticeably, the sound quality on the album is not particularly amazing for what it could have been.  The band recently released a re-mastered version of The Colour and the Shape, which really didn't need re-mastering, when they really should have re-mastered the self-titled album.<br /><br />But the foundations for the band were also established with this album; a hilarious sense of humor came forth in the music video for \\"Big Me,\\" spoofing the (consciously) campy Mentos commercials on television at the time.  The musical style of alternating quiet and LOUD that is a hallmark of the Foos, carried over from  Nirvana, is seen throughout the album.<br /><br />Musically, the guitar work is not challenging, the lyrics are nonsensical, and you can't hardly hear the bass guitar on the recording.  But the tunes are great, and there are some real gems on the album.  Singles \\"This is a Call,\\" \\"I'll Stick Around,\\" and \\"Big Me,\\" tracks 1, 2, and 3, on the album, make the album front-heavy.  That is not to say the rest cannot be enjoyable.<br /><br />If you're used to the pace of Foo Fighters albums released since 2003, you might not enjoy the self-titled release as much as Idid when it was released in 1995.  The pace is more moderate; no acoustic ballads, no hard-hitting rock like \\"One By One\\" or \\"The Pretender\\" are to be found here.  But no one who can truly call themselves a Foo Fighters fan should be able to live with themselves without this landmark effort on the shelf.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Enjoyed it immensely. It did not follow the book by Heinlein, But it was a good action movie
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie is just as riveting as was the \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and it does spend some time in my beloved Italy.  Hannibal Lector will have yo spell bound.  Moore makes you not miss Foster in this movie, nope not one bit, and in this movies the good guys are the bad guys, or is it the bad guys are the good, oh never mind.  There are some moments that aren't for the faint of heart, but if you can hold through those moments you'll find this a great movie.  Just a foot note here;  The book was 10 times better than the movie with a better ending in my opinion.  Read the book as well but leave the lights on.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This little movie moved me and my husband in a way that few movies have.  The story of two ordinary people who find each other and discover hidden talents in one another is beautifully acted and portrayed with an emotional honesty that is riveting.  It is a real world love story, with real world problems and the music, even more than the script, tells the story and stays with you long after the movie is over. The inside look at how talented people go about their art in the real world makes most Hollywood movies look phony, contrived.  Thankfully, the CD from the movie is lovely and helps rekindle the feelings of seeing it for the first time, but don't listen to the CD until you have seen the movie.  It will spoil the experience!
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Ford says that filming this movie was the worst he has done and hated every moment of it.  Not because of the script but because of the conditions he had to work under.  While he might have gone through hell to film it, he gives one great, must see, performance.  There is not one moment in the film that shouldn't be there and it will have you sad to see it end.  I felt for all the characters in the movie.  Can you have a movie where you feel for the bad guy?  In truth there isn't a bad guy in Blade Runner.  I am so glad I bought it.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|I bought this after hearing just two songs, and really like 90% of the rest of them.  Her music doesn't stay in one genre, and her voice isn't always gravelly - there are some soft, sweet songs and one harder-rocking one (I'm not crazy about that one).  My husband wasn't familiar with her at all before I bought it, but he reaches for this CD frequently.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|A great film. I wont tell you the plot, but if you're not averse to gender bending, and you like stories about initiative and courage, you will enjoy it. It's based on a true story, and is full of good feelings and tough decisions.     The acting is fantastic, and I love when the good people triumph.
B000P2A256|4.0|Not as good as their first album but still easy listening.  My son enjoys their music tremendously!
B000WCBPOG|3.0|So, I thought that the reason I loved the film so much more than any of my friends was due to the fact that although I love & admire the songs of the Beatles, I wasn't married to their recordings of the songs.<br />The reason I'm kind of disappointed with this soundtrack, oddly enough, is because I became so completely attached to the film versions. Hardly anyone has mentioned in their reviews that these aren't the same versions of the songs you hear in the film. The arrangements differ A LOT.<br />*\\"Hold Me Tight\\" is sung solely by Evan Rachel Woods- the vocal of \\"Jude's\\" Liverpool girlfriend? Not there.<br />*\\"A Little Help From My Friends\\" has been reduced to a duet between Joe Anderson & Jim Sturgess, lacking the rambunctiousness of the other guys in the scene.<br />*At the end of \\"It Won't Be Long\\", the tempo never slows down- remember how all of the students are waiting for the clock to chime 3?<br /> ...you get the idea. I really felt like these were some unique moments that added charm to the songs. Without them, despite still being enjoyable, they sometimes seem a little flat. Of course, people have already mentioned the missing songs- \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" was a favorite of mine!<br />As much as I like the cd, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. I wish I'd have known before I bought it. Not that I wouldn't still buy it.

0525950079|3.0|As I had enjoyed Pillars so much, not only the architectural details of the cathedral building, but the view of medieval life, I thought this would be great.  HOWEVER, it neither reached the heights nor the detailed depth of Pillars.  Yes, it was interesting to read more of medieval life--a time to definitely not be a laborer, a serf or a woman! The almost gratuitous sex I didn't need.  It seems that double-dealing, lies, back-stabbing were everwhere--church and laity as it is now.  The enormity of the plague is seen here, with its implications in medicine and the economy. As we follow a handful of characters through their lives in this town (the chronological jumps are well-done) it ends almost too perfectly--nice for the \\"good guys\\", but too neat.  An interesting read, but not up to Pillars--as I said, \\"Too Little and Too Long.\\"
0553381687|5.0|This book is one of those every true fan of fantasy novels must have on their shelves.  It will feel at home alongside your Tolkiens, Moorcocks, Zelaznys, Leibers, and Howards.  Martin has created a rich deep world populated by interesting, if almost always morally questionable, characters.  This epic spans continents and kingdoms, and is filled with political intrigue and battles and interpersonal stories.  It's one of those that is truly hard to put down.  I highly recommend it.<br />Glenn G. Thater - author of \\"Harbinger of Doom\\".
B000J103WK|5.0|I ordered this HD DVD as a hearted fan of The Eagles.  I have owned only one of their albums for the last decade-Hell Freezes Over.  I have been a causal fan of the Eagles for the last decade or so and this album has pushed me to the next level.      This HD DVD is entertaining and exhibits the fun nature and extraordinary music ability of the Eagles.  I am blown away by the show.      Both the quality of the audio and video is excellent.  (Although, I think I need to buy a powered subwoofer to make this concert rock even more).

B0010ZR160|4.0|`Gone Baby Gone' is as unsettling as it is intriguing.  Behind the headlines of child abduction, the movie is disturbingly real with events that develop naturally.  As complicated as life itself, the film captures a mystery of tangled proportions.       Little four-year-old Amanda MacReady has been kidnapped from her Dorchester, MA home.  We see private detective, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) watching the latest breaking stories of her abduction on television with his girlfriend and co-partner, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).  Soon afterward, Amanda's Aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and Uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver) come to their apartment and ask to hire them.  The young investigative couple is skittish at the prospect of taking on a private case while troops of police officers are on the assignment, and its nature isn't exactly like the ones they've tackled before.     But take it they do and soon they meet some tough, but weary veterans, including Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and Det. Denny Bressant (Ed Harris).  Jack Doyle has some pretty harsh words for the Private I. who's skeptical of another investigator and takes each new case personally.  Included in his past is his own daughter who was kidnapped and found dead just yards away from his own residence.  Det. Remy takes his work only slightly less to heart.      Backing Patrick is Helene MacCready, who eventually trusts him more than the police to find her only daughter.  This gives Patrick the advantage of finding some seedy characters in her own life.  Quickly we find out she's a coke addict and has a network of connections that take them into a whole underworld of shady drug dealers and predators.  Soon we're introduced to turf leader \\"Cheese\\" (Edi Gathegi)  and her boyfriend, Leon (Mark Margolis).  (Her family is logically upset with the situation and Helene's irresponsible behavior.)  Seldom does the drama fail to surprise while managing to keep the plot lines accessible.          Directed and co-written by Ben Affleck (whose co-writing for 'Good Will Hunting' won him an Oscar) the movie gets its footing quickly and keeps our interest with its labyrinth investigation and revealingly dark characters.  Amy Ryan's worthy Oscar nomination is the high-water mark of acting amongst a fine cast, including similarly nominated Casey Affleck (albeit for his more nervous and nuanced performance in 'The Assassination of Jesse James...') who keep us on our toes along with the Brothers Affleck.  Engaging and thought-provoking in its ramifications without trying to exploit, `Gone, Baby, Gone' achieves quite a balancing act.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|A collection of songs that  restates a compelling case for the importance of the album as a whole rather than singles or selected songs. Brilliant for its musical  narrative, flow from one song to the next and simplicity.

B000JJSJR8|5.0|The abbreviated review is here: This movie is about gangsters, is directed by Scorsese and stars DeNiro and Pesci. You need to see it, especially in HD-DVD format.<br /><br />The extended review continues... Casino is not as critically acclaimed or part of the movie goer's conscious like Goodfellas (which is an excellent film) but it should be. It's about gangsters and Las Vegas before the big corporations sanitized Vegas and turned it into an adult version of Disney World.<br /><br />It's \\"based on a true story\\", but only loosely. But does it matter? A great story told only the way Scorsese can tell it is entertainment at its best whether it's tightly based on a true story, loosely based on a true story, or is an original fictional screenplay.<br /><br />My only warning is the movie had, at the time, the record number of f-bombs ever in a movie at over 420. I'm personally not offended by it but I watched it with my older Chinese in-laws, who were a little disturbed by the language. I just told them that's the way gangsters talk and the movie is just keepin' it real. Just know this tidbit when choosing your fellow viewers.
B0000024KQ|5.0|As cold, dark and desolate depicted by the album cover and the emblem appears there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Onyx released their sophomore effort All We Got Iz Us where the members' artistic control is held by the production and overall concept.  \\"Life Or Death (Skit)\\" challenges the reason of life because of the enevitable term death by suicide.  Maybe the strength of this album is found on the new world order tune \\"Last Dayz\\". Deep lyrical content of survival with \\"...they make me rob from my own nationality / that's kind of ignorant / but, yo I gotta pay the rent...\\" and the sample vocals top off the song.  The pressure of survival with trust of a few good men on the title track (Evil Streets) featuring P.I.  Getting into the mind of a criminal describing a variety of people on \\"Purse Snatchaz\\" featuring Greg Valentine where the agressive style of each performance highlight the song.  Onyx's signature sound and style is found on \\"Shout\\" as a near mainstream attempt being let out as well as \\"Live Niguz\\".  \\"Betta Off Dead\\" is a continuation of the introduction skit as the trio tag team over a grim tune showcasing the group's talent and thought process.  Dropping volumes on \\"Most Def\\" is just as loud as the other titles completing the album's feel as another highlight.  \\"Act Up (Skit)\\" is a riot starter with the chants.  Emphasising on the performances and contents on \\"Getto Mentalitee\\" featuring All City & P.I. over three key chords.  The bit extreme social conscious \\"2 Wrongs\\" is an eye opener of a revolution fighting for what you believe in.  \\"Maintain (Skit)\\" is a semi-dedication over electric vibes that should have been made into a full length song.  Concluding with \\"Walk In New York\\" to represent their lifestyle for these Queens, New Yorkers.  Member Fredro Starr produced nine of the fifteen tracks to capture Onyx's style.  All We Got Iz Us seized socially deprived Black America and questioned our existance in society with intense lyrical assault.

B000085RTZ|5.0|Epica is a brilliant album that masterfully creates a story of love and life that manages to flow beautifully from track to track.    Featuring the angelic voice of Simone Simmonds from her own band Epica, Kamelot's Epica is definably worth it's weight in gold.
B000R6PKP2|3.0|As a fan of the original 1982 movie, I was excited to see the different versions of this film coalesce into a single high-def collection. The extras of the so called Ultimate Collector's Edition were just too tempting to pass up.    Looking at the images on this and other sites, and considering the price of this collection at retail brick-and-mortar stores, I figured I was getting a deal. The truth is, however, that the quality of the packaging and included items are sub-par and thus do not justify the price premium over the Complete Collector's Edition. The briefcase, origami unicorn, and replica Spinner car are all made of cheap plastic and lack heft, feeling as though they would break if they sustained even a short fall. That's not to say that the packaging within the case isn't nice, I just expected more.    As far as the movie itself, you can't, and shouldn't, expect miracles just because it's been pressed to shiny Blu-ray. Still, for something filmed in the early '80s, it looks pretty good. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, even if he is the most monotone person on the planet.    The final verdict: unless you're a completist, don't bother with the Ultimate Collector's Edition. The Complete Collector's Edition with just the five (5) discs should round out any collector's library nicely.

It looks like all the ones available are not able to be played in the USA so BE CAREFUL.  I'm currently trying to get a refund on a return of the dvd.  Not fun!
B0012QTT6M|5.0|This show is very thought provoking. Makes you really think what kind of person would turn to this type of thing. Bryan Cranston is a great actor and I hope that he gets an award for this series. Shows he is very versatile.  The series continues to be thrilling and gross at the same time.  Leaves me wanting more after each week's episode.

B000F3A7LE|4.0|I respect artists who want to be \\"out there\\" and I am ok with listeners who find some reward to listening to \\"out there\\" music, although I believe there are insecure folks who want to be hipper than thou and glom onto anything weird. I am not a real fan of Fripp, who likes to be out there, but I do believe it is genuine stuff and his fans have a genuine appreciation for it. On Exposure though he was clearly influenced by music and attitude of the NY scene in the late 70's. Lord knows no one will ever declare that Fripp was new wave, or punk but many of the songs here possess that freshness and aggressiveness that ironically took a considerable amount of air out of the Prog music's balloon. Yes, there are ambient noises and requisite weirdness on the album but when it rocks, it really delivers the goods. And the disparate group of artists he brings in will boggle your mind, and yet, it works. Check it out.
B0012PDVUS|5.0|\\"Final Cut\\" is an extraordinary viewing experience, even sans BluRay.<br /><br />You may be wondering what's so different in this FIFTH flavor of this incredibly smart 1982 sci-fi-noir dystopian classic? Content-wise, not that much. Image-wise, incredibly, it is even far, far more stunning than its predecessors. On larger screens, the viewer will feel as though it is almost an entire new experience. In fact, it would make for a superlative in-store test/demo disc. On THAT basis, it is certainly recommended for reviewing and/or repurchase.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott refused to substitute CGI - but rather held to an extraordinary clean-up of the original material. Bravo.<br /><br />Apparently the five-disc box set from Warner Bros. (which includes all five versions and a cornucopia of extras) is the among the most lush and thorough treatment ever given any film - something that should give Criterion the jitters - and give the film's most obsessive devotees the final thrill of all.<br /><br />SPOLIER: Oh yea, just in case you're part of the 10% that didn't get the word: Deckard's also a replicant (though he doesn't know it until the end of the film) and Gaff is the real Blade Runner - using replicants like Deckard to hunt other replicants down. When Gaff leaves an origami unicorn, he's revealing he knows Deckard's (implanted) memories.<br /><br />Click into \\"Final Cut\\" today.
0740748475|5.0|A while back I happened upon a few of the old Calvin and Hobbes compilations and upon reading them was reminded of just how rich and funny these cartoons were. When C&H finally walked off into the sunset, I eagerly awaited the final farewell strip, and was cruelly disappointed when the local news distributor declined to import any newspapers on that day. (I live on a remote Alaskan island) The Complete Calvin and Hobbes has healed that wound. I'd forgotten how funny, in particular the snowmen cartoons were. The 3 volume set is beautifully done, all printed chronologically and dated. Beautiful color repro, nice paper. Volumes are quite heavy. If this is your cup of tea, it's well worth it.

0312330537|5.0|Having spent two months in India the previous winter, I was excited to receive a copy of _Shantaram_ from my stepfather as a holiday gift.  In writing this autobiographical novel, Roberts proves that fiction based on truth is not only stranger, but also more compelling, than pure fiction.  Every facet of the experience that he describes resonates with my own far less outrageous adventures in India; along the way, he manages to communicate, with great eloquence, many deeper truths about life, love, virtue, vice, business, government, violence, friendship, mentorship, and war.  You will not regret reading this book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The first time I watched this production, I thought it was too modern.  The more I view it, the more perfect I think it is.  Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson have amazing on screen chemistry.  The characters they have created will continue to be the definitive Rochester and Jane Eyre!

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Illinois contains a wealth of catchy melodies and gripping imagery, plus plenty of variety in theme, musical style and presentation. The music is an original blend of soulful folk-pop with orchestral infusions. There are some scattered bursts of electrical guitar here and there but the banjo is prominent throughout. Interspersed with colorfully titled brief instrumental snippets, the songs embrace a range of emotions from joy to melancholy. For all its dazzling variety, the album is surprisingly cohesive.<br /><br />The following are my personal favorites:<br />The celebratory Come On Feel The Illinoise with its intricate arrangement, the buoyant Decatur with its witty rhyme scheme and lilting beat, the poignant and solemn Casimir Pulaski Day, the sensitive treatment of a horrible subject like John Wayne Gacy, the mix of sadness and elation in the rousing tune Chicago, Man Of Metropolis with its segments of hard rock guitar and the tender Tallest Man.<br /><br />On these exquisite melodies, Sufjan's intimate voice is often framed by elegant backing vocals over a complex and stirring instrumental mix. Infused with an appealing sense of spirituality, Illinois offers an inspiring and uplifting listening experience.
1594489505|5.0|What a wonderful experience to read this book.  Almost better than  A Kite Runner but they are both so great you should not judge.  I had trouble even putting it down until I could finish.      What a talent this author has.  Look forward to the next one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one of the rare glimpses we occasionally get into what television could be.  At the time this series was being aired we took little time out of our evenings to watch what was available and somehow when we did we were usually sorry.  We did not find this series until it was too late.  We bought Serenity and liked it so much we looked into its roots and bought the series.<br /><br />The characters of Firefly are well developed and believable.  I would still like to know more about each of them, particularly Shepard Book.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Bought this for my husband's bday. He loved all the series he had seen when on-air; I had never seen any, but loved it from the start when we started viewing this collection. One of the best casts for a series I've seen in a while. The box is a great way to store all the dvds w/easy & convenient filing, that commendably takes very little shelf space. Script, acting, storyline, & the package presentation are all quite well done...& I hate spending money on things that aren't truly a necessity or of very high personal value.
B00000729S|4.0|Yes,it's like nothing you've heard before,but it isn't garage and it certainly isn't punk;any Sex Pistols fan who checks out this CD hoping to find the original punk recording is going to be dumbfounded (as well as disappointed.)The Monks play aggressive,fun,rock and roll,but these musicians are no \\"three-chord-wonders,\\"and their music is much more cerebral than garage rock.Although they did have a caustic sense of humor and definite (punk) anti-social tendencies,and they were ahead of their time,the Monks might just as easily be classified as \\"Progressive-Banjo-Jazz-Rock\\".
0143038419|1.0|As the Title of the review suggests.  Although there were certain injections of humor in some paragraphs and certain prudent characters; the rest of the book proved to be unenlightening and rather dull.  What the author seems to constantly refer to seems only common sense to most.  I really don't understand why the book is in the top seller list, unless because of a certain self indulged hypocrite.  There are far more interesting books on the market.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I've always liked this movie and found previous DVD's to be lacking, but this Blu-Ray has everything you could wish for, great picture, great sound and lots of extras. Highly recommended.
B0009TRRN0|5.0|This is grindhouse cinema, it's supposed to be grainy. This movie simply kicks (or slices) butt. Great fight scenes, and plenty of that thick corn syrup everywhere.
074325144X|5.0|Full disclosure: I took the workshop with Danny before I read the book. So my comments probably have less to do with the written presentation than with the technique itself.    I'm a casual runner - 4-6 miles, 3 days a week at most unless I'm training for a particular event. It's one of many things I do along with bicycling, aerobics, Pilates, strength training and kayaking. All my life I've been plagued with \\"overuse\\" (i.e. bad form) injuries - patellofemoral dysfunction, Achilles tendinitis, overpronation. With no other coaching than learning the Chi Running method, I no longer have to wear my patellofemoral straps and have no knee pain when I run. My Achilles are improving (more attention was required to my body mechanics in my other activities - but learning Chi Running helped me become aware of this as well). And I hope to someday wean myself off foot orthotics as other Chi Runners have done.    More importantly, Chi Running has made running feel good to me. Before, running was always a painful and rather unpleasant component to my cross-training, that I did because it was a cardio workout I could take with me wherever I travel. Now, I actually enjoy running, and I even competed in a 5K recently (and did rather well for being a very casual runner - top 20% in my age group and top third overall).    I think perhaps some of the critics are spending too much time thinking about the technique and not enough time feeling it in their body. I'm far from an accomplished Chi Runner, but it's really made a huge difference to me, and the more I refine my technique, the better it gets.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I am fan of the gangster film genre, and this ranks way high on that list (along with Goodfellas and City of God). It definitely has that Coen bro's  quirky touch, and with the great characters. It's very well acted, especially John Turturro, who has the most memorable scene (still frame of the is shown on front of the DVD cover). The story is very well layered, and like most Coen films it unfolds in an unorthodox manor, which will probably need more than one viewing to get the full narrative. This film isn't those for those looking for a violent shoot em up gangster movie (though it does have its moments, including a memorable tommy gun scene with the great Albert Finney), you will actually have to pay attention to the conversations and every action to get it. If you like Coen Bro's films, you must watch it.
0920668372|1.0|I got this book as a shower gift, and it looks so sweet.  It made me cry in a BAD way, not in a sentimental way.  Its weird and basically about the mother getting old and sickly and dying and leaving her son.  I don't want to think about getting old and leaving my new baby.  Just the worst book I've ever read.
B00122O34O|4.0|I saw this movie twice now.  The different music intrigued me the first time around.  They had played maybe two songs when I turned and whispered to my husband, \\"I love this!\\"  The second time around I listend for the music even closer.  I have struggled against my compulsion to buy this soundtrack because it is so different from the music I usually enjoy. (I'm a Tori Amos/Alanis Morisette/Old 97's kinda girl) Obviously I gave in!  I'm so glad I did.  I could listen to it all day.  The music from Kimya Dawson is the best on the compilation.  I suspect I will be buying her albums soon.  The song \\"Vampire\\" reminded me of my son's Backyardigan's CD's but when I played it for him, he didn't agree.  I researched it and learned it was a group effort between Kimya and a group of kids.  Also, I wanted to note that I think this music worked so well for the movie because Ellen Page suggested that her Juno character would have loved the Moldy Peaches and Kimya Dawson.  The director/producers took her suggestion and voila, a soundtrack that fit the movie perfectly was born.
B000NIVJGI|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies, so of course I had to buy it on Blu-Ray. As this is one of my favorite movies, the only thing to review is the image quality itself of the new Blu-ray transfer.     In that, the image quality is disappointing. It looks cleaner than the DVD version, but not up to par with available Blu-Ray movies from the same era, such as: First Blood, or even Enter the Dragon. The entire movie is full of aliasing in it. You can see it on people's collars, on the siding of houses. It is very noticeable and distracting, while muddling up details in the scenery shots. The colors are also off. The reds are pushed really high to where it makes anyone's red clothing stand out and the grass is slightly bluer than it should be. This effect is very noticeable in the scene just before Neil comes to recommend the Pachanga, where people are hopping around like kangaroos, one lady has red shorts and they look super-imposed over the bluish-green grass. Finally, there is also an issue with black levels that I have only seen on this BD. With my TV calibrated, I notice that the darkest spots were slightly brighter than the ones that weren't supposed to be as dark. When I turn the brightness up, they get even brighter. This issue forces me to watch it at a lower brightness than I would usually watch the movie in.    I was interested in the Blu-Trivia, but it wasn't that interesting. I distracted too much from the movie and was boring information, most of which wasn't anything that you couldn't easily find out if you wanted to.    I watched this on a PS3, so I'm not sure if it is PS3 specific or not; but while watching special features, I couldn't go to the menu. I had to skip to the end of the special to reach it.    So, it's difficult for me to say no to buying this because it is a cleaner transfer and sometimes, that bad colors actually look nice. But I'd say to wait until a better release comes along.
B00005R62N|5.0|as far as i know, this was the first album that was unrelenting metal from first song to last. no artsy stuff, no mood pieces, just pounding metal all the way through. want to hear early priest at their best, here it is.

0446577391|1.0|Not a bad story, but Baldacci has gone the way of James Patterson.  Short chapters, half-pages, jumpy story-line.  One of the things I liked about Baldacci was that he had his own style.  Now he has Patterson's instead.  I quit reading Patterson due to the cookie-cutter, half-page, short chapters - basically half a book in a whole-book price - and quality!  Now I may have to give up on Baldacci, too?!  Have to add - can't wait for the next Nelson DeMille!!
044661758X|5.0|This is the third installment in the Bosch series. Harry is in court because of a  civil suit resulting from his killing in the \\"Dollmaker\\" Case four years earlier. Now there is a copycat killer out there. As usual, Mr. Connelly does an excellent job of weaving the police procedural with his flawed,hero Harry Bosch. The plot twists and turns will keep you reading deep into the night.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is an incredible album that is best reviewed by simply saying: LISTEN!<br /><br />Written words would do no justice, but I'll throw a couple things out, anyway.<br /><br />This is the \\"Marillion\\" album for Radiohead.  You need to be familar with the great works of M over the last quarter century (or at least last decade) to understand, but if you like M, you'll love this album.  If you like this album, you will love (later) M.<br /><br />The marketing and packaging is interesting, but serves as a failed experiment.  I doubt artists will market low-quality digitunes and a DIY packaging again, but nice try.<br /><br />Oh, make sure you label the \\"eject\\" button on your CD player.  After you tire of the Radiohead album, you will have likely forgotten where eject is.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|I own all of Al Stewart's albums up till this one (yes - I even have The News From Spain).  I'd have to say that while each album had brilliant moments, Al progressed with every album, making this his most consistent, best produced, best written, and best performed.  Even though I used to think less of \\"Broadway Hotel\\" or even \\"On Stage Before\\", I've now come to believe that there is not a single weak track on it.  Phil Kenzie's tormented solo on the bitter-sweet, almost over-played Year of the Cat makes it a magical climax, but my favorite is arguably \\"Flying sorcery\\": the guitar solo soaring through crashing cymbals in the middle musical interlude is still a magical moment for me, and I often like to close my eyes when I sail through those 25 seconds.  \\"Call me if you ever need repair!\\"  Ah, those crazy youthful years gone by.  That leaves me thinking: should I buy Time Passages?  I really don't know the album at all, other than the title track, which is fine, but no Year of the Cat.  Thoughts, any one?
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I am a big fan of Jane Austen's works.  This version of Persuasion was very well done.  Rupert Penry-Jones was perfectly cast, a thoughtful and handsome hero.  Sally Hawkins did a fine job as well.  Next to  Pride and Prejudice (with Colin Firth), this is my favorite.
B000007O9L|4.0|There are interesting facts about the released of stripped:  - Basically it is an \\"unpugged album\\" from the Stones.  - It was the very first interactive cd.    When I first bought this cd, it was the very first interactive multimedia record ever done (booklet came with instructions, intercative material, etc...also appears the very first Rolling stones site, by 1994 whe the internet was so new, the site shows only merchandise in just a few pages, all those years ago), it is very interesting looking and hearing \\"hidden tracks\\".   Also, during the Voodoo Lounge tour, the Stones perform some \\"surprise gigs\\" in some cities.  In the time of the Unplugged records, this is a testimony of great tracks recorded in a different way we used to hear the Stones.     It is a great album, quite diferent, and of course \\"Like a Rolling Stones\\", a classic made a classic.
B000O76TAE|5.0|What we have here is over 2 hours of film, the bulk of which involves a single actor at a single location with very little in the way of dialog. Heck, one of the most important characters in the film is a volleyball. This is also a great demonstration as to how a good creative team can take something like that and make it work so amazingly well.<br /><br />I'm not sure this could have worked with any actor other than Tom Hanks. Many actors would love to boast that they alone could carry a film, but here Tom Hanks actually does just that by effectively playing the sole character in the film for roughly 3/4ths the films total length.<br /><br />The sense of realism represented in the film in pretty much every respect is amazing. I've never been in a plane crash, but I imagine the depiction we see here has more basis in reality than the flashy effects sequences usually see in film. I also loved that they didn't try to make the island out to be some tropical paradise with postcard shots and filtering. It's obviously a nice location, but they appropriately didn't emphasize that as that would negatively effect the films atmosphere. The trials he faces are a tad basic, but yet the two hours flies by before you know it due to a great script and an amazing performance from Hanks. The score is also minimalistic, likely because filling the scenes with music might effect the sense of isolation you are supposed to have. All in all I loved the art direction they took with the film.<br /><br />The metal case this version of the film arrives in is great. The insert is nothing amazing but they did well with the special features. Sure, they're nothing that will leave you in awe, but it's enough to give you some insight on the films production and regarding the subject matter itself. I was a huge skeptic when I first heard about this one, but through an amazing creative team and a great performance by Hanks I can hardly imagine them pulling it off any better.
B000UVLK1M|4.0|The sophistication of Mitchell's song constructions provides a plethora of interpretive possibilities.  Hancock heads for the Ritz-Carlton.  With guest vocalists Norah Jones, Tina Turner, Corinne Bailey Rae, Luciana Souza, and Joni herself, Hancock dances gracefully up and down the twisting staircases of Mitchell's melodies, crossing the ballroom again and again for yet another chic-to-chic peek at her poetry.  It's all gleaming wood and polished elegance, even as Wayne Shorter's sax prods Hancock on to more adventurous turns of phrase.  The disc closes with Leonard Cohen's guttural narration of Mitchell's \\"The Jungle Line,\\" a fittingly odd close to an album idolizing an iconoclast.  A celebration of subtlety.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Figured it looked like time for a real review of this film. I'll start off by responding to one of the previous criticisms in that this release is only available in full screen. Well, widescreen was pretty much non-existent at the time this film came out and the first film Disney did for widescreen theaters was Lady and the Tramp, this movie was never widescreen.<br /><br />That aside this is truly a Disney classic, it has a great cast of characters and follows a somewhat skit style in that the film is mostly seperated in to individual encounters, each one as entertaining as those before it. There's some musical portions and comedic portions which usually border on the wierd side of the comedy spectrum, but not in a bad way.<br /><br />The story is used more as a means to facilitate the encounters rather than serve as a focus for the audience, which actually works quite well in making the film enjoyable but not overly dramatic. The animation is very well done for its day and it has a few decent extra's that consist mostly of old TV spots and shows from when Alice was released.
0385336691|5.0|a good addition to a lee child collection. jack reacher is a rounded character, charming and human enough to carry you along. we don't usually buy books in this genre but child wears well. for one thing, he's literate and he can spin a yarn, however preposterous. if you can suspend your scepticism, accept tongue-in-cheek coincidence - hey, shakespeare used it to death! - here's a good book for your crime shelf and a reread on a winter's evening.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|This is a nice mellow album from Miles Davis. It really relaxes me. I think that this is one of the greatest albums of all-time and it is in my opinion in the same catogory as Kind of Blue, Miles Smiles, and Afro-Cuban Jazz Moods. His trumpet is great on this album. And there are two songs on this album both 20 minutes making it up to 40 minutes of music. Anything instrumental is best for me. Anyways this album is for all rock fans who need to relax. No CD collection is complete without this and Kind of Blue. Highly recommended.
068483605X|5.0|This book is timeless. Grabbed me as it did so many decades ago. A great read for young and old and - getting rare these days - offers plenty to chew on. Long may these rabbits live!
1401302378|5.0|The ideas in this book are so true. You can make more money at serving multiple niche audiences than one large audience. The book rings true especially for online entities. Great ideas and you get the gist quickly when you first start reading the book.
0307237702|4.0|Barack Obama is highly intelligent and has charisma and he truly talks in a way that you can relate to what his agenda will be as President and what he envisions. he touches on many themes in this Book and he is always direct and so focused but yet he is cool.  he has overcome so much and you feel his Journey is truly only just starting out.  i dig his outline and what he hopes to accomplish and you truly feel where he is coming from.  the Soul Brother is One sharp cat. He is a Breath of Fresh Air.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|The Collector's edition provides everything you might remotely want to know about this classic film.    The Blu-ray video transfer is razor sharp and the surround sound is compelling.    The only thing that could have added to the Collector's edition would be if the producers of the Collector's addition could have persuaded Harrison Ford to provide an audio commentary track.

B00005JLKN|5.0|\\"Red Dragon\\", the movie, is truly delicious.  It stays true to the brilliant Thomas Harris novel of the same name.  I can't help but chortle with wild, almost maniacal glee as I write this review!    \\"Red Dragon\\" is my favorite of the three Harris novels.    The primary reason the story is so thrilling is because of our fascination with the larger-than-life and yet largely believable character that Harris created in Hannibal Lecter.    Lecter's brilliance borders on the supernatural.  He is a top-notch psychiatrist, a superb twelve-fingered pianist, a culinary genius, a lover and master of art and literature with an encyclopedic knowledge of both genres.  He can be exquisitely charming and charismatic, serenely at home in aristocratic society.  And though larger-than-life, Lector is presented him in such a way that one accepts that such a man could be.  Harris manipulates the audience so that the audience revels lovingly and satisfyingly in the deception.    A flaw in such a superlative person might make him human.  Lecter's `flaw' makes him a Monster.    The flaw?  Lecter likes to brutally kill and occasionally eat the odd acquaintance.  He kills primarily for pleasure, but we find that the world may indeed be better off with the deletions Lecter chooses.  His victims include an incurable pedophile, an out-of-tune flautist, an out-of-season deer hunter, a serial killer, and so on.  There is a lyrical, intelligent quality to the killings of Hannibal Lecter.    Add to this FBI Special Agent Will Graham who has the gift and the tragedy of being able to put himself inside the mind of a killer.  Then switch burners so the Monster Lecter is actually `helping' the FBI to catch another killer, Francis Dolarhyde, ruthless and yet pitiable in his efforts to contain his own psychotic demons as he allows a seductive coworker to eroticize him, possibly the first time for both of them.    Stir all this up and you get a meaty brew, rich with flavor and texture.    Dolarhyde's plan to take the blind girl on a date to `see' a live tiger was spell binding.  What an electrifying romantic date!  And it certainly had its affect on the blind girl.  We could see that if not for things beyond his control, Dolarhyde may have developed into a handsome, charming, thoughtful, charismatic suitor to this woman.    Lector goads Dolarhyde into killing the unsavory Freddy Lounze in a most agonizing and exquisite way.  Like the investigators, we squirm in our chairs upon hearing the recording of a lipless, perhaps tongue-less Freddy, screaming, writhing in pain, sans fricative consonants.  And yet we feel that in some way, Freddy met with his end justly.    Thomas Harris' brilliance is first in his creation of such detailed memorable characters as Graham, Lecter and Dolarhyde and then in his ability to allow the reader to identify with each.  He sautés these characters (the way Lecter would) into a brilliant, epicurean story to complete the tasty dish.  Slurp.    Director Bret Ratner sounded like an impostor during the commentary; I couldn't persuade myself that this dolt, excuse me, had directed this great movie.  He sounded goofy, always iterating sophomoric quips like \\"Oh!  I really like THIS scene...\\"  And, unbelievably, he confesses that he doesn't even understand the tiger scene, one of my favorites, and one that I felt was essential to understanding the complexity of the Dolarhyde character.  Who really directed this movie?      I guess the proof is in the pudding.  I applaud the fact that this movie was true to Harris' novel.  It helped relieve the heartburn I got when I tried to digest \\"Manhunter\\", the first cinematic attempt of Harris' \\"Red Dragon\\", which completely charred the storyline.    I felt that excellent performances were turned in by all the major actors, including Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson.    This film is very highly recommended.    -Viddy
B00005LIN0|2.0|One would think it fairly difficult to go wrong with anything Gershwin, but not so.  This production of Porgy and Bess makes for disappointing viewing. The performers have great voices, but their voices are drowned out by tinny, loud orchestral music that sounds as if it were recorded in a metal box and then laid over the vocals. The instrumental music sounds totally disconnected from the vocals. It is so loud that much of the time the words being sung cannot be understood. The sound problems strongly detract from my overall enjoyment of the production.      I also am disappointed with the unnecessary swearing in this production, as well as the fact that Porgy is on two feet, even if aided by canes. I will not give away the ending to those who are not familiar with Porgy and Bess, but this version does not end as other versions I am familiar with.      None of these complaints are meant to detract from the quality of singing and acting, which is very good indeed. Marietta Simpson's portrayal of Maria is noteworthy as is Gregg Baker as Crown.
B0009MAO46|5.0|This is an instant hit with my kids.  The toys come alive when humans are not around.  It makes for interesting conversation to say the least.  I've even found my kids talking to their toys - just to see if they will come alive.    Great animation, great for all ages.  Wonderful movie.
0345350499|2.0|I love fantasy--and usually gobble up the best of the genre within a couple of days. \\"Mists,\\" however, was a very difficult book endure.     I found the characters shallow, unlikeable and heartless. Morgaine, the protagonist, was weak, confused, amoral and inconsistently drawn. And she was about the best of the lot. Bradley hid her frail characters behind a mist of voodoo magic and New Age mistique... Peel that away, and there wasn't much of a story left.    On the bright side, at least \\"Mists\\" wasn't riddled with grammatical errors. (However, in my view, removing a good 500 pages from the book would have been a wise move on the editing front.)    In a nutshell: Hopeless, disturbing, confusing and dark... And far, far too long.     Honestly, I'd rather have a root canal than slog through \\"Mists of Avalon\\" again.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of the best Pixar films I've seen.  It rates right up there with Cars.  The animation is fantastic, it tells a great story and keeps you engaged.  My little ones love the film and watch it over and over and over and over.    It is a great movie for long car trips.  Also, if you goto Epcot, take a look at the Finding Nemo ride.  It is fantastic as well, and goes hand in hand with the movie.  Nothing scary in the film, so it is ok with all ages.

B000I2IT44|5.0|Porcupine Tree rock hard and sound just as great live as they do on disc. The jams are amazing and take me back to the days of Pink Floyd, Rush, Yes, and all the other greats in the classic rock genre they're so obviously influenced by. I've said before how much I hope how one day rock'n'roll will become mainstream again where countless bands will be dominating radio stations and selling records as they put forth their style and message to influence a generation, and when that happens, I can't think of a better band than Porcupine Tree to receive credit as a band who always had the vision to keep rock music valued and appreciated. Watch this concert and you'll see what I mean.

B000Z6MIQS|5.0|I really enjoyed this cd ater listening it for the first time today (Friday, Feb. 14th).  I had just picked it up from Target for just as great as the price of Amazon (+ a bonus Target only DVD).  The songs are all meaningful, melodic, rhythmic, and a little different than SP's regular pop/alternative/punk rock style of a few years ago. Don't worry, it's still good and refreshing material.    My favorite songs include:    Take My Hand    Save You    Time to Say Goodbye    I Can Wait Forever    What if.    More tom.    What If

0061122416|5.0|Paulo Coehlo's books are either semi-biographical (\\"The Zahir\\", \\"The Pilgrimage\\") or inspirational fables (\\"The Witch of Portobello Road\\", \\"By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept\\"). \\"The Alchemist\\" falls into the latter category.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" was a runaway bestseller in Latin America before taking English-speaking spiritual seekers by storm. It is the tale of an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, whose impulse to travel to the Egyptian pyramids in search of his destiny (which Coehlo called a 'Personal Legend') subjects him to a series of lessons in humility, patience, faith, and loyalty, all disguised as exotic adventures. In seeking worldly success, Santiago learns to overcome adversity, believe in his own personal power, and re-value the often ridiculed concept of dreams.<br /><br />Coehlo is not a 'self help' author like Dr. Wayne Dyer or Carolyn Myss: he doesn't pose a series of recommended steps for confidence recovery or spiritual enlightenment. His is more of a \\"show us, don't tell us\\" method of instruction, and it works. Just as Aesop framed moral lessons in the form of a story, Paulo Coehlo uses powerful parables to show the way to self-empowerment.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The 5 disk Blade Runner collectors edition has the unreleased workprint version of the movie that is different from any released version. That was for test audiences before Blade Runner was released. Also on the 5 disk is a special features that show Harrison Ford's son, Ben, re-filming one of his dads shots that has a blooper and Joanna Cassidy fixing that stunt double blooper. The deleated scene feature is over an hour long and has narration by Ford never heard before and many never seen scenes including a nude Sean Young and not rape romance scene with her. Many goodies including a toy spinner car. Love it.
0800141849|5.0|I loved this movie.  Barbara Streisand is an excellent actress and does herself proud.  Jeff Bridges who in my opinion is one of the very best actors around and should have won an oscar for his role in this movie and also STARMAN.  I think he has been overlooked or something.  I love the expressions he can get on his face and he is a natural.  I saw this on TV twice and just ordered the DVD.  Its a keeper.....one I will watch over and over again.
0066620996|2.0|Let me explain...<br /><br />Consulting firms have their place in the business world. These organizations abound with brainpower armed with advanced academic degrees. That's wonderful. Most of the time, these firms do a great job of providing insightful answers to problems that bedevil management. When management is too close to the trees to be able to objectively evaluate the challenges confronting them, consultants can be a big help.<br /><br />What's the connection? This book and its companion follow-up best-seller, \\"Built to Last,\\" were written by consultants. Mr. Jim Collins, a former McKinsey consultant, authored this singlehandedly and, for the second, co-authored it with Mr. Porras.<br /><br />\\"The Halo Effect\\" was written by a business professor named Rosenzweig.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743291255 The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers]]<br /><br />Professor Rosenzweig held \\"Good to Great\\" and \\"Built to Last\\" as the primary subjects of his argument about the \\"halo effect.\\"<br /><br />The good professor points out that both tomes used hindsight to unearth the success factors that made the companies in their respective lists such standouts. The problem with that approach, Rosenzweig points out, is that hindsight--as the saying goes--is 20/20.<br /><br />Take two boys who grow up in the same village. One becomes the company president while the other never rises beyond the rank of a junior manager. From the vantage point of the villagers, could they have foreseen who was going to become what? Maybe but probably not. On the other hand, if that question was tackled by starting from the present and then having their careers retraced back to their youth, the factors that made them into what they are can be easily discovered.<br /><br />That's the fallacy inherent in basing one's analysis on hindsight. You'll always come up with the answers.<br /><br />Are they the correct answers? Not necessarily. Assume, for example, that the president rose through the financial ranks of the company. Does the fact that he graduated with an accounting degree constitute a valid success factor? Of course not. If that accounting degree was present in the biographies of 99 other company presidents, does that now make it a valid success factor? I still think not. And yet that's how the authors of both books presented their case. They used an expanded sample population and retraced the path of each company that made it to each book's list. They then isolated the factors that appeared in every company's path. Aha!, they said. These are the common factors that propelled these companies into our list. Now, they stated, we know what works. From that, the authors proceeded to make broad extrapolations about how the reader might use these factors to make their own companies successful.<br /><br />I did what the professor did. I checked the standing of most of the companies in this first book. I came up with a review of mixed results. Using the same measure that the book used, some companies were doing well, most had become average, and a few were lagging.<br /><br />An even easier way to check the validity of these so-called success factors is to compare the list in both books. Surely a company that had transitioned from good to great would stay great enough to ensure that it was built to last. Right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />I have to agree with the professor. There is no success formula embodied in the advice proffered by the book. Those nuggets of advice are misleading. The advice is misleading because their source--the research results--are flawed. The research results are flawed because the research assumption is flawed. What is that assumption? It differs slightly for these two books but it could be roughly stated as such: \\"Isolate the common factors behind the success of these companies--the ones that made it to our list. Extrapolate the lessons from those few common factors and write a best-seller.\\" Or two.<br /><br />And that's exactly what he/they did!<br /><br />I've read both books and I'm certain the reader will learn new things from each one. However, after reading \\"The Halo Effect\\" (and agreeing with it), I know now that neither \\"Good to Great\\" nor \\"Built to Last\\" reveal any good, great, or everlasting secrets of business success.<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />Jim Collins is an alumnus of the prestigious consulting firm, McKinsey & Co. The firm publishes The McKinsey Quarterly, a newsletter akin to the Harvard Business Review. The first issue of the 2007 newsletter (2007 number 1) contains an adaptation of the book, \\"The Halo Effect.\\" The article (mercifully) omits mentioning either of these two books, maybe because its author was one of their own.new things from each one.

B0012QE4OO|3.0|It is finally here--the first mega-budget, CGI-laden, \\"blockbuster\\" of the year, but its' jump falls short of great, and lands on moderate instead.<br /><br />David Rice (played Hayden Christensen) learns at age fifteen he as the ability to teleport anywhere, through anything, at anytime. He quickly learns how to harness his power and control it, and then before long he as robbed a bank and is on his way to the \\"good life\\". Fast-forward  till he is older, he now has a dream apartment in New York and spends his days trotting the globe--breakfast in Paris, surfing in Fiji, lunch on top of the Sphinx, one night stand in London, etc.--you get the picture.<br /><br />He returns home wanting to find his high school crush, Millie (played by Rachel Bilson). He finds her working at the local bar and obviously wants to share his dream-existence with her. There lies a big problem as she quickly suspects something, and before he has time to explain everything to her his \\"perfect\\" existence is suddenly threatened.<br />It is threatened by a detective Roland (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who is investing the first bank robbery, and slowly starts tracking David. Roland knows about these \\"jumpers\\", and tracks them down to kill them reminding each one repeatedly \\"Only God should have the power....\\" As he gets closer to David and his loved ones, the film accelerates into a blinding pace of \\"jumping\\" action until the end which neatly setup a new franchise.<br /><br />Because of its' poor script, direction, and editing, the special effects and settings are what make this film good. Yes we have seen other superheroes teleport, but I do not remember ever seeing Night-crawler lounging in a beach chair on top of the Sphinx's head or riding thirty-foot waves in Fiji. Watching him do everything you could ever want with this new power is what makes it entertaining, as you anticipate the next destination you will be whisked off to.<br /><br />Hayden Christensen proves he really can act after, and he gives a solid performance, although Jamie Bell (playing another jumper) steals any and all scenes he appears in with his intense, energetic, comic-relief presence. Diane Lane's cameo is a pleasant surprise, and Rachel Bilson's performance as the girlfriend is sincere.<br /><br />My main complaint was the ending, which is so happily clique and a blatant setup for a sequel it leaves you with the feeling \\"that's it?\\" I still liked it. Overall this is a pure popcorn, eye-candy thriller that is entertaining enough if you do not try to think about it to hard, and can hold you over till this Summer's \\"real\\" blockbusters!ance, although Jamie Bell (playing another jumper) steals any and all scenes he appears in with his intense, energetic, comic-relief presence.

B000GPIPT2|1.0|ive recieved this item and returned it 3 times already and i am still not happy and its too late to exchange it again so now im stuck.  everytime i recieve this dvd its been damaged.  mostly to do with the casing.  its been damaged i think by bad shipping tecniques or something.  also bad cover design.  although the cover looks cool......it always falls apart first time you open it or there are major cuts in it.  the movie itself is a classic and is awesome.  just wish they packaged it differently.  especially for those like myself who love movies and collect them.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Excellent acting from Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe and others.  Strange though to see Denzel Washington acts the bad guy, the drug dealer.  That makes the whole movie less convincing, albeit it's based on a true story.  Overall, an okay movie, although I believe director Ridley Scott had a bigger ambition.
B00009MGGI|5.0|\\"House of Cards Trilogy\\" is wonderfully written and performed.  I had never seen it before, but saw that it was a favored Masterpiece Theater.

B00000J7J4|5.0|[[VIDEOID:18388511]]I've been a Santana fan since Woodstock but not through thick and thin, so I wasn't current when this album came out, but it really caught my ear and I like almost everything on it. It's one of my favorite albums overall. Santana from several eras is great for jumping rope to.
B00068NVI4|3.0|I've been a Yes fan since I bought their first album in 1969, and it's heartening to see these guys still playing this wonderful music. This video is well staged and well shot, and the band plays and sings exceptionally well, even if Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman appear to be bored (appearance only; their playing certainly is sharp). Unfortunately, the whole thing is let down by some of the worst sound I've ever heard in a live performance. The whole thing is mud--compressed, confused, and cloudy. Individual parts occasionally stick out from the murk, but only just. An example: Alan White, in addition to his drumset, is surrounded by giant bulbous drums that appear to be designed by Roger Dean, used only in the intro to Sweet Dreams. At that point there is no one else playing, just White, and all of those big drums are being played by remote beaters. Presumably it sounded impressive in person, but here there is no hint of any sound coming from those drums. It's a completely mystery how the sound mixer could screw that up--there was no other instrument to balance it against! This music is complex, with lots of interlocking parts, and each of the players is usually playing something unusual, so it's all the more important that the sound be clear and clean, and all the more disappointing to find it so muddy. Note to sound man: Yours IS a Disgrace.    The DVD is still worth owning, though, for the visuals, which actually help you interpret what people are playing, like reading lips.
0060930187|5.0|This is a masterpiece, well written, extremely well organized contemporary style book. It is often compared to The Catcher in the Rye, while I think that the angst in this book isn't so apparent.

B000092T6M|5.0|I felt that the original movie was probably one of the best written and and had the top actors of the decade. It was one of my favorites growing up and almost everyone I've ever mentioned it to loved it. This collector's set is truly a gift to the fans. It had hours and hours of extra features. ETC: interviews with the cast pre and post produciton of the film, making of, documentaries, a history of Robin Hood, and live performances from Ireland with Bryan Adams performing the hit single from the movie. I've looked around for this set since it was released a couple of years ago, but it flew off the shelves. Now it's even harder to find because theyve taken the original DVD casing and put it with a Kevin Costner set, so if you can find this. Grab it while you can, I promise you wont be disappointed.

When I first listened to Sky Blue Sky, I liked what I heard, and even picked out 3 favorite songs right off.    Now I have listened to the album at least 15 times and feel that Wilco is both branching out to new sounds and refining their old style.  They have really found their niche.    This album is definately Wilco.  If you liked Hotel Foxtrot, on whole, you will like this album.  Give it at least 3 listens before deciding whether it is your favorite Wilco album or not.

B00000ILGL|5.0|This 1977 proudly boasts that it was made completely and solely with keyboards.  At over 30 years old, this is an impressive album that surpasses the disco cheese and looks ahead to the trance of 20 years later.<br /><br />Plenty of Moroder magic, relentless sequences, thumping drum machine, fat bass lines.  Picks up with Los Angeles and then Utopia, which sounds very trance-like before the disco chorus breaks in and you start thinking of those coordinated dances from the movies.  Nevertheless, very enjoyable, fun album that dates very well--surprised this hasn't been re-released or re-imagined with some updated sounds.<br /><br />Was given new life and exposure with the game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories as it supplies most of the music for Flash FM.  Now available a bit cheaper on disc and well worth it for house, trance, and electronic fans.  Moroder fans, too, naturally.

0375842209|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in ages...No book has made me feel the emotions of Nazi Germany like this.  We see a world where children are still trying to be children, even though they are experiencing tragedy, disappointment and loss all around them.  It is an uplifting testimony of the human heart, compassion and morality woven into a brilliant story told by the narrator, death.  An excellent novel, I highly recommend it!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Every genre of music has its teenage artist.  Pop has its assorted personas such as Hilary Duff, jazz has Renee Olstead, and new age has Kelly Sweet, but country has Taylor Swift.  Though only 18, she has a voice that rivals country doyennes such as Reba McEntire and Carrie Underwood.  \\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\" is bar none the best song on the disc, so full of grace that a pop remix was even created for Top 40 radio.  Even though the songs sound innocent enough, they are hardly bubblegum, thanks to Taylor's beyond her years tone.  This girl is really going places with this album.  It'll knock your socks off.

0887307280|5.0|Did you ever wonder how you can get the same Big Mac from any McDonald's anywhere in the world?  Michael Gerber demystifies this by showing that the systems and processes are what makes the business a business, and not just a job for the owner.  And how the complications of running every aspect of a business can be broken down into uniformly performed functions - the way a franchise is.<br /><br />The \\"E\\" stands for entrepreneurial and the myth is that most owners are not entrepreneurs but someone who just works in a business where the owner has himself for a boss instead of somebody else. He shows how you can break out of the mold of working in the business to working on the business by establishing the right processes and operating procedures.  In effect, he tells you to set up your business the way a franchise is set up - where anyone properly and easily trained can do any job to sell, produce and ship the product and handle the business aspects of operating a business.<br /><br />I make this book required reading for the clients of my CPA practice and highly recommend it to anyone running a business or organization, or wanting to.
0765316978|5.0|Very good story line.  This Author is one to keep an eye on.  He has taken the Heinlein Starship Troopers novel and made a series out of it with a few twists.  Very nice universe/multiverse he has made (also a Heinlein idea).

B000B0QOJA|3.0|On this album you take the good with the bad.<br /><br />On both this and [[ASIN:B000QFAG2Q My Favorite Things: Coltrane at Newport]], McCoy is an annoyance. Here he is able to warp space and time so that 5 to 7-minute solos feel like an hour. My Favorite Things on this disc is a bit of a throwaway, which isn't something one says very often. McCoy takes an incredibly long and tedious solo, then John comes back in only to be faded out as the radio announcer talks over him until the tracks ends. I find it no coincidence that on this and the Newport mentioned above, the best tracks (One Down here, Impressions there) are without McCoy for about 3/4s of each track.<br /><br /> Here in March and May of '65 Coltrane has moved ahead but McCoy and Elvin are doing what they'd always done, which often feels out of place within the context of John's visions for '65/'66. Five seconds after McCoy lays out altogether in One Down, the tune takes off with Coltrane and Jimmy as co-pilots. Then Jimmy lays out and Coltrane really manhandles this tune, scouring the outer fringes of what was possible on tenor in '65. This is some of the most forward, devious, beautiful stuff he ever played. Even though there must be 15 mins of this as a John & Elvin duo, it's oftentimes not a duo. It's John soloing... playing solely from inside himself while Elvin tries to keep up. John has passages of minutes upon minutes of brilliance here but it seems that had he stopped soloing 10 minutes earlier, Elvin would have been pleased it was over. There's not much give-and-take here. John's playing is visionary while Elvin often seems to be playing because John hadn't stopped yet.<br /><br />Still, Elvin isn't as big a problem. In '65, McCoy put a damper on almost everything he touched, and this entire album is no exception. That makes this album an essential though mixed bag. John is on fire. His playing on One Down and Song of Praise is heroic. These are why he is thought of as some sort of mystical legend in human form, but god help me, every solo McCoy takes on both discs makes me wish he'd have been sick and not even shown up for the gigs. He was great in earlier years and even handles himself well on [[ASIN:B000003N8P Meditations]] but for the most part he was in dire need of being replaced by Alice well before it happened.<br /><br />Garrison deserves any praise or respect he receives. He could hang with (and propel) anything John did from '60 to '67. Get this for the individual contributions of John & Jimmy but don't expect a John Coltrane \\"band\\" at its pinnacle.help me, every solo McCoy takes on both discs makes me wish he'd have been sick and not even shown up for the gigs.

B00133KFGW|5.0|Went in knowing this movie was sentimental, plot-simple and without a close hold on reality.  Fair enough. Instead you suspend believe, get caught up in the story's mystical web and are transported to a land where dreams come true and the bonds of love and music draw you in completely.      The eclectic music was brilliant and mezmerizing.  The cinematography was thoughtful and well edited.  The actors were all well cast, (including   minor and supporting) all were compelling and believabvle in their parts, especially the brilliant young actor, Freddie Highmore who plays the boy music prodigy. The story builds at a nice pace, including the dramas of finding and losing throughout.  Sure the ending is predictable, but who cares when you have already been drawn in and you are rooting for that predictable end to happen?  It is magical and totally engaging, the kind of movie that makes you want to clap at the end (which my daughter and I did as did others in the theater.)  The trouble with critics (who see way too  many movies) is that they have lost their sense of wonder and delight, having already been there and done that from their perspective.    AUGUST RUSH was never meant to succeed on its plot.  It is the execution that makes all the difference.  As previously stated, when all the cinematic elements are right on:  acting, cinematography, editing, casting, music, direction, set and location, the result is a winner  The movie is refreshingly rated PG with nothing to offend anyone.   5 stars! Bravo!

B0004Z33EG|5.0|Hollywood films have brought us some of the most memorable heroes over the years that have found themselves a place within our collective hearts and minds. Whether these heroes be adapted from books, comic books, video games, or real life, they each have several traits in common in which we all relate; from their capacity for good, to trying their best to do what's right, and of course, no matter the obstacles set before them, always fight for those that cannot fight for themselves. Each of our cinematic heroes always seems to embody the very best in all of us. Among the ranks of cinema's greatest heroes is a character that was born from a novel by writer David Morrell, and at first glance didn't seem destined to be the great action hero he later became over the course of three sequels. The character I am referring to is the other most popular character that Sylvester Stallone embodied outside of boxer Rocky Balboa, none other than John Rambo, the Vietnam veteran and former Green Beret, who wanted nothing more than to find acceptance from the very country that he had fought and bled for when it needed him most. Of course, Rambo never would have become the hero we love if not for the excellent film that started it all, \\"First Blood\\" from director Ted Kotcheff (\\"Uncommon Valor\\") that introduced audiences to the tortured soul of a man simply looking for a place to belong.    \\"First Blood\\" is the story of Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who is traveling the country trying to find former brothers-in-arms; instead, all he finds is heartache as each and every one of his friends from the war have died, leaving him all alone in a world that seems it would rather forget he and his kind ever existed. As he walks into a small town looking for a bite to eat, the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) deems him to be a disturbance and proceeds to usher him quickly out of town. However, Rambo refuses and is subsequently arrested for vagrancy, but after the local police makethe terrible mistake of mistreating their newest prisoner, Rambo feels that his only course of action is to free himself of their custody, and flee to the surrounding woods. As the local police are hunting him, Rambo's splintered mind is taking him back to his time as a Green Beret, and all of his lethal training begins to take over. Realizing the high cost of their mistake, the police turn to a man who knows John Rambo all too well, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who desperately wants to ensure Rambo's safe apprehension, while at the same time averting anymore bloodshed before it's too late. Now, in a strange town, surrounded by people who appear to hate and fear him, Rambo believes he is fighting a new kind of war and he will stop at nothing to survive, and ultimately win.    \\"First Blood\\" is an engaging look at the trauma many veterans face upon returning home and finding that the reception isn't quite what they expect it to be. The film examines not only the ramifications of war on those who proudly serve their country in times of need, but also what could happen when a man is pushed too far and what he may be willing to do to protect himself. It is surprising that the serious topic of how we as a country have treated our veterans, namely those of the Vietnam War, is front and center in this action-packed film. It is this higher quality storytelling that elevates \\"First Blood\\" into becoming much more than your average action movie.    The superior quality of the story for the film came from author David Morrell, who wrote the original novel the film was based upon, it was then adapted into a screenplay by writers Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Sylvester Stallone. Though I've read that the film differs in numerous places from the book, if not for that initial novel this film may not have had the same level of depth, social commentary, and realism that made \\"First Blood\\" so much better than other action movies of its time. Assisting in the quality of the film, was the solid, no frills direction from director Ted Kotcheff, who by choosing to film on location imbued the film with a gritty, natural feeling in tone that could not have been captured as easily on a back lot of some studio in Hollywood.    The acting from Sylvester Stallone was some of the best he has ever done in any of his films. We all knew from his 'Rocky' series of films that he could handle the action scenes and even the dramatic ones, but it was the pure emotion he brought to the character that was so surprising, especially in that riveting final scene in the police station. Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy were superb in their supporting roles as Colonel Trautman and Sheriff Teasle. Crenna created a pseudo-father figure for Rambo with Trautman, and provided audiences, along with the characters in the movie, the interesting insights into the possible mindset of Rambo, and also just what exactly he is capable of. As a credit to his talent, Crenna's character of Trautman not only became one of his most popular characters throughout his entire career, but his character's brief moments of exposition may have been the key point in the film in which Rambo went from being just a misunderstood war veteran, to one of Hollywood's iconic heroes. Brian Dennehy was perfect as the seemingly good natured Sheriff when we first meet him, to becoming the slimy villain, who along with the rest of his police force, embodied the viewpoint of the numerous protestors to the Vietnam War and its veterans, and all others who have judged rather than respect our veterans throughout the history of our country.    \\"First Blood\\" is an extremely well made survival-themed adventure film that is full of intensity, drama, and exhilarating action sequences that will have you riveted until the film's final moments. A must-see for all action movie fans and is an exciting opening chapter to one of Hollywood's most action-packed franchises. As a tribute to just how enduring the character of Rambo is within Hollywood, 2008 saw the return of the hero in the appropriately titled \\"Rambo\\", the fourth film in the franchise, and the first 'Rambo' film in 20 years.    \\"First Blood\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.
0393312836|4.0|While I enjoyed the story and the point the author makes, the book was rough going because of the nonsensical slang. Although it is an integral part of the tale, it makes it very difficult to read and understand clearly.<br /><br />The commentary provided on the moral and ethical questions regarding punishment and social justice is very insightful, made even more so by the ending which was excluded from the original release here in America and as a corollary Kubrick's film.

I couldn't believe the vocal ability she had and she was only 15 years old at the time. Thanks to Amazon I was able to find a complete album of her songs with many great classics which she more than does justice to. This is a multi-talented performer who has a great future in both acting and singing. She has a kind of jazz/classical style with amazing range and lyric interpretation that is unbelievable. I hope to see more albums from Ms. Olstead. If you want to hear a great vocalist belt out the great classics, buy this album right away. You won't be disappointed.

Diana Wynne Jones writes an amazing, refreshing, and charming love story with masterful character development.  I was thoroughly captivated by Howl as he matured and became a man/wizard capable of a true love relationship.  And Sophie's character was so complex that the unwinding of her personality, with it's twists and turns was a delight to experience with her.  All the characters in this book were well-developed and a joy to meet.  This book was so much better than the movie, that I find myself wondering why the movie took such a departure from an almost perfect story.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|The movie Once is excellent -- I can't recommend it enough.  However the DVD isn't Macintosh friendly at all.  The cover of the DVD prominently displays \\"Free Song\\".  Once the DVD was in my computer there was no easily apparent free song.  After awhile fishing around I found a readme buried several levels deep on the disc.      It says:     \\"PC users should find that the ROM content menu automatically launches when the disc is inserted into their DVD-ROM drive\\"    \\"MAC users may access the ROM content menu by double clicking the index.htm file or by dragging it to their favorite web browser window.\\"    Once the Mac user finds the index.htm file (in another directory) and opens it in their browser, then clicks the download song link, it does not work.  I found the song on the DVD in a .zip file, which when expanded can be dragged into iTunes.  Though note that it is a PC .wav format, which only plays in the most recent versions of iTunes.  From there it can be converted to an Apple uncompressed .AIF, or compressed .AAC or .MP3 formats.      Nothing like making you work a bit for your extra!    Again, excellent, excellent movie and a DVD that was clearly made with little, if any consideration for Macintosh users.
B00005JLK1|1.0|The title caught my imagination. I watched it the theatre with high expectation. I was disappointed after 30 minutes in to the movie. There were only a couple of scary scenes. There's no suspense. It's so bad I did not care what happened for the last 45 minutes.
B000000XBC|3.0|Chronicles 2 is the second installment of Creedence Clearwater's greatest hits.  Chronicles 2 has many great songs, its just not the best of CCR'  What really amazes me is......it is very obvious that they left Born on the Boyou off of Chronicles so they had a hook to get you to buy this second edition. It may or not be good business but it is dishonest.  If you want the best of CCR get Chronicles....if you want great songs, but not the very best, get this.  John Fogerty is so good and CCR was so good, you will still enjoy this CD.

1594489505|1.0|I can see I'm in the minority here and am baffled by that. I loved The Kite Runner and was engaged from page one. It was not only beautifully written but it told a gripping, believable story with well-drawn, interesting characters.<br />I read 100 pages of A Thousand Splendid Suns, just to be sure I gave it a fair shot. I thought any minute it would grab me, but it never did. The story is slow and boring. The characters have no depth, no redeeming qualities, they're not likeable, especially Mariam, the main character. I wanted to like her, to relate to her, but I couldn't. All the characters are one-dimensional.<br />I'm not saying this to be funny or snide but I find it hard to believe the same person wrote both books. The Kite Runner was technically beautiful while A Thousand Splendid Suns is very basic creative writing 101. Truly, I think someone else wrote this book.<br />To get all this critical acclaim I'm thinking something terribly exciting must happen on page 101 but since I could only manage 100 pages I'll never find out what it is.
B0010ZR160|4.0|\\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a gritty modern detective story based on Dennis Lehane's novel. When a young girl disappears from her neglectful mother's Boston home, the girl's concerned aunt and uncle hire Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), a private investigator, to augment the police's investigation. Police Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) heads a unit specializing in crimes against children. The detectives on the case, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and partner Nick, suspect a child molester of the kidnapping. But Patrick and his partner Angie (Michelle Monaghan) dig up information on the child's mother, Helene MacCready (Amy Ryan), that leads in a different direction.<br /><br />First-time director and Boston native Ben Affleck emphasizes authenticity and the culture of the working-class Dorchester neighborhood where the action unfolds. Realism and sense of place are where this film excels, including Amy Ryan's terrific portrayal of a common trashy mother too caught up in her own whims to care much about her daughter. My limited experience with Dennis Lehane's work has led me to associate the author with self-righteousness and plots that hinge on far-fetched behavior. \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is no exception. It's preachy. Characters do ridiculous things that I don't really buy. Even so, there are points at which the film becomes a thoughtful meditation on what constitutes right and wrong. It's an entertaining, occasionally insightful thriller.<br /><br />The DVD (Miramax 2008): There are 6 extended or deleted scenes with optional commentary, 2 featurettes, and a feature commentary. \\"Going Home: Behind the Scenes with Ben Affleck\\" (7 min) interviews the director, cast, and producer Sean Bailey about Affleck's directing and the film's themes.

6305736650|5.0|A friend of mine asked me to show him Casablanca about 15 years ago. He seemed to like the film enough until the famous Le Marsailles scene where Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo rallies the Rick's Cafe Americain crowd (and drowns out the Germans) with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem. At that point my friend sneered with disgust that the scene was ludicrous because the French are a bunch of defeatist cowards who would never show such blatant resistance. I tried to explain to him both the historical context and the importance of the scene to the film. He wouldn't have it -- his mind was made up. Disgusted, I switched off the VCR and told him that if he couldn't accept that scene, he might as well not watch the rest of the movie. I haven't seen this friend in over ten years, so I don't know if he ever saw the whole film and/or broadened his Bill O'Reilly perception of the French. I certainly hope so.<br /><br />What's amazing to me is that several other people I've met have questioned the purpose of that scene minus the anti-France diatribe. Some of them see the scene as wartime jingoism. Some of them like the scene but still think it's unnecessary. One girl in my college film class even said that the scene's purpose was solely to &#34;give Paul Henreid more to do.&#34; Mind boggling, to say the least.<br /><br />Up until the Le Marsailles scene, we think we know the characters and their motivations: Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine is a world-wearly cynic who was left embittered by Ilsa Lund's perceived abandonment -- his past as a gun runner to the Republican forces in Spain seems to be a part of him that is dead and buried; Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa Lund is the woman who has callously deserted our hero for Victor Laszlo, though it is clear she is still in love with Rick; Henreid's Victor Laszlo is a cold and distant person who puts everything, including Ilsa, second to his work; Claude Rains' Louis Renault is an amoral bureaucrat whose own pleasures are hisonly motivation.<br /><br />The Les Marsailles scene, however, puts everything into perspective, giving the characters depth as well as foreshadowing what they will do later in the film. The Germans, led by Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser, are singing German military songs when Laszlo commandeers Rick's band and leads them, the patrons and the staff in a chorus of Les Marsailles that drowns out the Germans. Rick doesn't have to order his band to accompany Laszlo in his rendition of Les Marsailles, but he unhesitatingly gives his permission, hinting that his long dormant idealism is still alive and well. It sets up his memorable sacrifice at the end of the film when he gives up the love of his life for the greater good.<br /><br />The audience, likewise, gains a much greater understanding of Ilsa from that scene. Up until that time, the audience is tempted to wonder why she would leave Rick for this activist who puts his cause above everything, including her. She may still love Rick, but when she gazes at Laszlo during the scene, it's clear that not only does she love him as well, she also believes in his cause and admires the passion and fervor he brings to his work and beliefs. Suddenly, the audience realizes why it's not so easy for Ilsa to simply go back to Rick and why the decision is so difficult for her.<br /><br />Laszlo suddenly becomes worthy of competing with Rick for Ilsa's affections. As much as we root for Rick, we also realize during this scene that Laszlo is a true hero who, unlike Rick, has never lost his passion and idealism despite the horrors he has been put through and witnessed. For the first time, the audience begins to wonder if Ilsa should really choose Rick over Laszlo. Later, when Rick initially denies the letters of transit to Ilsa so she and Laszlo can escape, the audience's sympathies have turned 180 degrees from the beginning of the film. We begin to see Rick as somewhat selfish for letting his own desires get in the way of the cause. When he comes to his senses and not only gives Ilsa and Laszlo the letters, but gives up Ilsa as well, we know that it's the right decision.<br /><br />Louis' later conversion to the side of right and virtue isn't as blatantly foreshadowed in the Les Marsailles scene. However, when the Germans are singing their military songs, he does register pronounced disgust with what he is hearing. He half-heartedly fights Major Strasser's later order to shut down Rick's, saying lamely that &#34;everyone is having such a good time.&#34; However, he has made clear with his earlier expression of disgust that he detests the Germans and goes along with their orders out of convenience and not idealogical agreement.<br /><br />Without the Les Marsailles scene, Rick goes from cynic to idealist without any explanation, Ilsa's indecision is inexplicable, Laszlo seems unworthly to take Ilsa from Rick and Louis goes from appeaser to resistor without any warning. The story just wouldn't work without it. The scene switches the focus of the story from lost love to supporting the greater good. It's emotion rivals that of the final airport scene and is absolutely critical to Casablanca. It's so important to the story that I think that the film wouldn't have become the classic it is without it.<br /><br />In 1981, Harry Reasoner produced an excellent segment for 60 Minutes on Casablanca. He pointed out that when Casablanca was released, the Germans did occupy France as well as large parts of Africa, including Casablanca. This wasn't a period piece about events from a long time ago and the emotions portrayed in the Les Marsailles scene were very fresh and very current at the time Casablanca was being filmed. Not only is it absolutely critical to the plot, but it is also a snapshot of the feelings and passions of that time as it was happening. I hope that those who dismiss the scene can go back and, with some deepened perspective, can understand both why the Les Marsailles scene is so important to Casablanca's greatness and what it tells us about what 1942 America's beliefs and feelings were. It might give renewed perspective on our own conflict in Iraq. At the very least, I hope it convinces my friend that the French aren't really so bad after all.
B000TLTUL0|3.0|This film was so-so. It was nothing to do back flips over but it wasn't bad either. Some parts are unintentionally funny though. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter gave great performances in spite of the films mediocrity. If your somebody thats heavily into musicals this is a must see. But If your someone like me, who cant stand the actors busting out in harmony every five minutes, then you will be annoyed at those parts.Overall, this film is worth a movie rental at best but I don't know if I will add this one to my DVD collection or not.
B000WGNLLW|3.0|Never ashamed to admit to being a huge fan of this band, I've gotten most everything they've released since they began. I've followed their many ups and downs, and  their comebacks galore. Astronaut truly excited me, leading me to believe they had indeed grown another set of legs to run on. But this collaboration with Timbaland and his crew leaves me a little cold. It's as underwhelming as Tim's work with Bjork was on her last album. As many songs as he's turned out with other artists that were not only extremely sonically experimental, but also just hook FILLED, this Red Carpet Massacre seems lacking. Excepting the first cut on the CD, \\"the Valley\\", the gorgeous, should-have-been-a-huge-smash-hit \\"Falling Down\\" and the atypical -sounding, mostly acoustic \\"Box Full of Honey\\", nothing here begs for my attention or for repeated listens. RCM isn't HORRIBLE, don't get me wrong. It sounds great ( it certainly should ) but many of the songs sound rushed and incomplete, like a chorus could have been catchier, or the lyrics sharper. I for one would be interested to hear the ( practically complete )  album they scrapped when guitarist Andy Taylor bailed on them. I'm thinking between the two of them they could have come up with a winner. I'm not giving up hope on DD - I never could, I simply like them too much. But RCM won't be on my list of favourites.
B000G03RJA|3.0|The collection is fine, and includes many of the hits missed on previous collections.  Still the collection in my opinion is missing some serious stuff from Miss Branigan's career.  Some the songs on this cd may have been hits in others countries, but they were never hits in the US or Canada.  I for one would enjoy seeing a 2 cd collection that actually includes all of her major hits, plus some of the lesser one. They also seem to always miss includeing tracks from the cd \\"Over my Heart\\".
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A great film about the toughness, fearlessness, and ruthlessness required to overcome a totalitarian government. The character V is a man who has been tortured into a hardened, yet human, character. The portrayal is excellent - think Batman Begins. Great film.
0679746323|1.0|This is not serious history!  This is not serious scholarship!  This screed is intellectually lacking and bankrupt.  This is a waste of effort and money.  Even as one acknowledges that Mao was a monster, there is absolutely no historical objectivity in this book.   It is a tough book to get through since it is such a hatchet job and overly simplistic.  The formula it follows is this:  Mao = Bad, Anything or anyone opposed to Mao = Good.    All historical facts and accounts are tainted and suspect because of the whole tone of the book- nothing is credible.  This is simply a screaming diatribe or catharsis against Mao.  Anyone who expressed a position that differed from the authors' views - from journalists, to historians, to philosophers, economists and academics, heads of state etc.  (past, present and I would assume future) is tagged as \\"naive\\", \\"a lackey\\" or a \\"chowder head liberal\\"!  I do not recommend this book for anything.  It is useless as history, or as a biography.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Yo!  These guys completely knocked it out of the park!  Way to go! Completely Insane!  My fave is track 4--totally BEASTY!    On the other hand, I believe that anyone who has posted negative reviews on \\"Blackbird\\" must be major fans of Submersed' new c.d. \\"Immortal Verses\\"--COME-ON!  I had to search the web to see if they were even the same group because their sound is so different.  Other bands(POD is a great example) made radical changes to their sound, and are now FORGOTTEN.     Altar Bridge deserves major kudos for staying true to the strengths of their first project and building on them.  The best album ever!  I love ALL 13 Tracks!  ROCK ON!
1563898586|2.0|After reading comics such as Girl Genius and Archie comics, I feel like buying this book was a waste of money. The plot was lacking as well as the artistry. I had high hopes for it because of the movie, but I was sorely disappointed.
B000VMBXNA|3.0|This is the first book downloaded onto my new Kindle.  Other reviewers have \\"nutshelled\\" the plot. I enjoyed it; however, think I might have liked it better had it placed more emphasis on literature in general and the current apathy toward it by our culture.  Of course, having the British monarch suddenly become an avid reader has more comedic opportunities....  It's a quick, easy read.  I actually would have given it 3 1/2 stars.
B000003BF1|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />There are a lot of terrific rock and roll albums; this ranks among the best.  There is great poignancy with this work.  For one thing, some of the songs are poignant--\\"Love in Vain,\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" For another, we see Brian Jones on only two cuts, and playing a minor role (autoharp on \\"You Got the Silver\\" and percussion on \\"Midnight Rambler\\"), with Mick Taylor (his successor) playing guitar (\\"Live with Me\\").<br /><br />As a salad dressing apothegm has it, though: \\"'Tis the taste that tells the tale.\\" And what a work!<br /><br />It starts off with a great little rocker, \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"  There is a foreboding note at the outset (ironic given that this song, if memory serves, was being played when the Hell's Angels began their havoc at Altamont).  Nice choral singing in the background.  Key lines:<br /><br />\\"A storm is threatening'<br />. . . .<br />If I don't get some shelter<br />I'm gonna fade away.\\"<br /><br />The rhythm section (Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman) plays well, and Keith Richards spews forth chunky guitar notes.  Mick Jagger does a nice job on harmonica.<br /><br />\\"Love in Vain\\": I risk the wrath of blues fans. . . .  I like this version better than either of the multiple ones on Robert Johnson's 2 CD work. Keith's spare guitar work and Mick's vocals simply work extremely well.  The Stones have done an estimable job over time covering blues classics--and even recording some of their own original blues-y works.  Here, they show that they can do a credible job as compared with the originals.<br /><br />\\"Country Honk\\": Interesting in its country sound, but listen to \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" for the real deal.  This is a nice experiment, but. . . .<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler\\": The album version is terrific, but after you listen to the live version on \\"Get Your Ya-Yas Out,\\" this recedes into the background.  And that's a compliment to the live version, since this is a great, haunting, disturbing rock and roll song.  A song about Albert DiSalvo can only be described as \\"creepy.\\"  Still, the recorded version works well and is compelling rock theater. Mick's harmonica work is quite well done here. The presto close out is fabulous.<br /><br />\\"You Can't always Get What You Want\\": Some of the most poignant lines in rock and roll:<br /><br />\\"You can't always get what you want,<br />But if you try, sometime you just might find<br />You get what you need.\\"<br /><br />This song features the London Bach Choir in support! This is an interesting and intelligent (and poignant) song. Noteworthy: Al Kooper joins the Stones with some nice turns on French horn (kind of weird for rock and roll!), piano, and organ.<br /><br />Simply, one of the classic rock and roll albums. . . .ed version works well and is compelling rock theater.

0345494997|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the first paragraph. The quality of the writing, the style and the attention to fact and detail. Excellent first novel. I particularly liked the way the author ended her story and went right into presenting the basis for her information, etc. That lent more credibility to the story
B0001BKAEE|5.0|I love this movie and bought the full screen edition and like it much better than the letterbox format.
0805079831|5.0|The Shock Doctrine details how we were addicted to the false idea of the \\"Free Market\\" and how this was used to bludgeon countries around the world into submission to us. It explains how military power and ruthless authoritarian governments were imposed by us as an essential part of our strategy. Naomi Klein has collected all the facts in a remarkable job of research to make a  strong case that many admired heros of the past 30+ years are seriously implicated as villains. Of course, Iraq is the latest in a long string of failed foreign policy debacles.  Now Klein's conclusions lead to the case made by Robert Kuttner in his latest book, The Squandering of America, that we are unable to deal with the managed capitalism of  China (and others) because our hands are tied by our religious attachment to the irrationality of the free market.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|I must confess, I bought this item on a whim. Having just bought into Blu Ray and shopping for items to play on my new toy. I was already familiar with Shakira from her chart hits, but that was about it. This concert is quite the experience to say the least.    Both picture and audio quality are superb in full blown 1080/24p with optional stereo/surround audio options. The concert is a high energy affair with Shakira in fine voice, bending her body in ways I didn't know were possible.     Content-wise all her chart hits are there plus plenty more in Spanish and English. Right from the off, she has the audience eating from her hand (and me)right to the end. When you consider the bonus material on this disc, plus the free CD, for the price it's an outright gem.    Whether you are an ardent Shakira fan or a casual one, this disc will not let you down. I'm glad I took the chance and discovered Shakira! Shakira.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I'm watching the standard DVDs on an upconverting DVD player, and it looks fantastic.  I bought the standard DVDs because I wanted the extra diaries on the filming process.  They add greatly to the experience.  Absolutely superb.  Watch it with your kids.  Highest possible recommendation.
B000VRXO6O|4.0|There are some great songs on these cds, many of which I had never heard before.  It sounds like it was made from vinyl though, there are pops and cracks, which sort of distract, now that I am not used to hearing those anymore.  It's definately worth buying.
B000FA57US|4.0|I was in the mood for some Slasher movies and this along with part 4 made a nice double feature.  The sound and picture quality on the Divimax disc was good.  There were some minor extras on the disc that I found entertaining well.<br /><br />While the movie wasn't as good as part 4 was, it still managed to entertain and keep us in suspense.

B0012QE4OO|3.0|David is a normal enough high school boy, trying to impress his girl despite the usual kinds of bullies. Then, after a teenish bit of bad judgement, he falls through the surface of a frozen river. Once under the ice, the river's current drags him away from the opening, and from light and air. When his lungs are about to burst ... he and a fair bit of river water suddenly materialize in a familiar library.<br /><br />David is a \\"Jumper,\\" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control. In teen-off-the-leash style, he makes free with bank vaults and any other interior that holds something he wants, which is pretty much everything. I said that he's \\"a\\" jumper - not the only one. There are others, and there is a secretive cabal dedicated to ridding the world of jumpers.<br /><br />It turns pretty predictable after that. The effects make this flick, especially the fights and chases between two Jumpers. There are worse ways you could kill a few hours on a boring weekend - it really is fair entertainment, with some (but not much) less-than-graphic violence and people who keep their clothes on. I just hope that Samuel L. Jackson isn't betting his career on woofers like this.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
6305428425|3.0|I picked up this movie just to see it, if that makes any sense.  It was a nice, lite, airy comedy about a real horror story we have all dealt with : high school.  Two dizzy blondes who had been friends since those days and are still together have returned to their high school for the ten year reunion.  They really haven't amounted to much, but try to reinvent themselves as success stories to impress their former classmates.      This was a clever idea, but the idea did not stretch out enough to make a quality movie out of it.  I have been to my ten year reunion, and I must say that you feel sort of like a loser.  You can use it as a motivation to make things better for you, but we all lack in some way.  What is so funny is that, at least at my reunions, the popular kids, whose high school experience must have been so wonderful because they made everyone else so miserable, didn't show up.  People go right back to the same cliques they were in, even if they haven't seen or spoken to each other in years.  Maybe you don't have the loving spouse, fame, fortune, steller career or whatever else is so important, but neither do others.  The Mean Girls are losers.  Romy and Michelle of course rise to prominence after the reunion, and tell the Mean Girls off.    And know what?  You didn't need their approval then and you don't need it now.  So when the invite comes, pitch it out and move on.

0440418569|1.0|While I enjoyed The Golden Compass well enough to continue on to The Subtle Knife, and found that interesting enough to then begin The Amber Spyglass, I'm very glad I checked them all out of the library and didn't waste money buying them.  Pullman has some interesting creations - particularly the daemons, but these books lack the humor of Rowling's Harry Potter series or the wonder of Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Even The Golden Compass isn't a book that I'd ever bother to read again and I liked it more than Knife and much, much more than Spyglass.  I wasted a week of evenings slogging through The Amber Spyglass which was in dire need of a good editor (or an editor gutsy enough to send it back to Pullman and tell him to do a massive revision).  I continued chapter after tedious chapter in the hopes that the various plots would somehow be melded into a satisfying conclusion.  My advice is to treat the series as incomplete and don't bother reading the last book.<br /><br />How these depressing and violent books could be classified as children's books is beyond me, and how a book that is as pretentious and disjointed The Amber Spyglass won awards mystifies me.
0805211063|4.0|As a philosophical exercise this novel succeeds, as entertainment it's lacking.  What I mean is that Kafka's frustration with bureaucracy comes through clearly in this work.  It's his nightmare. K, the protagonist has been contracted to do work at the castle, but he cannot get there - no roads lead to the castle, no one can introduce him or take him there, and despite finding a place in the village his ultimate goal is continually thwarted.<br /><br />I did appreciate how Kafka demonstrates the villagers loyalty to the officials of the castle, even when they didn't understand what the officials did, or why, or how.  It's surely a commentary on questioning authority.<br /><br />But the novel was frustrating and that, I believe is Kafka's intention - to evoke a strong emotional discontentment through a frustrated main character.  That's the success of the novel - and it did make me think about the condition of life, being guided like a mule after the carrot on a stick.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the novel, but I learned from it and maybe that's the highest compliment of all.<br /><br />- CV Rick, February 2008
B000002JEV|5.0|My wife got this for me for Valentines. Not knowing anything about this collection I thought it was just going to be a rehash of songs I already had. From the minute I popped it in though I realized that the versions presented here (in fact duplicate but unique versions of some songs) really highlight what a great band Led Zeppelin was, as their songs could morph at any moment into something totally unexpected, yet still pound with the energy that they are known for. I'm going to enjoy listening to this one as it brings a new freshness to these songs, even though they were recorded almost 30 years ago.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|[[ASIN:B000P6YNSE Lost - The Complete Third Season]]   Excellent selective series, I have remained loyal to LOST for 3 seasons now & this Season 3  was one of the best I have seen.

0440238609|1.0|Read The Golden Compass and if you really like it, then read The Subtle Knife.  But don't bother with The Amber Spyglass.  It does not supply a satisfying conclusion to the series and doesn't hold together as a story, but hops from one character and universe to another with no apparent point to several of the plot lines.
B00009N83U|2.0|The first Clint Eastwood film not to be given a cinema release and go straight-to-video in most overseas territories is a lightweight but amiable enough star vehicle that casts him as a skip tracer tracking down Bernadette Peters, who has skipped bail and headed for Reno in her recidivist husband's pink Cadillac unaware that the boot contains $250,000 of his neo-Nazi friends' money. The presence of the star's green t-shirt and blue jeans outfit from Every Which Way But Loose clearly signposts it as one of his periodic redneck comedies, but unlike the superior Honkytonk Man and Bronco Billy, there's no depth of feeling here. It's all on the surface and ambles along predictably, but doesn't really have an ending, with action scenes that are decidedly tame and lame and a main villain who's decidely unthreatening (for all their posturing, the bad guys don't really do much more than waste their time on target practice).     A more restrained Peters than we're used to gives better than she gets from the script, but Clint is clearly having a whale of a time with a part that enables him to show a lot more range and extrovert good-humoured charm than much of the rest of his career put together. That said, some of his disguises are a bit hard to take - especially when he dons shades, spats, gold lame suit and Charlie Parker jive - although he does make a worryingly convincing inbred Southern gumby at one point. With the Malpaso stock company represented by Geoffrey Lewis (as a spaced-out hippy that really should have been played by Dennis Hopper), Bill McKinney and Mara Corday and with bit parts from Jim Carrey as a casino entertainer and James Cromwell as a none-too-bright desk clerk, this is clearly one for the money rather than one from the heart. If the script could have done with a tune up and the film benefited from tighter direction and a little pruning, this still just about passes as pleasant enough Saturday night fare for all that, though chances are the only thingabout it you'll remember an hour later is the end title song.
1427200882|5.0|Hell, even New York Magazine tagged this book as A Brilliant Inditement of Chicago School Economics.<br /><br />Some very smart people that know a thing or two about economics highly recommended this book to me. So, I got it and well--<br /><br />To anybody out there that is not sure if they want to purchase this book --<br /><br />After you've read this book you will not look at the world the same way again. Yea,  it's one of THOSE books. It will indeed affect the way you understand things because it will open your eyes and make you see what you have not before. I don't mean to sound melodramatic, it is just a fact. We live in a radically troubled and unjust world and it is time we all wake up to the reality of how our economic and political systems are destroying people and the planet.<br /><br />If your skeptical or if you consider yourself a conservative, a Right-winger, a Republican, whatever, -- I would still recommend the book to you if you have an interest in economics. It's an interesting read and very well written.
1594489505|1.0|A dreary piece of trash, but my book club choice for last month.  What really amazes me is the critical acclaim this boring work received!!

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Don't deprive yourself of a magical film adventure based on a few bad reviews.  I admit, I wasn't sold for perhaps the first 20-30 minutes.  But then - BAM - I was sucked in.  The characters were living the music and each setting was perfection.  I've never owned a movie in my life.  This is the first.  The choreography for the Induction scene was the single most impressive I've ever seen.  The casting was perfect.  I would love to hear what Paul and Ringo have to say.  This movie will sweep the Oscars!
B0000844M8|4.0|Along with Lassie Come Home, Born Free is probably the gold standard of animal movies in terms, and there's a lot to like in this story of Joy Adamson and her gamekeeper husband trying to return the domesticated lioness Elsa to the wild: the lion cubs are cute, the Scope wildlife photography still impressive and John Barry's score especially beautiful (the famous Matt Munro song was added to the end titles after the film was already on release. Where it shows its age is when the humans take centre-stage. At times Virginia McKenna can be a bit too head girl of the hockey school as Joy Adamson for a modern audience - while the Adamsons' real-life relationship was so tempestuous they spent much of their lives apart (Travers recalled that during filming whenever George was in the doghouse, Joy would treat him with equal condescension), their movie incarnations are so determinedly nice they make characters from Disney films of the 60s look like axe murderers. That said, McKenna and Travers are one of the few real-life married couples who make a convincing couple onscreen, bringing a comfortable familiarity to their scenes that smoothes over some of the more twee dialogue.     Its surprise success after a slow start led to director James Hill reluctantly being typecast on many of the slew of similar animal films that followed in its wake while his two stars started the Born Free foundation to release zoo animals into the wild. It also led to a very unfortunate sequel, Living Free, though none of the key players apart from Carl Foreman would return.     Not much in the way of extras - only trailers - but a good widescreen transfer.
067960085X|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" this is a book you should read.  If you have not, but have enjoyed other stories by Truman I believe this gives a wonderful insight as to who he is.

B0012NVGHU|5.0|While on a trans Atlantic flight returning from Ireland I came across this movie.

B00006HAZG|4.0|This is a winner. The first part especially is superb, due in large part to Daniel Radcliffe as the young David. It would be difficult to imagine a better performance; he dominated every scene that he was in. The second part with a different David is something of a letdown. It is too full of events for any to be fully developed but that is probably due to trying to include most of the novel in too abbreviated a fashion. Buy it mainly for the acting debut of Daniel Radcliffe in the first part. He was 9 years old when he did this and he has never done anything better, perhaps nothing quite as good, since.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an excellent series.  The only thing wrong is there's not enough of it.  But rather than have more episodes the network decided to kill it off.  The wild West comes to Space.  Take a very interesting and complex group of people, put them on a space ship on the \\"fringes of space\\", throw in a flair for mystery and adventure, and you have an excellent and well written space opera.  Some episodes are much stronger than others, but it's space opera at its best.  Sit down, have some brew and pop corn, and enter into a  different adventure each episode.

He is so thrilled with the DVD and all the info that it gives, he is watching it all most every night.  Thank you for making these old classics so easily available.
B000E1MTXQ|4.0|Great movie, and in stunning full HD, \\"Supremacy\\" picks up where \\"Identity\\" leaves off.<br /><br />The only quirk I have with this movie is some of the chosen direction in fight sequences, at times, nausiating. I suppose it gives the movie a faster pace, look and feel, but also isn't too distracting.<br /><br />The picture and sound make up for any shortcomings. Blacks in night scenes are jet black, no film grain is evident. Flesh tones accurate and true to life.<br /><br />This is a great moderm film trilogy for any action genre fan. Complex story lines keep you thinking and entertained.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and a must see before viewing \\"Ultimatum\\", the last in trilogy.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|1996's \\"Emma\\" is a dramatization of one of Jane Austen's last novels, featured young Gwyneth Paltrow in the leading role.  \\"Emma\\" as directed by Douglas McGrath is pure romantic comedy.<br /><br />Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow)is the youngest daughter of an aging aristocrat (Denys Hawthorne) and a benign but inept matchmaker for her friends.  Her particular target is her friend Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), whom she talks out of accepting the offer of an honest farmer in favor of pursuing the more sophisticated young cleryman Mr. Elher (Alan Cummings).  This scheme falls to pieces when it becomes embarassingly clear that Mr. Elher is more interested in Emma.  Emma continues to search for an eligible young man for Harriet, becoming distracted along the way by her feelings for the roguish Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor), who has caught the eye of several local ladies.<br /><br />Emma's inept matchmaking culminates in her thoughtless humiliation of the chatty but harmless spinster Miss Bates at a picnic.  She is very properly upbraided for bad form by her very patient good friend Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam in a movie-stealing performance).  Emma realizes almost too late that her own interest may lie with Mr. Knightley. Their walk in the woods may be the most priceless scene in the movie, as Mr. Knightley tries to set the scene for a proposal of marriage while Emma tries to head off what she fears will be an end to their friendship.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is good fun but leaves something to be desired as an Austen adaptation.  The leading character has been bleached of her imperfections; she is charming and likeable throughout the movie with the single exception of the incident at the picnic.  She pays no particular price for her interference in other people's lives; the painful personal growth we expect in a Jane Austen character that will lead to the right mate has been almost airbrushed out of the story.  That said, \\"Emma\\" is still worthwhile entertainment, highly recommended to those looking for a frothy romantic comedy.for a frothy romantic comedy.

But recycled Michael at 29.95 is nothin' but a bad deal.<br />The new mixes are good, but not great....the digitial source tape sounds the same.<br /><br />Save your money and buy a used copy of the original remastered disc and rock with him.....all night<br /><br />This  is one messed up dude - is musically, and facially kaput.
B00009P1O2|5.0|The best live concert ever recorded in 1986. Sound, video, and crowd energy are perfect. If you are a Queen fan, this is a must have DVD. This is the way live concerts should be!
B000VLE3GA|3.0|Led Zeppelin were one of the mightiest forces in rock music, with a stomp that resounds even today, primarily because they did something no band had ever done or has been able to do since, make rock and roll larger than life to the point of being mythic! Even their down-and-dirty first album, which was mainly confined to blues and folk based rock, managed to raise a normally down-to-earth genre to the level of the grotesque, and I mean that as a high compliment. LZ II was one of the most astonishing breakthrough albums ever, a major advance, and it was released in the same year as its predecessor! A decade's worth of great music followed, which holds up even today..is it any wonder that Led Zeppelin continue to be biggest band in the world?    The problem is, since the death of drummer John Bonham almost thirty years ago, Zeppelin has created no new music. Still, that hasn't stopped the folks in marketing from continuing to release the old material over and over again while packaging it as though it were something brand new. Hence Mothership, the latest effort at cashing in. The come-on this time is that the music was allegedly remastered to absolute perfection, yet it sounds like the same old Zep to my undiscriminating ears, but then I listened to a library copy on my car stereo and perhaps did not get the full effect. But even if the songs do sound perfect, overproducing Led Zeppelin, as far as I'm concerned, is like colorizing old black and white movies or adding modern special effects to the original Star Trek. What's the point? One of the glories of Trek was its ability to overcome its technical limitations and still tell brilliant stories. Likewise, sound quality that maintains a degree of muddiness isn't such a bad thing when it comes to a band like Zeppelin, it just makes their blues rock epics sound even edgier, and heavier. Who wants a cleaned up version of Led Zeppelin?    The song selection here could have been better as well. This is more of a greatesthits package than a best of, in other words the choice of tracks is pretty uninspired. Not that the songs are weak...yeah, right. This is Led Zeppelin we're talking about. Still, they could have been better, they certainly could have been more adventurous. Granted, any fan's best of Led Zeppelin list is going to be subjective, and fans can argue until they're blue in the face over which songs are the strongest. But including four tracks from the first album, which happens to be one of my least favorite Zeppelin releases, and only three from the whopping  double album Physical Graffiti, arguably the greatest hard rock album ever, is a travesty as far as I'm concerned.  Where are The Wanton Song, Ten Years Gone or In the Light? Frankly the whole list is predictable to the point of being boring, inasmuch as a band like Led Zeppelin can ever be boring. Personally, I would have preferred How Many More Times to Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, The Lemon Song or What Is and What Should Never Be to Whole Lotta Love, That's the Way or Gallows Pole over Immigrant Song, Goin' to California over Black Dog or Stairway to Heaven(sacrilege, I know) Dancing Days or The Rain Song over D'yermaker, I'm Gonna Crawl over In the Evening, I could go on and on. And Heartbreaker without the severely underrated Livin' Lovin' Maid sounds, I hate to say this, incomplete. On the whole, this set is not a good overview of the band at its most creative or diverse(although we do get No Quarter and Kashmir). So I wouldn't recommend it to Zeppelin neophytes, if there are any.      The target audience for this, I'm assuming, is Zeppelin fans who want to have everything state-of-the-art, and who can afford to throw away money on songs they already own. Those people are going to buy this no matter how harsh of a review it gets. But everybody else can steer clear.
B0002M1DDY|5.0|Great album. Winter's best no question. But Amazon has this listed as 2 discs 1999 \\"Mobile Fidelity\\" when Mobile's release was only one disc and Amazon.co.uk has it listed as \\"Columbia\\" 2 discs 2004, which makes alot more sense.     In other words a EU release of the US legacy 2004 pressing hopefully minus those ugly 1 inch diameter FBI warning medallions ruining the artwork on the rear cover and prominantly printed on both CDs. Who pays this money to be warned about piracy every time you put the CD in when you paid for it.     Simply put if this release is the EU version of the 2 disc without the ridiculous FBI warnings I would go personally for this one over the US pressingBut amazon seems to have their info all mixed up. So....
B001041JKU|1.0|The sound is improved a wee-little-teeny-tiny bit, and the remixes aren't too exciting.<br /><br />Save your money, and buy a used copy of the original or the 2001 remaster.  Better yet, listen to it on vinyl with Q's mix, the bass will ROCK YOUR HOUSE!<br /><br />Recycled Michael from 25 years ago just only goes to show you how musically and facially kaput this middle aged boy wonder is.  The music is classic and hold up, but it really is impossible to listen to without thinking about what a train wreck Michael Jackson has become. Pray for him. I'd love nothing more than for him to release a hugemongous comeback album.<br /><br />But that's not too likely.
B000K15VSA|5.0|For die-hard fans of Blade Runner this is as good as it gets. Well worth the wait.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a soft, lullaby type album with Celine's amazing voice- perfect for bedtime!! I heard this at my cousin's house and went home to buy it that same day for my little one- we play it every night as she falls asleep.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Nearly 40 years since its release, Le Mans remains the best racing film ever made, because the focus is on the cars and course of the greatest endurance event in motor sports.<br /><br />The major parts of the film were filmed during the June 1970 race, with cutting-edge technology used to provide the viewer a driver's view of the action.<br /><br />A Porsche 908/2 - which actor Steve McQueen had co-driven to a second place finish in the 12 Hours of Sebring - was entered in Le Mans by Solar Productions and equipped with movie cameras. The camera car was driven Herbert Linge and Jonathan Williams.<br /><br />With a believable, though minor, sub-plot on the tension between a wife and her husband concerning the risks & rewards from the sport, director Lee H. Katzin delivers a classic by allowing the pace of the race dictate the action.
630587493X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film when it first came to theaters a long time ago. Robin Williams almost always provides us with fun and laughter, but this story touches on serious philisophical and ethical questions.  It seems to me that I saw this movie ages ago; however, it been only 9 years since its release.  While I enjoyed Bicentennial Man, I never realized that the story was published in hardcover in 1976 as I had always thought that the book, The Positronic Man, had been the model for \\"Data\\" in the Star Trek Next Generation series. All of these are wonderful stories, but I do believe that if you haven't read The Positronic Man by Asimov and Silverberg that you would enjoy it.  It definitely changed many of my views on life, death, and the phrase \\"sentient being\\".  It is more adult book, but suitable for teenagers on up. As I will soon be 70, maybe I ought to read that book again!
B00117P0HE|5.0|this movie is scary like a horror movie should be. There were several times where i jumped. the scary moments were integrated exceptionally well. I would recommend this movie for anyone looking for a scare and to have a fun time doing it. Milla Jovovich was critical to this film's success and Jovovich delivers. If you saw any of the other Resident Evil films and enjoyed their entertainment value, this movie should not be missed.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|If you're taking a completely daft idea -- like creating an old-fashioned Busby Berkeley musical out of Beatles songs -- and doing it in the daftest possible way -- attempting to twist those unrelated lyrics into the story of the `60s -- you had better be darn sure you're not further shooting yourself in the foot by being cliched, obvious and predictable doing it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, director Julie Taymor does exactly that.  Everything in this movie is on a seventh grade level, portraying the fevered earnestness of the time as one big junior high school play.  There are moments of inspired choreography (such as crowd scenes where everybody suddenly pirouettes) but by and large the staging (fake Vietnam, fake race riots, fake war protests, fake modern art, fake hippies dancing in too-clean streets, fake soldiers singing in too-clean jungles) comes off as ashes in your mouth.<br /><br />In the film's defense the singing is all painfully good, the actors are all painfully beautiful, and the dancing, sets and costumes are all expensively non-digital.  I can't imagine what it cost to license all those Beatles songs....  But the end result of All This Money and Not Much Insight is two hours of slobbery pastiche which rings neither authentic nor endearing.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD arrived in great shape as offered by the seller!  The soundtrack is very entertaining!
B000ASDFJU|1.0|as some reviews mentioned, the price is not cheap    i heard a lot about how wonderful this show is/was and decided to get the whole package - expecting to enjoy it    first, the delivery was delayed due to whatever reason, but i am appreciative to receive it in the end    when i played the first DVD from season 1 ep 1-3 was great, i enjoyed the show    however from season 1 ep4-6 onwards, DVD has problems, making the viewing unpleasant    i have not played all the DVDs but expect more DVD to be faulty    for close to $200, HBO is providing very bad quality
B000UJ48U4|4.0|Although not a huge fan of Cruise, but fond of Kidman, I was buying this for the Kubrick factor.  Good choice, both actors are perfect in their roles...the chemisty is there.  Very rich and loamy film, made my skin crawl at the depiction of the underworld that Cruise discovers.  Great exploration of the complex nature of connection vs otherness in a marriage.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|\\"This is England\\" is strong and unsettling in the way powerful and violent literature can often be.  The story is a simple one:  A youngster, Shaun Fields (in a flawless performance by newcomer, Tomo Turgoose), lives with his mother in England after losing his father in the Falklands during the early 1980's.  Bullied, ridiculed, or ignored by his classmates, he is befriended by a gang of skinheads, led by the likeable Woody, (Joe Gilgun).<br /><br />Shaun's role gradually changes from mascot to convert as he begins participating in increasingly horrifying acts of violence until the movie's brutal climax.<br /><br />Like literary classics such as \\"Native Son\\" or \\"A Lesson Before Dying,\\" \\"This is England\\" is as much about youthful initiation and class disenfranchisement as it is about racism.  Due to this movie's violent realism, it can be difficult to watch at times, but it captures a period in history, as well as the universality of needing to belong, in a remarkable and unforgettable way.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|You'll love this if you enjoy Méhdi, Enya or other soothing music artists. It is the very essence of good music. So tranquil, yet so spirited, this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection, I just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again. I am amazed! It reminds me somewhat of Secret Garden's older works, but still very unique. This is music to the soul. Absolutely relaxing, as well.    Also Recommeded: Méhdi ~ Paradise..A True Gem... Full Samples at Soothing Music Dot Com...Just go Listen ![[ASIN:B000PGQEIG Instrumental Paradise Volume 8]]
B0012QE4OO|2.0|All the actors here just go through the motions, especially the no talent hack by the name of Hayden Christensen. Rachel Bilson is oh so cute, but her acting could use some work as well. We all know Sam Jackson doesn't turn down a paycheck and he just cashed in here. The special effects were neat and the story did have potential, but it really was just a complete mess. I don't know if I could have taken more than 85 minutes of Jumper. The tagline \\"anywhere is possible\\" is fitting for a movie that I wish applied to me while watching it. Maybe anywhere else is possible would make more sense than sitting through this film again.
6304696515|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie.   Great acting by the leading actors, but I especially enjoyed Malkovich's.  I especially enjoyed the scenes where he enters a room like a predator & walks around his victims as of they were prey.  Overall a spectacular & engrossing movie.
B00005JL96|3.0|We got this movie for my son for Christmas. He's 3 years-old and absolutely loves it. And it is a very cute flick. However, there are some questionable items in the movie that I think may have Walt Disney rolling in his grave. For instance, at one point a character calls another a \\"stupid head.\\" While that may not seem like a big deal by today's standards, it doesn't seem to have a place in a Disney movie.
B0010ZR160|3.0|We liked this movie enough to buy it after seeing it at the theater.  Loved the ending.  Over all pretty typical but still okay.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second album was my \\"gateway Zeppelin\\" experience.  That is what I like most about this studio/live recording.    While I have always loved the songs and sounds of II, the production values were HORRIBLE!  It has a muddy, bottom heavy sound that never did the songs justice.  On this BBC live in the studio double disc, the best of II are there with a dynamic, bright and inspired (LIVE) sound.    The original Led Zeppelin II can only be enjoyed at 1 or 2 o clock on the volume.  This BBC studio set sounds great at 10 or 11 o clock!    Stop reading these reviews and BUY THIS DOUBLE CD!
B000YPUFAG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000YPUFAG Resident Evil: Extinction [UMD for PSP]]]       As an addition to the Resident Evil universe, Extinction doesn't add up very well. It doesn t explain how the virus does the things it does, it doesn t tie up the ends we would like tied up, and for the most part its just a Milla Jovovich-fest.         That being said, it is an entertaining action film. While not out right terrifying, it will make you jump slightly in certain moments. It does have people you want to see survive, and those you can t wait for their end to come. For a simple action film who s only real purpose was to allow another one to be made--it is enjoyable and it did leave the opening for a Resident Evil 4.          From a technical point of view, it is an excellent transfer to UMD. There is very little ghosting in the dark scenes, the audio syncing is flawless, and the action scenes are crisp and clean. Even using the PSP-Slim s video output feature is done well. The UMD version looks dvd quality on a 32 inch HDTV.          Do I recommend this film to a Resident Evil fan, one who s been playing the games since the beginning? No, I m sorry to say I can t. The continuity and characters fail to fit into the universe they were forced into. If you insist on seeing this as a continuation of the games, you will be extremely disappointed.         Do I recommend this film to an action junky who wants something to watch on their psp on a long trip? Definitely. Its an easy film to just enjoy watching, as long as your willing to forget its  Resident Evil .
B000P12LWY|5.0|Rarely does a series capture the viewer as this riveting interpretation available through Showtime and now, thanks to Amazon. We were rather interested in finding out more about the story of Anne Boleyn and Sir Thomas More.    We have placed a request on the book that captures Sir Thomas More's life: \\"A man for all Seasons\\" but decided to see the series first as a prelude to a time that defined the religious inclination of a monarchy and the departure from Rome.    The series is excellent, with the key ingredients to keep the audience engaged: intrigue, murder, duels... and romance... or should we say, lots of sex scenes. After reading other reviews, I realize that the series may not have followed the letter of the historical facts, so I shall endeavor to read more about the period to know how far The Tudors take us from reality.    We must admit that the casting is awesome. Cardinal Wolsey, played by Sam Neill opens a view to the dangers of politics and the backstabbing that takes place at court, going from being the confidant of Henry the VIII to gaining the disfavor of the King and therefore, losing stature and ultimately, his life.    The filming is beautiful and the special features provide a rare view behind the scenes that explains much of what happens. It is with great anticipation that we wait for the release of the next season and we highly recommend watching The Tudors. English history provides the examples necessary to understand human nature.
1847371167|5.0|Hosseini's dramatic story of Afghanistan over the last three decades is a masterful work of fiction.  This recording does it full justice and brings the sounds...almosts the feel and smell...of Kabul to life.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am a radio personality and I'm pretty rough on my headphones.  Over the years I've used AKG's, Sennheisers, and Sony.  By far the most durable has always been Sony, and I absolutely LOVE this pair.  Very comfortable (which is important when you wear them for 5 hrs per day) and the sound is spectacular.  I was surprised at the fancy packaging with this pair - it looks as if the headphones are lying on satin sheets which made me giggle.  In fact, I still keep them in the box instead of the case that came with because it looks so cool (and is more protective).<br /><br />...okay, I'm editing this review on June 29, 2009...because my headphones no longer work correctly.  There was an intermittent short for a few weeks, now the short seems to be permanent.  I'm actually ordering another pair hoping I will treat them more gently, because I really do love the sound and comfort.  Just beware, they can't take a lot of abuse.
0143038419|5.0|Adventurous, honest, heart-warming, & totally relatable! An eye-opening experience in exploring the offerings of three other countries while taking the time to discover & listen to ones own heart. This book makes you want to get up & get out of your comfort zone to explore some new territories while being strong enough to realize who you are.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this movie and I'm really glad Amazon had it. The price was great too since no one else had it or they wanted to charge over twenty dollars!  Thanks Amazon.

B00005MCX2|5.0|35 years ago someone invited me back to their house, gave me a few beers and a funny fag, sat me down and put on Space Ritual. It was an epiphany. I love Zeppelin, Yes, Purple, Genesis, Santana, Springsteen to name but some, but no band has ever produced a live album as good as Space Ritual. It completely blew me away. Hawkwind captured lightening in a bottle with this album and although they never matched it in terms of creativity or intensity, it will live on as long there are people who like to let their hair down and just let go. It has an energy and a hypnotic quality that is unique - melodic, intriguing and totally captivating. It is the ultimate head-banging record and while it can be enjoyed sober, to really appreciate what a work of art it is you really need to have a bit of a buzz on. Your significant other may wonder what all the fuss is about but if you like to rock and you like to roll and like to head-bang like there's no tomorrow, then crack a tube (or three), pull up a chair and set the controls for the heart of the sun; Hawkwind will give you all the in-flight entertainment you will ever need. A classic album that ranks up there with the very best live albums.
B00102FELM|5.0|I am completely speechless after watching this fantasitc dvd. I was blown away by this performance(especially Uli Roth's performance , which I thought stole the show, I won't ever bag on his singing ever again.) And it is always great to see Michael Schenker play with them as well. It is a shame that four tracks were omitted from the show (one being \\"In Search of the Peace of Mind, from my favorite Scorps album \\"Lonesome Crow\\"), but this dvd is definitly a keeper. This show will blow you off your feet.  And it's great to see them cover songs from  RCA days.
B000XPU5NY|2.0|Now, if you love Seconds Out or Three Sides Live, don't bother with this Live Over Europe.  Yeah, the song list is pretty impressive, but the mixes are really nothing but Collins' yowling over everything and Banks' 1984 Casio Keyboard sounds blaring out of his Korgs and Yahama's.  Rutherford, Sturmer and Thompson are BURIED big time here except for Thompson on \\"Conversation Between 2 Stools\\", which is really the usual Collins/Thompson \\"Drum Duet\\".  Everything else is bland considering what songs were chosen to be on Live Over Europe.  I'm not saying Banks should break out the old Moogs and Peter Gabriel should take the stage by surprise and turn into Rael or Magog, but I'm relatively hard pressed to believe that this tour was more about the music than the dollars.  Tony Banks is the absolute best, but what he was doing on this tour, I'll never know.  I guess the greats sometimes have their slumps.  Best songs: Firth/Like/Stagnation.  Total weak dumpers: Ripples and Mama.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|It's too bad it took them this long to re release these classics with unreleased tracks, but better late than never. Finally the hard to find single of \\"Give her the Gun\\", and \\"sweet little thing\\"  (the first single featuring Michael Schenker, and first release on Chrysalis) along with the song \\"Sixteen\\" ( a remake of their 1972 single \\"Galactic Love\\"). also including in this set are the demos of Oh My and Sixteen (featuring Bernie Mardsden on guitar) and a BBC recording of Doctor, Doctor (previously released on UFO BBC live , released in 2000, and now out of print. If you can a copy at a reasonable price do get it.) I was also impressed with rare photos which included a band shoot with Bernie , and some photos sessions as a five piece , with both Michael and his later replacment in the years to come Paul Chapman. This release (as well as the reissue of \\"Force It\\" and \\"No Heavy Petting\\") is a must buy For hardcore UFO fans, and for newcomers looking for something new to discover.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|If you have never really listened to Dream Theater this is the dvd to get! Excellent is all I can say, alot of bands have played their music with symphony orchestras but I must say this is a truly awesome experience soo well composed to fit in all the instruments beautiful blending a real treat!
B000TNF7NS|4.0|Although the Remastering is great , along with unreleased 1973 track \\"A Million Miles \\" is a good track , I will only give it four stars , due to hearing too much live material ( although great recordings ) added as bonus tracks. However like the other two reissues , it is well worth collecting and owning.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Already being a fan of the vocalist Ivan Moody's past projects Motograter, Black Blood Orchestra, and Ghost Machine I was very excited to hear this new  album. I had already heard some of it because I saw them play their first live show in Los Angeles in 2006. After that I was already hooked. This album is what the current metal community needed. It brought a wake up call to all those who say that the new era of metal has been nothing good. Well it's time to put up or shut up because you've got Five Finger Death Punch coming for you!
B000006SGT|3.0|I don't have this CD. But, in looking at the track list, I feel that many hit songs are missing.  When I was growing up in California, the following songs were hits for the Animals:  \\"Don't Bring Me down\\", \\"See See Rider\\" (a minor hit), \\"Help Me Girl\\", \\"San Franciscan Nights\\", \\"Monterey\\", \\"Sky Pilot\\", \\"When I Was Young\\"  (I smoked my first cigarette at 10.  And for girls I had a bad yen).  Where are these songs on this CD?<br />If you want to hear the songs I am referring to, plus more, get the Animals CD called \\"Retrospective\\". If you are a hard core Animals fan, then perhaps you will enjoy this Complete ? CD.
B000002IOJ|5.0|Brings back the \\"old days\\" for me, which is High School, and I've discovered that this is one album that stood the test of time, at least in my opinion.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have all of Britney's cds, and this is her best one at far.  It is a great example of techno pop; all of teh songs are great to dancing to.  My favorites are: Piece of Me, Toy Soldier, Get Naked and Break the Ice.  But all in all, this is a great and fun cd.
0316113506|5.0|This book has really gotten me and my family off the couch. It's so inspiring. I hadn't realized that exercise can promote brain-cell growth--the implications of this are huge.

0807014273|5.0|The following summarizes the true meanings the author wants us to absorb.   There are three avenues to arrive at the meaning of life. 1) Creating a work or or doing a deed 2) Experiencing or encountering something added to your life i.e. finding love 3) facing a fate one cannot change. You then rise above oneself, rising above what is expected. One grows from the experience, and experiences positive change.    Experiencing and surviving suffering is something to be proud of... not something to be ashamed of. We all learn and grow from our experiences.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is the fourth time I have replaced this CD.  I wore out the original cassette, then 1 CD someone took from me, and then another CD was broken in a move.  This is my favorite of the Dire Straits music. Can't live without it.
1401302378|4.0|Your special interests, goals, activities and hobbies can make you money. This book will show that money can be made with the most mundane topics and interests. The basic message: we are no longer in an economy where what is most popular wins. To get the most from this book, I had to do a general overview and then go back and tie the book premises together. I think the author missed the opportunity to turn this book into a straightforward manual on what to do. I think the book spent a lot of time on research related material to convince the reader that the premise is promising. With all that there is on the internet about the subject, I would encourage you to read and you tube presentations on the subject, and then buy the book and dissect it looking for the key tools on \\"how\\" to implement your own marketing strategy for your personalized interest, hobby, book or service. The book has some practical things you can do, but it's buried into the mid to later chapters.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is a replacement for the VHS I had.  I love this movie, I always have.  What was interesting was showing this to my Grandson and seeing his reaction.  I remember what it was like seeing it for the first time, and watching him was like reliving all the moments when I saw it.

B00005Y6YB|4.0|The video quality was not the greatest, especially compared to today's standards.  The storyline and the acting are fabulous.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones put in great performances along with Ricky Shroeder and Robert Urlich.  I don't even particularly enjoy Westerns and kind of watched this one for the first time by \\"accident.\\"  Definitely worth another look and definitely worth adding to anyone's library
B000J10ERO|5.0|Most comic fans I've met in the last couple of years really like this new movie vision of \\"Superman\\" -- and that's high praise because comic fans, like myself, are a pretty skeptical lot when it comes to our beloved heroic icons.<br /><br />But there's an important aspect to this particular film version that keeps cropping up in discussions, because I'm a journalist who specializes in reporting on the impact of spirituality in people's lives. Over and over again, people tell me that this movie made them think about their faith and their values concerning social responsibility. That's remarkable for a heavy-duty action flick loaded with special effects.<br /><br />There are thousands of small-discussion groups in congregations across the U.S. looking for ways to kick start their conversations. I'd strongly suggest that groups think of watching this film together and talking about the issues it raises. I know you'll have fun with it -- and countless fans of the film have told me that's precisely where this tale of high-adventure took them.
0670034711|1.0|Here is a book that either changed people's lives or irritated the bejesus out of them. Count me among the latter.     Eat Pray Love - One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert was supposed to enlighten me. It didn't.    OK -- First the positive: Overall, it is a well-written book. The author takes many complicated metaphysical concepts and makes them readable. The book is divided into sections: Eat, which is the author's journey to Italy; Pray, her pilgrimage to India and Love, where she takes a lover in Bali.     This is about a thirty-something woman looking for spirituality and happiness. She is married, but desperately unhappy for no single reason that she cannot or will not divulge. So, she leaves her husband (and, by the way, gives him all marital property out of supposed \\"guilt\\" for leaving him, making me wonder what exactly she did to warrant this)and falls right into another relationship (a-ha! adultery, perhaps?). When the rebound relationship that broke up her marriage falls apart, she now wants to find God. Of course. She claims God spoke to her on the bathroom floor, thus beginning her journey.    But not before she goes to her publisher and secures a $200,000 advance for this book. Makes you wonder, as one reviewer on Amazon pointed out, was the journey retrofitted to the book proposal?     What better way to go find God than in Italy. For four months she eats gelato, practices her Italian with a young man named Luca Spaghetti (If you are going to make up names of allegedly real people, could you find a more sterotypical name? Why not Carmine OrganGrinder?) and gains 23 pounds -- quick to point out to the readers that she was way underweight to beign with.     She learns to enjoy life and be selfish from the Italians - who by the way still find her immensely attractive, although they don't hoot and holler at her like they did 10 years previously. But she is still so damned cute. Just ask her.     On to India. At the Ashram, she learns to meditate and still broods over her lost marriage and subsequent realtionship. Probably the most boring part of the book, except for her conversations with \\"Richard from Texas\\" -- a down home, larger than life character who speaks in folksy platitudes that would make Andy Griffith proud. He also bestows our author with her nickname \\"Groceries\\" because she was emaciated from grief from crying for the millionth time over her beloved David. As one reviewer from Amazon said, \\"What kind of nickname is Groceries?\\"     I honestly believe she made these people up. Reminds me of \\"Go Ask Alice\\" -- supposedly the real story of the drug-addicted Anonymous -- until it was revealed that the protagonist was a fictitious composite of the author's psychiatric patients. Boo.    Then Bali. She ends her self-imposed celibacy with an older Brazilian man. High on orgasmic ecstasy, out of the supposed goodness of her heart, she asks her friends to send $18K in donations to help a single mother, an alleged friend of Ms. Gilbert's, who is portrayed as a con artist because she didn't buy a house in the timeframe coinciding with the termination of Ms. Gilbert's visa. I always thought that a gift should be a gift without strings attached -- especially coming from someone who supposedly found God. I wanted to ask Ms. Gilbert \\"What Would Jesus Do?\\"    My biggest problem with this tome is that this 30-something woman basically is looking for applause for running off for a year, obstensibly supported by a $200K book advance, to \\"find God.\\" I'm sure millions of women would love to leave their everyday lives and travel the world to do nothing but self analyze. If she had done volunteer work, I may have felt differently. If she went through some real hardship, I could sympathize. But she was in an incompatible marriage, then dumped by the guy she left her husband for. She should perhaps speak to those battling life-threatening diseases, or raising children alone, or taking care of an elderly parent, or worried about where their next meal is coming from.    And for all of her self-realization and navel-gazing to end her dependence on men, Ms Gilbert has, as pointed out by anotherAmazon reviewer, married her Brazilian and moved to new Jersey. She could have saved Penguin Books a whole lot of money by getting in her car and going through the Lincoln Tunnel. I wonder how long before she ends up back on the bathroom floor.
B000ELJBAA|2.0|Workmanlike and seldom-inspired, this album finds David Gilmour unsuccessfully attempting to capture the mid-1980s mainstream rock bandwagon. Some artists could pull this off, like Robert Palmer and ZZ Top. Gilmour can't, and as a result his voice sounds harsh and his solos seem frentic and unfocused throughout. The mix is buried in that heavy reverb that so much of 80s pop over-used, and except for \\"Love on the Air,\\" there's almost nothing that holds up to repeated listening.    I strongly suggest passing this over in favor of \\"David Gilmour,\\" which is Gilmour's first and best solo album. Listening to that nearly perfect album again after listening to this only reinforces what a superior collection of songs the earlier album was. Unless you have a strong fondness for 80s corporate rock done by-the-books, I can't imagine anyone listening to this often.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|I purchased this movie along with its sequel T2. Its the clearest transfer to date compared to on DVD. But if your expecting eye-popping detail HD-Clarity, you will not see it here. It looks like a Mpeg2 transfer. Can these movies ever be remastered in HD to give us what we expect, I don't know but I am still highly satisfied to have these movies on a disc that can probably outlast a nuclear war!
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|Easily the best headphone amplifier I've tried! In the past these things were either full of hiss, smothered in echo, or were little more than glorified fuzz boxes with an Walkman-style headset. (That was definitely the case with Vox's discontinued AC1). The Amplug is different. It plugs right into your guitar's output jack, and has distinct tone, gain, and volume controls. No, this doesn't sound like a 100 Watt Vox head shrunk into a palmsize toy. It DOES sound amazingly like a much larger and more expensive amplifier, with very pleasing and tube-like distortion at higher volumes. It's the \\"classic rock\\" model, meaning that it's optimized for the chunky tube-distorted sound of the mid 1970s.     I like the Amplug a lot.     If you're into lead or rhythm guitar in the styles of Free, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, or the Who, you're going to enjoy this as a very valuable and inexpensive practice tool. The sound quality is good enough to use the Amplug as an amp simulator if you want to record your guitar directly to your computer. I think many people would be fooled into thinking you really had a large tube amp if they heard the recording. It's an amazing simulation, and I prefer the tube emulation in it to some digital effects units I've tried. I actually like the fact that it doesn't have built-in reverb as I'd rather use my own reverb when recording than be forced to settle with the built-in type.    Drawbacks? The clean sound is anemic. (This is not the headphone amp to use if you're planning on comping jazz chords with a heavy right hand. I have tried my mandolin with the clean setting and the results were somewhat better due to the double coursed strings.) Also, the Amplug really does require fresh batteries - the sound as the batteries weaken becomes more and more abrasive. As the batteries die, the sound gets progressively irritating. The plug isn't angled, so you're going to have a hard time using this with a Strat-like guitar. (I use a Gibson SG and I don't have thisproblem). The construction is very lightweight plastic that does not inspire my confidence. For a few dollars more, the Amplug could have a metal chassis that would be very durable. None of these things deter me, because I don't expect miracles from a Japanese-made plastic amp. This is in no way a surrogate for a real amp, such as Vox's own DA5, and is very much a single-trick device - but it does its single trick very well.    I bought the Vox Classic Rock amPlug on a whim in a music store. I'm glad I did! It's helped to excite me once more about playing and practicing daily. The price is definitely right, and the distortion sounds are superb. Buy this with the understanding that no amp can do all things and you'll have a great time with it.

0307383415|4.0|Written by Obama when he was 33 years old, before his political career began.  It is really a remarkable book.  He writes well enough to be a professional novelist, plus, it's a great American story.  Highly recommended.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|A guy at a record store was trying to sell this cd to me and it was playing over the loud speakers at the store. I thought it sounded pretty good and purchased the item. I dont really see them as a AC/DC type band, although I can see where people get it from. I think they sound more like a band thats been around for awhile, Nashville Pu$$y. Its a great cd from start to finish, but I would recommend Nashville Pu$$y if you like this record.
B000O78KW4|3.0|A mad bomber (Jeremy Irons) terrorizes New York for a mysterious purpose that will not surprise those who are familiar with the way the stories of this series are constructed.  John McClaine (Bruce Willis), suspended from the New York police force, and an unwitting cabbie (Samuel L. Jackson) get drawn into the non-stop action.    This third installment of the Die Hard series just didn't grab me the way the first two did, but I'm not sure why.  Watching it, I was struck by how outlandish much of the action was, but then some of the scenes in Die Hard 2 were just as ridiculous and I loved that movie.  Perhaps there were just too many clichés, giving the film a tired, by-the-numbers feeling.
B000WCBPOG|3.0|The only way to appreciate this soundtrack album (without having seen the movie) is to look on it as various artists performing Beatles songs. Some performances are good; some are embarrassing; most are just mediocre. Let's face it: The Beatles are a tough act to follow. Nearly every Beatles performance of a Beatles song was perfection, the perfect rendition, the definitive performance. You can't out-do them. As for the cover art (again without knowing the movie), it's weird. What is it, exactly? A bleeding heart? A strawberry on acid?
B0010ZR160|3.0|No. His brother.    This film, like Mystic River, is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane.  But Ben Affleck is no Clint Eastwood, and brother Casey is no Sean Penn.      There may be roles to which Casey Affleck can bring credibility - I'm not familiar with his work - but this is not one of them.  There wasn't a moment I could take him seriously: the role called for someone I could believe had the toughness and experience to negotiate Boston's mean streets; someone who could hold the stage with Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. But Mr. Affleck comes off as a boy in a man's world. (The voice-overs he is called upon to deliver are especially embarrassing - with a better voice and 20 more years under his belt, he might have pulled them off.) The writers do what they can to give him weight.  At one point, fairy early on, Mr. Affleck meets Ed Harris and his partner in a local dive and drops a tidbit of of information on the two detectives, who clearly have been less than enthused with having to include him in their investigation. Without so much as asking Mr. Affleck the basis of his information, the two detectives are off to follow up on it, leaving one to wonder how exactly, between his entrance and the detectives' exit, Mr. Affleck acquired such credibility.      The plot is too clever by half. There were three, perhaps four, points in the film where I thought I was a minute or two from seeing the final credits roll (and, increasingly, was hoping to see them roll).  \\"But wait,\\" as infomercial hucksters love to say, \\"there's more!\\" And the film chugged on, propelled by yet another plot twist. The final one is preposterous: Mr. Freeman's character would have understood how impractical, how doomed to fail, how personally foolish is the course of action the writers foist on him.      The minor roles are filled with competent character actors, but many are so familiar from other roles that I was always aware, despite their skill, that I was watching a group of actors at work, when I should have been transported to the film's world. Michelle Monaghan, as Mr. Affleck's wife, barely registers. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are always watchable, but the former - in a role we've seen him play many times before - gets relatively little screen time, and the latter succumbs, literally, to plot contrivance.  (SPOILER ALERT!  Shot twice through the chest - we see on his shirt where the bullets exit - Mr. Harris not only manages to quickly hoof it about a quarter-mile, he manages to make his way to the roof of a building of several stories, there to recline dramatically against a skylight for his final words with Mr. Affleck, which he manages to deliver without either coughing or exhaling blood.  It makes one wonder just what he expired from, given the fact the two bullets that passed through his chest missed, apparently, both his heart and lungs.)      I was pleased to see two cast members of the HBO series The Wire (the best series on TV, hands down) at work here.  Michael K. Williams appears in a minuscule role; Amy Ryan, as the missing child's druggie mother, turns in the film's best performance. It's unfortunate this film didn't borrow more from that series than just two of its cast.  It would have been a better film for it.
1400063515|1.0|I teach about crisis management and thought this book might be useful in portraying the need to plan for unlikely occurances. Try as I might, I have not been able to get myself to read more than 75 pages and I had to force that. The author apparently made a fortune as a derivitives trader, and wants the world to know about it. He came up with the phrase, the black swan, to describe unlikely but seminal occurances. So far so good, but the rest of the 75 pages anyway has been about how great he is and how his insights have made him rich. Good for him. I have better things to do with my time than read about his unlikely good fortune.
0375424474|5.0|Your Inner Fish is a fun read.  Shubin takes us back to the beginning of   creatures with four limbs and a head, and beyond, then brings us forward   through time illustrating how we are all related.  I especially enjoyed  learning about my inner tadpole, and the hiccup connection.
B000VNMMQG|2.0|There are certain cinematic moments so absolutely perfect that they remain in one's memory, even if the film in which they occur isn't much to write home about.  So it is with \\"Amazing Grace,\\" a movie that manages to take a magnificent story--Wilberforce's long struggle to end slavery in Great Britain--and transform it into a rather tedious and unconvincing script.  Albert Finney's performance as John Newton, the slavetrader turned clergyman and hymn writer, and Michael Gambon's brilliant portrayal of Charles Fox, salvage the film.  Finney has only two scenes (plus a third silent walk-on), and Gambon, although in several scenes, probably has no more than 5 total minutes of speaking time.  But their performances are breath-taking:  Finney as the conscience-tortured ex-slaver, and Gambon as the cynical but wise legislator.<br /><br />Other performances in the film fall short, some of them because the script, written by Stephen Knight is so bad.  Veteran character actor Nicholas Farrell, for example, does his best in his role as Dr. Henry Thorton, but the scriptwriter doesn't give him much to go on.  Benedict Cumberbatch puts in a decent performance as William Pitt, but even he can't pull off the bathetic death scene with which the script encumbers him.<br /><br />Sadly, however, the very worst performance must go to Ioan Gruffudd, who plays Wilberforce.  Gruffudd's talents in the film veer toward loud melodrama rather than subtlety (a surprise, because he's given quite admirable performances in other movies).  In his hands, Wilberforce comes across as both unsympathetic and implausible.<br /><br />In short, a bad, sometimes mawkish script; lackluster performances; and miscasted leading man.  The film had the potential, given its inspiring story, to be as great as (for example) \\"Chariots of Fire.\\"  But it fell far short of that.  Rarely has so little been done with so much.
0765316978|4.0|THE LAST COLONY(2007) is the third book from the OLD MAN'S WAR series.  It keeps up a good pace, with lots of twists, turns, unravelings, and a few good battle scenarios.  It is quite enjoyable throughout, but the story never seems to reach full crescendo.<br /><br />The main characters John Perry and his wife Jane are likeable enough, as are the secondary characters (Secretary Savitri and \\"daughter\\" Zoe), who are assigned to lead up a Human Colony of about 1500 people from various planets, among ever stranger circumstances.<br /><br />The bad guys in the story turn out mostly to be from the Colonial Union itself, and some of the good guys end up coming from the \\"enemy\\" Conclave (a Galactic Power made up of 412 races).<br /><br />I never got a good feel for the character of the Perry's Odin alien compatriots Hickory and Dickory.  I suppose they are described in the previous book from the series THE GHOST BRIGADES, which apparently is a bit of a prerequisite if you want to fully understand all the players in the story.  I read the first book in the series OLD MAN'S WAR, and it offers some insight into the main character's background.<br /><br />In an afterward, the author says that this is probably the last book in the John & Jane Perry series.  I've read one other book from this fairly new author, THE ANDROID'S DREAM... I've found all of Scalzi's books to be enjoyable, but none have yet reached top-notch status.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Before Grunge took over most of the 'metal sound' Ryche released this CD which boosted them from a flat foundation to a sky-is-the-limit platform.  It's an outstanding representation of their music when it was hard and tight.  Their image scored points, their tour was awesome, this earned them their \\"Thinking man's band\\" reputation due to the complexity of the lyrics and hair raising quality of Tate's vocals.  Tribute band often try to replicate the guitar riffs from this CD.  Worth every hard earned dollar (and cent).
0792838068|2.0|Listen hip film auteur. This is why the film industry is dying. They take some decent actors and make them live out a miserable life for your entertainment. Did I say entertainment? Oh! Roger Ebert thought it was the best film of 1995. Well, it was the Clinton years, those merry days when Hollywood perverts could indulge their fantasy without interference from pesky terrorists. Out of sight, out of mind.    Drama is not comedy after all. Some of the best works of art are all about suffering.  King Lear ain't no comedy, but we care about the foolish old coot who denies his most virtuous daughter leading to the collapse of his kingdom. Nick Cage isn't Lear.  No, there's no nobility, just a drunk with occasional hysteria and his Las Vegas working girl. She's not exactly Ophelia either. Together they have love in a barren desert. Monica Lewinski, where are you? Are you kidding? This must be that Hollywood producer love. Personally, if I wanted to see nudity and adult activities, then there's the work of Tracy Lords, so why would I pay to see a silly whiskey on-the-chest scene. Oh, I got so turned on.    There are great dramas in the 1950's about alcoholics. The audiences were entertained and possibly illuminated. Usually they were written by Tennessee Williams and played with finesse by Paul Newman. We saw their struggle and pitied their battle with booze. Sometimes they recovered. In Days of Wine and Roses, Jack Lemmon does and his screen wife, Lee Remick doesn't. Heartbreaking, but LLV is hollow Hollywood existentialism with no soul and that's why we don't care.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is a fabulous album. I'm glad they changed their style from SAJ - thats creative evolution! Madonna's been known to do that why can't Maroon 5.

B000001GJU|5.0|I hear something special in Karajan's late recordings with the Vienna Phil., an orchestra that brought out the most affectionate detail and sunniest mood in him. Besides this \\"New World,\\" his third in the modern era, there's an inspiring Dvorak 8th, the last three Tchaikovsky symphonies, and legendary valedictory readings of the Bruckner Seventh and Eighth. The conductor wasn't to die for another four years when this \\"New World\\" was made, so we can't call it a farewell, and it's by no means as dreamy and laid back as the 8th from Vienna. Even so, it holds its own fascinaiton simply because of where it falls in Karajan's whole career.<br /><br />As remastered, the mid-eighties digital sound has been tamed, but you need to be prepared for some snarling brass climaxes. The edges here are rougher than in Karajan's previous version on DG, from 1964. That one has reappeared in great sound on a two-fer in the Karajan Forever series (he never minded adulation, but outright idolarty seems excessive). Tempos are a fraction slower in the first movement from Vienna and a fraction faster in the Largo, but the overall interpretation remaines much as it was decades before. You'll hear extra lilt from the Viennese strings -- how could they not provide that? -- and tastier, less suave woodwind playing. The reedy quality of the English horn in the Largo falls nicely on the ear.<br /><br />But don't expect rusticity or a special Czech flavor; this is big-city, echt Deautsche music-making. The Scherzo keeps up the prevailing strength of the whole reading (i.e., it's not dance-like), and the finale is robust and direct without bending over backwards to deliver a knockout punch. In the end, the recorded sound is bettter than on Kertesz's \\"New World\\" form Vienna in the Sixties, and the interpretation is at least as strong as Kondrashin's, also from Vienna on Decca. The CD is filled out with Smetana's Moldau, not exactly a rarity but welcome for the gorgeous, bubbling freshness of the orchestra's tone and for Karajan's suprisingly dreamy way with the score. You'd never guess that this is a warhorse.estra's tone and for Karajan's suprisingly dreamy way with the score. You'd never guess that this is a warhorse.

0895260131|1.0|I like some of the Politically Incorrect books but in some of them  \\"politically incorrect\\" becomes a synonym for \\"basically ignorant\\".

Cherrypicking quotes, showing off ignorance of both Islamic and Christian history in the ME, and pursuing a politically biased agenda does not a revelation make.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|JC never worried about \\"crossing the line\\" (he'd walk the line) when it came to musical guests. This anthology is a time-capsule of the most interesting music of the late 60's and early 70's. Watch, listen, learn.
B00000I41J|1.0|4 stars for the music: it sounds like Davis' first quintet on the Prestige label - very good but not great. The reason for the single star is the 1998 transfer is awful: the treble is boosted far too high, with the result that Davis (and sometimes Adderley, too) sounds shrill above the stave, and the piano accompaniment is lost in the background. I suspect RVG was trying to give Miles the \\"Blue Note sound\\", but Miles isn't Lee Morgan (and I love Lee) and doesn't fit the mold. He's too introspective, his sound more diffuse than bright.    Blue Note needs to remaster this title to restore Miles to his rightful self.

B000MM1F6E|5.0|The Pixies have never sounded so good in this hybrid SACD edition of their first full length album.  The only people to have heard the Pixies sound this way were the original studio engineers it's that good.  Every detail stands out and the stereo image is so good you can pick out the layers of vocals and guitars.  The bass is detailed and thick.  For the audiophile that is even a marginal fan of the Pixies this is a must purchase title.
B00006F83Y|5.0|So i've never been much of a heavy metal (where the singer's lyrics can't be discrened because he's jsut screaming) enthuse because i never saw the music in the stuff. So that being said, first track, BOOM, thats all i can say. It's so in your face rockin that you just can't ignore it. With the bassist Nick Oliveri wailing away on most of the vocals and the lead singer/rythim guitarist Josh Homme holdin down the riffs, it's a song like i havent heard in, well, ever. The albums energy continues all the way through, though i'm not a big fan of the track Shooter, everything else is absolutely essential for any rock fan. As it is a bit of a concept type album in certain aspects, it's a bit like a Pink Floyd album for hard rockers. So whether you like it because it's got that stoner music vibe, or you're just looking for something new, don't overlook this album.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This is a movie about life and sexuality, Straight, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have purchased over 15 copies and give them to friends and family.  It is a movie that every adult should see. It makes you realize that we are all alike in our needs to be loved, and that sexual orientation or gender has nothing to do with those needs. We are all human, and all are seeking the same thing in life.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|Like most, my first experience with Vampire Weekend was during one of the rare occasions when MTV actually plays music videos, and they just happened to be playing the video for \\"A-Punk\\".  After catching the video several times before Vampire's release date, I decided that 7.99 was a reasonable price to pay for any cd containing such a cool song.  I honestly didn't expect anything more than a future one hit wonder, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I've owned it for about a week now, and I've listened to the whole album about five times.  Each time I listen to it, I find something else I like about it, which doesn't seem to happen all that much anymore.  Almost every song has at least a small portion that will be stuck in your head all day, clawing at your brain, until you listen to it again.  Of course, then you'll have a different song stuck in your head, and the cycle continues.  My personal favorites are \\"I Stand Corrected\\", \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\", and \\"A-Punk\\".  For some reason, they really remind me of \\"The Walkman\\", and according to the bands MySpace page, they'll actually be doing a few shows with them, so that will be pretty cool.  Seriously though, aside from being MTV darlings (of course that's where I saw them, so what does that say about me), these guys have a lot going for them, and they deserve a listen.
B0011HOEY4|2.0|The problem I've noticed with a lot of gangsta flicks is that the fate of the Dons are too often predicted.  That's one of the many problems that plague American Gangster.  The story is your typical run of a mill rise and fall of a major druglord (in this case Frank Lucas)- with no innovative spins on the typical story. The story is seqeunced in a manner where you can pretty much predict what's going to happen next if you watch a lot of gangsta movies. Outside of the fact that Frank Lucas implemented a set of business strategies unheard of the in the drug game, He just comes off as your typical drug dealer( one who feeds off intimidation, makes it to the top and help his relatives, and let's not forget that he has to have a dimepiece to supplement his thugged out ego). And the whole idea of him buying his mom a beautiful house gets old real fast.    Russel Crowe's role as the flawed good guy looking to build a case against Farank Lucas is uneventful at best and Denzel Washington is simply phoning it in with his role as the major don.  Another issue with the movie is the pacing is too slow to pay attention to the few little interesting parts of the movie. While the action does pick up in the last hour of the movie,  the heavy reliance on cliches brings the movie down. Had this movie been directed by Antione fuqua ( Training Day), this movie could've been worth something but if you're looking for some real entertainment within this genre check out The Wire, The Sopranos, Good Fellas, and New Jack City.
B000002H92|5.0|Like that other great, dead rock star Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison has had his legacy grow beyond even the mythic status it was when he was alive. Like Hendrix, Jimbo created an image that became a crippling anchor around his neck. Doomed by his own vanity and the trappings of success, he died too young and left behind a scattershot collection of writings, recordings, and other works that have been ravenously picked over, packaged, and re-packaged for the greed and notoriety of the remaining band members. The recent deluge of live concerts, some so embarrassing one wonders just how far greed will go given the appetite of the Morrison faithful, and the senseless re-mastering of their studio catalog to the exclusion of the originals (all of which are \\"currently unavailable\\" on Amazon) demonstrate that there is no limit to the manner in which a seemingly limited body of work can be parsed and re-treaded ad nauseum to keep the money train rolling. I often wonder what Hendrix, Morrison, et al would think of the handiwork of those whom they left behind. I'm guessing they'd be ashamed and angry and they'd have every right to be.<br />And so, The Doors In Concert...as many reviews have stated, this is a combination platter of Alive She Cried and Absolutely Live with two extra cuts tacked on from the Hollywood Bowl concert. Absolutely Live is worth the price on it's own and the addition of the posthumous release Alive She Cried, a well done compilation of songs from various shows over the years, makes owning this comprehensive live document worth the extra few bucks. You get it all, Jim's audience manipulation, the tight blues and jazz vibe of the musicians, and the poetry. The songs provide a solid argument that Jim's best \\"poetry\\" was lyrics. Hearing his writings, particularly the complete Celebration of the Lizard piece, sung and set to music and delivered in Morrison's deep croon is truly the way it should be experienced. Reading his poetry without the music and the baritone delivery, as can be done via his poetry collections, only highlights the pretension and disconnected inconsistencies of his writings. The death obsessed macabre rambling in the live version of The End that closes disc two is neither brilliant nor deep, it's just silly and juvenile. Hey, I'm in my twenties and fascinated by death...don the black clothing and light some patchouli quick before I become self-aware. Honestly, I think Morrison himself, had he shook off his puerile need to drink himself to death and made it to his sixtieth birthday would be exceedingly embarrassed at his own overly dramatic and painfully overzealous tripe.<br />If it sounds like I'm knocking the group, I'm not at all. I love the Doors - the band - and I think Morrison was a great front man. This is a great live album well worth five stars and the price tag. But let's face it, as a poet Jim Morrison was one helluva great lead singer.elivery, as can be done via his poetry collections, only highlights the pretension and disconnected inconsistencies of his writings.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|I saw Blade Runner when it was released in Beirut in 1983. I remember going to Hamra street, an avenue filled with movie theaters, and I just saw the poster of the film, and I decided to check it out. The civil war in Beirut was raging at the time, and one of the only distraction we could have was going to cinemas, plus movie theaters were like  bomb shelters.    And two hours passed as if I was suspended in time, gone into a new zone, where nothing outside mattered anymmore.   I got this strange feeling: I belonged to the film, I became part of the set, I felt like hovering above the city with Olmos; it felt possible and accessible; one day we'll have that. Then there was Sean Young. Few years earlier, I fell in love with Carrie Fisher, I had Star Wars poster on my wall; but Young, my God, who's this woman?   I was so overwhelmed during teh film. Went and saw it over and over; my friends couldn't understand where's the fuss; they were into realism because the civil war and what not, they were into social messages and big themes etc...Blade Runner IS realism. It will look like that. Whatever...  After emigrating to Los Angeles, I went downtown looking for the Biltmore; at the time it was still rundown, ravaged by time; but at least, I got to see where it all happened. I thought maybe it did.  ziad

B000PKG7I4|4.0|I bought Back to Black before this one so I was expecting it to be a bit more like that one. It isn't, but I was not disappointed. Her voice is just amazing! Highly recommended if you enjoy the bluesy/jazzy music and wish it would be more available.
0385340559|4.0|Look, it's Lee Child. It's Reacher. Some things are given, like the inevitable details on weapons and ammo. Other things are also given, like a terrific premise and Reacher's busy and calculating mind. The only reason for four stars is this one takes awhile to get moving after the wham-bam first chapter. Definitely worth the ride.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|no words can describe it. i never thought i would ever buy an 11 hour documentary series but nothing beats this series.  You just have to buy it.  Anything else i say about it won't be able to do it justice.
B000002GK1|5.0|Considering grunge music isn't known for its wailing lead vocals or experimental textures (aside from, maybe, Dinosaur Jr., but that's another story), Soundgarden certainly defined their own sound. On \\"Badmotorfinger\\", the twelve songs, filling in at over 57 minutes, demonstrate their versatile sound. And with song titles like \\"Room A Thousand Years Wide\\" and \\"Face Pollution\\", you know this is gonna be an interesting album.<br />For starters, let me say the band has quality musicianship. Chris Cornell is one of the greatest singers out there, and he proves it to you over and over. Kim Thayil stomps out some of the trippiest ten-ton riffs around and adds a unique feeling to the band's sound. Ben Shepherd and Matt Cameron also prove themselves a strong rhythm section, rounding out the quartet.<br />Like I was saying, \\"Badmotorfinger\\" demonstrates the band's versatile sound. Even from the first three songs, they go from the hard-rocking psychedelia of \\"Rusty Cage\\" to the sludge-riffing heavy metal of \\"Outshined\\", and the grunge/experimental rock of \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\".<br /> Oh, and it doesn't let up there. They show a hardcore punk influence on \\"Face Pollution\\" (also featuring an almost Frank Zappa-styled progressive-rock measure) and \\"Drawing Flies\\", which also shows the use of horns and a Black Sabbath-styled boogie.<br /> In addition, they show a keen sense of melody and more high-pitched wailing on \\"Holy Water\\". Plus, a really strong sense of songwriting is shown in \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\". It goes from a nice, relaxed feel to an epic build up with some great guitar work at the end.<br /> Overall, I feel that \\"Badmotorfinger\\" is definitely a five-star classic. If you're interested in a heavy, experimental album with great musicianship, odd time signatures, passionate vocals and great hooks, this is something you're gonna treasure. Thanks for the time, and peace.

B0012QE4OO|2.0|At first, I honestly couldn't tell if \\"Jumper\\" was a milestone of science fiction camp or just a really bad movie. Moments of this film are so obviously ridiculous that it's difficult to imagine their inclusions as unintentional. Consider the fact that Hayden Christensen's character--who has the ability to teleport himself to wherever he wants--literally ends up atop famous landmarks, such as the face of Big Ben, or the head of the Sphinx; honestly, doesn't this seem like an inside joke on the filmmaker's part? But after a while, I had to admit to myself that it wasn't supposed to be campy and that I wasn't having fun. This movie is just plain frustrating, not only because it fails to tell a coherent story, but also because it assumes we'll understand it even though it doesn't explain itself. Watching \\"Jumper\\" is like playing a video game without knowing the rules, what the goal is, or even how to use the controller.    The science fiction element is probably the most frustrating thing of all, simply because it's an intriguing concept that has nothing to fall back on. It can't even rely on the plot, which can't be described without falling through one of its numerous holes. Example: the prologue establishes that small-town Detroit boy David Rice discovered the power to transport himself at age fifteen (Max Thieriot), when he ended up in a library after walking on a frozen lake and falling through some thin ice. But wait a minute--as an adult (Christensen) in the story proper, he's informed that he first transported at age five. If that's true, then I have a hard time believing he'd forget something like that for ten straight years.    Never mind; what is clear is that David's power--called Jumping--can take him across any distance, from a few feet to a few thousand miles. And indeed, he Jumps all over the world on any given day, using only a postcard or a mental image to get him to his destination (and that makes we wonder about the moment he saved himself from drowning at age fifteen, since I can't imagine him visualizing a library). Oh, and in case you're wonder how David supports himself, it should be noted here that he's a very rich young man, living in one of New York City's most expensive areas. He's never been a hard worker, but he can steal money by jumping to and from sealed bank vaults. He eventually uses that money to take his high school sweetheart--Millie (Rachel Bilson)--on a trip to Rome. He, of course, doesn't Jump there, since that would be telling her too much too soon. But considering how annoying and unbelievable she is, I don't think it would have mattered a great deal.    We're soon introduced to a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), and that's when the story really gets confusing. Roland, you see, is the leader of the Paladins, a group dedicated to hunting down and destroying every last Jumper on earth. As for why Roland does this, all he ever says is, \\"Only God should have the power to be in all places at once.\\" He also says that, sooner or later, all Jumpers turn bad. What he doesn't say is why or how, nor does he even hint at a Paladin back-story, such as how long they've been chasing Jumpers and why they feel so threatened by them. That would have been helpful, don't you think? Roland shows his angry side by shocking Jumpers with metal rods that shoot out electrified wires; this wouldn't have been a problem had the film actually attempted to explain what these weapons were.    David soon learns that he's not the only Jumper. Here enters Griffin (Jamie Bell), an antisocial hothead who hunts Paladins from his shack in the middle of one of the world's deserts. He says that he's been tracking David for the past ten years, which is difficult to understand since he looks about as old as David does, maybe even younger. He also says that he lost his parents when he was only five, and this was because the Paladins discovered his ability to Jump. Again, I ask why. And again, I say never mind, because I haven't even gotten to the final major sequence, which sees Millie trapped in Roland's clutches, awaiting David to return from a showdown with Griffin.    Have I made it clear just how infuriating this movie is? Probably not--this review is just as rambling and confused as the film itself. \\"Jumper\\" is all action but no setup, a cool-looking science fiction thriller that tells us nothing but expects us to be entertained nonetheless. My biggest beef related to David's back story, a classic case of feeling unloved and unwanted; when he was only five, his mother (Diane Lane) left him and his abusive, alcoholic father (Michael Rooker), so by the time he turned fifteen, he had had enough rejection in his life. I won't reveal why his mother left, although I will say that her reasons only added more questions to an ever-growing list. This movie can do nothing more than raise questions, which makes me wonder if director Doug Liman intentionally left the explanations out of the final cut. Here's hoping that fixing this film is as simple as releasing an exhaustively re-cut extended version; it might be something I can watch without feeling so damn lost.
B000A176VU|5.0|After recently finishing, and greatly enjoying, Ken Follett's [[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth (Deluxe Edition) (Oprah's Book Club)]], I was determined to finally read [[ASIN:B000A176VU Eye of The Needle]].  This book has been on my list of must reads for over 5 years.  Thank goodness I finally read the book.  The Eye of the Needle is a thoroughly enjoyable read with great characters; especially uber-villain Dae Nadel.<br /><br />Essentially, this book surrounds true events leading to the Allies invasion of Normandy in World War II.  There are meetings with Churchill and Hitler and their top advisors in this book.  Follett does and excellent job of taking the reader to Great Britain during the time of the Blackouts.  Many sub-plots abound in this excellent read.  The Eye of the Needle has received much critical acclaim over the years.  In my opinion, the acclaim is well-deserved.  A highly recommended 5-star read.
0805079831|5.0|I'm about 150 pages into this fascinating book and I think it should be required reading for every american. It is my fervent hope that this book puts one of the final nails into the coffin of Corporate rule that is ruining, not just America, but the world.  I read her  book \\"No Logo\\" and this is even better. Read it and pass it on. This book will change history. IF enough people read it. From the amount of 5 star reviews on this site this book could create a  conversation or meme that would make it happen. Thanks, Naomi!
B00109T5WY|4.0|This is instrumental post-rock, which means long songs that take a while to develop and no attention-grabbing choruses.  Some would probably find it boring, but I enjoy it quite a bit.  I often like to read while listening to music, and some bands work better for this than others.  This Will Destroy You's self-titled first full length album is great for it.  Nearly every track is a slow burn, either building a melody to a chilling, hard crescendo or just letting it linger for several minutes.  The band knows how to play their instruments, and there is great artistry and subtle beauty in the textures they weave.  There has to be something that lets them hold a tune so simple for so long without boring me.    Besides the normal rock standards of guitar, drum, and bass, they also include some simple electronic elements in a few of the songs.  Not much, maybe just a drum loop or something to add a little twist to the sound.  I'm not too well versed in post-rock, but they've been compared favorably to elements of Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, two bands I know to be favorites of the genre.  It's not exactly something to throw on at parties, but as a personal experience, it can be quite interesting.  I won't point out favorite tracks, because they're all pretty consistent and entertaining.  The real difference is whether they build to an epic climax or not, and I enjoy it when they do.

B000VR824S|5.0|owning the Crossroads concert in Texas made me anixous to buy this DVD and hear some more great music live. I wasn't disappointed and think this DVD is far better then the Dallas Texas show though that was a good one too. I had tickets to this show but because of health problems I had to miss it. So getting to buy this DVD made up for missing out an a truely fantasic experience. The second disc with Clapton and others just brought goose bumps to my skin it was sooo great. Hearing alot of my old Cream favorites also made this well worth the purchase. I should have gone to the concert. After seeing the DVD I missed out on one incredible show.
0743420373|2.0|The message of this book is very good - it's about being conservative with our wealth.  However, I wish the authors were a bit more conservative with the use of their lengthy descriptions of esoteric points.  It's as if somewhere along the way they said, \\"why should we say in 10 words what we could say in 100,000?\\"  If they just got to the point you could read the whole book in about an hour.
B00005JPUN|2.0|2 stars because I save 1 star for films that are absolutely horrible and this film is not quite that bad [but almost].I have not seen the original, but the first paragraph in the February 15 review by David Jenkins sums up THIS film very succinctly.

0800141849|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie on TV. Bought it simply to know I could see it anytime at my leisure. This 'mind over matter' romance totally revolves on mutual respect and appreciation of each other without any sex and prove this type of relationship would last the longest. Well she realizes it's not enough and wants more but he balks at the idea at first. He acts upset and dissappointed that she wants to change all the rules of the game! She has to leave him to make him come to his senses and realize he loves her too. Barbara Streisand really showed me her acting ability in this movie. Hope you can enjoy it as much as I always do.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|IF ELVIS PRESLEY IS THE KING.............    ....  MICHAEL JACKSON IS GOD !! !! !!        I usually do reviews but in very rare cases like this, I don't need to. FIVE STARS!! and So,  All the negative talk about his court cases, his appearance, and other B S you want to throw this only shows your jealousy & stupidity. You didn't mind Elvis being withh that underage tramp so, give it up. Elvis touched (mostly) ONE race. Michael touched them ALL. Elvis copied Black music & moves. Michael RE-CREATED it & them!! Even other entertainers in all genres of music, are jealous of this man, and with good reason. Before anyone did anything, Elvis stole everything. Michael simply took it back and wiped the Presley stank off of it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So a friend of mine gushed and gushed about this show, and the associated movie...ALL THE TIME. Didn't really explain the whole overview, but claimed it was the most-borrowed set of DVD's in his collection.    So, for once, I do no research of my own, and just go buy it.    So it shows up at my house, I put disc one in the HD-DVD and get ready to enjoy...    HOLY COW. What is this???? It's Cowboys...IN SPACE.     I flashed back to the Muppets, groaned internally at my wasted $$, then realized that I could not shut it off. Watched the whole series AND Serenity the movie in about 3 days. The premise seemed totally bizarre to me, yet somehow ... it worked.
B000TSIK14|4.0|Well, I have to admit it.  I did NOT see this coming!  Until now, my experience with the Scorpions has been largely relegated to a minor status, due to it coming mostly from a single \\"Best of\\" disc.  This album has encouraged me to delve deeper, with a sense of immediacy!<br /><br />Heavy, powerful, and full of great energy, these German metal icons have managed to put out a very strong album, well into their careers.  Needless to say, I'm impressed with what I've heard.  Humanity Hour 1 is wonderfully melodic, with a nice balance of softer and heavier tracks, and it keeps a listener's interest throughout.  A very good album!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This is an incredible DVD of Celine and what she does best!  My wife and I are going to see her in Boston this coming August! We can't wait!
B000AADYYO|5.0|As always, Opeth present us, the listeners, with an album that is simultaneously brutal at points, and serenely beautiful at others.  I've heard other bands do the same, though in truth no artist manages to so perfectly interweave the two forms.<br /><br />There's very little bad I can say about Ghost Reveries, except that it doesn't quite live up to the phenomenally good Blackwater Park.  It is, perhaps, the most melodic of Opeth's releases, and somewhat less heavy than the band has been on recent efforts, yet it's still a fantastically good album.  All parts are performed to the highest levels.  The clean vocals are beautiful and Akerfeldt is able to convey a range of emotions, and the unclean vocals are similarly effective in giving the music great depth.  The rhythm section is impeccable, as usual, contributing to the album's sense of timing, the changes in tempo, and the unusual beats that are common in Opeth's progressive style of metal, and their efforts on this album are incredibly important.  The guitar work, as I've come to expect from Opeth, is also top notch.  Really a very strong album.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|[[ASIN:B000R7I3LY Little Voice]]    Such a powerful voice that just keeps your attention.  You have this CD in your player for a long time.  Sara's talent is amazing and we can only look forward to her future.
B00005OAE6|4.0|Is there anything better than the version of \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\" done by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band?  Not for my money, there isn't.<br /><br />And 1978's Stranger in Town is full of great rockin' tracks like that.  \\"Hollywood Nights\\" is a true rock n' roll classic, and \\"Feels Like a Number\\" and \\"Ain't Got No Money\\" have that same bluesy rockin' vibe that infuses this album with a good amount of old fashioned rock n' roll fun.<br /><br />This is balanced by Seger's great ability to pen a more thoughtful, softer rock tune, as he does in \\"Still the Same,\\" \\"We've Got Tonite,\\" and \\"The Famous Final Scene.\\"<br /><br />It all adds up to a great, classic album.  Not Seger's best, but still very strong and thoroughly enjoyable.

0525950079|3.0|Like so many others, I looked forward with great anticipation to the \\"Pillars\\" sequel. I've enjoyed Ken Follett's work, dating back to \\"Eye of the Needle\\". Recently, though, his tomes have become predictable and, sorry to say, poorly written. \\"World Without End\\" fits this description.   Mr. Follett has a reputation for historical accuracy in his fiction. While \\"World\\" does have a good representation of this - his description of English battle techniques is a fine example - he adds other historical tidbits to this book as one might add a few extra vegetables to the stew. They improve the overall flavor, yet it remains, basically, stew.\\"Pillars\\" delved more deeply into the mechanics and lifestyle of the times. \\"World\\" uses the history as window dressing for a mediocre medieval soap opera.   The main characters are consistent in one- and two-dimensional ways. Merthin, the builder, comes up with architectural ideas the way Star Trek captains discover ways to avoid being swallowed by black holes. Caris, the healer, is a feminista in a time when that particular frame of mind would hardly have been tolerated. If bras had been worn in 14th century England, she would have found a way to burn hers.   My main objection to Mr. Follett's opus continues a critique I've had since the dreadful \\"Hornet's Flight\\" came out. His prose has become stilted, simplistic and yes, predictable. There are times when the dialog borders on anachronistic. When one pair of lovers are discussing the happy coincidence of a straw bed pallet in a mason's work room, the woman notes it's nice to have \\"a soft place\\" for \\"the workers' tools.\\" Who knows? Maybe the folks in 1380 did enjoy the occasional double entendre. To me, it seemed out of place and out of time.   Overall, there were very few surprises in the story line, other than implausible ones needed to keep characters from dying too soon. The bad guys are sneeringly nasty; the good guys win in the end, despite religious fanaticism, feudal cruelty and... oh, yes, the plague.   Wait for the paperback or buy it used.
B000MGBSI0|3.0|Season 2, though enticing in its twists and turns, is painful to watch owing to its wretched picture quality. Even on a Sony Bravia 32\\" by way of a blue-ray player(blue ray improves the picture of even regular DVD's by 2.5 times) there is visible fuzz on the screen. I cannot imaging watching this on a regualar TV and a standard DVD player. It's laughable how bad the characters look thanks to an abysmal video transfer. CBS needs to publish Melrose Place on blue-ray to make the show watchable, lest fans cringe like Michael when he learned Kimberly was \\"dead.\\"  I realize all older shows leave something to be desired in terms of picture quality, but this is a mess! Here's hoping the DVD sets of Season 3 or 4 are better.
0525950079|3.0|I thought that many interesting sub-plots were skipped over to keep the book within 1000 pages and that this made the book less powerful than \\"The Pillars Of The Earth\\".

If you're someone who appreciate nature and animals, you will be totally blown away by the footage, the quality, and will really think about what's happening to the world. Just brilliant work. Makes you little sad, that potentially in few years many of these animals may be extinct.  Very powerful, dramatic collection recommended for everyone.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I loved...how this video was in her home with the same amount of space I had to work with, she was wearing normal workout clothes and no makeup (not all pretend like so many videos), it was just her and not 6 people on a stage, she didn't have loud and outdated music in the background, how we didn't do the grapevine and other stupid dances the whole time, it was just plain variations of squats & lunges. If I made a workout video this is exactly how  I'd do it.<br /><br />Every week I walk & use elliptical twice and do yoga and I felt this video to be a very good workout. I couldn't keep up the first time around (8 months pregnant), but love that it will challenge me the next few weeks until the labor. It is great preparation with all the squatting too. I think it would be a great workout for non-pregnant people---she really challenges you it's not \\"warm up\\" video.

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|While this film is beautifully acted and a stunning visual treat it is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. This movie should be enjoyed and looked at as an example of the myth surrounding Elizabeth but it is not a history lesson. If you really want to know more about the real Elizabeth please read books by Carole Levin, Susan Doran, or even an older scholar, Alison Plowden but please, enjoy the movie as just a movie.
B000PY52EU|1.0|This was a bad movie in my opion can't agree with  the other reviews the plot was stupid please don't  waste you're time i had to force myself to get through it!
074356619X|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to The Secret, however, everything in \\"The Secret\\" is actually based on \\"The Law of Attractions\\" which has been taught by Esther and Jerry Hicks \\"The Teachings of Abraham\\". \\"The Secret\\" is great and a fabulous way to get you excited about really wanting to learn more on the processes to help you deliberately create, intend, and allow \\"The Teachings of Abraham\\" is the way to go.  It's not just the fluff it's the tools you need to help you get what you really want out of life.  Happy Learning to all!
B0000793ZA|4.0|The songs on this record are in general excellent, but the first four are classics -- four of the greatest songs recorded in the 1980s:  \\"Up on the Catwalk\\", \\"Book of Brilliant Things\\", \\"Speed Your Love to Me\\" and \\"Waterfront\\" are incredible and the record is worth getting for these tracks alone.
B0000032LS|4.0|I've been a die hard Rocky fan for years. I've taken part in many a midnight showing and I've only just now bought an \\"offical\\" soundtrack (many a burned copy has passed through these hands) to the film. Not a negative word has passed my lips except for the absence of one key song. \\"The Sword of Damoclese\\" is not on this album. Bummer as this is one rockin' song and I had to resort to piracy to complete my perfect soundtrack. Other than that...Fantastic. That's enough of the downers for me. Rock on!!!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|Putting the songs in order is quite a simple process, and it immediately changed my opinion of the album (for the better). I highly recommend doing so. Soundtracks SHOULD be the emotional direction of the movie, and ignoring their chronological order limits the listener's connection to the actual movie. And as for the soundtrack itself, NO ONE is John Williams, and Pat Doyle and Nick Hooper don't try to be. I love JW, but I can also appreciate a unique spin now and then. Let us just hope that he scores the final film (as it would be fitting to see how he would finish the score he so famously started).<br /><br />HOPE THIS HELPS...<br /><br />1. Another Story<br />2. Dementors in the Underpass<br />3. Flight of the Order of the Phoenix<br />4. The Ministry of Magic<br />5. A Journey to Hogwarts<br />6. Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning<br />7. Professor Umbridge<br />8. The Sacking of Trelawney<br />9. Dumbledore's Army<br />10. The Room of Requirements<br />11. The Kiss<br />12. Darkness Takes Over<br />13. Fireworks<br />14. The Sirius Deception<br />15. The Hall of Prophecies<br />16. Death of Sirius<br />17. Possession<br />18. Loved Ones and Leaving<br /><br />Edit: In the comments that followed my review, reviewer K. Brinkert provided an even more accurate listing of the soundtrack (a few of the middle tracks were out of chronological order). Thusly I edited my initial review to reflect his super helpful findings. Cheers K. Brinkert!
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|The title says it all.  This CD is great.  I love every song, and these kids are really talented.  The lead singer's voice and range is inspiring.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is a terrific CD showcasing the wonderful music of the motion picture by the same name.  It's relaxing, profound, and at times great fun!  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys modern alternative, indie, or clasic Irish tunes.  Joni Mitchell fans will love it to!
B00008G6EZ|3.0|I purchased this DVD on the strength of the opinion of one of Amazon's most active reviewers.  However, for once his evaluation let me down.  When I see Harnoncourt listed as conductor I am assured that his tempi will be erratic...but usually not better.  The sets (when there are any) are pretty awful.  The last half of the opera takes place in front of an unidentifiable structure that looks for all the world as if they simply set fire to the set from a previous show and left it on the stage.<br /><br />Gilfrey is clearly a major talent with a pleasing appearance, beautiful voice and considerable acting abilty.  But with his long hair loose in the last scene he looks too much like an American Indian.  His side kick, played by the great Hungarian Bass Polgar looks much too seedy to be a servant of a Don with obviously unlimited means to entertain. Leaving him unshaven, and scruffily so, makes him look like a homeless person...would Don Giovanni allow his \\"frontman\\" to look like that? Among the singers Bartoli is the biggest drawback.  When they first see her, Ottavio and Anna comment on her \\"noble aspect.\\"  Yet Bartoli plays her like a schrieking fishwife.  I have never succumbed to Bartoli's charm and see evidence that, since she has been pushing her voice for years, the instrument is showing signs of a badly spread vibrato in loud passages.<br /><br />The biggest problems, however, lie with the director.  In scene one Donna Anna sings about her father \\"His limbs are cold, he no longer breathes.\\"  But she sings this 10 feet away from the corpse while looking intently at the floor in front of her. (she hasn't been near the body as yet) At various points Don Giovanni plants a kiss on Leporello's cheek.  It seems totally out of character for the time and for the character's station in life.  What purpose does this serve? Has the director read the libretto?  Does he understand Italian?<br /><br />As much as I dislike Vpn Karajan's conductorial tyranny, I have to go backto his version as my DVD of choice.
1400064287|5.0|Great sticky stories. Read this book if you want to learn why some ideas 'fly' and others flop. Super analysis. Entertaining read.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|I am really in favor of experimental vocals, new instruments, and timing change-ups... but there are those who accomplish such variations gracefully and innovatively, and then there's Panic!.  I have never heard someone with such a whiny voice cram so many non-rhythmic syllables into one \\"sentence\\".  It's really a strain on my aural senses.  Maybe the beats are catchy... and maybe there is some decent instrumentation - but holy jesus does that voice make me want kick my radio in while driving.  This stuff is really meant for kids 13 and below, so I don't expect too much.  But when you have two friends in their mid-20's giving this album some credit, I had to check it out.  The Cringe-factor is hovering somewhere about 9.5 out of 10 (with Fergie holding it down at a flat 10)
B0000793Z9|5.0|Had the original on vinyl you know the translucent one with the colours swirling in it so sorry i cant seem to find it anymore. but the memories are just great still. put this on and close your eyes its seems to lift you even only in spirit.
B00000K31V|4.0|This movie is out there but it is a classic Sci-Fi fantasy title with an eerie setting.  Best watched in the dark after the sun has set.  One of its tag lines; \\"... makes The Matrix seem like child's play\\"; may be a stretch, but it is definitely worth picking up if you love Sci-Fi and have not seen it yet.
1401302378|4.0|This book was given to me after I expressed how much I liked Gladwell's Tipping Point. The Long Tail was, for me, the less edgy cousin to TP and I liked it very much. Gets into a new world of business economics and cites specific applications. I particularly liked the sections dedicated to the music industry.    One odd note: I'd never heard anyone talk about the Rhapsody music service in all my life and I felt a little like this was a commercial for them.    Overall a good read and worth the time spent.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Not sure how historically accurate or true to the original story this is and not a fan of fight/war films, but that aside, this is a sight to behold--visually stunning.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|You will read from some other reviews that this film is flawed in the ending. I won't disagree with that. But I will say that even with the \\"flawed\\" ending, this is still one of the most amazing films shot in the last decade. The cinematography is stunning. The audio is amazing. The concepts and intelligence displayed in the execution of the story and plot are highly engaging and well done. The special effects are top notch, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Oh yeah, and the acting is first rate as well! If you are a fan of intelligent science fiction, along the lines of Solaris (another great movie for intelligent adults), then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. You may debate about the ending, but that is really only 10 or 15 minutes of an amazing experience.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|While this album may be 22 years old, that doesn't mean that it isn't as intense, crushing, or controversial as it was when it was first released.    Reign In Blood upon released was hailed as the heaviest album of all time by Kerrang! Magazine and it definitely deserves that honor. It is brutal from start to finish and it never lets up for a second in it's incredibly short, yet effective 29 minutes.    If you are a fan of metal or music in general, you owe it to yourself to listen to this album.
0452289963|5.0|Having Oprah Winfrey say, \\"Your book is my book club pick\\" epitomizes a leap in success. It's certainly the dream of almost every author I know. For one Canadian author it's a dream come true. Vancouver-based author and spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle must feel like he's riding a wave. His book [[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]] is Oprah's 61st choice for her book club. Oprah is hugely responsible for Tolle's earlier rise in fame as she launched his 2005 book The Power of Now, skyrocketing it to a million-copy bestseller.<br /><br />Tolle's [[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]] is a fantastic book for anyone who is looking for some illumination on life. Many of us want to change, yearn to better ourselves or grow to our fullest potential, yet we have no idea HOW to to do this, how to find our life's purpose. We are living on 'ego', surrounded by stuff and are unconnected to who we really are inside.<br /><br />If you are a reader who really thinks about what you're reading, you'll find some clarity and direction in this book. I found it to be very uplifting, hopeful, thought-provoking and reaffirming. I think any book that can affect a person's thoughts or life as Eckhart's books have done deserves to be read with an open mind and heart. As in [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]], I found many similarities in the messages in this book and I wish I'd read it years ago. Tolle's writing is quietly blunt and often lyrical, and always honest, as he sees life.<br /><br />I recommend this book for older teens, especially those graduating and moving into the work force. It is also great for any adult, especially those looking to make changes in their lives, whether in relationships or careers. In many ways, I found it to be a philosophical study of how to 'let go' of old ways of thinking. This is a book about making every minute of your life count for something--being authentic, which reminds me also of Sarah Ban Breathnack's [[ASIN:B00008RWC7 Something More: Excavating Your Authentic Self]].<br /><br />I am also pleased to see that Oprah has selected another Canadian author. As a Canadian novelist myself, this brings me some hope. After all, I've discovered that one of my life's purposes is to write novels that make people think.<br /><br />What's your life's purpose?<br /><br />~Cheryl Kaye Tardif,<br />Author of Divine Intervention, which reminds me also of Sarah Ban Breathnack's [[ASIN:B00008RWC7 Something More: Excavating Your Authentic Self]].    I am also pleased to see that Oprah has selected another Canadian author. As a Canadian novelist myself, this brings me some hope.

B0001906O0|4.0|[[ASIN:B0001906O0 Join the Dots: B-Sides & Rarities, 1978-2001]]<br /><br />The Cure's B-Sides and Rarities will definitely be a cherished box set for die hard Cure fans.  However, if you aren't familiar with Robert Smith and his quirky, lovable dramatic self, in listening to this four cd box set, you will experience a beautiful journey into the amazing multi-faceted side of Smith's brilliant psyche.<br /><br />The box set comes with a four cd compilation accompanied with a colorful and beautifully designed book that reads the history of the last 20 years of music in which The Cure has created.  In listening to the compilation, you will travel with the band from their early, visceral hard hitting punk inspired days, to the beautiful tapestry of love songs and introspective lyrics prolifically written by Robert Smith.<br /><br />The first cd punches in with the b-side of \\"Killing An Arab\\", 10:15 Saturday Night, and makes you laugh at the fast paced Rockabilly inspired \\"Pill Box Tales\\".  If you haven't heard the early Cure's dynamic punk, even at a young age, vividly executed, I highly recommend it.  You will notice the influence of Bowie, Hendrix, and the pre-punk 60s juxtaposed with the clean, ethereal sound that remains a theme throughout the band's history, drawing you into the darkest period of the band's musical caravan. The  b-sides of the album<br />\\"Disintegration\\", the climax to following albums \\"Faith\\" and \\"Pornography brings the somber B-side to \\"The Walk\\" which is entitled \\"Just One Kiss\\", and contrary to this, the b-side of \\"The Lovecats\\" entitled \\"Speak My Language which is a jazzy, light hearted number.<br /><br />The 2nd cd brings you to the years of albums such as \\"Galore\\" and \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\".  The Dizzy Mix<br />of \\"Just Like Heaven\\" is a stripped down version of the flawless single.  And Smith does three renditions of \\"Hello, I Love You\\" by The Doors.  The b-side of \\"Just Like Heaven\\" is \\"Snow in Summer\\", yet another heart felt love song that, as most of these b-sides, was an intentional match for the released single.<br /><br />Venturing into the greater 'poppy' years of the band's work, the third cd will give you  b-sides from the album \\"Wish\\" and \\"Wild Mood Swing such as the beautiful love song b-side to the single \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" entitled \\"Halo\\" and \\"Ocean\\", a soft introspective love song that is the b-side to the swanky single \\"The 13th\\". In this, Smith's subtle humor is apparent, revealing that his dark side isn't the only impetus behind his music.<br /><br />Cd four there is a delightful and reflective b-side to the \\"Ambient Mix-B-Side of Gone! and Strange Attraction\\" entitled \\"This Is A Lie\\" which is a favorite of mine.  Fans will definitely enjoy \\"The Oakenfield Mix\\" of  the melancholy \\"Out Of This World\\" which was never released.  This cd also has the acoustic mix of the head nodding \\"Maybe Someday\\" which derives from the 2000 album release \\"Bloodflowers\\".<br /><br />If you are a die-hard Cure fan, this will be a delightful addition to your collection, and something that will be listened to frequently as well as a beautiful coffee table display.  To the ones that know Robert Smith as the goth, gloom and doom king, it will give you a fresh perspective on the complex artist and his articulately written gift of intellect and music that he brings to the table.  This will definitely be a regular play list on my own ipod.an intentional match for the released single.

0743496736|5.0|I have always been a fan of Jodi Picoult. And while some of her books naturally are better than others,all of her books are very worthwhile reading.This novel should be engrossing to anyone who has teenagers, or wait-was a teenager. Yes, it's a hard read at times; because these are hard times when these things are happening at school and college campuses everywhere. None of us or ours are immune; and that's the scary part. Ms Picoult writes wonderfully, and doesn't pull punches. Maybe it will help some to learn that teaching their kids compassion is as important as being best on the team, at math, etc.
B0000029DD|5.0|If there were to be a story or play written about Jeff Buckley, it would be a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions.     The life and death of a young man who was clearly talented and ahead of his time has left a mark on the music world, as for generations will listen to his music and only seldom grasp the true beauty and message of his work.    Some Wiki-facts:   Grace is the first and only complete studio album by Jeff Buckley, despite having initially had poor sales in the US, it received wide critical acclaim. Since Buckley's death in 1997, the album appears to gain more fans each year and has now sold over 2 million copies worldwide. An extended version of the album was released in 2004, subtitled Legacy Edition, which peaked at #44 in the UK. It celebrates the album's tenth anniversary.    If you aren't a fan of Buckley and are into soulful blues rock, I would suggest checking this out. No review I could write would justify the songs on this album. However, if you would care to give it a listen, these are my favorite tracks; \\"grace\\" \\"lilacs\\" \\"last goodbye\\" \\"hallelujah\\" \\"dream brother\\" and \\"so real\\"    5 stars. 31 years too young to leave us with so much musical potential.

B000000WA4|5.0|Billy Corgan is interesting to me, he seems like a musician well developed and innovative in his own sub genre of harder rock. And yet for some reason anything released by Smashing Pumpkins after this album was average, if that at best.     Sad to say, this is the last classic Smashing Pumpkins album. Whether they tried to develop their sound with Nuevo-drum machines/ sounds in [[ASIN:B000006NPY Adore]] or loud and noisy industrial sounds of [[ASIN:B000042OI4 MACHINA/The Machines of God]], nothing has worked for them, and their latest album [[ASIN:B000OQF6N6 Zeitgeist]] is the pinnacle of crap. Stupid, pointless and thus ruining the Smashing Pumpkins name forever. He may as well have put this album under the Zwan title, it was so unworthy of SP recognition.     All things aside, this review is about Mellon Collie. I remember getting this album and thinking that it was insane that SP would release a double CD, my first introduction to the band was through [[ASIN:B000000WJZ Siamese Dream]], which I followed closely to with [[ASIN:B000000W6F Gish]] and [[ASIN:B000000W6R Pisces Iscariot]]and never chose to pay much attention to them, until I gave this album a listen. And now SP are one of my favourite bands of all time.    Raw, Gentle, Hard, Soft, all within the same album. I remember as a teenager listening to this how I would just have both CD's on rotation with Soundgarden's Superunknown. And listen to it all night. All the time.     I used to only appreciate the first CD, but at the same time, learnt to appreciate the second CD as the opposite, but complimenting side to this album. I don't think there are that many albums I could listen to over and over, but this has to be one of them. Without a doubt. I will make my kids listen to this double CD one day as an example of the crazy stuff their dad listened to in their day, only to dream that they may feel a little bit of what I did when I first listened to this album.    Never again will their be an album like this,I believe if there is a point you want to hail as Smashing Pumpkins best work, you don't need to look further then this. It's a shame that despite all things, billy corgan will not look to reconciling with James Iha and D'arcy.
B000784WMW|4.0|I love, love, LOVE this version of \\"JANE EYRE\\". I have had the VHS version for years. So, with all the versions done in between, I was concerned that \\"they\\" might never get around to putting it on to DVD. I was most pleased that they did. However, I strongly dislike the format that they have used in breaking it up with each episode being totally separate. They run credits before and after each episode as it was originally shown on PBS [here in the USA]. This is quite annoying to me, and I can find no good reason to have put it on this way. The only thing that occurs to me is that it was easier for someone to transfer it on to the disc. It is wonderful to have the entire version as it was originally produced. It tells the whole book better than any of the other productions. This DVD restores all the parts that were 'cut' from the VHS four hour copy, and we now have at least 5 hours of it (it seems like more). I like this. But I do strongly feel that it would be improved if it were to take out the episodic beginnings and endings and run it straight through. As watchers, we can always stop the DVD if we need to and then come back to it, without it being broken up.
B000002HFU|4.0|This album, apart from its nostalgic value that it holds with many fans of the early 90's NYC-come-east-coast-hip-hop sound is a pure classic thrown on the scene from the wu dynasty.    lyrically, the playful, carefree and crude ODB slices it up on his first album, serving an array of harsh, honest lyrics with almost a battle theme to them, and yet at the same time maintaining the essential crude raw style that defined him. If he was to play a character in a old school kung fu movie, he would be the drunken, self indulgent and womanising master, seemingly harmless unless provoked.     production on this album was, naturally, done by the RZA. Providing the similar eery and melodic beats of previous solo wu work, with samples ranging from Kung Fu Movies to old jazz and blues records.    The guest appearences are of a stellar selection: Method Man, Raekwon, Killa Priest, Masta Killa, Zu Keeper, Buddha Monk and Prodigal Sunn, making this album an all star cast and representing brooklyn on the grandest of scales.    make no mistake, \\"Return of the 36 Chambers\\" is an all time wu tang classic, in the tradition of [[ASIN:B000002WPI Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]],[[ASIN:B000000OUJ Liquid Swords]],[[ASIN:B000002WU9 Only Built 4 Cuban Linx]] and [[ASIN:B0000024JA Tical]]
B00003JRCQ|5.0|PBS is currently doing a series of Jane Austen's works that are mostly remakes. They have not yet come to \\"PERSUASION\\". But I think that this production is so very good, I can not imagine a better one. The actors are perfectly chosen and played. Amanda Root, as our heroine, Anne, is the only adult child to have taken after her deceased  mother, and the other two sisters are Austen's 'fluff'. Their father, played by Corin Redgrave, is a thoughtless fop. Ciaran Hinds [most recently seen as Julius Caesar in HBO's \\"ROME\\"] plays the young and handsome naval Capt. Wentworth, as the object of Anne's affection, which she believes to be lost forever. These two leading actors are without peer. Their subtlety and the simple looks that occur are so touching and sweet. I had seen this production at least three times on television, so was excited to have my own copy. It is all put into only 104 minutes of watching time. Besides reading the book itself, this movie is a treasure well worth having.

Jim Carrey is very good as the meek Joel.  Kate Winslet is also good as the scattered Clementine.<br /><br />This movie should be watched every year on February 14th.
B0000214F0|1.0|Another waste of money! As porno this is an uninspired piece of crap.In my opinion, it doesn't even qualify as \\"erotica\\". As a period piece it is equally a failure. It lends nothing to history, the Roman Empire or even the story of the Emperor Caligula. I can't say if this is the worst movie Roddy McDowell ever made, but it must be close! Considering how highly it was hyped originally, I was VERY disappointed. This movie is definitely not for kids, less because of the nudity and twisted sexuality as because it's just a bad movie. Plot is limp and the cinematography is barely above amateur status.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Compared to his former co-band members in the Beatles, George Harrisons solo output may be considered the most uniform. Not one to wildly diverge as far as styles and soundscapes go, his albums were written either because he felt like writing or because he had to write. As much as we love George to this day, the fact of the matter is, that this was a solo career headed for the dumps. A few prolonged projects in the mid 70's ate away his recording time, and when he returned, the record buying public were looking elsewhere. George was less impressed with the workings and demands of record companies, and even less impressed with the musical tastes of the late 70's. After delivering a fine album (33 1/3) to his new record company, he would go on to watch sales drop, the record company moan and the World losing interest. So, George did other things that interested him. Started paying more attention to downtime, racing, movies, producing movies and so on.<br /><br />But then, after a couple of years had passed, he returned with this self titled album. And what a return it was. Regardless of the record buying publics reaction to this album, it's a real gem. George sounds so at ease, and in such a pleasant mood here, it radiates positivity through the speakers. Here is a man who has found love, and who seems to have enjoyed himself these past years.

Somewhere in England was recorded mostly before the death of John Lennon, but will forever be remembered as a post Lennon album. By the time of Gone Troppo, George had lost interest in such a degree, it ruined any hope the listener had of hearing a great George Harrison album again. Of course, he would return in a commanding way with 9th Cloud, but in 1979, these events could not be guessed. As it is, George Harrison, the album, bookends a decade that began in such a splendid manner, on the ruins of the Beatles, with the monumental 'All Things Must Pass', and it bookends it splendidly.th 9th Cloud, but in 1979, these events could not be guessed.

B0009MAO46|5.0|Yes this is basically a kids film, but as a 40+ person with no kids who has purchased the DVD, I'll happily own up to being an adult who loves this film.<br /><br />This film set the benchmark for computer animated films when it was released in 1995 and it still looks good today. The story is simple and the characters are marvellous. Whoever thought of the idea that Buzz Lightyear could be a toy who believes he really is a Space Ranger deserved an Oscar. Its a brilliantly conceived idea, which has a funny and at times touching script.<br /><br />Its also worth mentioning the that the songs are by Randy Newman, a vastly underrated musician and songwriter, whose Uncles wrote the music for some the great Hollywood movies of the 40's and 50's.<br /><br />The extras on the two disc edition are pretty good, but its the main film you're buying it for. In my opinion Toy Story 2 is even better than this one - 6 stars for that one perhaps?

1400079276|5.0|Haruki Murakami's masterpiece of multiple forms is difficult to pin-down, even for the basic Amazon review. Supposedly taken from the title of a famous pop-song by a fictional one-hit wonder, Kafka on the Shore is hypnotic in its prose, gripping in its depth and as lucid in its intrigue as any platinum selling piece of music could ever be, or promise.<br /><br />But maybe that's what Murakami was suggesting on a few levels ... the power of music, the power of a dream or the power of a strong metaphor. Either way, he succeeds here, and does so with such a deft and trusting hand, that you can't help but not feel confronted by your own trust that you've put forward as a reader with every turn of the page. Rarely does an author give so much to a piece of work as Murakami does with the vagabond tale of young Kafka and the dutiful speaking cats.<br /><br />Kafka on the shore is the book that everyone wants to write, it is the book that everyone wishes they had the ability to write. It's the book that modern civilization has been building up for, or at least it was when it was written. Taking the suggestion of the author and re-reading it several times, I find it to be just as compelling now as it was the first time I experienced it. And experienced is probably the best word. It's made of the stuff that built the pyramids, or the statues on Easter Island or the insight (or madness - take your pick) needed to paint [[ASIN:B000G6WGGO The Starry Night]] or craft [[ASIN:B000002RMM Beethoven's Archduke trio]].<br /><br />Murakami continually shakes off his detractors like a sleeping hobo, shakes off the pesky fleas in the cold of night, only to wake the next morning and commit himself to the impossible with vigor, proving the world is not right and something really does not look well upon the face of our beloved Colonel Sanders as retort.<br /><br />With such a loyal fan base these days, Murakami wins the pennant - where other writers, like [[ASIN:0671732498 Carlos Castaneda]], have failed to convince you that the world that they're describing is both real and tangible, no matter how many cracks they may take at it. Haruki Murakami hits home runs every time.that the world that they're describing is both real and tangible, no matter how many cracks they may take at it. Haruki Murakami hits home runs every time.
B00065U08Q|4.0|If you asked John's fans 12 years ago that he would be making an electronica album in the future, they would probably burst out laughing.  As he was not even in a fit state to play the guitar never mind venture into territories you wouldn't associate with Frusciante back then.  But times have changed and `Sphere' sees Frusciante and Klinghoffer make a successful venture into the world of electronica. This is the fifth album out of the six albums Frusciante released in 6 months on the Record Collection label, and his 9th overall.  I would say this is the most challenging and experimental album Frusciante has ever produced.  Using a range of different instruments from synthesizers to string ensembles, making the complexity achieved stand out amongst his other albums. With 7 tracks it is difficult to know whether this classifies as a full length album or an EP.  It certainly does not have EP in the title which seems to be customary for EP's.  Furthermore at just over 38 minutes it certainly looks as if it is long enough to classify as a full length album.    The album has a good flow to it.  Starting off with `Sphere', and then turning it up with the funked up `Afterglow'. The pair then take it to the next level with `Walls' which at points is just insane, as its just feels they are out of control creating a frenzied wall of sound .  Due to the sheer intensity of `Walls' it is as if their energy levels are gradually decreasing through the rest of the songs, as they gradually get slower and slower because John and Josh used all their energy up all in this track. By the time the last track comes around it feels like its crawling along at snails pace with album closer `My life'.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, in fact quite the opposite.  It works really well, and even though `My life' comes in at 1 minute 23 seconds; by that time it's like they have nothing more to give. Even the vocals have slowed right down when John sings \\"Life was never what you thought\\".  It isan appropriate pace, which makes the listener hone in on the deep and meaningful lyrics.    The experimentation and the sounds the various sounds achieved by Josh and John on this album are a testament to how they are always looking to keep things fresh and to keep pushing the boundaries of their music.  A fine example of this is in `Communique' which sounds like wind channelling through a small passage, accomplishing a kind of whooshing effect which adds an air of eeriness to the track.  Likewise `At your Enemies' has some nice effects through it, like the echo effect used on the synthesiser.  Combined with Josh's vocals, this is yet another great chilled out track, but at the same time has that ghostly feel to it like `Communique'.      The album is unique in the sense that is the only Frusciante to release which is credited to not only John Frusciante, but Josh Klinghoffer as well.  It does surprise me a bit because Klinghoffer has appeared on at least 5 albums by John, and while he does get credited in the sleeve notes, this is the first album that the artist is `John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer'.  It could be that this is the first time where it was felt that Josh contributed to the song writing, production etc in an equal proportion to the Frusciante.  Maybe it was Josh who didn't want to be accredited in the artist title because compared to Frusciante, as he is a lot lesser known than Frusciante and it would be more like `Frusciante and who?'.  Who knows, but one things for sure, like Ataxia, Josh's vocals add so much to tracks like `Surrogate people'. This track in particular, I think is the best vocal combination song they have done.  The two of their vocals combined just works so well.      Overall this is a really good album.  I would say out of all the albums he has done, it is the one requires the most patient in order to fully appreciate it.  It's album which stands out as John's most adventurous, which is saying a lot considering some of the experimentation on his other albums.  So much so, that although I've listened to this album a lot, I still think I need to listen to it more, as I think there are more layers I still haven't unearthed.  This though, is where the real beauty of the album lies.

B000EOTAM6|1.0|Stay away, run, as far away as you can from this stinker of a movie.  Nonsensical plot, horrible acting, cheesy special effects....  Charlize Theron for all her beauty doesn't move with the natural buff athleticism of someone like Kate Beckinsale or Milla Jovovich; she looks wooden and unconvincing as a super-heroine...
B000OHZL1W|4.0|...well...back in the early 90's, this movie was one of my favorite. Time passed and since all dvd were low quality, I didn't get a chance to see this movie since then.   As for the hd dvd , let me say that from today's point of view, the movie has lost a bit of interest since the edge technologie used in sneakers looks a bit outdated today. This point apart, the movie is still fun and the quality is excellent. The image is extremely clear even in the dark scenes. Sound is good average. If, like me, this movie sounds a ring, it's certainly worth the buy...otherwise, it's for redford's fan only.

0743298039|5.0|I didn't know much about this book except for the summary on amazon and I bought it on audio cd.  The reader for this book was perfect!  A sophisticated english accent that adjusted to every character wonderfully.  The story is amazing.  It's a richly told tale of sad moments, intrigue, love, suspense, and surprising twists.  The ending won't disappoint you however don't expect characters you might connect with during the story to all have their great endings throughout the tale, this is a story of hardships and overcoming them.  The writing of this story shows that Diane Setterfield is an excellent writer with intelligence and a great imagination for storytelling.  I can't wait to read her next book, when I had finished this book I felt bad that it was over because I looked forward to listening to it and that rarely happens for me.

The colorful Venecian background and Baroque music made the movie light and diverting.  Although it didn't have the power of \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" it was lovely nonetheless.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The last reviewer stole my thunder somewhat.  The previous two Tool records had songs on them that I really didn't discover until a year or so later. '10,000 Days' is a little different as  I got into the songs immediately and haven't got sick of them yet.  What makes this my favorite Tool record is that there more songs  which I like as compared to the three of four on 'Aenima' & 'Lateralus'.  Standouts tracks are 'Vicarious' and 'Rosetta Stoned'

0446698326|5.0|This book will bring tears to your eyes and fill your heart with the warm sensation of love.  In the beginning, John (the narrator) tells you how it ends, but you still hope that when the end comes, it will be different!  Once again, Nicholas Sparks gives you a romantic and tear-jerking love story.  It is about a soldier falling in love with the girl-next-door type of girl and their fight to stay together while he is away.  It will make you grab a tissue!  I would definitely recommend this book, especially to Sparks (A Walk to Remember, The Notebook) fans.
0618680004|5.0|Mr.Dawkins has written the bible of non-believers and gives ample examples of faith busting scenarios.He systematically takes apart in a scientific way much of religious belief,shows the Bible for what it truly is and demonstrates what religion and its byproducts have done over history,currently, and how it has 'improved' the world.Enlightened people see the truth in what he says,yet religion lives on.Some say it is going to destroy what we know to be good and stable.Despite the truth of scientific advances and facts there are those who continue to ignore the facts and press on.Religious belief is a touchy subject and it is what is causing much of the turmoil in the world today. Historically it has been the cause of more suffering than was needed but on it goes.First Catholicism had its heyday, Now the Muslims want their fair share of domination.Are we better for it? No, I think not.This book is recommended for those who seek to be freethinkers.Those who wish to shed their religious skin and be rid of religious oppression. Some say god is dead.How can god die if there is no god.The views are opposing and will always be.This book will help you decide for yourself.Read it to open your minds to the possibilities,doubts will be clarified,food for thought will be nourished.Perhaps all your fears will be neutralized.Dawkins has given me new direction and maybe he will give you the same.Read the book for yourself and decide. Agnostics aren't all bad we just need more than blind faith and mysteries to give of ourselves.Maybe,just maybe a world without religion would be better off.I think so and tend to agree with Mr.Dawkins et al.The weak will always need a god and therein lies the rub.Ultimately, the decision is yours and yours alone to make.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|I am nearly 14 years old and i've had my share of nerf wars, and trust me, only use the longshot when you have somewhere to duck behind to reload, or have a full clip. The best case scenario for reloading is having a full clip ready to pop in. But when you're not that lucky, you have to load up the clip (which takes awhile,) and then pop it in. That is where it is worse than the firefly, and maverick. It does shoot streamline darts pretty far (over the advertised 30 ft.) but those are the only darts it uses, and the streamline hurt even more in the maverick. The gun also jams a lot. You'll be shooting, you'll reload, push up the bolt, but then it won't click in. Eventually you realize there is already a dart stuck in there somehow. Luckily, NERF addressed this problem and put in a jam door under the tactical rail(handle). But the darts get pretty beat, and it's hard to find refills for the list price. The \\"scope' is pretty pathetic, so you should just take that off because if somthings lined up perfectly in it, the dart's bound to go a foot below. The pistol extension is good for sniping, as is the fold-down bipod, but gets in the way otherwise. It is cool to shoot two darts at once, though.  Now, finally the good things. This gun is probably the easiest to keep firing within a clip of the ones i've used (i have yet to try the recon cs-6), and is the most accurate. Or, you could hold it like a shotgun and just fire away. And because it is very big (too big with the extension) it is good to shield yourself with. And if you don't have a clip ready, you can slide the dart down the barrel and then cock the gun, although it isn't recommended. So this is a great gun, but i'm not sure if i'd suggest this over the firefly.
B000QXDED6|3.0|300 is an awesome action movie but the Special Features on this disc are very disappointing. The 'Making Of' Featurette is only 5 minutes long. The 'Making 300 in Images' was just a bunch of film pieced together at a high speed. It relayed no actual information and made my eyes hurt.     Buy the movie, but don't expect much from the 2nd disc.
B00005JPUN|3.0|This is the 3rd remake of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" (or 4th)? Its a great story, but the directors do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING with it. To make things worse, there are alot of good actors in this movie but every scene is done in a predictable manner, by-the-numbers.    This movie is not bad, its simply not much of anything. I recommend buying one of the earlier Invasion of the Body Snatcher re-makes rather than \\"Invasion\\".
B00005JPNY|2.0|I just want to something off the bat:  this is NOT the golden compass story you will find the book.  it is a pretty, highly flashy, children´s fairy tale based on a truly inspiring story that the church hates to this day.  but i am not going to mention the church in this review, something completely backwards to a few years ago when the book came out; you wouldn´t have seen any review without this crucial theological comparation.  no, because the movie has refused to add this element and, as the director states, will continue into the next movies (i only wonder in horror how those will be protrayed).      the characters, as others have mentioned, are a feeble outline of their true form.  i am not knocking the actor´s skills.  no, i think they were actually perfect choices, included the young girl who played Lyra.  i have a series problem with the script.      EVERYTHING is different.  i am not just meaning that some thought-provoking conversations were omitted (there were, but that is to be excepted).  i am refering to the complete jig-saw puzzle of the order of events.  it seems that they took the three major events in the north and just mixed them up in an illogical order.      (spoiler)  for example: after the gypsies are attacked Lyra is brought (in the book) to the station Bolvanger because, logically, kids are valued there for experimental purposes and the hunters are paid in return.  However in the movie they bring her to the polar bears (for no reason that is explained), an event which Iroek just happens to the know exactly where she is and starts running there without the help of the gypies.    another major flaw of the movie is the lack of desperation in the characters.  in the book we see Lyra not only evolve, but express clear destress befitting a child in her position.  However in the movie she just kinda floats through the different events.  Also some scenes that i felt added to the danger level where omitted, like the finding of the separated daemons and the party at Miss Coulter´s house.  These darker elements are completely wiped from the movie.    yes, one must admit that the special effects were stunning, and they did capture the style of Lyra´s world.  But that doesn´t lessen the blow of watching a movie that can´t in any respect hold a candle to the books.  even though one must except different elements, this movie is pretty disappointing nevertheless. too much was omitted with not enough added.     i only recommed this movie to people who haven´t read the book and even then not without much gusto.  ironically as always, this movie, as the book, does stick to the tradition of having a controversally existence.  the church still hate the book and thus still hate the movie due to the anti-theology message found in the books.  the fans of the book still love the book and thus still hate the movie due to the obvious plot holes and lack of real content.

This movie brings back (steals) such famed theatrical releases such as: Lord of the Rings, Star Wars & Decency. Sorry to be short on the whole thing but I guess that just the way it is. I am really tired and have no patience regarding this... (can't even call it a movie). I still have yet to read the book. I trully hope that it is something worthwhile.

B00005K3OT|5.0|Our suburban Presbyterian church used the video CHOCOLAT together with Hillary Brand's book CHOCOLATE FOR LENT in church-wide small adult group classes for six weeks.  It was a great study in love and acceptance as portrayed by the main character in the video.  As a professed non-religious person, Vianne showed many of Jesus' values so clearly depicted by his actions and parables.  Her non-critical acceptance of Armande and Josephine had much in common with Jesus' acceptance of Levi the tax collector (Luke 5:27-32) and the prostitute who washed his feet with her tears (Luke 7:36-50).  CHOCOLAT is a complex, multiple-subplot story very well done.  No wonder it won five Academy Award Nominations.
1591841666|2.0|I have to give it to Seth Godin for being an engaging writer. He knows how to write and keep your interest high. It's a very thin book however--I finished the book before realizing I had been planning to scan it to decide whether to buy the book or not.     The book itself can be summarized into a few points:     (1) The world is disproportionately nicer to #1 (the very best gets a lot, lot more than the rest), therefore     (2) If you're serious at something you should try your best to be #1, but    (3) In your journey, there will be a Dip along the way. This Dip separates the quitters from the winners. It's the stage along a curve where the initial rapid progress that you have seems to suddenly plateau or even regress. By realizing this, you can    (4) either persist to overcome The Dip, or quit if you think it's not worth it/you can't be at the top. If you can't be #1, might as well quit and look for something for which you have a talent. Also, it's possible that    (5) it may not be The Dip at all but a Dead End, in which no matter how hard you try it's still, er, a Dead End. In which case you should get the heck outta there as fast as possible.     Now the problem with this book, is that it doesn't really give you a framework to decide whether you should quit or stick. And whether you should quit because it's a Dead-End or because it's a Dip but you know it's not worth it.     To be fair to the author, usually we only realize this kind of thing after the fact. Not to mention it's really subjective (you may want to persevere even if you have no world-class talent simply because you like it, for instance). So the book gets 2 stars from me.

Maybe one day Universal Studio's will make up it's mind and have it manufactured and released on Blu-Ray.    Then I will buy.      I am no supporter at all of HD-DVD as I believe Toshiba's top management has made a very serious blunder as a Japanese company not to liaise and coordinate priorhand with another major Japanese company called Sony.   What an error !  Talking about royalties and stupidity confusing the consumers. Toshiba : NO !

0143038583|5.0|Pollan makes what could be a very dry, semi-technical subject come to life and amuse, inform, and possibly influence the eating habits of the reader.  Seldom does an author achieve such a level of competence.  In my opinion, it's a book that everyone would benefit from reading.  It was somewhat of an eye opener to read about processed foods, and how far we've come (or sunk)in  changing the natural food chain into a processing chain.  There are many such points made in the book, such as exposing the phoneyness of the organic, range free, etc. marketers.  Having been raised on a farm, though, I was amused at times reading about a city guy's view of farming and ranching.  At  other times I thought that the author was a bit naive about the many unknowns and pitfalls of farming, or perhaps he just didn't mention them.  The book is definitely a \\"should read.\\"

0375424474|5.0|It's a short book organized like a smorgasbord: the author jumps around in the history of life and in his own history.  That's the unique flavor of this book, relating his field and lab experiences to the reader as he develops the big picture of evolution.  He has a punchy style that doesn't seem to pander to the reader.  He communicates his enthusiasm and has a wonderful ability to condense information and yet keep it intelligible.  The section on how difficult field work is, and how one can prepare but not be sure of what is going to happen was enthralling.  So, I guess I liked the first half better because of the field experiences.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|***1/2 2005. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Numerous good actors for this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels. It's a lot more violent than BATMAN even if Basin City looks a lot like Gotham City. Recommended.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|\\"The Good Shepard\\" is a slow paced film that really surprised me because its countless images filled of semiotic profile. It's about a devoted functionary of the CIA in those hard times from the first days of the WW2 until the not so well reminded and frustrated invasion of the marines in Cuba.<br /><br />The use of greyish lights (Please remember Sidney Lumet's The verdict)  is transcendental around practically every single frame of the movie, the faces are involved into a diffuse atmosphere, as the truth they keep is. On the other hand we will assist to the progressive and unstoppable crumbling of the marriage of this efficient agent, who sees what's going on around his personal life, and is incapable to make nothing to avoid it.<br /><br />William Hurt, Angelina Jolie, John Tuturro and Matt Damon are stunning every one of them, from their perspectives, make of this personal film of Robert de Niro appears as one of the most intriguing and devastating films in years around the times in which the C.I.A. was best known as the O.S.S.<br /><br />One of the top films of the year.

First they pull on the heart-strings and feelings of nostalgia by using Marlon Brando's voice overs and the original John Williams theme. Unfortunately, they then inflict on us a plot with holes and hire good actors but give them horrible dialogue and scenarios to work with. Stitching it together with CGI doesn't make it good.    There's no uplifting feeling at the end of the movie. Such films and heros should pull us out of ourselves and remind us of what we should strive for and can try to achieve. Otherwise, what's the point?     This movie is not what Superman is about. Pick up the comic books or re-watch Christopher Reeves first Superman film, you'll be better off. And for those of you who want \\"realism\\" there's plenty of pain and strife and struggle in the comics, without resorting to what this film did.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an outstanding documentary that should be the cornerstone of any Blu-Ray disc collection. The content and photography reflect the filmaker and crew's dedication to creating a product for the ages that truly shines.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|I waited the whole movie for the scene in the trailer, where Denzel executes someone and drops the gun as in \\"The Godfather\\". It wasn't there. We've seen the story before, and better done. A walk thru for talented people.
0736063684|5.0|This is one of the best weight training guides that I've found.  The art illustrations are beautiful and very educational and it is an excellent technique guide as well.  I refer to it several times a week for tips and ideas about my workouts.  There is a significant amount of detailed information that will help weight lifters and fitness buffs no matter their skill or fitness goals.  I highly recommend it for technique, variety and injury avoidance.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|It's so far-fetched and illogical that it's ridiculous. I can never believe what the movie showed me. It depicted that the Cruise, the professional assasin could not kill Jamie the taxi driver!     At  the end, the dialogue was so childish that it's unbearable! Cruise said to Jamie \\"I was just trying to make a living!\\" before trying to kill Jamie. But it turned out Cruise was killed by Jamie! On top of that, there's no suspense at all.    No wonder it's a big flop at the box office. This is one of the worst movies starring Tom Cruise. Save your money on this one.
B000FA57N0|5.0|The finale of Joss Whedon's brilliant Firefly tv show story, this was the reason I bought an HD DVD player. Tragically the effort is a last breath for all the under-dog's involved; the Firefly crew, the Serenity \\"Browncoat\\" fans, and now the HD-DVD format.    Action packed, it's an outside the box take on the relationships forged through trials in the wild west of space travel 500 years in the future. The HD action and computer graphics of the heros overcoming impossible odds make it worth the money, even though HD-DVD extinction seems near.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|It's more like a psychological drama. It's definitely not a horror movie. It deals with religous faith, science and something that science can't explain. The acting is Ok. One of another good thing is it's based on a true story.<br /><br />It's worth viewing.
B001041JLE|5.0|Pop music would not be what it is today if it were not for this album!!!  'Thriller' has stood the test of time!

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This DVD was so magnificent.  Everything about the whole production was wonderful.  It's a must see.  So worth owning because you'll want to watch it again and again.  Get the C.D. of the music for your car too.  You'll be glad you did.  Such talent and visuals.  Trust me, buy it.  thanks.

B000EUDAWG|4.0|Alright, as a prankster, I love the idea of a remote control spider.  I purchased this model for myself about a week back and, as with most mechanical purchases, discovered it has both its pros and cons.<br /><br />Cons: First off, I wish it were a bit smaller as to be of a more realistic size.  Second, it makes a loud mechanical sound, so in order to gag someone, the atmosphere must be set just right.  Third, the eyes flash red... and really brightly.  What I did to remedy this, was to use a permanent marker to darken the plastic eyes.  Fourth, it only functions properly on smooth surfaces.  And lastly, it is fragile.  Beware of scaring spider-squashers and bold pets!  Also, if given to a young child, it may be broken within a week.<br /><br />Pros: Fun, fun, fun.  While visiting my mom's, I managed to gag her and a brother (others to come).  Although it's oversized and noisy, the visual association one makes upon first seeing it is very effective (don't plan on sneaking up on someone from across the room with it though, for the noise will give it away).  Great prank, reasonable price.  When I gagged my mom, I caught the scare on tape (her scream atleast; the camera needed to be a bit higher in order to capture her face).  You can find that video clip on Youtube if you conduct a search using the keywords \\"scream remote control tarantula prank.\\"  Also, others have placed videos there of this spider in action.<br /><br />Happy pranking!
1593080255|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.<br /><br />Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.<br /><br />Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"<br /><br />Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\"uld not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"     Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\"
B00005JPAO|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to others.  Price was great and free shipping made it even better.  Watch it twice and it's paid for itself.
B0011Z32PS|5.0|I listened to this while pregnant with my first child all the time. I had a long commute, and there weren't any bathroom stops along the busy interstate I drove on. I had to be in the car for at least an hour, with a good 20-30 minutes after parking until I could find a restroom. Hence, no soda, coffee, etc. (I was also paranoid - this was my first baby, after all) Turns out the fetus loved the music too, and even at the age of 5, all I have to do is put this album on and he relaxes and dances, and sings along. Yup, I turned my child into a lover of heavy metal. Even as an infant, he'd relax and wriggle happily to Metallica's black album. hee hee hee.
0810993139|5.0|My son read this book in record time. He kept showing me the different pages to share with me how funny he thought it was. He told his best friend who ran out and got the book to read it too. No sooner did he finish it when we saw the part two version in the bookstore. He has already read that one too non-stop. I highy recommend it for young boys 7-9 years old.
B000VSYDRM|1.0|I didn't read the book. But if it's as ridiculous as the movie, I don't plan to. While it's definitely a big budget production--the costumes and sets are gorgeous--I can't say I'd recommend it unless you've seen everything else Amazon has to offer.
B0000057C5|5.0|i had this cd before but i just got it again and i love it.I love all of rammstein's music.For starters the song \\" du hast\\" in english does mean \\"you have\\".No matter what anyone else says if said different.The song \\"spiel mit mir\\" means \\"play with me\\".
B0000VCZKM|3.0|\\"It's not as cool as it looks on the front cover.  The scariest part is the end.  And it was very scary when the Russian dude threw the bomb.  I loved 'You're Never Fully Dressed without a Smile.'  And with Aileen Quinn and the little dog Sandy I just loved it.  But what I didn't like was the sexual parts.  One where Miss Hannigan is trying to push Mr. Bundles into his cart and do something to him, and also she tried to push Daddy Warbucks into her bedroom.  And here's something that I liked about it.  They had a famous comedienne in it which was Carol Burnett.  But why didnt' they have 'NYC'?\\"    Her mom adds:  If you're purchasing an Annie DVD for a child, the 1999 Disney version is the better bet.  While I never saw the original Broadway version so I don't know how Miss Hannigan was played, Carol Burnett plays her as completely in the sauce the entire time -- something Carol Burnett has always done very well but probably not appropriate for children.  This version also has some sexual elements (again mostly involving Miss Hannigan) and there are the scary elements that my daughter mentioned.  On the plus side, Aileen Quinn does a nice job as Annie.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|My brother told me that I had to see this movie because I am a Beatles fan and that this movie was full of Beatle songs. Based soley on that I bought the DVD. My mistake....I should have read the cover closer. The songs are sung by American Idol wanna-be type actors. I just about turned it off when this Asian cheerleader is singing \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\"...awful, just awful. But the story got a little better. But this is more than anything else, a \\"musical\\" and quite frankly, the musical performances are not very good. I made a mistake buying this. Should have rented the movie from iTunes for $3 in lieu of spending $20. Good idea on paper ...maybe, but having anyone else but the Beatles do Beatle songs is always gonna fall short.

0784011710|4.0|I read Styron's novel, Sophie's Choice, when it first came out.  I was mesmerized all the way through.  I didn't go to see the movie in the theatre because, knowing the story, I didn't want to be depressed.  A couple of years ago, I bought the movie, but it sat on the shelf for a long time, unwatched until last night when I viewed it with my family, none of whom had read the book.<br /><br />My Polish husband left the room about half way through because he just couldn't stand to be reminded of things that were way too real for him.  The rest of us continued to watch, hypnotized by the inexorable unfolding of the tragedy.  After it was over, nobody spoke for a very long time. It's that kind of movie.<br /><br />There is something about the movie, though, that disturbs me.  You see, the book had a certain emphasis that was excluded from the movie version.  In Styron's novel, he is explicit about the parallels between the Nazi/Jew atrocities and the terrible abuses of the American South against Black Americans.  This was an important theme - the universality of suffering - that he then developed more fully by making Sophie, a NON-Jew, the center of the story.  In the novel, the suffering of the Jews IS discussed, but it is made quite clear that Hitler's main target was the Slavs.  He carefully makes his case that the Holocaust is NOT an exclusively Jewish experience or tragedy. The fact is, 6 million Polish citizens were killed by the Nazis, only half of which were Jews.  The other three million victims were Polish Christians and Catholics. For the Nazis, the Poles were, in fact, the First Target:  \\"All Poles will disappear from the world.... It is essential that the great German people should consider it as its major task to destroy all Poles.\\"  (Heinrich Himmler)<br /><br />Hitler quickly took control of Poland by specifically targeting and eliminating the Polish Intelligentsia. During the next few years, millions of other Polish citizens were rounded up made slaves for German farmers and factories or taken to concentration camps where they were either starved and worked to death or used for scientific experiments.<br /><br />The Jews in Poland were forced inside ghettos, but the non-Jews were made prisoners in the concentration camps very early, as well as inside their own country. No one was allowed out.<br /><br />That's what Sophie's Choice was about, mainly: the suffering of the Poles, and Sophie exemplified this suffering.  But this major theme has been completely lost in the movie version.<br /><br />Nathan, the \\"spokesman for the Jews\\" in the story, is a paranoid schizophrenic which might be considered a subtle way to portray the \\"paranoid\\" nature of the Jewish claim for Holocaust exclusivity.  Entwined with the major theme of the book is Nathan's inability to cope with the fact that Sophie, a Polish-Catholic, experienced horrifying  sufferings that were claimed to be exclusively Jewish.<br /><br />The monstrous decision that Sophie is forced to make (sometimes idiomatically used as way of describing a choice between two unbearable options, a  \\"Sophie's Choice\\"), is not even fully portrayed in the film version.  In the novel, Sophie describes the fussing and whining and crying of her daughter who was sick with an untreated ear infection prior to being forced to make the choice.  It is suggested that her choice was partly influenced by her irritation at the child which makes it all the more monstrous.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gives a fabulous performance as do Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol.  All three are perfect for their roles.  The movie is only slightly slow, but still manages to carry the viewer along.  It could have been a better movie if the nuances of Sophie's choice as well as the primary themes of the book had been included.  These elements would have made it stupendous instead of just excellent.<br /><br />All through the book and movie, Sophie faces choices and in every instance, she chooses from a position of illusion of safety and fear, and it seems to be suggested that when she chooses, someone dies as a consequence of her choice.<br /><br />For example, after her father and her husband have been taken by the Nazis (at that point, you would think that Sophie would have realized that there was no rationality to Nazism since her father and husband were supporters of the Nazis and died anyway), she has a lover, J&oacute;zef, who, with his half-sister, Wanda, is a member of the Polish Resistance. They ask Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but fearing she might get into trouble, she refuses. Two weeks later, J&oacute;zef is murdered by the Gestapo.  One gets the impression that if Sophie had helped, this might not have happened, but that is uncertain.  It is only a short time later that Sophie is arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children.  So, again, holding back, acting out of fear for the self, trying to protect the self, is not seen to be a good choice.<br /><br />When Sophie is in line at Auschwitz, she again tries to save herself and her children by telling a doctor that she is a good catholic, a supporter of the Reich, etc.  Even though she is pretending to support the Nazis out of fear for herself and her children, and trying to save them, it is this act that precipitates the terrible choice.  There is clearly no humanity in the Nazi mentality and that is something that Sophie never seems to grasp.  She continues to think that they are normal humans, that they can be reasoned with, their consciences appealed to, when it is clear they are psychopaths and have no consciences at all.  This occurs again in her interactions with camp commandant Hess.  She refuses to help others by stealing a radio, and caves in to her fears again and pretends to be a Nazi supporter to try to save herself and her son.<br /><br />Again and again Sophie makes the wrong choices.  Finally, Sophie seems to understand that saving herself isn't worth what she has paid with the coin of her soul.  She returns to the deadly embrace of her Jewish lover who, in his paranoid schizophrenia, takes both their lives.<br /><br />Perhaps a prophetic lesson for our own times. It's a beautiful film, but it could have been better with very little effort.that when she chooses, someone dies as a consequence of her choice.     For example, after her father and her husband have been taken by the Nazis (at that point, you would think that Sophie would have realized that there was no rationality to Nazism since her father and husband were supporters of the Nazis and died anyway), she has a lover, Józef, who, with his half-sister, Wanda, is a member of the Polish Resistance. They ask Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but fearing she might get into trouble, she refuses. Two weeks later, Józef is murdered by the Gestapo.  One gets the impression that if Sophie had helped, this might not have happened, but that is uncertain.

B0012BTBQU|5.0|Solid, solid book. I borrowed it from a friend after reading Elantris. This one is just as good. But the sequel is just straight awesome. So I would give this one say, 4.5, but the sequal definitely gets the full 5.8 stars.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I was going to say \\"best office comedy\\" but I didn't want to limit the recommendation. This is one of the best comedy's EVER...period. Having worked in a \\"big company\\" for the last 30 years I can say that this one hits VERY close to home. Yep, we even have \\"Milton\\" types where I work. This is one of my \\"desert island\\" movies and I would never give it up. Worth many many viewings. I loved it.
B000OONTFU|5.0|My bf loved it!!!!!!!!! In these kind on movies you can really understand what \\"Hign Definition\\" means. I can't believe the studios are supporting blu-ray... HD-DVD is WAY better (and cheaper)... So why we have to buy super expensive blu-ray players that don't give you the same quality & sound than an HD-DVD player (which btw costs only 120 bucks).
B000YPUFA6|4.0|Dear Amazon:<br />  RE Extinction was a good movie with outstanding special effects and in the mode of \\"Road Warrior\\".  This movie is the third of a series of Resident Evil; like the other two ---- this one follows the plot so viewers can understand the story of the Extinction.<br />  Plenty of action and the special effects dominate the spectacle making it a fast paced movie.  A very entertaining movie, but for a mature audience due to the violent content.<br /><br />  Sincerely,<br />  M. Ceballos<br />  Concord, CA.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|This series and book was the focus of an honors natural science class I took as a freshman at Michigan State. I fell in love. I went all over the world from my seat in class, and Dr. Bronowski was my guide. For an indifferent student of history in junior high and high school, with the usual rote memorization and dry presentation, Dr. Bronowski's passion and enthusiasm opened up the world of science, history, art and architecture for me. While some of the science may be a little dated since the 1970's, Dr. Bronowski's love of the subject and his communication of that love is not.  I recommend this series whole-heartedly, particularly for high school students.
B0008ENHT4|5.0|The car chase in Bullitt may seem a bit less impressive than it once did because filmmakers have been trying to top it for the best part of four decades. More of a cat-and-mouse game than a demolition derby, its overshadowed by the film's other action setpieces - a murder in a safe house, a tense chase in a hospital and a great airport finale that Michael Mann ripped off wholesale in Heat. A beautifully constructed star vehicle for Steve McQueen at his best, it's pretty much the prototype for every Hollywood cop movie that followed, but benefits from good casting (Robert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Simon Oakland, Robert Duvall), better characterisation than the norm and a low key approach from director Peter Yates that makes the highs seem a lot more effective than they should. The plot's not bad either, with Lalo Schifrin contributing a cool score and Pablo Ferra a terrific main title sequence.     The 2-disc set certainly boasts an improved transfer over the original single-disc release, but aside from Yates audio commentary, a vintage making of featurette and the trailer, the extras aren't that film specific - a good feature-length documentary on film editing and another on McQueen.
B000OVLBIU|4.0|The special effects are really good in Blu-ray. We bought this so that we could get a free remote for our new PS3. Unfortunately Blu-ray provided a little too much definition to Nicolas Cage's toupee or weave or whatever he had on his head; enough so that it became distracting.
0321525655|5.0|First off I have to admit I am a bit bias, I have read Garr blog for years now.  Nonetheless, this book embodies what a great powerpoint is and isn't.      Be careful what you wish for, after reading this book you may have an epiphany that 95% of the power points presented are truly awful.    A lot of the content and concepts of the book are covered in his blog, but this is a better easy to use offline reference.
0525950079|5.0|This book was amazing; I loved it. I read Pillars in high school, and now, six years later, I love the sequel just as much. Actually, I need to dig out Pillars again! This book is interesting, relevant, vivid and makes the reader care about Merthin and Caris, pity and despise Ralph, and long to see the totalitarian dictatorship of the prior be sent away. It's hefty and it takes some time (took me 2 weeks, and I read fast) but go for it. You won't be disappointed.
B00013RC8O|4.0|Easy Rider may have somehow become the defining film of its day, heralding a plethora of clichéd road moves, but I'll stick with Vanishing Point. It may have been the inspiration for Smokey and the Bandit, which added jokes, beer and a happy ending to the equation, but four decades on it's aged much better than Hopper's drug-fuelled road trip thanks to a combination of great visuals and some great car stunts. On the debit side there's some very unfortunate gay stereotyping in one sequence and the Charlotte Rampling scene from the UK version (which, ironically, can now only be found on the US DVD) does unfortunately slow the picture down to a dead stop at exactly the wrong time, but as speed-fuelled nihilism goes it's still a great ride.     While the UK DVD only includes the trailer and the shorter American cut of the film, the Region 1 NTSC DVD is a much better proposition, including both the 98-minute US cut, the 105-minute UK cut, an audio commentary by director Richard C. Sarafian, trailer and two TV spots.
B00018D44U|3.0|Only three stars because this recording has too many different music styles. Some nice and sultry, some country, some hillbilly, some jazz.  Several songs don't fit her voice well. If you're looking for some Nora Jones consistency, this isn't it.

B001041JLE|5.0|\\"For All Time\\" is my new treasure. Beautiful ballad, proving that MJ still has it.   All the original tracks are beautifully remastered, reminding us why Michael Jackson is the King of Pop, Rock, and Soul.   \\"P.Y.T. 2008\\" is my favorite remix from Thriller 25. It's fresh and 'dance-able', just like we expect from Michael Jackson. I absolutely love it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|In my opinion, there is no comparison between this 1995 film adaptation and the latest Persuasion just issued. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are far superor in breathing life into Austen's characters in this story. Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, in the latest remake, are flat with little tension or real interest between them. The story, too, has been streamlined and lacks the depth of this original. Don't bother with the latest...this is the one to order and enjoy!
B0006UYOJM|3.0|I ordered 2 of the Faces (gold disc's) by Audio Fidelity, brand new from the online Amazon store. They came incomplete without the shown slipcover. At first they were going to replace them at no cost but come to find out Amazon was not able to send the slipcovers and instead offered a 20% discount. I would rather have had the slipcovers over the 20% refund but agreed to the discount over returning the items.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|So-so is accurate if you have the VHS version in Hi-Fi.  I had the VHS version for years, and then purchased the DVD in hopes of better sound quality, and having good luck upscaling in my DVD, and neither worked well.  The sound quality appears worse than my VHS, and the tunes are mixed differently- which is okay, but wasn't what I expected.  For some reason this does not upscale well for being a recent release.  If you look into it, it appears they originally filmed this concert on \\"video\\" instead of film- whatever that exactly means; but they had a difficult time in the conversion which is why this was only recently released on DVD.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This version of Persuasion is not my favorite.  This actress can't compare to Amanda Root, though this Captain Wentworth is handsome. There are two scenes that are so out of the Edwardiarn era that I can't justify liking this film version.  When Anne Elliot runs around town looking for Captain Wentworth, I nearly laughed until I cried.  No respectable woman of that time period would ever carry on that way in public, let alone in private.  In addition, there is a ridiculous 5 minute unrequited kiss that is absurd! I felt like saying, \\"Oh, get on with it!\\" All in all, not my favorite film version of Persuasion.
B000062X90|5.0|This is simply a great CD - cool songs, great guitar work (some of the best harmony leads this side of Derek and the Dominos), and great singing, well worth buying.
1933492279|5.0|This book gives a very nice overview of d.s. working style.  The simple sketches have a magic abstract touch, and the renderings are very sophisticated, all of hem in grays.   Most of them are big enough to really feel the viewed image.    He understands to create a certain kind of magic I haven't seen with any other concept designer besides Robertson, Church and Goerner.    The interesting fact is that all sketches are drawn on paper and hen overworked in photoshop which I think is really nice especially nowadays w everybody seems to go crazy about the cintiq.     His understanding of adding details at the right place of his vehicles is  mind-blowing ! Nothing seems overshaped !, also the 3d models are very very nice, but with closer looks some textures are appealing cheap to me.    He defenatly brings it to the next level by combining all production methods for a very satisfying result.    I would have liked to see a little bit more stuff one cannot find on his site.    Thus only 4.5    defenately a HUGE inspiration for all designers and a most for all fans of the concept design genre.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This one is going to be a classic among women who like their romance sweet and sensible and their stories familiar but fun. I hope someone is paying attention because Eckhart and Zeta-Jones could be the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pairing for the 21st century. It's a bit of a stretch seeing him as an opera buff, but other than that, he's flawless. His acting is directly on point and the character is written as a hero with a modern sensibility - not quite a metrosexual, but not the strong silent type either. He expresses his feelings openly in a wonderfully sexy way.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is pleasant in her part, in that odd way she has of seeming like an every-woman character in spite of her stunning looks. You feel as if you've known this character. The story line with the sister is predictably sad and played for effect, but the little girl is a scene stealer - she's entirely believable.<br /><br />Some of the antics at the restaurant stretch your ability to suspend disbelief, but it's never so over the top that you can't see it happening that way in a place much better than you've ever worked in. It's all tied up in the requisite but perfect happy ending. I'll watch this one over and over and it's one I'll make all my girlfriends watch, too.
0767836324|1.0|Cannot imagine a worse Spielberg movie.  This movie must have been a hoot for all of the stars in it to make, but the editing room must have been a morgue when they realized they could not piece together anything that would make a decent story.  It has some great visual effects, some pretty good visual effects, and a bunch of schlocky stuff too.  Recently saw this in HD on cable and some of the props don't hold up to the clarity provided by HDTV, much the same as how whole TV stage sets have had to be remade to accommodate HDTV...
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a really wonderful story about a larger than life man, and his son's struggles to know who his father really is.    I really recomend this film - It has great acting, beautiful costumes and is such a fantastical inspring story.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I really love this show! The dialogue is so smart and the storylines are well written.  It is unlike anything else on television.  Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have great chemistry.  I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a good scare, some laughs, and great characters!
B000FGGE68|2.0|A fairly entertaining movie, but pretty shallow when it comes to story. The action/fighting is very exaggregated and I think it fails to do whatever it tries to do. It comes out pretty stupid at times. 5/10.
1568461828|5.0|This edition is simply beautiful and we're really glad that we got it. The illustrations are gorgeous. This book is a keepsake. Charles Dickens is, without a doubt, one of the greatest storytellers ever. This story is one of the best ever. Our entire family is loving this story - 3 generations of us! - the oldest being in his late 70's and the youngest is 8. Proof a great story. Everyone loves the pictures. Amongst the most beautiful ever!
0792163710|5.0|I first saw Shane when I was about the same age as little Joey in the film. Even at the age I am now, I still enjoyed watching the film and felt as much excitement as I did those long years ago. I still think that Shane is still the best Western ever, and even age, my age, has not wiped out the excitement of watching it. What is more, is that even my brother, who is ten years older than me, enjoyed it equally!  H.M
B000UJCALI|5.0|Just as good as the first time I'd seen it.  Though looking back, the first time I saw it, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  Now that I've seen it again a few times, it kind of gets boring.  I guess I just want to have something new so quickly the literary and film world can't keep up.
0743544676|5.0|This book was on the New York best sellers list for good reasons. Very often, countless women are crushed by their romantic relationships. They intensely worry and struggle to figure out what \\"they\\" did wrong.   They likely did not do anything wrong at all. The man that broke off with them simply \\" was not into you\\" and was wasting your time and energy. He is doing you a favor to let you free to seek the true and sincere man you are yet to find. He does you a favor when he breaks off with you and there's nothing wrong with YOU !
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Sometimes a Sequel will be a let down.  This movie does not do that.  If you like Underworld, you will like Evolution.  Kate Beckinsale is incredible in this.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Watching this on 720p is breath taking...1080p would be even better!  I have just seen one of the discs so far an I was blown away.  100% of it was HD quality.  This version is in 1080p compared to the Discovery channel version which is 1080i.  Highly recommend it to any fan of nature programs and even casual audiences since it doesn't go into too much detail of any one topic.  This has very high replay-value.
B0001CCXZW|1.0|I have not received the Gilmore Girls DVD I ordered there for I cannot review it.  However the money has been taken out of my account.    Patsy Cannon
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Great Movie, great effects, Kate Beckinsale! If you like these three thing, you must see both.
6305428557|5.0|It's Hugh Grant-what more could you ask for? It is a period flick about two English cartographers measuring mountains for maps during the war and all the citizens go through to get their mountain on the map. Very charming!
0374105235|1.0|I am shocked at the reviews of this book! People are dumber than I thought! This book is a first class lie. Ishmael did not kill anyone, and all his contradictions in this book make me laugh. The \\"Rap\\" tape that falls out of his pocket on two occasions to save him; running from wild meat eating pigs for a half a mile. Remember he was almost going to be stabbed by a rebel boy  and the next thing he know the boy had been stabbed by his friend? It sounds like a Rambo movie. This is what happened, he came to the U.S. and read about child solders in Sierra Leone, and decided he would be come one, and wrote a nice fictional account. No one can disprove his account, because he came to the US alone, and we can't verify the story. For someone who claims they brutally killed \\"countless\\" humans, this book rings hollow and untrue.
B0012QE4OO|2.0|the speical effexs was good, decent but the story could of been better. through out the story i heard people i audiance say and ask waht did tha mean, doyou know waht that ment? i heard a few say you go me i'm lost, so againt he story could of been better the fx's was good but story nto so good
B000F8O4E0|4.0|There are days when \\"Face The Music\\" is my favorite ELO CD, switching with [[ASIN:B000F8O4DQ A New World Record]] and [[ASIN:B000LE0TGA Out of the Blue]]. But for sheer over-the-top surprise, this fourth effort from Electric Light Orchestra could not be beat. From the moment the psychedelic introduction sucks you into \\"Fire On High\\" till the final fade of (the original) beautiful LP closing \\"One Summer Dream,\\" Jeff Lynne took his concepts of orchestral pop and completed them in a way the other albums had hinted at.<br /><br />This was also the home of ELO's career establishing singles, \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Strange Magic.\\" It made \\"Face The Music\\" ELO's first US top ten album and firmly established them as a top concert draw, not too mention two of the best songs to get on the radio in 1975. The band was still forging its sound (future albums would venture more and more to the pop side), but the condensed prog-rock like \\"Fire On High\\" took the excess of ELP to tight digestible nuggets. \\"Night Rider\\" is also one of the overlooked songs in the ELO library, with Jeff Lynne writing a brief autobiography of his early days in a traveling band. Lynne's fascination with country gets an early workout here, on \\"Down Home Town.\\"<br /><br />The bonus tracks add to the story, with the bare-bones mix of \\"Fire On High\\" offering a fascinating look into the thought process of making a song. A stripped down \\"Evil Woman\\" (with additional lyrics) Lynne claims in the liner notes that he likes better than the ultimate album version. Even with these more minimalist version present, \\"Face The Music\\" stands as the moment when Jeff Lynne and the members of ELO perfected their sound and production, to the point that the this and their next two albums still rival any music being created to this date.
B0013RC3NQ|5.0|This is a fantastic story of two sisters one of whom enters into an unfortunate marriage not knowing anything about the danger this decision will pose to her life. It is a romance and a mystery.  Lots of turns and twists all written in a beautiful language.  I can't help but see it as a great period film!  Kindle version has lots of errors in it.  Words run into each other, some that should not be capitalized are and vice versa. Some are deformed.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|This version of _Persuasion_ looks pretty and manages to clarify certain aspects of the plot early on better than the Root film. Unfortunately, that's about all it does. The actors are probably fine (if a bit too polished), but they are given nothing to work with.     Watching this film is like substituting your freshman English notes for the actual novel. It hits the highlights but doesn't slow down enough to make anything dramatic or memorable. If you liked the Keira Knightley version of _Pride & Prejudice_, you might like this film, too, since the two share similar strengths and weaknesses.     You will sense something is \\"off\\" even if you've never read the book. The film doesn't go far enough in originality to compensate for its shoddy treatment of the source. Things move quickly but, at the same time, lack suspense.     A good adaptation needed to be longer. A good interpretation needed to be better plotted. At the end, the film is just empty calories. Watch it, if you've never seen the Root film or read the book. But expect to feel kind of \\"meh\\" afterwards.
B00138J7V6|5.0|Beautifully done song. He's saying what anyone and everyone says at one point. I like the way he says it. Judging by the other reviews I'm not the only one. :) Keep it up Gavin. We're looking for more of that creative spirit.
B000003N8R|5.0|I bought this a couple of years ago while I was on vacation in Vancouver. I was at a record store, when I spotted this one. I bought it. I listened, and came to conclusion that it was probably his best. The title track especially is awesome. It's 8+ minutes of killer saxophone, as only Coltrane can deliver.    Other highlights for me on this Coltrane epic include 'The Drum Thing,' 'Bessie's Blues,' and 'Wise One.' This was released on the Impulse label, which was purchased by MCA years ago. The sound quality on the remastered disc is simply amazing.    If you enjoyed this Coltrane record, check these out:    A Love Supreme-Impulse  Blue Train-Blue Note  Giant Steps-Atlantic  My Favorite Things-Atlantic  With Thelonious Monk-Verve    This is highly recommended. Check out his best compilation too, 'Ken Burns JAZZ Collection.'     ENJOY!!!
B000058983|5.0|Somewhere between the seaweed strands of pure fantasy and the lucit luminous lights of imagination in a colourful semi-concious state is where this selection resides. I will always be willing to hear other opinions. But, for me, this deserves the legendary status that has been bestowed upon it. And I will get to the why and wherefor shortly.<br /><br />But first, I think you have to look at this band from the start. Arthur Lee, the leader and main contributor of this band, set out on a direction in music that was totally unheard of in the pop arena at the time. I mean, who else wrote about the despair of a drug addict in 1966? But, although this was included in their first effort, which was unusual but accessible pop at the time, there were more things in store for us from this very different band.<br /><br />Arthur's creativity (and mind) took amazing leaps. They could do rock- acoustic rock- acoustic - punk - country and whatever format they wanted to. And let us not even discuss mega-talented. Yes, Love was THE group to be reckoned with in the 60's. But, strangely, they were an esoteric find to say the least. That is because Arthur, the true to form non-conformist that he was, was not into touring and pleasing the masses. So, they kept on but were relegated to a secondary staus when, in all honesty, they could have topped everyone at the time as the premier American band. I don't think Arthur cared very much. Art is art- after all.<br /><br />We now come to \\"Forever Changes\\" and what it all means. Hard to answer. But first, let us discuss the music. Never have there been such a perfect marriage of smooth pop-rock confection with gliding velvety orchestration. But this time, Arthur was through with his raucous excursions of trying to make a point. This time, he geared the music in such a way that everybody could understand it. Wisely imbedding subliminal messages within the surrealistic, psychedelic stream of conciousness that weaves it's way throughout this amazing c.d.<br /><br />All songs are delightfully listenable. But, as pleasant as it is, Arthur asks very pertinent questions here and poses hard-edged questions and situations that he asks you to consider (some not so pleasant). Thematically, we run the spectrum of love-hate-race relations-connection-fear-mortality-death. All things that run through the human psyche. And, as a true Seer, I detect some spirituality as well. These are just a few reasons why this c.d. is so monumental. So much contained within so little. But it takes an imaginative and astute listener to get it.<br /><br />Of course we have the common love dilemmas in \\"Alone Again Or\\", \\"Andmoreagain\\" and \\"Old Man\\". But Arthur goes deeper in other songs. In \\"A House is Not a Motel\\" he travels into metaphysical terrain with the line, \\"You are just a thought that someone, somewhere, somehow feels you should be here\\". Not only that - but he becomes a psychic as well with \\"the news today will be the movies for tomorrow\\". Snippets and tidbits of always being ahead - in substance - in thought. That was Arthur Lee.<br /><br />You can get nuances of reincarnation in \\"The Red Telephone\\" with \\"I've been here once, I've been here twice\\". And universal personal connection with the line, \\"If you think I'm unhappy, count me (fill in your own particular shade)\\". He reveals succint aspects of confrontation, as in \\"Live and Let Live\\" with recognizing your artillery. It is this ability to peer into the common denominator that make these songs so rich.<br /><br />The passages and changes (forever) in this music are a marvel - and so very addicting. In the closing song, \\"You Set the Scene\\" stresses the need to make it all right because of the short time we all have here. Mortality revealed - but with so much beauty. It's up to you. Yes, you set the scene. We all do.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this c.d. but it would, in the end, only be my take on it. There are so many things here - for everybody. But, as art is known to do, it is what you, personally, get from it. My feeling? It is a masterpiece, for the very reasons I've set down here. Something for everyone. Wonderful.<br /><br />It's an ESSENTIAL for any true, pop-rock archive. Take my word.<br /><br />Forever metamorphosizing ----- Metamorpho ;)t is a masterpiece, for the very reasons I've set down here. Something for everyone. Wonderful.    It's an ESSENTIAL for any true, pop-rock archive. Take my word.    Forever metamorphosizing ----- Metamorpho ;)
B000C1YL1G|5.0|Eminem is a rap icon. His rhymes are simply too good to be true. He's one of the top stars in the hip hop genre. And, in 2005, he finally got a hits compilation.     'Curtain Call: The Hits' starts out with a hilarious skit, and than gets into 'Fack,' which isn't one of the highlights in my opinion on the disc. The beat is catchy, though.    I'll just go into the highlights, because I don't want to ramble. 'Without Me,' 'Sing For The Moment,' 'Mockingbird,' his 2001 duet at the GRAMMYS with rock legend Elton John 'Stan,' and 'Like Toy Soldiers.'    However, I wouldn't mind seeing 'Superman' or 'Drips' on here from his 2002 record 'The Eminem Show.' Other than that, no complaints whatsoever. A nice little career retrospective from one of the best rap artists of all-time. Plus, the new songs are excellent, too.    Highly recommended for the new Eminem fan and the die-hard Eminem fan for the new songs. ENJOY!!!
