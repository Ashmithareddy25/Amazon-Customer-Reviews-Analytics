8185300534|5.0|Rather than writing a bunch of superlatives for this incredible book, I will simply suggest you experience it for yourself... <br />Other excellent books in a similar but different spirit (that will complement your understanding of Advaita) are \\"Who Cares?!\\" by Ramesh Balsekar, and \\"Oneness\\" by John Greven.
0140177396|4.0|This is my favorite Steinbeck novel. It is a beautiful story and a must read.  One of the few books that I would like to read again.  Simply put, this is the story of a TRUE friendship between two men, one of whom is mentally challenged.  Read it!!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Excellent - almost magical - presentation.  Pure voices and a violinist more like a little elph than a flesh and bones creature!
0446310786|4.0|After years and years of hearing about this book, I finally read it and was NOT disappointed.  It is a classic for good reason.  Great story for the young and old.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|Though there have certainly been more than a few reissues of this marvelous album, this Rudy Van Gelder 24-bit resolution remaster is definitely a wonderful version to acquire. With a voluminous and ultimately lush sound, 1957's \\"Blue Train\\" opens to the title track with Coltrane in such a way that grabs the listener's attention. While Coltrane was clearly still heavily influenced by the approach of Charlie Parker as far as his playing was concerned, his compositional line of attack demonstrates a uniqueness entirely his own. This album is undoubtedly one of my favorite albums from Coltrane as a leader.<br /><br />Accompanying Coltrane on this album was a very young Lee Morgan on trumpet, Kenny Drew on keys, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Philly Joe Jones on drums and the one and only Paul Chambers on bass. While this is not the Coltrane one finds on his landmark \\"A Love Supreme\\", it does demonstrate his superiority among other saxophonists of this time. An altogether pleasant outing here that is sure to delight newcomers to this man; \\"Blue Train\\" should be one of the first few albums by this Coltrane listeners should buy. I know this RVG edition gets plenty of use in this household.
0064410935|5.0|Probably the BEST children's book ever written. Everyone should read this book as a child AND again as an adult.  It doesn't get any better than this!!
B00005JPFQ|5.0|I must admit I am a comic book fan but not as much as I use to be. But man these people are fanatics and are bashing this movie way too much. Before I go any further I am a ghost rider fan and I own a few ghost rider comics. So what I saw in the film I thought was what I expected for ghost rider. There was some funny one liner jokes but come on it is a comic book movie. But to get to the point this film I thought had some really cool special efects and I liked the story also. This movie made me think of spawn in a way but not so campy but I liked that movie too. For me I have no complaints for this movie. In my final words I think people should check this film out fan or not of the ghost rider comic.
0380778556|5.0|One of my favorite books EVER!!  This book truly does have a little bit of everything.  The magic of this book for me is how so much of its story is really untold.  The reader is forced to fill in the blanks, but in the end you know that you were right all along.  How brilliant is it that the main character never utters a word, that Manderly is a main character itself, and yet another main character has no name at all? (Not to mention Mrs. Danvers, YIKES!! )  Please read this book!!!!  For me this is one of those books that I can't see how EVERYONE doesn't love it!!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I'm a late bloomer when it comes to some pieces of literature,  and when I finally started reading Jane Austen in my 30's,   this book stood out as my definite favorite.   I bought a video of the movie when it first came out,  and feel that it captures perfectly the subdued mood and mature humour of the last masterpiece of this magic author.      I recently got the movie out again,  this time because I'm introducing Austen to my home-schooled 12 year old daughter.    Hopefully she won't be the literary ignoramus her mother was,  she already \\"gets\\"  the perfect phrasing and subtle humour that I probably would not have appreciated at her age.  <br />     I've not seen other adaptations of Persuasion,   but don't see how another could so perfectly capture the essence of the novel.    The performances are perfect,   with Anne being transformed from plain neglected spinster to beautiful beloved wife before our very eyes.   The movie portrays Austen's characters as they surely would have been,   no makeup,   a bit dingy in spots,   surrounded by farm animals in the country,   fishwives in Lyme,  and the elegant viciousness of the first circles in Bath.     I think Ciaran Hinds is one of today's great actors,  and watch him every chance I get,  and he and Amanda Root are fabulous together,  both in this and in \\"The Man Who Cried.\\"   For anyone who appreciates Austen,  as it took me so long to do,   this movie is an absolute must for their collection.
0142000663|4.0|I think that everyone should read this book.  It is very deserving of all of its praise.  It probably was not my favorite Steinbeck, but is definately a true classic.  While I sometimes find Steinbeck a bit too descriptive and wordy, he definately tells a beautiful story.
B00005MP58|5.0|I'm sure I can say nothing about this version of P&P that hasn't already been said (better,   probably) by another reviewer.   All I can say is that with this version in existence,   I wonder that anyone felt the need to make another one as they did two years ago,   with Keira Knightly.    I don't think it is possible to improve upon this version,  and....sure enough,   they didn't.   If you only watch one adaptation of Austen's masterpiece,   let it be this one.
0307275639|4.0|Very well written.  I loved this book and felt every emotion imaginable while reading it.  Well deserved of all of its acclaim.  I felt like Mitch Albom just told the story, not too much, not too little. Wonderful!!
0446677450|5.0|Absolutely one of the greatest books I've ever read. Please tell me how come these type of books were not out when I attended High School? Anyone! Hello!  Robert Kiyosaki opens the eyes for many individuals who may have been doubtful of opening their own businesses.  Rich Dad Poor Dad has motivated me in ways that never came to my mind prior to me reading it. This book is awesome! Did I fail to mention that it is very easy to read.
B0000640SB|4.0|A very good comedy, Men in Black sheds light on a secret government agency that monitors alien activity.  Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino (who is HOT!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.    The setting, the plot, the music, the humor, and the dialogues are all wonderful!  Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!
B00006JDVV|4.0|I remember there being lots of hype about this film when it was released to the theaters, but then it seemed to disappear. This led me to believe that it was going to be a flop. I got the DVD as a gift, so I didn't expect too much when I sat down to watch it. <br /> <br />First off, the special effects were fantastic. The dragons looked quite good, even so much as having holes in the membranes of their wings from fighting with either other dragons, or people on the ground. The audio was quite good as well, and makes for a good 5.1 experience if you have a home theatre system. <br /> <br />The acting was good as well, but then again, you have guys like Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale. I especially liked the interraction between the two characters - the good, and the bad. The storyline was really the only thing that made me drop it from 5 stars down to 4.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />****Spoiler Below.  Skip this section if you don't want to know a major plot point of the film. *** <br /> <br />The idea that there are millions of dragons running around, and there's only one male seemed, well, just plain stupid to me. But, they needed a way that a small group of fighters could bring down the entire dragon empire in one fell swoop. This one item made me drop the rating because to me, it just wasn't plausible that all the dragons born were female. <br /> <br />*** Spoiler Over  Keep Reading *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Aside from the item above, I liked the film. It's a good thing to add to your collection, especially if you're a fan of dragons, or either of the two main actors.
B00005JKZ3|5.0|A very good comedy, Men in Black II picks up four years after the first movie left off, and continues to shed light on Earth's finest agents.  This time the arrival of an unexpected guest from outer space will rock their world... <br />Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Lara Flynn Boyle and Rosario Dawson (both of whom are HOT!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.   <br />The setting, the plot, the music, the humor, and the dialogues are all wonderful! <br />Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!  4.5 Stars <br />
0061148512|5.0|In a world of over-medicated persons, \\"The Bell Jar\\" delivers what modern medicine cannot... a look into the life of a person without the use of modern medication or therapies.  \\"The Bell Jar\\" delivers an insight into the world of the depressed woman, then and now.  For a person in some sort of depressed state, Sylvia Plath gives us a world in which someone \\"understands\\".<br />While she did not end her life on a good note, for those in need of understanding and not just \\"a good read\\", \\"The Bell Jar\\" offers a shoulder to lean on... a possible much needed cry.<br /><br />If you are reading this just as a classic novel, her metaphor and use of grammar to convey her life and loss is at it's peak.  She give us a story thick with imagery, location, and tangible emotion.  Her vivid scope of mental illness and the lengths one will go to in a chance to feel something other than a sense of loss or anguish, is all at once painful and beautiful.  You know exactly where she is coming from, even if you have never experienced it for yourself.  She transports us to a place and state of mind that is malicious and elegant... troubled and decadent.<br /><br />Sylvia's poetry is wonderful, if that is what you are looking for.  But it is her novels, short stories, letters, and prose that can send you to a place where even the average person feels a kinship with this tortured soul.  And tortured is exactly what she conveys....  those demons that in the end, caught up with her all too soon.

One note about the guitar(s) sound on this album. This album was recorded using 5 watt Fender Champ tube amps from the 50's, that is why the GTRS sound big, small amps = big sound in the studio. <br />
B00026WU64|5.0|I'm one of those who thinks Dylan should have never have gone electric.  Listening to this again after a long absence just firms up that belief for me.
B000002KOO|4.0|I'm knocking down 1 star for a few weak tracks and horrible sound, Peter Green always said if they had a better producer, they would have been huge in the beginning era of the group. <br /> <br />1. Coming Your Way - Danny Kirwin is coming into his own on this record.  <br />2. Closing My Eyes - Great dual guitar harmonys after the last verse and haunting track overall with kettle drum by Mick.  <br />3. Show-Biz Blues - Not my Favorite,acoustic steel blues rave up   <br />4. My Dream - Instrumental by Danny  <br />5. Underway - Another instrumental this time it's Peter's  <br />6. Oh Well - Peter Green's big moment, the classical part is too longgggg.   <br />7. Although The Sun Is Shining - Kirwin's haunting voice is center stage here  <br />8. Rattlesnake Shake - Another forgettable joke number about Mick   <br />9. Searching For Madge - Jam 1  <br />10. Fighting For Madge - Jam 2  <br />11. When You Say - Kirwin is a loss for words  <br />12. LIke Crying - Kirwins song about a girl who likes girls  <br />13. Before The Beginning - Peter's swan song, scary song and one of his all time best  <br /> <br />
B00000K3G8|5.0|Simply the single best set by any band in the history of rock and roll.  I know there will be people out there who will point to some Dead concert that's only available on a third generation cassette, but this set is as hot as the Heads ever were.  The expanded edition is a great gift to the world.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This album is a masterpiece, it's almost a Lindsay Buckingham solo album in all but name. The public never really \\"got it\\" apart from Stevies \\"Sara\\", \\"Think About Me\\" and \\"Tusk\\". I think it's way over peoples heads, I have a lot of respect for Buckingham because he experimented and moved forward here, instead of delivering what most of the people wanted, a \\"Rumours Part 2\\". He is the Brian Wilson of our generation. <br />
B000002I2M|5.0|I've been busy listening to the Doors in chronological order, and you can definitely hear Jim aging voice here.  The total product is simply brilliant: strong musicianship, great songs, and Jim's voice.  Next time I'm in Paris, I must stop back to thank him.

B00005JPKE|5.0|In order to appreciate my review of this film, I want you to picture the conditions in which I saw it: I was late to the theater, and the place was packed (6:30 showing on a Saturday night at a popular mall). My fiancee and I were relegated to the very, very front seats--the ones no one sits in--to the far right of the auditorium. We were probably less than ten feet from the screen. It was then that we discovered that the entire film was in subtitles; my fiancee later commented that we had to create our own \\"Pan and Scan\\" to watch the film. Consider also: 2 and a half hours long. My neck was aching from about minute 10.    And yet...     I really enjoyed the movie. At 2 1/2 hours, it never felt long. I didn't regret being so close, usually enough to make any movie unbearably awkward. This is a smart, powerful film, engrossing from start to finish, and it made me lose myself to my surroundings, to join with the soldiers striving to defend their homes on a poor island in the Pacific.    Specifically, it's the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, and of the commander who had to wage an impossible battle. Against the American forces? Perhaps, but really the impossible battle was against his own troops and culture, which were of a tradition-bound mentality that severely tied his hands.    Beyond war, it's also a human story, as the \\"letters\\" give us background on several of the players, and show us how the Japanese soldiers in that army were every bit as individualistic as anyone else, despite serving a society that strove to deny the individual.    In many ways, this is a bleak film, served up in a suiting palette of muted greys and browns (the movie almost appears black and white, at times). It is sad, because we know ahead of time what the result will be for the Japanese that we grow to like over the course of the tale, but within it are moments of bravery, heroism and friendship.    I'm glad for movies like this--to show us the humanity of other peoples, times and cultures, and even ones that were, once, our \\"enemies.\\" Clint Eastwood handles this difficult subject with style and respect, and delivers an emotional, enveloping tale of men pushed to their brink.    Wonderful movie. Five stars.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Love this movie! It's fun, with a good moral behind it. Everyone in my family loves it! Worth watching more than once!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a classic movie, a beloved memory from my childhood.  Dicken's genius plot is united with the adored muppets cast.  It's a great movie that I'm excited to have in my collection.  The film and sound quality are great, the only thing that I am disappointed in is the deletion of the \\"when love is gone\\" scene from the wide screen edition.  All in all, this is a great movie that everyone (child and adult) should have in their collection.
0618680004|1.0|I agree with the other criticisms and there is no need to repeat them in detail. Check out the New York Times Book Review for another negative review. I do not believe in god so I came to the book with a positive prejudice and I was very disappointed. It is disorganized, poorly written, polemical, often illogical, inane and irrational. The author treats us to language most of us have not heard since our pre-school days. Save your money.
B0000067L3|5.0|Yes. I am still at this farm in Michigan. Why? Becaue I have promised myself to stay here for peace and quiet while I review the Cream albums. But, tragedy struck again. Seems Bossy (the cow) somehow ate up all of Metamorpho's food supply and I had to walk 30 miles to the nearest food store. (Magic Seer's carpet was in for repair), So I set out and realized that I had left my fur-lined Seer's cape at home when a snow storm surprised me on the way. Luckily, a man in an old Dodge pick-up truck picked me up and gave me a ride. Amazingly, he recognized me and, for the price of an autographed picture, gave me a return trip! What luck! But, I suppose for being spiritual (and a friend of the Universe), one is entitled to such perks. Nevermind all that. Cream's EXCELLENT \\"Wheels of Fire\\" awaits us all.<br />I must elucidate on these reviews. They are done, not only because the band is so reknown, but to explain why they are so. Positively, in the psychedelic sense, they progressed and moved the music into more formidable areas. What is so amazing is that they made this double c.d. set to show you what they are capable of in the studio- and live! And this shows you the real talent behind this band. Not only could they construct inticate landscapes and unknown terrain in the studio-but also be mega as far as live recording. This was confidence of the highest order. And it shines through miraculously.<br />What do we have here exactly? We have Cream adhering to their \\"traditional\\" blues roots. On the first part they tackle Howlin' Wolf's excellent \\"Sitting On Top of the World\\" as well as \\"Politician\\" which is the best Howlin' Wolf song not written by Howlin' Wolf (accolades to Jack Bruce on this one). \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" also reflects the blues-but in a more controlled and upbeat fashion. Definitely superb! The second part-needless to say, extends blues in live fashion and never lets up. The jams, the leads, are to die for (I hate to be banal but even Metamorpho has laspes sometime).<br />I can not say enough about Jack Bruce on the first part. Superb songwriting and construction. He extends himself to bleak areas. \\"White Room\\", although pristine, gets soiled by disappointment. The lively riff is juxtaposed against feelings; and especially lines like \\"where the shadows run from themselves\\" are as vivid and unique and understood as being exemplary. \\"As You Said\\" employs his wonderful acoustic guitar (with cellos!) and interesting construction insofar as chords and keys. What are they Jack? Sharps and flats I am sure, but maybe 5ths, 9ths, and sustained? This is his songwriting. Other-worldy and quite a marvel. \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" has a little of this added as well. Ginger Baker adds his unusual \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" (a talky piece with horns even alternately between two chords!). But, recovers and proves himself with \\"Those Were the Days\\". The best Jack Bruce tune not written by Jack Bruce.<br />On part two we have his blues jam \\"Traintime\\". Can almost imagine the train click-clacking along with this harmonica inspired number. We also have Ginger Baker's wonderous drum solo again in \\"Toad\\". Much better than the original studio recording, if you ask Metamorpho. \\"Spoonful\\" is much more precise and measured. A true joy. But, then we get to the \\"core\\" of exhileration. \\"Crossroads\\", in itself, is worth the purchase of this classic c.d. Clapton's lead transcends human boundaries (and, when listened to loud, will bounce you off the walls! Just as it has done to your beloved Seer since he listened to it many Seer moons ago!).  This, I feel, was the peak of Clapton's power. Yes. He certainly has done many other excellent things (\\"Wonderful Tonight\\" just doesn't even compare to this). But, as raw live power- nothing rivals this, except Jimi at his finest. Take my word.<br />In short (!) a classic double album by one of the very best. And do remember that the cover (which your Metamorpho has tried to embed himself in and has gotten bounced out each and every time) reflected like sheer aluminum. How sad the times have compromised true value. But, you always have imagination. So says Metamorpho.<br />Like to thank T and Johnny L for their support. After all, they are better than absent guides in the long run.<br />So. That's it. One more review and I'm out of this Michigan farm. For Cream reviews, farm living is the place to stay- but I get allergic smelling hay. Ah. So it goes.<br />To all who support Metamorpho-your check is in the mail.<br />To those who don't-a check to the homeless shelter.<br />Have fun!<br /><br />Bossy packs a mean hoove lead! ----------Metamorphoand every time) reflected like sheer aluminum.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|It is just amazing how BBC manages to produce wildlife documentaries of this calibre time and again.  <br />First of all, you will be amazed to know that there is so much of untouched wilderness still out there. But you will also be saddened to know that there is actually nothing that is truly untouched!  <br />The program is divided geographically and shows you some pretty spectacular shots. The aerial shots, in particular, are absolutely amazing. The limit to which the camera men have gone needs to be seen to be believed. <br />The image of the snow leopard hunting in thick snow is something that makes me feel privileged! And if you thought you have seen all there is to see about lions, wait till you see this one! <br />The photography is unbelievable, the sound is awesome, a must watch with the entire family. Certainly a collector’s edition. <br />

1582701709|5.0|My first experience with the Law of Attraction occurred when I read \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" about a decade ago.  One of the stories featured in the book was written by a woman who applied these principles to her life and experienced incredible bounty as a result.  At the time, I wanted desperately to believe that this was possible and that it would work for me.  As usual, though, I did not follow through with making my own \\"Wish Book\\" filled with pictures of my heart's desires.  Needless to say, I forgot all about it in short order. <br /> <br />Then I got an email a few weeks back from a friend of mine, with excerpts from \\"The Secret\\" and its principles and tips.  It got me thinking again, and I was intrigued enough to buy the book in order to learn more. <br /> <br />I was completely blown away by how simple this all seems.  Just visualize and believe? If you see it in your mind it will become reality? How was this even possible? <br /> <br />But then I thought about it in reverse.  What generally caused me to spend my day irritable, stressed and tired? Sure, there was usually an event which would set me off, such as running late or not getting enough sleep.  But then what would I do with that? Instead of putting it behind me and focusing on the positive in my day, I would instead be inclined to focus only on the negative, to only see that which made me unhappy.  I wouldn't bother trying to change my mood or put on a happy face, claiming that I was just \\"not in the mood\\" to try, thinking that was a reasonable excuse.  Before I knew it the entire day would be wasted on negativity and I would be miserable. <br /> <br />The very day I started reading this book I began focusing on the positive aspects of my life.  I made it a point to be kinder to my coworkers, even those I barely know, and found myself feeling more buoyant as a result, right down to the spring in my step, and that lightness of spirit made it possible for me to feel happier.  Whenever something would occur that would normally bring me down, I would remind myself to smile and would instantly feel better, and it would actually become easier to find a solution since I was then in a more positive frame of mind.  I see now how I became far too easily inclined to come up with reasons why things can't be done and I now make it a point to tell myself, right from the get-go, that anything's possible. <br /> <br />I haven't even started any serious visualization yet but can tell you that my outlook, my peace of mind and my life in general have already been changed for the better.  I can't wait to see what's yet to come! I'm finally excited about my life! <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this to anyone who needs a break from the gloom and doom that so many people tend to fall into in this crazy world.  For that alone, it's worth it. <br />
1582701709|2.0|The author of this book has &#34;dumbed down&#34; the concept in order to reach the masses.<br /><br />The author claims to have based her book on ancient texts yet there are no citations or any serious discussions of these texts. If an author claims to have based a book on ancient texts, then showing evidence of that would give credence to the claim. In my world, of being a historian, we have to read the ancient/medieval/early modern texts in the languages they were written in, spend many many years on research, and use extensive training that includes anthropology and ethnography, in order to properly analyze texts from other societies.<br /><br />I would caution a reader not to fooled by her claims about ancient texts. She is not an archaeologist who found a text full of special secrets while doing a dig in Mesopotamia, and she's not a historian of the ancient world who discovered documents full of heretofore unknown secrets in an archive in Rome.  This book is focused on U.S. values, and is slickly marketed.<br /><br />It's good practice of course, to think positively, but senseless crimes like rape, torture & murder happen to GOOD people who are certainly not projecting that they'd like these things to happen to them. I am not saying that the author believes this, but it seems to be a 'take away&#34; that readers are receiving. It is disturbing to see in the reviews that some readers have drawn the conclusion that &#34;rape and murder don't happen&#34; which is similar to the denial of the holocaust. Along those lines, other readers have wondered whether the author believes that had the Jews in WWII just &#34;imagined&#34; a pina colada on the beach, they could have somehow avoided the death camps. It seems that this book needed to make more discernment between the benefits of positive thinking and the danger of thinking that there are no innocent victims of crimes.<br /><br />Lastly, how about less focus on the desire for fancy cars and big houses and more on how a worldwide effort to be more positive and more loving could raise the level of humanity in the world, and perhaps in turn lessen the suffering in the world?world?
B00005JPFQ|1.0|It isn't just that the acting is bad. (Is it ever.) It isn't that the story is idiotic. (Ditto.) And it isn't that the dialog barely resembles how human beings talk. (Sadly, it only occasionally breaks through to \\"it's so bad it's funny\\" terrain.) Taken as a whole, it's hard to imagine a worse superhero movie, and that's taking into account such dreck as The Fantastic Four (both versions) and Daredevil.<br /><br />I don't know what has happened to Nicolas Cage, by the way. I kept thinking of his hideous performance in the remake of The Wicker Man (as close to garbage as a film can get, never mind that it tainted the legacy of the wonderful original version). \\"Ow my legs!!\\" and \\"Not the bees!!!\\" I remember a time when he was actually pretty good (Moonstruck, maybe). He stinks. And even worse is the romantic interest -- the wooden and dopey Eva Mendez. She's one of those people who looks attractive (in a Raquel Welch with silicone kind of way) until she opens her mouth.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't contributed to the grotesquely huge opening weekend for this terrible mess.
B000HT386M|4.0|While I found the movie quite good, I began to think of two things in the movie industry that deeply disturbed me.  The first was Clint Eastwood playing a romantic role in the Bridges of Madison County.  The second is this movie, a serious Adam Sandler movie that has a moral in the plot.<br /><br />When I buy an Adam Sandler movie, I expect a Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or an Anger Management type of mindless comedy.  Watching the previews of \\"Click\\", I thought that this movie was going to be another piece of mindless comedic genius.<br /><br />I found this movie an excellent piece of work and disturbing at the same time.  \\"Click\\" is a movie about an overworked architect named Michael Newman (played by Sandler).  Michael Newman is the perfect example of a middle-aged corporate slave.  He has a beautiful family, but work always seems to get in the way and he never seems to have enough time to play with the kids or spend time with his wife.  In a fit of rage, Newman goes in search of a universal remote control after not being able to figure out what remote controls what.  Newman runs into Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives Newman a Universal Remote (as in a remote that controls the universe).  Newman uses the remote to fast-forward through the seemingly unpleasant portions of life, then finally comes to realize that he missed his whole life.<br /><br />As usual, Christopher Walken is awesome in his portrayal of Morty, a quirky, psychotic techo-geek (plus more).  What I found quite shocking was Sandler's brilliance in the portrayal of Newman, which was actually a serious role.  The comedy in the movie was a definite diversion of the mindless humor I have come to expect of Sandler.  There were some hilarious parts of the movie (the duck and the making of Mike Newman were some of my favorites), but it wasn't the wall-to-wall laughs I was expecting.  Rather, the movie had a very serious theme to it.  As a thirty-something slave to the corporation myself, the movie made me take a step back and review my own life and where I am headed.  As I said before, I felt this was disturbing as I was watching an Adam Sandler film.<br /><br />If you are looking for another Happy Gilmore, this movie isn't it.  I think this is one of those movies that is a compromise between mindless comedy and a chick-flick.  It is a movie to watch with someone you love rather than with a room of drunk friends.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the movie was excellent.

B00005JPCA|5.0|I've never been a big fan of James Bond films but after seeing diehard fans reaction to the selection of Daniel Craig as the new Bond, I thought...hmmm, this guy better do a good job!  And a good job he did!!<br /><br />For me, Craig is perfect for the role.  Charming, ruggedly handsome and a man's man, he pulls off the role as perfectly as Sean Connery.  From the non-stop action at the beginning (an amazing foot chase) to the dramatic game in the casino, this Bond delivers a much needed boost to the franchise.  For the first time in history, I want to own a Bond movie on dvd!!<br /><br />I also enjoyed seeing the origin of James Bond, seeing him become a 007.  And the talented Judi Dench returns as M, a perk for any Bond film.  If you are a Bond film or just enjoy a great action film, this movie is for you!  Highly recommended!
B000FDEU12|5.0|In his latest album \\"Continuo,\\" Avishai Cohen displays virtuosic bass playing and a series of filthy awesome compositions. Although I see where the reviewer who complained of over-repetiveness is coming from, I disagree. Yes, the themes in the songs are repeated, but they change each time in arrangement, tone, and resolution and every single song has quality improvisation.  <br />Sam Barsh (piano), Mark Guiliana (drums, percussion), and Amos Hoffman (oud) all demonstrate remarkable lyricism, deft skill, and incredible musicianship in handling Cohen's twisting time signatures and powerful rhythmic phrases. <br />Also, the compositions in this CD have some of the most emotionally powerful (sometimes almost pump-upish,  sections in any music I've ever heard. The music is always accesible and beautiful, but never at the expense of depth and integrity of composition.  <br />Every single track on this CD is top quality. I highly recommend it.
B00005JOCS|5.0|\\"Dreamgirls\\" is a star vehicle for Beyonce Knowles and co-stars Jaime Foxx, the Oscar winning actor for \\"Ray\\".  But this brilliant musical doesn't belong to either of these two.  It belongs, instead, to Eddie Murphy and newcomer, Jennifer Hudson, who both deserve the stacks of awards that are being awarded them.<br /><br />The story follows the rise of three friends and aspiring singers played by Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, and Jennifer Hudson.  Found by Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jaime Foxx), the girls start out as a backup singer for James \\"Thunder\\" Early (Murphy).  Effie, the curvy and opinionated lead singer uneasily gives up the lead so that the group can get the big break they need.  Along the climb to the top, she begins a romance with Curtis but slowly looses her promised chance for fame to the lesser talented but beautiful and thin, Deena (Knowles). Eventually, betrayed even by her brother, Effie is ousted from the group (branded too troublesome) as it begins its meteoric rise to super stardom.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I was stunned to see it left out of the best picture category of the Academy Awards.  That said, the members of the academy can still right this wrong by giving the best supporting nods (and deservedly so) to Murphy and Hudson.  Hudson, especially, shines as the shunned Effie White, giving a goosebump producing show stopper singing \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\".  Being ousted from American Idol was the best thing ever to happen to the powerhoused voiced Hudson.  Murphy, whose career has been spent entertaining the masses with low brow comedy should finally get the chance to win an Oscar that he might never have thought been possible for him to win.<br /><br />And the soundtrack is perfect, befitting the decades that the group grows through and compliments the film perfectly.  I highly recommend this film to anyone and eagerly look forward to its debut on dvd!
B000JJS8TM|2.0|Before buying, understand you are buying audio ONLY - a stero CD and a 5.1. surround Audio DVD.  We received this as a gift.  We listened to the CD and thought, \\"Okay, this is novel.  George Martin and son must have had a good time cutting and pasting to provide a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil.  Now let's see how it works with the stage show - NOT!  Instead there is a display of a cheezy graphic that is unchanging but for the title of the currently playing track.  I feel badly for the givers of this gift - I don't think they realized either that there would be no visual performance.  Imagine being invited to a wine and cheese party, then being served cheese and shown a picture of a bottle of wine. <br />If you know what you're getting into, fine, but any other CD/DVD combo I've ever purchased has meant a visual performance on the DVD.  They should have been more explicit in their packaging.  Especially since this effort was meant as support to a visual stage show.  It doesn't stand on its own all that well.
B00005JPAM|5.0|Helen Mirren is AMAZING in this film.  You just can't mention this brilliant movie with giving kudos to an actress who steps into the shoes of England's current monarch and makes you believe with such eery success that she IS the Queen.<br /><br />This movie, one of the best of the year, looks at the life of Queen Elizabeth II, during the week of Diana's death.  With Tony Blair as a beginning Prime Minister (and played to perfection by actor Michael Sheen), the Queen tries to deal with the Diana's tragic death and the public's perception of how she should grieve.  Trying to protect Diana's young sons and preferring to hide at Balmoral, the Queen brings about the wrath of her citizens, seemingly acting in a cold and uncaring way to the death of a woman loved world wide.<br /><br />The movie is short and conise: the director concentrating on a dramatic time in the Queen's life, a turning point that perhaps changed the idea of the monarchy for the Queen and her public.  Mirren seems to fall away, becoming a woman who can't understand how she should be forced to deal with such a private matter in public, but eventually surrendering to the will of her people.  I found one scene very interesting, in which she grieves the lost of a brilliant stag, shot on a neighboring territory.  She waves him away, hoping to save him from hunters.  To me, the stag in a sense, was like Diana, beautiful but hunted incessantly.  However, with the stag, it seemed the Queen could grieve much easier and yet found it difficult to deal with the death of her grandchildren's mother.<br /><br />The cast does an incredible job with their roles (James Cromwell is [...]and mean spirited as Prince Philip) and as I mentioned before, Michael Sheen becomes Tony Blair.  The one actor I didn't care for was Alex Jennings who played Prince Charles.  He never seemed to get the mannerisms and character of the Prince of Wales, though the film treats him with sympathy as opposed to the other royals.  Other than that, this movie is deserving of winning the big award, Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />If you enjoy great acting, the royal family or the brilliant Helen Mirren, you must go and see this film.  I look forward to the dvd release of this film!hat, this movie is deserving of winning the big award, Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />If you enjoy great acting, the royal family or the brilliant Helen Mirren, you must go and see this film.

B000K7VHQE|3.0|First, I read the script by Michael Arndt, which I found to be intelligent and interesting; but not great and only marginally funny.<br /><br />Then I watched the movie by husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They added a lot to the script visually; but many of their decisions were based on time and budget constraints, which caused them to pare down some of the more important scenes of the film, making it less impacting. Like the beauty pageant: in the script, it was much bigger, more outlandish and more climactic. Or Frank and Dwayne's trip to the beach: the script had them taking surfboards far out from shore, causing one to wonder what they really had in mind (another suicide attempt?) and coming back wearing \\"Loser\\" T-shirts. The directors pared that down to a trip to the end of a pier. Many of the comic effects (like double-takes and revealing glances) were ignored, and many of the funnier lines were spoken so nonchalantly and sotto voce that they were virtually thrown away.<br /><br />The best character in the story was the yellow VW bus. After that, Abigail Breslin as Olive and Greg Kinnear as Richard were good; Toni Collette as Sheryl and Alan Arkin as Grandpa were okay; Paul Dano and Steve Carell were disappointingly miscast and could have passed as corpses through most of the film. None of these were Oscar-winning performances, nor should this have been a Best Picture nominee. The directors took this script and tried to make it a cross between the outlandishly funny, off-the-wall comedy RAISING ARIZONA, and the more serious black comedy AMERICAN BEAUTY - and it didn't work. What they ended up with was a quirky and weird little film that is fairly entertaining but not particularly funny. I think Hollywood is so enthralled with their own quirkiness and weirdness that they interpret anything quirky and weird as being funny and great entertainment. Now, I like quirky, but I draw the line at weird.<br /><br />What could have been a good story about false values - dividing the world between winners and losers, with child beauty pageants as the example of that idea taken to extremes - ended up getting lost in all the quirkiness and weirdness, time constraints and budget limitations. You know something is wrong when the directors don't know how to end the film. They have four different endings on the DVD, none of them what scriptwriter Michael Arndt had in mind, and none of them good. Some are downright lame. The fact that this film won at Sundance does not make it a great film. Other films have won in the past and gone on to obscurity, among them SPITFIRE GRILL, which in 1996 got tremendous praise but today very few people have even heard of.<br /><br />When films like this get raised to the status of Best Picture Nominee, you know the year was not a particularly good one.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithd story about false values - dividing the world between winners and losers, with child beauty pageants as the example of that idea taken to extremes - ended up getting lost in all the quirkiness and weirdness, time constraints and budget limitations.

B00005JN0T|4.0|The setting of this movie is Chicago in 2035. The skyline shows the Sears Tower along with a new, taller, cone-shaped building. Cars still exist but are now largely driven automatically along the highway at great speeds. Robots do all of the menial work that humans did in the past. A robot is even shown carrying a woman's purse.<br /><br />There are three Laws of Robot Behavior, based on Isaac Asimov's ideas: 1). Robots cannot harm people nor do anything that would cause harm to humans, 2). Robots must obey all human commands, except those that would violate Law #1, and 3). Robots can protect themselves from harm, except when doing so would violate Rule #1 or Rule #2.<br /><br />This film contains profanity. There are also a few bloody scenes of a suicide or murder victim. There are graphic, creative scenes of robot combat and robotic attacks on humans.<br /><br />The investigator has doubts about the suicidal nature of the robot originator's death. The safety glass through which the victim crashed, before falling from a considerable height to his death, is very thick and not easily broken. He suspects that robots have somehow circumvented Law #1 and killed this person, but no one will believe him at first.<br /><br />It takes some time for the truth to come out. Belatedly, some humans suspect that unintended consequences in the function of the robot brain have enabled some robots to acquire the ability to disobey the Laws, and, in effect, to have a form of free will. But further investigation demonstrates that the Laws are still inviolable. It turns out that the robots had evolved their understanding of the three Laws. They now can harm individual people if it causes a benefit to the human race as a whole. In effect, the robots, aware that humans cause such things as wars, are attempting a takeover of the human race, as they are now saving the human race from itself. This is an obvious satire of human behavior.<br /><br />No human wants to be ruled by robots, even ostensibly benevolently-motivated ones. Will the robot takeover succeed? How can it even be stopped at this point? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.uled by robots, even ostensibly benevolently-motivated ones. Will the robot takeover succeed?

0380789035|2.0|OK. I know this book has won just about all the big awards, but I found it to be nearly a plotless meandering that I had to work at to finish. I enjoyed Gaiman's run on Sandman a long time ago, but I don't think I'm a fan of his more recent work, both the Eternals and 1602 made me yawn. This book as well; it's more like a bunch of short stories loosely woven together. I'm not a fan of short stories, so it didn't work for me.

1582701709|2.0|While I basically agree with what a lot of the one star reviews say(with regard to its marketing and it's misrepresentation as a secret, particularly), I think that if someone feels drawn to buy The Secret, they should. After all, the paths to the Mountain are myriad and, for some, The Secret represents a trail head. I remember when I first became aware of being on The Path at an early age, I read a lot of books that wouldn't much interest me today. I think the same may be true for many, years after reading The Secret.<br /><br />My main caution with The Secret (I watched the DVD and browsed the book), is that The Secret gets the so-called 'law' of attraction wrong. Mick, Keith and the boys got it right 40-some years ago when they sang, \\"You can't always get what you want, but if you try, sometimes, you get what you need.\\"<br /><br />In my experience, what we draw to ourselves is what we need to further our own evolution toward real and abiding happiness (which only comes with a visceral understanding of our oneness with 'God'). This doesn't always correspond to what we wish. That which we draw to ourselves are lessons, not wishes.<br /><br />I note that the DVD of The Secret extensively uses the image of the Universe as a genie which endlessly grants your wishes (if you only would visualize and feel what you want properly). But this is a cartoon image of the traditional folklore of the Djinn. Many of the tales of the Djinn were cautionary tales along the lines of \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" Wishes are like that. Because we live in a consumerist culture, we are conditioned from early on to believe that it's money, cars, houses, etc. that will make us happy. But the wealthiest among us --I know quite a few-- are not. It is like Jesus said, \\"It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to pass into the kingdom of heaven.\\"<br /><br />My hope is that those who feel drawn to read The Secret or view the DVD will not find disappointment when everything they wish for doesn't come true and make them happy and turn away from some of the very valid lessons it presents. My sincerest hope is that it functions for what it is - a trail head to a deeper pursuit of truth.isappointment when everything they wish for doesn't come true and make them happy and turn away from some of the very valid lessons it presents.

B00002Z88D|5.0|Why in the world would anyone say to get rid of the orchestra in this album?! This is a definite keeper. I have owned this album for over six years now and it is still up there as one of my all-time favourites, especially in regards to metallica! it really is incredible! It sounds much better with the orchestra because they add an element that can't be compared to anything else. I like all of the songs better with the SFO. Wonderfully produced, sounds great and hard to beat! One of the most solid and respected albums in my collection. I love it!

B00008AWNY|5.0|This is a classic album that every music fan must have!  It stands up to the test of time in terms of it's precision, depth, and mastery of musical emotion.  As for the critics (one in particular):  How can someone even mention any album by the bands Metallica, Green Day, REM, etc. in the same conversation with DSOTM?!?!  Get real - Mettalica is (at best) a 3-chord repetition; Green Day, a juvenile shouting match; and REM a lame rehash of new-wave music.  If you like Rock in most any form - Dark Side of the Moon is for you.
B00005MP58|3.0|It's a ok kinda movie. The cast was alittle less than desirable. Colin Firth is no Matthew Macfadyen. Stick with the 2005 movie.
B000M341QE|5.0|This film is excellent. I am a native Bostonian, and I sat in the theater watching this movie in Oregon, listening to a bunch of left coast people talk about how bad the accents were. Being something of an authority on the subject, I have to tell you folks, for the most part, the accents are pretty spot on. What most people think is a Boston accent is what is off. The accents also ranged from Southie to the Cape to Lynn, which I thought was pretty cool.<br /><br />As far as the content of the movie, I really enjoyed it. The premise was interesting, the excecution easy to follow, and the acting pretty damn good. DiCaprio was suprisingly believable as a North Shore oxy-addict, and Nicholson did a pretty impressive Whitey Bulger impression.<br /><br />If you like Scorsese movies, or films about the mob, you should really see this movie.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|As police thrillers go, \\"The Departed\\" ain't bad.  The script is intelligent and twisty, and the Boston ambience (as far as this New Yorker is concerned) is an interesting change.  Damon and DiCaprio are terrific, as always, and there's good supporting work by Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen.  But Nicholson's doing a Nicholson imitation and he wears out his welcome awfully fast.  Vera Farmagi, as talented as she is, is miscast as the romantic interest; she seems too old and matronly to attract either guy's attentions.  And in spite of the Oscar nomination, I think Wahlberg's way over the top (but not in a good way).  On the whole, the testosterone runs just a little too high throughout most of the film.  There's none of the nuance and subtlety one expects from a Scorsese film.  (Nicholson playing with a dismembered hand is just one example of the...uh, heavy-handedness.)  And the film's final shot is simply unworthy of a filmmaker of Scorses's caliber.  But you'll never be bored, and you might even be surprised now and then.  When was the last time you felt that way about a film that's ultimately disposable?
B00007BH3Y|4.0|I had heard one song from this movie on the radio and really liked it.  It seems this cd is that one song played different ways and so its like you are listening to 45 minutes of pretty much the same song.  Its nice, but not what I was expecting.
0393327655|2.0|I am a Christian.  I am a former atheist and am used to argumentation for and against Christianity. <br /> <br />His arguments against several of the tenets of Christianity are weak and betray, at best, a superficial knowledge of the topic.  <br /> <br />That is not to say that one cannot make many valid arguments against the Christian faith and against religion. It's just that he doesn't make them. At least as regards Chrisitanity, he presumes too many false premises to come up with a valid argument. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a witty, sound-bite analysis of Christianity, you will find that in this book.  If you are looking for a book that critiques Christianity in an erudite way, this is not that book. <br /> <br />Personally, a reasoned discussion of the failings of Christianity is something I would appreciate and enjoy.  We all have much to learn.  But Sam just does not appear to have done his homework in getting to know his topic.
B00005JPFO|4.0|Upon first starting to watch this movie the first thing that may come to mind is that it is cheesy.  Then you remember that it is based on a comic book.  The over the top acting and the feel is fully intended.  It is much along the same feel as of the Spiderman movies.  Keeping this in mind you can kick back and enjoy another tale of a superhero, a very different superhero.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze sells his soul to save his father's life.  Later in life he is called upon to pay his debt and become the Ghost Rider, but Johnny is not evil and he uses his new found powers for good.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic.  The story is very good (I am not well versed in the original comic book story so this did not take anything away from the movie for me).  It was great to see Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot on the screen again; they bring credibility to any movie.  This is definitely one to see, and judging by the packed theatre it is going to be huge.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. This is the best studio album that IM has put out---ever. Dickinson's voice is better than ever, there isn't a single weak track on the album and the thick riffs set a new standard. After they put out a dissapointment like Dance of Death, I thought there was no way they could come back strong. I was wrong. This is a new direction for IM and I can't wait to see where it takes them. Let's hope we don't have to wait three more years for the next studio album.

B000B6CODO|5.0|This came home at the behest of my older son, who saw the trailer on another DVD.  I had avoided this movie when it came out, dismissing it as fare for kids (and I had none at the time), However, in the midst of all the mindless stuff the media releases in the guise of 'family entertainment,' this thoughtful yet thrilling movie is the real deal. <br /> <br />When 12 year old Allan Parrish shouts to his father that he \\"will never speak to him again!\\" he has no idea that he is about to (literally) get sucked into a board game that will leave him vanished without a trace, his friend Sarah traumatized at having bore witness to his disappearance, and the disintegration of his own family's fortunes as a result. <br /> <br />When Judy and Peter find the board game and unwittingly bring Allan back 26 years later, it's up to Allan to understand the consequences of his actions to put right everything that has gone wrong. <br /> <br />There are a great many teachable moments in this breath-taking movie, and you don't have to look too hard for them, either. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and I found myself enjoying it right along with them--a rare treat! Highly recommended.
0670038040|5.0|Here is another fine novel from John Mortimer chronicling the life and times of Horace Rumpole, London barrister and scourge of tyrants, idiots, sycophants, and incompetents.  This time, Rumpole must deal with the aftereffects of the War on Terror, particularly the Blair Government's sorry efforts to limit or efface hundreds of years of British common law safeguards against wrongful arrest and imprisonment.  He is the advocate for a Pakistani resident of London who has fallen afoul of anti-terrorism laws and might be deported to his native land, where he will definitely be imprisoned and tortured or executed because he believes in democracy. (Which the anti-terrorist laws being lampooned are supposedly designed to safeguard in the first place!)  Its a situation ripe for Rumpole, and he is at his best here, deflating egos and probing weak spots right and left to ultimately triumph, at least partially and only for a moment, but nevertheless triumph.<br /><br />All of the tried and true Rumpole characters are here: She Who Must Be Obeyed (who gets her own point of view across several times), the-always- on-the-wrong-side-of-the-law Timson clan, the utterly incompetent ninnies Sam Ballard and Claude Erskine-Brown, and all the rest.  If one takes Rumpole at his word that he was about 60 when his chronicles began back in the 1970s he must now be a nonagenarian, but he remains as ageless and active as ever.  I hope we will see many more of his cases in the future (perhaps he can get a license to practice US law and take on the Bush Administration and the Patriot Act next!)
B000M5AJQS|4.0|If you're looking for something uplifting, or a Bruce-Willis-style action movie, pass this one up.  Great performances by Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio put a lot of oomph into this movie. I noticed other reviewers suggested this was a knock-off of Infernal Affairs. I've never seen that so can't comment. It seemed to me this one had a perspective similar to Training Day - an official, bright, this-is-the-way-things-work and a much darker this-is-the-way-things-really-work reality.
B000000YG5|5.0|Giving this album a rating is like trying to rate the Mona Lisa.  It's an unmistakable masterpiece.  Listen to it and I challenge you to not be swept up in the envelope of that sound.  Reflective melancholy, exuberant joy, each melody a story told with an attitude...or a sense of humour. It's all here.  Rollins sings through his horn while the rhythm section lays it down and you are enraptured.    Whenever someone I know says they can't get into jazz, this is the album I play to open their ears.  Whenever I'm down in the dumps, this is the album I listen to to lift my spirits.    Saxophone Collossus is one of the greatest albums of any genre.  I've been listening to it for the better part of twenty-five years.  It's part of my nervous system.  I wouldn't want to be without it.
B00000JR2A|2.0|Out of the trio of albums Tears for Fears completed in 80's before they split, 'Seeds of Love' stands out to me as by far the weakest. TFF started out in 'The Hurting' as a synth band comparable to Depeche Mode or New Order, and while they were always making pop music, the instrumentation they used provided a unique, creative, and interesting sound. While the singles from Songs from the Big Chair were huge pop hits, TFF continued to create interesting sounds via a combination of synths, samples, and real instruments. Songs on that album like \\"Listen\\", \\"The Big Chair\\", and \\"Empire Building\\" were instrumentals and blatantly abandoned radio-friendliness in favor of creativity. <br /> <br />In 'Seeds of Love', the dark lyrics and interesting synth sounds that defined Tears for Fears seem completely absent. By comparison to their previous albums, Seeds of Love feels like \\"easy listening\\". TFF touches on some interesting beats in a few songs, but these introductions quickly give way to cheesy, traditional, over-produced pop sounds. <br /> <br />The album's title track, \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\", summarizes in one song the entire direction of the album (as compared to TFF's previous work) quite accurately. Listen to this song; if you enjoy its' uncomplicated traditional pop quality, then you may well like the whole album. However, if you're like me and \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" strikes you as too poppy, too cheesy, and lacking the interesting sounds that made other TFF tracks enjoyable, then don't buy the album; the rest is just as bad, albeit less catchy. <br /> <br />If you ask me, 'Elemental', the first album made after the break up, sounds like a more appropriate follow-up to 'Songs from the Big Chair' and 'The Hurting' than 'The Seeds of Love.'

B000LE0THO|5.0|One of ELO's finest albums gets a terrific, deluxe reissue that recalls the original vinyl 2 album release. The packaging on the outside looks like a bit like a hardcover book (similar looking to David Gilmour's \\"On An Island\\" album). Inside we get an expanded booklet with notes on the making of the album. We also get the punch outs that you could use to make the ELO spaceship as with the original release (except this time I'm not going to be punching out them). Naturally, it's not quite as large as the original pop out ship--it's sized to fit inside the booklet. We get terrific photos from the tour that supported this album as well. Lynne also provides ancedotes about the making of the album and a couple of amusing stories about the tour.<br /><br />This is one of ELO's most infectious albums and while it may lack some of the more experimental touches on the band's first three albums, there are plenty of melodic experiments here such as the sythesizer driven \\"The Whale\\". \\"Turn to Stone\\" has never sounded so good on CD before. While the band would continue to put out hits after this, \\"Out of the Blue\\" captured the band at a commerical and artistic climax. They never got better than this! Be aware that there is a minor tape drop out on one track (\\"It's Over\\") which I'm surprised wasn't caught prior to issuing the CD. They could have digitally repaired it.<br /><br />We get three bonus tracks. The first is an alternate bridge for the song \\"Wild West Hero\\" and runs about 24 seconds. The second is an unfinished instrumental \\"The Quick and the Daft\\" that runs under a minute and a half. The last is \\"Latitude 88 North\\" which Lynne finished for this reissue. It's a terrific song that would have fit in well with the rest of the album. I'm glad that Lynne went back to finish it as it makes a fitting finish to a terrific album.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the disc slides into the packaging which increases chances of it getting scratched (mine had some minor scratches on it but nothing to effect the quality of the music (it just makes the surface of the disc look rough). Other than that the packaging is nicely designed. I'm not sure why they didn't include one of those little spindles like the Gilmour CD to hold the CD in the case and not damage it.<br /><br />I have heard that the first Japanese pressing of this sounds better than this one but I can't compare it as I've only had the US CD issued over a decade ago. It compares favorably to the origina vinyl version. According to audio remastering engineer Steve Hoffman (at his forum), this is the best sounding of the editions released on CD and also sounds the closest to the original mastertapes of all the previous releases.on it but nothing to effect the quality of the music (it just makes the surface of the disc look rough).

B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer has exceeded expectations yet again in this his third album, Continuum.  This album stands out from his other two in that it has a more blues and slow rock sound than the more pop sound in his first two releases.  He has also hit core issues dealing with the direction of our country and the chaos in our world and also the chaos one has to deal within our own personal relationships.  This album expands your mind to in dealing with everyday issues and to get motivated to make changes in the right direction. <br />The two songs that I personally favor on this album are the first track, Waiting on the World to Change and Slow Dancing in a burning room.  These songs deal with two totally different subjects but both get their messages clear in their lyrics. Waiting on the World to Change starts out in the first chorus stating how my generation is made to feel that we don't care what is happening with what is going on in our country and could care less in how to make a difference.   It strikes a \\"Dixie Chicks\\" chord in your body when you hear the lyrics,  <br />\\"now if we had the power  <br />to bring our neighbors home from war  <br />they would have never missed a Christmas  <br />no more ribbons on their door  <br />and when you trust your television  <br />what you get is what you got  <br />cause when they own the information, oh  <br />they can bend it all they want\\" <br />The meaning in the words of this song are inspiring and motivational. They make me wanna stand up in what I believe in even if it is not what others around me believe to be true because of what they have been told. As he also states: <br /> <br />\\"One day our generation  <br />is gonna rule the population\\" <br />  <br />So it is now time to make a difference.  My other favorite song on this album is Slow dancing in a burning room.  This song deals with the impending break up of a failed relationship.  It tells the tale of how when two people know that their relationship is coming to an end and how two people hurt each other by staying together even though they both know they shouldn't be together. <br />John Mayer as an artist is changing and evolving with each release.  When he released his first album he was compared to the sounds of Dave Matthews.  He is like Dave in that his lyrics have deep meaning and that people are drawn by his presence.  John Mayer stands out because in all three albums the entire albums are great pieces of music.  He is not an artist that is about all the hype.  By listening to his music you can tell that he writes and sings about things that matter and that everyone can relate to.  At his concerts John gets the crowd involved and almost everyone knows every word to all his songs.  In his first single, No Such Thing, he stated that he wanted to everyone to know what all this time was for, I think we know now. He is a great artist who I look forward to see what he will put out next.  <br />

0618680004|5.0|Superbrain and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has once again directed his clear light of reason into the murk of superstition, ignorance and fanaticism that calls itself 'organized religion'.  In lucid and simple language, Dawkins discusses and demolishes most of the commonly held --- but widely misunderstood --- concepts of God, morality, abortion, intelligent design, atheism, faith, and the labeling and education of children.  Along the way, he also illustrates, yet again, the truly amazing processes of evolution and natural selection.  If you want reason and common sense, read Dawkins.  If you want superstition and nonsense, read any of the world's many religious texts that claim to be penned by God. --- Russ Heitz, Sarasota, Florida
0440237688|4.0|I had the pleasure of reading this novel for an on line class that deals with Myths, Magic, and Folklore. This novel, to me, is an excellent read. It's about a boy who lives in a seemingly perfect community. In this particular town, everyone is given a role that is vital to the welfare of the community, be that doctors or lawyers. This boy, Jonas, is given the assignment to be the Receiver of memories from the Giver. The Giver is an old, but very bright man who seems to be wary with his old age and the things he's had to remember. Jonas and the Giver share a special relationship due to the fact that they're the only two people in their community who know about the past. In the end, Jonas must run away from the town when he finds out that the doctors of the town have been practicing euthanasia on some of it's \\"unworthy\\" citizens. The fate of the boy is left unclear, and the ending to the story depends on the readers' concept of the book.  <br /> <br />    The reason why my classmates were asked to read this novel is because of its' message that the Oral Tradition is very important on any culture. The only way that the Giver can share his memories with Jonas is by hand, not by reading anything to him. The boy and the Giver also share a very special bond, and this shows how strong a connection can be when the Oral Tradition method is used.   <br /> <br />    I gave this novel four out of five stars because I thought it was a little too short for its' subject matter. Overall, it's a very interesting novel and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction or controversial literature. <br />

B00003CX9S|5.0|I first saw The Elephant Man on HBO in 1981 at 10:30 in the morning.  Everyone in my family wanted to know why I was crying after it was over.  I told them they had to see it themselves so we watched it again at 8:00 that night.  When it was over my mother and I were crying outright and my dad and brother had tears in their eyes.  We had a long discussion about what it must have been like for John Merrick, wanting only to be like other people but knowing that it would never happen.  The movie had such a profound effect on me.  I bagan to view other people in a different light and came to see people for what they were like on the inside, not the outside.  This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  The actors, especially John Hurt, are brilliant.  The use of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings was inspired.  I still can't hear that piece of music without crying (while watching a British memorial service for the 9/11 victims they played this song.)  I feel very sorry for anyone who watches this remarkable movie and comes away untouched.  It has a deep message that all of us should embrace.
B000000YG5|5.0|This cd of Sonny Rollins is the second jazz cd I have ever purchased.  I bought it along with Louis Armstrong, The Definitive Collection. <br /> <br />As I stated in my review of Louis' cd, I am a hard core rock 'n roll/heavy metal girl and have never intentionally listened to jazz before...but I think I'm hooked now!  I listened to samples of a LOT of albums before I made this purchase, and Sonny's music reeled me in like no other, with the exception of Louis. <br /> <br />After listening to this cd, I am going to look for more of Sonny's albums to buy.  I'm sure his music can turn anyone into a jazz fan...it did me, and that's quite an amazing feat!
B00009NHC5|5.0|This isn't Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Neither is it Nightmare on Elm St.  But Wait Until Dark, starring Audrey Hepburn, is truly chilling.  Hepburn plays a blind lady who, through the circumstances of the plot, is pitted against a dangerous criminal and his two henchmen.  She slowly realizes she is in danger and, after smashing the lights in to level the playing field, must struggle for her life in her apartment.  More along the lines of a thriller like Pyscho than a horror film, Wait Until Dark is scary, but classy.
B0000029LG|4.0|How many times people have to pay for Michael Jackson greatest hits album? Come on this should have been a single disc album. I already bought all of his old albums! Anyway I review the new songs there. <br />I liked They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow, Earth Song, You Are Not Alone, Come Together, and Little Susie. They are all excellent tracks and I enjoyed them greatly. Scream, This Time Around, History, 2 Bad, and Smile are all average songs acceptable as filler       <br />D.S., Money, Childhood , and Tabloid Junkie are very much junk.  <br />Please Michael we all know you need privacy and tabloids are not treating you right and you had a \\"bad\\" childhood. I am sick and tired of hearing these type of songs over and over which are similar to old ones. So please stop nagging and make unique music <br />
0393327655|3.0|I'm considered a \\"conservative\\" Christian.  I attend one of the more conservative Lutheran seminaries in North America.  That being said, I'm not one to shy away from other viewpoint.  I may not always agree, but I want to understand where you are coming from.  This is why I bought the book.  I enjoyed the book, but not for the reasons you might expect. <br />I enjoyed reading the book because it helps me understand why people would want religion is fade away.  It helps me understand why they want faith to give way to logic and proof.  If I had an understanding of religion, as the author did, I too would hope for an \\"End of Faith\\".  The problem is, he simply doesn't understand what faith is to a Christian.  He makes rules that Christians must follow, otherwise, they aren't true Christians.  An example, \\"A literal reading of the Old Teastament not only permits, but requires heretics to be put to death (82)\\" and earlier he quotes the book of Deuteronomy when it refers to putting people to death and then he says, \\"The above passage is as canonical as any in the Bible, and it is only by ignoring such barbarisms that the Good Book can be reconciled with life in the modern world (18).\\" <br />To say such things is to reveal a lack of understanding of Christ, the Gospels, and the Pauline Epistles.  Paul clearly teaches in the New Testament that the law of Moses is no longer bound to us who have faith in Christ (see Galatians as a primary example).  So, even though the author claims to have \\"studied Eastern and Western religions\\", I question his sources.  A BASIC knowledge of the New Testament refutes his requirements that Christians must live by the laws of Moses.   <br />The author is not content with dismissing religion, he hopes for persecution.  \\"Faith based religion must slide into obsolescence (14).  I hope to show that the very ideal of religious tolerance - born of the notion that every human being should be free to believe whatever he wants about God - is one of the principle forces driving us toward the abyss (15).\\", he says.  So, for those of you who are hoping for freedom of religion, in this man's world, forget it.  You must believe in his doctrine of logic - nothing else. <br />What are his cases against relgion?  He uses the inquisition and the holocost as primary examples.  No offense, but this is like saying Ted Bundy represents North Americans.  The author loses credibility when he takes the worst examples and props them up as the poster children for faith.  Yes, no one is arguing that humans can get religion wrong, but that's a human fault, not a religious one.  The author disagrees, he says the horrors of man are the fault of their religion.  He states, \\"Before you can get to the end of this paragraph, another person will probably die because of what someone else believes about God (77)\\"  Hmmm, that's true, and another person will die because they don't believe in God.  His point is weak at best.  Humans kill because humans are misguided, but the author wants to lay the full blame on a belief in God.  It's weak and I admit, laughable. <br />His argument is that religious people are \\"mad\\".  The only thing that keeps us from being labeled crazy is the numbers, but he wonders - Is ther any doubt that a lone subscriber to the idea that the body and blood of Jesus Christ are in the bread and wine would be mad? (73)  Yes, Christians, he thinks you are crazy, yet he doesn't explain how crazy people can love one another, care for their children, work a steady job, and be leaders in society. After all, he states, Christians have no evidence for their beliefs - how can we honestly know if Jesus was born of a virgin?  (77) And I would ask how can we honestly know if Descartes sat in front of a fire?  It was written ;)  This is what is so comical and what had me laughing, he says the fault of people of faith is that stupidly, what we hold \\"sacred is not sacred for any reason other than it was thought sacred yesterday!\\"  So, I've got news for you, if you subscribe to the author's argument, you can forget what you believed yesterday because that's weak grounds for a belief.  Believe that your mom is a good person?  Forget about it, that was yesterday, today's a new ballgame.  <br />So, why all the effort?  What's his agenda?  It finally comes out in scary and flying colors.  He supports legalized drugs, abortion on deman, stem-cell research, prostitution (or anything else that doesn't harm anyone).  The list goes on, and on, and on.  It's an agenda of pleasure.  He's a hedonist.  I don't fault him for being one, I just wish he would have made it known from the beginning, because the entire book seems to serve his desire for us all to live according to our fleshly desires.  Sorry, I don't have enough faith in your message to follow. <br />I enjoyed the book because it showed me that people really haven't changed.  I thought this would be groundbreaking, but it merely tells me, more than ever, God's love is needed in this world.  If we walk away from the gift of faith in God, we are left worshipping the vices of this world.  The author embraces the most evil of them, sadly.  It's a good lesson for us all. <br />If atheists can please remember that faith is not a choice, it is a gift from God, then maybe they will stop looking at Christians as people who choose a destiny and instead, see them as people who have been chosen.  We all have been chosen - unfortunately, there are those who reject what has been given to them and write books about the End of their Faith. <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles Abbey Road is my fave from The Beatles incredible, impressive work. I love this album so much. Paul is the genius behind this project. I never get sick of hearing The Medley, Carry That Weight is a clear standout and so is She Came in Through the Bathroom Window. Oh! Darling and You Never Give Me your Money are the best songs on the first side of the album. Of course John and George have amazing tracks as well, the beautiful Here Comes the Sun and Because.  This was my mom's favorite album growing up as well. I am a recent fan of The Beatles and I tend to be one for the rest of my life. Get this groundbreaking album today! I also recommend Sgt. Pepper and Revolver.

0553801503|5.0|Why all the negative reviews?  Maybe it's because we're finding it so very hard to trust any author of the bajillion page, decades-in-the-making series because of the way we've been cheated by Robert Jordan and his ilk.  Perhaps it comes from the \\"me\\" generation attitude of entitlement, the I'd-rather-play-my-PSP-for-two-minutes-than-chance-getting-bored-waiting-for-the-stoplight people who demand to be entertained every waking minute of their lives, and whose idea of entertainment involve three things: 1. action, 2. action, 3. MORE ACTION.   Probably a combination of both.   After I was well into A Storm of Swords, I read many of the negative reviews for A Feast for Crows, and I'll admit to being worried that Martin was pulling a Jordan on us because (I'm now telling myself): how can any author really sustain such an incredibly rich and diverse storyline as A Song of Ice and Fire?  It's impossible, isn't it?  Well, with so much time invested in the first three books, I felt I had to press on, and the books up to that point had certainly given me no reason to hold back. <br /> <br />So is Feast a bloated, over-written, under-edited throw-away as many of the previous Amazon would-be-literary-critics state?  ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Of course we won't be able to put it in it's proper context until the final book is read, but nothing in Feast made me doubt it is any less essential than the three preceding books.  And it certainly was no less enjoyed by myself, having devoured it at the same frenetic pace as those previous tomes (once again spending time reading when I should have been sleeping because, dammit, I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!).  Rest assured that Martin does not cheat with Feast. Every detail is important and is another critical piece in the Ice and Fire puzzle.  While it isn't as chock-full of action as its predecessors, I daresay its treasures are better, if more subtle.  If you are a fan of the Ice and Fire series to this point, you must read this book, and youwon't be sorry. <br /> <br />So, is it possible for Martin to sustain this incredible storyline, and will the pay-off at the end be worth it?  Who knows?  For the answers, we'll have to obviously wait until the end.  All I can tell you is nothing I read in A Feast for Crows made me believe they won't fulfill their promise.  I'm still excited, I'm still hooked, and the only cure will be the next books.  Don't believe the storm crows.  Get the book. Read it.  Love it!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. The plot is captivating and the continious usage of flashbacks give it a unique character as the viewer sees two stories evolving at the same time that are interrelated.  But what really elevates this film are the acting, directing and photography thatare all tied together by the spectacular music score. <br />There are two love stories that evolve pre second WWII and during it that bring different charcters together. Saying more would ruin it for those who have not seen it yet. Buy it and enjoy it over and over again

B0000025DD|3.0|It does not deserve a five stars, I would give it to \\"Wish you were here\\" for instance.  It is not a four stars also, this kind of rating would go to album like \\"A momentary lapse of reason\\" The conclusion, each of these are greater albums than David's first solo effort.  One thing is clear, remember that this album has been issued between \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\" <br />It is clear to me that David, with this album, is showing that he is not the genious for the Floyd's, this title defineately goes to Roger. <br />Overall, a good cd, not a masterpiece (five stars) and not close to it (a four star, so this one deserve a three stars, but it is a good album after all.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|I have to give the director, producers, actors, and screen writers credit for taking on an ambitious project that is destined not to please everyone. There are both strengths and weaknesses to the film.<br /><br />First, the strengths, of which there are many. The film does a relatively admirable job of portraying historic events, while maintaining the pace of an action thriller, while integrating thoughtful dialogue regarding the cyclic nature of revenge. The events at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich were shocking and stunned the world. The Black Sunday group, associated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, conduct a kidnapping and mass murder in front of the entire world. The film does an exceptional job of capturing this horrific series of events. The film also does an admirable job of capturing the political dialogue between Golda Meir and her cabinet after the events. The cast is exceptional with Eric Bana playing Avner, the assassin, with considerable depth and skill. Bana's performance was superb. Avner is joined by a team of collegues who help him track down 9 of the 11 terrorists or those who planned the event. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Ephraim, the team's only contact with the Israelis. Daniel Craig as Steve and Ciaran Hinds as Carl are outstanding. The French informant, Louis, played by the French actor Mathieu Amalric, is great. The dialogue is excellent, much of it written by the very talented Tony Kushner. It is the dialogue that is interwoven with the action sequences that pushes the film to a higher motive. The scene where Eric Bana, acting as if he is a German, dialogues with a young Palestinian about the claiming of Israel by both the Jews and the Palestinians. Of course this is no James Bond thriller where everything goes as planned. In fact, nothing really goes as planned  and it is the unexpected that gives the film tension. However the most outstanding change in plot occurs when the team realizes that they may be the hunters but someone is hunting them!<br /><br />There were two issues that kept me from giving the film 5 stars. First, the writers decided not to get into a messy group of hundreds of informers and contacts and instead decided to write the story as if some French underground family supplied the team the names, addresses, and iteneraries of all the major PLO terrorist leadership. Whereas this certainly simplified the story, it certainly seems beyond belief. It appeared to be a literary license the screen writers took to cover up hundreds of persons who were involved in this series of revenge killings across Europe. My second criticism is the flashbacks that Avner has throughout the film of the actual events in Munich. Whereas this worked well to continually remind the viewer of the reasons this team is hunting down the PLO planners, leaders, and soldiers; it reached the point of overkill when Avner flashes back to the final minutes where the athletes were killed in the two  helicopters. Avner has this flashback while having intercourse with his wife so that the moment of death for the Israeli athletes corresponds with Avner's orgasm. What is the point here? I interpreted this that despite the murder of Jews, they will continue to thrive, defend themselves, and will successfully survive on this earth despite the hatred and prejudice.<br /><br />At 2 hours and 44 minutes, it is a long film, but will keep you engaged every second!
B000MCH5P4|1.0|The worst movie I ever saw in my life. I want the 2 hrs of my life back. It was pointless and made no sense. I wouldn't even give it one star.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I just discovered Corinne Bailey Rae and I was really missing out. If she comes to Tampa for a concert I'm going this is my type of music. She has a truely unique style, that nobody should compare her with anyone. Mellow, soulful, and don't forget lyrics that have meaning. You won't regret getting this CD. I enjoyed every song! Haven't experienced this since Alicia Keys!
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I think this best describes Marillion. They have the David Gilmour type solos, the Neil Finn-like singing, the Pink Floyd minor key tinged songs and epics and the Crowded House melodies. My advice is to skip the domestic US release and get the double CD import. To fully enjoy this CD, one must listen to the song \\"Ocean Cloud,\\" which is only available on the import. Great album, great band.

B000H5TVO4|3.0|Like many former superstar acts, Roxette has taken to living off its past. \\"A Collection of Hits\\" is the duo's fourth greatest hits package in the past 12 years and third compilation since 2002. That makes this set less than worthwhile for fans who own the others, especially \\"The Ballad Hits\\" and \\"The Pop Hits.\\" If you own those two albums, you won't need this new one (every hit song on this disc is covered by the others), unless you've 'just gotta have' the two new tracks featured on \\"Collection.\\" <br /> <br />Speaking of the new cuts -- \\"One Wish\\" and \\"Reveal\\" are nothing stellar; they're passable fare, but you can save a bit of money by buying (and downloading) them through an online vendor. <br /> <br />However, \\"A Collection of Hits\\" is a great buy for the casual Roxette fan, or that person who stopped following them after their early 90s heyday in America. Unlike \\"Ballad\\" and \\"Pop\\" from a few years ago, \\"Collection\\" features only their best-known numbers from the past 20 years. If you've never looked into Roxette and want to see what the rest of the world has appreciated for two decades, grab this disc. Otherwise, pony up the extra cash for the more-complete, earlier greatest hits collections.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I bought this DVD for a party I was having, and I've now watched it a dozen times.  The quality is outstanding, the Eagles are better than ever, they play ALL the songs we remember and love, their harmonies remain the smoothest and most melodic of any band I know, and they're consummate entertainers.  They are truly one of the greatest bands of our time, and this DVD reminds us of why they are still so acclaimed today.  I recommend it 1000%!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|When I was a kid I went with my family to a small town where a new multi theater (at that time still in construction) opened with Star Wars. From that point it became my favorite movie. After a couple of years, for the Christmas / New Year / Three king's holidays they showed the movie on TV, so it was the next few years. However the TV versions, nowadays know as the original versions were slightly different from the movies I saw at the theater. So was the story from the comics we got back then. The edition on the theater was larger, though I cannot be precise on how much longer it was, I can remember scenes that I didn't seen on TV, like the one when Luke encounters Biggs before the final battle. Which didn't came back until the special edition, but it was on the original theatrical version I saw late '77 / early '78 (when it was show at San Juan del Rio, Qro. Mex.). Back then it make sense that to fit the movie + advertisement into 2 hrs. (later on 2,5 hrs as the TV people got greedier) time some cutting was necessary. But it was this new version that became something like the \\"standard\\" original version. <br /> <br />Also it was this version the one available for rent when so. Additionally there were some scenes larger that the \\"standard original\\" and I can only think, as this is not unique to this movie, that distribution of movies back on the `70s was not as organized as today's and some versions which where not the final cut got away to be on time \\"somewhere\\" I got the luck of seen a more complete, not as cut-off version back then. Adding this to the comic's version where even scenes like the one in which Han meets Java (still humanoid of course) made me had a wider sense of the story. So the special edition was not a surprise but another version. I wonder if there would be a time when a \\"complete original version\\", with all cut-off scenes included, ever will be available.

I mena I read about the defeat of Mengde (Cao Cao) at Red Cliffs, I red about the Death of Kongming (Zhuge Liang) with great sadness.  I efinately recommend this novel to anyone.  Even if they don't like histoy, they should still find theis to be a great read.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the coolest Bond ever. He is tough and all male... he is a Bond thug... he is so proud of his buff bod... finds every chance to show it including a nude torture scene where Le Chiffre compliments him. The plot is tight... the explotions are Lethal Weapon. This is Bond playing homage to similar action flicks like Lethal Weapon, Bourne series. It is great now that flim producers try to revamp long movies series starting with Batman. With the Craig Bond, kid you have many more to go.. and we will be waiting.
0684857219|5.0|Even if you don't bodybuild, Arnold Swarzenegger's \\"Encyclopedia To Bodybuilding\\" is good to have around the house.

Sony, please burn this movie.
0451450523|5.0|Surprise it had a fair bit of humour which I must say showed the realistic of each character.
0195067142|5.0|This is an amazing memoir. It is honest, heartfelt, and at times gut wrenching in its portrayal of war in the Pacific. Sledge is a gifted writer. I had to read this for a US Military History class that I was taking, and I was presently suprised. Everyone should have to read this book. It is incredibly gory in its detail, but so is warfare.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant, what more can I say.  I love the new graphic, and wow can Cloud get any hotter?
B00005JLWN|5.0|I bought this movie after reading reviews for it on Amazon.  Needless to say I was not dissapointed. This film has some of the best action scenes of any movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale is great as the main character. I can't believe this movie is not more popular than it is. If you like action with a sci fi twist than you need to buy this movie!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This film starts at a running speed and never stops.  From watching Gandalf battle the demonic balrog to the collapse of Isengarde and everything else in between, there is hardly room to catch your breath - and it is wonderful.  Add to the surviving fellowship a new and wonderful group of people, the Riders of Rohan, who I have always been fond of - and of course the gnarly old Ents: tree people who are shepherds of the trees, keeping them in order, in their places in the forest.    The climax of the film is the huge double battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengarde.  I have found it most interesting that in sopite of talk of wizards and Elves, Tolkien's world is not one of magic. Elves seem to possess great longevity, but also an advanced technology implied rather than discussed.  And while there is a certain power among wizards, an example of Saurman's \\"magic\\" is no more mysterious than the ability to utilize gunpowder, no doubt high tech to Middle Earthers, and mysterious enough to seem magical.  (In the books, the Elves explained to Sam that some of their skills could have been learned by even a humble hobbit had they the time to study them)     For me, the battle of helm's Deep was always one of the slower moving parts oif the original books; but here, it is fast-moving and chock full of nail-biting action.      As usual, certain compromises between text and film are made, and the one part that does not sit well with me is the character of Faramir.  This was not the Faramir of Tolkien, and the character is never quite well realized.  But also as usual, the settings are wonderfulthe acting superb, and the music breathtaking.    The principle characters who are new, or may as well be new, include the sad princess Eowyn, her Uncle King Theoden, her brother Eomer, and the slithery traitor, \\"Wormtongue\\".  And, of course, the ruined Hobbit known by all as \\"Gollum\\".  Gollum threatens to steal the show, all the more so because he is a CGI character, brilliantly\\"portrayed\\" by Andy Serkis.    Once you've watched the extended version, you will never watch the theatrical release again.  This extended version is much more Tolkienseque, more complete, and more fun.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie while overwhelmingly enjoyable is outstanding piece of filmmaking. Just about every aspect of it is heads and shoulders above any movie that received Academy Award in last fifteen years. It takes not a talent but genius to make movie like that. The idea, the costumes, the actors, the music, the graphics everything is of fairy-tale, everything os a dream.  <br /> <br />For those morons who bash the movie, who complain of \\"whipping cream\\" jokes, hey have you ever been a child? Do you have any remotely recognizable concept of what is fun is? <br /> <br />Johnny Depp is amazing, convincing and funny. This movie is to be enjoyed by audience of any age. I am fan of this one. It is one of the best movies ever made, it will survive for very long time.
B00004TJTS|5.0|Great movie! Great actors! Great subject. Our family enjoyed this movie. Yours will too!! The author is from my home state so I can't help but be a bit prejudice!
B000K7UBTI|4.0|This \\"reinvented\\" Iron Man tale has many of the exciting aspects of the <br />Iron Man mythos without the corny or outmoded terms of the sixty's story <br />telling style.I just wish the Mandarin appeared sooner in this part cel animation,part c.g.i. production.
B000H1RFKA|4.0|This is a wonderful and much underrated film: and in Blu-Ray format the color is dazzling.  Add to that the self-referential script (including set decoration that you have to scan carefully to get all the hidden jokes) and the flip dialog and canny narrative from Robert Downey,Jr. and they add up to a delightful evening of smiles, chuckles and outright guffaws!  Watch closely!
1932907009|5.0|If a script is a blueprint for the movie, Blake Snyder's Save The Cat! is a crash course on the principles of screenplay architecture, a primer for an art form that requires the whole story--EVERYTHING--be told in fewer than 120 pages.  Blake's beat sheet alone makes the book worth its price.  And it's a great refresher course for experienced storytellers. <br /> <br />I give it five stars.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Ok, it's spring of 2002 and I have traveled three hours to visit my brother. We are both audiophiles with quite exceptional stereos and visits usually involve a fair amount of music listening. Shortly after I arrive he tells me \\"You've got to hear this, I picked it up this week while on business in Seattle\\". He puts on an original LP pressing of Porcupine Tree's \\"Signify\\". All four sides of this album are played and I don't utter the first word. You see, I've been a musician for 40+ years and I am bored with just about all new popular music. Most is just dreck. I had just experienced music that so captured me like no other in more than ten years. A few months later \\"In Absentia\\" is released. I buy it. Excellent. In 2005 \\"Deadwing\\" is released. Again, excellent. I see both of the US tours in '05. I see them again fall of '06. I'm a damned kid again! I start buying deeper into their back catalog and it's all good. I'm a fan. <br />\\"Arriving Somewhere\\" is a superb DVD that is at the top of the heap sonically. The music is well crafted, intelligent and the best of the prog genre out there. Although not a part of the studio recording players, John Wesley is used for the live shows for guitar and vocals and he is perfect in this role. Steven Wilson was wise and fortunate to have tapped this guy. I am a drummer. A white-haired-been-around-the-block drummer and I'm here to tell ya that Gavin Harrison, within this genre, is one of the best on the planet and this DVD is proof. Some may be put off with the switching between color and black-and-white and film flicker but, hey, it's art. It really didn't detract from my enjoyment. From both a technical and artistic standpoint it is one of the very best concert DVD's I've seen. Required viewing. <br />
B000GFLKF8|5.0|A typical grade A Denzel Washington movie.  I throughly enjoyed the action in this movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|You people should take that Declaration of Independence and burn it to ashes because after seeing this film I can't believe that anyone in their right mind would still be voting Republican. I'm not even American and I'm a more active democrat than all y'all! The evidence has been placed before the American people yet they have failed to overturn this evil administration that misled the world into a war with Iraq to satisfy their greed and their insatiable craving for oil. When I was a kid I always dreamt of going to America and being part of the American dream but I think I speak for many people when I say that the international community has never had a lower opinion of the United States. To blindly support a dyslexic moron in a presidency that is more focused on robbing poor nations of their resources is not the honorable image of America that I carried in my heart as a child. Now that I am an adult, I am witnessing the rich Republicans sending the poor of their own country to be killed by poor people in other countries, misleading the American public with falsified evidence to support their war machine, blowing up children and civilians in foreign countries in order to gain access to their resources in effect stealing from the people who have nothing while all the time declaring to the world in a self-righteous attitude that the worst is yet to come. America may have accomplished great things in the past when truly great men were elected as their presidents but the fact that the Bush administration is in control of the world's fate even after this documentary has exposed them for the lying bunch of baby-killers that they are should be enough to prove to the world that indeed dark forces are in control of American politics today.
1416524290|5.0|I picked up this book on a Saturday afternoon and read it overnight. It is definitely entertaining and interesting. I expected it to be scarier, but then again if it was, you'd be quickly leading down the path of Blair Witch...which I'm actually glad it wasn't. The outcome was pretty predictable and it's very short for a King book, but I'm glad I bought it. I agree it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B000MZHW4A|2.0|This movie was spoiled halfway through by the muddled accent that Leonardo di Caprio tries to pass off as Southern-African, not to mention the consistency with which he ends almost every line in the movie with the word, \\"Hey\\" which gets really annoying after the first 20 times. Another negative factor that managed to spoil this film is Hollywood's obsessive usage of pyrotechnics that surpass anything that an IQ over 30 might mistake for a realistic effect. Worse movies have been made but not one starring Leonadro di Caprio.
B00005R23S|5.0|Fifty years from now, after the Springsteen songbook has been fully mined, some singer/musician will do some research and discover that not only was Bruce Springsteen the most prolific songwriter of the 20th century, but also its most charismatic performer. <br />Such will be the legacy of Springsteen. He will be acknowledged as the greatest of all American songwriters of the 20th century, bar none. <br /> <br />It is hard to imagine the E Street Band being in finer form than as recorded at these 2000 Madison Square Garden performances. <br /> <br />I consider myself extremely fortunate in that I was unfamiliar with the songs \\"Youngstown\\" and \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", which are for me the highlights of this set. Quite frankly, there is nothing that is not magnificent on this set. It ranges from the merely phenomenal to the extra-galactic. <br /> <br />\\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" is a song that belongs to the ages.  <br />It strikes me as noteworthy that these performances preceded 9/11, and thus \\"The Rising\\". <br /> <br />Bruce is an American icon. He is fundamentally that most precious of things: A Good Man.  He is also a patriot who loves his America, the land of hope and dreams.  <br /> <br />And then came 9/11. And Bush's war. And Abu Ghraib. And the destruction of America's reputation among it's European allies that is saved from fascism half a century ago. <br /> <br />This concert(s) mark a point in time. A true \\"end of innocence\\". <br /> <br />Other highlights:  <br />You have to see the opening sequence of \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\" to believe it. <br />\\"If I should Fall Behind\\" <br />\\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\" <br /> <br />But really, it's all great. <br />At this point in time, the ESB is nothing short of magnificent. I did not fully appreciate their abilities until seeing this. <br />The vocal harmonies, so diverse, are beautiful. Nils and Patty -- wow! <br />Max on drums. He's first rate. <br />Nils guitar playing? Pat Methany would sit up and take noticeof his solo on \\"Youngstown.\\" <br /> <br />I could go on. Just order the damn thing now. It will become a prized possession, trust me.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|A typical movie about wizards in the modern day, not to shabby, if you have already seen the following movies: WARLOCK, PROPHECY & the MTV edited Korean flick VOLCANO HIGH. <br /> <br />The director and his guys makes it sound like this is the first time a movie like this was ever made, c'mon, I admit the tricks were executed neatly in the final production, but, the tricks are no longer new. Okay, the wires used for this movie are computerized, I guess the crew are too lazy to hoist the actors or the stuntmen? <br /> <br />Here is my comparison of this movie with the 3 movies I've mentioned: <br />WARLOCK: The idea of wizards and druids that still exist, supposedly, in our time today. Super-Human Powers, the lifting, flying and the fight scenes. <br />PROPHECY: The All-Dark-Eyes trick, Super-Human Powers, the lifting, the flying and the fight scenes. <br />VOLCANO HIGH: Camera Angles, CG and Wire Tricks, Super-Human Powers, the lifting, the flying and the fight scenes.

0316172324|4.0|after reading this book, i was much more aware of facial expressions and subtleties of movement, and much more trusting of first impressions and intuitions.  i have a background in western philosophy, and i've been taught that (from the platonic tradition) feelings are not to be trusted without careful examination.  this book gave examples of instances in which feelings outpreform careful examination, and even that careful examination can lead a person astray. this was a radically new idea for me - or at least the evidence pointed to a radically new conclusion than i'd thought. it was highly enjoyable, and sparked good discussion with a friend who was also reading the book.   <br /> <br />after reading this book, i started going to play \\"the village\\", which is a role-playing game like mafia.  it's a game played with a group of 8 or more people, and one or two of these is randomly assigned to be a \\"werewolf\\".  noone but the werewolf knows her status, and the group is trying to figure out who it is.  it's a really fun game! <br />i found that i was more in touch with my intuition, and found that if i paid attention to people and listened carefully, i would get an idea of who the werewolf is - my first instinct was usually right. <br /> <br />the reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because i think it has a bit of a pro-market, pro-consumption perspective.  since i read it a few months ago, i can't remember exactly where that bias is, but i was left with it.    i also recall that some of the experiments that the book describes seem to have little flaws.  for example i remember one gambling experiment with different colored chips or cards, and the conclusion was that the people knew subconsciously that one color led to good results (tested by monetering heart rate, blood pressure, etc), and the other to bad results.  what the experiment leaves out is that maybe one color is more appealing than the other, and this is the cause of the difference in response, or maybe one color was always put on the right hand side, etc... anyway, the experiement could have been done switching up the \\"desirable color\\", but this wasn't mentioned or addressed in the book.
0156027321|5.0|This is one of the best novels! The author Yann Martel writes in an interesting way where he is able to integrate the present, where he meets with Pi, and also integrates the past, where he writes about Pi's trials and tribulations as a teenager and his journey.  This true story is incredible and at times so unbelievable that the reader can get so engrossed with the story that this book has to be read in a matter of days.  It is such an easy read that young teenagers would be able to read and understand the content.  This book is also inspirational; as a reader, knowing that it is a true story along with the odds that Pi overcame, makes the reader almost wish they had something to make his/herself as great a person as the character of Pi Patel.
0307237699|3.0|As a disclaimer, I am not a liberal nor a progressive.  I am also not a Republican or a Democrat.  I am very much anti-politician.  I would likely be considered conservative by most, but I think of myself as an American traditionalist, one who subscribes to the founding principles of this country.  The purpose of reading Obama's book was to simply know more about the man who may be our next President. So I pushed aside any preconceived notions I may have had and listened to Obama read to me as I traveled along I-49 en route to New Orleans with an open mind. This is what I learned.<br /><br />First, Obama is a genuine person just as I suspected. He is a family man devoted to his wife and children. He loves his country. He is proud of his heritage and his accomplishments, but he is hardly boastful. He is honest. He has a lot of ideas for making America a better place. And, he has a realistic and accurate perception of the political atmosphere in Washington. There are too many trivial things keeping us from tackling very un-trivial issues. Obama knows that and he isn't afraid to point it out. That is perhaps what most appeals to conservatives about him. His ideas are what appeals most to progressives. And, politically speaking, he is very far left despite a vain attempt to appear centrist or \\"third option\\" a la Bill Clinton.<br /><br />In the interest of space, I will address just a few key issues he mentions. He is pro-immigration. He points this out by discussing an encounter with a Latino family on the campaign trail. It was touching and sweet, but the issue of illegal immigration and the national security threat it poses (and the accompanying economic drain) was left open. I don't know what he would do to secure our borders. He believes in the threat of global warming and wants to eliminate our addiction to foreign oil. Sounds great. But there wasn't much detail about how he would do it and how it would affect us, the voters, except by saying that he would stop government subsidies to oil companies and spend more on researching alternative fuels. He believes in government sponsored health care and described how he wanted all Americans to have health insurance. Again, it sounded wonderful, until he described how he would pay for it. It sounded incredibly familiar - by \\"rolling back\\" the Bush tax cuts on the top 1% of wealthy Americans. That's when he officially lost my vote. Either he is lying, or he simply doesn't understand just how expensive this sort of plan would truly be. The average Australian pays 49% income tax for their government health care. Hillary Clinton's plan in the 90s would have called for at least that much. I don't believe Obama is a liar, so I'll chalk it up to a simple inexperienced underestimate. Either way, I feel Barak Obama would raise my taxes significantly. There wasn't much about the war on terror and the global threat of Islamofascism. The omission was quite troubling.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad I read the book. I've read many books on Hillary Clinton and, compared to her, Obama is a far better choice. I disagree with him politically on just about every issue, but I share his concern for America's future and his genuine love of family and country. He is a decent person with true intent. I wouldn't have a problem trusting him as a person, unlike most other Democrats in the race, but I do have a problem with his ideas. As much as I respect him, I simply don't think his plans are the best course for America.government subsidies to oil companies and spend more on researching alternative fuels.

0743454537|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I could not put the book down and finished it in a day and a half.  Many people have commented on the end of this book and yes it did make me mad but that is what makes the book so good. I was so wrapped up in it and felt truly felt a part of it.  After I finished reading, I couldn't stop thinking about it and analyzing what happened.  That is a sign of a well written book.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love every song on this CD; John Mayer is the best!!
B000M341QE|2.0|I thought the movie had an interesting premise: a criminal organisation sends one of their own undercover to infiltrate the state police force, while at the same time, that same police force sends one of their own undercover to infiltrate the same criminal organisation. It's a Martin Scorcese film and has some great actors in it, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Walberg, Matt Damon and Martin Sheen. I have a lot of respect for all of them and greatly admire their collective body of work.<br /><br />Still, for some reason I didn't rush out to go see it when it was in the cinema and now I believe it was my instincts telling me not to. One thing I know for sure: if I had gone to see it in the cinema, I would've walked out after the first twenty minutes - and I even doubt I'd have lasted that long.<br /><br />My problem with this movie was the racist and homophobic language that assaulted me right from the get-go. The N word was liberally used to describe black people, I heard the G word used to describe Italians (I actually had to go look that one up in the dictionary) and then there was copious use of the Q word and the H word as a form of homophobic abuse. I'm a man of the world and I've been around. I know racism and homophobia are out there, alive and well and I was thinking, well, maybe that's how people used to talk in Boston 'some years ago'. Maybe that's how they still talk now (very interesting accents, by the way). I'm all for realism. Still, for a man who is both black and gay, it was tough going. It felt relentless. I found myself wondering what it must be like to live in Boston if you're black. Or gay. Or both.<br /><br />As much as I tried to get into the movie - as I had it on DVD, I could stop when I felt it got a bit too much and come back to it later. I did that three or four times - after about twenty minutes or so into it, I just had to give up. The atmosphere of menace and impending doom I felt just added to my discomfort and queasiness, and even though the language wasn't so bad after a while, the beginning of the movie had spoilt it for me and I had to take it back. I didn't like it. It could possibly go on to win a truckload of awards simply by virtue of its director and the lead actors, who did seem to be giving very good performances, but this one was not for me.<br /><br />Good thing it was only a rental.queasiness, and even though the language wasn't so bad after a while, the beginning of the movie had spoilt it for me and I had to take it back.

Someone once told me that dieing is just part of living....and this movie tells that with a positive twist.  I just plain liked it.  Oh, I do believe in angels so that could be why i like it too.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little 7 year old Olive Hoover discovers (to her screeching delight), that she's won a place in the finals of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant in California. Alas, the only way to get there from New Mexico where she lives with her totally dysfunctional (but amazingly endearing) family is by road and so to the road it is, with the mother who serves her family take-away southern fried chicken every day for dinner and doesn't seem to feel there's anything wrong with it, the father who's staring bankruptcy in the face while desperately (but futilely) trying to sell some silly self-help idea, the brother who's taken a vow of silence in a bid to get into the air force, the suicidal genius uncle fresh out of the psychiatric ward and last but not least, the grandpa who snorts heroin to help pass his time in retirement. People, we have the makings of a cross-country journey of a lifetime.<br /><br />I loved every minute and actually learned a few lessons from it:<br /><br />1. True beauty is absolutely what's inside a person and not what's on the outside and in this day and age, this is definitely a message we should ensure our children hear from us.<br /><br />2. A family of misfits and neurotics that love and support each other is still a loving and supportive family.<br /><br />3. A loser isn't someone who doesn't win; it's someone who's so afraid of losing he doesn't even try. (And this one has particular personal relevance).<br /><br />This is a family road trip movie with a difference. Great acting from Greg Kinnear, Toni Collete, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin, the wonderful little Abigail Breslin as Olive and last but by no means least, that plucky yellow VW van. Despite a myriad of continuity and geographical goofs - see how many you can spot - directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris have put together a fantastic piece of art here. My heart was in my mouth for Olive towards the end, when the silly beauty pageant finally takes place but the ending was not just totally unexpected it ended up being terrifically heart-warming. Sometimes these little indie films are simply the best. Definitely one to own as I will want to watch this again.<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" has earned well-deserved Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations as well as Best Spporting Actor and Actress nominations for Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.<br /><br />Not much in the DVD extras, just special features that offer directors' commentary and alternate endings with optional director's commentary.not just totally unexpected it ended up being terrifically heart-warming.

B000MZHW4A|5.0|watch this movie if only to see the amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Don't believe those people who probably have no idea what a real South African accent sounds like - he does it better than any actor I have ever heard or seen ever. Aside from the accent, he plays his character with much conviction and believability. Djimon Housou is also very good in this movie although he is somewhat betrayed by having to play yet another martyr type role. Jennifer Connelly sometimes I felt read her lines as if she were reciting from a book. The movie flew by for me and I recommend with the highest enthusiasm
B000J103PC|5.0|With the success of \\"Ugly Betty\\" on the small screen and now this movie on the big one, I'm guessing (or maybe just hoping) that the world might finally be starting to question its collective obsession with its facile media-driven ideals of beauty. I don't know anyone personally who works in the fashion media industry but the online forum buzz is that it's very much like depicted here (both \\"Betty\\" and \\"Prada\\" have 'the book', for instance - guard it with your life! - and apparently, all the top fashion mags have them) and if that's the case, why anyone would actually want to work in such a vacuous and cut-throat environment is totally beyond me.<br /><br />But be that as it may, this movie, directed by Sex In The City man David Frankel, and based on the best-selling book by Lauren Weisberger, manages to remain respectful to the fashion media, raise some important issues while making me laugh hysterically at the same time. It's all good fun at the end of the day and maybe I take stuff too seriously. Anne Hathaway is great as Andrea Sachs, the girl who wants to be a journalist and believes that taking a job as 2nd assistant to Miranda Priestley, the editor-in-chief of 'Runway' magazine (played by Meryl Streep) is a step in the right direction towards achieving her goal. Andy doesn't give a hoot about fashion, (well, not to begin with anyway), doesn't know who Priestley is and even had to ask over the phone after apparently taking a call from someone at Dolce & Gabanna how 'Gabanna' is actually spelt!<br /><br />Stanley Tucci as Nigel the catty art director, was also a lot of fun to watch as was Emily Blunt as Miranda's 1st assistant with the glass-cutting British accent, as was Simon Baker as the oily, smooth-talking charmer Christian Thompson, as was Andy's calm, collected, patient, down-to-earth and very supportive (not to mention very pretty) boyfriend Nate, played by Adrian Grenier. There are even cameo appearances by Heidi Klum, Bridget Hall and Valentino Garavani himself, all appearing as themselves at a Paris fashion show. It certainly added to the haute couture realism of the movie.<br /><br />But it's Meryl Streep who's the absolute hoot here as the Galliano-clad Ice Queen bitch boss from hell (she must have had so much fun playing the role) and has gone on to earn herself a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination. As one might expect, the movie has also earned an Achievement in Costume Design Oscar.<br /><br />So, will Andrea survive her experience at Runway, or more specifically, will she survive Miranda?  Will she remain the same person and will any of her personal relationships survive? Will Andy come out the other end of her experience with Runway with the same well-adjusted, healthy attitude and belief system she went in with? I was certainly keen to find out.<br /><br />Banging soundtrack too, including great songs by among others, KT Tunstall, Ray LaMontagne, Madonna, U2 and Jamiroquai.<br /><br />And there's a whole bag of DVD extras here -  including commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes, gag reel, and the movie theatrical trailer - way too many to list but definitely worth checking out.aravani himself, all appearing as themselves at a Paris fashion show.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The period setting, artful cinematography, and darkly magical mood of \\"The Illusionist\\" combine to create the kind of film that is an experience rather than just another movie to be viewed and quickly forgotten. The predictable happy ending is offset by a plot that combines surprises, metaphors, and foreshadowings of things to come in a magically appealing mixture that enthralls the viewer.<br /><br />When Eisenheim, played by Edward Norton, teaches amateur magician Chief Inspector Uhl, Paul Giamatti, the trick of determining in which hand a subject is hiding a ball, it is revealed that this is no trick at all but rather simple observation. The actual trick is both in truly seeing and in making the moment seem magical. Through a more complicated, but related, slight-of-hand, \\"The Illusionist\\" explores the nature of power and the power of imagination to change the way we see the world and ultimately reality itself.<br /><br />In the end, this film is so captivating because it returns to the best tenants of storytelling. The classic romance story of the apparently hopeless love of a boy for a girl far beyond his station is renewed yet again with the addition of a strong sense of place, time, and character that transport the viewer and a plot that is at once mythic and whimsically allegorical.

184343217X|5.0|I'm hooked. I started reading The Redbreast on President's Day weekend and at first was skeptical. The tale seemed to bounce from one era--the present--back to the 1940s, and then back to the 1990s again, for no real reason. Until the characters wormed their way into my consciousness and the stories of WWII and the story of 1999 began to come together, that is. Wow! I stayed up nearly all night, unable to put this down. Nesbo creates real people in her characters, whose thoughts, no matter how horrific, are made understandable to the reader along with their passions, their fears and their hurts. I consider this not only a major contribution to the mystery/police thriller genres, but to the psychological and character-driven best works of Barbara Vine. This story creeps up on you without your being aware of it. Before you know it, you MUST discover what is going on and what will happen next. Highly recommended.
0446677450|4.0|Much of the information in the book is interesting, and I believe valuable for adults who are able to understand that alternatives exist to the traditional career path.

No matter where Queen was emotionally, I for one believe there is no better culmination than Innuendo. [Sorry Douglas, Bon Jovi is just not Mercury caliber.] No other group, or album, achieves the \\"unboundedness\\" as Innuendo. Freddy and Queen will live forever, through the music. I could not imagine a more fitting finale to the greatest show on earth. Freddy, this one touched the stars, and I hope you did too.

B000LC55F2|3.0|I had high hopes for this one.  Great actors, period piece, mystery, magic... but it sort of fell apart in the middle and the end was just ridiculous.  Parts of the story were good and I wish they had just stuck with what seemed like the \\"original\\" story line.  A decently entertaining movie, but you'll really need to exercise your suspension of disbelief.
B00004YYDI|4.0|I saw this film several years ago, and recently looked for it, but couldn't remember the name of it or who was in it, so I was happy to find it again.  It's the story of a guy from the old country, illiterate, living poorly, who owes a favor to a mobster.  And he's a hit man, and a good one.  He takes in a young girl whose family has been blown away by a crooked federal agent, and she decides she'd like to learn his trade to avenge her little brother's death.  And she and the hitman develop an, um, special relationship.  Great movie!
0374105235|5.0|This is an extraordinary memoir by a young man who has lived and seen the worst of humanity and managed to survive and become a better man for all the tragedy, violence, horror and degradation he was forced to witness as a 12 year old boy. I can see this as required reading in high schools across the country. It is not only that good, it is that important. The writing is honest, straight forward, painfully introspective but never self pitying. Truly an amazing story, and a history lesson we all need be reminded of now and again.

It is a joy and a great gift.  Thank you, Eckhart Tolle!
0385732554|3.0|\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is an insightful novel that gives us the perspective--what would happen if there were no feelings? What if there was no pain? What if there was no happiness or passion? The world would live in a utopia, but would it really be worth it? The novel follows a boy named Jonas who discovers feelings, but everyone around him remains neutral. He wants to show them pain, happiness, warfare, fear, passion. But, such things could ruin the utopia. The novel really gives you a grateful feeling that you can experience feelings.
1569242739|5.0|This book has a great variety of easy to make cupcakes. I've made five batches to date and have only had the book for 2 months. The final product is perfect to bring to parties as they look really impressive, just as in the book. And, speaking of picture perfect- the photography in the book is wonderful and your cupcakes will look the same, especially if you take the bit of extra time on the finishing touches. Your friends and family will have absolutely no idea these delicious desserts are made free of dairy! I highly recommend this book for it's clean design, simple recipes and let's not forget the end product is quite delicous!
0099489988|4.0|This is the first Marian Keyes book I've ever read, given to me as a gift.  It made for pleasant reading before bedtime, but took me a month to finish -- it definitely didn't keep me intrigued enough to keep me reading when I was tired, unlike some other really great novels.  But, I'll read more Marian Keyes in the future.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I don't claim to be a movie critic, I'm just a regular guy.  And I thought this movie was one of the best sports movies that I've ever seen!  I would rank it right up there with Hoosiers, Rudy and Remember the Titans.  It's not necessarily a feel-good movie, like the others I mentioned, but it's just a great story!  The west-Texas realism is outstanding!

B0001WGDX0|5.0|I couldn't live without recordings of classical music, but please, somebody shoot me if I ever get as snobbish as some of the reviewers nitpicking this box set. The sound quality is excellent. (These symphonies were all recorded live in concert, so the performances truly breathe.) The interpretations are, to my ear, deeply considered and extremely moving, especially the second movement of the Seventh. And best of all, you can't beat the price (and this is Deutsche Grammaphone we're talking about, usually the most expensive pressings). So if you know some person, young or old, who wants to know where to start with building a classical collection, get them this set as a gift. How can you not like this music?
1932100660|5.0|I am forever grateful for this book. Though vegetarian for decades, I had never taken the step into veganism. This is the book which convinced me to take that step. The statistics are quite telling. <br /> <br />The first couple of weeks were an adjustment period, but after this I began to feel absolutely wonderful. I'm eating a basically whole-food vegan diet. With a few vegan cookbooks, the food is truly delicious and satisfying. And with a crockpot and rice-cooker, it's quick and easy, too.  <br /> <br />I have so much more energy and my mood is significantly higher. I can exercise much longer and more intensely at the gym and I really *want* to move. I've never felt so good. I'm eating as much as I want and I've actually lost a few pounds. <br /> <br />I'm so glad I read this book and I hope more and more people take this valuable information to heart.

B00005JPFQ|3.0|By no means a great film, but a fun one nonetheless. I'm not really a fan of comic book based movies unless they're done really well (The Crow, Daredevil, Sin City) and I don't like goody-two-shoes super heroes. Having thoroughly enjoyed Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil (I know, everyone and their mother hated it but I find it's Marvel's best comic book movie), I was curious to see if he could adapt Ghost Rider and keep the dark undertones of the comic. To my surprise, the movie kept the spirit of the rider, as much as a PG-13 flick allows, anyway.<br /><br />I didn't agree with the choice of casting Nick Cage as Johnny Blaze but he pulled it off; felt a bit too much like an Elvis impersonation at times (especially with the sunglasses), but overall, he did a good job. Eva Mendes did the best she could with the poor dialogue she had to deliver. Peter Fonda and Wes Bentley were perfect as Mephistopheles and Blackheart, respectively. Sam Elliott was his usual cool self with his portrayal of the caretaker, Johnny's guide.<br /><br />The plot was rather formulaic, plagued by cheesy scenes, and tended to drag at times, but when the Ghost Rider finally shows up, it's worth the wait. The CG is top notch and the effects of the Rider driving his flaming motorcycle, burning everything in his path are impressive. I also enjoyed the flashback sequence a la Daredevil when Johnny was a kid with his father. The climax, although predictable, was fun to watch.<br /><br />This film's not going to be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're a fan of Cage or Ghost Rider, or if like me you don't go for colorful heroes like Spider-Man, you should check it out.

B000002HEM|2.0|I'm a huge Natalie Merchant & 10,000 Maniacs fan, but this MTV Unplugged live concert is a big disappointment. I was hoping Natalie's crystalline natural voice would be enhanced without a recording studio's interference, but each song seems to have the same tempo, the same sound. The entire album was flat and uninspiring. I actually got sleepy driving to it. I'm too big a fan to give it 1 star, but this was a major disappointment.
B00005M91K|5.0|I can not believe all of the hard work that went into making this movie. Decades of photography. Hundreds of rolls of film. Many countries. Many people. Many points of view.  <br /> <br />I believe that everything that went into this movie is from the heart. A vision of what the world is going through as a whole. Our earth for starters. Taking us into the world of the organic animals and plants, rock formations and valleys, that can not speak for themselves. The only voice they have is through our eyes. If we can gaze at their magnificance and some how feel responsible and sympathetic and struck by them... then we have the ability to help. The movie then takes you into our human society. A society of tribes, of nations, of cities, of streets, of pollution, of ritual, of religion, many themes that are touched on within this movie. Even our own hatred is a theme here.  <br /> <br />You must see this piece. It will change your life forever.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|I love the movie and the soundtrack, but this CD compilation is an overall disappointment. Two of the songs that were core to the movie -- the comeback Xmas song by the aging rock star, and the song sung by the 12-year-old love interest during the school musical -- are here as \\"bonus\\" tracks, and the recordings are absolutely horrible!! The young girl (Olivia Olson) is such an exciting surprise talent in the film but her song on the CD sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. And the comeback Xmas song doesn't even sound like the same song or that it's even sung by the same artist (Billy Mack). What a bummer!!! On the plus side, \\"Songbird\\" by Eva Cassidy is worth the price of the CD, and it's nice to hear an older and wiser Joni Mitchell singing her seminal \\"Both Sides Now\\" so many years later.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Don't believe the hype!  This is not Miyazaki's best film, not by far.  Check out Naussica: Of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky, or even Howl's Moving Castle for better Miyazaki.<br /><br />That said, this movie is still better than just about anything produced by American animation in the past, well, ever.  If you're one of those people like me who grew up thinking that The Lion King was the standard for animation, then prepare to be amazed.<br /><br />This Academy Award winning film tells the story of a young girl who's family wanders into an abandoned amusement park that has be re-purpoused as a bath-house for shinto spirits.  Her parents are cursed for eating the spirit's food, and she spends the rest of the film trying to free them.<br /><br />Along the way she meets a colorful cast of characters and finds that the world is more full of wonder than could possibly be imagined in your philosophy.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|After all the hype I thought this movie would be great.  Instead it leaves you feeling disgusted and sad that there are probably alot of people out there who are as pitiful as the characters in this film.  If you are looking for a good laugh, this isn't the movie to watch.  There's very little funny about it.
B00005JPFO|3.0|\\"Ghost Rider\\" is based on a comic book character, and because of that, I know that I'm supposed to be somewhat lenient. Indeed, I was able to overlook the preposterous story, the cliche choices in setting and character, and the fact that every aspect of the plot was completely contrived. All that can slide in a comic book adaptation; it's meant to be fun, not meaningful. And true to its word, this is mindless entertainment at its purest. I also give it credit for being an incredibly good-looking film, with incredible special effects and entertaining stunts that are sure to please any action film buff. Top that off with the fact that this is a supernatural story, one that involves demons, the Devil, and yes, a man who transforms into a flaming skeleton. We now have a slight horrific edge, which makes the film that much more enjoyable.    Still, I think that even a comic book adaptation should attempt to raise the bar in terms of performance and dialogue. The qualities of both elements are seriously lacking in \\"Ghost Rider,\\" and that forces me to lower my ranking to three stars. It seemed like the actors were purposely lax, as if they lost interest because they were starring in such a stylized, unrealistic film. That's not the way it works. Even if the material is ridiculous, even if the characters are flimsy and over the top, a comic book adaptation still deserves decent performances. Nothing of the sort was given for this film; every line was so amateurish that they barely passed as laughable. Likewise, every character was underplayed, overdone, or just plain poorly acted.    The most prominent example of this is Nicholas Cage; after five minutes of watching him perform in this film, it was hard to believe that it was the same Nicholas Cage who won an Oscar for \\"Leaving Las Vegas.\\" He plays Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle daredevil with a lot of baggage. As a teenager (played by Matt Long), he sold his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his father (Brett Cullen), who was dying of lung cancer. Unfortunately, he died the next day due to a failed motorcycle stunt (you guessed it; his father was also a daredevil). The reasoning is simple: curing the cancer was the only part of the deal. Furthermore, keeping him alive might spoil the Devil's future plans for Johnny. This is probably why he's been able to avert disaster as an adult; some of his stunts go horribly wrong, yet he always comes away unscathed. \\"You've got an angel looking after you,\\" says Mack (Donal Logue), Blaze's manager. \\"Maybe it's something else,\\" Blaze replies ominously.    Yes, it is in fact something else. And now, it seems that Mephistopheles has finally found use for Blaze: he'll be turned into a Ghost Rider, a kind of demonic bounty hunter. By day, Blaze will be a normal man. But by night, in the presence of evil, he'll transform into a fleshless, flammable monster. His mission is to hunt the Devil's demon son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), and his three cohorts. If Blaze succeeds, his soul will be set free. Why is this mission so important? Blackheart has recently escaped from Hell with the intent to find a missing contract, one that was signed by a greedy man 150 years ago in a remote western town. Apparently, another Ghost Rider was supposed to deliver it to Mephistopheles. But instead of delivering the goods, this rogue bounty hunter ran off, never to be seen again, denying the Devil a chance to possess a legion of evil souls.    This is where Blackheart comes in. He has some issues with daddy, and it definitely shows through his immature teenager-like attitude. He hopes to resolve these issues by overthrowing his father, which can only be done if he's in possession of the contract. How exactly this would work is never adequately explained, but I suppose it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it makes for fine conflict with Blaze, which is a must in any such story of a dark superhero. And it makes for some really impressive computer generated imagery, especially in moments when Blaze is forced to transform. If you like watching people go up in flames, then you'll love this movie.    The other side of the story involves Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes), who had a failed romance with Blaze back when they were teenagers. Today she's a news reporter: smart, ambitious, and needing an extra button for her conveniently revealing blouse. She takes the opportunity to reunite with Blaze during one of his acrobatic shows (involving jumping his motorcycle across six operational helicopters at a distance of 300 feet). Here's a subplot that could have been affective had it not been for Mendes' performance. It was awful, to be perfectly honest. It's bad enough having to deliver some of the film's worst lines. Example: she waits in a restaurant for Blaze to show up. To pass the time, she downs glass after glass of wine. When she's thoroughly drunk, she turns to her waiter and asks, \\"You think I'm pretty, right?\\" Yes, it's a dumb line, and it was made dumber because the line was delivered badly (oh, and in case you were wondering, Blaze doesn't show up; that happened to be the night of his first transformation).    As Blackheart continues searching for the contract, Blaze has a chance meeting with a mysterious caretaker (Sam Elliott) who tends a middle-of-nowhere graveyard (coincidently, it's the same graveyard where Blaze's father is buried). He's a strange man who seems to know an awful lot about Blaze and his \\"condition,\\" something the audience shouldn't find at all surprising; let's just say it's obvious right from the start who he really is. Anyway, he warns Blaze that he must stay away from family and friends. He also tells him to stay on graveyard property because Blackheart cannot step on hallowed ground (if only this were followed through; later on in the film, Blackheart stands inside a church, completely unaffected by it).    Does Blaze listen? Of course not. He has a mission, one that he can't back out of. But will Blaze and Roxanne ever be able to rekindle an old flame (pun definitely intended)? Will the forces of evil be stopped before it's too late? Why am I even asking these questions? I can say that it all makes for great action sequences and shots of digital wizardry. If only it paved the way for an enjoyable film with enjoyable performances. \\"Ghost Rider\\" delivers in that it's visuals are spectacular. But the story is weak. The dialogue is substandard, as is the acting. How disappointing; such half-hearted attempts can only make a comic book adaptation difficult to engage. Someone must have made a deal with the Devil to get this film made. In time, I'm sure that that someone will pay the price.
B000BJS4TO|3.0|there are some hauntingly beautiful melodies and some which are not.  I like to listen on my PC where it is easy to select the tracks I prefer; but, the entire cd is not very nice.

0066620996|5.0|I've had this book on my short list to read for the last few years but was not compelled to start because of my bias that an academic can't possibly understand the underpinnings of business like a CEO/Executive/Entreprenuer with real-world experience. After finaly reading this book, I was definitely convinced otherwise. Good to Great is based on thousands of hours of investigation by a team of researchers rather than just antecodotal evidence and personal opinions that comprise many other business books. The research methodology, while not perfect, seems to be about as good as you could get based on the infinite number of variables within the business environment. Jim Collins does an excellent job of distilling the finding of his research team into an extremely well written, concise book full of beneficial statistics, case studies, interviews, references and stories of the individual companies selected from the study. I really feel that there are real nuggets of wisdom in this book and I am better off for having read it. I can't wait to read his previous work, Built to Last.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I said elsewhere that \\"Modern Times\\" was better than \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" But, I was wrong. This record gets more tedious with each listen. The band is competent but unadventerous. Please, Mr. Garnier, how about an interesting bass line with some nice harmonic overtones or high-register melodic lines (like the triplets on \\"Mississippi\\")? An endless parade of six minute two-step and blues songs without bridges or 'B' sections; some fine lyrics, as expected, but much writing that is unexceptional. And the singing? Now, I happen to think that Mr. Dylan is the best white blues singer that ever walked down a sidewalk in L.A., NYC or Yazoo, MS. But his voice has deteriorated significantly from his majestic \\"Love and Theft\\". There are maybe one or two \\"great\\" songs here: Workingman's Blues #2 is for sure, one such. But, the turnarounds after each verse and chorus (of \\"boots and shoes\\"--well sung!)are so amateurish that I'm nearly shocked that \\"Jack Frost\\" didn't ask the band to go back and redo them. Dylan has completed his trilogy, paid homage in the last to Muddy Waters and Sleepy John Estes...and is, likely, searching for another direction and source of inspiration. His deep exploration of \\"wierd marginalized erase-trace\\" America has been a great artistic journey for the ages, rivaling the surrealist-amphetamaniac(sic) period of the mid-60s and the tattered-troubadour greatness of the mid-70s. \\"Modern Times\\" feels like Dylan has already thrown out an eye for what's ahead and left a disembodied ghost (pardon the pleonasm) to sweep up the soundstage and close the door. So...what is next???? I'm betting on a prophetic painted-face violin-driven plea from Mt. Zion for sobriety and against the seductivenss of false-peace and forgetfullness. Tour coming: Europe beware! You will be called to the fire again. And after Auschwitz, will you--the 'bride'--dare again to flee from your vows? I'm afraid you already have. And Dylan knows it too!
B000M5AJQI|3.0|Without giving too much away, I found the ending to be needlessly depressing.  I know Scorsese likes to make his movies realistic so you're never gonna get the \\"happy Hollywood ending\\" with him. But this ending went out of it's way to be as unhappy as possible - so much so that it became unrealistic.  Think of the \\"Goodfellas\\" or \\"Blow\\" endings only with more dead people.  It almost seems as though there is no message at the end other than \\"everyone dies on both sides of the law.\\"  Great, glad I spent 2 1/2 hours to learn that.

B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia works well with an excellent group of actors. I especially loved Hilary Swank's character; very friendly yet sharp. Al Pacino, of course, makes the movie. He is a skillful actor, but be prepared for profanity.  Just like Gene Hackman turned nearly every movie he starred in into a profanity laden trip, so does Pacino. If you don't prefer certain four letter words, don't watch it or keep your finger on the mute button. Other than offensive language, this movie is a must-see. It keeps you guessing.

1932907009|5.0|Okay. There's loooots of screenwriters out there right? And any of us who're half serious have read STORY by McKee and SREENPLAY by Syd Field and a few others right?<br /><br />Well, SAVE THE CAT! is the perfect synthesis of all of those. What's brilliant about the book is Blake Snyder's ability to be vastly informative and accessibly succint at the same time. The book's not even 200 pages!<br /><br />And it's such a fun read too. He makes these big declarative statements but then says something tongue in cheek to let you know he's not taking himself too seriously. Also, he delves into the importance of some things that, at least I, took for granted. Like the dreaded \\"character arc\\". I've always cringed when I heard that phrase. I knew I needed to have it but I didn't really grasp why. The way Blake explains though is so fresh and obvious and human that I finally understand WHY it's such an important convention in the first place.<br /><br />His entire methodology of going from an IDEA to LOGLINE to a BEAT SHEET onto a BULLITEN BOARD and then, finally, to the KEYBOARD is the blueprint I've been looking for ever since I started writing scripts.<br /><br />I've vehemently reccommended this book to all my writer friends and I do the same thing for you. It truly has all the answers you need to write anything.<br /><br />He has a great line about how screenplays are like intricately made swiss watches. And how once you truly grasp how scripts are made, you can open the back of the watch and understand how the myriad of gears work together in unison to make the watch function.<br /><br />Well, now I can tell time. Thanks Blake.<br /><br />George

159562015X|3.0|If you've read Buckingham's books (esp. \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\") it's hard to say there's much more here.  In fact, there isn't.  The stickers you can paste on the front of the book and printable door hangers are silly gimmicks, and there is very little new information on your themes.     Is the test really any better or more accurate?  It's impossible to say.  The book says in most cases you'll end up with four of the same five themes.      If you take the test again and get one or two \\"new\\" top 5 themes, you've gained some insight I suppose.  This begs the question, why doesn't Gallup rank your strengths 1 through 34 instead of giving you a glimpse of the top 5 only?      This is merely an extra entry fee to move the curtain only slightly.  If you're a strengths-based fanatic like me, go ahead and buy it.  But be warned, Rath is no Buckingham.  \\"Now Discover\\" is a vastly superior book.
0312330537|2.0|I'm more than half way through this book and I think I'm done reading it. Much of it has been very engaging and entertaining. But in the end I just don't believe the voice of the author any longer.  <br /> <br />You see, everybody loves Lin. Simple villagers love him, slum dwellers love him, beautiful ex-prostitutes love him, gangsters love him, afghani drug lords love him, taxi drivers always love him at a glance and so on and so forth. The only people who don't love him are the few truly evil and brutal characters in the book and they hate him because it's only right that evil would hate such a paragon of love. After a certain point it's just silly. The narrator has no real flaws and moves with ease in every social circle under the Mumbai sun.  <br /> <br />And the author always knows everything he needs to know and has every skill he needs to have. He starts the book as a rough and tough man of the streets. But it turns out he is a karate master. And it turns out he studied under great philosophers and it turns out that he gained his social sensitivity from his parents who are renowned socialists. If the plot required the flying of a 747 I'm sure we would learn how Lin spent summers at his uncles flying school and is an ace pilot. <br /> <br />In the end the protaganist seems like some kind of MacGyver of love and virtue and skill; he just pulls any needed talent or feeling off his toolbelt and he can do anything and win love from anyone. <br /> <br />But, for me, once the narrator's voice rings false the book is done. It doesn't matter how interesting the secondary characters are or how compelling the plotline. If I can't trust any of it then I don't want to read it.
034544678X|5.0|Yes, I'll admit, I'm a dog lover and will be tempted by almost any title that pertains to the beasties. But this book appeals on several levels. It will delight and instruct many like myself, but it will also appeal to people who wonder about the psychology of human and canine interaction. It teaches amusing (and sometimes not so amusing) lessons to some of us who \\"misread\\" various animal responses as having any similarity to recognized human responses. <br /> <br />And Patricia McConnell is a good writer--compassionate, funny, and seriously committed to her values.
0684830515|3.0|Let me just first compliment how perceptive some of the Amazon reviews of \\"the Sun Also Rises\\" are, whether pointing out how effectively Hemingway's terse style can describe a particularly intense scene, or the internal conflicts that each main character struggles with, or the parallelism that Hemingway does so well (for instance, the similarities between the relationship of the matador and bull, as compared with Brett's relationship with the various men who fall in love with her). <br /> <br />The novel, of course, is told from the point of view Jake Barnes (an American expatriate now living and working as a reporter in Paris), a decent but understandably bitter sort of guy, rendered impotent due to an injury sustained while fighting in the first World War.  Basically, he describes a week or two in his life with the gorgeous desirable Brett, Brett's \\"fiancee\\" Mike, an obnoxious Jewish semi-successful writer named Robert Cohn, and all around good-guy drinking buddy Bill.  Jake and Bill intially set off on a pleasant fishing trip in a small rural Spanish village, and then join up with the other three in Pamplona for the big \\"Fiesta\\" - the principle event of which is bullfighting, of which Jake is an \\"aficionado\\" (passionate fan).  All three men are in love with Brett who returns (or has returned) the favor when it suits her.  Basically, all the characters stay drunk morning, noon, and night for the entire trip, but Brett ends up running off with a promising young bullfighter named Pedro Romero, causing another aficionado, who owns the hotel they're staying at, to grow hostile towards his former friend Jake, and his friends. <br /> <br />A few observations: <br /> <br />1. The book is rife with unflattering references to Jews and Blacks (with the most vile words for each repeatedly used).  Though the characters may be anti-semitic and rascist, it would be unfair to draw the conclusion that Hemingway (or any other author for that matter), agrees with his characters, who are fairly odious and unsympathetic in any event. <br /> <br />2.  One disagreement I have with other reviewers is that Brett and Jake would have found true love and happiness if only Jake could have comsummated the relationship.  First, Brett's modus operandi is to make men fall in love with her, sleep with them, and then dump them, leaving them in shambles.  She likes her power over men even though she's pretty miserable herself.  Second, it seemed to me that Brett kept running back to Jake as a confidante for the very reason that he couldn't sleep with her even though he wanted to.  This was the way she tormented Jake who, despite his knowing better, kept asking for more (Jake would have been a heck of alot better off without any of these people). <br /> <br />3.  The drinking the characters imbibe in is nothing short of insane.  We're talking about two bottles of wine per person in the middle of the day, and that's just getting started.  I wish someone had met or caused some sort of tragic event because her or she was drunk -- then I could be assured that the author doesn't actually approve of it. <br /> <br />4. The only character who had any sense or real moral conscience in the book was a waiter who pointed out to Jake how utterly foolish people were who \\"ran with the bulls,\\" another showcase event of the Fiesta.  The waiter spoke of a young man who died leaving behind a widow and young children.  Finally a consequence! <br /> <br />5.  My biggest criticism of the book was the author's emphasis on the \\"nobility\\" and \\"bravery\\" of bullfighting (at least certain aspects of it).  Basically, this spectacle consists of a matador and his helpers tormenting, torturing and killing a bull for the enjoyment and bloodlust of the audience.  In my opinion, this repulsive \\"sport\\" has absolutely no place in a modern society, and I've come to learn that alot of people, even in Spain, feel the same way.  Yet Hemingway seems to relish it. (I understand he wrote the book in 1926, but still).  <br /> <br />All in all, \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" lost my interest because of the unappealing characters and subject matter.  But then again, Hemingway certainly writes in a unique voice, so that I still found this book worthwhile to read.

He was a complete gentleman and genuine person. He was exactly as I thought he would be. I wish him and his bandmates nothing but the very best from here on in. Carry on!!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|The bullet that exploded John F. Kennedy's head on November 22, 1963 went right on to shatter the hearts of a lot of idealistic kids, mine included. I was a senior in boarding school then, with great grades and a lovely girlfriend and an early guarantee of admission to Harvard. Nothing mattered. A darkness had descended with Kennedy's murder, and it felt as if it was going to be unending.<br /><br />Then The Beatles arrived, and, miraculously, spirits lifted. By March of 1964, 60% of the music sold in America was created by these four Liverpool rockers --- and kids like me were studying their music as if we'd someday have to take an exam on it.<br /><br />If you are a certain age, you know exactly where you were on significant dates: the first time you heard \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" the day they broke up, the night Valdemort killed John Lennon. If you are younger, you just have the music. It's not the same, but it'll do.<br /><br />Whatever your age, it's not likely that that you think of The Beatles often or listen to their music with any frequency. Oh, they're great --- \\"the toppermost of the poppermost,\\" as John used to say --- but they're also known. There's no discovery for us in their music, only nostalgia. And there's no emotion lower than nostalgia.<br /><br />But a few years ago, George Harrison and Guy Laliberte, the founder of Cirque du Soleil, got to talking, and out of that came \\"Love,\\" a visual extravaganza that blends Beatles music and Cirque theatrics. It's playing in Las Vegas now, and the word from friends who have gone is \\"must see.\\"<br /><br />The CD is half of this hybrid. Obviously, it's constructed for dramatic effect --- you know \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" will be saved for the end. But set the visuals aside. Consider this CD strictly as a pastiche of 26 songs, remixed and remastered by legendary Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles. What you get is something completely unexpected.<br /><br />For the Martins do more than remix. They re-imagine. Working with every track the Beatles recorded, they take a few notes from here, a background vocal from there, a snippet of instrumentation, a shard of melody. And when they put it together, they've made something stunning --- a new Beatles CD, The Beatles as you've never heard them before. It's like having your ears power-cleaned and then listening to music for the first time.<br /><br />The CD starts with bird sounds, which lead into \\"Because\\" --- with no instruments, The Beatles singing like a cappella angels. Big spaces between the lines force you to pay close attention. And then rolling thunder sweeps across the horizon, bringing with it drums so sharp they sting and Paul McCartney's vicious guitar; we're into \\"Get Back.\\"<br /><br />If you know The Beatles --- I mean, really know them --- this CD is a puzzle that's hugely fun to crack. Reading the message boards, I see that many are up to the task:<br /><br />The first two tracks incorporate the layered vocals from \\"Because,\\" the nature sounds from \\"Across the Universe,\\" the opening chord from \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" the drum solo from \\"The End,\\" the final piano chord and ascending orchestral line from \\"A Day in the Life,\\" and then the meat of \\"Get Back,\\" which itself segues seamlessly into the middle of \\"Glass Onion,\\" literally without missing a beat. \\"Glass Onion\\" itself contains a few short seconds of \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and melts into an echo-laden treatment of the \\"ahhh\\" vocalization that opens the lyrics of \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\"<br /><br />And more: I've learned that the guitar solo at the end of \\"Drive My Car\\" comes from \\"Taxman.\\" The harpsichord and trumpet at the end of \\"Strawberry Fields\\" was borrowed from \\"In My Life.\\" And the bass at the end of \\"Lady Madonna\\" once lived in \\"Hey Bulldog.\\"<br /><br />The entire CD isn't tricks. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" is buttressed only by the screams of cheering fans --- exactly as we experienced it at Shea Stadiumin that chaotic summer concert. Other songs are simply cleaned up, so you hear every crunch of the strings and every subtle stroke from the underrated Ringo Starr. But even what's left alone is shortened and tightened, just so expertly you can't tell how.<br /><br />The effect? First, you think, \\"What great musicians.\\" And then you think about the nature of great art.

Good luck to the guy tasked with making something exciting out of songs that are --- no matter how popular --- straightforward and literal.<br /><br />And then there's the listener. I sat clutching my iPod for dear life, as if on an acid trip. The metaphor's not just me being groaningly cool --- it's exact. Sounds and colors and ideas fly at you, whipsawing your emotions.

0780626494|4.0|This film, working within the genre of romantic comedy, is actually a knowing, clever take on your typical time traveler story.  Here, of course, the twist is that no one has traveled in time, it just seems that way, given that Brendan Fraser's character has been locked in an elaborate bomb shelter with his parents, hilariously played by veterans Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.<br /><br />Fraser brings a spot-on gleeful tone to his character, as he discovers for the first time the joys of looking at the sun, or jumping in the ocean, or falling in love.  Casting is critical in a romantic comedy, and here the selections are superb -- in addition to Walken and Spacek, you have the very funny Dave Foley, and performing adequately in the romantic lead, Alicia Silverstone.<br /><br />But this is Fraser's show, and as he learns about the mores of modern-day Los Angeles, his journey is our journey, a journey of suburban America and the differences over the last 40 years between our father's generation and our own.<br /><br />This film is guaranteed to put you in a good mood.  Sometimes there are happy endings.

B000AP04OM|5.0|Excellent movie musical with Julie Andrews as the headliner. I first saw this movie when it premiered in \\"Cineramascope\\" on the cinerama sceen, and it is the most memorable movie of that fad era, because that is the way it was meant to be viewed, and should be watched. I am so glad home theater sceens are accomodating those vibrant additives to give todays audience a chance to see how some of these movies worked. It was absolutely incredible to recall the giant size visions of the convent interiors, and deluxe \\"mountainous\\" scenery. The sights of seeing our beloved Julie dance, hop, skip, and jump throughout the movie with seven, (yes, seven), children next to her heels is a must see. I am not much of a complainer for intricate drivel or criticism, as long as the general feel of the movie produced is well worth the size of entertainment it gives in no uncertain terms. (This includes low-budget theater).<br />On another note, the available soundtrack to The Sound Of Music is pretty much a necessity if one is to grasp the stereo scope of the music output. It gives another dimension to relate to the magnificence of this feature. And the cover photo of this product says it all!

I've told everyone I know that they have to read it but be sure to have some kleenex near by.  It's a real tear jerker.
B00005JPFO|5.0|This movie is awesome. i have to agree with some of the other reviwers. you comic book geeks judge these movies so hard. they won't always be true to the books. hey, at least they did it right on how Johnny Blaze became GhostRider, unlike The Hulk, if you know what i mean. the hulk would've been better if they did it the right way on how bruce became the hulk. but the point is just don't be so quick to judge at least they came close. If they keep on making superhero movies i'll go see them. Nichlos cage was awesome in this movie, this was the best one he did since Face/Off. The special effcts were awesome. i loved the way they did his transformation. This film is not good for kids under the age of 12. and i thought the actor who played Blackheart was cool, to bad they didn't make him the big purple monster we all love to hate. he looked the part. i also thought that peter fonda was excellent has mephisto. i beat the soundtrack, video game and book will be good. thats about it<br /><br />peace out<br /><br />if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do

B000BJS4OY|5.0|Since reviews of the content of BTR are plentiful, I will limit my comments to helping you decide whether to purchase the original recording, or this box set.<br /><br />Others have focused on the two bonus DVDs, so I won't cover those here.  Instead, let's focus on the remastered CD.<br /><br />There are several improvements over the original recording, including:<br />1. Noise (tape hiss) is now almost inaudible.  Noise was significant on the original (1983) CD release.<br />2. Greatly expanded definition in the upper frequencies - you can now hear the high harmonics on the piano and glockenspiel.  These were very muddy in the 1983 release.<br />3. The bass is much \\"punchier\\".  It's not just louder, it is tighter and more well-defined.<br /><br />So, while the \\"Wall of Sound\\" production value is preserved, the listener has a much better chance to pick out individual instruments on this relase.<br /><br />In the end, are the improvements worth the additional cost?  It's always a judgement call, but here are couple of guidelines that may help you decide.<br /><br />If you use a digital music player, such as an iPod, check the settings you use to rip music from your CD collection.  If you use the (iTunes default) sample rate of 128k, and you don't have any complaints about the sound quality of your collection, then you should be fine with the 1983 release.  Save yourself a few bucks.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you have upped the bit rate to something higher than 128k, then your ears are a little more finely tuned than most, and you would be able to appreciate the improvements in sound quality that the remastered version offers.<br /><br />All in all, the engineers did a fine job with remastering this classic album; it's up to you to decide if the improvements are worth the extra dough.
0451528956|4.0|I have known about the basics of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story for as long as I can remember.  This book has built an image over the years of being a classic tale of horror and fills the mind with many images. Yet actually, when I made the effort to sit down and read the book, it has a different affect. The writing and sequence of events in the book is pretty fragmented in many places. The book reads much more like a short story than a classic novel. Thus while reading the book, and certainly after completing the book, you can't help but to think of all the things and events that could have been added to the book to make it that classic novel that you originally envisioned. This book is certainly worth reading if anything just for the sake of Stevenson's perspective on the duality of man in the 19th century. Yet, take the book for what it is and don't set your expectations too high.

B0009RCPY8|5.0|Since these movies came out in 1983 and 1989, before my youngest son was born, he had somehow missed out on seeing Ghostbusters.  While he had seen the second film, he had not seen the first.  And for me, I did not remember the second installment being nearly as much fun as the first.  So, when I saw this set with the two of them, I bought it.  It is a terrific set and has a nice little booklet with some of drawings and sketches that were done to originate the ideas for the first Ghostbusters.<br /><br />The first movie was a sensation.  The title song was remarkable and was the song of 1984.  The exuberance of the actors, their chemistry, and the downright strangeness of the story delighted nearly everyone and if my youngest son's reaction is representative of young people today, it is still a great deal of fun.  Yes, the effects look much cheesier than they did in 1983 (the year the film was made) before CGI took over effects in film.<br /><br />It is also fun to watch the film with the commentary and learn more about how the story evolved from Ackroyd's original treatment and what went on in making the movie.  Some of the classic lines of the film were improvised or were done by the actor.  For example, Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) line to Venkman (Bill Murray) that he didn't seem like a scientist, that he seemed more like a game show host was perfect and supplied by Weaver.  The original line given her was more hackneyed, that Venkman seemed more like a used car salesman.  The difference is one is fresh and memorable the other would just be lost in the rest of the movie.<br /><br />There is so much that is wonderful in the first Ghostbusters that it is impossible to list them all.  We all have our favorite moments and as we watch the movie we are reminded of more that we really like.  Just for fun, look up the cast on IMDB and see what they have all done since.  It is quite an interesting exercise.<br /><br />The second film was inevitable given the success of the first.  The domestic box office was $231 million and worldwide it was $291 million for the first movie.<br /><br />However, I remember feeling that Ghostbusters 2 was a bit of a disappointment.  The music wasn't very good (the Bobby Brown stuff was terrible!) and the story seemed too much a sermon instead of the best story they could invent (but maybe it was).  As I watched it again after all these years, I have to say that it was better than I remembered.  Yes, the Bobby Brown stuff and the rap crap are still awful, but I can look past that.<br /><br />The beginning picks up five years after the other filmed ended.  They are on hard times.  Ray and Winston are doing kids parties for extra cash.  As they do a little dance to the Ghostbusters theme from the first movie and come to \\"Who ya gonna call?\\" the kids shout back \\"HE MAN!\\".  Quite deflating for the boys.  Ray also has an Occult / Paranormal bookstore.  Egon is doing research about on how emotions affect the human environment.  Venkman has a cable access show interviewing paranormal nutjobs.  And Dana is working at a museum because she has a young baby, Oscar, and can't travel with the orchestra.<br /><br />We get introduced to the main idea of the film when Dana rolls Oscar's baby carriage through some goo on the sidewalk (who would notice in 1980s New York?).  When she stops to talk with someone the carriage starts moving on its own!<br /><br />I did enjoy many of the scenes.  The digging in the street, the courtroom scene, the ghost train.  It is all quite funny.  Yes, it is very tough to surprise and delight the way the first film did, but there is a lot to enjoy.  But whomever it was that insisted on Bobby Brown should still be taken outback and given a stern lecture about how bad an idea that was.<br /><br />There are also two shorts about the first film.  One from 1984 and the other more recent.  Both are very interesting.  There are also some deleted scenes and it is clear why they weren't included.<br/><br />One great comedy, one good comedy, and some nice extras in this fine two DVD set.ey weren't included. <br /> <br />One great comedy, one good comedy, and some nice extras in this fine two DVD set.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I came looking just for a pleasant romantic comedy. It is more than pleasant, it is loving and kind and inspiring. It delivers fireworks and teary eyes of joy.  It started off pleasant enough and then moved into many more levels. What a wonderful way to spend some time! Good music, good lyrics, good acting, good script adds up to a great movie!
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I'm not going to relate the story - only post my thoughts on the movie. <br /> <br />I liked it. I think everyone can identify with the problems the main characters faced. Life is hard. Life is lost jobs, disappointment - a never ending stream of problems. I think even the richest of rich people among us experience it, but especially those that are struggling financially. For them, the emotional struggle and wounds that can be left from years and even decades of struggling can be an overwhelming psychological experience. <br /> <br />The movie was quite popular and I sensed that everyone enjoyed it.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|`the lake house', directed by Alejandro Agresti, reunites Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in the lead roles, for the first time since they appeared in the action movie `Speed'. And, in a strange way, this movie is as unusual as a romantic comedy as `Speed' was as an action movie, since both movies are based on unusual premises.<br /><br />The assumption, no surprise to anyone who has seen the trailer, is that the Bullock (Kate Foster, a doctor fresh out of residency) and Reeves (Alex Wyler, a building contract supervisor) characters both occupy the same house set upon stilts just off the shore of a small lake somewhere within easy driving distance of Chicago, except that Wyler occupies it in 2004 and Forster occupies it in 2006. The two communicate across this span of two years by leaving letters in the lake house's mailbox. And, the characters realize this little temporal anomaly quickly, about 20 minutes into the movie. What the trailer doesn't reveal (but which does not do much to give things away) is the fact that this lake house was originally built by Wyler's father, a famous architect, played by Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />The story is so simple and the characters are so few, I am hard pressed to find interesting things about the film without giving away a major part of the plot. One thing I can say is that the time travel aspect of the time shift premise is so subdued, one gets absolutely no sense this is remotely like any `science fiction' or even `Twilight Zone' type of story. It is far more like some Cary Grant romantic story from the 1940s or 1930s, where two characters are supposed to meet at the top of the Empire State Building, but one of the two characters never shows up.<br /><br />One thing the time travel premise does do is eliminate any sense that this is a `romantic comedy'. There are some light-hearted moments, but it is not really much more amusing than `Love Story' or `The Paper Chase'. It is certainly not in the same comedy class as `The Wedding Crashers' or `The Breakup'. Another thing the time travel scenario does is make your head hurt when you try to work out the classic time travel paradoxes, when the two characters do meet in circumstances where the later character, Forster (Bullock) encounters the earlier character, Wyler (Reeves) and Forster is not aware of the cross-temporal communication, since it hasn't happened (for her) yet. Again, fortunately, the time travel hypothesis is well downplayed you hardly notice the anomalies.<br /><br />One thing for sure is that this movie `works' as a romantic story. By the time we are halfway through the flick, we really want them to get together and are frustrated when they can't seem to figure out the obvious solution to the problem and actually get together. When they do set a plan in motion, we are genuinely distressed when it doesn't work out. Even more distressing is the suspicion of why the meeting did not work out.<br /><br />The side stories involving Wyler's father and brother and Forster's job and boyfriend are lightly done, just enough to distract us for a bit from the main story line without taking on too much substance and stealing from the romance.<br /><br />One of the more interesting little conceits is the fact that the two main characters end up adopting the same stray dog, who then succeeds in occupying scenes in both 2004 and 2006. The curious thing is that said dog doesn't appear in the final scene... I guess that would have been stretching the old space-time continuum just a bit too far! I'm also just a tad disappointed that there is no hint of explanation for why these two people should find themselves in this situation at these particular times, but then we would start getting into `Twilight Zone' territory, and there is really no need to go there. It contributes nothing to the love story.<br /><br />So, it would have been nice to have a director's or writer's voice-over commentary to give us some of this stuff, but there is none, reducing somewhat the rewatchability of the flick. But, if you need a good date movie, this one is a winner.<br /><br />Note that I strongly suspect the widescreen version is highly recommended here. I saw the 'full screen' version, and definitely sensed I was missing some things.t there is none, reducing somewhat the rewatchability of the flick.

6301969588|5.0|Don't let the grisly climax fool you. This may be one of the most humane movies on record. These are real side-show \\"freaks\\" and no matter how distubing, using anything less would have produced a real travesty. Of course, watching this array of human deformity takes some getting used to-- the pin-heads, the human torso, the truncated man, the human toothpick, the dwarves, and all the others. But once you get past the revulsion,  there's fascination, then compassion, and finally (I think) normal acceptance. They are, after all, as human as the rest of us, and it's to Browning's everlasting credit that he leads us through such stages without pity or condescension. The real monsters, of course, are the two pretty people who show their inner deformity by abusing these human unfortunates.     Not everything, however, is praiseworthy. Trapeze artist Baclanova and her strongman  overact shamelessly. Their hammed up gestures almost bring down the entire proceedings, and  I can't help wondering why Browning let them get so out of hand. Also, chronic stutterer Roscoe Ates, whose speech problem is not really so funny when you think about it, is put to dubious effect as comic relief. But these are small potatoes when contrasted with the unique overall effect.    What really surprises me is that this movie curiosity comes from the unlikeliest of sources, Louis B. Mayer's MGM. This so-called Tiffany of studios always prided itself on pretty people, big rooms, and wholesome entertainment. No wonder they pulled the film and stripped off their logo after seeing the on-screen result. This is a long, long way from Andy Hardy and Carverville, USA. I gather it was Irving Thallberg, head of production, who pushed the project over Mayer's objections. Perhaps it was the precarious state of his own health that gave him the compassionate drive necessary to complete such a dubious oddity. Nonetheless, whatever the source or reason, this is truly a one-of-a-kind movie experience and not to bemissed.
B00004R99U|5.0|I have to say that I really love Pocahontas movies by Disney eventhough they have been romanticised which attracted loads of criticisms.  They have captivated our (all generations) imagination with the most engaging historical and story-telling approaches on the life of Pocahontas.  I don't think I would spend hours and hours researching on her journey if I didn't watch these movies. <br /> <br />I notice that lots of people have complained about the graphic/visual quality of this particular movie.  Shall I remind them that this movie is produced on a direct-to-video term.  Due to a much lower budget, which is very much obvious in most sequel Disney and other movies anyway, it makes sense that the graphic/visual quality found in Pocahontas II is already expected.  Therefore, I wouldn't bother comparing this with the first Pocahontas movie which is why so many people are upset to find the sequel didn't sweep them off their feet like the first one did. <br /> <br />Anyway, now to the music.  The varieties of music here is limited (again due to budget
B000002UCE|5.0|An important element of the success of John Lennon's second solo effort, IMAGINE, was the musicians who assisted in this project: George Harrison, King Curtis, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voorman, Jim Keltner, Alan White, Joey & Tommy Badfinger, Jim Gordon, Mike Pinder and others contributed their talents to the sessions.<br /><br />As on his first album, Lennon explored his concerns and pain on IMAGINE, (minus the scream therapy). He also expressed the love in his heart and his optimism for the future.

014100018X|5.0|This is the kind of book that is so magical, so quietly excellent that it leaves you daydreaming about it for days after you finish it.  Sometimes you need a book like that, one that carries you away to an interesting place, where bad things may happen, but where the author treats you, the reader, gently.  This is the book that will fill that need, and send you floating off to the kitchen to bake the most superb thing you've ever created --without even looking at a recipe. <br /> <br />I confess I am biased about Chocolat.  I read this book while undergoing chemotherapy for BC.  I was in the middle of the treatments and the drugs left me with a persistent metallic taste in my mouth which no flavor could penetrate.  After three months of tasting nothing by metal, I confess I was feeling a bit low.  And then, my darling Joanne Harris saved me with her quietly wonderful book.  I read it, nibbling on a chocolate bar of the best quality I could find. (Lake Champlain Chocolates, Dark!) I didn't taste the chocolate of course, but my spirit didn't need it, as the book and it buoyed me enough.
B000G7PMD2|3.0|Well...maybe. <br />I don't feel this live album is up to par with all the hype around this show. <br /> <br />Seeing them live (open for Megadeth) thats where I became a fan. I must say they put on a really good show. <br /> <br />In short...the vocals seem a little weak (Like the majority of most live albums, I've gotten bootlegs that are better).  And for the price, the unreleased material, it isn't worth it.  A live album is supposed to capture the energy of the band. <br />Sepultura - Under A Gray Pale Sky, Metallica - S&M & Pantera - 101 Proof & Rammstein - Live Aus Berlin; all come to mind. And that is what this album is missing, energy. It lacks energy very much. <br /> <br />I have to agree with another reviewer. This live album is pre-mature.  <br />They have put out 3 studio albums in the last 6 years. Most of that material is on this album. They really should have waited a few more years. So I'm gonna just stick to there studio release for now.

0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris writes very convincingly about the need for an end to faith, largely because all forms of faith--including moderate ones--lead to false conclusions and unreasonable claims.

His language, more often than not, is loaded, but then, his intention appears not to be objective.
B000GRU6XS|2.0|I'd tend to think it's just me but I've been listening to Maiden for 15+ yrs by now and have seen them loads in concert so I feel comfortable saying: How could this song get 5 stars for a Maiden song? And why does the country of England love the new album so much that it is like the Seventh Son thing all over again? I guess i'm the one not in on the joke but I think this album does not even hold a candle to the last 2 (Dance of Death & Brave New World). This sounds like Maiden is out of steam and i'd swear people are only raving about this new release just due to the fact that the artwork is somewhat tolerable compared to the last 2 releases (who would of thought that a prize possesion like \\"Eddie\\" could be thrown around so carelessly to half as talented artists)?<br /><br />I would suggest buying virtually ANY other Maiden cd (w/ the exception of the forgettable '95 - '00 yrs). I really don't understand all the accolades for this one. And to pull this entire album off live in concert? There were alot of angry fans in the Chicago audience I'll tell ya that. Never thought they would of gotten flicked off by an audience member that paid a fortune but that's how it went. Sorry to burst the 5 star bubbles but I had to throw in my two cents as alongtime devoted Maiden fan. PS - the new Derek Riggs book rules!! Up the Irons!
B00003CXMG|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it showed me the music in American cities that we only read about in Melody Maker and Rolling Stone. I was mighty impressed that Peter Frampton helped to keep the '70's music sound real and Still Water lived the dream. Kate Hudson is a babe but most of all life on the road in the States was much as I imagined. How good that some one recreated the Riot House I now think I've been there. We had our top rock venues here in Manchester(and still do) but this film captures the magic of a musical generation that no one appears to be able to compete with anymore.

B00006WKSZ|5.0|I love this album, but I must say that I do not like one thing about the CD release: It does not contain \\"POLAR NIGHTS\\", a song with Uli Jon Roth on vocals!  I had (and still have) the original double album and POLAR NIGHTS is on the album, but not the CD.  WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?  IS IT AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD SOMEWHERE?<br /><br />This album captures the Scorpions before they hit big in the States, although San Antonio, Texas rock station KISS (RIP, Joe Anthony)was playing Scorpions music for quite some time. I was 13 or 14 when I first heard of the Scorpions and this was the first stuff I ever heard from them and I was BLOWN AWAY!  Almost 30 years later, this stuff STILL blows me away!<br /><br />Uli Jon Roth has obvious Hendrix influences, as evidenced in his playing,  but is no copycat.  He holds his own quite well and is a genuine pleasure to listen to!  Klaus used to scream back then and sounded awesome and, in my humble opinion, never quite sounded that good again (after the Lovedrive album), with the \\"Lovedrive\\" album having that same type of scream from his vocals. The rest of the band sounds very good and I am finally happy to have added this to my CD collection, but the only thing that could beat it would be a DVD video of this performance or anything else from that era, if it exists.<br /><br />However, one of the most interesting things about the album is the cover, specifically, the guitar player's feet (can't really tell who it is, maybe Rudolph Schenker?)! I showed it to my 12 year old daughter and she said \\"COOL!\\"<br /><br />What more can I say?  If you don't have it, then get it!
B000IY042C|5.0|Rammstein would be a great band with music alone, but it's the live performances and pyrotechnics that make them near-legendary. In their last tour, they somehow managed to top their signature head-mounted flamethrowers by having vocalist Till Lindeman \\"roast\\" keyboardist Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz in a giant cauldron. Simply unbelievable. <br /> <br />Note that all current DVD versions of Volkerball are in PAL format, so US buyers need either to buy a multi-region DVD player, or (if you're cheap like me) spend a good number of hours re-authoring the videos into NTSC format. Either option is well worth it, though.
B00005NVDI|2.0|As the 3rd and final season quickly comes to an end, I'm left unsurprised that Classic Trek got axed at this season's end.  After a long string of poor and uninspiring episodes (where had all the great scriptwriters gone after the first two seasons?) this volume is just the next installment of forgettable drivel.  The first episode is just very, very poor with terrible scriptwriting and Spock is inexplicably made out to be some obnoxious old maid with pms.  The overall dialogue is very poor and the story is just plain stupid.  Why wouldn't a force strong enough to send the Enterprise 1000 light years away just simply destroy the Enterprise right away instead of playing games with the crew is unexplained.  Why would the computer have to make replicas of Lee Meriwether specifically for individual crew members without being able to kill at will is another ridiculous failing of the plot.  I can safely say that this episode \\"That Which Survives\\" is one of the worst 3 episodes in the entire classic trekdom.<br /><br />The second episode is an interesting fable about racial discrimination and intolerance which pricks the conscience and successfully achieves its intention of provoking discomfort among its viewers to look at themselves to see if they are guilty of similar actions themselves.  The script is quite good and the acting is good as well and not as bad as the other reviewers have made it out to be.  This episode ranks among the better ones of season 3 as well.<br /><br />Overall, we have one horribly bad and one average episode putting this volume under the \\"give it a miss\\" category if you are deciding which volumes to collect.
B0000057D8|5.0|These recordings are excellent. Pinnock's Brandenburg concertos remain the standard for period instruments, offering an exceptional combination of musicality and authenticity. The Overtures are also well-done, although I still prefer the readings of Reinhard Goebel and Musica Antiqua Koln to these. Still, as a low-priced compilation of Bach's most popular orchestral works, this is an excellent set, and you could do much worse. Those who are new to classical music will find this set to be a great starting point.  As far as interpretation goes, Pinnock's ensemble features fast tempi but never to the point of sounding ridiculous; these are not \\"authentic for the sake of authentic\\" performances at all. The one notable exception is the slightly rushed opening of Overture No. 2, although this is not detrimental to the final product. The English Concert plays these works with great joy - listen to Brandenburg Concertos Nos. 2 & 3 in particular - but also with great respect. I have heard too many original instruments ensembles whip through these pieces as if they are burlesques, with overly blatty horns and sloppy out-of-synch strings, which I believe is insulting to Bach's legacy. This isn't pub music; things like tasteful phrasing and accenting don't need to be ignored just because a recording is \\"historically-informed\\". One final item worthy of note is Pinnock's abilities as a harpsichordist. His solo at the end of the first movement of Brandenburg No. 5 is the finest rendition I have heard, period. The only slight misfire in my opinion is Brandenburg No. 6; Pinnock takes the first movement a little too fast, and the viola da gambas sound just a little too urgent. I prefer some more space in this movement. That said, the next two movements are very fine and more than make up for it. For this concerto, I prefer the sublime 6th from [[ASIN:B0000029VS Gustav Leonhardt's]] fine set.   In spite of the fact that the Brandenburg concertos were recorded using early digital technology, the DG engineers got it right and everything is presented in fine detail, right down to the harpsichord continuo. It seems as though the intimate settings of these small ensembles neutralized many of the problems of hollow, tinny sound that plagued the digital format in its early years. As for the Orchestral Suites, these were recorded using late 70's/early 80's analog technology and sound just as good, if not better than the Brandenburgs, with just a touch more brightness.  These recordings are integral for those who prefer period instrument performances, and this is one of the great pioneering period instrument ensembles out there. Recommended.
B00004TA41|5.0|Well titled album, as it is out there. This is not your standard jazz album.  Takes real attentive listening to understand the overall spatial concepts of each song.  I've only listened to it a couple times and still feel like I don't have a handle on everything.  So far, it sounds great...coltrane is a genius.
B00004SAAY|5.0|This set of concertos, paired with the Brandenburg Concertos/Overtures compilation from Arkiv (also featuring Pinnock and the English Concert), gives any new Bach fan a fairly complete account of Bach's instrumental orchestral output. This package includes all of Bach's harpsichord concertos, violin concertos, and assorted concertos for two and three soloists. Highlights are the D Minor Harpsicord concerto BWV 1052, the C Major concerto for 2 Harpsicords BWV 1061, the A Major Harpsichord concerto BWV 1055, the A Minor triple concerto BWV 1044, the C Minor double concerto BWV 1060, and the violin concertos.  As with all of Pinnock's Bach recordings, tempi are swift but never sound rushed; phrasing and accenting are ideal. Pinnock and the English Concert clearly have great respect for Bach's works, and they obviously enjoy playing them.  This set is a mix of analog and digital recordings. However regardless of the recording format, everything sounds excellent and you most likely will not be able to tell the difference. Strongly recommended for those who loved Bach's Brandenburg concertos and Overtures and are looking for something new to sink their teeth into.
1932907009|5.0|In December, an LA producer with many credits told me to read this book before I wrote my next screenplay.  AND to follow the beat sheet exactly.  He said many of his producing friends specifically look for each of these beats at the right moments in scripts they consider. <br /> <br />My only mistake was waiting to read this book until this month.  Personally I think pages 65-90 are pure gold.  I took my latest script, completely broke it down and re-outlined it with Blake's 15 point beat sheet.  Here's the thing, I had most of the pieces to the puzzle in the script.  BUT IT WASN'T enough.  It was close and \\"close\\" always gets me a \\"nice pass\\" in LA.  I'm so tired of those \\"nice passes.\\"   <br /> <br />There were three or four key elements missing from my script.  AND, there were three or four elements I had that were in the WRONG  place in the script.  I highlighted and marked the heck out of this book.  If you're tired of hearing producer after producer say, \\"This is good, but it's not right for us.  Send us your next script...\\"  THEN Do yourself a favor, buy this book.  It will change the way you write the day you finish it.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Okay. I absolutely love the book and have read it more times than I should admit, and I love the miniseries which did a wonderful job at capturing the essence of the book, but this movie is just AWFUL. It leaves out detail after detail and rushes you from one event to the next never giving the viewer a full explanation or even time to form any opinions. The characters in the movie do not seem fully developed; they are like chess pieces being moved by a higher power without knowing its or their intention.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: this movie is a shell of the book. It should never have been made. And I feel the only people who can find true enjoyment in this adaptation are those who have never read Austen's masterpiece.

1582701709|5.0|You don't need this book.  You already know everything you need to know to be wise and prosperous.  It's already inside of you.  Everyone is looking for some magic formula which will allow them to be happy and successful.  We all believe that there is some \\"secret of life\\" that we need to plug into, and then our fears and angst will disappear and we will glide effortlessly through the cosmos into blissful well-being. <br /> <br />Well, look no further.  I am going to reveal to you the Ultimate Secret, and it is not going to cost you a penny!  Are you ready?  Here it is:  The secret of life is...  that THERE IS NO SECRET!   <br /> <br />It sounds like pablum doesn't it?  But only about 5% of the people who read this are going to understand it and believe it.  I challenge you to embrace this thought and analyze it.  Take it to its logical conclusion, and when you can truly accept this wisdom, you will be able to shed your fears and angst.  You may not reach a point where you feel that you are gliding effortlessly through the cosmos, but you will be well on the path toward that utopia.  And you will resonate with a happiness you never before thought possible. <br /> <br />I am a firm believer in the Law of Attraction.  And I am a devout believer that we are all exactly where we are supposed to be.  We truly do create our own destiny.  We are always at a place which has been created by the sum total of our thoughts and actions to this point in time.  I will take this dictum a step further: We are all exactly where we WANT to be! <br /> <br />You say, \\"But I want to be a medical doctor, and I am not there!\\"  I answer, \\"You would be there if you had taken the appropriate actions and trained your thinking to be there.  You would have studied what you needed in school to prepare yourself for college and then medical school -- if you truly wanted to be a doctor.\\" <br /> <br />You say, \\"But I wanted to be a professional basketball player!\\"  I answer, \\"If you truly wanted that, you would have spent all your waking hours practicing dribbling, passing, shooting, and studying court and team dynamics.\\" <br /> <br />You see, its really that simple.  There is no secret other than focusing on a goal and then doing what it takes to get there.  Most of us, however, find it far too easy to be lazy and then believe the excuses that we provide for ourselves. <br /> <br />No, you don't need this book.  It's philosophy can be summed up quite robustly in one, simple, Biblical phrase: \\"As ye sow, so shall ye reap.\\"  This is the Law of Attraction, and it truly works.  It's not magic and it's not a secret.  It is a universal, irrefutable, and immutable principle.  If you bequeath peace and harmony to those around you, you will recieve peace and harmony.  If you disseminate good will and love, you will be blessed with good will and love.  If, however, you emanate ill-will and a cynical attitude, that is what you will receive from the world. <br /> <br />No, you don't need this book... but I highly recommend it.  You see, as simple as it is to get what we want out of life, we have to overcome all of our past conditioning, all of our negativiy, and all of the bad habits we have spent a lifetime to form.  It's very simple, but it is anything but easy!  This book will help you to condition your toughts to break your inertia and get rid of bad habits of thought.   <br /> <br />Start with this book as your point of departure into a new conciousness, a new awareness, and a new philosophy of life.  Then read some of the other excellent books which other reviewers have recommended.  You will find that it is easier to be a benfactor than a burden.  Offer the best of yourself to the world, and then prepare yourself to receive in abundance!
0316926345|3.0|Rather a lot of people died rather horribly in the two World Wars. But to read Waugh's novel, you'd think that the greatest single tragedy these conflicts brought about was that his posh friends were deprived of their expensive houses. <br /> <br />Advice for aspiring novelists: if you're A) a genuinely gifted prose stylist, and B) an utterly repulsive specimen of humanity, it's best to steer away from writing thinly veiled autobiography. <br /> <br />Also, if you decide to ignore the above advice, don't try to exculpate yourself by twittering on about how you've Found Jesus. <br />
B000I5Y8XM|5.0|Of her solo CD's, this is perhaps Moya's most fluid and uplifting.  It has the same contemplative feel as Two Horizons and Whisper to the Wild Waters, yet there is a deeper sense of 'flow' in this ensemble of tunes; a spiritul 'movement' enlivens the CD from beginning to end.  The sound occasionally reminds me of Clannad's in their most mature phase (Sirius - Legend).  There is a sense of joy in this music that is reminiscent of Perfect Time.  An excellent album; I play it every day.
B000002KMY|4.0|Hell, yeah! This record totally rules! The second album of the Dio-era Sabbath, \\"The Mob Rules\\" has grown to become one of Sabbath's, if not hard rock's true masterpieces. Recorded and released in 1981, barely a year after \\"Heaven and Hell\\", the album features the basic axis of singer Ronnie James Dio, guitarist Tony Iommi and bassist Geezer Butler joined for the first time by drummer Vinnie Appice taking over from original drummer Bill Ward, who left the band during the previous tour, physically and emotionally drained over years of substance abuse and the departure of original singer Ozzy Osbourne a couple of years earlier.<br /><br />For this second outing, the band went in a heavier direction, no doubt influenced by the heavier style of playing of their new drummer, whose sound is much more \\"heavy metal\\" than Bill Ward's style of hard rock, based on blues and jazz. The record features 9 heavy tracks, including a moody, gloomy, synthesizer based instrumental \\"E5150\\" that serves as little more than an introduction for the title track, and quite honestly, is unnecessary and a bit annoying for my taste. But the remaining 8 tracks are skull bashing: opener \\"Turn up the Night\\" is fast and furious, a great opening track; \\"Voodoo\\" is a heavy, mid tempo number with a repetitive guitar riff that really gets stuck in your brain; the title track is also a fast and heavy number which is driven by its massive drum work and extremely potent riff.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with \\"Country Girl\\", another heavy mid tempo rocker with a very cool interlude in the middle that is totally unexpected; \\"Slipping Away\\" picks the tempo up somewhat, boasting a terrific guitar/bass dueling solo and a bone crunching main riff, which again goes to show you how heavy this record is; \\"Falling off the edge of the World\\" sounds as if the band had 3 different bits of songs and stuck them together, starting with a slow and quiet intro, going into a heavy, slow transition and finally exploding into full gear, making the proverbial square peg fit into the round hole; closing number \\"Over and Over\\" is a slow, heavy tune which can remind you a little to \\"Dirty Women\\" because of its structure and long soloing outro. But above all, \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is the set's crown jewel, a slow, epic song in the vein of \\"Heaven and Hell\\" that showcases some of Ronnie's finest lyrics and vocals.<br /><br />The band is at the top of their game, reinvigorated by its newer members: Ronnie James Dio is a singer's singer, unquestionably one of the best, if not THE best hard rock singer ever; Iommi sounds dark and dangerous, as usual, and his solos have a stinging quality to them that is nothing short of chilling; Geezer always shines with his thunderous, earth shaking style of playing, and Appice definitely pushes the band into a harder, more metal direction. That's not necessarily a good thing depending on your particular tastes, but it's great for me. In a way, I like this record better that \\"Heaven and Hell\\" because of the added heaviness.<br /><br />So why am I rating it with 4 stars (ooh, all right, let's say 4 and a ½...) as opposed to 5, like I did with \\"Heaven and Hell\\"? you might ask. Well, the reason is simple: as much as I love the songs and the added heaviness, I think that Sabbath played it a little safe with this one, trying to come up with a record that would appeal to all the people who loved \\"Heaven and Hell\\", so both records end up being a little too similar: both of them begin with a fast and heavy song (\\"Neon Knights - Turn up the Night), both albums feature a big, slow epic (Heaven and Hell - The Sign of the Southern Cross), both albums close with a slow, long song with a long guitar outro (Lonely is the Word - Over and Over) and fill in the blanks with mid-tempo rockers. I believe that a lot of this had to do with the producer, Martin Birch, who did exactly the same for Rainbow with their first and third album, which mirror eachother almost to perfection. And that's a problem, because it inspires comparisons. And if you must compare, the truth is that \\"The Mob Rules\\" ends up sounding a little less original, a little less groundbreaking, with a little less spark and a little more \\"play it safe\\" attitude than its monstrous predecessor. And I guess people picked up on that, too, since the album was a hit, but a far cry from achieving the \\"all time hard rock masterpiece\\" status of \\"Heaven and Hell\\".<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line is: if you enjoyed \\"Heaven and Hell\\", you'll enjoy this one. For want of an analogy, \\"The Mob Rules\\" is to Black Sabbath what \\"For Those About to Rock\\" is to AC/DC: the follow-up to a classic masterpiece that could never hope to match its predecessor but probably deserves greater praise than it has received. If you're new to the Dio-era Sabbath, you're better off starting with \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and then move on from there. And one last note: the import versions of the Dio-era Sabbath catalog released by Castle have been remastered and feature longer fades (just a few more seconds, though...) and liner notes, which make them the superior choice over the Warner versions.And that's a problem, because it inspires comparisons.

B00008PC2O|1.0|I only bought this dvd so I could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in HD (WMVHD) but since I don't live in the US I could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid DRM bullcrap they encoded the movie with. After weeks of trying different things I finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green. <br /> <br />STAY FAR AWAY. Don't buy DRM encoded stuff
0743298020|5.0|I recently went on a road trip and downloaded this book onto my MP3 because I get motion sickness.  I regret not coming up with the idea sooner.  What a way to \\"read\\" a book!  I couldn't stop listening to this story and was immediately reminded of V.C. Andrews and her Flowers in the Attic series.  I would have liked to have read this and maybe, down the road, I will.  But hearing the story really brought it to life.  I recommend this book or audio to anyone looking for something with a twist.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|It's not uncommon to see a movie with a huge cast of great actors, but when they're each at the top of their game, there's nothing like it.<br /><br />There isn't much more to be said, most people already know this movie has been a big hit. It's really just a matter of seeing it yourself. It's so rare to see a movie this well-made, that you really owe it to yourself to see it.  Also, for a movie of its length, it really flies by. It has no slow points, unnecessary points, or insignificant points.<br /><br />Truly a masterpiece from every angle - make sure you give it a look before someone slips and lets out the ending at oscar time.
0553573411|5.0|Again, as with Assassin's Apprentice, I was held fast by a story that constantly kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. This series is just stunning in the ability to hold my attention and keep me wondering all day exactly where Robin Hobb is taking her characters. Every time I think I know, the outcome is exactly the opposite of what I had predicted. Sometimes it is difficult, even sad, to read this book because you desperately want something good, something he deserves to happen to FitzChivalry, and it almost never does. I'm very eager to begin the third installment in the series.

It was a perfect evening... Thanks to Vin and Amazon for such a wonderful opportunity.
0790738139|4.0|The film opens in 1950s Los Angeles and introduces the people in this story. There is a pot bust of two minor movie stars, well planned to provide headlines. Some men are arrested for assaulting two policemen, and many officers beat them as summary punishment. Photographs of this create a scandal. The meeting tells how the deal is done: some win, some lose, and justice is done. Standards will be upheld for the future. There are two gunmen who are bumping off Mickey Cohen's gang members. Then there is a slaughter of people at a late-night restaurant. A senseless killing or a planned rub-out? <br /> <br />The police investigate those connected to the people killed at the restaurant. Suspects are arrested, they have to get them to talk about what they did. Various methods are used. They get a lead and find another suspect. Detective White stops another criminal. Then the three suspects escape somehow. They are tracked down and a shoot-out finishes them off. \\"Shotgun Ed\\" wins an award for heroism. We see how a reformer politician can change his mind about a highway project. There is a plot to embarrass the D.A. by getting a young actor to meet him. When Detective Vincennes shows up he finds the young actor dead! Detective White follows up on Susan Lefferts and finds something in her Mom's basement. Exley and Vincennes investigate another case. Exley visits White's girlfriend and learns more about her. Vincennes makes an error in judgment, his last. Then pictures are given to White to enrage him. Exley does research on the murdered former cop Meeks who was found in the basement. Exley and White talk to the D.A. and get him to cooperate. Dudley Smith and Patchett may be in cahoots. <br /> <br />Someone calls Exley and White to arrange them to meet at a motel; this is a trap. [All those shots and no one to hear them?] The two detectives hold off their attackers. There is a final resolution to the conflicts at the ending. Exley tells the facts about the crimes, there will be another cover-up, and another award for Lt. Exley. A happy ending? Sensational action masks a weak story. <br /> <br />Scenes take place at night since outdoor scenes would show present-day LA. The film did not create the LA of 50 years earlier. It is loosely based on some real events from that era. One book about the \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\" said newspapers and reporters cooperated in the 1940s, there would be no embarrassing pictures then. The ruling powers wanted new highways, no blackmail was needed. One anachronism was the powered garage door of Patchett. A real history book will give the facts about LA in that time, it would be better than fiction. Is the film better than the novel? <br />
0618680004|2.0|Richard Dawkins proved to me with this book that nobody can be inspired and transformed by atheism, scientifically enlightened, yes, but contented in soul and sound in spirit, no. <br /> <br />Atheism is a negation, not a positive affirmation of Something or Someone. Who then can be poetic or wildly passionate about a Great Nothing? World religions have inspired extraordinary symphonies, paintings, statues, poetry, sacred and secular texts, and yes, even encouraged research and scientific exploration! Men and women of faith have certainly made their mistakes over the centuries, but haven't atheists made them too? Miscalculation and investigation are part and parcel for the advancement of science; the same can be said of religious belief. It seems that when man focuses exclusively on this mortal life he loses all perspective on the higher realms of thought and ideas, and casts religion aside as so much \\"nonsense\\" as Dawkins bluntly puts it. Atheists cannot even look at the sun for a full five minutes without suffering blindness, how can they begin to fully comprehend God? He has only hatred for Muslims, and spews vitriolic wrath on Christians who believe that the Bible is true. How sad that he spends so much of his book raving against people of faith, instead of expounding on his own scientific reasons for not believing in God and religion. <br /> <br />If you are an atheist, you will rejoice in this book-it confirms what you already \\"believe\\" to be true. <br /> <br />God bless Richard Dawkins for his honesty, it takes courage to fight a Force so much greater than oneself. Afterall, in the grand scheme of things, who is Richard Dawkins? There is nothing fresh or original about \\"The God Delusion.\\" Nietchze was a far better writer, and presented his atheistic beliefs in a more profound and thought-provoking way.
B000KJU1MS|1.0|Another chapter in the never ending saga of \\"How can Gene Simmons keep making money from the same fan base\\".  Someday either Harvard Business School will figure out this wacky but successful business model, or the Harvard Psychological Department will have a treatment for ignorance for us fans, better known as the KISS ARMY.  Since the current KISS line-up of Gene, Paul, Fake Kitty and Fake Spaceman is not making money, Gene has came up with this DVD to once again capitalize on the past.  Truth is, these same videos and concerts have been available from many other sources for almost 25 years.  I wonder if Kissology II will contain the ever famous interview with Tom Synder where a drunk Peter and Ace annoyed the ever so perfect Gene and Paul on TV.  Now that is a classic! (Note to Gene, although you looked like a fool during the TV interview on Tom Snyder, this would generate good revenue for the Gene Bank). <br /> <br />I am just anxiously awaiting the re-re-release of 'KISS meets the Phantom of the Park\\" remastered DVD.  Only this time they will actually use the real voices of Peter and Ace.  Also look for a reunion tour sometime in 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original reunion tour.

No...  <br /> <br />Found myself drawn in to the combination of loaded 'terms' (sanctuary, renewal, Sandmen [putting you to 'sleep']) + the sounds/'music' generated for the film by Mr Goldsmith - love the almost ethereal/otherworldly quality of the voice of the PA - e.g., <br />P.A.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|This is a really good action movie - lots of historical accuracy and a minimum of gore.  Primitive conditions, yes, but gory blood, not as much as you would think.  Also, the bonus features are fantastic.  There are two documentaries about the making of the film and the adaption of the novel that are fascinating and informative.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves period or adventure films.

B0001XAPZ6|2.0|I really did not like this movie, and I absolutely love this genre and this director's work.  What happened?  This movie was just toooooo weird.  Giant bug shells...?? Confusion as to what exactly the plot was...?? I had no idea what was going on and quite frankly I found that I didn't care.  I hate saying this, because I love this kind of movie  (Howl's Moving Castle lifted my spirit, I've seen it more times that I can count; The Cat Returns is beautiful; Spirited Away is awesome, etc...), but I really did NOT like this one.  I didn't care about the lead character, and felt I never got to know her at all.  She was dull and had no discernable heroic qualities.  I found none of the other characters even memorable.  The animation itself was gorgeous, however.<br /><br />I wish I could share in the apparant joy that everyone else here has for this one, I really do, but I have to be honest and quite frankly this movie was totally boring and made absolutely no sense.
0380789035|4.0|Fantasy and Horror readers have a non-formulaic writer with a limitless imagination.<br /><br />This book is fast paced and humorous as is all of Neil Gaiman's writing.  Much darker than The Annansi Boys, which also deals with gods.  American Gods introduces enough new and interesting characters to give this writer fodder for many years to come.<br /><br />I'll tell you what I tell my family and friends.  Buy this book.  Buy all of Neil Gaiman's books.  His work is a breath of fresh air.  Also watch for his many published short stories.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|The boxset is beautifully designed, richly decorated with images from the series. Probably the best looking boxset I've seen. <br /> <br />The series itself is scary, intelligent and emotionally rich. The entire series works on the relationship between the brothers, with the cases they investigate as more of a backstory. The main cast are outstanding with an excellent supporting cast, the stories are fun and interesting, and sometimes deliciously scary, and visually breathtaking. But the most addictive thing about the series is Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, who have wonderful chemistry and bring the vivid family story to life. This series is an absolute winner and I hope it's around for years to come.

0783225725|5.0|The motor that drives HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a metaphysical one.  A \\"Stranger\\" mysteriously appears in the dysfunctional desert town of Lago, kills three thugs who were hired by town fathers to protect the community from three vengeance-seeking outlaws soon to be released from prison, and subsequently intimidates, terrorizes, and humiliates everyone when the Stranger himself signs on to protect the town.<br /><br />All the while, we are privy to bits and pieces of an earlier death in Lago:  the death of a U.S. Marshal--brutally bullwhipped to death in the street--at the hands of the three imprisoned outlaws.  We learn the killers were set up by their employers--the Lago city fathers; and we learn why law-abiding citizens stood silently and looked the other way when their marshal was murdered.  With the outlaws released and on their way back to Lago to extract numerous pounds of flesh, the Stranger is revealed for who he really is:  a metaphysical Avenger who not only claims vengeance for the murder. . .but for the actions of those who were so callously duplicitous.<br /><br />While Clint Eastwood has more than his fair share of locker room humor in his portrayal of the Stranger, he succeeds in coming across as a terrifying and inhumane force.  When the Avenger finally confronts his killers, the effect is bloodchilling.  As mentioned before, the motor that drives HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a metaphysical one, and it's a motor that works perfectly for this Western.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING

Overall, if you are into old 70's - 80's horror movies, you will enjoy it.
055358202X|5.0|I've been reading this series and have been addicted to it from the beginning.  I must say that this is the worst of the books in this series so far.  With that said, I must add that the worst book in this series is still far better than most any other book I've ever read.  When you shine as brightly as a Song of Ice and Fire does, it's not such a bad thing to say that this is the worst book so far.  One of the three books that made up Lord of the Rings had to be the worst too, but it was still instant classic.  In my opinion Martin continues an incredibly strong series with another beautifully written volume that promises much for the remaining books yet to be published.  While this one doesn't have the level of action that the others have had, you do get to see a ton more character development and the book leaves you with a number of serious cliff-hangers that make you eagerly anticipate the next book.  This book is truly the worst of the best and I highly recommend them all.

B000HT3P7E|1.0|Okay, so my brother got me season one of \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" for Christmas, and swore it was the best comedy on TV.  I was willing to give it a shot; I'm somewhat of a Jason Segal fan from his Freaks and Geeks turn and we all know how funny Neil Patrick Harris can be (witness his scene stealing performance in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle).  So I had reason to expect an enjoyable program.    So what's the verdict?    When I was 17, I had an infected wisdom tooth pulled out and my mouth swelled and oozed pus for a week. I could only eat Gerber's baby food and fluids.  All in all, it was the most crappy experience ever.    Until I watched \\"How I Met Your Mother.\\"    If we lived in Ancient Rome, I was Emperor Commodos and I was watching this in the Colisseum...I would have given thumbs down to the whole proceeding with the hope that gladiators would come in wielding maces and destroy the bar and the apartment sets, where 99% of the show seems to take place.  However, had this show really existed way back then, the Roman Empire would have collapsed a lot sooner than it did.    Evidently, Some mad scientist pinpricked Jimmy Fallon's pinky, fertilized an egg with his DNA and out popped a fully-formed Josh Radnor, the lead actor of this show. Cloning Dolly the sheep was bad enough, but this is an affront to all ethics and morals, let alone good taste.  One small step for man, one giant leap BACKWARDS as far as comedy is concerned.    The uninspired, trite, and obvious comedy writing doesn't help, but it might have been surviveable had the characterizations been at all passable. But it is impossible for me to relate to these people. Self-absorbed narcissism was funny on Seinfeld because that was an irreverant and funny show, nobody was meant to like those characters.  But here, I would never want to be associated with these people in real life, let alone watch caricatures of them on TV.  It's Seinfeld without the humor.  And in case you were wondering, the humor was about 99.99999% of Seinfeld.  So what that means is that HIMYM is .00001% as funny.    Apparently, I am the lone dissenting opinion on this show, since every other Amazon reviewer raves about it.  I'm okay with that.  After all, Aristotle was ostracized for being the only person who thought the world was round. Not to say that I'm much like Aristotle--I don't wear togas.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great series. I am a fan of the show but missed many previous episodes. Would view this when I get the time.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I always liked Madonna but I never really became a huge fan. I have some of her albums but really the one that really got me was \\"CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR\\". I bought it right after I heard \\"HUNG UP\\" but I almost hesitated because I really found \\"AMERICAN LIFE\\" simple horrible. Anyway, I bought this combo for the DVD of her latest tour and I simply found it flawless. <br />The DVD perse isn't loaded with extra features but you don't care because the show is amazing. Madonna starts the show with a fusion of Donna Summer's \\"I FEEL LOVE\\" and \\"FUTURE LOVERS\\" appearing inside a huge crystal ball and continues the show with \\"GET TOGETHER\\" and goes on and on with a great selection of songs. Besides the poor speacial features on the DVD, some Madonna's classic songs are missing on the show such as \\"TAKE A BOW\\", \\"RAIN\\", \\"DON'T TELL ME\\" or \\"LIKE A PRAYER\\" she should've made a medley including her old hits. <br />What really impresses me is the perfection and clean performance of Madonna, she looks hotter than ever on this phase of her life, the choreography on the show is very good as the stage. One of the highlights of the show is when she appears on the famous cross and of course her voice is very good now. It's an incredible show, I don't get tired of repeating the same definition for the show. I really enjoy tracks like \\"JUMP\\", \\"CONFESSIONS\\", \\"LIKE A VIRGIN\\", one of my personal favorites \\"DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE\\" and \\"SORRY\\" <br />Another impressive thing about this combo, is the big impact on the charts. In the US it debuted on Billboard's Top 200 selling albums on #15 and had similar positions throughout the world. <br />Give it a try this is something that any music lover that doesn't dislike Madonna should have.
020161622X|2.0|I was planning to buy this book. But before buying, I checked it out on Google Books. This one is certainly not for the programmers but for the people who claim to be programmer. If you are a programmer, you don't do finger pointing when you or someone else discovers a bug in your program. You just get down to work with debugger. And in fact you learn a lot while debugging. So if you are a serious programmer (not just by some designation at your work), you don't need it.

0300108834|5.0|What a marvellous discovery this slim volume is.  We recommend it to all our friends.  The author covers most world events in depth.  His style is concise and well thought out.  I wish that I could meet him but he is no longer living.  Now I must explore his books of art.  In reading fine books, one begins a chain---which is what pleasurable reading is all about.

0812976525|5.0|I picked this up recently because I read and enjoyed excerpts of Florence of Arabia in Atlantic a while back (and still have it on my to-read list, which is ridiculously long).  I also had heard of the film, but didn't know it was based on a book or that Buckley wrote it. <br /> <br />What a well-crafted satire!  I smirked, snorted, giggled, and laughed my way through.  I appreciated the fine writing, even if it did get a little precious at times.   <br /> <br />The main character, Nick Naylor, spokesman for the euphemistically named Academy of Tobacco Sciences (otherwise known as the tobacco lobby) is a spinmeister of epic talent.  He seems more interested in the art of the spin than the actual views.  He almost always shakes off any qualms he has about debunking the dangers of tobacco.  He's sneaky and manipulative, and cynical.  And yet I liked him and his other lobbyist friends somehow.  And when things really start getting interesting, and it's not clear who Nick can trust, I actually found myself rooting for the guy. <br /> <br />But mostly I rooted for this hysterical sendup of the politics of public opinion.  I can't wait to see the movie, and I can't wait to read more from C Buckley!
0743454537|4.0|and think<br /><br />This is the story of Andromeda - called Anna. She was bred for a specific purpose: to save her sister, Kate.<br /><br />It is the story of her family: dad Brian, the firefighter and amateur astronomer who is the glue of the family; brother Jesse who is a rebel without a cause; sister Kate, dying of one thing and another; mother Sara, the force of the family.<br /><br />It is the story of Campbell, the lawyer Anna hires to medically emancipate herself. He also has a little mysterious side-story in that he has a work dog (like a seeing eye dog) but won't tell anyone why he has the dog. He just makes up reasons (my favorite was \\"I'm a lawyer, he chases ambulances for me!\\") and it's the story of Julia, an external voice who is assigned by the judge to weigh the merits of Anna's request. Julia and Campbell have a back story, too.<br /><br />The number of plots are as complicated as the subtext of the main plot: is it morally right to birth a child simply to save another child? And should that second child have the right to deny treatment?<br /><br />I did enjoy this story, it was engagingly written. The fonts changed as the story teller changed and it all worked together very well. It has a nice long epilogue to tell you what happens after it all settles. And, of course, there's enough in here to make any mother cry and cringe in the night.<br /><br />That to me is why it loses a star. I'm a whimp. I don't like to read about stuff like this. Had I known the subject material, I would never have read it. But it was given to me to read by a friend; so read I did. I'm going to have nightmares tonight.<br /><br />(*)>
B00005JLR8|4.0|All the actors and actresses carried this movie and made it so believable.  You could sense the exhilaration, frustration, danger and opportunities in \\"coming to America\\".  The melting pot, indeed.  The Bolger sisters absolutely were the touch of grace in this story....the phrase \\"Goodbye Frankie....say 'goodbye Frankie' Dad...\\" will indelibly be etched in my mind.  Tough, heartbreakingly real and giving a glimpse of the aspirations of millions who've come ashore.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Sometimes these collaborations between famous rockers and old bluesmen don't turn out so well. Some do, such as Jimmy Rodgers' Blues Blues Blues, and Hubert Sumlin's About Them Shoes. In any case, the famous rockers too often take center stage. Kenny Wayne Shepherd takes a different approach on the brilliant 10 Days Out. Shepherd, his bandmates, and the Double Trouble rhythm section are the supporting cast to the real stars of this CD and DVD, weathered bluesmen (and blueswoman!) both well-known and obscure. From acoustic backwoods jams to live electric performances, this has it all. And even better, Shepherd took the audio and video crew to the hometowns of the blues musicians and jammed in kitchens, the backwoods, living rooms.... wherever the magic appeared. Even B.B. King performs in a juke joint in his hometown of Indianola MS. If you love the blues, you must own this CD!<br /><br />POSTCRIPT: The DVD is absolutely a gem! Professionally produced and worthy of broadcast, the blues musicians talk about their lives and and the blues. And like the music, Shepherd stays in the backgroud. The DVD is not about Kenny On The Road, it's about the blues and the musicians who create the music. It's interesting that this package is marketed as an audio CD with a bonus DVD. It could have easily been packaged as a DVD with a bonus CD - it's that good!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Imagine a family having dinner. The husband talks about a \\"Nine Steps To Success\\" plan he has made into a book, which he plans to sell to the world and make millions. He is obsessed with success because he's had very little success of his own. A little girl watches a beauty pageant with intensity you rarely see in a child, as she dreams of a future that will never come. A teenage boy who appears to hate EVERYONE has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his dream goal of becoming a test pilot! A grandpa eats chicken and snorts cocain, catching up on all the stupid mistakes he wished he had made as a kid. A uncle who attempted suicide failed in his attempt to kill himself, and now must learn to pick up the pieces in his life again. Then we have a mom who loves her family dearly, but finds herself about to explode trying to keep it together.<br /><br />This is the Hoover family, a family that is dysfunctional, all have dreams, and don't quite know what to do with themselves. They are all stuck in their daily routine, letting their problems and worries pile up until there is almost nowhere left to pile them. Then one day the daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin, who fully deserves her Best Supporting Actress nomination), gets a call from the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Due to a previous contender dropping out of the competition due to diet pills (they grow up so fast these days) Olive is now entered into the competition. With no money to get to the pageant by plane though the dad, Richard (Greg Kinnear), packs up the family for a road trip to California in order to get Olive to Little Miss Sunshine. No one in the family (save for Olive) is happy about this trip.<br /><br />Neither Grandpa (Alan Arkin) or son Dwayne (Paul Dano) want to go on the trip, but due to Uncle Frank's (Steve Carell) suicide attempt has to come along (because it would be irresponsible to leave these two alone in the house to watch Uncle Frank). With dear old mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) the only one who could possibly keep this family from killing each other, she too is along for the road trip. Things don't always go as smoothly as they should though. In what becomes one of the best running gags in the movie, the stick shift of their mini-bus breaks, so they have to constantly push the mini-bus until they can get it into the third gear. Grandpa gives Dwayne advice my grandpa would have never given me, as when he justifies his cocain addition by saying \\"When you're young you'd be dumb to snort cocain. When you're old you'd be dumb not to.\\"<br /><br />These people have issues, but it doesn't matter. Really, it doesn't. This is not a movie about dysfunctional people who overcome their quirks to become \\"normal.\\" No, this is a movie about people who are dysfunctional and come to terms with the fact that they, and everyone else around them, are dysfunctional too. The point is that they all love each other. Overcoming personal quirks is a battle you're destined to fail, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron. But quirks can be embraced and become redeeming features about you. One of these quirks is the way Frank runs. Truth be told, it's a silly looking run, one that you would easily mock if you saw it on the street. Once you see it a few times though, you realize that the run is a result of his attempts to get his life back on track, one foot after the other. It's just one of many examples of the excellent acting and character development found in the film.<br /><br />Of course, the reason all this works above all else is because the movie is funny. Looking back at what I wrote, I realize I must have made this movie sound like a drama. Well, there are some dramatic moments, but this is a comedy through and through. In lesser movies about road trips (I'm looking at you \\"RV\\") the characters would get themselves into situations that wanted to be funny but weren't. Most of the time these situations involve main characters getting covered in fecal matter,family deputes over little things like how they look, and the road trip itself would be the cover up for a big meeting dad has to go to.<br /><br />In this movie no one gets covered in unmentionables, the conversations about beauty are talked about frankly instead of stupidly, and the road trip really is about the pageant itself. If there is a flaw to the movie it's the beauty pageant itself. We have so much fun on the road, that when we get to the pageant itself it's kind of weird and creepy. Seeing all these seven year old kids walking around with makeup on and dressing in [...]dresses is certainly accurate, but disturbing none-the-less. When the movie ends there is sense of wanting to continue with the family to see where their life goes, but also a sense that they've come to grips with who they are, and though they will still be dysfunctional when they get home, they will also live better lives as a result of this trip. Once again the old saying that the destination is not as important as the journey itself proves true once again.<br /><br />Rating: **** starsngs like how they look, and the road trip itself would be the cover up for a big meeting dad has to go to.

B0000009S3|5.0|Guitarists can jam to the jazz/rock leanings of this massive recording - but Willi the Pimp is my favorite.<br /><br />I long avoided Zappa due to a couple of distasteful episodes, with less than savory Zappa fans who seemed more amused with his sophomoric jokes than his musical prowess, and well, I don't know what Zappa would have expected. He reportedly disowned those fans who were simply buying his records to hear him talk about eating yellow snow, or lament that it hurts when he pees.<br /><br />NONE of that nonsense here.<br /><br />Back in the day I stayed up late to see Zappa on Letterman - and when Zappa was mentioning that some of his earliest records were getting rereleased he rattled off a couple of titles. Letterman snickered at the amusing names (Freak Out, and such) and Zappa shot him a look that I thought was pointlessly over-reactive.<br /><br />Maybe the 80's Zappa was taking himself too seriously, but it seems hard to imagine.<br /><br />His long time friend and sometimes antagonist Don Van Vliet is here as Captain Beefheart giving a terrific (though story-filled) performance - and honestly it's such a great \\"beefheart\\" tune that it's worth the price of the record just for that bit for Beefheart fans.<br /><br />Zappa puts guitar playing first here, and it's worth it. The man obviously loved good guitar music, and there's shades here of everything from Sharrock to McLaughlin. While mainly a fusion Jazz record, some of the meandering solos are so satisfying that it's easy to forget that this was one of rock's \\"weirdos\\" (or freaks, which Van Vliet HATED).<br /><br />enjoy
B00005JPAM|4.0|Biopics are a dime a dozen, and the ability to make a successful biopic depends largely on who you're making the biopic of, who it's fanbase of the loved public figure is, and whether or not you want to please that fanbase or tick them off. \\"The Queen\\" chooses the middle road in this final decision, which was a risky move on the film makers part, but one that pays off nicely. \\"The Queen\\" is a fictional story of the events that take place after Princess Diana's untimely death. After a series of news clips that show Diana behaving questionably, we then cut to a servant waking up Prince Philip and letting him know that Diana has been killed in a car crash. The newly appointed prime minister Tony Blair is quick to make a statement about Diana's death, uttering his famous quote \\"she was the people's princess.\\"<br /><br />After his statement, Blair goes to the royals and asks if they would like to say anything publicly about Diana's death. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren, in a role that is sure to win her a Best Actress award come Oscar time) refuses, stating \\"no member of the royale family will comment on the Princesses death.\\" The royals no longer consider Diana part of the royal family, remembering her as a woman who partied too much, had public affairs, and was an overall headache. Besides, the death of a family member is a \\"personal family affair, and the public will understand that.\\" Too bad for the Queen, but the public doesn't respond well to the silence at all. They eagerly await a public acknowledgment from their queen, and are furious at the silence of the royals. When the royals refuse to hang their flag down to acknowledge the loss of a loved one, tempers flair even more.<br /><br />The media prints news article after news article, condemning the royals for their silence, while the Prince just mumbles about how rude the people are being. \\"They talk as if they were the one's who knew her,\\" he says angrily. \\"To them she was a saint, to us she was a nuisance.\\" Blair has a public relations nightmare as he tries to calm Britains anger, but finds himself in popular light where everyone is in favor of destroying the monarchy in favor of a new government (preferably with Blair in it). The royals themselves don't come off as cruel, selfish people, but rather as people who are controlled by tradition and time. The world has evolved greatly since Queen Elizabeth II began her ruling, where she once was the Queen, but now is the Queen in name only. She does not interact with people outside of the castle and royal grounds, and simply cannot relate to the peoples outrage.<br /><br />As the week goes on, we feel sad for her when she loses sleep at night, feeling hurt and rejected by her people. She can't even begin to figure out why they hate her so much. Is it too much to ask for some privacy when mourning the loss of a family member? Was Diana still considered a family member when the royal family rejected her a few years ago? If she is not, then why is it her responsibility to make a statement? When she discovers that Diana's funeral will be attended by celebrities, she wonders whether or not people will be watching Diana's funeral as if it were the circus. Compared to Prince Philips, who openly shows a lot of resentment towards Diana, Queen Elizabeth II truly comes off as someone who cares about the situation, but just doesn't know what to do about it. Even Prince Charles urges her to make a statement, though he certainly doesn't completely understand what his mother is going thru.<br /><br />When Queen Elizabeth II finally does exit the castle to be with her people while they mourn, she is shocked and touched by how much love and emotion she feels from her people. Her eyes swell up with tears, as if she was feeling what it was like to be a true queen again for the first time in years. There was a whole world she was missing full of love and compassion, and it was waiting for her if she would just go outside once in awhile. Even Tony Blair, who receives the full blow of the ripple effect caused by the royals silence, begins to understand where the Queen is coming from. When his wife encourages Blair to just let the Queen \\"hang herself,\\" Blair frowns at her and says \\"You don't understand, this is six hundred years of tradition she's throwing away.\\"<br /><br />Yes the royals made a mistake, but maybe it wasn't a mistake. Maybe it was a miscalculation. The royals certainly couldn't have predicted what silence would mean to Britain, and they were unprepared for the backlash they received. Maybe they just didn't understand the situation in the first place? Maybe we didn't take the time to understand their feelings, or wonder what their situation was? Maybe it was a combination of all the above? Regardless what the situation was, it was all worth it for a little bit more understanding of each other. For in the midst of confusion, hope shined through.<br /><br />Rating: **** starsony Blair, who receives the full blow of the ripple effect caused by the royals silence, begins to understand where the Queen is coming from.

080701429X|5.0|This book was read many years ago at a time when this reviewer felt nearly crushed under the weight of family and personal troubles.  It is not light and diverting reading; indeed, in part it is terrifying.  Yet the memory of it has persisted across all these years.<br /><br />A prominent psychiatrist in pre-World War II Vienna, Doctor Frankl found himself suddenly stripped of all money, possessions, position, respect, and ultimately, his family--including his pregnant and beloved wife.  After confinement in some of the smaller concentration camps, he ultimately arrived at Auschwitz--the lowest circle of the man-made Hell that was the system of concentration and extermination camps (in German, 'Konzentrationslager' and 'Vernichtungslager').  There, his medical skills were not employed until nearly the end of the war.  Instead, he was employed at hard labor just like the rest of the men in his prison block who were marched every day to their work site before dawn and marched back late at night.<br /><br />The most striking thing about Frankl's account of his imprisonment (to me at least) was not the backbreaking work, the all-pervading fear, nor even the constant, maddening hunger; but the unrelenting degradation of the prisoners in order to get them to accept the Nazi's judgment of them as sub-human.  For example, when carrying heavy tanks filled with human sewage for disposal, almost inevitably some would splash prisoners full in the face.  Any move to wipe one's face, or even show instinctive grimaces of disgust would be punished by the Capos (trusted prisoners, chosen mostly for their brutality) with a prompt beating from a club or whip.  Because of this, the normal reactions of prisoners to being befouled were soon suppressed.  Every attempt possible was made to degrade the prisoners by the (frequently delighted) SS guards and the Capos.  Subjected to this treatment, some prisoners gave up hope and committed suicide by running into the inner electric fence that encircled the camp. Others would lie motionless in their bunks in their own waste--ignoring pleas to get up from fellow prisoners, and blows from guards alike--smoking up all of the cigarettes they might have been saving for barter.<br /><br />Faced with this, Frankl combated this potential demoralization in himself and others by leading the prisoners back to their own humanity.  \\"Every freedom may be taken away from a man but one; the freedom to choose what attitude he will take towards his conditions.\\"  Despite every attempt to rob them of human dignity, prisoners still had a choice.  Would they take an attitude of 'I die tomorrow; you die today' and behave as starving beasts--stealing other prisoner's food, for example; or would they show that they were neither animals nor things, but human beings?  Some Amazon reviews of an earlier edition of this book seemed to imply that Frankl had judged those who despaired and died to be weak, or that he was somehow 'better' than they for having survived.  Those reviewers can only have done this by forgetting what they had read.  Frankl instead writes with sorrow that \\"the best of us did not survive\\", warmly remembering comrades who ended their days offering comfort and sometimes their last bit of bread to fellow prisoners.<br /><br />We live in an age when the feeling that one's life is meaningless is rampant even compared to the recent past.  Many compensate by drowning themselves in their career; working fourteen hour days, always gabbing into their cell phone, and carrying their laptop everywhere so they can do some work even in what would be an idle moment.  Others escape into escapist and/or authoritarian religion, gladly handing over the miserable burden of their freedom and the need to find meaning to someone else.  (Frankl--an observant Jew throughout his life--was not anti-religious I should point out.  He writes that a therapist's attempts to debunk genuine religious or spiritual views are an unethical attempt toforce the therapist's views on a client.)  Still others use alcohol and/or drugs (including perfectly legal drugs)as a response to a sense of life's meaninglessness or futility.<br /><br />Frankl writes that our struggle--even our despair--over finding meaning in our lives is not an psychiatric illness, or even a precursor to one.  Potential readers of this book will not find \\"The Meaning of Life\\".  What they will find is the story of a man who was compelled to develop the tools to find his own meaning, his 'why'--at a time when his life depended on it in a way seldom seen in life and history.  Hopefully, these tools will benefit others as they have benefited me.  As someone wrote of Ralph Waldo Emerson, \\"He did not try to lead others to himself, but to themselves.\\"client.)

0099478935|4.0|This is a great book, a must read to balance the voice of the UN Sceptics out there. The UN Peacekeeping Missions are not all incompetent, the system is. Who is the system? It's the Security Council with their various Committees. When things go right, the Security Council gets the praises, when things go wrong, people like Roméo Dallaire gets the blames.  <br /> <br />There are many things UN Sceptics out there do not know but love to criticize i.e. the UN does not have its own troops, the UN Peacekeeping Mission's Military and Civilian Personnel rarely has control of the strategic operations or budget of a mission; it is the UN Security Council who does. Another very important must know-point, before criticizing the quality of the troops in a UN Mission; please please first ask the question \\"Where are the troops from those `high quality' countries?\\" When you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. When there's no political will to stop bad things from happening, the Rwandan genocide is what you get.  <br /> <br />Roméo Dallaire wrote from first hand experience, for those who could not write out because of contractual obligation. Dallaire's account was a good picture of betrayal, naïveté, and international politics we all experience.  <br /> <br />While Roméo Dallaire wrote briefly about the Mission 's Chief Administrative Officer who seemed indifferent to Dallaire's request for urgent requirement, he failed to understand another UN internal political undercurrent, nobody will stick their neck out, not then, not now .. because they get chopped.  <br /> <br />Someone wrote that book has too many acronyms, people and jargons, too much frustrations .. well folks, welcome to the UN world.

0393325172|5.0|C. S. Forester, Beat to Quarters.<br /><br />Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander<br /><br />I've begun reading C. S. Forester's  Horatio Hornblower novels for the fourth or fifth time and I'm enjoying them almost as much as the first time through. Last year, I read about half of Patrick O'Brian's stunning Aubrey-Maturin sea novels for a second time: they didn't lose a thing in the rereading, they're so good. Both authors knew their subject matter thoroughly -naval battle in the age of sail, the sea campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Both succeeded admirably in conveying the nature and feel of life at sea in crowded, sometimes ungainly, often elegant wooden sailing vessels that in the heat of battle often became floating coffins for the men who inhabited them. Self-doubting Hornblower and his loyal lieutenant Bush, ebullient Jack Aubrey and his surgeon-spy friend Stephen Maturin are men we easily come to admire, full-fleshed characters. The love stories which form a second melody in many of the books in both series are engrossing; you root for the course of true love, for Hornblower's indomitable Lady Barbara and Jack's virginal and stubbornly maternal Sophie.<br /><br />There are differences. O'Brian is the more consistently superior writer and you laugh more when you read his books. Forester has the annoying habit of telling the reader about changes (largely naval practices) that occur later than the events described rather than, as does O'Brian, simply letting the details of the narration build up a sense of past times in the reader's mind. But Foresterr doesn't indulge himself often and it's a very minor irritation in a splendid narrative that spreads across how eleven novels.<br /><br />The ambition of these writers is abashing. How did they keep narrative focus through eleven (in Forester's case) and eighteen (O'Brian's) books? How did they succeed -and succeed they truly did--in creating real characters who mature from book to book and communicate their humanity as well as their heroism to readers of a time two hundred years later? These are exceptional books.as well as their heroism to readers of a time two hundred years later? These are exceptional books.
B000GDH9J6|4.0|'Mountain Patrol:  Kekexili,' may make you feel noble going into the film, but it will leave you feeling exhiliarated.  Featuring particularly gorgeous landscape in the mountains bordering China and Tibet, the whole venue made me envy theater goers or HD and widescreen TV owners.  Greed and need is the theme as the same-titled voluntary border patrol is vigilant against poachers killing and hording rare, endangered Tibetan antelope.  The movie shows how even the Third World can have people hording natural resources--imagine that!  Here even the women are casualties as every step the men take away from home to work is toward a warzone.  With a tight drama and authentic scenes, the whole presentation comes across like an indulgent popcorn* flick with a message.  Whether you root for protecting the antelope or the people who are casualties on both sides of the war (more like me), 'Mountain Patrol:...' will at least have everyone cheering for the movie.    (*Clarification:  \\"Popcorn flick\\" at the time meant entertainment to me.  Here it is an adventure, but I've come to understand that \\"popcorn\\" means more well rounded entertainment.  Don't expect 'Raiders of the Lost Arc' or the 'Pirates...' series.)
B000301YY8|5.0|I'd heard the breakthrough \\"You're Beautiful\\" thousands of times, and I was thinking to myself the other day, \\"I love this song, why haven't I bought the album?\\", so I did.  Brilliant.  Blunt is a singer songwriter who doesn't have to break any musical boundaries to instantly be likable.  He's a bit folk, a bit pop, and a bit rock, and these combinations are incredible in the way that he mixes them on Back to Bedlam.  Plus his lyrics seem genuine and his voice is very unique.  Standout tracks would be the aforementioned \\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", \\"Tears and Rain\\", \\"No Bravery\\", and my favorite, \\"Wisemen\\".  Get this album if you like cool music, and when he makes his next one, buy that too. <br />
1932100660|1.0|This book is biased. Bad conclusion drawn from a misrepresented epidemiological study.<br /><br />I posted a lengthy review here that was somehow removed.<br /><br />I will just stress again that this book will NOT make anyone cancer-proof and though some of the recommendations will improve health (natural foods, etc) in the short run, the overall thrust will degrade health in the long term.<br /><br />Think about it, indigenous peoples up to a 100 years ago were not primarily vegetarians and they were very robust and did not suffer from our modern degenerative diseases. One does not even need an epidemiological study to clearly see the manifest truth in this simple observation.<br /><br />Google comments from \\"Winfield Abbe\\" on the Net and you will get an idea of what REAL science has to say on the matter. The truth is out there and it tends to be cheap/free. We all have a choice...continue in the shell game or abandon convention, take personal responsibility and claim our right to a healthy life.
0767827716|5.0|This movie is still one of my favorites.  I watch it whenever it is on the television.  Now that I have my own DVD of Christine, I watch it whenever I feel like it.  Great movie.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I loved this movie! Perfectly cast, great adaption to the comic book with many scenes visually right out of the classic comic pages. It took a while to get used to the Green Goblin's new look, but no movie is perfect....Defoe \\"played\\" the part perfectly!....but I guess a guy in purple hot pants and an elf hat would look kinda ridiculous in a live action movie!..hhhmmm? This is a popcorn movie all the way and Spider-man 2 was even better....not by much. I really like the first one. I can't wait for Spider-man 3! The 2 disc DVD set has a great transfer and a ton of extras! If you like the movie...BUY IT!
B00004D0EP|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  I have enjoyed watching it over and again.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|I admit I have not been a My Chemical Romance fan since the beginning, but they have definetely grown on me since I first heard them. This cd overpowers the previous ones with songs that help through the toughest times like Cancer, or songs that you just want to get up and dance to like The Sharpest Lives. Even the 72 page booklet was hard to put down, with the making of the cd, their traumatic events at The Paramour, and how each song came about in the making. This is definetely a must have for any My Chemical Romance fan.
B000J103YI|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to have the soundtrack.  It is great.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|<br />Put together Miles Davis' \\"Bitches Brew\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"II\\" and \\"III\\", and King Crimson's \\"In The Court of King Crimson\\", and you get \\"Frances The Mute\\". My favorite Mars Volta album so far, but all of them are amazing. Could be very very strange for listeners who never listened to this kind of music. To me, this album resembles \\"Bitchs Brew\\" alot (not just in the music itself, but the way it was received by the public - you either hate it or love it).
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I love her CD.  I play it over and over again.  Her style is unique and her music is soothing.
0887081770|5.0|My daughter LOVES the moon and when I gave her this book she absolutely LOVED it!  She asks me to read it multiple times every night!  It is a very cute and charming story--another great book by Eric Carle!!!  I think I will get this book as a gift for my friends who are expecting!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So I finally saw Serenity.  And of course, I couldn't get enough.  I immediately purchased it, along with Firefly and the Firefly soundtrack (on iTunes).  After that, of course, I had to go out and find the R. Tam Sessions.  Not a bit of it disappointed.  Since finishing the pilot episode of Firefly, I have been unable to stop myself from referencing it on a daily basis (as the title of the review may point out to an astute flan).  To sum up a vast amount of emotion that I could pour into this show, I will only say that I am both astounded that I wasn't exposed to this earlier, and glad that I have now found it.  I am proud to call myself a flan and a browncoat.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I have seen this movie (which I now own on DVD) 4 times with 6 different people from the ages of 18 months to 88 years, and everyone has loved it. I highly recommend it for all ages!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When it was revealed that there was going to be a Rocky VI, many naysayers groaned and complained that enough was enough and that Sly was too over the hill and couldn't pull it off.  But the TRUE FANS out there knew differently.  Even the critics, who initially made skeptical/negative comments about the sixth installment, started turning their stories around after viewing the film in its entirety.  Rocky Balboa is a real winner of a movie, that fully realizes the essence of the original classic and brings the saga full circle to a thrilling, emotional, and very memorable conclusion.        Many years have gone by since last we saw Rocky, who is now a widower, estranged from his son and still mourning the loss of his beloved wife, Adrian.  There are some truly touching moments of Rocky at the cemetery, sitting by her grave (when I saw the film in theaters, no one in the audience made a sound - even the rowdy ones - during these scenes, out of pure respect for the characters) as well as Rocky's journey, with Paulie, to all the places he took Adrian on their classic first date.  So touching.        Now Rocky has his own restaurant, where he greets his customers and regales them with past stories of glory.  But deep inside of him is a rage that he must get out of himself and conquer in order to move on with his life.  The only way to do that is to go back in the ring.  But when a computer simulated match between Rocky and the current reigning heavyweight champion of the world, Mason Dixon, is shown on TV, showing Rocky as the victor, word spreads like wildfire for the real thing.        No Rocky film is complete without a training montage, and this film's got it in spades.  Stallone has the character of Rocky so integrated within himself, and gives nothing short of one of his finest performances on screen.  Many memorable scenes, including Rocky's long and emotional talk with his son, as well as his new relationship with Marie (the young woman Rocky walked home back inthe first installment) make for truly compelling drama.  And the climactic fight at the finale is the icing on the cake.  It's inspirational and never disappoints for a second.        Rocky Balboa belongs in the collection of every fan (and non-fan alike for that matter) and the DVD is loaded with wonderful bonus features, including Audio Commentary with Stallone, Deleted Scenes, Featurettes, Alternate Ending, and more.  Pick this film up and watch it again and again.  You'll be happy you did.        Rocky Balboa - a fitting end to the Rocky Saga!      \\"But it ain't about how hard you hit.  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.\\" - Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa
B00006DEFA|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I was a kid. But I had never seen the director's cut and didn't even know it existed. This movie came out before I was even born but this version definitely does it justice.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Wolfmother is an Australian power trio which has an obvious love for the rock of the seventies, and have taken that angle and gone full-bore with it, producing a very retro and occasionally psychedelic solid rock album that would have been huge in 1974.<br /><br />The musical touchstones on display here are many, but the influence of bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Blue Cheer seem to be the most overt influences, along with occasional Pink Floyd, Doors and Hendrix reference. Taking a page from the White Stripes, Wolfmother have taken the idea of \\"vintage\\" music as a modern concept of style and created a cover band that plays no covers. Old-school seventies-style rock without the sardonic posturing and Spinal Tap-eque bad taste of, say, The Darkness, these guys seem to play this style because they love it. This has been done before, but never quite so successfully...these guys definately rock.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|This is a classic film by one of the greatest directors of our time. Talk about fast-paced and unpredictable! This movie and its fantastic cast should all be up for Oscars. <br /> <br />Just bought the DVD. Can't wait to watch it again and again on my HD 65-inch TV.
0375831002|5.0|What can I say that other reviewers haven't already said? <br />I was drawn to The Book Thief by the fact that Death was its reader. This, I felt was a highly original idea and if done well, would make for interesting reading. I was not disappointed, though interesting hardly does the book justice. Markus Zusak has a skill for stretching the english language to its limits, and for getting as much out of it as possible, and nowhere is this better applied than through death's voice.  <br />The style of the book takes some getting used to, but it captures the reader's attention straight off.  <br />The characters are well drawn and easy to identify with.  <br />What makes this book different is that it is set during world war two in Nazi Germany itself, from the point of view of ordinary german civilians, who, the reader swiftly comes to realise, were really no different than any other civilians caught up in a war.  <br />The book is a wonderful mixture of the humorous and the deeply poigniant. It would be impossible to list every moment that brought a lump to my throat but for me, the scene where Leasle is reading aloud to all those gathered with her in the bomb shelter, and the way the words allow them all to forget their problems for a while is one of the most moving things I've ever read.  <br />This is a book difficult to forget, and one which I suspect will be read many more times.
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell's book is a nice collection of interesting stories.  It is an easy read and generally entertaining.  However, beyond that, it does not hold up to the other reviews in my opinion.  In one instance, he insinuates that we should trust our first instincts yet points out many cases where are first inclinations are not correct.    If you are looking for a book to teach you how to hone your intuition and first instincts, this is not it.  Beyond the storytelling, there is not much in terms of deep analysis to help an individual learn to utilize their instinctive abilities.  Nice stories but little else in my opinion.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|I really liked Saw I. Saw II was about half as good as Saw I. But, I couldn't get thru 30 minutes of Saw III. It has no story to it. It just goes from one human torture to the next human torture, & so on. This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.
B000LE0THO|5.0|First the negatives, as there are only two. 1: there are no song lyrics as there was with original lp. 2: To pull the cd out of its envelope is quite a challange, use extreme caution when removing the cd, as it is extremely tight, as you would not want to damage the cd in anyway. My advice would be to burn a copy and use it for listening, keep the original \\"Out Of The Blue\\" cd in stock. All that aside, the rest of this review is all positve. Beautiful package by Sony, the 24 page booklet is extremely informative, the pop out space ship is a nice retro 1970s treat. Elos most commercial album release is not as experimental as their earlier releases but is definintly a synth masterpiece that leaves experimenting far behind. As I listen to \\"Out Of The Blue\\" I hear how Jeff Lynne and Elo have matured at this stage of their careers, the result is a mind blowing recording masterpiece. Commercial as this album was, Elo broke the mold with \\"Out Of The Blue\\" as they never appraoched this level of creativity and popularity ever again, despite many excellent recordings after \\"Out Of The Blue\\". \\"Out Of The Blue\\" catches Jeff Lynne and Elo at their creative zenith. This original lp recording was done with care and precision during its production in 1977. Every song is treated with that Jeff Lynne touch, that every song on an lp should be treated like a single, as every song is a story and not just filler on an lp. \\"Out Of The Blue\\" is in my opinion a landmark rock recording. A true synth masterpiece. \\"Out Of The Blue\\" speaks volumes of pop, rock, disco, fusion, jazz, blues and classical. \\"Out Of The Blue\\" is a true Elo magnum opus. What more can I say? you ask, the remastering is incredible and life like as every instrument is heard in its own seperate space. Especially the synthesizers on \\"The Whale\\" the sound is life like. I swear at times listening to this cd, an Elo chorus was inside my speakers. Harmoniously the remastering really stands out as you hear the Elo voices freshand new like you did during \\"Out Of The Blues\\" release in 1977. I waited along time for \\"Out Of The Blue\\" to be remastered, as I own all the Epic Legacy Elo remasters. There are also 3 bonus tracks 18.\\"Wild West Hero\\" - (alternate bridge mix, previously unreleased, bonus track)19. \\"Quick And The Draft\\", The (previously unreleased, Bonus  20.\\"Latitude 88 North\\" - (previously unreleased, Bonus). I admit the wait was worth it. This newly remastered 30th anniversary limited \\"Out Of The Blue\\" edition is a well thought out cd package release that transports me back to 1977-1978. A must own for any fan of music. Special praise for Jeff Lynne for an incredible supervised remastered edition of \\"Out Of The Blue\\". Its 1977-1978 all over again, only this time it isn't with a double lp set................
B000F3T3CS|5.0|In my opinion this will become a classic in the same way the Lisbon Traviata or the Milanov Gioconda became classics. <br />Netrebko and Villazon are pure magic together. <br />Don't miss this one.
B000JCETDS|4.0|I loved it!  Once you get past the overused F word its AWESOME!  Mr. Black is hilarious AND talented with his use and abuse of music.  Once you get past the language thing...the music really rocks AND makes you laugh at the same time...I'm still not sure how bigfoot fits in...but the line: \\"Your gonna gargle man-aze...ewugh!\\" still cracks me up!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|A Matter of Life and Death is, quite simply, the best album Iron Maiden has released since 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. There are a few albums that come close to matching Seventh Son since its release (the last 2 releases and The X Factor (Yeah, the X Factor)are good examples) but it isn't more definite than this album. Every track is a highlight. There are a load of powerful epics on this album. In fact, there are only 4 that can't be fully considered epics: Different World, These Colours Don't Run, The Pilgrim, and Out of the Shadows, which are all great songs. The 2 most epic tracks on the album are For the Greater Good of God and The Legacy. But, as I said, every track is a solid highlight. I cannot fully describe my satisfaction with this disc. <br /> <br />Metal is once again rising. This album debuted in the US Top 200 at #9, a feat Iron Maiden had never accomplished (not even in their reign of the 80's). Just remember, Iron Maiden dominated in the 80's, and I believe this album once again puts them on top of the metal world. Check these guys out if you haven't. Iron Maiden is the greatest heavy metal act to ever walk the earth (not Metallica, not Judas Priest, not anyone).  <br /> <br />Buy this album. You won't be sorry. <br /> <br />Up the Irons! <br /> <br />
B000IOM0YM|5.0|A true documentary of the begining- with clips and appearences you may have seen as a kid...there all here! Great- including the coverage of Cadilac High was cool- I had seen photos-but this was the filmed footage of the event! Very cool.  For the true Kiss Fan a must have....but they know that.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I love this CD.  She has a unique voice and catchy tunes.

0385508417|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  A very quick, silly read.  Very funny and perfect to read during the hustle and bustle of the holiday season.
0800141660|5.0|If you like true romance with honor and love and commitment, you will love this one.  Alan Rickman, who makes an excellent \\"bad guy\\" in so many movies, plays a gentle soul in love with a real firebrand of a young woman.  Hugh Grant plays his usual stumbling, mumbling role to its wonderful completion.  Emma Thomson is awesome, as is Kate Winslet.  This one is a keeper!
0807126063|3.0|I enjoyed this book and am glad that I read it BUT it was a 3 star book for me for one reason.  When it is funny, it is REALLY funny.  When it is not funny it is REALLY boring.  Still worth the time for the laughs but not a masterpiece in my opinion.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This is Norah's best CD.  Choice of songs is brilliant.  Jones has created her own style and parrots no one.  She is a very independent spirit who is also accepted commercially.   Bravo Norah! <br /> <br /> <br />

B000ICL3KG|5.0|THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST-MADE SCIENCE DOCUMENTARY I HAVE SEEN, WITH ENOURMOUS AMOUNTS OF SCIENTIFIC DATA, EVIDENCES AND CLEAR VISUAL PRESENTATIONS. <br /> <br />I THINK THIS DVD IS ONE SCIENCE LECTURE ON GLOBAL WARMING THAT NO ONE SHOULD MISS.  IN FACT, I THINK IT SHOULD BE SHOWN IN EVERY SECONDARY (HIGH) SCHOOL AS PART OF THE SCIENCE SUBJECTS. <br /> <br />IN THE MOVIE, THERE ARE FOOTAGES OF COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF A RISE IN SEA LEVEL OF 20 FT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN CITIES. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO DO FURTHER SIMULATIONS ON LOW-LYING COUNTRIES SUCH AS SINGAPORE, THE MALDIVES, INDONESIA, PHILLIPINES, AND ALSO KEY WATERFRONT CITIES LIKE SYDNEY, PERTH, HONGKONG, ETC. ARE THERE OTHER DOCUMENTARY MOVIES OF SUCH SIMULATIONS? <br /> <br />I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SOURCE MORE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF THE COLLAPSING ICE SHELVES, AND THE DWINDLING GLASIERS. <br /> <br />WONGCK
067960085X|3.0|This is a difficult book for me to sum up.  It had GREAT characters and the story was interesting too, but was also a bit slow in places and confusing at times.  After seeing the movie, I can understand why Mr. Capote disliked it so much, it was NOTHING like the book.  Two totally different endings.  Overall, a good, quick read but for me NOT a must read.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Best DVD concert than I never seen, the audio is great with DTS 5.1  <br />The Confessions tour is amazing.
0142004235|4.0|Another Steinbeck classic!  I have never been disappointed with a Steinbeck novel and this was no exception.  Beautifully written and just flows so easily.  It is quite lengthy and VERY descriptive but it wouldn't be true Steinbeck if it were not.  Well worth the time for me.
B000A6T262|5.0|If you're any type of Trek fan, then you should get a copy of this set. All 10 movies (so far...) comes in a two disc special edition with extensive documentaries, behind the scenes, commentaries, etc. The first few of the movies in the series I had never seen in widescreen before. The picture quality of the films are excellent. The sound, too, is amazing. The only gripe I have is that you don't have the choice of watching the original movie with it's original effects. The director went back (it's a special director's cut) and had the studio do some updated effects. The new ones are alright, but I always try to watch a movie with it's original sound/effects. Still, this set is a must have for any Trek fan !
0156030306|3.0|I thought that this book was interesting.  It was also very sad.  Well written and an easy read.  It certainly did not strike me as profound and was not what I consider to be a \\"masterpiece\\".  As is the case with many of the books I read, I was expecting much more based on the reviews that I had read but I did enjoy the story.
B000AE8FN0|5.0|For every one who sees this product... its a GREAT shipment, really worth it!... you'll find the normal cd (first edition, non one with \\"first day of my life\\") but thats no problem (thats why the singles exist!!!)... well, the dvd its great, you'll find the \\"next best super star video\\", which its amazing and she looks gorgeous!, and \\"better alone\\", really cool bitter-love song, these ones, are the promotional vids.  <br /> <br />But no over yet!, theres a biography, epk with all the \\"behind the scenes\\" of beautiful intentions and \\"live\\" (not really live) presentations of beautiful intentions, next best super star & better alone; a photo gallery closed with a fastener of gold. <br /> <br />Thats what our Mss.

0618680004|4.0|Please allow me, before I offer a single observation on THE GOD DELUSION, to clarify two definitions just to be quite certain that we all share a common understanding of the terms. This will be critical if I am to have any hope of having my observations accepted by anyone kind enough to read these thoughts.<br /><br />First, let us recall that, in the early centuries of Christianity, the new religion came under frequent criticism from both Pagan and Jewish philosophers, and that their Christian counterparts felt called upon to defend their relatively new beliefs.  Such a defense, written or verbal, is properly labeled an \\"apology,\\" and it is in this sense that I shall use the word, that is, in its meaning as a defense, not as an expression of regret.  Second, let us look at the word \\"a-theist\\" for a moment.  The prefix \\"a,\\" which I've emphasize by setting it off with a hyphen, means \\"not.\\" It does not mean \\"anti-\\" or denote opposition.  Hence, an a-theist is merely one who does not support theism, which is defined as belief in one or more deities of some nature.  Our problem is that the words \\"atheist\\" and \\"atheism\\" have taken on pejorative connotations beyond their denotive functions so that their use arouses emotional reactions that impede communication and understanding.  Understanding this, however, perhaps we can now use the words without arousing unduly antagonistic emotion.<br /><br />With these definitions in mind, may I now classify THE GOD DELUSION as a classic apology for atheism?  The book is an \\"apology\\" in the sense that it presents a logical, reality-based defense of atheism, and it is \\"classic\\" in the somewhat ironic sense that it reminds the reader of the apologies written by Christian philosophers as the second and third centuries, C.E. (\\"Common Era,\\" or \\"A.D.\\" if one prefers).<br /><br />Will Dawkins' book convert those now full of faith to the paths of objective, observable, provable scientific inquiry?  Since \\"faith\\" can be defined as a conviction in a subjective, unobservable, and untestable idea for which neither evidence nor proof is sought or required, the answer is, of course, \\"No.\\"  If rationality is not to be considered, then no amount of rational logic or reason is going to impact the beliefs of the \\"faithful.\\"  Dawkins readily admits this and expresses the hope that, at most, his book may be just enough to help convince the fence-sitting agnostic to quit waffling and embrace atheism unequivocally.<br /><br />What, then, is the value of Dawkins' book?  For one thing, it certainly raised my awareness of the impact our linguistic practices have on our children, and how the language may psychologically predispose them to accept illogical faith in a probably non-existent deity over reason and logic. It points out how reference to a \\"Christian child\\" or a \\"Jewish child\\" or a \\"Muslim child\\" is truly ridiculous, for a child has neither the experience nor the reasoning power to decide on a belief system, be it one relying on faith or one based on observable reality.  One may refer to \\"a child of Christian (Jewish/Moslem, etc.) parents,\\" and that phrase is significantly different from \\"Christian (Jewish/Moslem, etc.) child.\\"<br /><br />The closing chapters of the book also heighten the reader's awareness of the many ways in which a scientific appreciation of the universe provides the explanation, exhortation, consolation and inspiration that religious apologists (defenders) claim for their non-scientific belief systems, showing that such belief systems are indeed not at all necessary for understanding existence, behaving morally, or finding joy in life.<br /><br />It is perhaps inevitable that we compare THE GOD DELUSION to Sam Harris' book THE END OF FAITH.  While I find no argument with Harris' thesis, I do find his writing to be somewhat strident, the written equivalent of being yelled at verbally.  Dawkins' writing, on the other hand, is consistently restrained, orderly, logical and reasonable.  In fact, one must pay close attention to Dawkins' sentences or risk losing one's mental way.  I do not mean to imply that his writing is obscure or obfuscated, but it does require active scrutiny by the reader.  I do not find him an \\"easy\\" author to read with full understanding.<br /><br />The fairly lengthy list of rationalist, humanist and a-theist Web sites at the back of the book is a pleasant surprise, and the bibliography suggests quite a few interesting books for further reading.<br /><br />Beyond the intellectual challenge of its prose, THE GOD DELUSION should challenge any reader who occasionally (or frequently) questions the logic of his or her faith-based belief system. It should challenge the \\"true believer\\" as well but probably won't because such a person is unlikely to read it.  While the book may be condemned as blasphemous by the \\"community of the faithful\\" and seen by rationalists as \\"preaching to the choir,\\" reading it can still be a consciousness-raising experience, and one could certainly do worse than spend some time with it.<br /><br />I wish my former high school classmate would read Dawkins' book--but she won't.  I vividly recall her shocked exclamation during a presidential election season when she caught sight of my campaign button: \\"(Gasp!)  DIDN'T YOUR MINISTER TELL YOU HOW TO VOTE!?\\"  With that true recollection, good reader, may I gently close with an admonishment that Dawkins' book really does need to be read?le.

0140288503|5.0|I would be concise about this thrilling book: It shows a modern combat in a dynamic narration that takes you in, without being an action novel. This is the real thing, very good written, and quite more catching that the movie, that is very well done. The Marines in my country watch the movie related to their urban combat training. A must read for any military student.
B000002J27|4.0|As is often commented, when Peter Gabriel left Genesis, the people wondered if the band could make it without him.  This is the first album after his departure, and it's very good.<br /><br />&#34;Dance on a Volcano&#34; and &#34;Squonk&#34; are among my favorite Genesis tunes, and all the songs are good.  It continues in a general way with the musical style of the previous albums. There are a lot of parallels with [[ASIN:B000002J1O Selling England by the Pound]]in particular.  Sadly they couldn't sustain it.  I would consider &#34;Trick of the Tail&#34; to be the last Genesis album worth owning.<br /><br />It needs to be said that the beginnings of the decline are evident on this album.  Phil Collins is a decent enough singer, but he doesn't have nearly the range or expressiveness of Peter Gabriel (not to mention the lyrics).  Also, previous albums were reaching for new heights, while this is the first album where Genesis is treading water.<br /><br />Still, I don't want to be negative.  Let make it clear that this is a very enjoyable album. Fans of the Gabriel era Genesis should check this one out.  Newcomers to the classic Genesis should check out their 4 best albums first:<br />[[ASIN:B00000DP01 Nursery Cryme]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000DP0O Foxtrot]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002J1O Selling England by the Pound]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002J1S The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]<br /><br />After that get this one and also [[ASIN:B000002NZO Trespass]], their second album, and &#34;Wind and Wuthering&#34;, the one after this.

B00007AJF9|5.0|A wonderful movie that absolutely commands your attention.  Cate blachette gives one heck of a performance and was robbed of an Oscar.  Then again, Judi Dench was pretty good in Mrs. brown too.  Lush costumes, great script, direction and an overlooked cinematic score.  Oh course kiddies, don't get your history lessons from Hollywood, but the film succeeds in getting you curious enough to start your own research on the amazing Virgin Queen.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|What a terrific movie- great comedic touches and delivery, original, fun. Hugh Grant- note-perfect as always, but this time mean it in musical sense as well. Great chemistry between Drew and Hugh, and nothing heavy handed about the fun it pokes in betweens the enjoyable romantic and character story lines. I Loved it! Great clever scenes, funny lines plus engaging story.  Big Kudos and thanks to all involved! Oh yeah, and the music was really fresh and catchy too. The last \\"soundtrack\\" album I bought was \\"Spamalot\\" and before that, I don't even remember when. I will definitely get this one for the recordings, but also to help me relive such a fun, high-quality movie.
1401207928|5.0|I admit, I never knew about this book until I saw the movie. I am certainly glad I did becuase it is very very powerful read. The plot is similar to the movie, yet very different. It's more complex and has all of the subtle details that make it that much better.  <br /> <br />My only complaint is that some of the dialog of the secondary characters is difficult for me to read and understand becuase it is written with a heavy english accent.  <br /> <br />The plot is very gripping, I found it difficult to put it down and read the whole thing in a couple of hours. Also, the concept of a graphic novel is new to me, I've never read one before so this was a new experience (that i enjoyed).  <br /> <br />All in all, this book is simply brilliant. If you liked the movie then READ THIS BOOK.
B00003CXBK|5.0|While some of ghibli's releases can have holes in the plot and unbalanced character design, this is not one of them.  The characters are believable and the plot never strays.  This is a beautifully done title and well worth adding to your collection.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|The movie had a slightly different plot than the original graphic novel but i think it worked out very well. I think that they should have filled in some of the \\"missing links\\" that could have been taken from the book (for example, more detail on the testing done at Larkhill, and how V escaped..ect). I also thought they did a great job portraying and using the chancellor, in the novel he wasn't nearly as involved. over all it is a very good movie, it sends a very powerful message.
B0000067L4|4.0|I am now circling around that now famous farm house in a sharecropper twin engine. I am leaving. Yes. I have my trusty laptop here to write this review. You see, I had to leave. With Bossy eating all my food and that incessant rooster each morning-it was all too much for your beloved Metamorpho. Besides, I was fearful that my reviews would become tepid in that quiet atmosphere. Ahhhh...poor Bossy. I can see her languid, sad eyes from here. Wait...is that a tear I see? Do cows cry? I will ask my guides. Definitely a question for the ages.<br /><br />Cream's fourth and final album (from that era) comprised many of the same elements that \\"Wheels of Fire\\" did. In it, they bring out fine live performances on \\"I'm So Glad\\", \\"Politician\\" and \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\". In some instances they are superior to the original studio versions. That said, their jams are most noteworthy for their expert play and interplay. It is good to here raw, live sound. However, not everyone may be happy with their excess. It all depends on what side of the barn you chose, so to moo. In any event, Baker, Bruce and Clapton give all musicians notice with their talent.<br /><br />The rest of the album are studio originals. The best of these, I feel, is Clapton's \\"Badge\\". Starts off fine enough with the addition of piano. But it soon reveals itself with the insistent middle, allowing Clapton to add some spicy guitar work. I won't interpret the lyrics and I won't argue with swans who live in the pond. Who could? Bossy lives on a farm. Take that Eric! Then it's Jack Bruce's turn with \\"Doing that Scrapyard Thing\\". It is too sing-song for my taste. And, again, the words prove nothing but psychedelic rants. Not as interesting as his songs on \\"Wheels of Fire\\". However, the jumpy rythmn of Ginger's \\"What a Bringdown\\" proves to be another surprise from him. Nothing exceptional - but a nice sprightly tune in it's own right. The original tunes here do sound like Cream was winding down at the time. No timely riffs, no awesom bass or drums. Too bad they broke up but by judging this, I can see they were really tired after their burst of creativity. Still - I gave this 4 and 1/2 because Cream on a bad day was still better than most on a good one.<br /><br />Well, that's it. I do have some surprises for you next. It has already been thought out. Like chess, your Metamorpho is always two or three steps ahead. I am now heading home to my Scottish Castle and my warm fireplace. It is there where I will contemplate my next ponderous, anxious mayhem.<br /><br />Moo-ving right along --your delectable Metamorphono awesom bass or drums.

B000J103X4|5.0|I love this album. Although it's easy to take sides on the beefs that have been going down within the parent label, when the music is considered, this is one of the better albums of the year. Game brings his gritty persona and flow blazing, and it's obvious he is eager to prove his spot in hip-hop. With a number of club-worthy hits and gritty street rap, I'd recommend this album to all fans of hip-hop.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|The movie, what was of it, followed the author's book pretty closely, However I think that they could have added much more to it. I think they left out vital information that may cause people who have not read the book to wonder what it's all about.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|Considering that this album was supposed to be a mix-tape, it delivers on a number of areas. If your looking for a cd to bump at a party or club, other than \\"You Don't Know\\" there aren't any true party hits: this is album is pure, un-cut hip-up. Cashis and Bobby Creekwater exceeded my expectations, both showcasing lyrical skill and original personas, creating anticipation for future albums. Obie Trice blazes something impressive, and although not dissapointing, Stat Quo seemed to be holding back on the tracks he cut. D12 was also slightly dissapointing with their performance, delivering what i would call below-average flows (with exception to proof, RIP). Eminem and 50 cent come out blazing, with Eminem weaving his pattented lyrical webs and Fif' returning to his Get rich or Die tryin' formula. This album accomplished exactly what it was meant to: showcase the talent that Shady records is working with and establishing these rappers as some of the best in the game.
1400032717|5.0|What a magnificent book. Christopher Boone is an autistic 15-year-old who finds a neighbour's dog has been killed in her garden. He sets out to solve the crime. Mark Haddon does an outstanding job of putting us into the mind of a savant with severe learning and social disabilities. <br /> <br />Anybody who has known someone with Asperger's Syndrome, Non-verbal learning disability, ADHD, autism or any of that large spectrum of illnesses will instantly recognize Christopher's voice. He's a young man who, to calm himself down, solves complex equations in his head but who, if he sees three yellow cars in a row on his way to school, knows the day is going to be a black one. Mark Haddon's skill is that Christopher's view of the world makes perfect sense. Who is to say which of us is the more mentally challenged, Christopher or the reader? <br /> <br />I found the book a terrific eye-opener into the world of autism. I loved it. <br /> <br />According to the fly-leaf Mark Haddon teaches creative writing. I wish I lived close enough to be one of his students. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LC55F2|4.0|`The Prestige' has all the credentials to be an important film, including the usually misguidedly gushing blurb from Peter Travers of `Rolling Stone', who seems to hail all sorts of overreaching films. The most notable thing about the film is the cast, including an impressive list of both young talents, such as Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson, plus venerable older and more experienced names such as Michael Caine and the brilliantly elusive David Bowie. The director, as the filmmaker for the acclaimed `Batman Begins', Christopher Nolan, is also a talent not to be taken lightly. And yet, through all the dark twists and turns, the movie never seems to elicit any strong sympathies for the characters and the Byzantine byways of flashbacks and surprises.<br /><br />The keystone which holds the plot together is the use of the historical character of scientist and engineer, Nicoli Telsa, the inventor of alternating current and competitor with Thomas Edison, the proponent of direct current (Telsa's doctrines ultimately won; however, Edison gets most of the fame and fortune for introducing electrification to the world). Telsa, played with delightful mystery by Bowie, is contracted by one of the two principle character magicians, Robert Angier (played by Jackman), to build him an apparatus for a fabulous new trick. While the trick has lots of special on-stage effects from man-made static electrical charges, it may be seen as nothing more than the usual tired disappearing man trick. The two features which make it more entrancing are the fact that the disappearance is done without the aid of boxes or curtains, and the magician reappears almost instantly from the back of the audience. This trick, and its macabre little twist serve as the climax; however the main body of the story is driven by a highly improbable occurrence when one of the two magician team, Alfred Borden (played by Bale) makes a mistake in the setup for a trick, leading to the accidental death of Angier's wife when a trick goes bad and the woman cannot escape from submersion in a tank of water. The improbabilities are twofold. One, it is highly unlikely that an experienced magician would make that kind of mistake, then forget whether he made it or not. Second, it is improbable that the margin of error between the time the mistake is detected and emergency escape measures are taken would be so small, leading to the death of the magician's subject. And, this improbable event drives the entire plot of the story.<br /><br />These improbabilities are muted just a bit by the jigsaw nature of the movie's timeline. We seem to be jumping around so much between `present' and flashbacks that it's hard to be sure when and where we are at any given point in time. One thriller / surprise ending movie which comes to mind in evaluating this story is the original `The Manchurian Candidate', based on an improbable premise, but so well written, directed, and acted that we form great bonds of sympathy for the main characters, strengthened, at least at the time the movie was released, by a political climate which made the film far less improbable seeming than it actually was. And, the ending was in fact a great, unexpected surprise.<br /><br />The surprise ending of `The Prestige' is signaled by several different clues, some revealed relatively early in the film; however, to be honest, I didn't really put everything together until the end. The strength of the surprise ending is from both the revelation of `the facts of the case' plus the remarkably devious plan to which the physical circumstances are put to resolve the conflict set in motion by the death of the magician's wife.<br /><br />In the end, the premise driving the plot is not sufficiently believable, and we never really connect emotionally with the characters. Even Jackman's Wolverine character in the X-Men movies seems to elicit more sympathy than his far more realistic character here.<br /><br />This is better than many `special effects fests' such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Remarkable Gentlemen', and it's twists and turns will probably deserve a second and third viewing to get everything straight, but this is very good second rate moviemaking, not worthy of exceptional praise.s better than many `special effects fests' such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Remarkable Gentlemen', and it's twists and turns will probably deserve a second and third viewing to get everything straight, but this is very good second rate moviemaking, not worthy of exceptional praise. <br />

B000EULJLU|4.0|I'll make this short and bittersweet unlike this latest release from the boys from TOOL. Well kiddies, I have been a loyal, adoring fan of this band since the days of \\"Opiate\\" and the days of the first lollapalooza <br />when music was actually good. Most music since the year of 1996 and beyond, well most mainstream music, has really sucked. I feel so sorry for the teenagers these days who are subjected to a myriad cross section of disposable and completely emotionless crap-rock and alternative music these days. I got to go see bands like nine inch nails, nirvana, janes addiction, ministry, rage against the machine, helmet, pantera, sepultura, and yes Tool back in their younger days(live) and they sounded better live than on their cd(undertow). I saw them in houston at this place that used to be a supermarket called the international ballroom and it was a very cool and intimate experience because they had just released undertow and nobody hardly knew who they were. I heard of them by watching an interview with frontman Perry Farrell(janes addiction) mentioning them. They are in my opinion the only rock band out there that are truly Artists. This is a concept album like every pink floyd album(forgive the comparison). Every tool album is a different piece of art. An experience. Don't go digging for singles on this album or any of their albums. Just buy the ticket and take the ride as hunter s. thompson would say and support and appreciate these guys because like all truly good artists they might not be around for much longer and to all of you youngsters who haven't seen this band live I urge you, no I beg you to go do just that ASAP!!!!!!
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This film is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and one of the top movies of the last 50 years.  It develops out of very unlikely material, and is entirely a product of Kubrick's driving, single minded will and control.<br /><br />Based on a William Thackery novel, the story is what used to be called in art and literature, \\"the rake's progress\\" -- take a low born rascal through a series of fortuitous episodes which land him in wealth, then watch his bad character unmake him through another series of episodes.  The set-up reinforced social stereotypes inherent in the British class system; low bred men are inferior.  Thackery was bigger than that, of course, but like all artists was a man of his time and the crack in the product widens with age -- here, the assumed genetic and social inferiority of an Irishman.  Then you have fascinating stuff like decades long European wars, but nobody much is taught about this anymore.  Kubrick picked a deck heavily stacked against him for this tour de force.<br /><br />And cinematic tour de force it is -- all shot in natural light, narrative (other than adjusting the 1st person voice of the novel to 3rd) straight out of its time.  Nor does Kubrick update moods, dialogue, social assumptions like Amadeus -- he gives you a film that looks like it was actually shot 2 centuries ago, and impresses you with the absolute alienness of many of the characters.  You are hit with how changeable human society is, and yes, very cooly distanced.  Thus the pacing and emotional distance appall many viewers, who think this is because the picture has \\"dated\\"  -- no, it was intended and designed to be exactly the way it is.  To not understand this is to not understand the movie; one's dislike may be very genuine, but Kubrick's intentionality has a grand subtle effect:  the tables are turned on Thackery's social determinism.  And the film is so faithful to Thackery that Kubrick here delivers a major lesson:  the only difference is placing a camera in it.  One must remember that Kubrick started out as a photographer and that art is central to his entire ethos and point of view.  Thus too, the silent but spectacular visual message goes, pictures now make us appalled by the tragedy of war, by the realities of racial and social discrimination -- the camera itself is at  near the root of many modern revolutions.<br /><br />While the rake remains a rake, O'Neal brings wit to the part under Kubrick's tutelage and a large degree of empathy.  Barry Lyndon -- a character now captured on film, no longer just the page -- is seen caught in an invisible social matrix, not only in the assumed inferiority of his origins.  The camera focuses uncompromisingly on lords, kings, soldiers, ladies, 18th century con men, roadside bandits -- all.  The mercilessness of the whole enterprise would be wholly unpalatable but for the splendour and fullness of life recreated here, and the fire of Kubrick's eccentric passion to portray it.<br /><br />Memorable scenes are too many to catalogue; every performance is great, some despite the distance of time and vision are absolutely wrenching.  Child actors, a Kubrick specialty, were never used better by him.  If, all said, the film lacks the glow of love and humanism, the compensation is heavy wisdom and a startling piece of learning.  With this film, Kubrick establishes the camera not only as a step forward in technology, but a teacher fit to take its place next to the pen, the violin, the artist's canvas.t.

1400064287|5.0|A book to make better communicators of us all. One of the better marketing and sales communication books I have ever read. It may even turn out to be the best this year. The two authors came to these ideas from two very different directions which makes the impact even stronger. Lesson learned, the impact of clear stories is profound and underrated. Its true whether its an Aesop fable, a classic style like David and Goliath, the Good Samaritan or Newton and his apple. Anyone who has to \\"tell others\\" about a project, a goal, a report, anything that needs to be easily understood and remembered, will benefit from reading this book. And the listeners will benefit too! Early in my career I learned it takes really smart people to find the simple clear explanation. This book is proof of that! Quick read, easy to understand, a lifetime to get it right. Deserves to be on every CEOs' bookshelf.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|After hearing all the hype and being told by a close friend who attends the Sundance Festival every year I decided to buy this wonderful movie.  It's a movie for all ages and the presentation is colorful.  It's truly a classic.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Great characters and is consistent with Miyazaki's strong female character tendencies. An extraordinarily detailed and complex world where mom and dad get turned into pigs and you have to work at bathhouse for the spirits of Japan to do what is necessary to free them, and as it turns out a number of other characters.  <br /> <br />The English voice overs were done very well, though I suggest you check it out in Japanese with English subtitles too as the voice work in the original language is part of the total picture.
B00005O3VC|5.0|The movie is funny. It is British humor, so it takes a little to get used to, but it is a great movie. The sillyness of the movie is what makes it funny. Knights on imaginary horses. A killer Vorpal rabbit that attacks them. It also makes fun of the fuedal system.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Based on Steven Millhauser's short story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\", the film takes place in the early 1900's in Vienna when a young magician falls in love with a girl, Sophie, from a higher social class. They are separated and they spend years without seeing each other. One night, Eisenheim is onstage performing an illusion and requires someone from the crowd to assist him. To his great surprise, Sophie climbs onstage but she doesn't recognize him at first. Eisenheim learns that she is engaged to a prince who has a reputation for not being the nicest man around women. Something will happen that will change the course of things and will put Eisenheim against the prince and his trusty inspector.<br /><br />The Illusionist is certainly one of 2006's best films. I went in to see this movie not knowing what to expect -- having stopped myself from seeing any trailers or TV spots. It's a wonderful film that pulls you in from the first frame. The cinematography is beautiful and the score haunting. Norton, Biel, and Giamatti all give stellar performances.<br /><br />This was director Neil Burger's second film; his first being Interview with the Assassin, a mockumentary on the Kennedy assassination which I have yet to see. I'm curious as what he'll do next; his screenwriting and directing skills impressed me with The Illusionist.<br /><br />This is the kind of film which I can safely say will appeal to almost anyone. It has a great plot, compelling characters, and a clever ending. Whether you like drama, suspense, or fantasy, I think you'll find a bit of everything in this movie. Highly recommended!
B000LE0TGA|4.0|\\"Out of the Blue\\" sounds better than ever! This reissue sounds terrific with much better dynamic range, better clarity and sharper sounding music than ever before. This edition features a 12 page booklet discussing the making of the album and some amusing stories about the tour with the giant spaceship to support the album. An excellent album from Lynne and company, \\"Out of the Blue\\" caught the band at their creative and musical pinnacle. This edition features the booklet but not a replica of the promo items in a standard jewel box. By the way, if you have the first pressing Japanese edition of this on CD reportedly this isn't a huge improvement on the sound quality from that release. It does however have a great bonus track and a good instrumental new to the CD. Be aware that the master tapes do have a couple of drop outs that occur (particularly at the beginning of \\"It's Over\\")but given the age of the tapes (and how unstable the tapes were during the 70's), I'm not surprised. I am a bit surprised that these drop outs weren't digitally repaired (I'm sure they could have been) but overall I'm very pleased with this terrific album.<br /><br />I have read some complaints that his doesn't compare or improve on previous editions. Actually, it depends on which edition you have. The Japanese edition (where the album was divided over two discs reportedly still sounds the best--keep in mind that loudness doesn't always equate to better sound as the signal may have been compressed and much of the dynamic range lost, etc.--that said this sounds to my ears much better than the previous American edition mastered by Joe Gastwirt (who probably did the best with what he had at hand within the time frame he had). Sadly, no one thought to ever put this out in an audiophile edition (that would make sense given the sales and appeal of the band)which is a pity because of all of ELO's recordings this has the sonic detail and lush soundscapes that demand it. Nevertheless, this version sounds really good.<br /><br />This is one of ELO's most infectious albums and while it may lack some of the more experimental touches on the band's first three albums, there are plenty of melodic experiments here such as the sythsizer driven \\"The Whale\\". \\"Turn to Stone\\" has never sounded so good on CD before. While the band would continue to put out hits after this, \\"Out of the Blue\\" captured the band at a commerical and artistic climax. They never got better than this!<br /><br />We get three bonus tracks. The first is an alternate bridge for the song \\"Wild West Hero\\" and runs about 24 seconds. The second is an unfinished instrumental \\"The Quick and the Daft\\" that runs under a minute and a half. The last is \\"Latitude 88 North\\" which Lynne finished for this reissue. It's a terrific song that would have fit in well with the rest of the album. I'm glad that Lynne went back to finish it as it makes a fitting finish to a terrific album.unds really good.<br /><br />This is one of ELO's most infectious albums and while it may lack some of the more experimental touches on the band's first three albums, there are plenty of melodic experiments here such as the sythsizer driven \\"The Whale\\". \\"Turn to Stone\\" has never sounded so good on CD before.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver was an excellent book that could be appreciated by anyone over the age of about eight. The setting is a community that is secluded from all other parts of the world. The environment in which these people live is quite unlike society today and the people are deprived of memories, feelings, sexual desires, and having true bonds with others. Each person in the novel is given an assignment, not unlike assignments that are given in communist societies. The main character, Jonas, is given the daunting task of being The Receiver. In doing his job, he must receive all of the memories of the world in order to shelter the other members of the community from the pain they are associated with. Jonas has a difficult time accepting some of the ways of the community, and the character vs. society conflict occurs throughout the entire plot.   <br />The most interesting part of this novel is the fact that it can be directly connected to our lives in society today. Ways that people think and react to each other are portrayed quite accurately throughout the novel, whether it be one's unwillingness to listen or the general acceptance of the way things have been done in the past. It is also easy to see how people today take what they have for granted such as love or even relationships. This novel is an eye opener and I would undoubtedly recommend it to any person of any age.  <br />
B000MCH5P4|5.0|It is an intoxicating and powerful tour de force that gets close and personal leaving you stunned by its universal and truthful wisdom.    It's interesting to look up the meaning of 'Babel' and it where it has come from.  Babel was actually the tower that early mankind set out to build in their prideful attempts to reach heaven.  This angered God and thus God sought to disrupt the project by making everyone involved speak different languages and scattered them amongst the planet.  This story is said to be the first-struck origin of globization spelled out in the book of Genesis. Babel is often defined as a confusion of language, sounds or voices.  This is relevant to the epic of this movie in that it takes on three stories at four different locations with spoken languages remote and confused from one another.  We begin the journey in Morrocco where a gun is sold to a goat farmer to kill and ward off jakal. This gun is then handed over to Farmer's sons, competively starved for attention, set off to kill jakal with obscured intentions in order the protect their goat herd. Close and yet seperate for their struggle to prove their worth amongst the family, they accidentally set off an incident that is the catalyst for the global scale butterfly effect.    This gun is actually the focal point and the tie in between the three stories.   Babel is quite literally the cause for the confusion, distance and struggle for unity, peace and comfort.  This story couldn't reign any truer in our modern times and has spoke simple brilliance in the tone of a pebble dropped and rippled in a quiet pond.  I disagree with anyone who says this film is too preachy.  I think the messages conveyed are subtle yet powerful, heart-felt, universal and true in each stroke of its brilliant editing, writing, cinematography and soundtrack.  I think it is a message of passion for understanding of other cultures or other circumstance.  To perhaps escape from our own narrow perspectives and spend a littlemore effort trying to understand others through open-mindedness and by doing everything we can to seperate ourselves from our Babel curse.      Next in line, we have an American couple on a tour-guide through Morrocco who are at the bitter point of taking life and each other easily for granted.  They are entrapped in petty arguments and petty drama hoping probably that the distance of their trip would change the undertow of their lives.    We find out later that it takes a whole lot more than that.  A rude awakening sent from the towers of Babylon itself.    I would have to agree with some of other reviews here that the story of the Japanese deaf mute school-girl and her father take on a very powerful depth of intoxicating layers.  She has been familiar with the term Babel all her life as communication with others often falls flat on its face.  Rarely getting through to others, she often uses radical measures to be heard.  Each radical step leaving her empty handed, she struggles desperately to be comforted.  Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie being her cling to strangers where she takes drugs and enters a rave.  With finally perhaps a surge of hope, you find yourself tapping your foot with the music.  Later to be jarred by a sudden slap as the scene quickly takes you to her perspective of hollowed silence.  Making you realize how quickly and often we forget the other person's circumstance.  As if flipping the switch quickly on the soundtrack, we have no choice but to be left stunned as were are left with music then silence.  It is quite powerful.     Ameila, the family maid/nanny of the American couple (Brad and Cate) has been the care-taker of their children since their birth.  Because the couple's vacation has been extended due to unforseen circumstance, she is forced to take the children to mexico so that she can attend her son's wedding.  The highlights of this story for me would have to be the wedding scene and their attempt to cross through the border  back into the U.S.  The wedding scene is heart-felt, pure and real.  It is utterly fun and amusing.  A true encounter of a mexican family in celebration of such a wonderful event. To contrast this, we have the border scene filled with mis-understandings, fear and irrationality.  The dark recluse and cold of police officers and govt caring more about their job and policies then the compassion and real justice of human-kind.  This is further induced by the concept of Babel that echoes throughout the entire film.    This film is exceptionally binding and powerful, a modern tale of  Babel towers being built and then torn down.
0143038419|2.0|Gilbert is a such a clever writer with a fresh breezy style, that I looked forward to reading her memoir.  Turns out, I was disappointed, probably because it was written with book advance in hand rather than after the fact (Heisenberg uncertainty principal at work here).  I suspect that there may also have been an publisher lurking, eager not to offend any book-buying audience.  The tale struck me as intellectually dishonest.<br /><br />How could a intelligent woman devoting an entire year to self-discovery and sharing her deepest thoughts...<br /><br />...refuse at the outset to discuss whether she believes God exists or not, yet go on to place a deity in most all the locations/contexts in which any reader of any religion (or none!) might nod agreement.  This stuck me as disingenuous at best, pandering at worst.<br /><br />...not explore other rational paths which might be fruitful for her admittedly depressed and medicated mental condition. I suppose psychology, brain science, etc. are not the stuff of romantic, feel-better books.<br /><br />...not pack (or mention) a single book in her shipment to Italy about how the brain/mind works.  She tells us about having discussed electro-chemical brain activity during meditation with a knowledgeable friend, but left the impression that the phenomenon supported a central spiritual focal point in the brain - and a blue one, no less.  Perhaps a neuroscientist could comment on this representation.  I found it dishonest.<br /><br />...proclaim \\"tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth\\" and not do so.<br /><br />Given her writing talent, if I trusted her, I would read more of her books.  But I do not, so I will not.
0743298020|3.0|I read this after reading all the great reviews on Amazon and found myself disappointed. Entirely too much unneccessary detail that didnt progress the story one iota. Found myself reading half a page at times wondering what the heck is she trying to convey and why. Descent enough story underneath.
0143036556|4.0|This is a very thought-provoking book.  The prose is easy to read and free of technical jargon.   <br /> <br />The first chapter (about the Bitteroot valley in Montana) provides and excellent context for the remaining discussions because it allows the reader to see the process unfolding in a contemporary setting that is easy to relate to.  As an American living in the western U.S., I can relate situation and the conflicting priorities that drive social decision-making.
B000059TEP|5.0|I'm not sure why I never watched \\"Ghost\\" before until last night.  For some reason, I didn't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on TV.  I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a GOOD movie.  What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural.  That would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance.  I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  There were a few \\"convenient\\" capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work.  I'm a rather pragmatic person but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the story that I WANTED these things to be possible.   <br /> <br />Obviously, the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well.  I wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching \\"Ghost\\".  I was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with Whoopie Goldberg so I want to confess that I thought her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well-deserved.  I figure that I was one of the last persons in America to see \\"Ghost\\" but if there are others of you out there who still haven't seen it, give it a look; it's well worth it.
B000002H6C|5.0|Every metal fan seems to have a particular album that they remember fondly as being the defining moment, the album that caused them to get into the fantastically dark realm of heavy music. For me, Metallica's \\"...and Justice For All\\" is that album. It simply blew my mind at the time and I distinctly recall being somewhat bewildered by its speed and aggression, while at the same time, completely fascinated. I was hooked from the first listen and thank my older brother to this very day for thrusting it upon my up-until-then innocent psyche. While another 19 years (man I'm getting old!) of metal experience has given me plenty of reasons why this album isn't the holy grail of all things metal that I once thought it was, and in fact isn't even Metallica's best release, it still holds a nostalgic place in my heart, and it is a damn fine album despite it's flaws. <br /> <br />\\"...and Justice For All\\" is the last classic Metallica album. While 1991's black album is quite good, and managed to break the band into the mainstream in a massive way, they would never again create anything near as awesome as the period between 1984 and 1988. 1986's \\"Master of Puppets\\" is the standout release, and it's not surprising that the band tried to repeat the formula with \\"...and Justice For All\\". Both albums start and finish with fast, shredding tracks. Both albums have a great ballad as track 4. Both albums have an epic instrumental as the second last tracks. Clearly, the band knew they were onto a winner and made an obvious attempt to reproduce it. <br /> <br />One of the things that you will often hear said about this album is that the production is quite weak. While I don't think it's all that bad, it definitely could have been better, with the bass in particular being almost completely indiscernible. It's the first Metallica album to contain Jason Newsted instead of the legendary Cliff Burton (RIP) who was killed in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986, but Jason isn't able to make any sort of impression here. The rest of the band put in fine performances with Kirk Hammett in particular displaying his incredible talent for writing technically fantastic yet audibly superb music. Lars is solid if not amazing on the drums and James is at the top of his game on rhythm and vocal duties. James' vocals should never be underestimated. Although his aggressive style is undeniably metal, the man can actually sing when he puts his mind to it. Metallica's lyrics at this point were quite intelligent and political in nature, and James sang them with both conviction and aptitude. <br /> <br />With tracks such as \\"Blackened\\", \\"One\\", \\"Dyers Eve\\" along with the title track, there's an abundance of quality. The album only really slackens off a bit for \\"The Shortest Straw\\" and \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\", but even those two are decent enough. If nothing else, \\"...and Justice For All\\" is a classic thrash album and one of the highpoints in Metallica's initially illustrious career. For me though, it's so much more. It's the reason I've devoted so much of my life to heavy metal music, and I raise the devil's horns in immense appreciation.
B00000DFSK|1.0|I always knew U2 sucks!!! A friend of mine who is a huge fan of U2 and she kept on pushing me to listen to it and once I listened and I was like WTF is this??? and she kept telling me that U2 are always the best but I knew U2 is horrible!!! I believe she was trying to make me buy all of their albums so she could be able to get it from me for FREE but I am not that dumb!!! I told her we all cant have the SAME taste of music we all are different and we all have our own taste. So sorry friend I rate this 1 STAR!!! and yeah I have a message for U2: get lost!!! you guys are not worth to be a singer!!! You guys are terrible!!! You guys dont work too hard for this BS!!! *throw up*
B00011RPB0|4.0|We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date..
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I usually never write reviews for CD's that I have bought but I HAD to take the time to write a review about Corinne Bailey Rae's CD. <br />From the first track to the last and every song in between I have never been more impressed with one singer and one CD then I was with this one. Her beautiful voice lit up every single one of these songs for me. I have had this CD in my car player for the last three weeks and it is the only music I listen to over and over again. I even downloaded her entire CD to my IPOD and computer so that I could listen to it when I am in the house or working out as well... I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who loves soul, blues, jazz, and even country. You will not be disappointed.
0671015206|5.0|This is a great book that I was advised to read by Dave Ramsey, a financial guru. It's very easy to read and understand. It gives you a whole new way to view the way you spend and save your money. Very good read.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We bought Cars for our 2 1/2 year old as soon as it came out and I've lost count at how many times we've watched it together. First, it's just plain beautiful to look at. The computer animation is absolutely state of the art and makes things like Toy Story look downright crude by comparison.  <br />     <br />Secondly, it creates characters you can love and laugh with. All the actors who do the voices are fantastic! The story is heartwarming and gives a great message, without being condescending or politically correct. There is lots of humor for kids, as well as subtle stuff for parents to enjoy too. <br />     <br />My only complaint I was hoping for more Bonus Feature material. The two short films \\"Mater and the Ghostlight\\" and \\"One Man Band\\" are great and I guess I just wish there were more extras like them. The storyboard type stuff was so-so. <br />     <br />I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie. I can't remember the last movie I enjoyed watching over and over again so much. Seems like every time I watch it, I see some new little subtle thing I missed before. Oh yeah, our son loves it too! I only hope Disney releases a Platinum Edition with more CG extras. And no, I don't work for Disney/Pixar. <br />
B000065VB0|5.0|In the summer of 1980, I had just completed my freshman year of college, and I had a job working on disadvantaged peoples' homes in Appalachia. Beforehand, I had made approximately 80 tapes of my favorite albums (this was pre-cd era, mind you) to listen to on a tinny cassette player. As the summer wore on, I found myself listening to two albums repeatedly: The Stones' Exile on Main Street, and Peter Gabriel's Third (Melt). Twenty-six years later, Gabriel's work has lost none of its power. It is an amazing album, full of details that will reward the careful listener. Much has been made of the decision to eliminate cymbals from the percussion - at the time that was a radical departure. Compared to other 80's recordings, the synths are not overly dated, and (unfortunately) the lyrics are still applicable to today's headlines. This is one for the ages.

B000F7CMRM|4.0|\\"Syriana\\", directed by Stephen Gaghan, is an engaging film that tackles many different stories at the same time. All of them have something in common, though: the oil industry, and the people that have some kind of relationship with it.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it is a little difficult to keep track of the diverse stories that \\"Syriana\\" comprises, it is well worth the effort, due to the fact that it allows the spectator to understand what is at stake for different people in the oil industry, and how a decision made by one of them affects the rest. What does Bob (George Clooney), a CIA operative, has to do with a poor immigrant who works in an oil field, or with a young reformist prince (Alexander Siddig)? And what do a broker (Matt Damon) and a lawyer (Jeffrey Wright) that don't know each other have to do with all of them? Oil, power, corruption and manipulation are the main subjects in \\"Syriana\\". This film is fiction, but some of its elements could well be truth, and that makes you think.<br /><br />On the whole, I think \\"Syriana\\" is a complicated movie, but one that deserves your time and attention. If you don't mind the fact that you must follow several stories at once, and that this film is undeniably serious and doesn't have any kind of comic relief, I think you will enjoy \\"Syriana\\". I know I did...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000K7VHQE|5.0|So many hilarious scenes that keep you laughing weeks after you even watch the movie.  It's got a great story line too, the audience comes out feeling, \\"if they can make it work, maybe my family has hope too.\\"  You absolutely have to watch the very ending, its the funniest scene in the entire movie, hands down.  You might compare this to a modern day National Lampoon's Family Vacation, only alot better!!!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I could not believe how bad this movie was.  What romantic comedy elements there were were drowned out by paltry storyline after paltry (read:completely undeveloped) storyline, involving multitudes of movie stars, being thrown in the face of the viewer.  It was very much as if they were trying too hard to make a successful romantic comedy.  There was nothing at all romantic or even sentimental about these storylines and that they could expect us to suspend our disbelief with no plot depth at all was, well, unbelievable.<br /><br />More offensive than the extremely bad writing though was the gratuitous addition of pornographic material.  One of the many storylines crammed into the film is that of two \\"actors\\" doing a porn film who are apparently in love and when not filming oral sex scenes are going on perfectly innocent dates where both behave in a very shy and restrained manner.<br /><br />If there was an audience for this kind of story, it likely isn't all the same type of person who is looking for the next When Harry Met Sally and I wish this movie had, if nothing else, been advertised differently.  In fact, I wish I had never seen it and amidst my disgust at having purchased it, gave away my copy with a strong warning regarding its contents.<br /><br />Let's keep romantic comedy romantic and porn in the porn aisle.  Because if this is what happens when you get the genres confused, it just shouldn't happen.  And as to bad writing, well...there is no cure for it and romantic comedies do seem especially prone to it.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|These guys definitely know how to write music.  Their pieces flow very well and its fun just to listen to the whole album.  I love the theme of knights and horses.  Although this album may not be as great as Absolution, it still shows their musical talent.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I liked this movie.  I loved The Illusionist.  Having said that, this is a fun movie with lots of twists and turns and full of good, solid entertainment value. The acting trio of Michael Caine, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman lends a strong dynamic stability to the film.  The funnest thing about it for me was the fun conversation after the movie with friends who enjoyed dissecting and speculating the storyline.  Its good exposure too for the underknown Tesla.
B000HCO83G|4.0|Great action scenes but the movie almost has too much going on.  They dropped Nightcrawler which made me pretty upset and they never added Gambit.  Not at all as good as the first two, but still a great ending to the trilogy.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I don't understand the bad rap for this album.  Amnesiac is an amazing achievement.  While I don't recommend this album to newcomers, I do think that every real fan should have this one in their collection. <br /> <br />The harsh ratings are what kept me from listening to Amnesiac for so long.  I decided to buy it recently and now I can say without a doubt that this is my favorite Radiohead album.  Everything is just done right and there really is little-to-no filler. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and give this one a chance.  Different does not always mean bad.
B000J103PC|4.0|There's a moment in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" in which Anne Hathaway's character crosses the invisible line that separates her boss's public and private life -- and Meryl Streep gives her this look.  That's all...a look.  And there's more in that single look than most other actresses put into entire performances.  It conveys an extraordinary mix of disbelief, rage, vulnerability and a weird kind of admiration that's impossible to describe -- and all without a single word being spoken.  That's the kind of hidden pleasure one gets in this surprisingly substantial adaptation of what I gather was pretty skin-deep chick lit.  Having not read the book, I can't speak for the film as an adaptation, but as \\"disposable\\" entertainment, it's fast, funny and very, very entertaining.  The screenplay is snappy, the fashions are, of course, fabulous, and the supporting cast is (almost) up to Ms. Streep's standards, particularly the hilarious Emily Blunt.  Don't expect \\"profound\\" -- and why would you? -- and you'll be in for a rewarding two hour's worth of cinematic eye candy.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|It's easy to say that this is a waste of time and money, but for true fans it truly is worth it. The novel, the script, and even nice little postcards are a nice edition, but if you have the special edition version, dont drop 40 bucks for a few extra trinkets. You see, i never seen Advent Children(i know right)so this was a natural choice to make. Now to those saying it's not worth the money period, get this. Square are saying the technical demo for FFVII wasn't intended to make people think a remake in the works(but never said they WOULDNT EVER make it) and now this nice little DVD set comes out, and a LOT of people buy it. Square sees the potential profit off of making FFVII ANYTHING as  you might of noticed. But if hardly anybody buys this stuff, whats to make them believe that after they pour millions upon millions on a remake, that it can get them that profit back and then some...Think about it
B00003CXA2|4.0|I love Tom Hanks and have wanted this movie for a long time. It's the best!
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Bought at an airpot and figured it would be a sleeper.  To my surprise it was quite capturing from the first couple pages.  Susie Salmon tragically & abruptly taken away from earth and transported into a plane in where we all have questioned at one time or another.  A beautifully written novel about love, understanding, perseverance and finally justice. It was very hard to put it down.  Although the ending was far from where i though it would lead, it made me understand that the authors message was one of reassurance to life's grief of loss.
0596007124|5.0|So much good, so easy to read, so comprehensive... if you're interested in design patterns, go and buy it. now. why is that you're not reading it already? <br /> <br />Now, in fact, it's one of the best-ever bought books I have ever bought. It has a place next to Code Complete.
0060887966|5.0|The translation of this book leaves it to be less challenging.  Reading the book in spanish and english enabled me to truly admire the writings of Mr. Coehlo.  Talented, subtle and a moving fable about a young Santiago in the search of his vision.  I was able to walk with him along his journey and also align my life experiences with that of the story. You might want some post its to come back to re-read. Easy read for alot of interpretation and real life comparisons.  Recommended to readers of ages 12+.  Must have for a library at home!

0618001905|4.0|King Leopold's Ghost<br /><br /> I began reading Adam Hochhild's excellent \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" shortly after reading \\"The Last Expedition: Stanley's Mad Journey Across Africa.\\"  The relationship between the two is clear:  Stanley was King Leopold's \\"Go To\\" Guy in the unfortunately named \\"Congo Free State,\\" which was neither Free nor a state.<br /> It was open season on Africa; the European kingdoms and principalities saw the enormous economic advantages of a toehold in Africa, and wasted no time on niceties like human rights.<br /><br />Some in Europe,including Arthur Conan Doyle,Roger Casement, and E.D. Morel,  were appalled by Stanley's adventurism and Leopold's imperialism. An \\"Open Letter\\" from George Washington Williams, a Black American  writer, surfaced which detailed the human rights abuses of the regime-- including the cutting off of hands and fingers of Rubber Plantation workers.<br />Another European who investigated reports of humanitarian abuses in the Congo was British Consul Roger Casement, who produced his \\"Report on the Congo\\" in 1903, detailing the brutuality of Leopold's agents, including Henry M.Stanley, who comes across as a vile tyrant. Casement's contribution to exposing the tyranny of Leopold were obscured by disclosure (presumably by Leopold's men) of his closeted homosexuality and by his own misguided allegience to Germany in the First World War.<br />.<br /><br />Just as he was portrayed in \\"The Last Expedition\\", Stanley was a self-created Legend who capitalized on public curiousity over Africa to create his own Empire.<br />Leopold was a skillful lobbyist who enlisted public opinion and powerful allies to perpetuate the  myth of benevolent despotism in the Congo.<br />Just as today, when the World watches benignly while genocide is committed in Rwanda and Sudan, Europe watched while Leopold's henchmen raped the Congo.<br /><br />The Sad part of this excellent history is that, once plundered by the Belgians, the Congo became yet another Prospect for exploitation by the Natives.  Seems you just can't win.<br /><br />Hochschild's research and bibliography are impressive.  Well worth reading.ems you just can't win.     Hochschild's research and bibliography are impressive.  Well worth reading.
B000022TSH|3.0|Apparently this movie is considered by many to be a \\"classic,\\" \\"a masterpiece,\\" and the best noir film of all time.  While this movie has a decent plot and great acting by Jack Nicholson, people tend to get carried away at talking about how great the screenplay is and how great Roman Polanski was in directing this film.  Compared to contemporary noir films such as L.A Confidential and classic noir films like the The Big Sleep, this movie is a little on the slow side and has less action, less violence and overall less suspense.  For a movie to be a fantasic noir film, I would also argue that it has to have great characters other than just the main lead- namely, it has to have a great femme fatale and great dialogue between that person and the lead.  Faye Dunaway was simply alright in this movie.  Compared to Lauren Bacall though, she just doesn't measure up.  After watching this film and then the Big Sleep several times, I would have to say the Big Sleep is the better movie despite its complicated plot.  Just my opinion.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|RHCP has been my favorite band for quite some time now.  I recently was able to attend one of their live concerts and loved every minute of it. It is amazing to not only hear but also watch them perform their songs to perfection. After attending the concert, I found myself wanting to see them perform live again and again.  <br />   One of my friends suggested that I get one of their concert DVDs and I immediately went to Amazon.com to purchase one. I must say that the Live At Slane Castle DVD is one of the best purchases I have every made. It contains over 100 minutes of RHCP doing what they do best. The DVD not only focuses on the band as a whole, but gives direct attention to each of the members as he is doing his thing. They perform so many of my favorite songs. Now, instead of playing the CDs, I just turn up the surround sound on my television and watch it over and over again. Unless you have the money and the means to follow these guys around the world, this is a definite purchase. You won't be disappointed.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I didnt like this movie that much the first time I saw it. It jumped around and seemed to have no story but DVD is the greatest thing to happen to film. Directors cut's like this add so much more insight to the film that studio's wouldn't let in theather reels due to running time. This DVD is Fantastic.
0307237699|5.0|As I read reviews of the book and Obama himself, I think a lot of people are critical of him because he is not a total Democrat and he has nothing new to say.  They say he hasn't enough experience.  Of course he is not seasoned yet-how could he be?  That only comes with age and experience.  But this man, unless he is deceiving us and I don't sense that, has all the goods to be a great public servant.  Look folks, he comes from a mixed background of white, African, and with the Indonesian influence.  We need, need, need people like that who have a varied background to lead us.  The world isn't just white, it isn't just black or just Asian or whatever other group you care to name.  Obama sees the big picture, and that is totally necessary in this world we live in.  Clinton has it; Bush never will because of his narrow background and often narrower heart.  Obama may not say anything new as such, but he is a great thinker who also knows how to compromise and God knows we need more of that.  Does that mean he has no ego?  Of course not, you have to have enough to be a politician and anybody who has a good sense of self will have a good balance of ego and humility.  I think in time we will have more politicians of mixed background, and people similar to him can bring us gifts that we need.  I know too many people who are just either working class or upper middle class or suburban or just whatever, and what they bring is fine, but we need those who have seen the many sides to life.  So, in this life everybody has an opinion.  Mine is, unless something drastic happens that shows great character flaws, that I want this man to be president someday.  We need men and women like this who have a vision, and as important as that, are able to grow in time and to see things as they are.  I believe Obama has the raw gifts to be one of the greats. Time will tell, but I am betting on him to grow and become more visionary as time passes.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Silent Hill is simply great looking and creepy and probably the best movie based on a video game. But still I can't really recommend it. I don't know the game that well and I hear you had to have played the game to understand the movie. But I did watch my brother play the first game once and the film is very faithful to the game.<br /><br />  The foggy look is well done. I don't really know much about the creatures from the game though but here they're more clunky and stupid looking than they are scary. Plus I'm not really sure what the point of them really are.  Radha Mitchell is a good actress but the script baically has it that she sees these creatures...gets scared and when they are gone she just acts casual. Some horror video games tend to be like that though lol. I think she had more to work with in Pitch Black though. She does well in horror films but I'm still not even sure why her or Sean Bean (The Fellowship of the Ring) \\"who plays her husband\\" are this film. Eventhough both are pretty good in it.<br /><br />  She plays a worried mother who's worried about her adopted daughter who has nightmares about a place called Slient Hill. She thinks that bringing her there will help her daughter stop having the nightmares. She gets in an accident after a women police officer trys to make her pull over for like no reason at all. She wakes up in Silent Hill with fog all around her and her daughter nowhere to be seen. She soon realizes that she's in no ordinary place. She has to fight through weird and kinda stupid looking creatures and a crazy cult to try and find her daughter.<br /><br />  I like Alice in Wonderland type stories where people suddenly find themselves in a strange place. I wanted to like this movie for that but it would've been better if it didn't rely on thinking that everyone played the video game. The film is still kinda well made though. I mean I played my share of video games like this and when you reach a certain part towards the end you get a sequence that explains important plot twists. This movie does that when Radha Mitchell gets further to fiding the truth about Silent Hill and I can't really say that part wasn't well done. This is probably the best of the video game movies since it is faithful to the video games. The TombRaider movies would be 4 star caliber if they were faithful to the games. But saying this is the best video game movie is still sad since it's still not a great movie. It's just lightyears better than movies like Doom though.quence that explains important plot twists.

I was surprised that Vin came back at the end. I think one more Fast and the Furious should be made. It should be about Dominic's and Han's time in Mexico. People keep compairing this movie to the first 2. And talking about all the differences (with the cars, ect.) and how they didn't really care for it. What people have to remember is IT WAS MADE BY A DIFFERENT DIRECTOR!
B00004R99F|5.0|The wonderfully hilarious animated film `A Goofy Movie' was released in '95 minus all the fanfare that generally accompanies a Walt Disney Production. It is definitely one of the lesser known amongst all the great Disney features, but it happens to be one of my personal favorites. Join Goofy (a.k.a.: Mr. Goof) and his son Max on their madcap vacation trip as they drive across the country on a father/son bonding venture.<br /><br />Who could ever forget Max's Powerline imitation, Bobby's \\"Tower of Chessa\\", Lester's Possum Park, Bigfoot dancing to \\"Staying Alive\\" or the lovely and demure Roxanne. This little gem of a film is an unforgettable adventure that will be enjoyed by the inner Goofy in all of us.<br /><br />Well constructed storyline, infectious music, lots of funny sequences and quotable lines of dialogue. Buy this one, multiple viewings recommended.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|\\"Babel\\" hooked me right from the begining. The scenes in morroco were very realistic. The director Alejandro Inarritu is vey skilled at drawing you into other cultures. He did a great job at weaving together four different stories. The cinematography was awesome, as was the acting. The film deserved all the oscar nods it received. It would have been nice if Brad Pitt also got one. This is his best performance since \\"Fight Club\\"( a much unappreciated film). I highly reccomend \\"Babel\\".
B000M341QE|4.0|`The Departed' released in '06 is a hard-hitting cops and crooks American version of the wildly successful Chinese film `Infernal Affairs' from '02. Also like the Asian production, this American remake boasts an all-star cast to die for; Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />It's an intense, hard-hitting and bloody drama that starts out like a sure Oscar contender with cutting edge, politically incorrect dialogue delivered in narrative form by Jack Nicholson. I was immediately excited by the prospects ahead and settled in for the gory ride, Good Guys versus Bad Guys, doesn't get any better than that. Unfortunately the storyline slowly begins to lose steam by the midway point of this 2 hour and 32 minute film and despite some brilliant performances, especially DiCaprio and Nicholson, when the conclusion finally arrives you're more than ready for the closing credits to roll by.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing, but not a classic.
0061120081|5.0|I read this book years ago in my highschool freshmon Literature class. it was amazing then and the values held are still held todya. This is one of thoes books that you keep forever becuase it will stay with you that long.
B00004XONN|4.0|i have to say that i like this album, but then again i despise prog rock and i am a big fan of minimalist techno, and i'm also a bit paranoid so i have to say that alot of the music on this album suited me pretty well. \\"idioteque\\" is a great piece of electronic pop music, but is pretty different from the rest of the album. i read some of the negative reviews and i cant say i disagree with alot of it, it is just bleeps and bloops and its very paranoid and depressing but i happen to enjoy this album. this is probably one of the most debated albums since my bloody valentine's Loveless( not to say that this sounds a thing like loveless. i recommend it to fans of minimal synth music and indie rock.
0060977493|5.0|I am an Non-Resident Indian reviewing the novel and I believe the novel draws upon the dark element of discrimination that still dwells in Indian society. Having lived in both India and Singapore, I can really relate to the issues of discrimination that are honestly portraited in this novel. I also loved the poetic language Roy uses to portray her characters and their conflicts. However I have to admit that, at times, the novel becomes a bit draggy; nevertheless it is an amazing depiction of passion and humanity. Thumbs up to Roy.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|mike pattons peeping tom project is an exercise  in pop music with heavy leanings towards trip hop and industrial overtones.<br /><br />the collaborators are game for this and the list  of suspects includes, kool keith, a barely recognizable norah jones, kid koala, doseone and jel of anticon( dose's vocals outdo alot of pattons contributions on his verse for\\"how you feelin\\". the album is a bit cheesy but i got the feeling that it was meant to be a bit of a novelty/party record.  overall this album is far from earthshaking but it definitely works as soundtrack music to a night out.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! The infinifilm version is great too! There are interviews with the actual George Jung and a ton more! Some people don't like it because of the end but I think overall it's an awesome movie especially because it's based on a true story.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I am very happy with the product I purchased through Amazon.  Everything was as reported and shipping dates were accurate.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|We saw all four seasons of Everwood when it was recently shown on ABC Family.  Both my husband and I agreed that it was the most entertaining family drama we had ever seen in forty years of TV watching.  Everwood has everything but violence: comedy, romance, sorrow, joy, confusion, and teen angst.  The writing is imaginative and coherent; we never had a problem following the storyline.  The show is superb, and, unlike many TV series, it remains so to the end of Season 4.  The characters are so real and so likable that you want to invite them to your home for dinner.  Sometimes you want to hug them, and other times you are REALLY disgusted with them, but you never want to turn them off. <br /> <br />We bought the Season 1 DVD set.  It is the only DVD of a TV series that we own.  We would prepay a premium price to own the second, third, and fourth seasons.  They are classics. <br /> <br />If you agree, please write to: <br />Lisa Gregorian  <br />4000 Warner Blvd  <br />Bldg 151 - Rm 223A  <br />Burbank, CA 91521   and/or to <br /> <br />Jeff Brown, Senior Vice President  <br />Warner Home Video  <br />4000 Warner Blvd.  <br />Burbank, CA 91522   and ask them to PLEASE make Seasons 2-4 available on DVD. <br /> <br />Also, if you haven't already, go to the Season 2 entry on amazon.com and sign up to be notified when Season 2 is released.
157912626X|5.0|Great stuff.  Dolly just grows on you....
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Well I've never been a huge fan of Martin Scorcese's films but this one redeemed him in my eyes.  I thought the film was terrific and the acting fantastic.  I couldn't believe the wonderful casting and how each actor was so well suited and superb in their roles.  I was on the edge of my seat all during the movie and there was more than enough action to keep things rolling every minute. <br /> <br />There are very few films which knock my socks off and in 2006 The Departed was the one for me.  In the past, only Crash, Mystic River and Shawshank Redemption (the best film of all) to name a few fit into this genre.  Scorcese should win this one easily but what blows me over is that Leonardo DiCaprio did the best acting performance of his career and he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.  What a joke that is!
0316172324|5.0|Followed up the Tipping Point with this wonderful and thoughtful book.  Read it.
0060245867|5.0|Loved this book as a child! It's a wonderful interaction between a mouse and a little boy. It's not only a great story for your child, but a great way to dialogue about \\"what comes next?\\". Children will be entertained and the ending is sure to bring a smile!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|The product is handy for small jobs and pick ups but the battery has a short life and hard to find and expensive. Follow battery care instructions and before the original dies shop for replacement or buy a new one on sale, which would be cheaper.  The concept is great and wish the materials used were of better quality and the batteries cheaper.
B00000I2UC|3.0|Automatic is probably the last Mary Chain album to put on your shopping list- you certainly shouldn't even think of getting it unless you already have Psychocandy, Darklands, or Stoned and Dethroned.  A fairly predictable set of brainless rock'n'roll cliches set to drum machines, it sounds very much like the band were trying to break into the American market at the time by sugar-coating their gloomy alternative-rock.   The result is a far more palatable album than either Psychocandy or Darklands, but a markedly inferior one- it sounds like Primal Scream and Billy Idol collaborating on a film soundtrack from the early 90s.  Although its a fun listen, its rather formulaic and samey- most of the tracks blend into each other by the end.  As such, its far from an essential purchase.
B00000420F|5.0|Cecilia Bartoli beautifully demonstrates many of the songs in Schirmer's 24 Italian Songs & Arias Of The 17th & 18th Centuries, which is widely recognized as an intermediate collection of Italian repitoire.
0425074811|4.0|Although this book contains great insights about events in history and how they could be linked to higher life forms, it bores you after the first half of the book. all in all. a great read.
B000GY729M|5.0|Sam's Town by The Killers is their best album to date. Why does everybody despise this album so much? It's amazing, catchy, has great hooks, and just pure fun. Standout tracks include: Read My Mind, For Reasons Unknown, This River is Wild, My List, Bling, and Sam's Town. The Killer's style of music is somewhat similar to my other favorite band, Garbage. The music is incredible, Brandon Flowers vocals are spot-on. Give this album a chance and forget what the critcs have said. I highly recommend this masterpiece!
B000002GYI|5.0|I would like to change the stars from 5 to 3, if possible.<br /><br />Some of the songs on this CD are better mixed on the \\"THE MIX\\" cds. Pocket Calculator and Numbers, for example. Same with Computer Love, as it echos with a bad recording (compared to the THE MIX.) But Computer World and Computer World 2 do not appear in other CDs (as far as I know.) Same with Its more fun to compute.  So, you may want consider the CD just for the few differences to their songs.  Better if all songs were original.<br /><br />My suggestion is -- Get the THE MIX cd first.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul by The Beatles is a solid, expectionally beautiful album. This was the first Beatles CD that showed them lyrically and vocally growing as a band. Standout tracks include: I'm Looking Through You, If I Needed Someone, Drive My Car, You Won't See Me, Girl, and Norgweigan Wood (This Bird Has Flown). And then there are songs that no one can resist like Michelle and In my Life, both gorgeous and simple ballads. The Beatles never recorded a song I didn't like, I highly recommend this \\"soul\\" inspired album.  The Beatles are the best band in the world, period!
B000007U6V|5.0|Music by Kraftwerk started with this CD, so one can consider this a core selection.  The MIX is another excellent CD by same group.  What is nice with Kraftwerk music is the tempo or pace of its songs.  For me, this is relaxing yet invigorating.  I suppose the trance music follows the same pattern.  Yet many trance CD are too repetitive.  Kraftwerk has just a little bit of variation here and there, to make the music \\"traveling\\" music.  Autobaun is just that.  18 minutes for just one song.  If you can get into liking this song, you will become a Kraftwerk fan.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver by The Beatles is their most ambitious album up to that point. Just coming fresh off John's Jesus statement, the band decided to just concentrate on making great studio albums instead of touring the world like crazy. To me, Revolver is their masterpiece. My favorite album from the Fab Four is Abbey Road but Revolver is their most consistent record from that period. Standout tracks include: Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, Love You To, Yellow Submarine, I Want to Tell You, For No One, and Tomorrow Never Knows. John and George seem to have the stronger songs here, the track, She Said She Said is highly intelligent with John breaking your heart with the lyric, \\"And you're making me feel like I've never been born...\\"  I highly recommend this wonderful album.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|Not all Kraftwerk albums are worthy of purchase, but this one is.  Careful when a CD has multiple songs with same title.  That usually means the creativity has given way to duplication. Not here.  So, this should be added to your colletion.
0312335164|5.0|Dan Brown is one of the beast authors. His main strenght is in his writing- he captivates the reader who in turn cannot put the book down. <br />In this particular book technology and the US secret services are main factors. Brown has doen, as with his are books done a lot of research andprovides the reader not only an entertaining read but some intersting info. <br />The only drawback of this book is that it has not reached the climax of Da Vinci Code but, again,that book is his masterpiece. This one still deserves five stars. Enjoy it.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|The important contribution of John Reed to the revolutionary movement here in America before World War I and later during the Russian revolution and its aftermath has never been fully appreciated. His reportage of the Russian Revolution gathered in Ten Days That Shook The World is a classic of journalistic coverage. Thus, Warren Beatty, whatever his personal motives, has done a great service in filming the life of this \\"traitor to his class\\" (and his Harvard Class of 1910) and partisan of the international working class.    As usual with such commercial enterprises the order of things gets switched in the wrong direction. The love affair between Reed (played by Beatty) and budding writer and early feminist Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) (and a little third party intervention by the playwright Eugene O'Neill, played by Jack Nicholson) is set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution not the other way around, but such is cinematic license. More than most film depictions this one mainly gets the story straight; the early radical free lance journalist who wins his spurs covering the Mexican Revolution; the bohemian Greenwich Village life including its socialite partrons like Mabel Dodge; the socialist fight against American participation in World War I; the turmoil in socialist (and anarchist) ranks over support to the Russian Revolution; and, an interesting segment on the seemingly incomprehensible in-fighting in the early communist movement between the foreign-language federations and the Reed-led American-born \\"Natives\\". Those 'natives', like James Cannon, Earl Browder and Willaim Z. Foster in the course of events would form the leadership of the party through most of the twenties when the cadre still wanted to make a revolution here and not just cheer on the Russian Revolution from afar. A nice touch in the film is the interspersing of commentaries by those, friend and foe, who knew or knew of Reed or were around during this time. See this movie
B000ICL3KG|5.0|When the video started, I thought to myself, \\"Am I going to have to watch Al Gore do a lecture through this entire movie?\\" Wow was I wrong. A lot of it was tapes of his lectures but so interestingly done, I forgot that I wasn't going to like it.  <br />What breaks my heart is that we have been hearing this message since the 70s and, as a country, we have not been listening.
0743289412|1.0|I would think the man who wrote THE SHINING and THE STAND would be ashamed to use phrases such as \\"Shut the smuck up\\" and \\"all the bad-gucky.\\"  When did Stephen King get cutesy? <br /> <br />Like many of his fans, I adore the early King works.  He is one of the best writers ever--for me not because of his penchant for horror but because of his canny grasp of human psychology.  He's been one of my gods for a long time.  Which makes it all the more sad to see him stooping to this drool.  I agree with the reviewer who said King should heed his own excellent advice from ON WRITING and cut out the bad-gucky stuff.  Come on, Mr. King.  Please. <br />
B000NA28IE|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the series, Inheiretance. Look people anyone knows that if you loved the book you will not like the movie! I'm telling you people, you will not like this movie if you're a fan of the book, Eragon. I have to admit that they did Saphira well, they could've have done a tad better but that's hollywood.  <br /> <br />This is just a warning for all those fans of the book that got severely dissapointed or who didn't see it. If you're a fan of the book then you're wasting your money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like most I was skeptical. People recommended it and I wouldn't budge, had to discover it on my own, you see. Never could get into Buffy and definitely not Angel, but Firefly? Firefly was special.  <br /> <br />I saw Serenity and loved the rich dialogue, the set design, the acting and everything in between. Obviously the next step would be to pick up Firefly, right? I made my boyfriend rent the discs sporadically from Netflix. I'd watch each disc in a sitting or two and be fanatically involved for days.  <br /> <br />I've finished all the discs and I can honestly say I cried... more than once. This show is what I'll watch if I'm in a bad mood and I can never, ever get enough of it.  <br /> <br />I don't know what Fox was thinking when they cancelled this show, they never even gave it a chance. I saw the airing order and wow, they aired it completely OUT of order and they didn't even show the pilot until AFTER they cancelled it. I don't get it.  <br /> <br />I'm pretty sure Joss Whedon won't be reprising the story of Firefly and that's okay because what is available is so perfect. <br /> <br />I'd recommend it to anyone with half a brain. Seriously.
0800177975|5.0|Arnold is the world's greatest actor.  If there was justice in the world, he would be given the Oscar every year.  I actually moved to California, so that Arnold would be my governor.  Last year, I voted for him twice.  This is his finest film.  Note the superb cinematography and witty repartee.  I heart Ahnold.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|best and most beautful voices, I have in a long long long time!
6305558167|5.0|I always loved this legend, and the acting of everyone involved in the movie is excellent.
0066620996|5.0|This is one of the best, fact filled, business books I've ever read. I highly recommend this book.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|This cut is a huge improvement over the original theatrical release. As stated above it is 30 minutes longer and rated R. Daredevil was always a darker character that could be more fleshed out in an R rated flick.  The fight scene in the bar/poolhall is extended. There is a subplot added in involving Matt, Foggy, and one of their clients played by Collio of all people. This subplot ties into the overall plot of the movie. The corny love scene between Matt and Elektra has been taken out. This is almost an entirely different movie.  If the studio had released this version to begin with perhaps critics would have been kinder to this film. If you like comic book movies than this is a must own.
0875847706|4.0|Family therapist Rosamund Stone Zander and symphony conductor Benjamin Zander offer 12 practices for learning to take on an attitude of abundance and possibility. You will enjoy Benjamin Zander's charming anecdotes from his experiences as a distinguished orchestra conductor, as well as the philosophy of family therapist Rosamund Stone Zander whose professional background gives her a deeply insightful viewpoint. Indeed, some of the Zanders' stories are so striking that they will stay with you long after you put the book down. We recommend this book to people who like to explore self-development, story lovers, music aficionados, anyone who has taken on a big commitment and other creative types who will savor the authors' unusual frame of reference.
4789009637|4.0|Genki: an intergrated course, was the text I learned to speak Japanese from in college.  It was also the text I gave to my brother, who is learning Japanese now on his own.  This book lays a solid foundation for grammar, vocab, and kanji, all while providing nice cultural notes, and fairly entertaining \\"plot,\\" and a nice transition to informal and formal speech, allowing a greater mastery.  This approach also helps one to read manga or watch japanese foriegn films immensely. <br /> <br />My only drawback is it is increasingly hard to find the workbook and companion volume, Genki II, these days.
0753820250|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind was brilliant. Amazing writing.  MAJOR surprises that come out of nowhere (which I love, especially when I can later see the cleverly hidden foreshadowing).  No long-winded speeches that should've been cut.  Nothing at all I can criticize, in fact.<br /><br />The protagonist is an Everyman whose journey had me captivated from the start as he finds a whale of a mystery surrounding his favorite book and author.  The surprises are brilliantly inserted, the descriptions are incredibly tangible, and the characters are all uniquely and realistically flawed.<br /><br />Amazing writing.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD has great music that brings back sooooo many memories.  A must buy!!!
B000002KJQ|3.0|Well I'm glad that by reading just a few other reviews that most people share my sentiments about this re-release. I took this out of the library to throw in my car to listen to, I used to have this cassette when I was in high school and always loved this album. It really is one of their best. But as soon as Waiting for the Bus begins you notice the horrible over produced drum sound. I was repulsed (I'm a drummer and always hated the slick over produced and ultimately unnatural drum sound, even back when it was the popular way to produce back in the '80s) and immediately began going to the next track hoping this bad dream would end and I would hear the inviting, dry natural sound of the origional. Of course I was wrong. I can't even listen to this album all butchered like this. I never knew they redid this whole album, I knew I would hear 2 versions of La Grange but I didn't know they butchered whole albums. I hope they regret it now in retrospect. Remember all the drum machine parts in the album after Eliminator? The writing was on the wall.
0975991477|5.0|As a medical doctor, I am thrilled to read Dr Lipton's book. His ability to simplify complicated science is remarkable. He verbilizes concepts I have intuitively known. After 20 years of medical practice, I plan to change vocations. I am unable to remain in a system that takes healing power from the individual and forces doctors to play insurance games with people's lives.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie, Equilibrium directed by Kirt Wimmer (Ultraviolet) is one of the most overlooked and forgoten gems of cinema in almost a decade! Amagine a world without emotion. There is no war, no hate, no envy, or crime. A perfect world? There is also no human being that can emote, feel, love, care, or empathize with thier fellow man. The cause of this... a drug that soceity takes daily to keep thier emotions at bay. This is the story of one man's awakening to emotion and love and about how he fights back against a system that keeps humanity under it's control by taking away what it truely means to be human. The story is epic in its scope and scale. The acting is beyond great. The action in mind blowing and intense. The star of this film is Christian Bale who would become the future of the Batman movies in C. Nolan's Batman Begins.
0440237688|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" is a story set in an ideal, almost vacuum-like community at an undetermined time. The community is stuctured under the idea of \\"sameness\\". There is no deviation from the normal values and regualtions, there is not even a change in elevation. Despite the foriegn setting, the messages about free will and problems in changing the status quo of society remain familiar. <br /> <br />I feel this book is extremely original and thought-provoking. While it contains controversial issues, it is a story. It is something that will bring up issues, but no one will be enraged at the story, only captivated with the ideas. I rated a 4 out of 5 because it is sort of simply written, even though it is  mature for its size and what would be expected from the simple writing style. The writing doesn't talk in circles or flourishes, it lets the story speak for itself.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|This is one jaw-dropper of a DVD! Joe is on fire! His shows his versatility in his amazing ability, what with Yes covers, SRV-style blues covers, Eric Sardinas-style electric Dobro...great playing and GREAT TONE! His guitar tone itself is jaw-dropping. His bassist and drummer are as tight as wallpaper on a wall. And the overall sound quality is TOP NOTCH. Best concert DVD of the year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00008VGK0|5.0|I must say I am thoroughly impressed with this maxi single.  Most of the 'hip' remix producers from 2003 and on I will say are becoming too similiar in style and production technique, but this maxi single completely reigns the producers in individualism and distinction.  The inspiration?  Maybe it's the song itself.  Maybe it's Madonna.  I'm not sure, but this release is certainly worth the purchase. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the surprising opener, produced and featuring Missy Elliott.  The original material is given a complete makeover, changing the feel of the song slightly changing the message.  The original track, upbeat and in your face, somehow echos a feeling of loneliness; yet this remix doesn't echo that.  The addition of Missy Elliott altogether brings an all-together different feeling - Madonna isn't the only one.  It's become a \\"we\\" vibe. <br /> <br />The Oakenfold Remix is perhaps my favorite of the single.  It's just complete club worthy!  The verses are slick and clean and smart - and the way the vocals and synths of the chorus echo adds a new strength not found in the original production.  Wow, mate.  Check this one out. <br /> <br />The Felix da Housecat remix is a dark, electro journey in the search for contentment in an techno-driven modern world.  The track is a great dance tune, though I wasn't too crazy about the closing sequence.  Still worth a listen. <br /> <br />The complete Peter Rauhofer two-parter is included on the collection as well, combined together would be about 20 minutes.  I wasn't impressed by Part 1 nor Part 2. <br /> <br />However, the compilation closer \\"Die Another Day\\" remix by Humpty by far makes up for the lackluster Peter Rauhofer mixes.  This one is pure dance club, and even if you're at work, you'll find yourself standing up dancing the time away.  Truly a wonderful remix.
B000LC3ID8|2.0|I was disapointed in this movie. I had to make myself stay with it. My husband watched about 30 mins of it and then left the room. It did not live up to Saw I and II, which I liked very much. I think there will be a IV and I will watch it.
B000H305U0|1.0|This guy is a joke! The harder he trys to be \\"soulful\\" the more laughable he becomes. He's not bringing sexy back (he did bring my lunch back up). He looks like Baby New Year,but he wants to be Stevie Wonder. Ha!
0060977493|5.0|I started this novel five or six years ago but found it too confusing so put it down.  However, this time I found it mesmerizing and could not put it down, racing from chapter to chapter, totally caught in the mystique through which Roy masterfully unwraps her characters.  Such a powerful new descriptive, totally \\"of the moment\\" writing.  It was sad yet revealing of the way times, events and circumstances wrest control from those caught in their web.  The feeling it leaves with me is akin to how I felt after seeing \\"Sophie's Choice\\" - haunted by the unfairness of the story itself, yet enriched from the unique gifts of the storyteller.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I have just recieved my DVD that augments the CD I also purchased. I am just thrilled with this collection of Celtic Woman - A New Journey. I feel like my soul has been uplifted to again be enchanted with such music deeply intrenched with richness and heritage while performed by just simply a spectacular group of vocalists and muscicians.<br /><br />My stereo TV was pushed to its limits as I enjoyed this magical performance<br /><br />In a day when so much music is so de sensistised, I am very warmed that yes, we can still create such emotion and beauty.<br /><br />Thank you Celtic Woman, you have brought a little light back to this troubled soul.
B000002UWF|5.0|Amazing CD- excellent arrangements performed by a master musician and showman- his songs still work today - most recently in a GAP TV commercial. <br /> <br />Especially like Just a Gigolo and That Old Black Magic which are classics. <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|This book reminds me of Louise Haye, who duped AIDS patients into believing they could think good thoughts and survive AIDS.  She had people \\"thanking the virus, thanking your toilet \\". It didn't work and many died.<br /><br />Also, if you're an atheist like me, you'll find this book difficult to read.<br /><br />My opinion = We can't change everything with our thoughts.  Look how many prayer vigils and memorials are made for missing children, only to find the poor child is dead. What happened to the good thoughts & energy?<br /><br />In my opinion we all know, by intuition, what we need to be happy.<br /><br />Give the cash for this book to a homeless person - you'll both be happier.
B00004YRQA|1.0|How does Sony even justify that thes 8MB memory cards are still $20?!?! Thats the equivalent of storing 2 mp3 songs!!! Just look on this website for flash memory and you'll see that you can get a WHOLE GIGABYTE of data storage, even 2GB if you look. 8MB is still just one step above floppys. Talk about price control and screwwing the consumer! And you can't even use these things anywhere else. At least with the PS3 you can use other media (and over 8MB).
B000ETQRCM|4.0|What more needs to be said? whether or not you been a fan since their early days or just hearing about them for the first time, this album won't let you down. Unlike Binural and Riot Act this album is much or alive and full of energy, I can't complain too much about this one, Big Wave is nothing more than a filler and Come Back is also skippable. Other than that the songs are great, Inside Job being the most amazing one.
0399226907|5.0|I love reading this book to my baby.  There is more than one lesson to be learned in the story, and the illustrations are beautiful.  It's also sturdy.  I previously purchased a hard cover minibook by accident (I thought it was the board book) and it was flimsy and too small to really get the full effect.  The board book is good for all ages.
B000244FDW|1.0|I confess I love watching BBC productions, in fact I'm a huge fan, but BBC's 1985 version of Pride and Prejudice is quite honestly the worst BBC production I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them.<br /><br />What seems to be wrong you ask??<br /><br />Well simply put it really isn't consistant with the book and the characters and settings seem off.  But yes it is still in England and yes there are the same main characters BUUUTT that's pretty much all I can tell from watching it.<br /><br />THe MAIN Characters:<br /><br />Well let's see, the main hero and THE greatest man in classical literature, Mr. Darcy<br /><br />........ Mr. Darcy well he's handsome alright but nothing like a Mr. Darcy should be.  This Mr. Darcy is unemotional and just seems like a stuck up jerk, he doesn't seem shy or bored with society but simply dull and well, I absolutely hate him as a person.<br /><br />**Sulking is not acting, I sulk everyday and I've never won an Oscar.**<br /><br />Elizabeth was alright, I thought she was cute and clever, but not exactly what you would want as an Elizabeth.  I did like her though.<br /><br />I do have one question...<br /><br />WHO wrote this sad sad script???? and why was Elizabeth, after Darcy proposed, smiling and quirky??? this jerk just asked her to marry her against his better thoughts and wishes and COMPLETELY dissed her family and called them idiots... yep i would really act like that in that situation... she obviously needs a life coach<br /><br />another thing, after Darcy gives Elizabeth the letter explaining everything the camera is watching Darcy walk away... this actor... (sorry to say) can't walk.. it's like watching a scowling, stomping duck waddle away. (huh?)<br /><br />in conclusion (if you couldn't tell):<br /><br />I was very disappointed... the production seemed cheap and the acting very very poor.  You may think from the other reviews that it is worth watching but honestly it is not!<br /><br />I know that BBC made better movies in the 80's than this.  I just know that they did.<br /><br />I wish I never bought it and I wish I never saw it, I wish I could throw it away, but that would be a waste of my hard earned money.<br /><br />GOOD GOD, it's that aweful.<br /><br />Thank you for listening,<br /><br />Just so you know I'm obsessed with Pride and Prejudice so I do know a little something.<br /><br />*********************************<br /><br />PS<br /><br />By FL's LOVELY Daughter... but, yep, FL does agree with me.better movies in the 80's than this.  I just know that they did. <br /> <br />I wish I never bought it and I wish I never saw it, I wish I could throw it away, but that would be a waste of my hard earned money.  <br />GOOD GOD, it's that aweful.  <br /> <br />Thank you for listening,  <br />Just so you know I'm obsessed with Pride and Prejudice so I do know a little something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />********************************* <br />PS <br />By FL's LOVELY Daughter... but, yep, FL does agree with me.

I LOVE this album, there is not a single track that I dislike at all! If you are already a daft punk fan there is no reason why you wouldn't love it! I don't think it is cold at all; actually it is sweet, I think, and it makes for good make out music!! I don't listen to that traditional corny BS! Me and my fiance LOVE daft punk and we love all of their music and this album is no exception!

630521610X|4.0|I was one of the fortunate to view all three flicks at the cinema. This is definitely the best one of them all. There is just one issue that this DVD is lacking from the rest: WHY ISN'T THIS DVD ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN PRESENTATIONS ON 16:9 TELEVISIONS LIKE THE OTHER ONES ARE?
B000MNP2KI|2.0|As I was watching \\"Casino Royale,\\" I kept saying to myself \\"This would make an interesting James Bond film.\\"  I say this because the film did not seem like a James Bond film.  All the normal conventions were missing: no issue of the call from M, no Q, no Miss Moneypenny.  I'm not sure how they could even call this a Bond film.<br /><br />I think they were self-aware of the reboot, so they overcompensated by trying to too hard to make it a Bond film--the gunbarrel, the exquisite opening credits, retro swimsuit, the two Aston Martins, one a retro-Bond, the martini joke, the tux, and the self-aware Ms. Broadchest.  However, they merely depicted the external Bond. So what we saw were merely recycled props.  This is an action spy thriller, not Sotheby's.<br /><br />And then there's the plot.  Plot is usually defined as a story's meaningful series of events. We got the series of events, but there was no meaning to them. It seemed like splice job of well-choreographed actions and romance scenes.  The plot twists jerked in large clumps.  But I was not sure where I was going in the film--once again, this did not follow the pattern of the first 21 Bond films.<br /><br />And then there were the thick accents of the two leads. They sounded very romantic, but only Rupert Giles could understand them. Furthermore, you had the odd attempts at making Bond more human, with cockiness covering self doubt with a dash of angst--is this Bond or Bourne?. And mercy! to have Bond screaming under torture! After to years with the Chinese, Bauer kept his peace.  Sigh!<br /><br />As a consolation prize, I have seen that they have begun to reprint Fleming's clasics--albeit with rather racy covers.  Maybe I can find some good memories in the original sources.
B0000C1HLF|5.0|It makes Citizen Kane look amateurish. The finest most profound film of our time. \\"Proof\\" that TV writers are our greatest artistes.
0743454537|2.0|This book was OK.  I agree with much of what was said about it already by other readers.  The constant change of perspective (from Anna, to Sara, to Brian, etc.), was a little disorienting.  The mother was kind of a flat figure - there wasn't enough emotional complexity to her to really understand someone like that.  Not sure why the lawyer and the GAL had to get it on.<br /><br />That said, there was a lot to recommend this book.  I was captivated by the portrayal of both girls.  The dad was so real, I could almost see him.  The way the story wove the characters together, and got them to open up to each other, and finally to themselves, was satisfying.<br /><br />but....<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT******<br /><br />The ending ruined the book!  What a cop out!  It was as if the author still truly thought that Anna made the wrong decision, or she couldn't just let Kate die and leave Anna to deal with the guilt.  She had to use this convenient plot twist (a deus ex machina if there ever was one) just to make the dilemma disappear.  I'm sure it was supposed to be this neat ironic twist, but I think it completely vitiated any moral lesson or broader message to be drawn from the book.
B00009W0WM|5.0|What more can you ask for in a film.  Instant classic.  One of the best assembled casts in movie history.  I can watch this movie over and over.  It would be a sin to colorize this film, for I believe it would take everything away from it, everything.  And if there should be a colorized version of it somewhere, I will not even attempt to watch.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|With so many tracks, spanning both the first and second seasons of the NEW Doctor Who series, this American listener found this soundtrack very satisfying, because it captures all those highlights and moods I loved so much from the show. All those little songs moments that you wished you could hear more of. I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoyed the show.
0783230079|5.0|One of my wife's favorite movies and now on DVD! Puts a smile on her face and lifts her spirit every time she watches it. It's the first DVD she lends out when someone needs a care package.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|For anyone who has even a vague understanding of the concept of \\"synchronicity\\" and all its permutations, this is a great movie.  It's in the vein of \\"Magnolia\\" and a few other movies that explore how peoples' lives are interconnected. <br /> <br />While the plot here, without revealing it, may be a little far fetched, the movie beautifully illustrates what some people feel a lot more than others, about the hidden forces in our lives. <br /> <br />If you've ever met someone by chance and wondered if you'd known them at another time, or, if you've ever felt like maybe you've experienced something at a different time, yet you simultaneously realize that's impossible, then you'll really enjoy this film. <br /> <br />Will Ferrell is mostly known as a comedian.  Sometimes, that's true for Dustin Hoffman as well, but in this movie, they both play quite serious characters. Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhall are just icing on the cake, and turn in great performances in their own right. <br /> <br />Some have described this movie as a romantic comedy.  Nothing could be further from the truth. It's the type of film that will resonate for years, and is destined to become an all time classic.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I loved Firefly, but I found this movie to be quite disappointing. It was definitely weaker than any of the episodes from the series.

B000E33VWW|4.0|vant & celebrity writer in New York City. Not a biography, but the story of his sometimes tortuous journey writing his masterpiece, \\"In Cold Blood.\\" It started as an article for the New Yorker then he decided to make it a book. It concerns the murder of an entire farm family in Kansas. The killers are arrested, & in fairly short order are sentenced to death. Phillip Seymour won the academy award & is dead on. He looks like Capote & even has his mannerisms & speech patterns down. The book took over Capote's life with brief interuptions for several years. He met many rural folks from the area & develops close relationships in the course of his research, including with the condemned men. His repugnance to the death penalty puts him at odds with the local people & his own best interest. He helps the men postpone their execution. He could not finish his book until they die. At some point, he ceases to help them, perhaps feeling he is being used or realizing the condemned start to believe they will not be hanged. They are of course & Capote never finishes another book. An excellent film & deserving of it's awards.
B000L45YEW|4.0|If you're expecting tons of fights and crazy stunts then you probably won't like this movie.  It's toned down alot compared to his movies from the 80's and 90's and there is some noticable wire-work (which is common in alot of his new movies) but he is getting up there, pushing 53.  I think he's earned the right to use wires because alot of the stuff that's done with the wires is stuff that he could have easily done when he was younger and less-injuried. <br />Anyways, the movie itself is very refreshing compared to hollywood movies which populate north america.  I know that the whole \\"men taking care of baby\\"  act has been done before and I'm sure you're thinking this is just another one of those movies, but I was surprised to find that it isn't.  It's unique and the story has surprising depth to it.  The advertising for this movie is kind of misleading with the baby dressed up in different outfits and styles for the cute factor but in reality the movie isn't as crazy as the cover art and posters portray it to be. It is a more of an upbeat movie, but it isn't over the top silly.   <br />The movie has a bunch of emotional scenes that I thought, made the movie stand out from the average baby-comedies out there.  <br />It's a long movie (the extended cut at 2 hours and 15 minutes) but it didn't really seem to drag on at all. I'd recommend this to any Jackie Chan fan that isn't expecting insane action from his past, but don't worry there are a few fight scenes and stunts to satisfy.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is an excellent television series, and it stands out strongest in its first season, collected here on DVD.  The season tracks Veronica's investigation of the murder of her best friend, Lily Kane, as she also delves into major sub-mysteries revolving around her runaway mother, her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, her paternity, and the identity of her rapist, all of which are smoothly advanced as Veronica deals with a much smaller mystery for a friend or client each episode.  Rob Thomas' stories effortlessly pace the development of all mysteries big and small; the weekly mysteries are typically light and relatively simple, the larger mysteries are intriguing and surprising, and the search for Lily's killer is exciting all the way up until its heart-stopping revelation and conclusion.  The show constantly defies expectations, as there are enough plausible explanations for the events in Neptune to keep even the best amateur sleuth in suspense.  Whether you love mystery, humor, relationship drama, or just a hot blond girl in a short skirt, one thing's for sure: Veronica Mars won't let you down.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|ENGLISH PATIENT is a classic. The Collector's Edition includes in-depth interviews from the director, film editor, and some cast members. These extras heightened my enjoyment of a truly  stirring movie.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|I've watched this version ten times in the last 30 days, and compared to the \\"uplifting\\" movie edited by the non-artistic producers, i can only say that if you really want to be immersed in the dark cyberpunk world proposed by Phillip Dick and his visionary mind, this is the version. Voice-over made Deckard look funny, like a new Indiana Jones. I think it's not Dick's or Scott's intention at all!!
B00005CDNI|5.0|Being primarily a lover/collector of heavy metal, hard and progressive rock music, how can I explain why I still have a soft spot for this Swedish music machine. First of all I can say that ABBA was a big part of the music I grew up on. I especially remember being fascinated by the constant presence of the song 'Chiquitita' (among others) pouring out of the radio as well as from stereo and music shop speakers in the late 70's/early 80's. As a 12-year old kid, I amassed most of their albums on cassette before discovering more serious media such as vinyl and eventually CD's. Now when I listen to their output on CD with a more mature mind it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. I would say their most mature, consistent and standout album would be 'Voulez-Vous'. From the opening reverbed vocal onslaught on `As Good As New' to the powerful controlled screams on `Lovers (live a little longer)' it does not disappoint. Agnetha's and Anni-Frid's stirring and exquisite vocal harmonies are at their finest. After a typical listen to this album, every one of the tunes on this recording reverberates in my head constantly. Although the songs that went on to be hits (`Chiquitita', `Angel Eyes', `Does Your Mother Know') are top-notch, the remaining tracks such as `If It Wasn't For The Nights, `Lovers...', `The King Has Lost His Crown' etc. are just as good if not better. Without going into in-depth analysis of each song, I would say that IMHO, every single song on this album is memorable and extremely catchy. Whether you consider Voulez-Vous as influenced mainly by disco, funk, or whatever, it doesn't matter. Even though it is a bit dancey, the bottom line is that it's just plain brilliant music!. (interestingly enough I actually consider many 'disco' songs of that era to be of much higher musical quality than a lot the latest rock/pop crap being 'manufactured' today). The bonus tracks, `Gimme Gimme Gimme', `Summer Night City' and `Lovelight' are an especially nice addition to the remastered version (the first two I remember hearing on a long gone cassette copy of `Greatest Hits Vol.2' I had back in the day). If you dig ABBA for whatever reason (don't be ashamed to admit it!) you will not be disappointed by this album, especially the remastered version.
B00005JM8V|1.0|Of the five DVD's in the set, all five were defective.  Two had video dropouts through much of the disk, and the remainder would show some problems and then skip over large parts of the program.  They had to be returned as defective.  This happened on two good DVD players.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I loved this movie. Of course I love all the HP movies, and I have read the books as soon as they have come out since the 3rd one. The cast was excellent, and they captured the essence of the book. What else is there to say? If you've seen the first two, plan to see this one as well.
0143034901|5.0|Most literary mysteries have disappointed me.  Usually its the ending that leaves me wanting.  So many authors possess the creative gifts of plot and character development but have no idea how to wrap up a tale in a satisfying way.  Stephen King is a prime offender and \\"King\\" of the contrived conclusion so I assumed the risk when I bought \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" bearing King's recommendation on the cover.<br /><br />For some reason I love the genre but the specific books I have read have let me down.  Not this one.  Even though I nailed the key surprise a 100 or so pages before the end, there were plenty of other surprises waiting for me.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
0312330537|5.0|A Great Book... Gregory David Roberts really has a knack of writing. He does a phenomenal job of bringing the characters to life and gets the reader involved into the story.

0780624890|5.0|You don't even have to like comic books to enjoy Blade, featuring Wesley Snipes!  The first 10 minutes are more action packed than other blockbusters like Bad Boys, and that is partly what makes this movie a huge success.<br /><br />After watching this movie again today, it struck me how many other action movies of that time period (late 90's) copy from Blade.  There is a scene where Snipes meets Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) in a park and Frost dodges bullets from Snipes assault weapon.  Does the Matrix ring a bell?<br /><br />Other than X-Men 2 & Spider Man 2, this is my favorite Marvel Comics movie adaptation!  For every succesful film, seems like there are 3 or 4 duds from Marvel ie, Daredevil, Fantastic 4, Punisher, The Avengers, Ghost Rider, for example.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Wesley Snipes since Major League and he brings Blade, slicing to life!
B000LC3ID8|4.0|This movie was definately one of the best.  It is in close competition with the second movie.  A must see if you love Saw!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|What I particularly like about this television adaptation is its representation of just how QUIET and sedate life was like in the centuries before our own clamorous age.  Surely our ancestors would be horrified by the sheer pace and the cacophony of modern life in the twenty-first century.   <br />I can vividly remember visiting my ancient grandparents, - who had my father rather late in their lives, - in their sitting room.  They were both Victorians by birth and temperament. My grandpa reading his newspaper and puffing on his pipe.  My grandma lost in her needlepoint.  The silence of their shared idyll disturbed only by the soft ticking of the clock on the mantle, shattering the quietude by chiming its reminder on the hour.  My boisterous presence interrupting their quiet contentment: the murmured conversation between them both and the cheery talk with welcome visitors.  The soft, hushed colours in the subdued lighting...  A veritable recreation of bygone times and values.  All reproduced here in this wonderful film. <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|What do you get when you put a divorcee (Toni Collette), a suicidal brother (Steve Carell), a drug addict senior (Alan Arkin), a life coach (Greg Kinnear), a teenager with a vow of silence (Paul Dano) and an adorable six year pageant finalist (Abigail Breslin) into a yellow Volkswagen bus? Well, I'll tell you. You get a roller coaster ride of emotion<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is about a middle class family, struggling to get by and struggling to keep the pieces of their dysfunctional family together. This is put to an even greater test when they pack up the bus to travel to California so the youngest, little Olive, can compete in a beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this film and plan to watch it again and again. I laughed really hard and cried numerous times. I'm not a big fan of Steve Carell (40 year old virgin, The Office) but I loved him in this film. Olive first won my heart in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs and again in Raising Helen. All the actors young and old were superb and harmonized one another.<br /><br />Some may not think the story line is original--family forced to travel together-- but this really is a dynamic group of actors providing quality entertainment from beginning to end. It has some dark subject matter at times; dealing with issues of depression, suicide, drug abuse, unemployment, and death but most are handled with the utmost respect. I said most.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet, hysterical and sad film. I highly recommend seeing it.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|the cd is great. absolutely love it. i advise anyone who likes rock music in general to at least listen to the sample clips.
B000069HK2|5.0|If you have to get any album by the Used or any band really, get this one. Each song is amazing in it's own right. Plus Branden (who is now the drummer of Rancid, if that says how amazing he is) is one of the most insane drummers ever. This record is a mixture of heartfelt screaming, beautiful lyrics, beautiful melodies, intense drums, insane bass lines, genius guitar riffs and a variety of songs from an acoustic to poppy to screaming.
0812550706|5.0|This book is the beginning of an incredible book series.  I highly recommend everyone reads at least this book.  Ender is brought into a life he doesn't want, and over the course of his force fed life, you (as a reader) will learn how to become a leader.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I have to say I liked about half of this movie. The Japanese deaf mute story was a bit much however, in a word pointless. I'm glad I rented it and didn't see it in the theaters, at least on dvd I could ff all the parts that just dragged on and on and on. I found the the story that revolved around Morocco and Mexico very interesting, but they could have excluded the whole Japanese story completely as far as I'm concerned. Just when things got interesting in Morocco it cut to Japan and I kept thinking come on get on with it. The Mexican party scene also dragged on way too long. The movie had a nasty habbit of getting me interested and then a minute later boring the holy hell out of me. I give it two stars because two out of the three stories were interesting. It reminded me of Thin Red Line, a bit too bold for its own good and yet parts did manage to impress me.
1400062756|3.0|I'll begin with a summary which allows you, dear reader, to decide if you should read any more of this review: <br /> <br />The irony of Dweck's book is that if the reader understands and believes what she's saying, then after the first chapter that reader has no reason to keep reading. <br /> <br />And now, the long (Dweck) version. I was first made aware of this book and its ideas in a seminar on motivating students about a month and a half ago. As presented in the seminar, these seemed like great ideas: intelligence is not fixed, it is learnable, changeable, even teachable. Asking the right questions and making the right comments in the classroom can change the way students approach learning and thinking, and encourage them to grow and learn much more than one might expect. Fantastic. The approach seemed sensible, the logic intuitive, the results believable. I adapted some of the material for a class and sought out the book. <br /> <br />It seemed odd when I found the book on the library shelf not with psychological or pedagogical research, but near books of self-help and affirmation, such as Julia Cameron's `The Artists's Way.' Ah, I thought, it's just a categorization issue. Not something to worry about. But I should've worried, as I'll explain shortly. <br /> <br />Returning to Dweck, I found the ideas she presents - or rather, singular \\"idea,\\" since there really isn't more than one - to be quite interesting, as I'd hoped. Unfortunately, the book itself isn't. As I said earlier, reading a single chapter gets the point across: intelligence is not fixed, it can be changed. It is only our \\"mindset\\" that holds us back. If we believe we can't learn, if we believe our abilities are restricted, then they will be. Our limitations are learned and set by ourselves. If we think we can improve ourselves, we will. If we insist that we're unable to achieve, we won't. (Dweck offers a few hasty caveats to prevent readers from believing they can will themselves to do absolutely anything, but always as afterthoughts.) <br /> <br />That's it. That's the core and kernel of the book, summarized in my few weak sentences. While it was only natural of Dweck to take more space than this, there are limits. Frankly, the main argument of the book could have been made convincingly in a twenty page pamphlet. With a thoughtful design and organization, perhaps a very readable, informative, and even inspirational, tome of 150 or so pages. But certainly not as the rambling, repetitive 288-page critter as this book now exists. <br /> <br />As I read the first three chapters of this book (and, in full disclosure, that is as far as I got, about one-third through), several things became clear to me. Besides the dearth of ideas - how far can one stretch this simple thought? - I began to understand why \\"Mindset\\" was categorized in the self-help section and not placed with more scholarly work. For one thing, there is little of scholarly weight here. Dweck frequently refers to studies and research, but most of this is not available to the interested reader. The endnotes are strangely non-standard, making it difficult to identify sources, let alone locate them. Much of the evidence cited appears to be unpublished and unvetted research by Dweck and her colleagues (or students). Several searches on Dweck and her co-researchers turned up nothing. The general bibliography, while something to go on, is also very thin. Dweck herself appears to have the credibility and scholarly bona fides one might expect from a PhD working at Columbia, but they are not in evidence here. <br /> <br />In addition, the format of the chapters was disappointing. It revealed why the book belongs in the self-help section. Each chapter consists of a mixture of assertions and affirmations from the author, impressive-sounding but undocumented research, and effusive testimonials - I can think of no other word to use - by students and others whose lives have been changed by Dweck's idea. As a motivational tract, it works. As a scholarly work, to be taken seriously, to offer up convincing and repeatable proof of its ideas, it falls short. It is reasonably well-written, it is entertaining (numbing repetition aside), it is provocative and confident. As a useful piece of research, it disappoints. <br /> <br />As I've stated more than once, the idea of this book is excellent. It is the execution of which I am critical. I look forward to a future volume by Dweck or her colleagues that presents more tangible proof and documentation, with less reliance on feel-good anecdotes and faith in the author's assertions. <br />
1591396190|4.0|Great book, indeed. But another book,Competing for the Future, in the 90s already has the same theme--Market Creation rather than Increasing or Improving Market Share. <br /> <br />Red or Blue Ocean is good metaphor that make this book successful. It is a visual concept that readers can hold on to!
6305511055|5.0|It has been 20 years or so since watching this taut, suspenseful yarn that places duty and honor above company loyalty in the hands of a CIA book reader.On re-viewing this film, I would give this higher marks. Since 1975, media as an information-gatherer has turned into propaganda machine with no courageous patriots within.Instead of hired assassins as instruments, \\"the company\\" just reads to an indifferent TV audience, more diverted by Britney, than the takeover of democracy. The reviewer of \\"Shibumi\\" had things right when relating that novel to this movie.I found it also interesting in light of 9/11 events, that the Cliff Robertson (CIA division head) was transported to his NY office in the Twin Towers, when he set out on capturing the elusive Condor. It is a thrilling ride from beginning to end with a surprising finish. Robertson's character makes a threat, but Condor(Redford)unflinchingly accepts his fate of remaining \\"out there.\\" The only check to a tyrannical government, or one with a hidden agenda, is the vigilant, informed citizen, or one Nicolai Hel in \\"Shibumi.\\" This film is a must-see for anyone desiring to see citizenship in action in the modern era.How long must citizens accept \\"obfuscation\\" and \\"misstatement\\" for the truth?

2013220677|5.0|'The Lost Domain' is a location in which the chemistry of love stirs the imagination with both dire and life sustaining results. With the poignancy of this genre's literary decline in the last century, this domain has become self-referential. A read of this brilliant fiction will restore your hopes for the genre. It is tender and affectionate, and at times hallucinatory. The encounter with the domain recalls Hesse's, 'Steppenwolf' and his encounter with the  theatre of magic. The narrator's loss when his 'visionary pathfinder', the tragic Meaulnes, is acute' for he embodies the key to an enchanted existence, and is awesome in the proper sense of the word. Frank Davison's translation  brings the 1890s up close and personal. Apart from the horse travel(and one marvellous description of free-wheeling on a bicycle), the proximity of close-knit hamlets to eachother, and lamps and candle-lights, the immediacy of the place is striking. By comparison, English contemporary, Siegfried Sassoon's books place you firmly in a bygone era, perhaps as a result of his 'class' protcols. But this beautifully resolved work is free from such distinctions.
0385513755|5.0|I couldn't read from this because it is too big and awkward. I did buy the paperback and referred to this at the end of each chapter for the pictures and references.  A must have if you enjoyed the Da Vinci Code!

B000002KDO|5.0|\\"Master of Reality\\" is the epitome of Black Sabbath's monolithic riff-fuelled rock. If you want music with heavy, bluesy and infectious riffs, melodic vocals and breath-taking guitar solos, then look no further than \\"Master of Reality\\".<br /><br />This is one of those special albums where every track has become a classic over the years. It all starts with the fantastic \\"Sweet Leaf\\", which was initially my favourite song on the album. The song kicks the album off in style and lays down the foundations perfectly. The opening cough/splutter sample gives meaning to the title (and sets up one of the most prominent themes and influences for the band - marijuana). This was truly the start of stoner rock. Please don't come to the conclusion that this stupefies the music in any way - an accusation I have heard many a time. Yes, this album is a great experience when ripped, as are the best of the modern day stoner albums, but don't be put off thinking a sober state will forge no rewards. Bong or no bong, this is one of the best rock albums ever made.<br /><br />The riffs. Let me talk about some of the timeless riffs on this album. Riffs that over the years have become massively influential and classic in every sense of the word. It is through no chance or overreaction that people nowadays refer to some guitar riffs and leads as \\"Sabbath-esque\\" or \\"Sabbathy\\". The grand onslaught of these riffs starts with the simplistic and contagious lead to \\"Sweet Leaf\\", one of my favourite riffs ever conceived. The glory to this riff, and with the majority of Tony Iommi's genius craft, is the simplicity - sacrificing complex timings, extra ghost notes and fancy finger work for simple motifs. The emphasis is put firmly on execution and groove. Take for example the riff changeups in the fine closer \\"Into The Void\\", going from the fine rolling and laid-back intro riff to some ferocious muted riffing, all complemented perfectly by Ozzy's high and melodic vocals. All of this combines to make one of the album's finest moments. Then there's \\"Children of the Grave\\" which stretches the simplicity to a basic rolling note, repeated in a galloping time signature, augmented by the occasional menacing chord progression. This song was really ahead of its time, paving the way for the galloping marches of the finest Iron Maiden. What makes these riffs even better is the structure of the songs, which are intelligent and keep the various riffs fresh. For example, the changeups in \\"After Forever\\" evolve around a repetitive lead riff which gives way to various themes and new riffs, but always returns to retain the original flow and groove. Call them stoners, but this is intelligent song writing, and something ensued throughout the album.<br /><br />So the song writing is clever. It keeps the riffs fresh and interesting and manages to hold the fantastic groove. However, it is the overall writing and structuring of the album as a whole that I find most impressive. The balance of \\"Master of Reality\\" is perfect and superior to any of their other albums. There are no overly long songs, as all are between 5 and 7 minutes. The effect of this gives the album a special kind of flow that is often lacking in their other releases. \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\" are short little pieces that act as introductions rather than fillers, and again retain the sense of flow as they are not too long or boring.<br /><br />Mention should of course go to Ozzy Osbourne. In my opinion Sabbath simply isn't Sabbath without Ozzy on the vocals. His voice has become one of the most distinctive and acclaimed in rock history, and rightly so. He has what all the best rock singers have - the ability to hit the right notes, often quite high ones, and an idiosyncratic style that is instantly recognisable. The Black Sabbath sound is rounded off perfectly by this master vocalist, best highlighted by his inspired deliveries on \\"Children of the Grave\\" and \\"Into The Void\\".<br /><br />Any fan of rock music should enjoy thisalbum. It has every ingredient that makes rock so enjoyable - powerful and inspired vocals, stunning guitar solos and riffs, solid bass playing and some stellar drumming. Black Sabbath at the pinnacle of their career.es rock so enjoyable - powerful and inspired vocals, stunning guitar solos and riffs, solid bass playing and some stellar drumming.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya's past recordings are so good that they never seems to get old.  In a quasi celtic / new age style Enya manifests brilliant vocals, thought provoking lyrics and beautifully synthesized musical backdrops that add up to much more than mood setting music.    Amarantine, although a long time in coming, is brilliant and well worth the wait.  Harking back to thematic albums of the past - a long time gone.  This is an album that musically explores the many facets of Love.    Less than a Pearl - the need - the longing for fulfillment  Amarantine - the hope of what love will bring  It's in the rain - memories of past loves  If I could be where you are - longing for the most special lover  the river sings - the background voice in all of us - driving us to search for love  long, long journey - the commitment to the search for love  Sumiregusa (in Japanese ) - translation - Wild Violet - finding beauty in things along the way  Someone said goodbye - trying to understand the lover who cannot accept an end  A moment lost - realizing the depth of a cast off lover  Drifting - Instrumental - allowing time to pass  Amid the falling snow - A child's idea of love  Water shows the hidden heart - the journey to find love    Each individual song is good.  In a body of work they are brilliant.      Her songs have been used in films and TV shows - still often used to set a majestic mood.    (.....)    Always recognizable, even without vocals, they can't be considered classics although they stir one's emotions as classics do.    The weird thing is that her music seems to always be \\"around.\\"    Enya's CD's, in my opinion contain more exceptional songs per CD than those of almost any other musician.    Strangely enough - so many quality recordings - offer the casual fan an extremely large comfort zone.  It seems almost impossible that a \\"next\\" CD could ever be better than what has already been created.  The casual fan is happy with what they have and only the avid fan always needs more.This one is more - a lot - more.    Caslo
B00000JR2A|4.0|Like With Their album SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR, This album <br />by Tears For Fears, SEEDS OF LOVE, is also made up of an album of <br />8 songs that are long. Some are 6 minutes long, one is 8. <br />The average length is at least 4 minutes. Some of the long songs <br />may be frustrating to listen to because of their length, but if you <br />give them a chance and listen to them over and over, they grow on you. <br />I also felt this way about alot of THE DOORS long songs like THE END <br />and WHEN THE MUSICS OVER.  <br />   Anyway, I bought this album because I love the song SEEDS OF LOVE. <br />I also discovered new favorite songs like WOMAN IN CHAINS. Great tune. <br />I also liked the song ADVICE FOR THE YOUNG AT HEART. Great chords and melody. BADMANS SONG is a cool tune too, but again you may get restless <br />due to its length.  YEAR OF THE KNIFE Is decent. FAMOUS LAST WORDS is <br />boring and tedious. SWORDS AND KNIVES  is average. STANDING AT THE <br />CORNER OF THE THIRD WORLD is decent. There are also bonus tracks on this <br />album. ALWAYS IN THE PAST is a great rocker. <br />     In my opinion, this album is pretty good. Again, it took a few listens to get me hooked on some of the songs, and like I said before, <br />one can get restless sitting through some songs due to their length. <br />But the album grew on me after a few listens. If you are a casual TEARS <br />FOR FEARS listener, I would start my collection of their music by either <br />buying SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR or one of their BEST OF CD's. Only by <br />SEEDS OF LOVE if you have establised that you love SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR.  <br />   Amazon sent me this cd in great condition, unlike SONGS FROM THE <br />BIG CHAIR which had a HUGE and long scratch on the front cover of the cd. <br />Luckily I had an extra CD cover, so I changed the cover and put the good <br />one on SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|Ok, Incubus has been around for ages now it seems, and one this I know is that these guys make singles like few others.  If you make the list, it's a long one, and an impressive one.<br /><br />Incubus is one of my favorite bands, second to only Kaddisfly, and I like this album.  \\"Anna Molly\\", \\"Dig\\", and \\"A Kiss to Send us Off\\" are really, really impressive singles.  You've got your typical Incubus experimental tracks, \\"Light Grenades\\" and \\"Pendulous Threads\\", that half-single half-forgettable tracks \\"Rogues\\", and then the filler love stuff that comes on every album they've released in the last 8 years.<br /><br />The problem I have with the album is that it too quickly went right into my normal play list and saw infrequent play time.  I never searched out songs, with the exception of Pendulous Threads, and that's why this is a 3 .5, not a 5.<br /><br />Pick the album up, it's a good listen, but nothing special, nothing you'll listen to all the time.
0783240236|4.0|Collector's editon is valid for the dvd version to this movie, but the extras for such a classification of \\"collector's edition\\" is still bare bones at best. No cameos, deleted action scenes, interviews, or bloopers. Just a simple unexciting screen test for Miss Hedron, and the releasing of a box of pigeons in very short documentary reel.<br />If you havent seen this movie, you better get on the ball, it's one of Hitchcock's best in storytelling, drama, and suspense. It is not a gorefest even though the theme is about killer birds. What it does is present the situation of people dealing with mother nature's wonderous creatures of the sky beginning to act like terrorizing assasins, and what if the various species that normally do not hang out, decide to join forces for this cause. The gore is witheld, but the innuendos, action, and visuals are there, as well as the fine sound effects of swarming birds on the rampage.<br />Tippi Hedron plays the part well of a rich daughter of a big newspaper honcho, who seems to have timed her arrival in a small bay community with the beginning of the attacks, and is even looked upon as a bad omen by a few.<br />There is no music score like some of Hitchcock's movies, but relies on the build up of an unreal premise in a real world.<br />The climax ending, to this day, has no solid ending story, as this is for the individual viewer to determine.<br />All in all, the birds are great actors, and the biting beaks leaves scars on viewers that dont exist.
B000M341QE|5.0|<br /> The Departed is a great movie, great performances by Damon, DiCarpio and Nicholson. Scorcese probably won't win the Oscar for this movie but he's long overdue and this is the best movie he has made since casino and Goodfellas back in the 90's. I know its a remake of Internal Affairs but Scorese adds his his special twist to it to make it his own movie and all the performances are great and I highly suggest you watch it with an open mind, no matter what some of the reviews say about it, Great movie!!!

0307237699|5.0|I decided to Read the Audacity of Hope because I liked what Obama had to say, and wanted to find out more.  I didn't, however, expect to like it as thoroughly as I did!  Despite a little bit slow beginning, the book drew me in with fascination as Obama used various bits of American history and constitutional law to not only help us understand various issues, but also to educate us about the basics of our society.  It was written with just enough technical information to make it thought provoking and not mind numbing. <br /> <br />I was also pleasantly surprised with the way Obama tries to present both sides of the picture. It's still obvious that he leans a bit more liberal, but he's very moderate in many things and seems to try to balance his arguments. It's sad when we're so used to complete and total name bashing that it's shocking when someone behaves responsibly even in book form. I definitely came out of this book more enlightened than I went in. <br /> <br />

B00005JM1F|5.0|It's a great want to get drunk and hang out with the guys (and I'm a girl)kind of movie. It will just make you laugh and laugh and laugh. And possibly want to relive glory days of college, or just act stupid. It's a toss up really. Great hanging out movie.
0451216725|2.0|Like most Ken Follett books, Code to Zero is very cinematic. The plotting is tight, and everything that happpens moves us towards the ultimate goal of the rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. There's lots of action, and several appealing subplots, including a romance. Yet I was frustrated and disappointed in the end.<br /><br />For a book set in such a recent historical period, Code to Zero is surprisingly sloppy in its details. A character lives in Houston and teaches at Baylor University, a mere 184 miles away. Long commute. A character laments that \\"life sucks,\\" at least thirty years before the phrase gained common parlance. On a related note, a respectable woman talks openly about a certain sexual practice, which I recall being a mortifying taboo for most women well into the 1980s.<br /><br />Most irritatingly, Follett completely bungles the portrayal of the era's race relations. Marigold, Luke's sassy black secretary, wouldn't have lasted two minutes before being run out of 1950s Huntsville, Alabama, much less employed in a responsible position on a military base for two decades. President Truman did not even order the desegregation of the civil service until 1948.<br /><br />Follett should have known better than to make these errors, and far from being minor, they symbolize what's wrong with Code to Zero. It's a slick and empty exercise, passably entertaining but unconvincing either as a period piece or as human drama.
B000HA4WTS|5.0|Of all the HD-DVD titles that I've got, personally, this title is by far the best looking one. Colors are rich and everything else just perfect (well, other than the plot). If you want to get a demo disc to show off your HD TV and sound system, look no futher - get this. Not impressed with all the overly hyped HD-features like GPS map and U-Control - but tons of standard def materials ported over from the standard DVD release for those who fancy behind-the-scenes stuff. In a nutshell, Tokyo Drift is all looks and no-brains-required-movie. I've given it a 5 stars rating strictly based on it's excellent picture and sound quality and not it's characters or plot which I personally find weak.     Basically, kid behaving badly, got thrown by single mom to live with his dad in Tokyo. At school, got to know some friends who races. Beautiful girls, hot cars, Yakuza (mobs) and racing in the streets of Tokyo. Car crashed, mentor died, challenge the bad guy, won the girl over. You want good and compelling storyline, try The Departed instead.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|Well...let me first say....I am a fan of every actor in the movie.  I watched this for the fist time last night (dvd screener for the Oscars) I am glad I didnt have to buy it. It is just awful. I hate to say that...I really do. I thought it would ROCK!  Geee it was all I could  do to sit through it. Sorry  to all in the cast...but if I had paid to see it - I would have demanded my money back. I only gave it two stars (instead of 1) because I truly LOVE all the major actors in it (in their past movies)  --- crazy disappointed.
B000683VI4|5.0|I would like to know what girl didn't cry during this movie or feel an emotional tug during this movie. It's a great movie. Men more than liekly will not want to watch it. But i think that it's a wonderful romance. What most women are wishing for.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|John Ottman, who is certainly no stranger to the superhero genre, having composed the scores to X-Men 2, Fantastic Four, as well as the upcoming Fantastic Four sequel, outranks them all with Superman Returns. Of course, it is a daunting task to score a film of this calibre, especially picking up the slack of a classic John Williams score. The big question is, did Ottman simply re-use Williams' themes, as Alexander Courage and Ken Thorne did in Superman II, III, and IV or did he integrate the themes into his own original work? Thankfully, he did the latter. I conversed with John Ottman via e-mail about this score well in advance of composing it, in which he told me that the main idea for him was to attempt to match Williams' sound by providing music that would best suit the film. Now having heard it, there is no doubt that he not only matched Williams' sound, but also has his own sound and thematic material in there as well. <br />It is obvious that Ottman has a passion for Williams' 1979 score. For Superman Returns, Ottman brings back the main theme (of course), the love theme between Superman and Lois Lane (\\"Can You Read My Mind\\" theme), and the Krypton theme. For the new themes, Ottman created a sort-of family theme for the Kent family, an ominous theme for Lex Luthor, and an emotional, heart-felt theme for the man of steel.  <br />The Hollywood Studio Symphony's rendition of the classic \\"Superman March\\" is flawless with just as much energy as the original LSO recording, if not more. As usual with Ottman these days, the choir has been a big part in his scores and with Superman Returns, this is definitely a huge part. The Kent family theme appears in \\"Memories\\", where Clark Kent first learns to fly when he was a young child. Lex Luthor's theme appears in \\"Not Like the Train Set\\", which features slithering strings and woodwinds. The action music is pure excitement, as in \\"Rough Flight\\", \\"Bank Job\\", \\"The People You Care For\\", and \\"Saving the World\\", all complete withbrilliant brass lines and explosive percussion. There is a sense of Williams' writing style in the action music, along with Ottman's unique sensabilities. The emotional theme is the theme that takes up most of the running time, due to the storyline of Clark Kent returning as Superman, trying to put the pieces of his life back together.  <br />With all that said, there could not have been a better score for this film than the one Ottman provided. He proved that he could not only edit the film, but score the film with originality, as well as bringing back a classic. Truly an outstanding addition to the Superman musical franchise.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Absolutely no complaints!  However, it kept skipping all over the place when I tried to listen to it on my DVD player.  Unusual.  So, I bought a CD player.

B000021XR5|5.0|When talking to most STP fan's, I notice that this album seems to be one of the least favorites. I have to admit, when I initially listened to it from start to finish, I was a little unsure myself. Knowing what I know now, that was the absolute BEAUTY of the thing. As these guys grew and matured (as well as faced personal hardships and demons) their sound did the same. This album reflects that with an eclectic array of wonderful songs. For all of the hard rockers out there, the album opening \\"Down\\" should suffice nicely. For those who love the Beatles, you have \\"I Got You\\", which I swear could've easily been on the Fab Four's White Album. \\"Sour Girl\\" in my opinion is one of the most hauntingly beautiful numbers ever created by the band. Scott really makes you feel the truth and inspiration behind the song. Track after track there is a different feel, with Scott and the boys doing what they do best--- ROCK OUT. Don't believe the naysayers, this album is a killer, and worthy of all the accolades of their previous efforts.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|I usually rent movies before buying them.  Did the same with this one.  Same feeling as in Speed, great chemistry between them!!
0393327655|3.0|This book is definitely not the best book that i have ever read on the topic. Sam Harris is not as convincing in his opinion as Richard Dawkins. I also think that Harris gets really off track when he starts questioning Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy and questioning politics. I also feel that some of what Harris said came across as arrogant, making it seem as though the United States is the best of the best, and all other countries are inferior, what this has to do with religion i don't know. Harris used this book mostly to cut down Islam rather than all the major religions. I think Harris' second effort - A Letter To A Christian Nation was much better. but still read the book.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Pick this up not knowing it was a two disc special,  just wanted to see what it was all about.  Fell in love instantly.  Gavin DeGraw is the new Van Morisson! . . sensitive, passionate, lyrical.  He doesn't possess the typical pop idol voice or much less a crooner's voice, what he has is a lot more.  Every emotion, every nuances of each lyric is riding on his unabashingly strong vocals, raw with feelings worn on his sleeve.  Makes a girl weak in the knees!  Chariot/Stripped is his defining album wether he becames more famous or just a one CD wonder. The second CD is like icing because it showed the process of coming up with the finished product.  It was a nice bonus, highly recommend you listen to this one also.  Each song so masterfully crafted, so poetically written, most are about longings, falling in and out of love but my favorite is \\"Over rated.\\"  about how after meeting that special someone, everything else seems so ordinary.  So for all of you who are in  love, pre-falling in love, post break-up, or in the process of breaking up, this one's for you, come on, it's okay to be sensitive, it's okay to sing along, just make sure you're in your car, alone, commuting from work, with the windows closed.
B000002JSN|5.0|I was first introduced to Led Zep formally by chance. I was frequenting the local music store looking, praying for music with some any type of substance and inspiration after being subjected to our currently abysmal rock scene. Lo and behold, I come across the \\"Early and Latter Years\\" compilation and decide to give these Zeppelin guys a try. Well, to say that they absolutely changed my life would be an understatement. Listening to those CD's showed me what REAL rock music, with complex, beautiful arrangements, lyrics, and vocals was all about. From that day forward, with each and every succeeding paycheck that I received from my crummy college job, I began to purchase the entire Zep catalogue. By the time I'd made it to Physical Graffiti, I'd already cemented Led as one of the BEST EVER. This album only further confirmed that opinion. \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Kashmir\\", \\"In the Light\\", \\"Black Country Woman\\" just oozed supremacy. Jimmy Page is a frickin' mastermind. Robert Plant is a \\"Golden God\\". John Paul Jones and John Bonham are the PREMIER rhythm section rock has EVER produced. This album's beauty is the equivalent of Eva Longoria, Jessica Simpson, and every other hot chick you could think of-- all in one. (that was a dumb analogy, but I think you get my point) If you have this album, play it, and play it often. If you don't --- GO GET IT SILLY.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|My husband and I are huge Norah Jones fans.  He wanted this album, before it was in stores.  I saw it on Amazon and ordered it immediately for an incredible price.  We are very pleased with it.  It is very enjoyable...sort of \\"bluegrassbluesy\\".  It grows on you!  Thanks, Amazon!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Very happy with the swiftness of delivery, the adorable surprise packaging and the quality of both the sound and color.  Truly a collectible.
B00001QEE9|5.0|This movie is a beautifully-made masterpiece that, very unfortunately, seems to be overlooked sometimes because of other old Disney movies that were made around that time (like Snow White).  However, of all the \\"old\\" Disney movies (made before the era of Eisner), this is the one that most hits the mark for me.  Not only is it an interesting story with involving characters, but the overlooked soundtrack is also quite wonderful.  \\"Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee\\" is an old favorite of mine, and not to mention \\"Little Wooden Head\\" is a catchy little tune.  This is my favorite of the oldies-but-goodies because not only does it completely hit the mark, but it doesn't rely on the old cliche of \\"princess captured by evil stepmother and then saved later on by a nameless Prince Charming who has no personality whatsoever\\".  Though some of those movies are good, like Snow White, some of them are dull like Cinderella, and this movie doesn't make you make that choice. <br /> <br />Now I haven't always been a fan of this movie; this is more of a \\"grown-up\\" movie than many of the others that were made around that time.  This is a darker tale than the likes of Snow White, and a more intense and involving one than movies like Cinderella.  It also doesn't follow the oft-degraded Disney Formula, because there's no real cookie-cutter \\"bad guy\\".  And since there's no real cookie-cutter bad guy, it makes it all the more interesting to see four or five villains make their entrances and exits, more like a real-life fairy tale than others.  None of the villains \\"gets what he deserves\\", like in most Disney movies where they fall to their deaths. <br /> <br />That isn't to say that the other Disney movies aren't good.  That is, however, to say that this Disney movie was ahead of its time in its innovations in realistic story developments.  Granted, the story itself isn't that realistic, but we all know the story, and can take it for granted.  And I'm not saying that the film is COMPLETELY underrated either.  Just about everybody's heard the song \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\", and it truly is a wonderfully sweet tune. <br /> <br />Speaking of which, Jiminy Cricket is a masterpiece of a character if there ever was one.  And there are plenty of other great characters in this movie too: the old puppet master, Geppetto, who just wants a real boy; Cleo and Figaro, the domesticated fish and jealous cat; and of course many great villains, including Honest John, Stromboli, Lampwick, and of course Monstro, most of whom are also used for on-the-spot comic relief.  But despite the comic relief, there are definitely some scenes that are too scary for the youngsters, including quite a few edgy scenes including the mad old puppeteer Stromboli.  However, it's not ALL dark, which is good.  There are some very fun, and some laugh-out-loud funny, scenes, both for the youngsters and for the adults. <br /> <br />Overall, this truly is a great movie for anybody, but especially for those who have ever been through the struggle of being a real boy.  :)
0618680004|1.0|This scientist is certainly articulate and prominent at his trade: science.  However, he thus reveals through his belief that science is his god, the thing which he trusts above everything else.  He strongly feels that anything outside of natural means is non-existent and thus fantasy, stupidity, etc.  His passion for finding analogy after analogy is exhibited.<br /><br />However, it must be stated that it cannot be proved either way through science: that God doesn't exist or that he does.  Both are a matter of faith.  Very dangerous to say that any scientist who agrees with this statement is not a true scientist.  It is equally invalid to say that any scientist who disagrees with Dawkins position is not a scientist.  Science has its boundaries, see Alister McGrath's excellent work on this and also his listing of scientists who are not theists who realize and proclaim this as well.<br /><br />What is even more disingenuous about Dawkins is his hatred towards any that would disagree with him.  He posits Darwinism and natural selection as scientific fact, when most scientists if honest would say that it explains the scientific evidence they see better than any other model or theory or hypothesis.  This is fairer way of saying it, that their faith and trust on scientific level is better explained by the Darwin explanation.  Dawkins even concedes that no one has scientific absolute proof of origin of life materials, however once one presupposes this, then Darwinism is best explanation.  Gould knew this and acknowledged it, but Dawkins is too arrogant and hardminded to do the same, even chiding Gould for this.<br /><br />Just as he discounts an Intelligent Designer or Creator for being probabilistic for this origin, he must say it is not probable for his beginning assumption either.<br /><br />The second half of the book is about trying to find a reason evolutionary speaking why people continue to have theism, from generation to generation.  Certainly his analysis is not persuasive.  He does not engage with real reason, that many of us theists are thinking, intelligent people (even some very able scientists) who have examined the historicity of our faith in the Christian Bible and found it to be the only reliable explanation of our universe, planet, human race and condition, and redemption.  Thoughtful individuals might want to check out latest excellent, scholarly works on this by Richard Bauckham and Larry Hurtado.<br /><br />His hatred for all theists is unhealthy, and dangerous.  The very violence he contends religion over time has evincing against heresy would likely be the result of such unkindness exhibited here.<br /><br />It certainly is not a lock tight argument, either scientifically, philosophically or otherwise.

Thoughtful individuals might want to check out latest excellent, scholarly works on this by Richard Bauckham and Larry Hurtado.    His hatred for all theists is unhealthy, and dangerous.  The very violence he contends religion over time has evincing against heresy would likely be the result of such unkindness exhibited here.      It certainly is not a lock tight argument, either scientifically, philosophically or otherwise.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I ordinarily don't \\"do\\" TV shows, but Firefly was more than worth an exception.  The characters and the visuals are both rich and engaging, and the stories take place in a fascinating universe.  It's also at least slightly more hip to the basic laws of physics than your average sci-fi: so far as I'm aware, Firefly may be the only science fiction program that respects your intelligence enough not to use atmospheric sound effects in space.  Highly recommended.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|A stunning performance from one of the best actors in the business. The Machinist is both an exceptional and haunting exploration of the way the mind deals with guilt, and an unforgettable vehicle for the genius of Christian Bale. <br /> <br />From the early glimpses of Kafka's The Castle and Dostoevsky's The Idiot, in Reznik's apartment, we sense that this is going to be one dark ride into the abyss; and it is. <br /> <br />Yet there is a beauty and a symmetry to the ending that is ultimately uplifting, despite its tragic inevitability. I don't want to give away any plot details, so I would just urge you to watch this masterpiece for yourselves. <br /> <br />A modern classic.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|While I think that this is a very good CD, I don't think that it as good as Jones's others. She seems to have lost some of the jazzy side that makes her so appealing. However, I especially like \\"Not Too Late\\" and \\"My Dear Country\\".

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Everyone predicted disaster for Titanic prior to its release. However, contrary to what people anticipated, Titanic went on to capture the hearts and imagination of the world. The immense success of Titanic resulted in many thinking Titanic is now, \\"overrated\\" and some have gone as far to claim Titanic is the, \\"worst movie ever created\\". This backlash against Titanic is primarily driven by one of two factors, jealously and many becoming tired of \\"Titanic-mania\\" accompanied by a desire to be different from the norm. Obviously these reasons cloud the judgment of most of its critics and I plan to set the record straight.     When Titanic was released the world was in the first years of the Internet craze. Everyone was becoming desensitized to human tragedy and was wasting their lives away online. However, when Titanic was released it struck a cord with many people. It reminded everyone that any day could be your last and that you must live each day to the fullest. This is primarily what captivated the hearts and minds of a large chunk of the world. Titanic was released at the very moment many needed a reality-check. It showed us through this brilliantly crafted film that there is still a need for love and compassion and that our world is still filled with human tragedy, not just computers. For that alone, this movie must go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever created.     Another primary reason why Titanic is a phenomenal film is the well-acted love story between Jack and Rose. The love story created an emotional doorway to the tragedy that occurred that night. As a viewer you began to care for the characters. Through this you felt the feelings of those who lost their lives and loved ones on this fatal shipwreck. Having these lovers come from different social classes also allowed the viewers to see the mentality of 1912 through two different perspectives. It gave the audience insight into how man thought they were above Mother Nature, how women were expected to behave and how lower classes were treated inhumanly. The love story was crucial to telling the full story of Titanic.     Titanic has several others qualities that set it apart from other films. Firstly, the amazing music, which set the tone for each scene perfectly. Secondly, the outstanding cinematography that gave a variety of different angles shown in a unique fashion, which thus allowed you to feel that you were actually aboard the ship. Thirdly, the impeccable sets and costumes gave an extremely authentic feel to the movie. Fourthly, Titanic included many interesting facts throughout the film, such as not having enough lifeboats for all its passengers, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings, telling us how many people were saved from the freezing waters and other numerous facts and figures. Finally, the ending tied everything together perfectly with Rose doing everything she promised Jack and eventually dying warm in her bed, while her soul returns to Titanic.     Cameron's film was flawless for it blended past and present perfectly, while telling the story of Titanic in its entirety. This film deserves the 11 Oscars it received (including Best Picture) and achieving the worldwide position of the 3rd highest grossing film of all time (inflation included). Those who tell you Titanic is undeserving are flat out wrong. Titanic revived what was lacking in the new age of the Internet and reminded us that we must make each and every day count.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I think a lot of people were expecting too much of this movie simply because it was from Martin Scorsese. Many were disappointed that this didn't triumph his previous works. Fact of the matter is, no matter who directed it, what movie it plagiarized, or what a crown jewel it is not. This is simply a good movie. In my own opinion, it was outstanding.

1569242739|5.0|A book that doesn't back away from vegan baking as if it's carrying the plague, but jumps right in! <br />My favorite thing about this book (besides the delicious recipes!) is the lack of use of substitute foods such as egg-replacer. I thought it would be impossible to ever bake a cake again without using some sort of egg replacement, but by using a clever and delicious combination of ingredients, this book not only gives you cupcakes that rise and hold well, but that are so wonderful they even fool non-vegans! <br /> <br />I'd also recommend this book to people who simply have a lactose or egg intolerance and miss baking. The book also has low-fat and gluten-free recipes.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I love the Gilmore Girl series! I own Season 1 and am slowly but surely starting to collect them all!

B00006AW2M|5.0|For once, you get the Stones' sense of humor coming through, not something you expect from the band (except when the band dressed in drag for the \\"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby..\\" photo sessions.) But then this whole album is quite a departure from the usual Stones blues-riffing. Great tracks such as \\"She's A Rainbow\\" (#25 Billboard), which wasn't even released as a single in the UK, and \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" alone would make this LP worthwhile, but the rest of it is just as delightful. It's a shame, really, that the band was so preoccupied with drug arrests at the time. There was no video for \\"She's A Rainbow\\", but I can imagine them sipping tea, in Victorian costumes, complete with powdered wigs, and Jagger lipsyncing to it. Would have made a fantastic promo film.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Being a JT fan, what could be better than a holiday album from the man himself. Excellent renditions of classics, as well as some original material. Not essential, but if you're a JT fan, nice to have in the collection.

B000I2J5UG|4.0|MCR has done a fine job channeling Queen through a Green Day megaphone. Kudos to these Jersey Boys for showing that relevancy doesn't mean you have to abandon the past. Derivative, nope; (re)inventive is probably a better way to describe this solid album. The special edition packaging is pure brilliance. The pseudo-daguerrotypes and the graphics accompanying the lyrics add to the overall feel of the album and are as integral to the album as the music itself. Black Parade demonstrates that MCR is more than a gothic token act for the TRL crowd. Bravo.

B00005JPFO|5.0|I cannot wait to LAUGH OUT LOUD at what looks to be the sappiest movie of the year.   <br /> <br />Gone in 60 Seconds was a new low in acting and plot.   <br />The scene where they got \\"pumped up\\" to steal cars by playing Lowrider on cassette tape made me embarassed to be a human being...in the most awesome way imaginable.   <br /> <br />Now that they have foisted this turd on the unsuspecting American public I'm just wondering how many more classic scenes like that I'll have to enjoy. <br /> <br />I'm guessing this will be one of the best comedies of the year. <br /> <br />So until then...I plan to ride hard and strong.  May my receding hairline recede no more...as I blast into the night...tassles flappin in the wind. <br />
B0000399WI|4.0|Well, this IS a long and drawn-out movie.  However, you have to remember that, if you're sitting there enjoying it and willing to pay attention to each and every line from the characters, not to mention willing to pay attention to each new direction the story takes, then it can't be THAT bad.  Come on now. <br /> <br />The final 30 minutes of film were totally worth it.  Think about this- a guy breaks out of prison that can actually have some emotion connected to it?  Yes it's true.   <br /> <br />Morgan Freeman once again shows us why he has never been awful in any film ever.  His presence can only increase the amount of enjoyment you get from a movie.  A calm character he is, one who always comes across as patient and someone you want to listen to for advice.   <br /> <br />Well worth watching.
B000M341QE|1.0|Scorsese should hang it up. This movie is a two and a half hour waste of time. From irrelevant characters to the cheesy scenes where un-needed music \\"busts in\\". The conclusion is nothing special, and leaves alot of questions unanswered. This movie is a joke.
B000002UAR|5.0|First, a bit of laughter -- courtesy of all the 1-star reviews ranging from kids (kids!) to those whose analytical ability reads like, well, a kid's. Even if you don't like the Beatles that much, how can you argue that \\"Revolver\\" was anything but the apogee of their career? I recommend the reviewer who imagined being a 17-year-old in 1966 and playing this album for the first time. As popular music goes, anything heard once is meant for contemporaneous ears. Translation: ya had to be there. So, if you weren't, it pays to know at least some of the cultural forces in play during the 1960s -- and more specifically, the so-called \\"Swinging London\\" scene touted by travel magazines and pop culture prognosticators. \\"Revolver\\" captures the fast-moving pop atmosphere superbly. It was a time (a summer, really) when mop-top groups were finally realizing their potential as serious creatives rather than just \\"product\\" herded around on package tours. The critics who put Hendrix, Buffalo Springfield and Jefferson Airplane ahead of the Beatles are sorely missing the point. The Beatles on \\"Revolver\\" begat the whole second half of the 60s. By dropping world tours and concentrating on studio work, they created the entire idea of \\"concept albums.\\" They also accelerated the competitiveness of rock & roll, but one look at the music charts tells the whole story: the Beatles, with few exceptions, scored a huge number of Number One songs. <br /> <br />\\"Revolver\\" has a style that echoes the cool starkness of its cover art. At a time when other groups still mentioned their name on record covers, you need only see those familiar faces -- in spidery ink, no less -- to know whose music this is. The tracks are superb, from \\"Taxman\\" (George finally getting in a great song, in first position), to \\"Eleanor Rigby's\\" evocative string section to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" McCartney is at his best with upbeat stuff like \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life,\\" while Lennon displays his cooler-than-cool aura on \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"She Said She Said.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Revolver\\" is one of the four better Beatles records (along with \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"With The Beatles\\"). They're all good, but they don't get any better than this.
B00004RD54|5.0|Maybe I'm stuck in the 70's,but I still love this album. Though, when I first heard the updated version [w/the xtra songs] I thought, \\"This is why they edited it in the first place\\". After a few more listens I fell in love with this album/CD all over again, including the added songs. I wore the vinyl off the original album and now I think it sounds as fresh as ever. I turn this on and crank up the volume and listen to Steven Hunter's searing guitar along w/a wonderful rhythm section and I feel the 30+ years come rushing back. Pure Rock 'N Roll Joy. To this day,I can't sit still when these songs start kicking into high gear. My whole body head and body just take on a life of their own.<br /><br /> I can remember seeing G.E. Smith [late of The SNL Band, David Bowie, & Hall + Oates, etc.] playing in a local cover band in New Haven,Ct. at the Oxford Ale House back in the mid-seventies. They covered the \\"Intro + Sweet Jane\\", from this album,spot on. Being so young, I was blown away at how G.E. Smith hit every note and bent every string just like Steve Hunter did on the album.<br /><br /> So maybe Im stuck in the 70's but this album still still makes makes me happy and isn't that what it's all about?
B0002DB0FO|3.0|I love the Everwood series however I was very disappointed in the DVD Complete First Season. It states on the box that there are numerous special features including unaired scenes, behind the scenes fun, the making of a featurette, extended version of the pilot, and commentaries on 4 episodes.  In reality, there are absolutely no special features on the discs except the commentaries on 4 edisodes.  I consider this a rip-off because the special features are not included.  Therefore, I give the series 5 stars but the misleading statements on the box deserve 0 stars.

1878424505|5.0|While reading the book \\"The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom. A Toltec Wisdom Book\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz, I kept on nodding my head in agreement and saying to myself, \\"I agree with that, it makes sense\\". <br /> <br /> Don Miguel says that the four agreements will transform our lives. He says to be impeccable with our word, to not take anything personally, to not make assumptions, and to do our best from moment to moment, are the keys to this transformation. <br /> <br /> Another book I have read recently that recommends living in the moment, is Ariel and Shya Kane's book \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\". I had the same reaction while reading this book, the nodding of my head and the \\"I agree with that, it makes sense\\". With their three principles for living in the moment, I am finding that I am resisting less the way my life is showing up. <br /> <br /> I am walking around with a smile on my face and people are asking me \\"What's Up?\\" and I tell them that I am happy, or happier than I have been in a long time. Thank you to all three authors, you are making living my life easier!
0321334876|5.0|This is the definitive second C++ book, the one you should read after you've read a good introduction. You need to be familiar with the syntax of C++, then this book will teach you about using C++'s features in a non-trivial way.  <br /> <br />C++ is not short on books that provide bite-sized mini-essays on the best way to use some feature of the language, but this is the ne plus ultra. It cuts through the bewildering complexity of C++, providing simple guidelines about what to do and what never to do. For example, you may understand the difference between pointers versus references, const versus non-const. But their various combinations as function parameters and return types may be bewildering. Don't worry - Meyers dispenses his wisdom clearly and efficiently. You'll wonder why it confused you in the first place. Then he repeats the trick another 54 times, taking in all of C++, including some template issues, and finding time to mention TR1 and Boost, too.  <br /> <br />Like the GoF Design Patterns book, you need to read this or people will think you're an amateur. Fortunately, Meyers is a witty and pithy writer and his examples are always very well judged. Make this the first book you read after you've finished learning the basics.
B0000028VT|5.0|The three tracks I came to know via heavy radio airplay in the early-90s were \\"Dreamlover,\\" \\"Hero,\\" and \\"Music Box,\\" but it wasn't until now that I finally got my hands on this gem of a CD, and I'm sorry it's taken me so much time to catch up on some great pop music.<br /><br />I still can't get enough of the rhythm of \\"Dreamlover,\\" and \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\" is right up there with Dionne Warwick's (et al) \\"That's What Friends Are For.\\"  The title track itself is a very pretty ballad.<br /><br />This is Mariah Carey at the top of her game.  She would do it one more time with \\"DayDream,\\" but then sink into doing more covers and duets as the 90s went on (and I'll never figure out why because she sure didn't need help in the singing department!).<br /><br />The CD is 42 minutes exactly, and it's time well spent.  - Donna Di Giacomo
1582701709|4.0|Like many others have noted, The Secret really isn't a secret at all. In fact I've read several other books with almost identical ideas. While the book and DVD are very cheesy at times, the underlying idea of focusing on the positive and what you want versus what you don't want is very good advice. Think of how many times people say something, then feel like they \\"jinxed\\" themselves when that thing or event happens. This is idea of the law of attraction. While I'm not sure that I truly believe that terminal illness can be cured simply by positive thinking, I absolutely believe that the mind is more powerful than anything on earth. If you haven't read or studied about the law of attraction, then this book is worth reading. Otherwise your money could likely be better spent.

0446677450|5.0|While I don't Agree with everything that Kiyosaki teaches, this book does an excellent job of emphasizing the importance of financial education and the importance of owning your own business. The rich dad series should not be the only book on wealth that you read, but it is an excellent book to read for those that typically have trouble sticking with this genre of books. It is a very quick and easy read and does a great job of holding the reader's attention throughout. Just be forewarned that most of the real estate advice he gives is grossly oversimplified.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|I was warned by an acquaintance that this movie was a flop.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  This is a sparkling, wittily clever effort about spokesmen, and a tobacco spokesman in particular.  There's the pompous anti-tobacco congressman, the pretty and underhanded newsreporter, the so-called tobacco victims, the whole gang in fact.  And everyone gets skewered in the end, but not before the tobacco man turns the tables on his foes, confounds the anti-smoking puritans repeatedly, and who in general combines slickness with a quick wit informed by arguments the health nazis never see coming. <br /> <br />There aren't any really good guys in this show.  But if you want to see how a demonized industry can be put in a good light, and how hard it would be to debate a top-notch lobbyist, this is the place to stop.  This was a funny, enlightening film.  I suspect I was given a negative review by a person who didn't think smokers should be so well represented in a movie. <br /> <br />

0061020710|4.0|\\"Colour of Magic\\" is Discworld #1, first released in 1983. Been meaning to get into Discworld for quite a while. Really enjoyed the \\"Soul Music\\" cartoon series and the \\"Truckers\\" TV series, and we read \\"The Carpet People\\" for literature back in high school, so I kind of knew Terry Pratchett's sense of humour. Pretty entertaining, overall, I thought.    Ankh-Morpork is burning, thanks to a new form of gambling known as insurance. Twoflower brought it into the place, being a Golden Empire accountant. He's something of a rich tourist, and Rincewind the wizard's been looking after him. They'll wander across the Discworld, get way off track and brush with Death more than once...    Bit patchy in places, though it warms up halfway through, sets things up well for the series. Bit wordy sometimes, I thought. Worth a look, in the end.

B00005176F|5.0|Blur are a British band who've gone through all kinds of phases musically. Emotions go through all sorts of things on a Blur album too. Makes 'em really colourful to listen to. Colourful bandmates too. Alex James on bass, Graham Coxon on guitar and backing vocals, Dave Rowntree on drums and Damon Albarn on vocals and keyboards. Damon's also in Gorillaz, while Graham Coxon plays solo these days... <br /> <br />\\"Best of Blur\\" has 18 tracks from 1990-2000: <br /> <br />2 songs from \\"Leisure\\" (1991) <br />1 song from \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\" (1993) <br />5 songs from \\"Parklife\\" (1994) <br />3 songs from \\"The Great Escape\\" (1995) <br />3 songs from \\"Blur\\" (1997) <br />3 songs from \\"13\\" (1999) <br /> <br />Mostly singles. \\"Music is My Radar\\" (2000) is a bonus track especially for this CD.

B000M06K5C|4.0|Bloc Party is an indie rock quartet from South London. Their debut album Silent Alarm was released in 2005, and was very well received by consumers and critics alike. With the spotlight on them, how would they respond with their sophomore effort?<br /><br />This album definitely has a more somber tone than their previous one. Bloc Party has chosen to describe life in London as the main topic for this album. Occasionally they mention a few high points, but most of what they describe are feelings of loneliness and depression. They touch on some pretty heavy topics, including homophobia and racism. It makes for an album that is much less brash than Silent Alarm. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad. There are several good tracks on the album, such as The Prayer, I Still Remember, and Waiting for the 7:18. The biggest issues with the album are that the riffs performed sound very, very similar from song to song, and the songs themselves seem to follow a very predictable pattern of whispered verses followed by big choruses.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent follow-up to their debut, depending on what you're looking for. The mood and topics covered might become a bit too much of a downer for some people, and others who enjoyed their 1st album might be disappointed by the fact that the group seems to be much more predictable on this album. But, if you can get by those issues, there is some solid music to be found.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|Released after Pocahontas, when the Disney animated renaissance was coming to a close, this movie did not get much attention; this is unfortunate.  While some of the comic relief is pained, Mulan herself is so lovingly rendered that she compensates for the groans. <br /> <br />Mulan, the character, is animated by Mark Henn, one of the main animators behind the beautiful and timeless Disney heroines of the 90s.  Like Jasmine, Mulan's movements are feminine, lively, and nuanced, and show how much love he put into his work.  Her facial expressions are subtle but clear, showing both her intelligence and her girlish immaturity.  It is obvious why he was assigned to the animation of women over and over again; he is a master and considering how popular his Princesses are, I don't understand why he gets less love than Glen Keane. <br /> <br />Equal to Henn's animation is Ming-Na's voice acting.  Her voice acting in Final Fantasy is too good; it only shows off the mediocrity of that animation.  Here, though, she brings sympathy and depth to the character.  Mulan to me is the perfect heroine.  Her goal was not true love, she would take it, yes, but her heart seeks respect and honor first. <br /> <br />The plot is almost cloying but stops short at tender.  Songs like A Girl Worth Fighting For are forgettable at best, but both Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You, the song where Mulan climbs the pole and proves herself, are classics.  While sometimes irritating, Eddie Murphy's Mushu gets a few belly laughs.  Still, it is the character of Mulan that makes this movie a favorite.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I wrote originally wrote this as a comment on one of the negative reviews, but thought it might be beneficial to expand it and post as a review in its own right: <br /> <br />I can understand why this movie might appear pretentious....  I'm not saying it's especially esoteric, but because the method of expression contrasts with traditional film-making it can appear pretentious until you get the feel for it.  This isn't something that requires special technical knowledge, it just has to be developed intuitively---once you get it, it's like \\"ah-hah!\\" and it suddenly seems very down-to-earth and human.   <br /> <br />This film doesn't follow traditional narrative structure, it is more a series of vignettes or impressions that relate to Fellini's improvisational and personal style.  I can still understand why someone might not relate to Fellini himself, but that doesn't render his art worthless.  It is a highly personal, accurate, and outstanding expression of his self, and that is why it is great--- not because of the hype that has been forever associated with Fellini's films and larger-than-life persona. <br /> <br />This film represents a good place to start if one wished to begin understanding other works of art that make use of subjective or surrealist methods in their presentation.  I think some David Lynch films use a very similar technique, though applied to specific characters which are not strictly auto-biographical.   <br /> <br />8 1/2, does a very good job of blending subjectivity and \\"objectivity\\" throughout.  It is an interesting portrait of a person's psyche---his psyche shapes his reality, and vice versa.  In this light, every person's reality is truly their own, though I can't know if Fellini really intended to make any larger implications such as these.  Fellini knows himself best, his own bank of experiences and perceptions form the basis of the content.  All great art is highly personal like this, whether it admits to it or not.     <br /> <br />Itis important to stress that this is not a film that makes use of dynamic narrative tensions.  It has basically one situation:  the main character.  It explores that one situation as fully as possible--- all of the things that make him who he is and in turn shape the way he perceives and approaches his circumstance.  The film is highly unique in the skill with which it does so, and the loose, almost improvisational nature of this film-making is suited to presenting its subject.   <br /> <br />Relying on circumstance to intervene in the creative process allows aspects to manifest that could not have if he were trying to write a film of this nature.  Subconscious and unintentional aspects could reveal themselves, giving the film a psychological weight that contributes to the feeling of personal depth.  These aspects may not be picked up consciously by the viewer except on repeated viewings...this is what I mean when I say you have to develop an intuitive feel for the way these kinds of films work.   <br /> <br />Until you develop that feel and understanding, more emotional than intellectual, these and other films (like those of the aforementioned David Lynch) will just appear pretentious.  I do not deny that there are a lot of folks who act like they understand these kinds of movies more than they do, contributing to the pretentious vibe.   <br /> <br />There can still be differences of opinion in terms of interpretation, but the essence of the film is not intellectual---varying interpretations can simultaneously be accurate given the layers of ambiguity and complexity that great minds (and subsequently great works) possess.  People and works with one simplistic message are not nearly as compelling.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I think Papillon is one of the most underated movie of all time. For myself, I need to watch it at least once every year. First of all, look at the director, the guy made Patton and Planet of the apes and I would say that this movie has the tag of it's director, no doubt about it. Examples, the epic quality, the wonderful direction of actors and in my mind the most important quality which gave it the Franklin J. Schaffner stamp and uniqueness : the beautiful and rich colors of the outdoors with the beautiful cinematography. Think about it. what makes Patton and Planet of the apes so special, I would say the richness of the landscapes. Another great quality of the movie is the pace, the tempo is fast and for a 2 and a half hour movie, it's not easy to do. There is great action non stop but not in a \\"I have to put explosion and special effects as much as possible not to bore my audience\\" way, more like \\"I have great actors and great storytelling abilities so I'm gonna treat you with it\\". I love Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman as actors and here they play beautifully together much like Dustin with Jon Voigt in Midnight Cowboy. McQueen is the central character but he's not taking all the spotlight, he lets the other actors in and that's great directing in my mind. You don't see McQueen the superstar here you see McQueen the actor in a calm and interior performance, almost low-key. This is an action-adventure movie but with a relationship developping between two men which gives it more textures and complexity. So this is a wonderful movie and I recommand anyone to see it, you won't regret it.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Not the best season of Charmed nor the Worse. After the events of last season Leo's lost his direction and beings seeing talking heads. I liked the build up to the Avators not sure if they were good or evil. The Charmed Ones originally being against them then working with them to bring about Utopia only to realize its not what they want. I like that Piper, Pboebe and Paige come to the realization and chose to go back to the normal good vs. evil world by teaming up with the demons. It was fun to see them all on one side. Phoebe and Paige each find a love interest in Les and Kyle but neither romance was that interesting. Billy Zane was an exciting addition for three epsoides. I wish they had him on longer. I liked Zankou, he was a very good demon and had the Charmed Ones on the run ending in the wonderful season finale in Something Wicca Goes This Way. Other good epsoides were Carpe Demon, Cheaper By the Dozen, and Charmed Noir.
B000063UR2|3.0|I saw this in the theatre when I was a teen, and my memories of it didn't really live up to the rewatching.  I want so much to love this film - the idea of Scott making a dark gothic fantasy film... sounds delicious! But the sets have that claustrophobic feeling of being \\"sets\\", and the editing is choppy at times.    It is still an intriguing film, with some amazing scenes that deserve \\"legend\\" status (Miss Meg, Tim Curry doing his thing, and any scene with that creepy young boy from The Tim Drum -David Bennent - are my faves), but there are more scenes that fall flat and feel overproduced.    For me, worth owning for the curiosity/nostalgia factor, and not it's as derivative as Willow or Krull, and generally more entertaining than Gilliam's Brothers Grimm. The production details in the commentary are interesting for Scott fans.  Overall, I'd say it was a failure, but a spectacular and fascinating one
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|This is the best gift to give to someone who loves the Gizmo character. He sings his signature song from the movie and does a little dance too. I think it's an ideal gift for collectors and fans of the movie. It definitely brings lots of joy. <br />Gizmo Rules!!!
B000002KK2|5.0|In 1979, when I despondently thought there wouldn't be any new music coming around that wasn't dance-floor oriented or bombastically loud, along came Rickie Lee Jones with her eponymously titled debut album - and what a debut it was!!!    There have been some really great artists who have come down the pyke with stunning initial efforts, amongst them The Beatles, Carly Simon, Bette Midler, Roberta Flack, to name a few; but by me, Rickie Lee's debut is, perhaps arguably so, by and large the best debut album by any recording artist ever.    This album is immediately immensely likeable. It is jazzy, folky, rock and soulful all at once. It is filled with catchy, interesting songs led off by the hot \\"Chuck E.'s In Love\\" and doesn't stop its groove all the way through eleven memorable songs. These songs are tough, yet tender: I love the brazen, cool, hip style of \\"Easy Money\\", \\"Young Blood\\", and \\"Danny's All-Star Joint\\" and yet I can actually cry through \\"On Saturday Afternoons in 1963\\" and the heart-wrenching \\"Company\\". Her vocals push the emotion of each song right into the listeners' individual beings. How many singers can make you feel such a gamut of emotions?    Rickie Lee Jones is a superb songwriter and these emotions are explored via a variety of well-fleshed-out characters populating her songs here: the now-legendary Chuck E.; Sal the Weasel from \\"Weasel And The White Boys Cool\\"; a young mother and her baby on the lam in \\"Night Train\\"; a gang of youths roaming the night-time city streets in \\"Young Blood\\"; a bunch of devious crooks in \\"Easy Money\\"; Cecil the chef in \\"Danny's All-Star Joint\\"; and the fragmented gang of \\"Coolsville\\".    Yet, when \\"all the gang has gone home and I'm standing on the corner all alone\\" as she sings in the closing \\"After Hours\\", you know she will be alright because she's strong and she has gathered the momentum she needs just as the broken-down car she symbolically uses in \\"Last Chance Texaco\\".    In my estimation, Rickie Lee Jones' debut was the best album of 1979, just edging out Van Morrison's \\"Into The Music\\" and Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk\\". It is not dated-sounding at all because it is so wonderfully original and unique and as the years have gone by I have heard a lot of copycats imitating (or at least attempting to imitate) what this great artist has brought to the musical landscape of popular culture.

0743289412|1.0|What a snooze of a book.  I am all for branching out into new things, but Christ, this story had no point.  If it hadn't had King's name on it, this novel would have flunked the 100 page test.  Put this next to Eyes of the Dragon in the sell bin and try to forget about it.
1857989341|4.0|Aliens in film and literature tend to be highly anthropomorphized. They are usually humanoid, or else they resemble some form of earth life, like insects or lizards. In this book, Asimov gives us aliens who are really alien. There is nothing cliche about their body type, their life cycle, their culture, or their motivations. The only thing familiar about them is their emotions, and I think that makes sense.  If readers can't understand why the characters do what they do, then the book would fail completely. <br /> <br />Even better is that the aliens are not treated as \\"others\\" viewed from a human perspective. There are no human characters in the middle section. The action is therefore seen from the aliens own point of view. Everything makes sense to them, so things aren't explained as if they were unusual. This makes it difficult to understand the aliens at first, because their culture is shown from an insider's perspective. Things slowly get clearer as their relationships, their desires, and even their gestures, become more familiar and begin to make sense.   <br /> <br />This is the most original, inventive treatment of intelligent alien life I've ever encountered. If you must, read only the middle section of the book to understand why it is so special. The rest is standard Asimov fare: a sort of interesting premise, but written in a style drier than dust.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat Loaf is back! He's great, the songs are pure Steinman and the whole CD is like Bat out of Hell I and II. Simply good music. :)
B00005ASHM|3.0|I feel that Pet Sounds is a listenable and pleasant, but marginal record from a listenable and pleasant, but marginal band. First, the good news: there's nothing as annoying as, say, Little Deuce Coup or Surfin' USA on this album, and the four a-sides (Wouldn't it Be Nice; Sloop John B; God Only Knows; Caroline, No) are easily better than even some of the Beach Boys' stronger hits (Fun, Fun, Fun; In My Room; Don't Worry Baby; even Good Vibrations). Nonetheless, there isn't much to this record outside of the hits and Brian Wilson's egotistical but enjoyable lament I Just Wasn't Made for These Times. The rest sounds silly and dated to my ears: when was the last time you listened to the title track? How about Let's Go Away for A While, I'm Waiting for the Day; Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder) or You Still Believe in Me? The group's lack of a good lyricist or instrumentalist hurts even further - the Beach Boys could harmonize, all right, but harmonies can only get you so far. Which is why The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Crosby, Stills & Nash and the Motown acts are all so much better than the Beach Boys - in addition to the harmonies, they also had interesting lyrics, solid instrumentalists, AND great melodies to back the singing up.<br />I understand that this was a big influence on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, so it merits careful study for those hooked on '60's rock, as I am. But there are other '60's albums that influenced Sgt. Pepper's (Freak Out!; Blonde on Blonde; Aftermath; The Beatles' own Revolver) that are far better. This sounds distinctively like it was made 40 years ago. Sure, so do all the aforementioned albums, but they all have a timeless quality this one lacks. That leaves Pet Sounds as a good bunch of a-sides accompanied by pure fluff. All of that makes it one of the most overrated records of all time.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|I Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I loved the fact that it was set as a period piece.  With all the reviews already posted, You can probably guess I feel the same way too. So I'll make it sort and get right into my beef.<br /><br />The movie itself wasn't bad. In fact, I would watch it again just beacuse it has all the elements of a good movie. The ending was good but not great. It's difficult to pull together all the loose ends to make complete sense of it all, But overall it did do a pretty good job of it.<br /><br />Besides the movie though, I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with the Bonus Features, if you can call it that.<br /><br />The 2 main areas, The Making Of The Illusionist and Jessica Biel On The Illusionist.<br /><br />The Making Of The Illusionist featurette was a complete joke.  Basically it was just a general summary of what the movie is about.  WHERE'S THE MAKING OF...???  It would have been nice to actually see how they put the movie together or perhaps how some of the tricks or stunts were done. Poof! You'll get none of that here, Nada, Nothing! Take a look for yourself, it was an illusion, get it!?! Lame joke, I know, but it's true.  There was absolutely nothing on how the movie was made.<br /><br />As for the Jessica Biel On The Illusionist featurette, how about some more of the same thing, Literally. It was the exact same featurette as the, if you want to call it The Making OF... with about another 10 sec. or less.<br /><br />I was totally shocked and extremely let down. Did they really think that the consumer wouldn't catch that or say something about it???  Perhaps it's not such a big deal, but I would like to get what I pay for, a decent movie and bonus features that actually claim to be what they are.<br /><br />This DVD is a perfect example of claiming something that isn't true and giving you something that isn't what you wanted. I understand about cutting costs. I can even understand about cutting corners because of deadlines or finances.  But come on, this is just ridiculous.<br /><br />I don't think it's too much to ask for if you have a decent movie, to make and have decent bonus features that come with it.<br /><br />Overall, good movie, Bonus Features, NOT!<br /><br />Buyer Beware, What you see, isn't always what you get.I don't think it's too much to ask for if you have a decent movie, to make and have decent bonus features that come with it.    Overall, good movie, Bonus Features, NOT!    Buyer Beware, What you see, isn't always what you get.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|My family and I viewed this DVD, and we were very positively impacted by it.  It had the data and science that I, as an engineer, was looking for, and it had the drama and presence to keep our other family members riveted, too.  It is unforgettable and educational.  I have already changed out all of our lightbulbs, reset our energy settings, and expanded our recycling and conservation efforts because of it.  The film has truly enriched our understanding and discussions of the environment.  Highly recommended!!

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence burst out of no where in 2003 to become one of the highest chart topping acts of the year.  The \\"band\\" was mainly the collaboration of two people, full throated vocalist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody.  Together they created an album of epic sounding metal with slight lean towards progressive rock.  This album is not all that different from similar bands like Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, or Stream Of Passion, but for some reason this album struck a note with the general public where the others continue to toil in relative obscurity.  The element that really separates this band from the pack is Amy Lee's voice.  She has a tremendous set of pipes that conveys power and emotion far beyond many of her peers.  Some of the lyrics are a bit clichéd, but for the most part they work well with Lee's vocalizations and Moody's music to create a sonic blast that struck a chord with a lot of people.  Two huge hits came from this disc the leadoff single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" which is actually quite different from the rest of the album, and the brooding ballad \\"My Immortal\\"  There are actually two versions of \\"My Immortal\\" included here, the original album version and the single version with it's rocked up finale.  I actually like the single version of the song better, which is unusual for me.  The rest of the album is all strong with mostly dark lyrics and power chord riffs.  Highlights include, \\"Going Under\\", \\"Haunted\\", \\"Tourniquet\\" (which actually has a Christian theme to it) and \\"My Last Breath\\".  Actually I think every song on the disc is strong.  This is one commercially successful album that I actually think deserved the sales figures that it reached.  If you like melodic metal with a touch of prog rock and Goth and outstanding female vocals, this album is definitely worth checking out.
B000ERU69E|3.0|This is Depeche Mode's debut album and it is a little, well...gay. I mean \\"Boys Say Go\\"? C'MON! I am so glad they got rid of Vince after this one, because as much as I neither condemn nor approve alternative lifestyles, such direction never was and never will be a good idea for DM. On their sophomore effort, they will depart almost immediately into still lovey-dovey, but more advanced musicianship and lyrical prowess. As it was, \\"Speak and Spell\\" is a decent album, and certainly WAY better than the pop noise released today. A few tracks foreshadow DM's future excellence: \\"A Photograph\\", \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\", \\"Torah, Torah, Torah\\" etc., but even though I own this CD and generally like it, it is hardly DM's best.It simply doesn't age as well as their future stuff. They are still my favorite non-metal band and  always will be above U2 in my book.
B00005JNJV|3.0|They FINALLY got somebody who can do a good Bruce Wayne AND Batman! (And no eyeglasses!) Christian Bale looks exactly like Bruce Wayne ought to look: blandly handsome and spiffy...the way ol' BW's been portrayed in the comics since I can remember. Keaton wasn't quite right for the role, (though he did make a passable Batman,) and, while Kilmer was closer, he STILL wasn't bang on the mark. Bale is! However, as to whether this movie is as good as the best of the Tim Burton produced films is another matter. This film is NOT better than \\"Batman Returns\\" or \\"Batman Forever\\"! Both of these movies had incredible, tour-de-force portrayals of at least one character....Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in \\"Returns\\" and Jim Carrey's Riddler and Chris O'Donnell's Robin/Dick Grayson in \\"Forever\\". Schumacher's Gotham City was a little more dazzling, as well. This version is TOO dark, and Batman comes off as a bit of a maniac. The character \\"Ra's Al Ghul\\" is also misrepresented here as well. \\"Ra's\\" is not oriental nor did he WORK for one, but was of some sort of aquiline nosed/Arabic-English background in the comic books, working entirely for himself. And he's a relative newcomer to the BM rogues' gallery, even though this film delineates the early days of Batman's career. \\"Ra's Al Ghul\\" is also a middle-eastern name, meaning \\"The Demon's Head\\". Where's Talia, his daughter?! The rejuvenation pool? He's also supposed to be a few hundred years old, something never covered in the movie! Scarecrow is ALSO a relative newbie! What gives?!<br /><br />I also take issue with using Gary Oldman for Commissioner Gordon. OLDMAN DOES VILLAINS...[[NOT]] heroes or friends of heroes! Just like they should have saved Keaton for The Riddler or Catman or someone, they should have saved Oldman for The Joker, or Deadshot or somebody...someone like Tom Selleck or Sam Elliot should have played Gordon! And when are they going to get Alfred right? Since the fococta TV show, Alfred has been portrayed as tall, white haired, old as the hills and bespectacled.... he's actually supposed to be about average in height, bald with dark haired fringe, mustachioed and proper-Brit-city, with 20/20 vision! Granted, Michael Caine is a decent actor, but it's hard to buy him as Alfred!<br /><br />The plot for this movie seems confused, as if Nolan's still getting his sea-legs with the franchise...the first Burton movie suffered from this same problem, differently: IT looked hurriedly slapped together...this one looks like they just made a stew of every element they could think of! In fact, there were elements of the first Burton movie in it, re: the mixing of separate elements to get a viable poison eventually. None of this really seems to tie together as a coherent whole. For instance, why does Ducard become a villain, after initially TRAINING Bruce in the ways of the ninja? Why was Wayne Manor burned down? I also might add that Batman has NO bulletproof, Kevlar civvies in the comic book...never has had it! Just his utility belt, cape, cowl and leotard! Here, like in the Burton movies, he's outfitted like a S.W.A.T. team member! Makes sense, of course, but on the other points, why don't they stick to the source material?<br /><br />AND THAT CAR!!

0307276902|2.0|I read this book BEFORE all of the controversy.  Far too desperate from the first page to the last page whether you thought it was true or knew that it was not.  This book could not be marketed as a novel for the simple fact that it was not believable.  In order to make it believable, the reader had to be duped into believing that it was all true.  I simply believe that there should be truth in marketing so that each individual can decide what they choose to read or not to read.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|Despite some questionable choices (inclusions as well as exclusions), this CD is a fantastic collection of music from the six-part movie series.  The music sounds uniformly great and the sequencing, though not chronological, works well.  It is great to listen to while exercising, providing an extra jolt of energy (especially whenever the classic fanfare kicks in).    All of the classic Bill Conti themes are included, as are all the hit singles.  I must say though, it is CRIMINAL that Frank Stallone's \\"Take You Back\\" was left off.  This song is one of the most important in the entire series (I would argue third after \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" and \\"Eye of the Tiger\\").  Of the several versions featured throughout the series, I can't imagine why either the original (from the first \\"Rocky\\") or the latest (featured in \\"Rocky Balboa\\") was not included.    Also MIA is the song \\"Measure of a Man\\" by Elton John, which played during the closing-credits of \\"Rocky V.\\"  If only that particular movie had been a hit, this song almost certainly would have received an Oscar nomination.  Considering that only one selection was taken from the \\"Rocky V\\" soundtrack, the execrable \\"Can't Stop the Fire\\" (a horrible dance track featuring a few synthesized riffs from Conti's themes), it is odd this song wasn't chosen.  Maybe it was too expensive to pay Elton John's royalties.    Among the longest tracks on the CD is Bill Conti's \\"Overture,\\" which seems unnecessary because all the themes contained within that piece are represented elsewhere on the disc.  Excluded from the album is any of Vince DiCola's synth score from \\"Rocky IV\\".  \\"War/Fanfare From Rocky\\" and \\"Training Montage\\" could have both been used instead of \\"Overture\\" without much effect on the CD's overall running time.  Clearly, the compilers favored Bill Conti's scores - and rightly so - but those were strong pieces from DiCola and would have provided more variety.    At the risk of too many complaints, I also take issue with the remix version of \\"Gonna Fly Now.\\"  Given the various ommissions I've mentioned, it seems like a waste to have this at the end.  I thought it was kind of cool the first time I heard it, but I would have rather had the \\"Rocky Balboa\\" version of \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" conclude the CD (which would have been a nice bookend with the 1976 version opening the disc).    With all that said, it is hard to quibble with the vast majority of the CD.  The music composed by Bill Conti is some of the greatest soundtrack music ever, instantly evoking the indelible scenes from the films.  Most of the vocal songs were big hits, and while they are dated (almost all of them are from the '80s) they still pack a strong nostalgic punch --  well, with the exception of \\"It's a Fight\\" by Oscar winners Three 6 Mafia, which is new, and the sole track from \\"Rocky Balboa.\\"  That song is particularly out of place, but at least it represents the most recent Rocky movie.  Better it than an MC Hammer song from \\"Rocky V.\\"    The dialogue clips are a nice addition, though I do agree with another reviewer that it was not a good choice to have one of those clips overlap the track \\"Going the Distance\\" (though I believe that is the only instance of dialogue interfering with music).      To conclude, this CD is an ideal way to own the \\"greatest hits\\" of the Rocky series without shelling out for 5 pervious soundtrack releases (and avoid any repetition of tracks in the process).

But no,  it is an \\"endorsed\\" pattern,  as the maker could refer to the Decorator example of Head First Design Patterns (page 97 discussing linear recursive lists).  The pattern book shows it can be worse with a full blown class explosion (p81),  so it is OK I guess.   <br /> <br />

B000M4RG42|1.0|I'm absolutely surprised the way this filmed turned out. I've always loved Clint as both an actor and a director, but nothing in this movie really engaged me. Watching this movie feels like watch someone spilling a random collage of historical facts onto a wall and hope that things fall into it's proper place.<br /><br />I particularly thought the execution of non-linear plot was poor and frustrating because its lack of connections...it's just there and hopefully the viewers will make some sense out of it.<br /><br />The movie also did not do justice for the actual battle...for a war in which 18,000 japanese died and 26000 Allied forces casualties, nothing in the film convey enough sense of the enormity of this brutal battle. Instead of doing the scene similar to Saving Private Ryan, it took the short cut and disengaged the viewer by spending too much time on the historical accuracy of how that flag was raised, who was involved and what really happened....that's all great but I kept thinking, was that it? If I want to watch a documentary I can always go to history channel.<br /><br />Eventually, I found myself leaving the counch enough to the kitchen looking for snacks that I realize the movie was just too long and without a true direction....big disappointment and opportunity wasted.
0974869449|5.0|These came yesterday and I started using them right away. I was able to learn (for recognition only) 12 new JLPT3 kanji in under 30 min so this product's definitely worth it. Before using this I learned all JLPT4 kanji by writing it over and over again on scratch paper. That was a more thorough method but Ive decided that for now recognition is more important than writing so WRP flashcards are a big help. As others have noted they have a nice look and feel to them. All Nihongo students should have this in their arsenal. You'll definitely have an advantage over fellow classmates who waste valuable time making their own flashcards.<br /><br />UPDATE: Using this it took me from February 21-May 1 to learn all JLPT3 kanji with a very lax schedule (weekends only) as was concentrating on grammar and listening comprehension. Imagine what you could accomplish with intense study :)
B000MNP2KI|5.0|but this was the best movie I saw all last year.  It was so good I even went to see it twice while it was on the big screen.  I was doubtful of having a blond Bond, but Daniel Craig does an amazing job in this movie.  I'd have to say I have a new favorite Bond (sorry Sean).  Even if you aren't a big fan of the Bond movies, give this one a shot.  Several of my friends aren't fans, but loved this movie.  This one is more of a straight action flick than the typical Bond movie.

B000LC55F2|4.0|Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have collaborated on previous projects (namely the brilliant MEMENTO) and here take on Christopher Priest's dazzling novel THE PRESTIGE.  Where MEMENTO kept the audience tense and on the edge of the seat and of quizzical mind, THE PRESTIGE attempts to use the same techniques but ends up being an overly long, at times ponderous, and ultimately rather bland examination of illusion and magic and the need audiences have to believe in what they see as an exit route from the mundane lives they lead.<br /><br />The time is turn of the century England (with a foray into the United States) when Magic Shows were a popular form of entertainment (as they still are in Las Vegas).  Two friends - Borden (Christian Bale) and Angier (Hugh Jackman) - are both fascinated with illusion and are frequent audience volunteers for magician tricks.  The boys become magicians themselves with Borden becoming the superior illusionist and Angier the superior showman.  Their rivalry is healthy until an unfortunate illusion/trick fails at the hands of Borden and the loss of the beloved assistant of Angier.  From this point the two friends become archenemies, each sworn to discover the secrets of the other, a journey which eventually leads to murder and the ultimate illusion of life over death.<br /><br />There are so many subplots that they defy summation. Suffice it to say that inventors (electricity scientist Nikola Telsa - David Bowie), magic machine creators (Cutter - Michael Caine), wives (Julia Angier - Piper Perabo and Sarah Borden - Rebecca Hall), lovers (Olivia - Scarlett Johansson) all weave in and out of the plot, at times illuminating the ideas and at times confusing them.  The ending is predictable: it is the only way to explain the Transported Man secret trick. Still, in all, THE PRESTIGE is an entertaining if uninvolving film and while the characters may not make us care very much for them, they are well executed by a strong and literate cast.  The production values are what really make the film work.  Worth an evening's viewing - a long evening...  Grady Harp, February 07production values are what really make the film work.

I loved it, because I laughed so much.  At first I did not like reading about Emma, who was in the habit of telling lies.  She lied for many reasons including office politics and politeness.  However, once Jack entered the picture at her office, it became hilarious.  Her white lies made great comedic material.  I didn't want to put it down.

B000F5GNX8|4.0|Shane Black's \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" is about as profound as its title - this is pure pulp entertainment, a sloppy, tasty concoction of violence, sex and humor wrapped up in a big old tortilla of wit.   <br /> <br />Robert Downey Jr. may not be able to carry a major Hollywood film by himself (see, \\"Chaplin\\"), but there are few actors better suited for colorful roles in independent films.  I always enjoy Downey, but my favorite performance of his came in Curtis Hanson's \\"Wonder Boys.\\"  Effortlessly downplaying his manic energy, Downey more than held his own with stellar actors like Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Francis MacDormand.   <br /> <br />In \\"KKBB,\\" Downey plays a perfect Downey character, Harry Lockhart.  Lockhart is a small-time hood in Baltimore who stumbles into Hollywood in the most unlikely of coincidences.  Once in Hollywood, Lockhart is completely outmatched - he's the kind of guy who stands up for a woman's virtue and gives a couple of good quips, but still gets his head beaten in by the offending cad.   <br /> <br />But Lockhart never stops trying, even if he's not exactly sure what is going on.  In a plot inspired by the trashiest of pulp fiction, immortalized by the \\"Johnny Gossamer\\" novels featured in the movie itself, Lockhart finds himself immersed in two investigations involving murder, incest, and good old fashioned cash.   <br /> <br />Lockhart also forms a twisted Mod Squad for the new millenium with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer, apparently on the Alec Baldwin diet) and childhood crush Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan).  As these three semi-intrepid souls dig deeper into these mysteries, Lockhart also serves as the Narrator, giving the audience plenty of information and laughs at the same time.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, \\"KKBB\\" is too witty to be a great movie - the suspension of disbelief cannot be sustained thanks to both Lockhart's narration (he insists on reminding you that you're watching a movie) and some incredibly contrived set pieces.  That doesn't mean that \\"KKBB\\" is not entertaining - far from it - but it does keep the movie from getting that coveted fifth star. <br /> <br />Destined to become a cult hit, \\"KKBB\\" is a must for fans of trashy movies.  Straight from the Quentin Tarantino school, this is a movie to be enjoyed with good friends, greasy food, and cheap alcohol.  We need movies like that.

B000G759LW|3.0|To date, I still think Stripped is Aguilera's best album.  The song lyrics include raw emotions and attitude that express fear, hate, passion and even an \\"i-don't-care-what-you-think\\" attitude.  I usually enjoy it when an artist throws in a different flavor to his/her normal genre of songwriting/performance.  Although I emplore her attempt to embrace a jazzy, big-band sound on this album her songs started to sound alike after a while.  On top of that, having TWO discs then just started to get old.  Some songs like Ain't No Other Man and Candy Man were fun but over all the melodies AND lyrics of the majority of the double disc CD were symplistic and sometimes even shallow.  The only song I really enjoyed was Hurt, which put her right back into the appreciated singer-songwriter status.<br /><br />This was a highly anticipated CD and I was unfortunately disappointed.  She's still very, very talented.  I don't care how some people say she oversings.  She does it well & apparently safely.  I haven't heard her voice go out or croak during a performance yet as I've seen others, including Whitney Houston & even Kelly Clarkson.  And do those divas sing, songwrite AND dance?  Christina may have been one of those molded teen idols but she has proven herself a respectful artist.  I AM SO GLAD SHE SHED THE X-TINA LOOK!

0440237688|3.0|I've read The Giver twice now for school. I think it is an okay young adult book, but I don't really recommend it for younger kids. I read it in elementary school and again for a senior class. I think it is extremely important that Lois Lowry questions the structure of society with \\"The Community,\\" but I feel that her ambiguous ending is a bit of a cop-out. While it leaves for many stimulating open ended questions, I feel that if you are lucky enough to articulate yourself into a book, and send create message to anybody (even yourself), that you should be complete. What I mean is that Lois Lowry posed questions about society, but didn't attempt at all to answer them. Anyone can ask a question, but who is gifted enough to find the answer? Being the punk that I am, I can't help but be interested in ideas about the \\"cure\\" or \\"better answer\\" to our global conception of society.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Let's remind the negative reviewers here that we're discussing the album \\"Try\\", and not John Mayer the person.  Like many, I didn't find much to take away from his first albums.  However, I was completely amazed the first time that I heard \\"Try\\".  There were always hints in Mayer's playing that he was a much more soulful musician, but the pop music factory wouldn't let him stretch his wings.  Now, with this album, he's showing the world that he effectively used the machine to his advantage by writing pop songs to get his foot in the door.  Now that those pop songs have allowed him to quit his day job, we can sit back and enjoy watching him grow into possibly the next great guitar player of our time.  How much talent gets overlooked or misunderstood because of ego?  The first time I heard this album I couldn't help but smile and wait for the condemnations that were sure to follow.  If this album was the first that we had ever heard from John Mayer, I think that this Amazon page would be a totally different ballgame.  Keep an open mind.  Don't get stuck in the past; that's what makes you old...
B00005V9IK|4.0|I loved this movie in the theater and I loved it last month on DVD at home.  My wife had never seen it and enjoyed it immensely.  The effects still hold up.  Will Smith is perfect as always, funny, tough, real.  Vivica Fox holds her own, and this is a perfect vehicle for Jeff Goldblum to play himself again.  About the only thing that hung this up for me was some goofy editing here and there, oh and Bill Pullman.  Just not convincing as an ex-fighter-jock, a husband, a father, or the President.  He looked like he was trying too hard, and thinking about his role too much.
1582701709|2.0|This book reminds me of the Donnie Darko movie where all the adults have mindlessly bought into a new philosophy that defies logic and only D.D. has the presence of mind to question it and then is reprimanded for it.  The book touts the old catch-22 round robin philosophy - if and only if you truly believe, then and only then will you reap.  Some of it reminds of scientology - you are precisely where you are supposed to be at this stage of your life since various converging factors are at play that make it inevitable.  Yet where is personal responsibility?  The bottom line is that I alone am responsible for my own conduct regardless of who is supposedly at the helm and regardless of what others are doing or not doing.  Living among others in any society brings with it influences.  If those influences embrace kindness and humanity everyone benefits.  I see no dishonor in promoting a perspective that fosters goodwill.  History has witnessed too many abuses by zealots in the name of belief systems.  The authors should have donated a percentage of the profits to the mentally ill or some other worthy cause however so as not to appear greedy.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I never considered Disney's \\"Peter Pan\\" to be one of their best animated classics up there with \\"Bambi\\" and \\"Pinocchio,\\" and it was while watching all of the extras that come with this Platinum Edition that I figured out why this is the case.  Much is made of Walt Disney's affection for the J.M. Barrie's story of the boy who would not grow up, and it dawned on me that I always identified more with Tom Swift, the boy inventor, than with Peter Pan.  Consequently I have developed a hypothesis that there is a choice to be made between Peter Pan and Tom Swift, similar to those we make between Superman and Batman, Elvis and the Beatles, Ginger and Mary Ann, etc., as part of our pop culture consciousness.  However, that being said, even those of us who were in a hurry to grow up can still enjoy Disney's unique take on Peter Pan in this 1953 version.<br /><br />As most of us know from \\"Finding Neverland\\" or our own familiarity with the story of the story, \\"Peter Pan\\" was originally a stage production with actors being hoisted on wires to fly, Tinker Bell being created by a flashlight, an actor playing Nana and a young woman as Peter.  Disney's animated version has great fun making the characters fly, turns Tinker Bell into a pantomime pixie who would become the icon of the Disney studio, and for the first time had the boy who never grew up being modeled and voiced by an actual boy (Bobby Driscoll).  Wendy is voiced by Kathryn Beaumont, who had just done the title character Disney's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" by vocally the show is stolen by the great Hans Conreid as both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling, and Bill Thompson as the memorable Mr. Smee.<br /><br />One of the things that proves the immortality of \\"Peter Pan\\" is how many different versions of it work, each providing its own twist on the tale (my favorite is director P.J. Hogan's 2003 film version, which I think is far and away the best version for adults).  Here the emphasis is on Neverland as the greatest playground ever, where Captain Hook and Tinker Bell take turns stealing the film.  Peter Pan is a bit more of an imp here than elsewhere, but that is balanced by the gravitas that Wendy brings to the proceedings.  The only serious flaw here is the depiction of the Indians, although a consideration of the song \\"What Makes the Red Man Red?\\" from the perspective of contemporary political correctness may still find the racism more silly than anything else.  It goes without saying that these attitudes are true to the times, and my preference has always been for pointing out these flaws rather than editing or ignoring them.<br /><br />I might not consider this a top tier Disney film, but the DVD extras more than make up the difference, because once again we the studio treating its classic film the way all classic films should be treated on a 2-disc DVD set (which includes a new digital restoration).  On Disc 1 there is a sneak peak for the upcoming \\"Tinker Bell\\" computer animated movie, an opportunity to sing along with the movie's song, and a storybook of \\"Peter's Playful Prank.\\"  Then there is the audio commentary track is a compilation of interview clips \\"hosted\\" by Roy Disney.  The commentary bears no relation to what is happening on screen so it really is just to be listened to and you will find that several of the bits appear in the featurettes on Disc 2.  It is fascinating to listen to the likes of film critic/historian Leonard Malting, animators Marc Davis (Tinker Bell), Frank Thomas (Captain Hook), and Ollie Johnston, along with actresses Beaumont and Margaret Kerry (model for Tinker Bell), and others.<br /><br />On Disc 2 you get to the Backstage Disney section, which includes Walt Disney's own explanation for \\"Why I Made 'Peter Pan,'\\" a mini-documentary on \\"The Making of 'Peter Pan,'\\" and one of the highlights of the extra features, \\"The 'Peter Pan' That Almost Was,\\" that looks at the evolution of the Disney version over the course of more than a decade.  There is also a 1952featurette on the film and Art Galleries considering hundreds of gorgeous pieces of original artwork done for the production.  The Music & More section includes the deleted song \\"The Pirate Song\\" and the lost song \\"Never Land\\" performed by Paige O'Hara, along with a music video of \\"The Second Star to the Right\\" performed by T-Square.  For Games & Activities there is an Read-Along version of the entire film, \\"Camp Never Land: Train To Be A Lost Boy,\\" \\"Smee's Sudoku Challenge,\\" \\"Tarrrget Practice,\\" and \\"Tink's Fantasy Flight,\\" all of which will appeal to the wee folk who are not familiar with playing computer games on an actual computer.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|It's always strange watching a film on DVD. Living in a town where some movies never even get shown for fear of no one going to see it (we only have one screen and show one movie at a time for 3-7 days so some never get shown), I go off of what the general public is saying about a movie. Rather than walk into a movie cold with no critic or fan reviews or box office tallys, I see all criticisms and praise and decide whether a film deserves a watch. So we get Babel which many people love while others say it's \\"overrated\\" and never reaches the heights it thinks it's at. I wouldn't say it's the best film ever but it certainly was a worthy watch.    The film follows 4 yet connected storylines: in Morocco, 2 boys testing out a rifle fire upon an American tour bus and the police closing in on them. The one who was fired upon was Susan, an American travelling with her husband Richard and the lack of immediate help generated since it's perceived as a terrorist attack. Back in America, Richard and Susan's kids are being taken care of by Amelia, their Spanish caretaker who, along with her nephew Santiago, take the kids to Mexico to attend a wedding. And in Japan, deaf-mute girl Chieko struggles with her inability to connect and acts in sexually forward ways.    Out of all the storylines, the Japan segments are the least directly connected to the shooting but oddly, it's the most engaging. I sincerely hope Rinko Kikuchi wins the award because she's flat-out phenomenal in this. Simple looks are all that's needed and one scene towards the end is so heartbreaking you just want to hug this girl. The rest are equally great too, even the Moroccan kids. The main storyline, Richard and Susan, will depend on how much you can look past the faces of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Yeah they act well yet there's always that feeling of \\"wow, one half of Brangelina can act\\". It's not really his fault but it comes with the superstar celebrity status he has: audiences see him less as a characterthan Brad Pitt playing Brad Pitt playing a character named something other than Brad Pitt.    For me the film's big flaw is the editing. No, this isn't one of those quick-paced edit films like Michael Bay's but rather it's the way in which we leave each segment. When one segment ramps up in emotion and pace, we skip across the continent somewhere else. That builds and off we go somewhere else. The scenes should've had a bit of time to breath before we're carted away somewhere else. Not to mention some might feel one storyline shouldn't get as much screen time or one should get more than the other. While Japan is my favorite, it's also the least connected to the American storyline while the Moroccan storyline doesn't have as much interesting scenes to warrant much attention. But that's the nature of these films: not enough material for a full-length film on each segment but too much or too little to be combined.    Should it win Best Picture? My guess is that the Departed will win simply because the Academy realizes Martin Scorsese hasn't won and give it to him as a \\"sorry it took so long\\" award but I wouldn't protest if this won. Unlike Crash, which I hated on first viewing and hated when Jack Nicholson read out its name for Best Picture, this I'd be like: \\"alright, least it went to a good movie.\\"

B000LC55F2|5.0|Christopher Nolan gained much praise for his work in the twist-filled Memento but gained even more recognition when he successfully kickstarted the battered Batman franchise in Batman Begins. As a roadstop in-between the Batman sequel, he did this film focusing on magicians and the mystery of illusion. Maybe because of this, the film didn't get much attention; trading box-office success for critical praise. Too bad cause this was ultimately one of the year's best films that at times takes too many sleight of hands but in the end is masterful in its story unfolding. <br /> <br />Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) are 2 fellow magicians who become rivals when tragedy strikes. Borden is the most talented magician but the one with the least charisma. Angier is a true showman and performer but not the know-how on tricks and thinking to pull off magic feats. Both want to one-up the other; thinking of bigger illusions and even sabatoging the other's performance. To spoil any more would be a crime and you'll see how far one can go in the name of being \\"the best\\". <br /> <br />One of the problems when you have a film like this, especially one about magic is not only not revealing anything that will spoil the film but also letting the film outsmart watchers who dissect everything. \\"Was that an important plot point?\\" \\"Is that part of the twist?\\" Some guessed the film's twist but I honestly didn't even know simply because there was no reason to dwell on that particular thing. The fault the film does though is get too twist-y. It at times felt like \\"I fooled you! no wait you fooled me, now I'm gonna fool you back!\\" It piles on a story element after another until your hurt head hurts.  <br /> <br />Acting-wise though this is perfect across the board. Bale and Jackman play great rivals and characters while we also have Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and Scarlett Johansson with even Ziggy himself, David Bowie showing up in a impressive role since he isn't bad in the role.The one weak link although it's a needed character is Johansson. Remember Chris Rock's joke about Jude Law and what movies he wasn't in? Maybe it's just Johansson overkill but she just stands out since we just seen her in too much it seemed. <br /> <br />My guess is that we're going to get double-dipped. Since this wasn't a Best Picture contender, there's no reason why the extras are so slight but all we get is a brief and surface-skimming making-of and an art gallery. This should've got way more extras although the one that people look forward to, a director commentary, is not as anticipated since Nolan isn't the most engaging commentator but still, we should've got more than this. <br /> <br />Definately go and watch this and experience something that should've had more attention when it started.
0452281881|2.0|I came late to this book because I'm afraid of Y2K and the social upheaval it might cause.<br /><br />I didn't want to read yet another book about the Millennium.  So, it took me about 7 years to take this down from my shelf and read it.  I have a special shelf labelled, \\"Les Voyelles\\" on which I keep my books the titles of which are composed solely of vowels.  If you think \\"E\\" is long and drawn out, have you ever tried Louis Zukofsky's \\"'A'\\"  I didn't think so.  Warhol wrote a novel almost as long, \\"A,\\" not a bad book by the way.  But this one is just awful.<br /><br />Maybe it was timely back in the day when people were interested in the inner workings of ad agencies.  My English uncle tells me that Matt Beaumont used to work for the very same supply house on which Ricky Gervais based his BBC sitcom \\"The Office.\\"  If you're a fan of the US version with Steve Carell, you won't care for this, because all the jokes are old as the hills and the characters are complete duds.<br /><br />It's like a e-mail version of the CARRY ON movies which even the British gave uyp as a bad job over 25 years ago.<br /><br />And told in relentless e-mails, supposedly funny, which are all in the same voice, so you can't tell the characters apart except for the dumb Finn.  Finns unite and shame this wanker Beaumont out of his UK supremacy as chief heir to Wodehouse.  Even dead Wodehouse is more alive than this schlockmeister.<br /><br />And you won't find out anything our didn't know about Y2K, though a lot about Miller Shanks, an ad agency somewhere in London.
B000044TZU|5.0|This is my favorite work from Natalie Merchnt, & I can only hope she is busy working on something equally amzing now, if that is even possible.  This entire CD is honest, soulful, beautiful, heartbreaking, yet hopeful & uplifting. It is one of the few I will never tire of.
1582701709|4.0|I found Byrne's THE SECRET to be a real positive and very inspiring. I had just finished Bob Harrison's \\"Saturday Night Crisis Lines\\" and it was wonderful. This one stayed right up there with it.
006056251X|5.0|So often the heros of historical romances are portrayed as a generic version of tall, dark and handsome with as much personality as the prince in a Disney fairy tale. Lord St. Vincent, while still tall, OK - fair, and handsome, is flawed and - miracle of miracles - has a sense of humor. Evie is just as endearing. I've read this one over and over and I still enjoy it. Highly recommended!
0061150142|4.0|Jodi Picoult does an awesome job with this book. I absolutely loved the book. However, I gave it 4 stars because the ending was somewhat confusing to me....I didn't really enjoy how the book was ended. <br />I would still recommend it!!!
B000KCHZK6|1.0|Well.... I am not surprised...After a great first album and a middle of the road second album Nora did what i thought would happen run out of gas and music.  These performers today have such little life experiences that how can they have 30 year careers like the great singer/songwriters of the 40's 50's 60's and 70's.  Just another flash in the pan, however the recording quality is awesome ...typical BLUE NOTE quality.  An audiophile will love the sound quality but can you sit through it!!!!!!!!!!!NOT  NOT NOT
B0000033P2|5.0|'Trilogy' is probably the most cohesive and accessible of the early ELP albums, along with the Tarkus Suite and the Karn Evil movements of Brain Salad Surgery. 'Hoedown' became a live performance staple for the band. 'The Sheriff' expanded and improved upon the 'Jeremy Bender' comic relief formula from Tarkus. I 1st heard 'Trilogy' when I was 14 and the music left a huge impression on me. I played 'Trilogy' over and over again during a period of loneliness and alienation and the music just sunk into my bones and became part of my DNA. At the time bands like 'Yes' were not as musically or lyrically accessible to me. My teenaged brain could totally relate to Greg Lake's words. He may have been artistically responding to the critics of 'Tarkus' with 'The Endless Enigma Part 1'(who knows) but I knew what he was talking about because I felt exactly the same. There may never have been a greater musical virtuoso than Keith Emerson to grace an Arena rock stage. His keyboard work throughout this album is simply jaw dropping. Between this album and 'Tarkus' he set the bar impossibly high for all comers. Greg Lake kept up and complimented Keith with his powerful voice and distinctive basslines. 'From The Beginning' improves upon the 'Lucky Man' formula from the 1st album I think because it adds a degree of sophistication that would be rehashed again on Brain Salad Surgery with 'Still You Turn Me On'. Carl Palmer is a percussionist who saught out complexity because his talent was immense as can easily be heard throughout the band's early recorded work. For my money 'Tarkus' and 'Trilogy' are the best albums this band ever made. Not many of these cuts truly translate well to live performance because of their intricacy, tempos and tracking,(monitoring on a huge stage is a nightmare) but that's okay. This is still one of the most talented bands that pop,(yeah these albums were introduced to me by my younger sister along with other million selling acts like like Led Zeppelin, CSN&Yand Steppenwolf so these guys sold huge) music ever produced. To me only jazz greats like John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker rank higher musically.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I may have liked this film a little better if I had known that there was complexly disguised sci-fi at its' core. Not knowing that, the payoff made me feel like I was watching a pretty good film, then all of a sudden it disappeared. Abracadabra!!  I think I'll go watch the Illusionist again. <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Boy does this CD bring back memories.  Really great Beatles songs.  Great buy.
B00008G9JO|5.0|<br />Quite simply one of Tull's best.   <br /> <br />Granted, it leans a bit toward the \\"acoustic\\" side of Tull, but it has all the good trademarks of the best Jethro Tull music: Ian Anderson's characteristic flute, Martin Barre's virtuosic and streamlined electric guitar, syncopated rhythms with complex arrangements, insightful lyrics, and (especially on this album) that \\"earthy\\" feel. <br /> <br />My only complaint would be that Ian Anderson's voice has a bit of that flat and robotic feel that it does on the middle-era albums, less raw than the early ones and less free and relaxed than on recent releases. <br /> <br />I first heard the album when my mother bought it because of the horses on the cover; but perhaps a band rooted in rural living and named after the inventor of the seed drill (which contributed to the 18th-century agricultural revolution by making planting seeds more efficient) would do best with such rural themes anyway!   <br /> <br />Heavy Horses is also a nice companion to the more outdoorsy \\"Songs from the Wood.\\"  I see them as a pair, although I don't know if they were intended or created that way.  <br /> <br />
B000000XB9|5.0|Really great CD.  Well worth the money.  Bad Moon Rising always reminds me of my days in the USMC cruising on I95 on the weekends.  All the songs are great.
0670038040|5.0|John Mortimer's latest Rumpole novel needs another 5-star review about as much as his crusty, curmudgeonly bard of the Old Bailey needs a leader on a simple breaking and entering trial. But I'll go ahead and give it to him anyway.<br /><br />Mortimer has bested his most recent Rumpole efforts with this modern case of terrorism and a goverment too eager to overlook longheld beliefs about rights and freedom.<br /><br />In the hands of many, such a book could be tedious and preachy, but in Mortimer's deft hands, it is, like all Rumpole novels, a rollicking, witty, and light tale of intrique that Mortimer fans will delight in.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was the lead-in TV series to the movie \\"Serenity\\".  It was extremely well done.  Anyone who has seen, or purchased, \\"Serenity\\" will appreciate this series.
B00005B1W7|4.0|Ben Gazzara plays a rather cynical Jewish author who is inspired to write about an ex concentration camp doctor played by Hopkins. The book tells of the inhumane things that were done to the inmates of the camp. The doctor is outraged and sues the author for defamation. The trial takes up most of the second half of the film. Queen's Bench Seven is the name of the court room. Films are shown about the Holocaust and they are as horrific today as they ever were. The trial has the only kind of ending that it could have and that means that there really are no winners in a story like this one. It's great drama even if a bit harrowing at times and the cast turns in some great performances. This was actually the first TV mini-series and was shown in at least two parts when it first came out. Written by Leon Uris and based on a similar court case that he was involved in. Well worth your time even though it's a bit slow to start with.
B000AOENJA|5.0|For some who already know of David Gray this is an album that takes some getting use to. When my wife and I first listened to it it took us by surprise. We,like most are use to most David Gray songs being driven by his voice and a strong guitar.  This album however has much more to added to it. Why shouldn't it? He has said himself that he is no longer the \\"underdog\\" but the \\"overdog\\" so he should start acting like it:) He has bought Church Studios and has a new producer to help him. Any one who has heard him live knows he is always working on past songs to make the most out of them. On this album he has taken some time off (3 years) and taken his time adding new levels to his song layouts and production. This is an album that was mostly written and performed on piano. We ended up listening to it twice in a row. The first time we didn't expect such a big production so the second time was to enjoy it now that we knew what to expect. I have found out that a lot of these songs were written to be used as a movie soundtrack and it sounds like that was the intent. From it's gradual introductions to it's slow tempo through most of the album it has a definite emotional theme that takes you on a soulful journey. Some have complained that this album is \\"too slow\\" and it may be compaired to his other albums but that should only bother those who haven't taken the time to listen to his words and beautiful melodies and accept this as it's own album full of his usual passion and power. After the first listen you will have each haunting and fun song stuck in your head. After getting all the singles for the wonderful bonus B-sides I'm convinced this should have been a double album. <br />The bonus DVD side has a wonderful \\"behind the scenes\\" video of Gray and his drummer Clune working on the album and Gray talking about what made him write certain songs. I love stuff like this. It shows the creation of the songs I cerish and lets us see Grays thinking and creative process. I only pray all his albums have features like this on them from now on. In todays world where there is so much room on discs why shouldn't they. I hope this helped:)
B000FIMG68|5.0|I think this second season is under-rated. Most folks point to the first season as the best, I think this one is every bit as good. I highly recommend this, if you're into this genre and of course, have seen Season One.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This album is AMAZING!!!  From beginning to end this disc blew me away on my first listen.  It is one of very few albums that brought a tear to my eye it was so good.  To hear something this fresh and pure is an amazing thing.  This was my first taste of 30STM a few years ago, and it, of course, left me wanting more.  I picked up \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" the day it came out in '05.  I really love that album too.  \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is a little different, a little less progressive, but it's still my best purchase of 2005-2006.  This album just takes me to a much higher place.  Out of the 100's of rock albums I've heard, this one is in my top 3.    This album is a must buy if you like \\"A Beautiful Lie\\".
B00005JM0B|5.0|This 2-disc Special Edition DVD has some of the best features that I have ever seen on a DVD. This is most fitting given the fact that this is one of the very best Science Fiction movies that I have ever seen. The performances are excellent as are the direction and script. You can tell that the producers of both the movie and the Special Edition really dedicated themselves to their tasks.   This is important because there are so many 2 disc \\"special edition\\" DVD's out there that when you really get right down to it, just are not all that special.

0143038419|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a book about Elizabeth Gilbert's Search for Everythng Across Italy, India and Indonesia.  What she finds is pleasure in learning the Italian language.  She learned the language by going to school,  reading the newspaper, and even going to soccer games.  She also found pleasure going around the country eating delicious food like pizza and mushrooms.  Elizabeth Gilbert found friendship with a man named Richard in a temple in India.  He taught her to let go of the guilt from her failed relationships and forgive herself. She struggled learning the long daily chants, but she eventually learned to appreciate the discipline the life in the temple provided  In Indonesia, she continued her spiritual growth  by learning meditation exercises from a medicine man.  A memoir with this title has to include someone falling in love.  Gilbert does fall in love with a Brazilian business man named Felipe.  However, what is more satisfying is that Elizabeth finally learns to love and accept herself at the end of the book.  Gilbert is also a very descriptive writer.  I could visualize myself walking with her on the beautiful beaches in Bali reading this book. I could also see myself looking at the lovely fountains in Rome too.  This is an entertaining memoir.
0743289412|4.0|This is my first Stephen King book.  The character development is excellent.  A couple of scenes are masterpieces.  In contrast to other reviewers I thought \\"Bad Gunky\\" was a great concept.  Some parts got too wierd and cliche though.  Should have been more mystery and less science fiction.  Bottom line - very good.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Synopsis: Can two rival turn of the century (1800-1900's) magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) discover the ultimate magic trick without killing each other in the process?<br /><br />The '06 release of the film `The Prestige' instantly became the box office rival of another magical oriented film, `The Illusionist' which was also released in '06. Both have a turn of the century storyline and both deal with the trials and tribulations of their profession and the obsessive compulsive personalities that drive its practitioners to greater and greater heights of prestidigitation.<br /><br />While there are other similarities that could be made between the two films, they are also quite different and distinctive in their own right. What fascinated me about `The Prestige' is the inclusion of the real life visionary, scientist Nikola Tesla into the storyline. This clever addition added volumes of credibility and possibility to the tale and injected a much needed dose of depth and texture to the magical musings of the warring magicians.<br /><br /> As for the all important question, which is the superior film? They both receive 5 Stars in my opinion, so I leave you to decide for yourself.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins has done the world a service that it may or may not ever understand for the value it really imparts.  The belief in \\"gods\\" of one kind or another is no longer just an annoyance to those of us who can think straight; in today's world it's just downright dangerous, and the sooner we all outgrow it, the better.  Dawkins' book The God Delusion is a wealth of clear thinking, meticulously reasoned argument, and refreshingly straightforward writing, all to the effect that theism is no longer a viable position for any reasonable person to take.  To me, one of the most valuable things about this excellent study is its pointing out, through quotes from correspondence rather seldom seen but existing, that such figures as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin and others not only had their reservations about matters of blind faith, but at times even delivered blistering attacks on organized religion, Christianity in particular-- so much for the pernicious lie we always hear, that the United States is a country \\"founded on the belief in God.\\" Well, the truth is, it isn't.  Wasn't.  Ever.  Nor should it have been, because such belief is, quite simply, a dodge of intellectual and human responsibility.  Bravo to Richard Dawkins for pointing all this out in so lucid a fashion!  It's hard to imagine how any thinking person could read this volume carefully, thoughtfully, and perceptively and not come away an atheist.
B000002KMY|5.0|This is a great follow up album to Heaven and Hell. If you loved Heaven and Hell, you're gonna love The Mob Rules as well.
B000002GKT|5.0|This is just one of those albums where you'll have to agree with its five-star status or take a long walk off a short pier. Seriously. Within months of Steve Marriott's tragic death, Peter Frampton reunited with the intention of crafting a new Humble Pie album. \\"The Bigger They Come\\" and \\"I Won't Let You Down,\\" from the Frampton anthology \\"Shine On,\\" are proof positive that while Marriott's star may have faded in the \\"Packet of Three\\" bar band days, he still had the GOODS. Listen to \\"I Walk On Gilded Splinters\\" and the \\"Leaving Trunk\\" section...Marriott EXPLODES. Frampton sampled Marriott's spoken \\"We've had a GAS\\" intro to \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" for his version of the track on the \\"Live From Detroit\\" CD. This is one of those legendary live albums that is just so GOOD...so joyous, so powerful, so IN-YOUR-FACE...that reviews are almost foolish. Just LISTEN.
B000002LUB|5.0|It was great to hear Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio re-unite after almost ten years to make this album. If you loved the first two Sabbath and Dio albums, you're gonna love this one as well.
B000GYI32M|1.0|:( (extreme frowny face) is pretty much how I sum up the demise of the OC. I fell in love with that show once upon a time. How beautiful the scenery, the characters, the music.<br /><br />Storylines were never the strongpoint for that show. It became painfully apparent when the only gimmick was to bring in some usually downright unlikable outsider to shake things up between either Ryan and Marissa or Summer and Seth. How many times did we grimace each time another was introduced, only to flit away into oblivion or die. There are other ways to resolve things, guys. And there are other events in life to explore and to showcase, to develop - not just kill.<br /><br />Speaking of development, character development is one thing, complete character overhaul is another. While Seth and Summer's witty banter and scathing remarks continued throughout the entire duration of the show (thank God for something), Summer's transition into a Bohemian Brown-attendee just took from her original charm. Marissa never really did have much to say, but at least have her not say it whilst in Ryan's arms out by the sea as a pretty song plays.<br /><br />Sigh. We'll always have Season 1.

B000GH3CVQ|5.0|This cd is a masterpiece....I don't know why it doesn't have already 1000 great reviews! <br />It's not so easy to find this kind of touching music around... <br />\\"Drown out\\" is wonderful...please, support these artists!
B000GY729M|5.0|Ive read a ot of reviews putting down the vocals.  Give me a break, in my opinion neither Bob Dylan or Neil Young or a lot of other popular musicians can hit very many notes either, and look at their success.  I like music this gives emotions and this album does.  I like musicians who let their emotions take control of the song and the vocals rather than standing in a studio trying to hit every note perfectly like a robot.  I would be able to pick out flower's vocals in any song and i think that says volumes about his talent, he doesn't sound like everyone else.  Musically this album rocks.  the guitar, the bass, the drums, everything is played superbly and with heart.  the loops and hooks are awesome and genuine, something you hardly find in songs these days.  Each song has it's own personality and life, and they are all different.   there are only 2 or 3 albums where i listen to it from beginning to end, and this is one too.  the enterlude and exitlude make it more like a storybook than an album of different songs, which almost makes it necessary to listen to from song 1 to the end to get the full affect.  and just so you know i never listened to hot fuss until i bought sam's town, and it's ok , but sam's town is better.
B00005V1B1|5.0|I loved this album and really forgot about it once I transitioned to CDs. What a great edition. Highly recommened.

B00005YW4H|5.0|What a great album. I can't listen to this one enough. Her voice is like silk and is perfect to just relax to. The production is also very clean and easy on the ears.
B000000OU6|3.0|Slash's first venture outside GnR gives a great showcase for Slash's bluesy-rock guitar style, and demonstrates from the first song here that Slash was very limited in his old band. Note: the band is much better LIVE than on disc, but the disc is worth getting, no doubt!
B000000993|5.0|Heavy and thick, Tool's Undertow made a fan out of me.  Actually, the first Tool album I bought was AEnima (also excellent), but the first Tool song I heard was Sober (off of this album).  Interesting video for that song.  Anyway, Metal heads and Progressive Rock fans everywhere should give Tool a try, and Undertow is a very good place to start.  I also have AEnima, Lateralus, and 10,000 Days as well.  Many say that Tool went downhill with their newest offering 10,000 Days, but I'd say that it really isn't that bad.  It may not beat the juggernauts Undertow, AEnima, and Lateralus, but it is worth a listen or five.  Long live Tool!
1582701709|1.0|This book is the biggest scam.  Not being well written, The Secret has nothing to recomend it.  Besides the poor grammer, there is much to critisize.  All you learn from Byrne is that if you think something than it will happen.  I am thinking this book shoulod go away but it isn't happening.
B00005B36H|5.0|There are many words I could use to describe the Lateralus experience.  Heavy would be one.  Driven another.  Hypnotic and gripping two more.  Intense and... need I go on?  Tool has done it again with another strong release.  Many say that this is their best album.  They sure set the bar high with Undertow and AEnima, so surpassing those two would be a tremendous accomplishment.  It is hard for me to pick favorites out of the Tool albums I own, which are Undertow, AEnima, Lateralus, and 10,000 Days.  I would say if you are a Metal or Progressive Rock fan you need to have some Tool in your collection. AEnima is where I started, and it is truly a great album.  It sent the message home that Tool was a great band worth looking into.  If you know you like their sound already, any of the four albums I mentioned would be safe choices, although I am leaning towards the former three.  Enjoy your selection(s).
B000J103X4|5.0|I didn't care for him when he came out.  His name is stupid, and the whole highschool-like date/breakup with 50 was moronic.  But then I hear \\"Let's Ride\\" and \\"One Blood\\" on the radio, and I'm going \\"MAN, that's SLAMMIN!\\"  I can't resist - I had to check out the album.  <br /> <br />Game delivers.  Yeah, I had to skip ahead to \\"Let's Ride\\" before giving the rest of the CD a listen.  It didn't take multiple listens to get into it - track 4 \\"Compton\\" had me the first time through.  Track 9 \\"Scream On Em\\" was another track that had me shouting right from the first play.  It's crazy: a strong flow, killer beat, single note on a piano(Wu Tang influence?), anthem shouting, and some crazy azz screaming.   <br /> <br />There are other good tracks too, and a few lame ones, but overall it's one of the few albums I've bought in the past 10 years that was actually worth keeping. <br /> <br />Gotta get the one with the Parental Advisory - he talks trash like the best of 'em, and that's part of the whole delivery.  Some of his language makes me laugh it's so over the top.  You can tell he grew up with NWA. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I love this movie, and now it is my three-year-old daughters' favorite too!
B000005RFM|5.0|I am still utterly amazed that this album does not get the credit that it surely deserves. I am a huge music fan with many tastes, and if you were to ask me what my favorite band is I would have a very hard time answering it. But, with some thought, I would have to say Black Sabbath, if not for a myriad of reasons, certainly for sentimental ones. I cannot even say that I am a \\"metal\\" fan per se, but I love \\"heavy\\" music. That being said, I truly believe this is Sabbath's best and most complete album.  It starts out with\\" Hole in the Sky\\", which is not only one of Sabbath's most HEAVY songs, but maybe one of the most heavy songs of all time. From there it just gets better, changing mood throughout the album. I implore you, if you do not have this album and are looking for one of the all time great ones, GET IT NOW! You have Lucifer's guarantee....or whatever. No, seriously, this album is magnificent!
0711954291|5.0|I remember the Thompson series when I was a kid taking piano lessons.  Twenty-something years later, I see that they really updated the book to make it more kid-friendly.  I see this book on the pianos in many houses, so I'm assuming it is one of the most widely used children's primers for piano.  There are written exercises, detailed explanations, and familiar sounding songs.  For advanced piano playing adults, they also include accompaniment's to play along.  The tone of the book is encouraging and friendly, and meant to build confidence.  I purchased the second book already as well.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|This was a great movie.  I highly recommend it to any viewer who enjoys thought-provoking albeit sometimes slow movies.  If your idea of an amazing movie is in the genre of the Fast and the Furious or XXX or any other movie where the plot is irrelevant and the only items of interest are blowing things up and ridiculous John-Woo style action choreography then perhaps you will find this very unsatisfactory.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|There were only 2 songs out of the whole CD I liked.  If you are a big fan of house music, than get it.  If not, don't waste your time.
B00000DGUG|2.0|Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is one of the most eccentric albums to have been released in the 90's. Nobody can dismiss it as a complete failure because it genuinely does have its moments. But then of course there are songs like \\"Front Row\\" or \\"One\\" (to name just a few) that are shamelessly self-indulgent and should never have been released to the commercial public. The problem with Alanis, is that she has never been able to leave some things to a listener's imagination. What helped \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" become one of the ten best-selling albums of all time in the United States is that the lyrics were personal, but generic enough to still spark the fascination of listeners. In the case of \\"Supposed Former,\\" the lyrics are painstakingly overwritten well beyond the point of gratuitousness and rather than follow a coherent format, they meander. This sort of no-holds-barred lyrical approach suits certain songs--\\"Baba,\\" \\"Thank U,\\" \\"The Couch,\\" and \\"So Pure\\" at least adhere their obscure lyrics to a structured melody. If all art is valid, then everyone should have a painting hanging up in the Louvre, but the sign of a true artist is one who can temper their artistic integrity in a manner that engages others. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was a catchy, poignant, emotive masterpiece that struck a nerve with tens of millions of people. \\"Supposed Former,\\" on the other hand, is far too self-involved and should have remained in the pages of Alanis' diary; where such clumsy, wordy, overreaching attempts at poetry belong. Unfortunately, this killed whatever momentum \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" had created and permanently closed the door on Alanis for tens of millions of fans.
B000LE0THO|4.0|First and upfront, I REALLY want to give this remastering 5 stars and go on and on about how wonderful ELO and this remastering is and live in the sugar coated glow of the album. But I can't. Even with all the anticipation and hoopla. I'm not going to list every dropout (due to old tapes - and there's several) because let's face the music (pun intended) these tapes are 30 yrs old. One can't expect perfection. I am listening to the U.S. \\"limited book edition\\". <br />So let me say if you have the \\"old\\" Jet CD, this is a nice upgrade. It's well worth it. If you're looking for the best sounding version of the album, this one is close, but not quite there. The only song that isn't a bit over compressed (for loudness) is \\"The Whale\\". Several songs have a louder right channel. If you're going to listen mostly in a car or \\"on the move\\" this might not be too much of an issue. If you're listening with headphones in a room or close speakers, it might. Yes, I am being picky - but why not!? I would imagine most people buying this version likely have the album on vinyl (the SR/2 masterings are the best ones - and actually mastered at half speed by Stan Ricker!) or the original Jet/CBS CD. So now you can have an idea of what this one has to offer. As far as the actual music content, we've all heard the songs, sung along with and just enjoyed what Jeff Lynne created. As far as that is concerned, it's all there. You'll like it just as much as in 1977. The last bonus track is \\"Latitude 88 North\\" - which can be debated on when it was done, finished, who's on it or whatever - but it's catchy tune that you'll be singing along with! <br />As previously mentioned in other reviews, the tight slip case in the back of the book is really bad, as far as scratching the CD is concerned. I suggest either making a \\"play copy\\" for yourself or storing the actual CD in a real jewel case. (Again, this applies to the book version, not the standard CD version with edited book.) Speaking of the book, it's really nice. The paper is \\"coated\\" and there is the little spaceship model in the center that you can build if you really want to.  <br />If I could, I'd give this remastering package as a whole a 4.5. <br />Happy listening!
B00008S2VG|2.0|Flat, aimless lyrics, ambiguous themes, poorly conceived visuals, and overwrought production all sank \\"American Life,\\" but what hammered the last nail in its coffin was Madonna's ego, once again getting the best of her. \\"Material Girl\\" did a better job of reinforcing Madonna's criticisms of material culture than this album altogether. \\"I'm so Stupid\\" is nothing more than a whiny, less spiritual take on \\"Drowned World/ Substitute for Love\\" and \\"Mother and Father,\\" though undeniably groovy, is a rather annoying retread of \\"Promise to Try.\\" It sounds as if Madonna wasn't even entirely sure what she was getting at in the title track. With an embarrassing rap, and even worse video, in which Madonna, dressed up as an army sergeant, points her finger accusingly and lectures about all of the luxuries associated with the American dream. No matter how much Madonna has changed her tune, she can't erase the fact that she once embodied material culture at its most shameless. Mirwais's techno-folk production, which worked well for \\"Music,\\" is over-amplified on this album and Madonna ought to know by now that if you can't expand lyrically, then you must at least grow stylistically. This album fails to do either, save for a few tracks. \\"Intervention\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" are both touching ballads about love and identity, \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" sounds a bit schlocky, but is well-suited for the dance floor, and \\"Die another Day\\" does a better job of capturing Madonna's militaristic vibe than the title track. \\"American Life\\" could've had the potential to become one of Madonna's best if she hadn't appeared like such a hypocrite, the lyrics were developed further, and Mirwais's eccentricities were tempered more evenly. Unfortunately, this album revealed just how narcissistic Madonna still is and how out of touch she is with the true ideals of most Americans.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Many people are scared away by foreign films, myself included. Often they come off as \\"art for the sake of art,\\" but not in a positive way like with MGM. Cinema Paradiso is not a typical foreign film at all, or even a typical film. It is a wonderful tribute to movies and does an excellent job of incorporating history into the story.<br /><br />Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) is a big shot, a film maker who has not visited his hometown or seen his family in thirty years. He gets a call telling him that his childhood friend and mentor Alfredo has died. The news makes him think of his childhood and the beginning of his interest in films. Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio), \\"Toto,\\" visits the Cinema constantly to bother Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and to ask him questions about projecting films. Toto's mother does not like him going to the Cinema; she thinks her boy is bad and doesn't want the flammable film to come home with him. It is impossible to part the boy from his curiosity, and eventually Alfredo gives in and teaches Toto how to run the projector. Soon, Salvatore grows up into a teenager (Marco Leonardi) and falls in love with a blue-eyed girl (Agnese Nano). But his love for movies never wans.<br /><br />This movie can touch any movie lover, especially those interested in the history of film. So much is included here. There are posters of stars like Clark Gable, Ingrid Bergman, Joan Crawford, Erich von Stroheim, Buster Keaton, and Marilyn Monroe. There is progress with film going from highly flammable material to a more advanced flame repellant. There are double features and newsreels and censorship. Most importantly, one can see the community that film creates; it brings people together. None of this is done blatantly and none of it is overly sentimental. What makes this movie stand above others like it is its sense of realism despite the heavily sentimental story.<br /><br />The extended version of the film is included here, as well as the theatrical release. For big fans of the film, the extended version is a curiosity, but it is disappointing as well. The major difference is the inclusion of sex, but the inclusion makes the film less romantic and more upsetting. It breaks the emotional continuity of the film, so the theatrical version is actually better.<br /><br />Also included is the soundtrack for Cinema Paradiso, an excellent companion. The music is as much a part of the movie as the images, so just hearing strains from it can bring back a flood of emotion.nded version is a curiosity, but it is disappointing as well.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Eradicate all the old copies of Superman II. Donner's version proceeds without the childish camp and clunky rewrites that marred the theatrical release. The recovered and restored footage shows Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder and Marlon Brando at their best. How wonderful that Donner and company rescued these performances from the vault. This is easily the most worthwhile Director's Cut DvD ever released. <br /> <br />The accompanying documentary offers a fascinating glimpse into the filmmaking world at its venal worst and painstaking best. <br /> <br />\\"Kneel before Zod!\\"
0140277447|5.0|Chang's book is a thoroughly researched document about the crimes perpetrated on Nanking from the Imperial Japanese Army 70 years ago and perhaps more importantly a wake-up call to  Japan's current indifference and arrogance by refusing to admit or even acknowledge their past crimes.  While the book is far from objective, the overall effect is devastating.  If there is any justice in the world, one day Japan will  make amends for their crimes, and this book will be recognized for having been one small step to that happening.  Recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in Japan.
B000KQGP2G|2.0|I don't mind weird, goofy, self-indulgent music, but it has to be GOOD weird, goofy, self-indulgent music. This is just not good, fellas. PoS, what happened? The production seems cheap and the songs just don't live up to PoS's earlier stuff. The Korn mimmickery is plain awful and don't get me started on the 8-minute disaster, Disco Queen.
B000068FWC|3.0|As a child of the 1980's & 1990's and someone who first fell in love with punk, I just can't understand why the whiny, high pitched, nasal vocals of the 1970's were so popular. That's the biggest detraction for me in listening to this otherwise enjoyable pop record. Upon listening to this album, I realized that I'd heard most of these songs before, but I didn't know who Supertramp was and I'd just assumed that they were by the Bee Gees because of the awful vocals.
0812975219|4.0|Despite all shortcomings of this book, I am very glad that I have it on my bookshelf and able to read (and re-read) it as I please. It is very powerful antidote to mass-market business books, and even though I am annoyed by author's arrogance, I do like to be reminded that in business, finance and life we ARE fooled by randomness, so additional thinking is always required. <br />No doubt that professional traders would find many flaws with Taleb's  method, but quite honestly, I doubt that author shared all his trade secrets with us - after all, he did not pretend that this is an investment guide book, or another \\"How to get rich in 21 days\\" self-help book. It is thought provoking book that has more questions than answers, and I would recommend every MBA student to get one - simply for getting a different perspective on things. <br />
B0000TB01Y|2.0|Is it me, or does anyone remember when Broadway musicals used to actually have songs in them? You know, the kind you walked out of the theater singing? After seeing the film version of Phantom of the Opera and seeing this show last night at the Pantages, I seriously wonder if any Broadway writers remember how to write a song. Where are the \\"Maria\\"s? The \\"When you're a jet\\"s? The \\"Sound of Music\\"s? Nowadays they just crank out verbose, meandering showcase numbers for the leads to just belt away...and nothing more. I'd give my right nut for another Grease, another Tommy, another Rocky Horror Show, Hair, Camelot or man of La Mancha. I know people want to see a musical about the Wicked Witch of the West - I did - but let's call a spade a spade and admit these songs go nowhere (and trust me, I know of what I'm talking about, being a songwriter and musician for many years). Neat premise. No songs.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I had seen the movie and bought this copy to share.  Everyone in my office has seen it and I am now sharing it world-wide.  We all need to be cognizant of what is happening to our planet, if not for ourselves, then for the future of human-kind.  The planet will survive - with or without humans!
055358202X|4.0|That's about all I have to say.  Martin writes fantastically, this one just fell a little short compared to the prior three.  In comparison to most of the tripe out there today though?  You'll eat up the Feast quickly.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Cant really hate Norah's music if you tried. If youve already listened to some older material than this isnt much of change. Five years in and the music she puts out is still quality. The tracks are smooth and melodic, recommend for anyone that appreciates good music. A decent third album for Norah.<br /><br />-Shaheem
B00008BRDX|4.0|The sophomore album from The Police found the band tightening their style, even playing off it via the album's title (\\"White Reggae\\"). They were already abandoning the lightning fast punk that appeared on the debut and Sting's songwriting was rapidly evolving. \\"Message In A Bottle\\" is easily one of the top ten Police songs, contrasting alienation with acceptance in the one simple couplet: \\"Seems I'm not alone at being alone, a hundred million castaways looking for a home.\\"<br /><br />But what keeps \\"Regatta De Blanc\\" from being a five star CD is the fact that there is obvious filler. In the usual case of having your whole life to write your debut and six months to follow it up, Sting's growth as a songwriter is overshadowed by Stewart Copeland's weaker material. He contributes four songs on \\"Regatta,\\" with only \\"Contact\\" and the Dylanesque \\"It's Alright For You\\" being up to the rest of the album's high standard. I always enjoyed the goofy \\"On Any Other Day,\\" but when you compare it to Sting's earliest flirtation with jazz on \\"Bring On The Night,\\" it just pales.<br /><br />However, the full band co-wrote \\"Deathwish\\" and the title song, which shows why The Police were becoming a band of note. Andy Summers' guitar supplies the atmospherics and Sting chants the energetic titular instrumental, giving insight into the band chemistry. Add the chilling \\"Walking On The Moon\\" (by Sting), and you had a sophomore effort that teased you with brilliance, even if we had to wait one more album to hear it in total.
B000JJRIP2|4.0|This is what we've been waiting for so long. All hits in a great package and Alive 4 at least. There's no better live band around the world!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The rich textures of sound is impressive and the sheer joy heard in the musicianship makes The Way Up very special. It transcends the jazz label - the production is perfect - and approaches the beauty of a classical performance. The work was composed by Pat Metheny (g) and Lyle Mays (p & key).<br /><br />Opening does just that and introduces the key structures & elements of the three parts. The upbeat work features one of many intricate guitar solos by Metheny. Drummer Antonio Sanchez drives Part One, with trumpeter Cuong Vu soloing late, along with outstanding interplay between Metheny & Mays.<br /><br />On Part Two, close your eyes when Gregoire Maret is soloing on harmonica and you will visualize Toots Theilman, his playing is that good. Vu's voice especially complements the motif designed by Mays in Part Three.<br /><br />Like a fine wine, the Pat Metheny Group has gotten better with age. The Way Up is nothing less than the band's masterpiece.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|I just picked up a copy of this release, and man am I glad I did!  From the opening track \\"Healer\\" to \\"Ride the Jack\\", this disc absolutely rocks!  The band sounds great, and Ray Gillen's vocals are as impressive as ever.  As others have said, this disc is basically a collection of studio run-throughs, most of which were recorded in one take.  DON'T LET THAT PREVENT YOU FROM BUYING THIS DISC!  The band is tight, the songs are great, and the sound quality is excellent.      My only complaint is that, as previously mentioned by other reviewers, the artwork in the Z-records version is blurry, so you can't read the lyrics.  Other than that, this is the same disc as the more expensive import.  Since you can easily find the lyrics on-line, I'd recommend saving a few $$ and getting this disc instead of the pricey import.
B000069AUI|5.0|How do you know an album is REALLY good? When it changes the life of the person listening to it.  That's what Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" did: not only did it open my ears to a new genre of music, it made me appreciate it on a whole new level.  I had vaguely heard of Coldplay before, mostly from their single \\"Yellow\\" off of their first album.  After reading one great review after another about \\"Rush\\", I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!!!  From the hard-driving first notes of \\"Politik\\" to the hypnotic piano chords on \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Clocks\\", I was mesmerized.  The album changes pace smoothly, from the melodic \\"In My Place\\" to the inspired \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\", all the way back to the exotically enthralling \\"Sunlight\\". There are few CDs in my collection that I can pop into my stereo and enjoy each AND every track, and this is the first from this decade to make that \\"elite\\" list. I've since had to buy another copy of this CD due to simply wearing out the first copy from over-play.  They may have been influenced by Radiohead, but this album proves they've created a sound, vibe, and feel all their own.
0767020308|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD of EMMA.  I love Jane Autin's books.

B00005JPO7|5.0|Gerd Weisler (Ulrich Muhe, appropriately drab) is an East German Stasi (Secret Police) drone: the type of man that his superiors count on to \\"get\\" his prey. Early on in this fascinating, superior film, Gerd arrives home from a hard day of spying on his fellow East Germans and prepares a meal: microwaved white rice onto which he squeezes tomato paste from a tube. This scene, in its spare, workmanlike manner sets the course and adjusts the sights of this film: the unremarkable, out of hate and jealousy assigned to bring down those deemed different, those deemed remarkable, those deemed talented. Weisler is the perfect Stasi automaton: a socialist monk with ice-cold eyes and an incorruptible true believer's faith in the system he has sworn to defend against \\"enemies of socialism\\" no matter where he finds them.<br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" begins in 1984 a particularly Orwellian date and 5 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Weisler is invited to a night of theater by his school friend and boss Colonel Grubitz (a slimy bureaucrat performance by Ulrich Tukor) for a performance of a play written by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and starring Dreyman's live in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck from \\"Mostly Martha\\"). Dreyman is tall, handsome, dresses in colors other than grey and Christa-Maria is wondrously gorgeous and a great actress to boot.<br />As Weisler watches Christa-Maria on stage he also scopes in on Dreyman, via his opera binoculars, watching Christa-Maria with love and admiration. The look of distrust and envy in Wailer's eyes is frightening: his eyes widen, squint and widen again. What does Weisler see or sense on that triumphant, for Dreyman and Sieland, night? Is it watching them basking in the glory of an audience's love and appreciation? Is it the palpable love and warmth between the two themselves: something that Weisler has never, will never feel? Whatever it is, Weisler has found his next assignment.<br />Though Dreyman is deemed \\"the only writer we have who is not subversive,\\" Weisler forces the issue and sets up a full Stasi surveillance: bugs, cameras and sets up a roost for himself in the attic of the Dreyman-Sieland home.<br />Then in the process of spying on these two warm, happy, talented, loving people something happens to Weisler: he slowly, through the ugly process of spying, thaws little by little: Weisler falls in love with them and more to the point.., he falls in love with their lives.<br />First time director, Florien Hinkle von Donnersmarck has produced a remarkable, involving, intelligent film: an intricate, frightening film full of lives caught at the difficult crossroads of patriotism on the one hand and on the other the vortex of individual duty and honor.iter we have who is not subversive,\\" Weisler forces the issue and sets up a full Stasi surveillance: bugs, cameras and sets up a roost for himself in the attic of the Dreyman-Sieland home.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Martin Scorsese always delivers. Great action, great dialouge, great characters, great music.. etc. Yesterday I read three reviews in a row on here that basically said Scorsese should hang it up and called this movie an abundance of negatives.... I think someone should order them a cranberry juice (thats an inside joke if you seen the movie)... today I read three that claim it's better than Goodfellas.<br /><br />The movie was pissah'... comin' straight from a boston bred, I of course ate up every second. I can't say its Scorseses best, but I did fight the hordes of consumah's at Newbury's to buy a copy last Tuesday. Obviously the movie won't win any academy awards, because Scorsese always gets the shaft (remember when Chicago beat out Gangs Of New York...ugggh!) but Scorsese movies ain't made for the academy. Martin Scorsese makes bad ace movies for people who like bad ACE movies. If you like movies that f****in rule, this one is for you... unless you have your period, then maybe you should go order yourself a cranberry juice.<br /><br />Real quick footnote... top notccchhh job on the boston accents. Matt Damon and Mah-ky Mah-k obviously have it in their blood, but Martin Sheen, Leo Dicaprio, and Jack Nicholson really must have worked at perfectin' the speech. Alec Baldwin sort of recycled his Rhode Island accent from back when he did Outside Providence, but he still had the Boston attitude down pretty good. Thumbs up!
B00004RF98|5.0|It has been a long time since I have seen this movie and it really impressed me. I had forgotten how great Donald Oconner was
0446577383|3.0|In this time of anti-Arab sentiment, David Baldacci should be credited here for featuring some muslims capable of acting in less than totally villainous ways. The quality of the writing is certainly adequate to the task of this sort of action novel, and the story steps along briskly.  The plot and the action are a bit implausible, but that's what escapist novels are for, if the implausibility is kept within bounds.  Anyway, the other qualities of the book make it overall a fun read.  The members of the Camel Club are certainly interesting enough to warrant another story.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The dancers were great.  Choreography was good. Good musical overall.  Richard Gere still needs more dancing grace and skill.
0226264211|5.0|Everyone should read this book whatever your political opinions.  Even if you disagree with his positions, it will make you think.  Friedman's Arguments are always clear, original, and thought-provoking.  An excellent read, and surprisingly a page turner.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|Once more, I find it amazing how you put a cute girl behind the microphone, let her breathe in a supposed sexy and sultry voice some superficial words and how massive success just comes.  <br />Even worse, the music is not pop music, but muzak, and they absurdly call this jazz ! <br />

0743298020|1.0|I have to say that I found the imagery very refreshing, as well as the choice of words. Many times it was very nice reading. However, the story makes you wonder \\"so what?\\". This is not a thriller. This is not a ghost story. It's not fantasy. It is a stupid story told with nicely chosen words. I think that the cover is worth more than the words inside.
0743455967|5.0|Thank God for Stephen King! Finally someone who just told me how things are without leaving me feel insecure about my own writing. Such a personal and vivid account of the trade. And so entertaining. It's an auto-biography wrapped in a self help book. A real treasure.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|You may be wondering (as I have) whether the extra price you pay for the Canon brand batteries is worth it.  <br />In my opinion it really is for the following reasons. <br />-Dependability: After a full charge you will get a full day worth of shooting without any problems. The battery holds its charge very well <br />-Consistency: Canon batteries last generally the same amount of time every time you charge them fully. Many generic brands have spotty performance (usually good to start but they go downhill fast) <br />-No worries: Unlike the generic batteries you won't worry about testing the performance of these batteries, personally I'd rather be shooting instead of timing (or worrying about) the generic battery. <br /> <br />And for those who are wondering, this battery works with a number of Canon Digital SLRs. I know for sure that this works with the Canon 5D, 20D and 30D.
B00005JKC3|4.0|i prefer widescreen movies al in all a good movie   delivery was prompt also
0743289412|4.0|Stephan King seems to write three different kinds of stories.  In the first he has excellent character development and the scary parts simply drive the characters (see his short stories).  The second has some character development and a lot of strangeness, creepiness or actual horror but the fear is part of the plot line, not all of it (Carrie, It ) .  The third are the ones when you are reading make you visualize an action/gore blockbuster film and the characters are just there to witness/create/exhibit fear over the horror (Cell).<br /><br />  This book is of the second type.  I enjoyed it FAR more than Cell (which I thought was a tired rewrite).  I liked the psychological creepiness of the book where you are not quite sure in the beginning what is \\"real\\" and what is delusion.  The characters can be somewhat annoying, like real people, but that does make them more three dimensional.<br /><br />  Overall an enjoyable (if somewhat long ) read for those who are looking for entertainment.
B000002LAB|5.0|Tutu is a classic within itself.  Marcus Miller had some wonderful ideas in mind when he wrote this one.  Miles' brilliant trumpet playing just added to the greatness of it.  This was actually the first album I bought of his and since then I started collecting the rest.  I mean, yeah ok the jazz purists may say otherwise but they don't really matter to me.  Great stuff, don't sleep on it.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I am normally long winded, but others have reviewed this perfectly.  For the first time you can feel confident that seeing the movie of your beloved musical will be just as awesome as the original. <br /> <br />I love movies and I love musicals.  However they are completely different.  If I could turn some of my favorite movies into plays or musicals and knew they would be just as good I would and vice versa.  <br /> <br />While more stage productions get reproduced for the silver screen, rarely if ever do they live up to what their predecessor had. <br /> <br />For once there is one... Rent. <br /> <br />The stage production and the movie are different, however they are both equally as amazing. <br />
0792163710|5.0|I remember this movie, when it came to the theaters.  I was just a kid at that time, when Roy Rogers, Gene Autry & all of the other Cowboy Idols were still popular.  It is definitely a Classic among the Westerns.  If you enjoy Westerns & collect the movies, this one should be part of your collection.  Also, Westerns in color were a premium treat back then.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I won't bother to try and convince anyone that The Departed is the better film of the two, I just enjoyed The Departed and its pacing better than Goodfellas which I have always found to be too slow for my tastes...Otherwise....The Departed's cast is at least as strong as any film I have seen in recent years with all members taking their game to the next level and Jack not falling into too many \\"Jack\\" moments and remaining in character MOST of the time...Picking on ANY gangster related film as being derivative of other gangster films is like critiqueing a Western for showing horses and cowboy hats...sorry...but once you are IN a genre you are IN a genre and some similarities are bound to occur...Great use of music as usual in any Marty film...Best American film of '06??  Possibly...certainly better than any \\"mainstream\\" American film I have seen in the past year...
0451163540|3.0|This book was a decent book but i felt that how almost all the characters in the book knew each other was a little to coincidental. <br /> <br />Also some parts of the books seemed rushed as if he was saving pages. I guess this could also be taken for fast moving depending on how you want  to look at it. <br /> <br />For a real good fast paced exciting book i would look to Vince Flynn and his reocurring character Mitch Rapp.
1401302378|5.0|I'm good friends with a jazz musician who had given up hope of making anything with his life. (His dad kept pushing him to get a \\"real job\\" but his true love is music.) Well, I read this book and thought it's information would be perfect for him since, as the book mentions, songs in distinct genres will always sell online. Even the most obscure ones will. I gave him a copy of this book, and he's now inspired to pursue his musical dreams. So, Chris Anderson, if you're reading this, your book has had a life-changing benefit on at least one person.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This movie takes four different story lines, all involving disasters, and weaves them together in pointless tales devoid of character development, plot or purpose. Blanchett and the other cast can't rescue this stinker.  <br /> <br />I don't find it entertaining to watch people getting shot, or in pain, or sinking into disaster, all for no reason and with no redeeming artistic or intellectual value. This film takes you on a long arduous journey without any destination in sight. I cannot believe it got so many Oscar nominations, or that the script attracted this A-list cast.  <br />
B000NA28IE|1.0|Great series of books but a horrible adaptation to film. The Only good thing was the dragon reconstruction, the acting was good..... The Editing was horrible, cutting out every descriptive thing of the characters and their journeys which is what the first story is all about!!!!!!!.
B000LE0THO|5.0|As much as I would love to gush on about this album, I'll let others do that. I can't be objective...it's been one of my fav albums since I was 10. Simply put, this was ELO and Jeff Lynne's high-water mark artistically and production-wise, as well as comercially. If you're a fan, you already own a tattered version. If not...what are you waiting for?<br /><br />Sony Legacy has slowly been issuing the ELO remasters since the turn of the century, with \\"Out of the Blue\\" and \\"Balance of Power\\" (why bother?) being the last two. Why they waited for so long to get their biggest selling album out as a remastwer is beyond me, but the wait has been worth it. This is one of the best remasters I have heard in a LONG time. In fact, although it is not mentioned in the credits, I wouldn't be surprised if there was some minor re-mixing involved. Some may claim sacreledge, but if this is the case, it has worked to this album's favor. The production and sound quality is impeccable, the \\"audio landscape\\" is vastly improved. The seperation of instruments has improved, the bass has serious depth, the highs soar. Twelve-string guitars sound like musical waterfalls (\\"Sweet Talking Woman\\"), the strings sizzle all over. The guitar on \\"Jungle\\" has been boosted a bit, giving the track a power it only hinted at before. The overall sound flows wonderfully with a great balance.<br /><br />Let's put it this way...say you've only ever watched your favorite movie on a small black & white TV. All of a sudden, you get to see it in color on IMAX. This remaster of \\"Out of the Blue\\" is the audio equivalent of that.<br /><br />Jeff Lynne states that this is his favorite of the ELO catalogue, and it certainly shows with this lovingly done remaster. Every ELO fan (or want-to-be fan) and every serious audiophile should have this in their collection. If you've ever owned this album, it's now time to trade up and experience it as if it were the first time.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|On its face it is hard to see how a cinematic treatment of the life of Muhammad Ali (played here by Will Smith), the great prizefighter, could adequately portray the life he actually led. But that is indeed the case here. For those who grew up with him in mid-20th century America it is a nostalgic look back. For those too young to have known his life story this is a good primer of why many considered him one of the greatest athletics of all time and one why, friend or foe, considered him one hell of a man.  <br /> <br />I am not now nor was I then a fight fan. The part of Ali's career that interests me is his fight against black oppression, as he saw it. That in his youth he took a black separatist course joining the Nation of Islam in reaction to the rampart racism in America and American sports is understandable if not strategically the way forward for black liberation. The scenes with Malcolm X, who acted as something of a mentor, are among the best in the film.  <br /> <br />Ali was a man not only with a sports mission but a political mission. That became quite apparent when he, despite damage to his career and to his financial interests, refused to be inducted into the military during the Vietnam War period. His reasoning was simple-he had no quarrel with the Vietnamese. Many lesser figures, who now head the American government, were not nearly so forthright and skipped around the decisive political and moral event of the baby boomer generation. Hats off to Ali. Hats off to a great liberation fighter, who stood up when it counted.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|I thought this movie Iron Man was a great movie. I am into comics and super heros and so I enjoyed this movie very much. I think others will enjoy this movie, especially if they have children and I would recommend this movie to families. It teaches about friendship, loyalty, honor and all that other good moral hero stuff. Its very exciting and enjoyable. Thanks Amazon.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I found this movie to be very informative.  It brought up some interesting points I hadn't heard elsewhere like CO2 emission levels being higher in the winter months for the northern hemisphere because the decidious trees up there don't have their leaves and therefore can't remove CO2.  I also enjoyed the extras on the DVD that include an update from Al Gore about some studies and issues that have arisen since the filming of the movie.  Throughout the film Al does a good job of raising issues and criticisms of global warming and then systematically shows where the criticisims falter.  I found it to be a pretty balanced film, not just a \\"we're doomed\\" show that offers no advice going forward.  While I wouldn't advise that this be your sole source of global warming information, it is always good to have multiple sources, it provides a lot of information to think about in a very convenient manner.  I highly advise watching it.
B0002234LS|4.0|Hey.  Johnny Depp can act.  He basically carries this movie on his back to the promised land of 4/5 star movies.  Thats not to say that the other actors are bad, they are all good, no one stands out as a total [...] job that says he/she is only in it for the money.  A few points on the movie:    First of all this is a horror movie and I was surprised that I was on the edge of my seat.  This is why I contend that PG-13 movies can be just as scary as R rated movies.  The atmosphere is great and I was, like I said, on the edge of my seat.  The biggest thing that helps this movie is the Unknown.  Most R rated movies show you the monster/pysho/math teacher/maniac and take away the element of the unknown(Of course I'm not saying that R rated Horror movies are not scary, I'm just saying that PG-13 movies can be scary too).  In this movie you know the villain is [...] character but you still feel like there is more to it than that and of course there is.    Secondly, this movie also has some good parts in the middle of it.  With a lot of these movies with a big twist at the end the middle can get boring and pointless because the ending is really all that matters.  But Johnny Depp once again comes to the rescue and gives us some good humour which adds to rewatchability.    And finally the ending is, in my opinion, great.  I loved the direction, I loved the acting, yea the story did get a bit uninvolving, but this is still a very good movie which all should see....
0307237699|5.0|This is a great book.  I found myself reading is slowly because I did not want it to end.  Barak shows himself to be a brilliant thinker with his heart in the right place. When I hear one of those commentators say things like \\"but we really don't know what Barak Obama stands for -- he is a blank slate\\"  I feel like asking them if they might find time in their busy schedules to READ HIS BOOK! In it, he lays of in very concrete terms what is wrong, and how to fix it.  He is a true uniter, and that comes through loud and clear. He has the ability to see what is wrong with each side's approach, and how we can (and need to) find common ground to fix the problems facing us.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0000214F0|1.0|I give it 3 stars for porn and -2 stars for a movie, therefore, collectively; you have your single star.  By all means, I suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn, beat off, and then watch a real movie.  Caligula blows literally and royally.  It is a little under 3 hours, which seemed like 3 days, and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film.  The small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn.  The most triumphant scene in the movie is where the Roman soldiers attack the phallus-humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro.  This movie is ridiculous.  In order to enjoy this, one must be completely perverted and dimwitted.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|Shady Records shine's with this release and introduces new artists such as Cashis, Stat Quo and Bobby Creek and brings you classic's from D-12, Eminem, 50 Cent and the whole Shady family.  If your a fan of hip-hop this is a must own.  One of the few cd's you can play the whole way through and not skip a one, Eminem's back.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|Very dissapointed, the story of the Japanese family adds dirt on top of a dead movie. If it wins for Best Picture then Scorecese should shoot himself. If you are having a hard time sleeping watch this. You will be a sleep in no time.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|I have to say that Voila is the best work Belinda has ever done. And did she do some amazing things before... (Real, A Woman and a Man, Runaway Horses, her work with the all girl group The Go-Go's, etc)<br /><br />I bought the album upon it's release 3 weekes ago and the discs hasn't left my cd-player ever since. I just can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Right now I don't speak one word French (but I will soon), but the songs and Belinda's voice touch me more that any music ever did before. And God has this woman touched me before or what.<br /><br />Hightlights for me are Bonnie et Clyde, Avec Le Tamps, Ne Me Quitte Pas, Sous Le Ciel de Paris and La Vie en Rose. But the whole cd is great.<br /><br />At first I was in mourning over the fact that Belinda putted her pop-career in the past, but now, I totally embrace that decision.<br /><br />Belinda developed a 100% French accent in the 13 years she's living in France and sounds like she's a born and raised Franchaise.<br /><br />I hope she will continue recording France albums (standards or new material, I don't really care). I mean, what's left of the pop music we knew 20 years agon, anyway? It hasn't progressed at all.<br /><br />So thank you Belinda for Voila. You go go girl!! ;)<br /><br />Think I'm going to pack my bags and get a one way ticket to France as well.<br /><br />Oh, ciel de Paris!!!
B00005OCMR|3.0|Man's next frontier is inside the digital world of a computer in Disney's Tron, a groundbreaking movie with it's computer animated world within' a computer starring Jeff Bridges as computer genius Kevin Flynn, who is abducted into this civilization he helped create. It's a fantastic & mind blowing experience, a Disney classic, a SC-FI triumph about inner space instead of outer space or time travel. Watch Disney's Tron.

0374105235|5.0|Ishmael's story is truly remarkable in every sense of the word. This book is absolutely a must-read, both for its vividly told story and direct and descriptive style of prose. <br /> <br />His journey reveals a number of vital truths of our world -- the unfortunate realities of war, the ability of good people to perpetuate unspeakable acts, the amazing potential to regain one's humanity against all odds, the bizarre reach of globalized culture, the ways in which our dreams affect intertwine with our realities, and the survival instinct that keeps us alive even in dire circumstances. <br /> <br />While some might say the story ends a bit abruptly, I would commend Ishmael for restraining from the Hollywood ending that audiences often crave; he keeps the focus of the book on the issues at hand, and rightly so. <br /> <br />If anyone ever deserved a chance to write a sequel to his life story, I would say it is Ishmael Beah. And I, for one, can't wait to read it.
B000002MY3|5.0|i bought this cd when i was still in highschool. listened to it religously. learned all the words to every single song on the entire album and all that.  <br />but really for a girl growing up, she was inspiring and i love her true to heart lyrics.  <br />its not pop like the spice girls who were also out around that time.  <br />a decade later i find myself listening to it again with all of the same feelings and love for her music and for specifically this album and the way its brilliantly put together.
0743454537|4.0|I thought this was a great book.  I agree with a lot of what has been said by the other reviewers; I enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down.  But, when I finally got to the much anticipated ending... it was very disappointing.  <br />I really liked the way Picoult used a different perspective in each chapter, taking time to focus on each character's thoughts and feelings.  However, I agree with the reviewers who said that the mother needed more development. I found myself completely hating her and I had hoped that by the end I would be given some insight into her actions, but her character never reveals too much. <br />I was disappointed with the end of the book because I had hoped to see the family work their problems out on their own, and I was interested to see what would happen with the relationshop between Anna and Kate.  <br />***SPOILER ALERT*** <br />But instead, the problem is magically solved by suddenly killing off Anna. I felt like this defeated the purpose of Anna's entire conflict. So overall, My Sister's Keeper is a very good book with a questionable ending.  <br />
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|The movie took me by surprise... despite the fact it had one of my favorite male actors in there, Hugh Grant, I was thinking this was just going to be one silly chick-flick that I'd have to sit through boringly and only went to make my fiancee happy. But as the movie rolled it's intro and I heard the head-bopping drum synthesization of some 80's song I'd never heard before but felt so familiar to... there it was, Hugh Grant singing with a bunch of other random guys, jamming out in some fictional 80's group named \\"PoP!\\" and I became enthralled with the movie and what a way it was to go.<br /><br />ALl of the songs had Hugh singing in them and I was skeptical at first to see that it was really him who was singing all these, my fiancee thinking that he was dubbing to them as well but I kind of had faith in that Hugh was really singing them till I saw the credits, lo and behold, he really was performing each one on his own vocals. AMAZING! All of the songs sang in this movie were very well done in my opinion and have a wide range of variety despite the majority of them being sung by Hugh Grant and Haley Bennett, yet there was such a range it was mesmerizing.<br /><br />You had your typical 80's pop sound, sort of like Duran Duran.<br /><br />(Pop! Goes my Heart)<br /><br />You had your Depeche Mode sounding groove.<br /><br />(Dance With Me)<br /><br />You had an Elton John type sound.<br /><br />(Don't Write Me Off)<br /><br />And then you have a great coupling of other sounds done by the Hugh.<br /><br />The soundtrack is really great if you're looking into a sound that's new in a sense... yet old and familiar for all those great 80's lovers and fans not quite from the era.<br /><br />This soundtrack is a must buy for the movie buffs but music enthusiasts alike.
B00005MP58|2.0|I love Jane Austen, and this film it's ok, but not quite what I expected. Collin Firth's performance is not as good as we are used to nowadays and Jennifer Ehle's doesn't go farther than being smiley through the film. I'm not returning the product, but had I watched it before buying my desicion would be not to buy it
B000683VI4|5.0|Excellent dvd.  My mother really loves it.  It arrived as promised and in great condition.   Amazon is the best place to purchase products like this.

B000HLDFKE|5.0|I'll start out by saying I love this movie! I'm not going to spoil the movie, I just want to say this movie looks beautiful in HD. I had saw it in the theater when it came out, and it was ok. It just seems like HD-DVD just brings movies to life. This is a great fairy tail love story with great acting, (to bad it didn't get recognition at the Academy Awards)with Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves, Chistopher Plummer, and Shohreh Aghdashloo (She's was in Season 4 of 24 on fox). All around great movie, a must buy for the HD-DVD collection.  <br />  <br />
B000NA22C6|1.0|This is an awesome awesome movie. I say that because it is one of the best renditions Hollywood has ever done of a person suffering from \\"psychotic depression.\\" Johnny Depp (who is effected by it) lets the viewer watch this illness evolve in a slow journey down into the dark pit of insanity. The audience experiences this pure psychosis in a fashion that is authentic to the T. <br /> <br />The movie ingeniously shows this form of stress-induced-insanity which is so brilliantly triggered by (1) finding your wife in bed with her boyfriend, (2) the impending divorce, (3) Depp having to move out of his house and into a summer house on a lake, and (4) the inevitable financial stress on this lead character. I mean, oh my god, he must be running about 500 stress points! That's enough to trigger a psychotic attack on anyone who is predisposed to psychotic mental illness (paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar, psychotic depression, post-partum psychosis - about 8 million US people). <br /> <br />This is exactly the type of stress that triggered me to go into an almost identical type of psychotic episode a number of years ago while an army officer assigned to Germany. For me, the stressors were very similar to the movie - move to Europe, new platoon leader, financial difficulties, relationship stress, new language to speak, etc. <br /> <br />Psychosis means delusions and the movie very realistically showed the onset of the \\"persecutorial delusion\\" (where you think someone is coming to get you) by showing Turturro coming to get Johnny. And then the formation of the potentially more serious \\"grandiose delusion\\" where you think that others (real people) are conspiring against you. This is where some psychotic people will actually lash out at others, and by so doing, if they harm them, they become criminally insane. Of the 8 million of us who have this type of psychotic illness, about 50,000 of us will do this. We'll read about the next one in the newspapers next week. Almostall of these will be done by people who did not know they had a psychotic illness, were not previously diagnosed and were not medicated. And this is exactly Depp's situation in the film (I have psychotic bipolar and must take lithium for mania, and Zyprexa for psychosis daily). <br /> <br />Psychosis also means hallucinations. And Turturro has this part by playing an \\"imaginary paranoid hallucination antagonist.\\" This is really an ingenious Hollywood technique because it helps others in our society understand psychosis by showing a visual hallucination. I believe the technique was first used in \\"Beautiful Mind.\\" This phenomenon, coupled with the delusions, is what makes paranoid psychosis a horrifying experience. <br /> <br />The movie shows this paranoid delusional psychosis very well and Depp actually lashes out at a number of people in his psychotic episode. For me, I got these same types of delusions and similar hallucinations in Germany but never lashed out at others - therefore I got an honorable discharge as a captain, after getting out of the stressful situation and the psychosis dissipated. <br /> <br />I liked the above parts of the movie very well for its authenticity - it was good. However what I didn't like about the movie is that it went way over board in the number of homicides. This just adds to the mental illness stereotype and the stigma. And so more people won't go in and get help when they should be getting help and medication. It took me 23 years before I got help. Why? Because of the stigma and fear. Maybe if society didn't have this stigma, we wouldn't have these types of terrible tragedies like in this movie. My heart goes out to anyone who has been impacted by this. <br /> <br />Society has available the medicine and counseling which is needed to eliminate this type of tragedy. Maybe if they educated the masses in a smart way we could eliminate it. But instead we \\"monsterize\\" this illness by this type of movie.
B000055ZB8|5.0|That old silent film is of course a classic. It comes from the German school of horror films in the 1920s. It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is  quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard.<br /><br />The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the [..] crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ?<br /><br />The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people.<br /><br />The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations.<br /><br />The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque. It is just expressive enough to mean what it is supposed to mean without any negative second level reading.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

6305907145|1.0|I was extremely disappointed and shocked to the point of returning the item for less then a full refund because of it's racey content. It was listed as similar to \\"Sense & Sensibility\\"  and \\"Emma\\", but I found it to be quite the opposite. This could've been rated R for the sexual content, which was the entire focus of this movie (which I couldn't complete watching because I was so offended), compared to the previously mentioned movies, which were G and very innocent, the topics covered mainly Victorian courtship and the plight of women. I would not recommend this to anyone.

1883217040|5.0|I knew very little about jazz theory before purchasing this book.  Just the first 20 pages made it much easier to wrap my head around everything being discussed in my jazz class.  A must buy for everyone from the jazz hobby-est to the profession-seeker.
6305307261|5.0|A remake of Murnau's Nosferatu. It speaks and it is full of colour. Very standard remake but a few changes are difficult to explain. For instance Mina and Lucy are inverted and Jonathan is married to Lucy. It may be Bremen but it looks like Amsterdam but with the sea next door. We have the same idea of a plague. But the director takes liberty with this plague and seems to organize at the end of it some kind of open air festivity and Last Supper for the survivors soon to be dead anyway. Morbid in other words. Herzog keeps the ending in which Lucy sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to make him trespass the cock's crowing line. And she succeeds. A vampire in love is thus very silly and selfless enough to forget his survival instinct. But Herzog doubles up the ending with a good stake planted in Dracula's heart, but in the wings, and the arrest of Van Helsing for the murder of Dracula. He will be tried sooner or later. But the best change is that Lucy is dead and Jonathan has completed his transformation and has become a full-fledged vampire and we recapture the ending of the original where the danger of a next generation was left open. Here it is clearly stated and we see Jonathan crossing Europe again on horseback probably to go to his castle in Transylvania. The main interest of the film is not there. The main interest is in the phenomenal actors used for the main three characters and of course the absolutely astounding make-up of these actors. In other words, make-up added, this film recaptures the phenomenal body language and body expressivity of the old Murnau's film. It explains the fact that it does not seem to have very rich dialogues. It is all happening in the movement and syntax of the bodies on the screen.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
B00006DEF9|5.0|<br />Singing in the rain is probably the highest quality DVD I've ever had. Its luscious, saturated colour, enchanting songs, performances of the dedicated talents and wonderful script all make it a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br />The trivia behind the scenes are actually equally amazing. Special salute to Debbie Reynolds (19 year-old then) who danced and sang her heart out to meet high expectations, suffered great fatigue and feet injury after numerous takes. Story had it that Debbie Reynolds, after being told that she was not able to dance, had the advice and help from Fred Astaire to pull it off. To Donald O'Connor, at the age of 27, who still ran up the wall and performed a somersault, repeated the demanding act several times on screen, only to be hospitalised and later found he had to do it all over again after the film negatives were lost in a fire. To the uncredited choreographers who also dubbed the tap dance. Behind the glorious feeling and sunny mood of the film were total dedication and committment of these admirable talents. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won my sympathy as the self-conscious arrogant but stately star from the silent film era. It's no concidence her sharp voice echoed that of Judy Holiday in Born Yesterday. Jean was Judy's understudy in Born Yesterday the stage play. It's easy to get all the glory for being the leading role, yet Jean hagen and Donald O' Connor should win high praise for making the picture complete. The more I watched the movie again, the more I admire their work. Gene Kelly had a fever when performing the title song. <br /> <br />One last point, Don Lockwood (Howard Keel), Cosmo (Oscar levant), Lina Lamont (Judy Holiday) - these were people once considered for the parts. Singing in the Rain manifested the glory of film making as well as the high demands and commitment of people, on and off screen, to churn out  work of such high quality. Hats off to their hard work!

6305358613|4.0|Cate Blanchett does a terrific job as Elizabeth, transitioning from young naive woman to hard, distanced monarch. And the rest of the cast stands up to the challenge of their roles as well. It's great to see a cast consisting of Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush, Kelly McDonald, Joseph Fiennes, and the old guy from Jurassic Park (come on, what's his name again?). All of these actors together with the scene design and cinematography really help bring this period piece to life.<br /><br />Sometimes the plot gets so thick it's hard to follow the story. And with a cast of so many characters it's easy to forget who's being talked about and where their allegiences lie.<br /><br />The DVD does feature a making of featurette and another brief featurette on Elizabeth herself. Overall, it's definitely worth the two hours to check out a great story, and a great film.

But, guess what, the book will basically say the same thing every other book says in a fancy dressed up way: Eat less, Move more! Deep down, they already knew it, but someone IMPORTANT is telling them so they'll follow the advice and think wow! This book's great!  Same stuff here, someone close to me recommended it and I promised I'd read it.  Well, save your money (self-help is a money machine, too) and I'll break it down very simply: <br />1. What goes around comes around (origin, \\"don't know\\") <br />2. Do unto others as as you'd have done to you (origin, \\"Bible?\\") <br />3. Think happy thoughts (origin \\"Peter Pan\\") <br />4. If you build it they will come (origin \\"Field of Dreams\\") <br />5. Seek and ye shall Find (origin \\"Bible?\\") <br />6. Ask and ye shall receive (origin \\"Bible\\") <br />Just live by these 6 phrases, and save your 15 bucks.
0374105235|5.0|Reading this book is a practice of deep and lasting heartbreak. It is the most vivid reminder I have ever read that the hidden costs of war that we never hear about ALWAYS outweigh any benefit that might come from the conflict. This is the most moving story I have ever read. <br /> <br /> It was amazing at how mature Beah's voice and style are as a first-time author. I also saw him speak last week in NYC, and was amazed at his poise and presence. I hope he is the future president of Sierra Leone. I look forward to more of his work and recommend this book as highly as I can to EVERYONE. Although it may be tough to stomach some of what he describes, the beauty never wanes. We should all have to face this book if we want to understand what really happens in war.
0156027321|5.0|Good book...the reader learns new perspectives on faiths and a lot about animals and zoos...but most of all, after reading this book, the reader learns about himself or herself...How the reader considers the end of the book, which story he or she wants to believe, is a revelation of how the reader wants to see the world in which we live...    Good  book, very well done.  Easy to see why it is considered a classic so  soon after it was written.  The gist of this book stands with the basic question we struggled with in grade school or junior high and, for that matter, all of our lives: \\"Given choices, which door did he choose? And what came out, the lady or the Tiger?  Your answer will tell you about yourself, perhaps about parts you previously had not explored.

B000069HK2|5.0|If I had to recommend a 'The Used' cd to anyone, it would be this one. This CD gets you pumped right from the beginning. It's one of thoes brilliant albums where you just dont want to miss a track. You can tell that The Used put all of their heart into this record. The lyrics, the melodies and the screaming are all so amazing. I HIGHLY recommend this album for any fan of The Used!!
1401207138|5.0|I rarely run across a graphic work that is truly excellent.<br /><br />This is one of them.<br /><br />This is not a story of superheroes , per-say.<br /><br />It is a story of how flaws drive people, how flawed characters can still produce good among the evil they struggle with.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the symbolism and use of imagery.<br /><br />Dr Manhattan is an obvious symbol of God, with thoughtful and realistic portrayal.<br /><br />At one point a character brutally murders a Vietnamese woman who is carrying his child while standing right next to the Dr. Arguably one of the most horrible things a person is capable of. After the character asks Manhattan why he didn't stop him if he knew it was going to happen? Manhattan doesn't even respond. But you understand that it is not his responsibility to interfere in the lives of men unless asked to. He doesn't cause evil, but he doesn't prevent it. The evil of men exists apart from God.<br /><br />The different characters are painted with a dirty and human brush and ring true in their actions and words.<br /><br />You don't need to try and analyze the plot and symbolism to get the most out of the Watchmen, but I feel that you miss out on much of the nuance if you do not.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. First of all, I wasn't crazy about the first \\"Saw\\", but \\"Saw 2\\" was really good, and most importantly for me the 2 tied in together. I hate it when they make a sequel and it has absolutely nothing to do with the first film. Not to say that this movie has nothing to do with the first 2 films, I'm just merely stating that I hate when they make movies like that in general. Anyway, deep down inside I knew this would stink, I guess I was just curious, and I had a little extra cash to splurge. Anyone who is familiar with the \\"Saw\\" movies know that you can expect a huge twist at the end. However, in this film, the end is where it fell flat. I guess if you like endings where everybody dies, and nothing is solved, then you'll like this. I felt like it was sort of cliffhangerish (if that's even a word). I don't see how there can be another sequel, but we all know they'll find a way even if it's a copycat to carry on the Jigsaw's work. At any rate, I think another sequel is pretty much a guarantee. This movie is just meaningless gore and unecessary violence with a horrible ending that managed to destroy the first 2 movies for me. American filmakers need to understand that you can't rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace  the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the concepts though. I do think it was pretty sick to do brain sugery on someone with power tools while their still awake. That was a good scene for me, but that's about it. Needless to say, don't waste your time waiting on the big payoff because you'll be disappointed.
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast! The best of the best, this is my fourth copy of this CD, it never gets old at all, you can put in ATLiens and just ride out all day, all night! 13th Floor/Growing Old, that's some real stuff this whole CD is real, this is when Outkast was not concerned about being politically correct or appealing to everbody i.e. the pop community. This is probably their greatest CD ever, it actually a toss up between Aquemini and this one. You will not be disappointed with this at all! This is their best works here!
0761129235|5.0|Excellent easy read, yet with solid science. Dismantles common assumptions about personal and coroporate change and success. Validation for taking things easier and simpler without the stress of feeling that you're not doing enough.  Not pop psychology, but solid, practical, useful science in a most reader friendly format.
B00005JPCD|4.0|While I thought that there was a space in there that got tiresome with respect to the \\"save the environment\\" message, my kids loved this movie.  They are 20, 12 and 6 and they all thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is entertaining.  They loved the songs and the dancing.  The older ones even loved the part where he is in the zoo and gets the attention of his \\"captors.\\"  And my younger son, couldn't stop dancing.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I actually like this movie overall, I just have a few complaints, so bare with me. First of all, I wanna say this cast is amazing. Of course, we all know Jack Nicholson always delivers the goods, but Matt Damon, Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Walhberg were absolutely amazing as well. This movie is full of star power. However, with that being said, this is a typical \\"gangster\\" movie. They all pretty much follow the same formula. There's always the head \\"gangster\\" that the star Cop or the F.B.I wanna bring down, but they can't seem to make anything stick. There's the classic mole which could be anybody from a Cop to a D.E.A agent trying to infiltrate the organization as a Narc. You have a lot of unnecessary foul language. There were points in this movie where the language just got worse and worse for absolutely no reason. Don't get me wrong, my ears are nowhere near sensitive, but some of that stuff was just way over the top. Again, that's always classic \\"gangster\\" movie fashion. This was a good movie, but nothing special by any means. I know I'm not the only one who noticed that Leonardo Dicaprio's accent kinda comes and go's the entire movie. Frankly, I don't think any of the actors pulled off a believable Boston accent throughout the film. I am glad that Mark Walhberg got his much deserved nod from the Academy for his role. It's about time too because I've loved Mark Walhberg for a long time. I also want the Academy to go ahead and give Leonardo Dicaprio the award they have been trying to give him for so long now. At any rate, this a good movie, but I wasn't dazzled. I guess I was looking for the \\"WOW FACTOR\\" Just keep in mind while watching this movie D.T.A (Don't Trust Anybody). That's all I'll say to keep from spoiling the ending.
B000089RVX|5.0|This music is so unique and her voice so...what's the word?  Haunting?  Enchanting?  I'm not sure but it's a very original sound and although Bring Me to Life is the reason I bought this, (and it would be worth it just for that song) I think the CD as a whole is very good. The songs are very stirring.
B00011KHTM|4.0|This adaptor will connect a VGA projector or monitor to an intel iMac or MacBook, but the older flat panel iMac and iBook have a port which looks nearly identical, but is actually miini-VGA, and this adaptor will not fit.  I also do not think the comment about a higher price at the Apple store is correct, at least the online store.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  I had never seen it before, but had liked the previews on tv.  The show is engaging; the characters are real and the situations hold your attention.  This is a must for someone who likes drama series.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|Just as ELDORADO and A NEW WORLD RECORD are ELO's SGT. PEPPER and REVOLVER, respectively, and OUT OF THE BLUE their WHITE ALBUM, FACE THE MUSIC is their answer to RUBBER SOUL, and it's even better now that it's been remastered and had bonus cuts added. The opener, \\"Fire On High\\", was a big interpretive dance number for me- why it was never included on any anthology is anyone's guess, but now you get it in full digital glory. The other best songs here are the hard rocker \\"Poker\\", the psychedelic love song \\"Strange Magic\\", and the scathing \\"Evil Woman\\", which anyone who's seen the play or movie ANNIE would say is about the character of Miss Hannigan. I haven't heard the bonus cuts, but they provide a new window into ELO's creative process.

0385720920|4.0|in such a weird, crazy, strange, perverted kind of way.   <br /> <br />But then its also kind of sad in a similar kind of way.  A really great read, but it does, at least to me, point out a sort of emptiness...a lack of something in the world, to the point that it made me at least feel content that it wasn't just me.  Not that I'm sure that what I just said makes sense, but I don't like to edit my thoughts -- but yes, anyway, this is a great book to read over a couple days.   <br /> <br />Its certainly f-ed up, and it certainly gives you a little bit to think about for a while...before you set it down and get back to yourself.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|Just as ELDORADO is ELO's SGT. PEPPER, FACE THE MUSIC their RUBBER SOUL, and OUT OF THE BLUE their WHITE ALBUM, A NEW WORLD RECORD is their REVOLVER. This album is a great blend of hard rock, pop, and classical, with highlights being \\"Livin' Thing\\", \\"Telephone Line\\", \\"So Fine\\", and \\"Do Ya\\"; however, there's other great stuff on this CD as well, and the bonus cuts help provide a window into the creative process behind ELO's best work.
6304907648|5.0|The storytelling and acting are superb in this 1995 thriller which I recently watched again.  Hunter and Weaver shine.  Mulroney's role, especially, fits him like a glove as evidenced by his natural and seemingly effortless portrayal of Hunter's character's partner.  This superb actor makes it look easy and he deserves more recognition than he gets. Special features include a voiceover behind-the-scenes guide by director Amiel, which is wonderfully informative and enlightening regarding his technique.  A gotta see!
B0000C9JFO|4.0|Despite the sinister European Union funding of this film (there is no doubt that it promotes an unrealistically rosy view of European integration), it is an extremely enjoyable viewing experience. <br />The acting is good, lines are witty, and the dialogue is equally amusing in English, Spanish or French. <br /> <br />I recommend a purchase!
B000060OFT|5.0|I have never known what Shakespeare was ever talking about. To me it was just a bunch of gibberish. But this movie is awesome I actually get what they are saying and all the details you miss while reading the play. Not to mention Leonardo DiCaprio is SOOOOO hot in this movie! Especially with wet hair!
1582701709|5.0|\\"The Secret\\" is a precious gem to all those who read the book or watch the DVD. Reading through the pages and following the suggestions will cause a dramatic change in one's life. So many times we think we have no control over situations. \\"The Secret\\" dispels that myth. According to the Laws of Attraction, we do have control over certain events, etc., that come our way. Through the power of thought to transform and heal we can make positive changes in our lives. The \\"secret\\" has always been a law of the universe. Many people didn't realize its ultimate power.     Studies have shown that athletes who visualize succeeding in events and competitions have a greater victorious outcome than those who don't apply this law of nature. What we think and believe in our minds we can achieve. This is a law of the universe. I've used this principle for many years in my life and the results have been astounding.     I think this book will be a boon to those who are battling diseases, competing in sports events, improving self-image, losing weight, and particularly for anyone who is reaching for a specific goal in life. It's a supportive book for young people as well who are struggling with despair, depression, or anxiety. It's more than a panacea. It's real...and will help change your life! The image or outcome we focus on in our minds can certainly become a reality. Today, so many people don't believe in their power to succeed. Many give up too quickly. This book will help change their attitude. By focusing on the \\"desired\\" results causes positive changes in the brain.      Just when you think all hope is lost, you can help turn your life around by the information in this book. I highly recommend \\"The Secret,\\" and see how it transforms \\"your\\" life. I know it transformed mine.    Nancy A. Draper (Author)[[ASIN:141845107X A Burden of Silence: My Mother's Battle with AIDS]]
0385486804|4.0|Very entertaining for about 3/4 of the way in, lost interest at the end.  Finished the book in about 2.5 days.
B000M341QE|3.0|Eventhough this movie is watchable it has many flaws. I know that the characters in this movie are bad people well except the Martin Sheen character. Bad or not i did not feel anything for these characters. In other Scoresse movies the were filled with bad people these people atleast were entertaining. Joe Pesci was very evil in Goodfellas and Casino but at least he was entertaning the same can be said for other parts like Bill the butucher from Gangs or New York, Rupbert Pumkin from king of comedy, and countless other baddies in Scorsses other better movies. <br /> Spoiler alert: All of the leads except Walberg die and Walberg kills Mat Damons character.When the were killed i did not fell anything. This movie is so forgetable that i cant even remeber the characters names. The other thing that bugs me about this movie is how the characters especially's Walbergs character use gay slurs to insult people. If this movie did not have this cast and director behind it no one would care. Also why does Scorsse keep puting Leo Dicrapo in his movie he needs to go back with Deniro the star of all his good movies. Atleast he did not do another movie like the snore fests The Avaitar or Age of Innoncence he is at his best with Deniro and a Rated R movies with violence and cussing stuff this movie has plenty off but so what when the characters are boring and the script is just a remake of another movie.
1582701709|5.0|So many people claim that \\"The Secret\\" is too simplistic, and to some it may be. However I find that so many people are really missing the point here! It's not just about positive thinking.....it's also about negative thinking!  Most of us live our lives not realizing that our negative thoughts do us more damage than we can imagine. But because of Rhonda Byrnes reviving this old subject, she has made people aware of the power we have in our thoughts and how we can train ourselves to change the negative to positive.  Surely we all should want to do that! And btw, if you doubt that negative thoughts have any impact on us, check with some of the medical articles about how anger, envy, resentment, stress, etc., have a very strong impact on our health.  \\"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he\\"....a quote from the bible. <br />I found the dvd and the book to be a gift to humanity! Now, if people will take it and use it for what it was intended, they will surely be blessed. So don't concern yourself with whether it's 'New Age' or some way-out philosophy, just \\"Seek and ye shall find\\". You may be very surprised at what you find out about yourself. We probably all need a wake up call!
B00005LKHW|1.0|This may be one of the most over-rated movies of the last 20 years.  It is typical mindless skirt chasing by high school boys.  How many times will this premise be used before people stop watching it??  Please god stop. <br /> <br />Thank you

No pude resistir la tentaci&oacute;n de comprarlo pensando que si todo el CD era como esa canci&oacute;n, ser&iacute;a un &eacute;xito y as&iacute; fue. Excelente!
B00006AFUR|5.0|I bought this CD after I purchased their sophomore effort `A Beautiful Lie' which is a great album. I was so intrigued with the music I wanted to find out what else was out there. What I found was this CD (Self Titled - 30 Seconds to Mars) sounded nothing like the second and if you ask me a much better production. It's difficult to pin their music in a box, but well worth a listen. I'm a huge music fan and I have yet to come across a similar sound. As this group finds its voice this album will be a classic.
B0000669JL|5.0|Being a HUGE Marley fan the LEGEND CD is by far one of his best works.  I own several CD's of his from real early stuff to later music and this CD I call my \\"feel good\\" music.  It will be played at our 25th wedding aniversary in St. Thomas this April!!!!!  Anyone who purchases this will definitely enjoy listening to it.
0385335997|4.0|I am reading the entire series of the Jamie and Claire Fraser saga.  They tell a thrilling tale of love and adventure.  In the first two books there was a tremendous amount of violence with graphic details of the results, but it was readable and believeable happenings of an 18th Century era of violence and war.  Although the Voyager had many laugh out loud scenes I found much of the violence and gore to be unnecessary and over the top.  It seemed Ms. Gabaldon was testing the limits of unpleasant, gory scenarios.  I will say her writing is just as descriptive of the countryside of Scotland and the islands the couple  visited in the Voyager.  I found the graphic descriptions of carnage and bodily functions too much and unnecessary for the story.
B000J103YI|4.0|This is an excellent distallation of the main songs from the movie. The voices are just so incredibly powerful. Good stuff.
B000N6TX1S|5.0|This is perhaps the most satisfying movie I've seen in fifteen years, maybe longer.  Yes, that sounds melodramatic, especially coming from someone who considers himself a lifelong movie buff. But in all sincerity, this is the first film to come along that's capable of challenging Blade Runner's claim to \\"All-time Best Dystopian Sci-Fi Masterpiece.\\"<br /><br />But Children of Men is more than bleak scenery and overcrowded squalor. The visual style employed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and his talented cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki) forces you to experience the story in purely visceral terms. You are there. You cannot escape the scenes. Long takes (often extremely long) are used effectively to trap the audience in the middle of the action. The result: some of the most harrowing urban images ever committed to film. In many ways, this movie does for current global conflicts what Apocalypse Now did for the Vietnam War, or Black Hawk Down for Somalia, employing a \\"you-are-there\\" style to put the viewer in the hot seat.<br /><br />And this film isn't even about war, ostensibly, but a single woman's pregnancy! While the plot may follow a rather simple progression at times, the tension is nail-biting, the acting is first rate, and the plot structure rich and imaginative. Children of Men has a lot to offer. If you're like me, it will change the way you watch movies. You will feel like you've been punched in the gut for two hours straight, but the experience is unforgettable.  Truly brilliant filmmaking.<br /><br />This is my first ever Amazon review. Hope it was helpful.
1845761502|5.0|If you are a serious movie buff and you really enjoy \\"digging-in\\" to movies beyond just watching them, then you must get this book. It is rather large and heavy but contains great articles and loads of pictures on special effects and yes it covers movie favs like the Terminator and Alien series. This book comes highly recommended to movie fans by a movie fan.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Alright.  This may be a bridge too far, but here's my attempt at intellectualizing why we old folks are so quick to say that \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" sucks in comparison with BSSM.  I think it's all about context.  When we were kids, hanging out and making out, music was the constant soundtrack of our lives; we listened to it in the context of all the fun stuff we were doing and we built connections to it organically.  Now when the Peppers put out a new record we give it a listen when we can squeeze in a moment.  We often do this absent of any context other than sitting and waiting for a 30 second sample on Amazon or through nasty greasy headphones at the local bookstore.  Sometimes we might throw it on in our home stereos and listen to 15 seconds of each song as we impatiently skip track-by-track looking for the \\"Funky Monks\\" intro.  Then we get disappointed by our experience and blame the band.<br /><br />Maybe it's a serious wake-up call.  Create context to listen naturally.  Hang out...Make out (with your spouse, even!).  I love \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", but only recently...only after I created a space and context.  When I first heard the Chili Peppers I was happy and felt free, enlightened, and natural.  Those moments aren't reserved just for kids!
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|I bought this movie because a friend of mine was in it, and everyone I know that saw it begged me to watch it, so I reluctantly did because it was 2.5 hours long. I didn't even notice how long it was because I was so drawn in right up until the last minute, and that almost never happens (Lord of the Rings: Return of the King?). People love to nitpick and say \\"it wasn't original\\", but every movie at this point is going to be moderately similar to something else. I don't know what they expect. It's a fantastic movie, and definitely deserves a spot on your shelf.
6305781427|5.0|The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and was in perfect shape.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Wow! This move had it all. Romance, drama, murder, thrills, double crossing, and even a little sci-fi. Just when you think you have EVERYTHING figured out another twist is thrown at you. It'll keep you guessing till the end. It has something for everyone including a feel good ending at which point you realize who the true antagonist is. <br /> <br />Definitely a must see. Great cinematography and acting!! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPKC|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />If the closing credits didn't identify Clint Eastwood as the director of \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" you might be forgiven for believing you were watching an actual Japanese war film like \\"Burmese Harp\\" or \\"Fires on the Plain\\" - not merely because the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles but because the movie has a starkness of vision and an intimacy of scope uncharacteristic of mainstream American movie-making. This is Eastwood's flip-side companion piece to the earlier \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" which told the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the American point of view. For this film, Eastwood has shrunk his canvas considerably, populating it with fewer familiar faces and restricting the action almost entirely to the island itself. Indeed, it is this very air of claustrophobia that makes \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" a more cohesive, personal and meaningful work than the earlier fine film.<br /><br />As the movie begins, the Japanese army is preparing for an American assault on the island. The film focuses on two main characters, one from the upper echelons of the military and one from the grunt class. The former is Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a Lieutenant General who is sent to the site to take command of the forces for the battle to come. Kuribayashi is a compassionate pragmatist who has to deal not only with the enemy battering away at the island with the relentless fury of heavy artillery but the suicidal tendencies of his own men, many of whom subscribe to the belief that it is more honorable to commit hara-kiri than to endure the ignominy of defeat or surrender. The common soldier's eye view is provided by Saigo, a private reluctantly drafted into the army, who would much rather be back at home with his wife and baby daughter than digging trenches on some godforsaken rock in the middle of nowhere, and who feels less eager than his compatriots to sacrifice his life in service of his country.<br /><br />By limiting their scope, Eastwood and screenwriter Iris Yamashita - working from the actual letters Kuribayashi and others sent home from the island - show us the horrors of war on a more personal scale than we generally find in films of this type. We come to identify with the desperation felt by 20,000 soldiers trying to fend off a force of 100,000 without benefit of naval or air support, virtually assured that none of them would ever make it off the island alive.

B000G75AE8|5.0|SLAYER---Christ Illusion <br /> <br />Now the reason for the title, is because i think this album has more in common with Hell Awaits & South of Heaven than Reign in Blood or Seasons in the Abyss. I have been a loyal Slayer Follower since Reign In Blood (so for all of you younglings out there that was 1986), i had to go back to Haunting, Show & Hell Awaits. <br /> <br />Anyhow, where Reign & Seasons are albums that come along once in a band's career Slayer has 2, this is not saying that SOH & HA aren't classics because they are, the 4 album arc from HA to SITA will never be matched by any metal band again in history. <br /> <br />Christ Illusion has the same lyrical innovation that the band exhibited on HA & the slow heaviness with speed that was eveident on SOH. songs like \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" could have easily appeared on either HA, SOH or SITA, where as songs like \\"Supremist\\" could have easily been on RIB. <br /> <br />I recently saw Slayer on the CI tour at the 9:30 Club in D.C. & the songs from CI sound even better & tighter live. this album fits so well in with their classics that when Dave returned it was as if no time had passed. <br /> <br />Paul was a great drummer for his time in the band, but guess what folks HE'S NOT DAVE LOMABARDO!!!! there is & always will be only 1 metal drum god & that is DAVE!!!! <br /> <br />As for the people who want Jeff to start writing again, well he co-wrote 3 songs on the album & has said in interviews that he now prefers touring to recording & Kerry said that with Dave back in the fold he wanted to get back to a traditional SLAYER album & i think they more than accomplished that feat. <br /> <br />For those who want a taste of NEW SLAYER with Dave get this album, but having said that let it be a window to some of the best damn metal albums ever made!!! HAUNTING THE CHAPEL, SHOW NO MERCY, HELL AWAITS, REIGN IN BLOOD, SOUTH OF HEAVEN & SEASONS IN THE ABYSS!!!! <br /> <br />yes & you can add CHRIST ILLUSION to that list as well, because it is this headbagers opinion that in time it will come to be a classic as well!!! <br /> <br />BUY IT NOW OR KERRY WILL BE ANGRY!!!!
B000M341QE|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />In Martin Scorcese's \\"The Departed,\\" Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling \\"moles\\" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law.  Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a \\"rat\\" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations.<br /><br />The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick \\"Infernal Affairs,\\" finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence.  In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director.  Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, \\"The Departed\\" falls short of the \\"Goodfellas\\" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.<br /><br />On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion.  In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles.  Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don`t mind watching it yet another time.<br /><br />The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion.  There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side.  One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film`s success.<br /><br />Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in \\"The Departed\\" - a kind of unity and focus that turned \\"Goodfellas\\" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre.  The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art.  The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in \\"The Verdict\\").  The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against \\"Goodfellas.\\"  Moreover, even the violence in \\"The Departed\\" is handled much less effectively than it was in \\"Goodfellas.\\"  In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in \\"The Departed,\\" the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.<br /><br />Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to \\"Goodfellas,\\" a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of filmmaking.  It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product.<br /><br />A good film but not a great one.ar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product.   <br /> <br />A good film but not a great one.
B0002JP4L4|4.0|I would give it five stars if the story of the movie wouldn't be a little lame (a little town where there is no music and dancing allowed - hello?)The dancing and the music make up for the story line though. A nice movie to pop into your DVD player once in a while.
0792163710|5.0|George Stevens uses just about every cliche in western film. Sodbusters versus cattlemen. The lone stranger riding in from parts unknown. Ultimate good (Alan Ladd as Shane) versus ultimate bad (Walter Jack Palance as Jack Wilson). One hero against a bunch of baddies. Yet it works. And how. The scenery, the Tetons, is magnificent.  <br />Nearly everyone now recognizes this as a classic. Yet, the bigwigs at Paramount thought so little of it, they shelved it for two years before releasing it during a lull in production (according to TCM). <br />Belongs on every list of 5 top westerns.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Listening to Boston:  Boston and Boston:  Don't Look Back is like taking a trip back in time.  As a teenager in the late 1970's, Boston was the background music of our lives - along with Genesis, Kansas, Supertramp, Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Alan Parsons Project...<br /><br />But just listening to any of the songs from Boston's two defining albums takes me back.  Boston's sound was distinctive, all their own.  Brad Delp was the voice behind the band, and what a voice it was! Coupled with the soaring harmonies from the guitars of Tom Scholz, Boston had a sound all its own, a sound that will instantly transport you back to your teen years.<br /><br />If you're getting to know Boston for the first time around, I recommend Boston and Don't Look Back.  Beyond that, though, Boston's trademark classic rock sound is watered down by the intermittent usage of lesser lead vocalists and weaker material.<br /><br />Boston and Don't Look Back are both perfect examples of what rock and roll used to be, before disco and rap.  Boston is the definition of classic rock.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|Fans of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves will get a treat with The Lake House, a beautiful, romantic and mysterious picture about finding the right love at the wrong time -- or so it would seem. The premise of the movie --two people who live in the same house in separate years and manage to fall in love despite their chronological distance--is quite intriguing and works out well. The chemistry between Bullock and Reeves is, once again, great. I really enjoyed The Lake House and think you will too.
B000001ELD|4.0|Gene Simmons once again proves that he is not your average rock god!  My favorite track off of this album is \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\".  It is a very eclectic mix of music styles, but is definitely worth a listen.

B0000028PL|4.0|LC defined funky hard rock. They produced such a great, bouncy yet rockin' debut that they owned funk rock circa 1988. Type had explored some of the possibilities opened by Vivid but was a little fragmented despite the hits. On Stain we get a third album in a row with it's own flavour. This album is the darkets of the bands early phase. More succint and focussed than Times Up, the bounce squeezed out of it to leave the listener with their most metal release. Whether the departure of Muzz Skillings to be replaced by Doug Wimish had anything to do with this, well it's perhaps useless to speculate.<br /><br />What is obvious is that here the funk takes a back seat. Instead this album hits the listener over the head with an iron bar. From opening opus Go Away through Ignorance is Bliss, Leave it Alone, Bi, Mind Your Own Business... heck all the album up to track #8 - Nothingness, is just one rocker after the next. Top stuff, but a bit of a shock to their fans, the close feeling of the arrangements, Vernon Reid crunching riff after riff out of his instrument, really proving he was an versatile axesmith and not just reliant on feedback for his sound. All through the album Glover sings like someone just spilled his pint and he's not thrilled. Sure there is still some humour such as in Bi but it's 'ha ha got you' humour rather than  party slapstick fun kind of stuff.<br /><br />The later parts of the album are also dense such as WTFF and This Little Pig not to mention the mellow yet claustrophobic, practically spoken work Hemp. And don't expect a repeat dose of Love Rears it's Ugly Head either. Oh there is a whimsical sounding tune - it's called Nothingness. Play this a few times in a darkened room and the whimsical element will give way to a darker set of emotions.<br /><br />This is a pretty meaty hard rock cum metal album. And unlike many bands this is one bunch of guys who got heavier as they aged. Don't believe the aura of 'downer' that seems to surround this album. View this slice of riff heavy wattage as part of an overall LC catalogue and you'll find plenty to enjoy here. Pity about the (yet another) crap cover but it is a little more indicative of what's going on musically I suppose.um.

B00005JLIU|3.0|I bought this DVD because Bea Lillie was in it.  I remembered her from 50's tv and thought she was funny.  She was a disappointment.  Okay, the movie was supposed to be a spoof, but it had so many cliches that it was not enjoyable.  However, Julie Andrews sang and looked beautiful, and Mary Tyler Moore danced and also looked beautiful.  And it is fun to see them in younger days.

B000E1ZBH2|4.0|If you are looking for Jane Austen's beautiful book translated faithfully to film, this is not the movie for you. But this adaptation `Pride & Prejudice' is wonderfully done. This movie has great casting, good writing and good direction. I did enjoy watching this shorten version of the film even though some subplots do not even exits in this movie. It would be impossible to place all that Jane Austen has going on in her novel into two-hour movie.    One thing the director did do is film everything from the view of Elizabeth Bennet, played by Keira Knightly. And the dance hall scenes and social etiquette were accurate for the time period chosen, 1797. You could see what a middle-upper class family had to go through if they had daughters. I also thought that Matthew Macfadyen played a captivating Mr. Darcy and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, though looking soft spoken and soft on Elizabeth, and it showed he did marry for love.    The scenery and music are highlights of the movie. This is a movie many will see more then once. Though Elizabeth Bennet in this movie seems to have more modern sensibilities then the book gives her, Keira knightly still does well. Especially considering every woman that has ever read this books has her own view on the character. But the chemistry you feel from the screen form Elizabeth and Darcy jumps out at you, there string love suppressed by misunderstandings and preconceived notions.... if I might be so bold as to say, their Pride & Prejudice.    This book is a masterpiece and sets the standard for all romantic novels, so no movie could ever stand up to its standard. But for a two-hour entertaining movie, it was very good.
B000CNESU8|4.0|NETWORK took a giant leap in an interesting, necessary direction by illustrating flaws foreseen by Edward R. Murrow on the corruptibility of the interaction of our government, our press, and our corporations.  The film permits us to focus on individual personalities who are usually cloaked in the twilight zone of an edutainment corporation as they sink to new (lower) common denominators in their careers and private lives. <br />I believe THE INSIDER and STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP have addressed many of these challenging concerns far more effectively, but NETWORK was checking these doors long before RealiTV was released on its own loonytunes recognizance.   <br />This film is certainly worthy of a closer look.  The extras are diverting yet equivocal, but that's because the problems addressed were less recognizable (low-resolution) then than they are now.  NETWORK predicted a disturbing quality of reportage that continues to devolve, corporate control of impartial voices of reflection, and the ultimate victory of the 100% cardboard television executive whose critical \\"judgment\\" is an oxymoron in all senses of the word \\"critical\\". <br />In NETWORK, love is never having to be reasonable nor responsible, just accountable, vulnerable and disposable.   Faye devours Kong in this one.  Take a look.

0800177975|5.0|The following story will tell you why this movie bombed at the box office.<br /><br />While visiting family in Miami one of my cousins went to see the movie. When he got home he was telling me how much the movie stunk. As he was talking it became obvious to me that he had taken the movie seriously. So I yelled at him \\"It's a parody!! He's making fun of action movies in general and himself in particular!!\\" I could see the lightbulb go on over his head and he went right out and saw it again.<br /><br />Needless to say, he loved the film. As do I. It's not often that a big star has the guts to make fun of himself just to make his fans laugh. So if you have this film languishing in your collection somewhere you need to see it with this in mind. It's parody. Satire. Comedy! Watch it and have fun.

B000F0V0LI|5.0|I decided to purchase this dvd to show in my Film Analysis class.  For years I thought that \\"The Searchers\\" was becoming more and more dated, but now I think it has found relevance in new ways.  The theme of racial hatred and intolerance, of violent opposition to that which is different, speaks today to a world in which religion hates religion and seeks to destroy its ideological enemies.  It is a world of absolutes where tolerance has little chance to survive.  Revenge and victory have become the most important goals in international conflicts.  \\"The Searchers\\" espouses some hope at the end, but today, frankly. . . . <br /> <br />Man's inhumanity to man is a pretty universal theme, and \\"The Searchers\\" is a pretty universal movie. <br /> <br />The technical attributes of this film have been stated many times, and I won't rehash that.  The dvd itself is well put together--much good supporting material.
B000AP04NI|5.0|Very good shipping time. received package within 3 days. The dvd was brand new as stated, that doesn't happen that often. Thank you and I WILL be using Amazon.com from now on. KE from OHIO
B000FSME1A|2.0|I bought this at a store on an impulse buy. I wish that I'd checked Amazon first as it is less expensive here and now I learn that you must change out discs in the middle of the film. (Who was the imbecile that came up with that idea?) When I saw that it was 2 discs, I naturally assumed that each version was relegated to it's own disc. It's a great film but this DVD set could have been put together much better.
B00004S367|5.0|I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WITH THIS ALBUM, STEVIE WONDER CAME INTO HIS OWN, BECAUSE HE HAD RECORDED A LOT OF FANTASTIC MUSIC BEFORE THIS, BUT THIS ONE TAKES HIS MUSIC TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL.  I HAVE HAD THIS ALBUM, CASSETTE, CD, SINCE IT CAME BACK LONGER THAN I CARE TO REMEMBER.  THIS ALBUM WAS THE STEPPING STONE TO TALKING BOOK AND INNER VISIONS, WHICH WERE ALSO ALL TIME CLASSIC RECODRINGS.  IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE THIS CD, I WOULD SAY IT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT REALLY FEATURED THE MATURE VOICE OF STEVIE WONDER. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE HEARD THIS ALBUM, IT HAS ALWAYS BROUGHT A SMILE TO MY FACE, WHICH I GUESS IS THE TRUEST INDICATION OF WHETHER SOMETHING IS GREAT OR NOT.

B000FA57N0|2.0|I bought this HD-DVD because of all the good reviews, but I am very dissapointed in the Film... I guess you have to be a fan of the short-lived series??<br /><br />The Acting/Plot was Sub-Par, like most B-Class Movies. The transfer to HD-DVD was not impressive. I am a Sci-Fi Fan (Star Wars, Star Trek, Etc.) but this one was not enjoyable. It had a few laughs, but there was always an \\"evil\\" undertone to the entire film, I watched the behind the scenes and the interviews, and for some reason all the people used a lot of profanity, not sure why?<br /><br />I think if the storyline was tweaked a bit, and better actors were used (the main character showed no expression in his face, he would say one line in anger and the other in happiness, all with the same expression), with a slightly larger budget, the movie would have been good.<br /><br />I'm going to be selling this one!<br /><br />Don't Waste your Money.

B000LC55F2|5.0|Just saw this movie tonight.  Usually rent before I buy, but bought this tonight after waiting almost 1 hour in line (network was down).  Was is worth it?  Yes, every penny.  This movie will leave you dumbfounded at the end.  Simply drooling with your mouth open dumbfounded.  I haven't seen 'The Illusionist' but I am 100% certain I will not like it better than 'The Prestige.'  Definitely one of the top 5 thrillers I've ever seen.  If you can find it for a decent price buy it - you won't be disappointed.  Well done, Mr. Nolan.

0486227073|4.0|I've been a fan of George Bridgman's books ever since I bought Constructive Anatomy, and followed it with the 100 hands book. I found the Human Machine and ordered it because I wanted to see more references in regards to how the body movies. I'm not severely disappointed but I suppose I was expecting a bit more. I was hoping for more full body references which would separate the book from Constructive Anatomy. Unfortunately it didn't deliver.<br /><br />I did find the information in this book highly useful, but I have to agree that the print quality of the illustrations can be frustrating for some people. I am not bothered by it because I want something that is loose and interpretive, but explanatory. The problem with many art books is that they get so detailed in anatomy an artist trying to learn life drawing isn't learning to interpret the information but simply copies it.<br /><br />You need illustrations like this to help your juices flow and act more creatively. If everything is drawn out for you in explicit detail how do you learn to fill in the gaps and experiment? That is why I found Bridgman's books more valuable to me than the super detailed anatomy books. His methods of construction have helped me out greatly in learning to flesh out my figures from stick forms.<br /><br />The other value of this book is it's price. Why waste 30 dollars or more when these books are usually 10 dollars or less? My other book is becoming worn from extreme use, but at least I know I can easily replace the book at a low cost!
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|First, I just have to give SIA credit for being so unique. In a genre where vocals are wispy and drawn out and dramatic, she manages all these feats while still doing it her way. At times soulfoul and at times etheral, you definitely wont feel like you're listening to a female vocalist you've heard before. I hate to say it, but I enjoy SIA's solo album more than her work with ZERO 7. Its a great album to listen to while driving, studying, cooking, for a get-together, or just to \\"chill\\" out. But not as ambient as the others in her genre, so it wont put you to sleep. I dont skip though any of the songs which is always, to me, the sign of a well produced album. We all know and love the song \\"breathe me\\". Moving, powerful lyrics. Featured on \\"six feet under\\" and as the preview song for \\"freedom writers\\". But the best song on the album,hands down, is MOON. I love love love this song. I feel like I'm floating when I listen and it literally transcends. The only pity is that I didn't find out about this album sooner. Get it. Truely worth the two lattes, half tank of gas, or 3 packs of American Spirits. Either way you analyze the cost its so WORTH IT!

B000EWBKKI|4.0|This classic SF adventure has never looked better than it does on Blu-Ray.  I watched it with the DTS soundtrack and the audio is excellent.  Colors are bold, rich and vibrant and the picture is razor-sharp.<br /><br />I've seen this in the theater, on tape, laserdisc, and the Ultimate Edition DVD.  I certainly don't regret purchasing it on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Some fans will be disappointed as this doesn't include the extended cut, only the theatrical version.  Also, there is almost nothing in the way of bonus material.<br /><br />If all you want is the movie, this is the one to get.  If the bonus features are important, the Extreme Edition DVD (which I haven't seen) may be a better choice.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I'm a new fan of John Mayer.    After watching his recent New York concert on Freeview I looked for a CD that had alot of the songs he sang at the concert.  This one was the one I chose and I can't stop listening to it. <br />He is amazing.    Anyone who is a John Mayer fan, you have to get this CD!
B00030590I|4.0|This is not normally the type of film I enjoy, but after getting a new big screen plasma TV, with surround sound, we were told it would be a good first pick. It was.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I bought this movie because I love Tom Hanks' pictures (not all of them, but 99.98%). This is another classic young Hanks; a picture which can be watched over and over for comedic relief!! Thank you Mr. Hanks!!!
B00001OH7O|5.0|I haven't heard much Bowie at all, but it must be said that I like all I've heard so far. And this is my favorite of the three albums of his I've heard (the others are Station to Station and Ziggy Stardust). This is the most Beatlesque of the Bowie releases I've heard - with orchestration, piano-based rockers and an expert sense of melody. But before one accuses Bowie of copying the Beatles' formula, he brings a few things of his own to the table: intentionally campy vocals, heavy guitars, bizarre sci-fi lyrics, and a general sense of druggy madness. As a result, songs like Changes, Oh! You Pretty Things, Life on Mars? and Quicksand feel comfortable as an old shoe, but at the same point unlike anything you'll ever here. And when he rocks out (Song to Bob Dylan, the mysoginistic but irresistable Queen Bitch), it's irresistable. The whole album works like a charm. About a dozen excellent records came out in 1971, and this is easily one of them. Enjoy!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Another Enya for my collection. Relaxing and soothing describes her music. She is a classic onto herself. However \\"they\\" clasify her, she is a keeper!!!
B000002IHD|5.0|Tired of what passes for soul these days? Had enough of Destiny's Child, John Legend, etc.? Then let me tell you about Otis Redding. This is the man who penned Respect - yeah, so Aretha's version is definitive, but his ain't too shabby either. This also contains Otis' first big hit, the oft-covered I've Been Loving You Too Long, which has survived being butchered by the Rolling Stones - out of its many covers, it's best heard here. And speaking of the Stones, Otis' version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction is a surprisingly good reading of the just rock classic, especially considering it's a fine example of record company prostitution - the Rolling Stones had hit big with it a few months prior to this album's release. Otis' is funky, soulful, etc. And how about the bluesy Ole Man Trouble? Man, that song's a killer. \\"Don't want you, Ole Man Trouble, don't need you, Ole Man Trouble...\\" damn! Is that soul, or what?  Two cool Sam Cooke covers (Shake and Wonderful World) round this classic album out. I enjoy every song (with the possible exception of a rather limp My Girl), and this is one of my favorite Soul LP's.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I bought this movies because I love Tom Hanks! And Daryl Hanna was a great match-up. I can watch this movie over and over. It's just a fun movie to watch when you need a comedic lift!!! AND not to forget ever John Candy & Eugene Levy!!!
B00006AW2S|3.0|First, the good news: this contains two of the Stones' best a-sides to date (or ever, for that matter): The Last Time, a rockin' lvoe song with a cool guitar riff, and especially (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, easily one of the biggest songs of the whole decade. Just as good, if not better, is The Last Time's b-side Play with Fire, little more Mick's growl and harpsichord. Still, it's one of the most menacing songs ever. Anyway, a few of the other songs on this disc are good too - I like the country-sounding Spider and the Fly, The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man (b-side to Satisfaction), and the high-energy cover of Mercy Mercy. They rip through the song in typical early Stones fashion. I could do with pretty much every other song on the album, though (One More Try; Hitch Hike; Good Times; That's How Strong My Love Is), so it's hard to call this an essential unless you're a Stones freak. And if you see the UK version, try to avoid it - it drops the singles, replacing them with Heart of Stone. While Heart was a highlight of Now!, the singles pretty much make this album, so without them it's incomplete.
B00000269G|4.0|Sometimes the \\"old sound\\" becomes part of the charm of an old recording. But this performance is just poorly handled, a shame since it was a wonderful concert. Get it for the music, but don't expect it to sound good.
B0000033IS|5.0|Yeah, I've always been a fan of Aretha's. But I gained a new appreciation for her upon hearing this soul landmark. It's seriously up there with those Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder classics. She is, simply, the ultimate soul singer, with the ultimate soul anthem to her credit: Respect. She took the Otis Redding song and gave it quite the makeover. Sure, Otis' version is great, but this one puts it and any other covers of it to shame and back. The rest of the album lives in Respect's shadow, but there's lots more to like about it: the bluesy title track, for one, as well as moving versions of Do-Right Woman, Do-Right Man and Sam Cooke's oft-covered A Change is Gonna Come. Speaking of covers, I love her versions of Drown in My Own Tears and Good Times. Sure, both are overrecorded, but Aretha somehow gives them personality. And Dr. Feelgood has to be her most underrated. Even a few of the minor tracks (Soul Serenade; Baby, Baby, Baby, Save Me) would've led the way on a lesser album.<br /><br />Be sure to buy this. I know that most consider soul a more singles-based genre than an album-based one, but there are quite a few good soul LP's out there that deserve the same recognition as the '60's rock classics. This is one of them.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|A Matter of Life and Death is easily thier best since Seventh Son of Seventh Son. Bruce is still the best metal vocalist, period. All 10 tracks on this CD are great.
B000002LMK|4.0|To me, this is Neil's best post-'70's album. It rocks, a glorious mess of feedback, dissonance, and pure friggin' noise. A bit I could've done without (White Line; Over and Over; Farmer John; Days That Used to Be), but so much of this blows my mind that's beside the point. As usual, there are the extended guitar pieces that are PERFECT for Neil's undescribable technique - Country Home, Love to Burn and Love & Only Love, the big bad guitar showpieces, easily blow away Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and others in terms of both sheer volume and sheer virtuosity. I love how Neil's making use of the 80 minutes on CD to show off his guitar skills, rather than padding the record out. A couple of the shorter songs also prove the Grandfather of Grunge was still alive and kickin' back in '91 (and still is today!): Mansion on the Hill and F*!#in' Up, which along with Barstool BLues is one of his funniest songs ever. Then there's Mother Earth (Natural Anthem), closes the album on a rockin', feedback-happy note while copping the melody of the old standard The Water Is Wide. What can I say? This really is something, that's what. Be sure to have this.
B000001DZM|5.0|In every way, thas to be the most flaming gay CD ever made, and it's brilliant! Even the CD case is pink!<br /><br />I have to say, the soundtrack to this movie is nearly as funny as the movie itself. But where the movie gains it humor from situational comedy and humanity, the soundtrack is ironic and cheesy to the far extreme.<br /><br />Nevertheless, put this on at a party and watch all the grown-ups get up to dance.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|i know that some people didn't like the 3rd movie but i did and that's why i preordered it on amazon. i was so happy to get it, haven't watched it yet, but it includes the traps of saw 3 and that is probably the coolest part of the dvd. so definitely recommended for any SAW fan.
B000002GJ7|5.0|To me Extreme was one of the most overlooked bands of the 90's.  \\"Pornograffitti\\" was the band's big breakout album containing the huge hit ballad \\"More Than Words\\".  Unfortunately the song and the video got the band lumped in to the \\"hair metal\\" category and many dismissed them as just another Warrant, Ratt or Winger clone.  The truth is that Extreme was heads and tails above most of their peers and was really a creative band that was not afraid to try many different things.  More importantly they had the talent to pull it off.  As musicians Nuno Bettencourt was an outstanding guitarist and vocalist Gary Charone was as good as any other 90's frontman in the business.  The music on \\"Pornograffitti\\" is all over the place with metal, ballads, funk, folk, and even a 1940's-ish crooner ballad in \\"When I First Kissed You\\".  The band's mix of metal and funk on songs like \\"Get The Funk Out\\", \\"Little Jack Horney\\" and others remind me of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in spots.  The other big hit from this album \\"Hole Hearted\\" has a folk vibe with chiming acoustic guitars and gorgeous vocals.  There really is not a bad song on the disc.  The lyrics are continuously clever and at times quite funny.  If you are only familiar with \\"More Than Words\\" don't let that put you off.  This album is much more than that song.  One thing that I always found amusing about \\"More Than Words\\" is that I remember a lot of people (especially women) who lauded this track for being such a great love song.  I even have seen it used as the bride and groom dance in weddings.  What has always cracked me up is that if you really listen to the lyrics this is anything but a love song.  It is basically a guy using the old \\"if you loved me you'd show me\\" excuse to get a woman into bed.  Just goes to show how much many people pay attention to lyrics of songs they supposedly love.  Anyway....the bottom line is that, although I don't think this is Extreme's best, this is an excellent album from a band that never got the credit they deserved in my opinion.
B000AMWIVM|3.0|i thought that it was going to be more bloody than the SAW movie was. It was or at least I didn't think it was. The only cool thing was the case that the movie came in. the front is like a bag of some sort with blood in it and a jigsaw that floats around. really cool. not sure if it's worth the exact money for this version of the dvd.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I can still smell the salt and anticipation in the air as my friend and I waited in line to see Jaws on opening night! We were first in a very long line,the film would not disappoint anyone there that night! We were so impressed we went back the next night, with a few more friends in tow. We just wanted to see our unsuspecting friends and the audience lose there precious popcorn every time Bruce the shark would briefly appear. The famous head scene is the biggest jolt and it scared the you know what out of everyone in the theater! Living in Wildwood N.J. one block from the ocean, made the film all the more real and it kept most of us from enjoying the ocean for quite some time. To this day, over 30 years later! I do not feel completely at ease when I'm in the ocean and my feet leave the ocean floor! That is some impact for a film to have over a man who has watched so many really scary movies.<br /><br />I own both the 25th and the 30th anniversary editions and I watch one of them almost on a yearly basis. I have a 10 foot screen in my home theater and it is almost like opening night every time I watch it! One of the best films ever made and probably the scariest. The 30th anniversay edition is the better edition with original mono soundtrack and complete documentary, but beware!... the 30th ann. edition does not include the theatrical trailer! This is inexcusable! Even so, the extra length of the documentary and the original and DTS soundtrack make this a worthy upgrade. If you don't own the 25th ann. then the 30th ann. You might want to keep your 25th ann. for the trailer :-( .....da....dum.......da dum.....

0743289684|5.0|[...] This is a riveting, deeply moving auobiography of a woman, reared in an oppressive Muslim society, who fled to the West and gradually came to embrace western values. When she coproduced a film depicting the abuse and oppression of Muslim women, she received death threats, and her coproducer was murdered. She has given us a wakeup call. We will all need to have her courage to overcome this totalitarian ideology that threatens the values we hold dear.
0439813786|5.0|First let me say this:  Try to read as little as possible about this book, especially the reviews here, because it's a really good book that's definitely worth reading but some of the reviews have spoilers. <br /> <br />OK, now on to some comments.  The book is a really fast read: even though it's over 500 pages, perhaps a third or more are full-page pictures, and most of the text pages are only a paragraph or so.  I read the entire thing in three hours and I'm not a particularly fast reader. <br /> <br />There's a lot to like in this book but I'll leave you to discover that on your own (or, at your peril with spoilers, to find in other reviews here), but there was one thing that bothered me: Some of the characters have secrets that seem to be secrets merely as a plot device.  For example, Hugo refuses to explain some things and we're never given enough motivation-- he just doesn't want to tell, even though it would be to his advantage.  Things like that feel contrived and, to me, take away from the overall enjoyment.  It would be like if in a movie someone in Los Angeles wanted to get a bottle of milk, but instead of just going to a local store, got on a flight to New York to get the milk there and the plane got hijacked, leading to a big adventure. <br /> <br />But despite that caveat, I still highly recommend this book for people of all ages.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie has been my #1 Comedy for many years... still is... and most likely will continue to be for many years to come.  It speaks to anyone \\"raised\\" in a cubicle - you will find in almost all the characters \\"someone\\" you knew at some point in your life, when you worked at \\"so and so\\".  So many real-life scenarios I felt as if someone had been watching me with a camera back in those days!  And every time I've watched it (and yes... that number is in the \\"double\\" digits) I always find something that I overlooked or have forgotten about and rediscover it with delight and laugh out loud all over again, as if for the first time!  A true gem!  Feeling blue?  Just pop this movie... you'll forget your worries - if only for a couple of hours...
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I love this album. She is amazing. All of her songs are wonderful, very whimisical, happy, sad, heartfelt. Love the musical accompaniment. Beautiful chord progressions.
1567184855|5.0|I always felt that there is a higher power but not \\"God\\" as we know it.  All these case histories of souls and energy, after life experiences and such just reinforced what I seem to know.  This helped me answer the nagging question of \\"why am I here?\\"  I got so absorbed that I read it in two nights.  I'm certainly not afraid to die after reading this book.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I have only listened to it once.  It is okay, but not as good as her first album.  Maybe it will grow on me.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Just because a movie features characters dealing with alcoholism or drug use or both, does that mean that it's automatically \\"one of the best movies of the year\\"? Don't get me wrong, I liked Requiem (well, parts of it) but there's enough to recommend a viewing but I always wonder whether people say these movies are masterpieces simply because it tackles a hard subject matter. I mean, have you ever heard of someone outright bashing a war movie? And so we have Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to the rightly praised Pi; a no-holds barred and unflinching look at drug use and the deterioration of them. <br /> <br />The film follows 4 characters: Harry, his girlfriend Marion, Harry's friend Tyrone and Harry's mother Sara. The former 3 are drug users who pawn TV's to get money while Sara; hearing of the news she'll be on TV, takes diet pills to fit into her old dress. Pretty soon all 4 of them find themselves given a good mind **** about what it is to be addicted to something and the realization you ran out. <br /> <br />The film uses many different filmmaking techniques to lend different images to its story. We have the snorricam (a camera attached to the actor, commonly seen in those night-vision haunted house TV shows), a camera shaking violently complete with warped sound, split screen, quick editing, dissolves and shots with fast-motion mixed with slow motion. This makes the film certainly visually packed with stuff but there's barely any substance. In other words, we don't care about these characters when we should; aside from Ellen Burstyn's character, everyone is just simply plot puppets as I call them. They're not fleshed out characters but the amount of visuals being used and the subject suggests we should care but we don't; we just see these drug addicts turn into something with no care about how they'll end up, we just watch them do it. <br /> <br />Not to say there's nothing to recommend here because there is. Burstyn, as Aronofsky says in hiscommentary, is so all over the place within the same scene that it's sad she lost to that wench from Erin Brockovich. Hell, Juliette Binoche in Chocolat was better than her. And it's surprising to see Marlon Wayans doing a dramatic role and being good although he does at times do stuff that seems \\"Marlon-esque\\". Jennifer Connelly is of course good while Christopher McDonald plays a great send-off of those bad motivational speakers you see on TV. <br /> <br />While I am recommending the film, I hate the kind of self-knowing importance the film has. It's one thing to have an unrated \\"director's cut\\" the same thing since the film ignored the MPAA and just released the film unrated anyway but to have the Play button listed with \\"watch the inspirational film!\\" seems kind of egotistical to me. But at least it's a good movie at times so I won't be that harsh on that part.
B00005JPCD|5.0|I am 29 and I loved this movie!!!  I don't understand why people beat it up so badly about the environment.  It's important for everyone to have a balanced view, and the environmentalists rarely get heard by the mainstream.  The movie was so much fun.  I loved the singing, the dancing, and the really witty lines.  The Spanish penguins were hilarious! I enjoyed it so much that I will buy the DVD as soon as it comes out.
0060557818|3.0|I was first introduced to Neil Gaiman with the book American Gods - I blasted through it and then promptly set out on a quest to track down every other one of his books.  Unfortunately, none of his other books have yet lived up to the (albeit very high) standard set by American Gods.  Gaiman is an exemplary storyteller, and his stories are always full of fantastical characters and settings.  With such a rich, embroidered world, it is easy to fall completely into it; however, once you are in it, the story does not really go anywhere.  Little about the plot is especially creative, and the conclusion is a disappointingly unoriginal illustration of the worn out theme of \\"power corrupts.\\"  It's okay, and good for younger readers who have not yet been over-exposed to the structure of traditional fantasy, but don't bother if you are looking for a masterpiece like his graphic novels or American Gods.
B000286RKW|5.0|No-one but Martin Scorcese could have created 'Goodfellas'. When it comes to the mood, tempo, soundrack and social setting of a film, no-one can hit everything as pitch perfect as him. <br /> <br />In 'Goodfellas' we are thrown into the familiar world of the Italian mobster. Although it is a scene that has been visited many times in the movie world, 'Goodfellas' still manages to raise the bar throughout this genre, and, to this day, still outclasses its long line of imitators. <br /> <br />The casting is one of the best and most enjoyable parts of this movie. The interplay between Liotta, De Niro and Pesci is a wonder to behold and their chemistry does jutice to an excellent script. On top of this is an impressive narrative told through the lead character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Often narratives can be very heavy handed and lack subtlety, however this one fits the bill perfectly. <br /> <br />'Goodfellas' is essentially as close to perfect as a mob movie can get. It is quite possibly the best movie that Scorcese or De Niro ever made, and that is really saying something. Enjoy.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is one of the best versions to come out in recent years. The actors were well chosen. Jane Eyre has always been one of my favorite storys and this is one of the best.
B000000H5J|5.0|That's right, I may be one of the few, if not the only one to not regard this album as FF's best. Why? Because, although all songs rule on this one, and all of them are equally great, they are also very alike, almost like the same song repeated many times over. Oh, don't get me wrong, \\"Demanufacture\\" had only one prevailing rival for the CD of 1995: Death's \\"Symbolic\\". Fear Factory's barely second offering remains a surprisingly mature and original effort, though it is not too hard to point out their influences: Sepultura (BIG TIME),Machine Head, Pantera, Type O'Negative, Megadeth and Life of Agony. But for all these inspirations, \\"Demanufacture\\" was and continues to be one of the most profoundly influential albums for metal music, especially the development of modern metalcore. I would say, without this CD, metalcore would not exist. Still, it is not Fear Factory's best work, although, admittedly it's really close. For me the best FF's offering is \\"Obsolete\\" (but I have yet to hear \\"Archetype\\", though). Every track on that record not only destroys, but is also entirely different from the other. But onto \\"Demanufacture\\". The very first thing that stands out is the artificial (in a good way) marriage of guitars and drums. They seem to be one and the same, especially on \\"Replica\\". Thus NO ONE has ever played metal. Sure, there have been quasi-metal industrial bands such as Front Line Assembly (which actually offers so little metal it would not be enough for even one full length). But no one dared to take seemingly mutually exclusive elements of programming and drum machines and fuse it brilliantly with aggressive deathcore. I dare say, that this album inspired even the awesome Dark Tranquility to experiment with technology on their less straight-forward death metal releases. But that is not all, because FF also manages to infuse their music with melody reminiscent of Type O'Negative or Life OF Agony wrapped around truly devastating riffing with the crushing power not so dissimilar to Machine Head's \\"Burn My Eyes\\". The last song on \\"Demanufacture\\", phenomenal \\"A Therapy for Pain\\" even sounds like TON from \\"Bloody Kisses\\" but we are too far from actual plagiarism, in fact FF NEVER plagiarized anyone to my knowledge. All contraire, many have more or less successfully copied them (that's you, Soilwork). My all time favorite song from this masterpiece is \\"Self Bias Resistor\\", an ideal revolutionary lyrical and musical statement. Any Liberal would indeed love the lyrics, and any Conservative'll hate it. But the song also calls for using your own mind and demand individual freedom from pervasive intrusion of politics and religion. Indeed, in one of the most brilliant anti-religion anthems, even if unimaginatively named \\"Pisschrist\\" ostensibly rages against Christianity and Jesus Christ. But the song is really about the type of Christ fed to us by our corrupted self-serving pastors, the kind of IMMINENT SAVIOR FROM THIS ERA that is simply unbiblical. The Man said after all: \\"My Kingdom is NOT of this world.\\" (go argue THAT in the Supreme Court!) In truth, Fear Factory may not be particularly religious, but many of their lyrics are infused with ambiguous approach to religion and spirituality. No, Fear Factory are simply SICK OF BEING LIED TO from the political or clerical sandboxes, and may in fact be against ORGANIZED religion, and since man's history provides a vast evidence that organized religion is mostly subliminal and progressive indoctrination and  sometimes even oppressive brainwashing (Middle Ages) of the elites over gullible sheep, I can't blame Burton and Co. for their views. Wanna know where I draw the line: \\"Christ Illusion\\" and Slayer, but that's a whole another argument. As for \\"Demanufacture\\", the music and lyrics act as the gadfly to a society headed for Theocratic Fascism in America. This sadly has not changed in the past 12 years, but rather had gotten worse. Human beings are still worth NOTHING to their governments,and human tragedy is only defined and measured by millions not thousands of lost lives (Iraq). The most remarkable and horrifying thing about Fear Factory's message clothed in ostensible coat of Man vs. Machine concept, is that it is still relevant today, if not more. America is undergoing a Demanufacturing of reason and value of human life. So go ahead, crank up \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" and \\"burn away conformity\\"...before they take your right to do so!and human tragedy is only defined and measured by millions not thousands of lost lives (Iraq).

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I saw the movie yesterday and loved it. After the movie, I immmediately bought the sound track. Like the movie it is pure fun. Hugh Grant's voice & music are perfect for the catchy 8o's songs! The takeoffs on modern music are  right on target and also fun. <br />     The highlights of the soundtrack - are the highlights of the movie- Grant's :Pop! Goes My Heart and the memorable duet of Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore: Way Back Into Love. The latter song has some dialogue between Drew & Hugh which captures the romantic & humorous spirit of the movie. <br />    I hope radio plays these songs they deserve to be hits!

Good Jazz. <br /> <br />Helluva voice.  <br /> <br />Nice take on some well-worn standards. <br /> <br />This and the Vince Guarldi Charlie Brown Christmas album are the only two Christmas albums that should be given to everybody who ever bought a CD player, Ipod, whatever. <br /> <br />Nice dress.  <br /> <br />Elvis Costello (Mr. Diana Krall) better thank God every day. <br /> <br />I proudly listen to this album at non-Christmas times of the year, by the way. When it plays at work, someone almost always stops and says \\"Who is THAT?\\"; never \\"Why are you listening to Christmas music in June?\\". That's the power of the voice and arrangements we're dealing with, here.  <br /> <br />Thank you for coming into my life, if only as a beautiful voice. And what a voice!

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins' book covers almost every conceivable argument in favour of the belief in some supernatural influence over our lives and dissects them to show how fragile and hollow they are. His analyses are thorough, thought-provoking, and well referenced to the material he is using in support of his points.

0312330871|5.0|This is the first Agatha Christie mystery that I have read and I chose to start with what is perhaps her best known novel.  Seeing the book corrupted in newer editions to remove all references to Indians seems like covering the privates parts of Michelangelo's David.  Changing the title was offensive, but changing the content is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Compared to many modern tales of mystery, this story is somewhat simple.  There does not seem to be any twists in the plot just for the sake of including a twist.  The suspense builds as to the identity of the murderer as fewer of the ten are among the living.  At some point, the reader may begin to suspect that the murderer is not among the final three.  The nursery rhyme on which the story is based openly tells of a red herring.<br /><br />More than a mystery, this book makes suggestions about social justice.  Not every crime falls in the explicit classifications of the law.  However, this does not make the injustice any less of a crime.  While becoming a vigilante seems to be a hypocritical response to any injustices, the idea certainly raises ethical and moral questions worthy of discussion.

B0000004V2|5.0|Don't get me wrong I'm an Ex-pat that lives in the States, I love the country, but the recording industry here has me scratching my head sometimes.  There is a definitive belief in my mind that the industry here is very closed minded, or perhaps just biased.  It's only really Radiohead and Coldplay that has made it in recent times.  The dullest, most boring bands I have ever heard.  Sure they each had a couple of good tunes, but come on!!  Oasis had some success, but they were not even a quarter of the band The Stone Roses were.  For those of you out there who say I'm just another Brit who reads the NME or just thinks Brit bands are better, I say to you its not the case I'm making. I think the UK is open to all American Music, but it just doesn't work the other way around and it could.  I've played close friends here Shed Seven, Dodgy, and Kula Shaker, the Roses, and even The Happy Mondays.  Many have stated that he could not believe these bands had never made it in the States, and that they made excellent records.  Whatever your point of view. I can confidently state that this album is one of the best of all time.
B000NA28IE|1.0|\\"Eragon\\" wants to be \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It really, really wants to be. In a pinch, it'll settle for \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" with a dash of Harry Potter.<br /><br />But those hoping for a spectacular PG-rated epic shouldn't hold their breaths, because the adaptation of Christopher Paolini's bestseller is a massive bellyflop. The direction is stilted and plodding, the acting is on par with tree stumps, and the whole thing is uninspired -- it never moves beyond \\"quick cash-in.\\"<br /><br />A young woman is being chased through the woods by a band of evil soldiers, trying to recapture a bright blue stone she stole from evil King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), but she magics it away. It's found in the woods by a young farm boy, Eragon (Edward Speleers), who unsuccessfully tries to trade it for food. But the stone turns out to be a dragon's egg.<br /><br />When his home and uncle are destroyed, Eragon escapes with his now-grown dragon Saphira (Rachael Weisz) and a mysterious stranger named Brom (Jeremy Irons), who knows a lot about the Dragon Riders. Now Eragon and Saphira may be the only hope for the land, not to mention the captive elf princess he's dreaming about, and whom he has to rescue from the evil king.<br /><br />Dragons, damsels in distress, magic spells, an evil king and his evil wizard, and a Young Hero in the Luke Skywalker mold... well, \\"Eragon\\" had a lot of obstacles in front of it from the start. It sounds like the love child of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\"... except it's infinitely more clumsy than either of those movies.<br /><br />And the director doesn't help -- Stefan Fangmeier is horribly crude and clumsy in his directing, with a style that manages to be both stilted and choppy. The scripting is even worse. Expect the most pompous, cliched fantasyspeak imaginable (\\"It is your fate to be a Dragon Rider. The Varden need a Rider if they are to defeat Durza and the king.\\" \\"I didn't ask for any of this!\\" \\"But you were chosen, nevertheless!\\").<br /><br />It's not surprising, since Fangmeier has never even directed a short film before. His only prior movie work has been for visual effects, which might explain why the CGI for Saphira the dragon is so beautifully detailed and fluid. Wonderful work there. But not enough to make you forget the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Speleers looks like a deer in the headlights, while Sienna Guillory has all the elegance and magic of hobbit feet, and Malkovich is given the most 2-D villain role of the 21st century. The supporting actors give the only solid performances, miscast as they are -- Weisz gives a wonderfully nuanced performance, while Irons is solid as the mentor figure.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" has the occasional good performance or moment of excellence -- usually from Weisz as Saphira.

B00005YU1O|4.0|I loved the content of this movie and thought that it really encourages one to think about their environment and the possibilities that surround them.  However, the animation almost never holds still.  For the characters, this would be fine, but while the characters are talking, you'll often find that the background waves and shifts as if you're on a boat.  I think it's supposed to lead to the \\"dream\\" feeling, but I mostly found it distracting and almost had to turn it off a couple times.
B000002I4W|5.0|This album signified a defining moment in jazz music upon its release in 1959, the sound unpredictable and free to come and go as it pleases. What came to be commonly referred to as free jazz or avant-garde was viewed by some as an affront to the integrity of jazz music at large. For some critics, it was easier to dismiss Coleman as an unskilled technician rather than face the possibility that he just may be brilliant. Coleman became so influential in the scene and movement of his day that even John Coltrane was exploring freer compositions as a result.<br /><br />The sound quality on this disc is superb. Coleman uses silence in a haunting way, shaping his music around its backdrop and occasionally using it as a centerpiece. This album is fresh and new every time you listen to it, the emotional effect being a soothing and calming one. Sure to become an instant favorite in anyone's collection, Ornette Coleman's \\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\\" will seldom find itself outside of your turntables.<br /><br />Personnel: Ornette Coleman (alto saxophone), Don Cherry (cornet), Charlie Haden (bass) and Billy Higgins (drums).
B000JLTRKE|5.0|Wow.  It's almost hard to put into words to describe this movie.  I can say that have kleenex handy because you'll need it.  Never in my entire life have I cried for so long and so hard during a movie.  No movie has ever affected me this way.<br /><br />Many of us remember that morning so vividly. September 11th, 2001.  I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see the film.  I remember watching the TV, glued to it, for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question, instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.<br /><br />I am so glad I decided to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. It's a film of last words and feelings we tend to develop after years in a relationship. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this film with strong acting from a huge cast.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film although it may certainly be tough for those who lost loved ones in the buildings.

B000LC55F2|5.0|Abracadabra! I missed this in the theaters, but I preordered the DVD based on my respect for the wonderful Nolan brothers (MEMENTO). I knew little about THE PRESTIGE except that it was set in Victorian London and based on a highly regarded novel about rival magicians, and that's the ideal way to see it--the whole thing comes as one big surprise after another. The directing, script, acting, design, etc., are all excellent, and the payoff is astonishing. And beyond the rivalry of the two stage magicians, we have the famous war between two actual wizards, Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. There is some very real magic going on here. As one character asks us several times, \\"Are you watching closely?\\" Do as he says--but you'll want to watch it again, anyway. Do not miss this literate, intelligent thriller.

B00005Q45W|4.0|Hearing the throaty \\"Everybody Knows\\" in the movie \\"Pump up the Volume\\" (1990) had me envisioning an aged black man with deep wrinkles in his face, but the baritone voice belonged to Leonard Cohen: white, descended from Polish ancestry, and born into a Jewish middle-class family in Montreal, Canada.    \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" (1968), Cohen's first, was produced after becoming an accomplished poet and novelist. Generally the singer has received greater attention in Canada and Europe than the good ol' U.S.A. Listen to any older album prior to 1984 with the exception of \\"Death of a Ladies' Man\\" (1977) and one hears soul-bearing songs - dirges in the vein of open wrists and blood dribbling married to the sound of pure, simple instruments. However, the prosaically named album, \\"Ten New Songs\\" (2001), has a tinge of the hopeful but also continues the synthetic mood music begun by Cohen's 1984 album, \\"Various Positions.\\" The slight upbeat in lyrics can be attributed to a lifelong depression recently leaving (in an interview Cohen says he read the brain loses its anxieties as it grows older and cites this as a possible reason for his depression lifting).    Sharon Robinson (co-author of \\"Everybody Knows\\") appeared as a back-up singer on past albums and is by Cohen's side again as a back-up singer, co-writer, producer and arranger (probably left something out). Robinson actually shares the album's cover photo with Cohen. One may begin to wonder why her name is not besides Cohen's on the album's title since her input is apparently quite significant (Cohen's vision forms the album). She croons the title refrain, \\"In My Secret Life,\\" several times on the opening track just before handing over the meat of the lyrics: \\"I saw you this morning./ You were moving so fast./ Can't seem to loosen my grip/ On the past./ And I miss you so much./ There's no one in sight./ And we're still making love/ In My Secret Life.\\" Cohen's signature melancholy is still evident. \\"I'm turning tricks,I'm getting fixed,/ I'm back on Boogie Street\\" (\\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\"). \\"You Have Loved Enough\\" proves true love is present and thriving among the darkness. \\"That I am not the one who loves - It's love that seizes me./ When hatred with his package comes,/ You forbid delivery./ And when the hunger for your touch/ Rises from the hunger,/ You whisper, 'You have loved enough,/ Now let me be the Lover.'\\"    The glaring deficit of \\"Ten New Songs\\" is the music or more appropriately called muzak. Often, only humdrum sounds accompany the adept lyrics. Randomly pick a track and chances are the same artificial drumbeat along with an electronic keyboard mix that sounds awfully close to what one can produce with a couple hits of a home keyboard and its repeat button will be heard. Serious flaws that would have crippled most albums, but Cohen's impeccable delivery and polished poetic lyrics make the trip down \\"Boogie Street\\" irresistible.    Bohdan Kot
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I found this program to be extremely informative and very relavent to environmental issues facing us.

B000GCFO0I|3.0|Silent Hill achieved the 'Best Video game to movie' tag in my opinion...Which considering what it was up against with all due respect, wasn't that difficult! <br />However, it is a good movie. It's just one of those movies which sadly could have been better. The hype, the anticipation, from Silent Hill fans like myself waiting for this movie was unbelievable. And once I got to see it, I did have mixed feelings. <br />It starts wonderfully, and the imagery throughout is fantastic. Somewhere through the middle though it loses it a little and forgets it's a 'Silent Hill' movie/story, and tries too hard to tie loose ends.  <br />It's not bad-I wanted this movie to be fantastic and mess with my mind like the original PS1 game did...but expected it to be awful. In the end it landed somewhere in the middle with a movie I like but felt wasn't quite there. If you like the game, and you like the horror movie genre, go in with an open mind and you should find a movie you enjoy as a watchable but not a classic flick.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|Why people is complaining about PoS becoming political? They have always been! This record is fantastic and well deserving of being The Perfect Element Part II!

But i will forgive them if they say the truth about gringos like in that song!! GREAT album!!!
849759682X|5.0|To sci-fi fans, Frank Herbert needs no introduction, but for those who may be new, one is probably necessary.   <br /> <br />Frank Herbert was a professional writer and photographer who had a penchant for science fiction.  His first story, somewhat prescient, was about a nuclear submarine being used for warfare under the Arctic, a story he wrote in the 1950's.   <br /> <br />Dune was not Herbert's first novel, but is his most famous.  It is basically an epic in the same sense War and Peace or Lord of the Rings are epics, though this epic is set to a science fiction theme, rather than history or fantasy.   <br /> <br />The novel is set in the distant future when humanity has mastered interstellar space flight and has colonised many planets throughout the galaxy.  Humanity has not achieved this easily though; first there was the Butlerian Jihad, a war against a hostile A.I. civilisation which had enslaved humanity (which is told in the novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson based on Frank Herbert's unpublished notes on the series) and then a massive series of religious wars, caused in part by the advent of FTL spaceflight and partly by the stresses of the anti-machine jihad.   <br /> <br />Human spaceflight however has come at a cost; FTL travel throughout the universe can only be achieved by 'folding space', a process which requires vastly enhanced states of human conciousness that are capable of performing the incredibly complex mathematical calculations necessary for FTL spaceflight and navigation.  These enhanced states can only be accomplished by consuming a substance known as 'The Spice', a hyper-psychotropic substance that completely alters human conciousness and physiology.   <br /> <br />The only known supply of Spice in the universe is the planet Dune, also known as Arrakis.  Since Spice is such a valuable, rare and essential commodity, without which the human interstellar empire would collapse, human politics in the period of time in which the novelis set revolves around the control of its production, extraction, harvesting and trade.  Many wars have been fought over control of Arrakeen spice, however by the time the novel begins, a sort of uneasy stability reigns.   <br /> <br />The political control of human civilisation rests with a complex arrangement between the Spacing Guild (a Guild of humans who navigate foldspace using spice), The Houses of the Laandsrad (the most powerful stellar empires in the galaxy), dominated by Houses Atreides and Harkonen and by the Emperor Shaddam the IVth, and by the religious order known as the Bene Gesserit, whose aim is to create a superhuman being with super-cognitive powers, including the ability to accurately forsee the future.   <br /> <br />The focal character is Paul Atreides, son of Leto Atreides, the King of House Atreides.  House Atreides control the harvesting of Spice on Arrakis and the lucrative power and wealth that flows from it.  But Baron Harkonen is determined to unseat this dominance and destroy the Atreides, who are mortal enemies of the Harkonens.   <br /> <br />The story unfolds with an almost Byzantine complexity in terms of politics and power relationships, intruige, war, and betrayal.  Towards the end however, both the Harkonens and the Emperor himself are undone by the hidden power and strength of the native people of Arrakis, Sufi-Buddhist warriors called the Fremen, under Paul's leadership and military skills.  However, this is not the end but only the beginning of the story, one which will unfold over thousands of years and across entire planets.   <br /> <br />The book is a staggering achievement of vision, scope and complexity.  Herbert manages to create a convincing set of worlds with their unique politics, religions, civilisations and history told in a way that is plausible and fascinating.  While hard SF fans may be dissapointed at the lack of details over things such as space folding, soft SF fans will no doubt be fascinated with topics such as interplanetary politics and economics, interstellar diffusion of religions, the effect of drugs on human conciousness and its possibilities, and extra-ordinary forms of human cognition such as prescience.  In terms of world builders Herbert is one of the most imaginative and inventive, and make the Dune series one of the boldest and most successful attempts ever made in science fiction to create a convincing universe where humans have made it to the stars and carried the human condition with them.   <br /> <br />This book is a must read for any serious fan of SF, hard or soft, and will be enjoyed by anyone at multiple levels.

1582701709|1.0|Occasionally you come across some things so ludicrous as to be unbelievable.  The so called 'Secret' television series, slickly advertised and marketed, is just such a thing.      The Secret purports to unravel the 'Secret', the mysterious key to power, wealth and success known through the ages from the ancient Egyptians through to Greek Philosophers to the medieval Catholic Church to people like the Freemasons and the American Transcendentalists (most particularly Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Thoereau, who are quoted out of context at various points).  The secret is then alleged to have been known by great luminaries of the scientific revolution, from Galileo to Newton to Albert Einstein, and finally by several obscure self-made entrepenuers and millionaires in 19th and 20th century America.      After some flashy and intruiging imagery suggesting a great hidden knowledge so dangerous people have killed for it through history, a procession of celebrities, televangelists, 'metaphysicians', philosophers and businesspeople are wheeled out, claiming the 'Secret' has changed their lives for the better in infinitely many ways.  During these interviews we also see flashy images of expensive sports cars, palatial houses, people in corporate boardrooms, and other images suggesting great personal success, health, happiness and material wealth all flow like a river from the well of the 'Secret.'        So what is the secret?  The secret begins with a genie appearing from a bottle, asking what your wish is.  The chorus of gurus then says the secret is essentially wishing for whatever you want, and when this happens, the universe begins to put into motion the necessary events and means by which every whim and desire of yours, no matter how grand, will be met.  This is based on the so called 'law of attraction' where it is argued your thinking about something brings it into being, and attracts things to you which are either good or bad depending on whether your thoughts are 'negative' or 'positive.'  Of course many analogies to the laws of nature are given, from gravity to quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, to support this purported law.  Because whatever we think brings the universe and its contents into existence, in principle anything we want or desire can become reality itself.  A 'thought experiment' is then given as an example is given where a young boy sees a beautiful but expensive bike in a shop window.  He wishes to have the bike, and after some minor frustrations and waiting, his wish comes true...because he wished it and because of the law of attraction.     While in itself the philosophical idea behind this (idealism) is well known in both classical and modern philosophy, and to an extent also in Eastern Philosophy, the general aim of philosophy both East and West was never to make as much money or career success as possible, but to understand the nature of mind, the world, and reality.  In fact, Buddha, one of the most refined ancient Philosophers of Mind, came up with a notion of mind in a lot of ways similar to the so called 'Law of Attraction' but then derived the conclusion all phenomena which appear to the mind are basically empty.  Buddha then in his teaching most strongly condemned all forms of greed, desire, lust, and attachment to material possessions, because in his eyes this ignored the true nature of things and also brought out the worst vices in mankind; Buddha would be especially disgusted at the notion that you think yourself into being poor or thought on your own efforts can cure you of cancer or serious handicaps.  A similar position was reached by many other great idealist Philosophers, such as Plato, Augustine, Eriugena, Aquinas, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Plotinus, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Descartes, and Edmund Husserl.      Changing the way we think does not change fundamental reality, a point many philosophers and scientists emphasize; changing the way we think, or rather removing our prejudices andpreconceptions which blind us to the true nature of the world, including our tendency to be greedy and unsatisfied with what we currently have,  allows us to cope with reality as it is, and transfigure it into a beautiful everyday richness.      In my view the Secret is designed to tell us what we wish to hear and says there is an easy, trouble-free way to make our wishes come true.  In so far as serious philosophy or religion goes, this is a complete cop out, a retreat from the problem of existence, as Sartre might put it, and from the viewpoint of the practical life, suggests absurdly we can reach wealth, power, status and glory without virtue, hard work, sensible practical planning, and individual merit.  Any reasonably intelligent person with common sense and some capacity for reflection can see how absurd most of the claims made in the 'Secret' are, and while even someone like John Stuart Mill said the aim of human life is happiness, material plenty and pleasure, he would also be jolted in the way philosophy and learning (for which he had great respect and considered to constitute the happy life) are debased in this show into mere sophistry and wishful thinking.      Caveat emptor, in so far as this Secret is concerned.
1582701709|4.0|I saw the movie and I really liked the positive message but I didn't like the creepiness of the sound and the picture they had through out the movie.  I aways find scary movies or anything that makes you fearful to be a negative energy.  I used to like scary movies but now I avoid it because it does give you negative energy.  Think about the nightmares you usually get after watching it. Doesn't that tell you something?  So with this movie trying to send out positive message and they used all the dark images and some black and white pictures of the past, I find it disturbing. I understand that they were trying to make a movie that makes you think it's cool but surely they could've done without those creepy images and background noise.  I saw it the first time and it was ok but then to watch it second time around I started noticing those images more vividly as being errie and what's with the background creepy voices that you get from horror movies?  Anyway, I had to turn it off and now I don't ever want to watch it again. I will just read the book. Above all, the messages are positive and can be rewarding for people who need to understand the positive mentality.  There are few flaws such as you can't become a Trillionaire or bring back the dead no matter how much you think about it, right?
B0007TKNII|2.0|The production values and direction for the film are exceptional, unfortunately the miscasting of a musicless miscreate leading man in Butler sinks this film. I purchased this DVD for Christmas for my wife because she loves the musical so much. I have seen sections of the musical on video with Michael Crawford and although not a great singer at least he can do more than shout lyrics. Gerard Butler is absolutely horrendous in this role since it's obvious he can't carry a tune even in a bucket.  Geez, they dubbed Minnie Driver, why not dub this catawahling catastrophe?  Shouting a song is not singing. Horrid.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Although many have called this movie a bit slow, I thought the pace of it was quite good. A romance and mystery at the same time, the story follows the life of a magician named Eisenheim, a boy from modest backgrounds that falls desperately in love with a girl named Sophie, who recipricates, but also happens to be the daughter of royalty.<br /><br />Banned from seeing his love, Eisenheim disappears for many years, only to return as the greatest illusionist of his time. Sophie is, at the time of his return, involved with a prince, who insists on learning the answers to all of Eisenheim's illusions.<br /><br />Although I am afraid any more detail would give the twists away, I will say that there are clues everywhere, and although rather difficult, the mystery is solvable. I recommend you give it a try.

B00006J9OT|5.0|For those reviewers trying to compare Diana Krall to people like Sarah Vaughn... forget it!!! She's not Vladamir Horowitz or the Pope either!!! To give her a low rating based on that is absurd.  <br /> <br />This is a very very good Jazz band and Diana Krall swings. She plays well and she does an incredible amount with the voice that the maker gave here. The album is very enjoyable to me and it's a good place to start if you want to hear Diana Krall.  <br /> <br />Is she great? That question is so subjective and who cares anyway. One reviewer suggested that calling her great was disrespectful to the great Jazz singers. Popular singers like Diana bring attention to Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn and Sinatra etc... People start with Diana and move backward from there... 5 stars from this reviewer!!!
B0000UJL96|5.0|The Star Trek movies have had a roller coaster trend.  There was the first movie which was like the \\"2001\\" of the series (which is adequately acceptable - I still like it).  Then came the classic Wrath of Khan, and its pristine follow-ups of Search for Spock, and Voyage Home.  Star Trek the Final Frontier wasn't great at all, let's leave it at that.  So came this movie to redeem Kirk and crew. <br /> <br />The movie literally begins with a BANG.  Sulu is off as captain of the Excelsior (a ship he's always craved), and along the way his ship gets in a tangle with a shockwave of an exploded Klingon moon - which is essentially the most vital resource the Klingons have.  Months later at a briefing, Capt. Kirk finds himself vouched and volunteered by Spock to escort the Klingon chancellor to Earth for a peace conference.  Keep in mind Kirk is not too fond with the Klingons, especially since they killed his son some time ago.  The two meet up for a dinner aboard the Enterprise , which doesn't go too well exactly.  Then later on after it's over, the Klingon ship is fired on, leaving it with no gravity, then two figures beam on the ship and kill the Chancellor.  Kirk and Enterprise are left with the blame and Kirk and Dr. McCoy are arrested, held trial, and sentenced to life on a tundra mining outpost.  While there, Spock and crew look over the Enterprise to find all the bread crumbs that would lead to those responsible for the attack.  It seems all around there are those, from Starfleet, to Klingon that don't exactly go well with the idea of peace moving forward, and they'll do what it takes to prevent it - even if it involves a deadlier Bird of Prey, and another assassination attempt. <br /> <br />Yeah, a sci-fi movie not only being true to being sci-fi, but getting even more serious.  All of the performers of the Enterprise crew, as well as Sulu (who is now a captain as mentioned), play their revered characters as they are known to be.  Plus, add the robust performance by Christopher Plummer as the rogue Klingon Chang, which easily rivals Patrick Stewarts Picard in different dimensions. <br /> <br />The picture transfer is really a marvel, and most interesting on the widescreen frame being different - but that's because the movie was shot in 70MM.  About every scene looks amazing.  Same goes for the 5.1 sound, it has an aural depth to it.  Everything in the scene is directionally placed.  Special note goes out to the Cliff Eidelman, whose score is not only different in all regards in the movies, but truly a gem to hear on how it sets the mood just right. <br /> <br />I'm not going to go deep into the extras, there's plenty to go around and ask for seconds. <br /> <br />That said, I put my endorsement on this kickass DVD.  It's one of those special editions that is treated very special. <br />
074356619X|1.0|The \\"secret\\" is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever been recommended to watch. If you like infomercials this is the movie for you. Random personalities talk of the greatest minds in history using this technique of positive thought, which is obviously made up, to gain wealth and power. Such personalities include visionarys, MBA's, and CEO's. Let's recap; If I think about something hard enough, I'll get it. No kidding, If you want a bike badly enough you'll buy one or maybe receive one as a gift. It's called a self-fulfilling prophecy. Only for those who have nowhere else to turn.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Deep. Thought provoking. Loved the slow speed roll through the midwestern countryside accompanied by violin.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|What a great movie!!!  This one is so interesting, I actually wanted to see more.  But, I understand the movie could only be so long.  The characters, the dialogue, the music, the action, the drama, this movie has EVERYTHING!!  I like the fact that it didn't have to stoop to a lot of nudity either.  The language, well, I wish it wasn't as vulgar, but I understand in that life it's as common as any dialogue between people.<br /><br />It causes you to realize the reality that these things are possible and they are.  As incredible as the scenario may be, it's definitely plausible.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to those who like the mob stories and gritty crime dramas that really draw you in and tell a story you won't forget!!!
B000LC55F2|4.0|Having just watch the Illusionist I decided to buy this movie as I missed both of them at the theater. While I find the Illusionist a better movie than The Prestige, both are good movies well worth having. I found this movie a bit hard to follow as you really have to pay attention. This is defiantly a movie that you have to watch multiple times to see something you missed the last time due to it's fast pace. If you like magic then this is a must have movie.
1582701709|1.0|This is the stupidest book I've ever tried to read.  A real waste of money.  Thankfully, I didn't buy it -- but SOME poor sucker did.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have been a fan of James Bond since it started. I did not think that you could come up with another James Bond and with the same stories and make it interesting. Not so here. I was biased when I went in to the movie theater but not when I left. This Bond has an edge to him. I have to say this is the best Bond yet. When watching the movie you will think it is predictable but you will be in for a pleasant surprise. I already have this on pre-order.
1582701709|1.0|Not to be pessimistic, but this book looks like pseudo-spiritual feel-good trash.  Humanity has been searching for Truth, for meaning in their lives, for centuries, and Byrne is arrogant enough to say she found the answer?  I not even going near this book.  People will buy it, people will say it changed their lives, Byrne will retire early, the excitement will wear off, and then the publishers will be scrambling to look for some other book with all the answers. <br /> <br />I know this sounds like a tirade, and I'm sorry for that.  But let's use our heads and be critical thinkers.  The secret is this book will make a splash, but then the ripples will slowly disappear.
B000EWBNMS|3.0|The premise of this whodunnit is promising, and even more exciting because it's based on a real person. A woman who is very psychic grows into her ability to communicate with dead people, and thus is able to help the police solve crimes. The acting is superb. And the character of Allison grows with subtlety and humor.<br /><br />However, I could do without the heavy dose of graphic violence that usually appears not only in the opening sequences, but also throughout each episode. This could have been a wonderful show, but I had to shut my eyes because the images were so brutal and disturbing. These are Allison's nightmares, hardly what I'd call entertaining. Keep your kids away from this, or you'll be waking up in the middle of the night to soothe THEIR nightmares.<br /><br />If you can stand the violence, the psychological sophistication and acting make it a worthwhile show. But I think this series could still be effective without the graphic violence.
1582701709|1.0|While The Secret may bring wealth to those selling these books and DVDs, don't expect it to do the same for you.<br /><br />I will grant you that the power of positive thinking can help people cope with difficulty and may improve their lives.  This, however, is common knowledge.  You don't need to purchase this book to learn that.<br /><br />Other than this simple lesson (worthy of 1 star), this book's main value is that of a coaster or door stop.  Save your money.
B000002KAT|5.0|I bought this album when it was first released in 1968.I still have it.I do not play it anymore.I play the cd.I had been a hard core jazzman up to that point.It amazed me.I could not stop playing it.Over and over I played it,finding something new with every listen.The lyrics,the music,unbelievable the mixing of the instruments.How someone so young could have so much confidence in his ability as a poet and a musician.To me,this is hands down the best album to ever come out of the 6o`s. I believed that then and I still do today.I still listen to it reguarly and it still amazes me.The original album goes with me when I head for the other side.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|This album is experimental, as usual, and does not fail to hit the mark in every way. POS will never sit still and repeat past successes - So you must listen with an open mind and not compare to prior albums. I sense that the poor reviews are a result of folks jusy not \\"getting it\\". For example, Disco Queen is NOT a disco song - It is Daniel pushing the envelope again, and with great success. It is songs like this, as well as the others, that merit an easy 5 star rating for Scarsick.
B000EULJLU|5.0|There were some high points on this album and other not so high points.  Even though some hardcore Tool fans are criticizing this album, overall, it was worth a purchase, and is very enjoyable.  I just think that there are a few parts that don't add to the brilliance.  I am giving this album 5 stars instead of four because it grew on me, and I can't give it 4.5 stars.  Call me generous.  Don't listen to the one star reviewers.  Check out 10,000 Days for yourself.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This enchanting film is one I look forward to watching with my children , when they arrive , that is . 2014 addition - they arrived and our currently 6 year old loves it.    As musicals are almost an extinct format nowadays , we can all enjoy this incredibly funny film for simply that , together with the humor that comes naturally out of the story itself .    This film is for all future generations to enjoy again and again on DVD    - we are likely to watch these films at home after all , as sadly they don't get shown at the multiplexes !    Updating this review in 2013 - our little boy has now watched this film and loved it, especially the Lina Lamont character - after all, who can forget HER?
B00005JPKC|5.0|Has a greater indictment of war ever been made?  Perhaps Gallipoli or Breaker Morant, Das Boot, but, I don't think so.  I came out of the theatre stunned into silence.  Before this movie I have never felt a glimmer of sympathy for the Japanese in WWII.  This is a poignant film that speaks to the horror of all wars and the unity of all mankind.
B000LC55F2|4.0|\\"The Prestige\\" is a psychological thriller set circa 1900 in the world of master magicians who compete to create the most astonishing illusions using the latest technologies that will amaze and captivate audiences. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is a masterful showman who has left a privileged upbringing behind to pursue a career in magic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a brilliant, daring magician from humble beginnings who will sacrifice anything to be truly great at his craft. An on-stage tragedy when the two men were young apprentice magicians sets in motion a bitter, obsessive rivalry that turns violent. When Angier's ingenieur Mr. Cutter (Michael Caine), who designs and constructs his magic tricks, is confounded by Borden's great \\"Transported Man\\" trick, Angier sends his assistant and mistress Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to infiltrate Borden's operation and learn his secrets.<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" was adapted from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. Some obvious flaws in logic and a plot and structure that are perhaps overcomplicated prevent me from giving this film 5 stars. A persistent and pivotal question over which knot was tied doesn't make sense, for example, because the characters could easily see the knot. The great illusion that brings the story to its startling conclusion also defies logic.  But \\"The Prestige\\" is a very effective -and very atmospheric- thriller. Christian Bale's performance is especially intriguing. The depth of Borden and Angier's obsession with their secrets and with each other is compelling. Scientist Nicola Tesla (David Bowie), creator of alternating current, has a small role in this intricate plot. And although I think that Tesla is one of several extraneous elements that might have been better left out, I am glad to see his genius get a little publicity.<br /><br />Curiously, two 2006 films were set in the culture of turn of the century conjurers: \\"The Prestige\\" and \\"The Illusionist\\". The two films are about entirely different things, but both are clever, effective thrillers that internalize the concept of illusion, assiduously misdirecting the audience until the right moment arrives to reveal themselves. Though imperfect, these two magic movies are among the most entertaining and provocative in my recent memory. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. See them both. They're not redundant. \\"The Prestige\\" is a gripping psychological thriller. \\"The Illusionist\\" is historically inspired and visually and aurally entrancing. One pits science against the magic arts, while the other places science within them.<br /><br />The DVD (Buena Vista 2007): \\"The Director's Notebook\\" is a 5-part featurette that includes interviews with director Christopher Nolan, the cast, novelist Christopher Priest, and screenwriter Jonathan Nolan about Victorian era magicians, the film's visual style, themes, and Nicola Tesla. \\"The Art of The Prestige\\" includes publicity stills, photos of costumes and sets, behind-the-scenes stills, and 9 examples of poster art that appeared in the movie. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.rent things, but both are clever, effective thrillers that internalize the concept of illusion, assiduously misdirecting the audience until the right moment arrives to reveal themselves.

B000GFLAI0|4.0|This album shows that creativity and taking risk remains strong  with Dylan as displayed in the wide spectrum of music he gives us.... hillbilly rock, country, folk, etc.  Thunder on the Mountain is literally a great \\"driving\\" song..... crank'er up!
B000JU7NCE|3.0|On the plus side, this IS a great set list. The Cure are wise to haul out  older songs like the Drowning Man and M. But I'll be the d-bag to just come right and say it - keyboards are sorely missed in many of these tracks. Many of these songs sound like they are being performed by a Cure cover band, and try as he might, Porl Thompson can't cover all the holes in the sound with all that guitar noodling. Very simply put, it's like eating cake that doesn't have icing on it - it's very good, but you KNOW something crucial is missing. And by the way, the camera work in this DVD is as bad as many people are saying it is, with a distinct \\"bootleg\\"-ish look and feel to it. Having said that, the Cure have never been terribly visually exciting anyway, so that alone doesn't flaw this set. I dock this DVD because of the before mentioned lack of keys , and because of the glaring lack of any bonus footage -  interviews or some backstage things would have been nice, and I have searched in vain for those dreadful \\"easter eggs\\" that normally crop up on DVD releases like these. As it is, I can't rate this as high as the \\"Trilogy\\" DVD but I can recommend it for fans of the Cure.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|All I have to say is that this album rocks. The music selection is great. Their cov er of No Ordinary Love by Sade is one of my favorite covers ever done. Simple Man could of been done a little bit better but i'm sure Lynard Skynard would of been proud. They rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|A complex and beautiful record.. In my mind, not as consistently good as \\"By the Way\\" but more varied, with everything from rock to funk to acoustic.  This double CD contains some of their finest work... my favorites are Snow (Hey oh), Slow Cheetah, Dani California, Warlocks and Charlie... and, of course,  \\"Tell Me Baby\\", which could be their best song ever (with all due respect to \\"Give it Away\\", \\"Scar Tissue\\" and \\"Under the Bridge\\").  If they had taken the \\"top 14\\" and made a single CD, it would be one of the best of all time. <br />

1582701709|5.0|\\"The Secret\\" (The Law of Attraction) isn't \\"anything new\\" as I've heard some say; but in \\"reality\\" what is? I believe humanity (most of humanity) has reached a level of consciousness that has brought Rhonda Byrne's book (and others like it) into existence. Mankind is reaching the point in his creation/evolution to where he/she is ready to learn how to exercise his/her Authority and Dominion over their life in spiritual ways; thusly helping to create a more peaceful and loving world.    As for Jesus...    Jesus didn't create the \\"Law of Attraction\\", the \\"law\\" was in existence  before God breathed life into the nostrils of man or (Son of man); or before man crawled out of the sea.  Jesus understood the Law of Attraction (before it was termed LoA) via \\"divine wisdom\\"... and he knew how to activate this great law, according to the Bible.  What Jesus taught to the people of his time wasn't necessarily \\"new\\", but it was revolutionary...hence his crucifixion later.  Jesus challenged the people of his time to think for themselves, and to claim the life abundant; which the authorities (or mainstream) of that time wasn't going for.    It seems that whenever mankind is challenged to think \\"outside the box\\", or beyond the realm he/she can perceive with their ordinary senses; the opposers want to \\"gnash their teeth\\" or scream \\"heresy\\"!      The truth is some will embrace \\"The Secret\\" because they have reached a point in their lives to where its truth resonates with them (and there is nothing wrong with this).  Some will ignore it and lead their lives as they always have (and there is nothing wrong with this).  Some will seek to \\"crucify\\" its message because they are afraid, ignorant, or it challenges a long held belief system (but as Jesus said, with great compassion nearing the end of his Passion: \\"Forgive them, for they know not what they do\\").    I am blessed to own \\"The Secret\\"; and look at it as a magnificent book (and DVD) to further enlighten the consciousness of man; tofurther our wisdom and understanding of God/The Universe/Ourselves.    If God is Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient...why do we limit his/her (or perhaps even a Presence's) power to a few Holy books of the past?  God is alive, and \\"his\\" ways to reach the hearts and minds of men/women (and the rest of life), are limitless.    If you're ready for this simple (yet profound and powerful) teaching...\\"The Secret\\" is for you.
0385508476|5.0|After reading many versions of the Diary of Anne Frank, it was great to finally see the original version Anne herself wrote, with no edits. The first part of this book details the verification process when the authenticity of Anne's diary was challenged. The second part takes Anne's original diary, her own edited version that she began just before discovery, and the published version that Otto edited and compares them in small sections together. Its very well documented and if this is an area of interest to you, I highly recommend it.
630460291X|5.0|`Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves' released in '91 is a terrific re-visioning of the Robin Hood mythos and by far my favorite Kevin Costner film.<br /><br />Costner delivers a strong and likeable performance as Robin and Alan Rickman does what he does best in the role of his adversary, the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham. The film also contains a solid performance by Morgan Freeman as Moorish warrior and Robin's companion Azeem. His inclusion was a wonderful addition to the usual storyline.<br /><br />The films excellent production values; beautiful cinematography, wonderful period costumes, romantic and uplifting music, inventive storyline and superior cast make for an exciting adventure all around. One of the major complaints most reviewers have with this movie seem to center on Kevin Costner portrayal of Robin of Locksley. Maybe Costner doesn't quite possess the bravado and charming persona of the great Errol Flynn, but he makes a superior Robin Hood nonetheless.
0143034901|5.0|This is one of my favorite novels.  I have recommended this book to several friends and have given many copies of the book as gifts. I enjoyed the writing style, the multiple story lines, and the author's wonderful ability to take a reader over a 700 page journey with more than a dozen well developed characters. As many reviewers have noted, this is one of those stories you never want to end. This is a must read for anyone who loves books.
B00005JPO7|5.0|Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a celebrated East German playwright, doesn't like the way his new play has turned out. Despite the fact the lead actress is his girlfriend, Christa (Martina Gedeck); he feels the play's director lacks the subtlety the material requires. The Cultural Minister congratulates Georg on the play and the artist asks him once again to lift the blacklist on his preferred director. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a member of East Germany's Secret Police, listens to this exchange and quietly suggests to the ministers that Dreyman should be watched. Wiesler is put in charge of the operation and the Secret Police soon have every inch of his apartment bugged. As Wiesler listens, he begins to get to know more and more about the playwright and begins to respect and like the artist. But his superiors become impatient and want some information about an article published anonymously in West Germany; they suspect Georg wrote it and need the evidence.<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Others\\", written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, is Germany's official entry in this year's Academy Awards. The film was just released in a number of theaters and represents an Oscar worthy film.<br /><br />Set in 1984, the film presents a microcosm of what life was like in the former East Germany. The Stasi, the Secret Police employed vast numbers of employees and secret informants to keep track of and report on the activities of the citizens who are under suspicion; an incredibly large number of people set out to spy on and watch a relatively small population and when this happens, a lot of innocent people are caught in the crossfire. And the people of East Germany knew this system existed, which is why they look through the viewfinders of their doors, but if they see something suspicious, they remain silent. If they raise a fuss, and the Secret Police are involved, they will probably bring suspicion upon themselves. They may even disappear.<br /><br />Georg's neighbor, a single woman, watches Wiesler and his men enter the playwright's department. After they finish, he senses the neighbor is watching and threatens her, in a way meant to ensure she remains quiet. This is typical of their methods and helps establish how nefarious this group is.<br /><br />As the State's celebrated playwright, he enjoys a certain amount of celebrity and is reluctant to do anything to threaten that. But Georg knows this system exists as well, even though he seems reluctant to embrace it. He wants to make some waves, cause some changes, because he comes to realize the system is unfair, so he writes an article and enlists a West German to transport it and publish it in Der Spiegel. As soon as the article is published, the East German government is in an uproar and insists they find the culprit. But Wiesler's superiors suspect Georg and Wiesler doesn't want to give him up so quickly. Thus begins an elaborate, well-plotted, subtle game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />This isn't the stuff of American spy films. Everything is fairly low key, yet none-the-less fascinating. Possibly more fascinating because we believe much of this is actually based on real things that could have and probably did happen.<br /><br />Georg initially doesn't believe he has been bugged, why would they go to the trouble, he toes the line, barely. But his friends are more cautious, they have had first hand experiences with the Secret Police and are suspicious of everyone, even him. Events soon lead him to believe their suspicions and he moves with an air of caution from that point forward, but he is unwilling to believe their suspicions about who may have reported him.<br /><br />Sebastian Koch does a great job of portraying an artist who may not be happy with his current way of life, but he isn't so unhappy he is willing to make radical changes. This is the way of life he is familiar with, has grown up with, and is comfortable with, so he accepts it. As he begins to listen to his friends, share their suspicions, his feelings change slowly and he still holds out hope that perhaps they are wrong.<br /><br />But the most interesting performance in the film comes from Ulrich Muhe. We first meet Captain Wiesler as he leads a seminar for new employees of the secret police, letting them listen to the tape of an interrogation lasting 40 hours. In the end, Wiesler got the information he wanted, but he imparts other information to the students. As he lectures, one of the students raises a question and Wiesler makes a mark next to his name, to remember to have him disciplined. As Wiesler learns more and more about Georg Dreyman, a subtle change happens, and Muhe shows this in a subtle way. His expressions change slightly, showing us how the knowledge he has learned while listening to this artist's personal life has changed him. The change becomes more and more pronounced throughout, in subtle ways, and Muhe does a great job of presenting the conflicts in this character. A life long believer in the Secret Police, he secretly listens to what Georg and his friends have to say and it changes him, causing him no little amount of conflict.<br /><br />Martina Gedeck is also very good as Christa-Maria Sieland, the preeminent actress in East Germany, as much as that would get her in that climate. She is in a relationship with Georg, a famous playwright, and they are a good couple and she is happy. But she has a secret and the secret may threaten her life and the life of her boyfriend.<br /><br />There are no car chases, no gun fights, little of what we have come to expect in an American spy film. \\"The Lives of Others\\" presents a more subtle, cerebral, but no less suspenseful view of what life was really like in East Germany, in the Early 80s. Throughout the film, we get small glimpses of techniques we wholeheartedly believe were actually used in the Cold War. As Wiesler lectures the class, he admonishes them to remember to collect the seat cover; it will provide the dogs with a suspect's scent. We then watch as he collects the fabric seat cover from the chair used during the 40 hour interrogation and place it in a labeled glass jar, ready should the suspect ever attempt to escape to the West. These little, more subtle moments are all the more scary because they are more real. Did these things really happen? Probably. If they did, this is a society of fear and suspicion and must have been extremely unpleasant for any and all.<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" is a very good film providing a peek at what life was really like behind the Iron Curtain.ns to listen to his friends, share their suspicions, his feelings change slowly and he still holds out hope that perhaps they are wrong. <br /> <br />But the most interesting performance in the film comes from Ulrich Muhe.

0312330871|5.0|This is a MUST read for any Agatha Christie fan. She weaves a tale of mystery, murder, and betrayal that is full of suspense at every turn and twist of the plot. Just when you think that you have finally solved the mystery you are shocked with the unsuspecting truth. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery.  If you have never read an Agatha Christie mystery this is a good one to start with. This was the very first Agatha Christie book I read, at the age of 12.  I have read it atleast 10 times and still continue to be amazed at the end of the book.
B00005JPFQ|3.0|I'll be honest. I had never even heard of the character \\"Ghost Rider\\" until I read about the film being made. I will be unable to tell you how closely this film follows the story of this character, as set forth by Marvel Comics. I can tell you whether the film works or not.<br /><br />It does and it doesn't. There are a number of interesting ideas and themes in \\"Ghost Rider\\", but there are an equal number of things that don't work. Ultimately, it is a wash.<br /><br />Young Johnny Blaze learns his father, a stunt motorcyclist who is teaching him the tricks of the trade, has cancer and a strange man (Peter Fonda) appears offering to save the young man's dad. All Mephistopheles wants in return is Blaze's soul. Blaze doesn't quite believe the man, but signs anyway. Dad does get better, but events happen and Blaze rides off into the sunset, leaving his girlfriend, Roxanne behind. Years later, the adult Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) travels around the country completing one stunt more elaborate than the next, becoming famous in the process. Eventually, Mephistopheles comes to collect on the contract. If Blaze can banish Blackheart (Wes Bentley, \\"American Beauty\\") to hell, the devil will tear up the contract and Johnny can have his soul back. Roxanne (Eva Mendes) returns to town, a television reporter working her way through the ranks. Unwilling to help the devil, Johnny finds he transforms, at night and in the presence of evil, into Ghost Rider, a motorcycle riding skeleton engulfed in flame who rides a motorcycle covered in fire. Eventually, Blackheart realizes he has a formidable foe in Ghost Rider and decides to use Roxanne as bait.<br /><br />The film begins with a voice over by Sam Elliot, recounting an old legend about a small village in Mexico the devil wanted to claim. He sent his bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider, a cowboy on a horse, to claim the contract for their souls, but the Ghost Rider realized how powerful this document was and never turned it over. Sam Elliot's gravely voice does two things immediately; it telegraphs that this film will be more of a fable, maybe even a tall tale (remember his voice over during the Coen Brothers' \\"Big Lebowski\\"?) and it also points to a definite Western influence to the story. When the story moves to present day, much of it takes place in Dallas and many small influences of Texas and Southwest design pop up here and there. In this way, they are making Johnny Blaze and Ghost Rider a sort of modern day cowboy.<br /><br />These elements add a lot of interest to the story, taking it beyond a normal comic book superhero.<br /><br />There is a lot of humor throughout the story and much of this is presented in a tongue and cheek manner. This doesn't exactly work, because it makes Cage seem even more jokey and unbelievable than he already is. These films are much better when they take the characters and their action seriously. Yes, I realize we are talking about a man who becomes a motorcycle riding skeleton who battles the devil's son. But if the characters aren't taking the story seriously, how is the viewer supposed to do this? If the characters take the action seriously, the viewer will believe the story, no matter how outlandish. The \\"Spider Man\\" films are a prime example of this. At one point, both Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes say a little quip and then stare at the camera, punctuating the joke, much like a drummer backing up a stand-up comedian. In most superhero films, these quips are played serious and elicit more laughter because of this, because they are unexpected.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage has never been the most subtle actor. Given the opportunity, he frequently veers into overacting, chewing the scenery and mugging furiously for the camera. When he makes a quip, or steals a glance at the camera doing a virtual wink wink, the character becomes jokey. At one point, Cage stares at the heavens and starts screaming, as he transforms into Ghost Rider, grimacing, mugging furiously for the camera, reminding us that we are watching a comic book character.<br /><br />In many ways, this film reminded me of the old \\"Doc Savage\\" film starring Ron Ely and the more I think about, the more the two films resemble each other. While \\"Ghost Rider\\" is nowhere near as bad as \\"Doc Savage\\", the two films are played for laughs, with the lead actors doing some serious scenery chewing. Both films have a pervasive wink wink nudge nudge feel about them. But Cage is a better actor and helps the character retain any seriousness, any gravitas he may have. It isn't much, but it helps make this film a little better.<br /><br />Eva Mendes plays Roxanne, Blaze's long unrequited love. When she returns as an adult and has a chance meeting with the new Stunt show star, she finds he hasn't changed much. At one point, Blaze confides in her and tells her what is going on. She is barely able to conceal her smirk and clearly doesn't believe him. Her character ultimately serves little purpose other than to be the damsel in distress.<br /><br />Peter Fonda plays Mephistopheles and does an interesting job of bringing the devil to life. For much of the film, he is quiet, using his words to provide the threats, speaking in soft tones. But during the moments when he is trying to be really scary, his voice changes little, making the performance more flat than scary.<br /><br />Wes Bentley returns to the big screen playing Blackheart, the devil's son, who wants to take over dear old dad's territory. After he made a splash in \\"American Beauty\\", he made a couple of films including the poorly received \\"The Four Feathers\\" and then dropped from the radar for a while. He has since made some films, none of which I have ever heard of, so this could be considered his big screen return, his first high profile film in a while. His role is interesting, but it almost seems to be done in shorthand; we certainly get the sense he is menacing, but really don't understand why he wants to take over for dear old Dad.

In \\"Ghost Rider\\", many of the scenes are created largely, maybe completely, with CGI (computer generated animation). While this helps the filmmakers create scenes they would never be able to do normally, it also provides a disconnect with the audience. Because we are basically watching cartoons, because we are watching an animated Ghost Rider ride up the side of a building on his motorcycle of fire, we lose the connection with the actors and the story. The \\"Spiderman\\" films have a similar problem; when Spiderman swings through the air on his web, we realize this is accomplished through CGI and begin to disconnect, but these sequences are brief and the animated Spiderman is very close in appearance to Tobey Maguire in the live action scenes, so we feel more of a bond to his character.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" is written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, who was behind \\"Daredevil\\", which I really liked, and \\"Elektra\\", which I never saw.

While \\"Ghost Rider\\" is nowhere near as bad as \\"Doc Savage\\", the two films are played for laughs, with the lead actors doing some serious scenery chewing. Both films have a pervasive wink wink nudge nudge feel about them. But Cage is a better actor and helps the character retain any seriousness, any gravitas he may have. It isn't much, but it helps make this film a little better. <br /> <br />Eva Mendes plays Roxanne, Blaze's long unrequited love. When she returns as an adult and has a chance meeting with the new Stunt show star, she finds he hasn't changed much. At one point, Blaze confides in her and tells her what is going on. She is barely able to conceal her smirk and clearly doesn't believe him. Her character ultimately serves little purpose other than to be the damsel in distress. <br /> <br />Peter Fonda plays Mephistopheles and does an interesting job of bringing the devil to life. For much of the film, he is quiet, using his words to provide the threats, speaking in soft tones. But during the moments when he is trying to be really scary, his voice changes little, making the performance more flat than scary. <br /> <br />Wes Bentley returns to the big screen playing Blackheart, the devil's son, who wants to take over dear old dad's territory. After he made a splash in \\"American Beauty\\", he made a couple of films including the poorly received \\"The Four Feathers\\" and then dropped from the radar for a while. He has since made some films, none of which I have ever heard of, so this could be considered his big screen return, his first high profile film in a while.

B00003CXAT|5.0|But not because it is a great script.  It's not really.  An amusement park ride from hell-is all that's on paper.  What will make this a Classic is the ground-breaking Computer graphic animation.  When I first saw this film in the theater, I was completely blown away.  Some think that this particular art as been approved upon--I don't hold that same opinion.  I see too many movies where you can tell what is real and what is fake.  This movie--everything looks REAL and for this film-there lies the horror.  Highly recommended.
B000M341QE|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  Jack Nicholson was perfect for this role and brought out the worst/best of this character. All the actors were great.  Matt Damon was at his best. Leonardo DiCaprio has grown up and decided to be an actor!  What a movie.  As a previous reviewer stated, it is wonderful for those who enjoy drama, suspense, gangster flicks and just a really good movie to keep you totally involved in what's happening on the screen.
0790729644|5.0|The combination of Eastwood, Hackman , Freeman and Harris make this one of the greatest westerns ever filmed. The Acting, Script and Cinematography are superior to almost any western I can think of. Great story with plenty of tension, action and memorable lines. Eastwood's best work in my opinion but Gene Hackman steals the film as the hardnosed sheriff of Big Whiskey, Wyoming.

0385512058|5.0|My boss gave me this book. While I love to read, any book given to you by your boss has some hidden meaning - right? Nope.  He read it and he told me right up front, there is not a reason in the world you can't be doing this stuff.  Look at it and tell me what you think - my boss said.    I got on the plane that night and started reading it. The next morning I read more and took notes. The book was telling EXACTLY how this guy keeps a network going. These were practical tips, small things, not things that took years to do.     Like simple stuff - send a thank you - right after the meeting from your laptop. Don't wait a week. I always waited a week. Then it was too late. I now send thank yous IMMEDIATELY. One idea landed a client because it demonstrated speed and service - that I would write a thank you right away.    There are a ton of ideas. Another is printing your Outlook Contact file for the city you are in and from the cab - call people and tell them \\"Hello\\" on their voice mail of course because no one actually is sitting by the phone. Just saying \\"hello, how are you, etc\\" and expecting nothing in return SHOCKs the listener.    Also - give of yourself. to that end check out a brief overview the book at josephbmurphy . com  AND - MOST IMPORTANTLY - ALWAYS try to help others when they need it. It is a great philosophy.

B00004CWO8|5.0|Words cannot express how glad I am the Adventures in Motion Pictures company made available Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake on DVD. The clich&eacute; thing to say is it's \\"amazing\\", \\"genius\\", \\"sexy\\", \\"masterful\\"... but it is all those things and more. You've never see anything like this.<br /><br />To me this \\"modern\\" Swan Lake is now the definitive classic of a classic--I can't nor do I want to imagine the swan roles as anything but manly now. The leads Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler are not only great dancers, they are great actors. Their chemistry is enjoyable to behold--and just as believable as the chemistry the traditional Swan Lake man/woman pair conveys. In fact, a male swan is more provocative *because* it's not the typical sad, delicate princess from all other versions. Instead we see something new and wonderful--a true creature of beauty, power and majesty who utterly captivates the Prince (and the audience) in every way. The male duets and solos in this show are just...wow.<br /><br />I brought this DVD to my best friend's house and I was unsure what she would think, she'd never seen any ballet let alone one so un-traditional as this. My fears were put to rest in Act II. Once the Swan appeared she didn't take her eyes away the rest of the night. We both watched in silence as if mesmerized. It was a fantasitc feeling to watch it with someone else and see them be amazed. The music helped too, Swan Lake has by far some of the best music ever written for the stage. Surely many people who aren't normally ballet watchers would appreciate this show--its humor, universal themes of forbidden love, the unique way the swans look and act like real birds, and above all else powerful manly dancing--definitely something for everyone! Share this with someone you love, quick!!!

If you are considering buying it, do it! It is filled with amazing acting, GORGEOUS singing and will prove to be amazing in every way! I could go on forever about how wonderful it is, but buy it and see for yourself! <br />
B000E97Y6A|5.0|The first hour is slow but once Skull Island is reached, Kong provides us with one thrill after another.  Here is a spoiler, Kong after shaking the crewmen from the log, rushes to save the heroine from not one, but three T-Rex terrors.  It is the greatest fight between creatures ever captured on film.  Earlier homage was paid to the original Kong by reference to a \\"Fay\\" meaning Fay Raye and that she was making a movie for \\"Cooper\\" meaning Merrian C.Cooper.  When his name is mentioned, a musical motif from the orignal briefly sounds. <br /> <br />The fight with the T-Rexes is incredible and Kong shows why he is king of that island.  The effects are terrific and when Kong ends up one on one with the lone surviving T-Rex, he approaches the beast with a huge roar, beating his chest, immediately seizing the Rex by the jaws and after struggling, kills him in identical fashion to the original.  He then stands atop the final and finally dead T-Rex and beats his chest, roaring his triumph for all to hear. <br /> <br />A great remake with good but not great casting, I rate it five stars because the action (especially the fight and the scene in the darkness under the fallen log) is superb.  A must see.
0743289412|3.0|First, let me say, I love Stephen King books.  I have read every one of them with the exception of the Dark Tower series which I just couldn't get into.  When The Cell was released after a long absence, I was thrilled.  I enjoyed that book although the ending could have been better.   <br /> <br />I bought Lisey's Story the day it was released, but it took awhile to get to the book.  When I started reading, I found myself putting the book down to do something else or not reading it at all for several days at a time.  In the past, I couldn't put his books down and had them done in no time.  This one was a hard read. <br /> <br />The first half of this book dragged.  I found it extremely boring.  The made up words and terms got very old very quickly and there really wasn't that much suspense other than a few phone calls from a crazy guy.  The book does pick up during the second half, which I was able to get through in a few days.  By that time, I just wanted to get the book done so I could read something else.  But, like The Cell, the ending could have been a lot better. <br /> <br />I gave the book 3 stars because of the second half and because it's by Stephen King.  I'm hoping that his next book will be more like his old books.  If you've never read his books, don't start with this one.  Read The Stand, Insomnia, Buick 8 and Tommyknockers.  His collaboration with Peter Straub on The Talisman and Black House are excellent too.
B000002WCJ|4.0|what a masterful performance, from one metal's most underappreciated acts. these guys are so talented, and so unheralded, that it's a crime. they are every bit the equal of groups like Maiden, Priest, Saxon and others, and never really received any fanfare. this release is a gem, and a must own for any metal fan. i'm ashamed i waited so long to write a review for this cd, as i have owned it since it was released. part 1 is very good as well. they are about even, but i give this one the nod. from track 1, \\"the invitation\\", it rolls along beautifully, and impresses throughout. the performances are impressive, and inspiring. the production, very good. a must have for any collection. take my word for it, you will enjoy this gem. trust me. peace.
B00006AVRK|4.0|I have no complaints of the content, just the opposite, being a fan of Jeeves & Wooster for many years & would normally give it five stars for entertainment value. <br />I am taking away one star for the bloated DVD packaging. <br /> <br />I have 2 reasons for buying DVD's: #1. I can't get videos any more; #2. DVD's of Complete TV series' are generally more compact than videos. <br /> <br />It was with some annoyance therefore that I realized the \\"Complete Jeeves and Wooster\\" set, which I bought to replace my old videos (which in turn I fobbed off on my sister), actually occupies more space than the videos, taking up 4 inches on my shelves. Each DVD case could easily hold 2 disks. British productions for some reason all suffer from this problem, which probably explains why they cost twice as much as American sets. <br />Compare  with the Complete Third Season Law & Order SVU, approximately the same viewing time, which occupies only one inch of space  (& cost half as much ).   <br /> <br />When you have thousands of books and hundreds of videos, space is an important consideration.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is one CD you don't need a remote in hand. The first 3 songs are great, and get tons of radio time. The other songs deserve the same credit. Good riffs, lyrics with meaning, and a good mix of hard to soft. Over and Over is a song that should not be over looked. It will be on the radio in no time to get sick of before you memorize all the other songs by heart. It's been ages I can say I play a CD through to the end with no skips. Definitely worth the time and money!! Won't be disappointed.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles 1 is a non-stop collection of The Beatles early and later songs. Every song is clear, bright as can be. And boy there is a lot of songs, 27 of them. Some of my favorites from this fantastic collection include: We Can Work it Out, Day Tripper, Get Back, Hey Jude, Help!, Eight Days a Week, Yesterday, The Long and Winding Road, Hello, Goodbye, well ok every track is my favorite. I am so happy I have this album now. I am new fan of the Beatles and I think they are the best band of all-time and I've heard a lot of bands in my 24 years. I highly recommend this jewel of a classic.
B000002KAT|5.0|What I can say about Astral Weeks, is that, to me, if you asked Van Morrison to go back in time and scrap all but one of his albums.. this is the one that he would keep. I just figure that it would be that way. This may be the one album of Vans where he isn't just a vocalist perfoming some songs... this is the one that has his heart and soul in it.<br /><br />Van Morrison left his band THEM in 1967, when a record industry big wig took him to New York to break into a solo career. Brown Eyed Girl was the single that broke his name out in the states. It seems that the wigs wanted to make Van into some sort of Neil Diamond type of character at that point.. but Van had different ideas all together.<br /><br />Astral Weeks is a labor of love, and Van had to work some magic just to get this off the ground (the #1 single with Brown Eyed Girl helped..) this record had no radio hits, yet was crucial in establishing Van Morrisons style from there on in.<br /><br />What makes this record a cut above any of his other work, is the fact that it has a raw feeling to it, yet is extremely proffesional. Van took the bar way beyond rock and roll here, dipping into folk sounds from the old country... something NO ONE was doing at the time.<br /><br />Now Van experiments with everything, but his earthly taste in music is where he gets his cred... that all began here (and its at its most fresh sounding...true these songs may not have been as pop-worthy as future go-rounds with the same style... but when a performer is really feeling it himself, you can tell the difference... at least you can on this record)<br /><br />Another thing that should be noted is that the song Madame George was being performed by Van back in his days with THEM. Older versions try it as a rock song, but here it is completely transformed into what it becomes here... and I often wonder if his constant noodling with this song is what became the basis of this record in the first place? Anyway,my point is that, if you consider yourself a fan of Van morrison and have never heard this album before, you've got some homework to do.f Van morrison and have never heard this album before, you've got some homework to do.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album is their most creative, experimental from their catalog. This was the first Beatles album I ever got. I remember someone bringing this record in to be played in my one of high school classes. And I thought to myself, so this is The Beatles, huh? I instantly fell in love with the songs, A Little Help from my Friends and Getting Better. And now I can listen to these songs any time I want. Other songs I can't get enough are: Fixing A Hole (one of Paul's best compositions), A Day in the Life, Lovely Rita, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and the title track. I'm amazed how under-produced this album and that's a good thing 'cause a lot of their previous albums were slick and glossy. George Harrison's only track on the album, is the sitar-heavy ballad, Within You Without You feels like a poem, flows really well and has a great message. I highly recommend this glorious album to any rock fan out there.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Such an excellent CD.  Have listened to this over and over so many times.  Liked this CD so much that I just ordered Volume II of \\"Legend\\".  Get it, you won't regret it!
B000IOM0WE|3.0|This film is quite interesting. The plot has its ups and downs- a futuristic society where  a minority tries to overthrow the rulers who are potrayed to be something sort of dictators. The plot evolve with some iteresting twists. But the film's highpoints are theamazing HD picture, scenery and sound that are offered which makes you happy that you bought your blu-ray and HDtv. Again nothing spectacular storywise but good to watch.
B000IHY146|4.0|First off, ignore the two, one star reviews below. Considering the reference to American Idol on the one, clearly these folks never bothered to listen to the samples to get any kind of sense of what this artist was about or what they were in for. No doubt Billie Holiday, of whom Karen Dalton is reminiscent, wouldn't make it on AI either and these two reviewers would find no value in her as well. No knock to them or AI, to each their own, it's just a different world and mindset. AI is looking for pop superstars within the context of what that means today. It has no bearing on the larger world of highly talented artists who are working other avenues with other aspirations.  It's like saying foreign or independent films are bad when you were expecting a Hollywood formulaic blockbuster. <br /> <br />Listen to the samples - that's what they are there for. My review assumes you have at least done that and you are attracted to what you heard. From that perspective, what we have here is the second of her two albums and the only one with a full band. Although the band is quite appropriate for her and producer Harvey Brooks' intentions were honorable, it doesn't work nearly as well as her first album, \\"It's So Hard To Tell Who Is Going To Love You The Best.\\" That first album is pretty much all Karen accompanying herself on acoustic without a band. The album lacks the arguably misguided attempts at contemporary (at that time) songs like How Sweet It Is and When A Man Loves A Woman, both of which are on this album, In My Own Time. It's not that she does a bad job with them, indeed, it is an admirable accomplishment to deliver contemporary, highly familiar pop songs in her own unique style and have it come across as a believable interpretation, which is what she does here. But it is simply that the setting and the song choices on her previous album are so much more natural to her. The band and arrangements aren't there to threaten the power of her vocalization - her delivery andphrasing, which show so such conviction and understanding of the material.  <br /> <br />If you listen to her and you like her style, you will like them both. Perhaps it's simply a matter of personal preference, but for the reasons stated, the first album is more intimate and satisfying, which isn't to say that this one isn't, just a little less so.
B00007K02F|2.0|After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up. The movie didn't make you want to watch more. There was no romance compared to the latest version.
1594200823|5.0|We hear it time and again we do not need animals for food, or fish for food.  Shockingly we are better off without consuming flesh.  Those who have Ranches, and Farms which produce animals for food would have you believe otherwise.  Pretty much the same way the \\"Tobacco Industry\\" claimed smoking was good for us.  It is all about money, not you, or your health.<br /><br />Even the Bible tells us flesh is no good for us as food.  Raising animals for food sucks away our natural resources.  Such as land clear cut, to make way for grazing animals, water polluted by animal wastes, then land pollution when we face the challenge of disposing of all the waste these animals produce.  Then there is the increased costs of grains used to feed said animals.  One reason why bread is over $2.00 a loaf.<br /><br />Heart disease, Cancer, Gastric disorders and the like can all be traced to the consumption of flesh foods.  Look at it this way, were we created to consume flesh as a means of sustenance we would have very sharp inward turned claws, 3\\" canines, a very rough tounge, the speed, strenght and the agility to run down our prey, then kill the same by tearing the animal's throat out with our 3\\" canines.  Next we would start by eating the animal's stomach and intestines first.  All of this raw mind you, and we would likely catch the sick the old the diseased.<br /><br />Instead of the devoured flesh lying around in our gut for years, the flesh would be instantly dissolved by very strong stomach acid, which we as humans lack.  Oh and we would not eat daily.  A good life, you think?
B00000K0E5|2.0|Pierce Brosnan, who did a spectacular job with \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\", makes a surprisingly weak James Bond.  He's almost a perfect splicing together of one of the better Bonds, Timothy Dalton, and the all-time worst, Roger Moore.  That's too bad because Brosnan is a fairly good actor.  If the producers had tried to portray Bond as Dalton and Fleming did, I think he would have done a fairly good job of it.  Once again, \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" demonstrates how good Brosnan can play cool, ruthless and debonair. <br /> <br />The movie itself isn't very good and doesn't really reference Fleming except in the title.  They took one plot element from \\"Moonraker\\" and that's about all of the Fleming you'll find in \\"Goldeneye\\".  That's too bad because a lot of Ian Fleming's ideas have never made it to the big screen. <br /> <br />The first four Bonds and OHMSS are fairly faithful to Fleming and that's about it.  \\"Live and Let Die\\", \\"Living Daylights\\" and \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" also feature a few of Fleming's ideas but not enough to make them worthwhile. <br /> <br />The new \\"Casino Royale\\" had quite a bit of Fleming in it, particularly in the center section of the film.  That's a good thing.  Remakes of \\"Live and Let Die\\", \\"Moonraker\\", and \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\" would be welcome, particularly if the screenwriters use the Fleming novels as actual launching points, as they did with \\"Casino Royale\\".   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006LSM3|5.0|I've been \\"The Beatles\\"' fan since my early teenage years. After the \\"Fab Four\\" went their separate ways, I've come from admiring Paul McCartney the most to John Lennon and then, I discovered George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and he's been the God for me since. The Quiet Beatle, \\"the Dark Horse\\" with his voice, his lyrics, his melodies, and his distinctive slide guitar style which \\"attracts me like no other\\" musician - I can't even describe what his guitar does to me. Listening to the favorite songs where George's guitar gently weeps, smiles, meditates, and talks to me personally makes me feel like standing by the ocean during the warm sunny spring day. The vibrating flowing sounds of his chords break down to the thousands golden patches of sunlight that reflect from the water surface and radiate in the air filling it with magic glow. This glow seems to reach my very soul bringing serene joy or bright sorrow.<br /><br />\\"Brainwashed\\", sadly George Harrison's posthumous project is an excellent album with all 12 songs warm, sparkling, and melodious, some of them have been among my all time favorites since I bought the CD when it was first released: \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Marwa Blues\\", \\"Never Get Over You\\", the opening song \\"Any Road\\", and of course, the one which gave the album its title, \\"Brainwashed\\". I have not listened to the CD for some time and I have been re-discovering it for the last few days. I can't get enough of it. I keep listening to the songs in my car, on my way to work and back and since it takes me 40-45 minutes of driving one way, I am able to enjoy the favorite songs over and over again. They are the songs about love, about the roads that take you anywhere, the journey of self-discovery, the look at the past and sorrow of losses - everything is in George's last album, his parting gift to us, to me. It is his last smile at the sun that he worshipped and his quiet and dignified acceptance of inevitable end, and knowledge that \\"The soul does not love. It is love itself/It does not exist. It is existence/It does not know. It is knowledge itself.\\"<br /><br />\\"Brainwashed\\" is one of the best albums of my favorite musician whose guitar will never stop gently talking to me.love itself/It does not exist.

0977326403|4.0|Having read (and enthusiastically enjoyed) Jim Collins' \\"Good to Great\\" several months ago and working on a church staff, I was pleased to discover that he wrote this monograph to draw together the conclusions of that wonderful business book and the non-business world.  I found this addition to be most helpful.<br /><br />As with all of Collins' writing, this monograph is extremely accessible.  He writes at a very intellectual level without getting overly technical.  He presents the basic premise that not everything in \\"Good to Great\\" is broadly applicable outside the business world.<br /><br />For instance, the difference between the executive authority that business leaders have is starkly contrasted with the legislative authority that leaders have in the social sector.  Because I work almost exclusively with volunteers within the church, this distinction is important and obvious to me.<br /><br />He also mentions that issues related to resources are more complicated than the relatively simplistic economic factors that exist in business.  Instead, social organizations need to consider all of the available resources, which includes people and time in addition to money.<br /><br />Despite these and other distinctions that Collins draws between the business world and the social sector, it is interesting to note that the overall principles of \\"Good to Great\\" remain valid.  For instance, the concept of Level 5 leadership remains prescriptive for high-performing leaders outside of business.<br /><br />His concluding thoughts are very insightful and instructive.  In short, he suggests that the transition from good to great happens in business and outside of business.  For my context, though the church may bring to bear particular difficulties and constraints, so does each and every institution.  The principles of greatness are common across all organizations, even if they might look slightly different.  In his words, \\"greatness is not a function of circumstance.  Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline.\\"  There is valuable wisdom in those words for those of us who work outside the business community.

0374105235|5.0|You might not be able to read this book if you didn't know it had a hopeful ending. The violence is unstaged, described in a matter-of-fact way that gives it a haunting quality; wounds bleed, women scream, babies are burned in their cribs, grown men are shot after being tortured. And it is violence perpetrated in many cases by boys, young teenagers who in their own culture are usually not considered old enough to date or wise enough to make tough decisions. <br /> <br />Ishmael Beah was born in Sierra Leone and grew up in a time of relative stability, before open rebellion began. One day he and his close buddies went to a nearby town to enter a music contest. They'd been listening to rap, imitating the poetic lyrics and the dance moves. They had a couple of home-recorded cassette tapes. While they were away, rebels swept into their home village, killing many inhabitants and forcing the rest to flee. Everyone disappeared from Ishmael's home in a few short hours, and he was never again to see most members of his close family. With no preparation, he was cut off from the life he had known and forced, with his companions, to begin a long period of constant flight, near-starvation and terror. <br /> <br />The boys knew that their time was limited. The rebels were recruiting boys to fight, raping the young girls and enslaving the elders. They were stealing all usable items and all food, burning the villages as they left. The army was likewise recruiting boys, after men were slain by rebel forces. Boys so young as to be barely able to carry a weapon were given AK-47s and told to avenge their family's deaths. They were drugged with marijuana and cocaine until their minds were as ragged as their clothes, and sent out to kill. <br /> <br />After living from day to harrowing day, Ishmael was forced to join the army. He not only shot many boys and men on the enemy side, but prided himself on being able to cut throats quickly and efficiently as part of a contest staged by the army officers. Such exercises toughened the children and inured them to the evils they were both witnessing and perpetrating every day. <br /> <br />By chance, Ishmael was among a group of boys who were taken out of the army ranks and rehabilitated, slowly, by UN and other workers who kept telling their orphan charges, \\"What you did was not your fault.\\" It took many months for Ishmael to understand and begin to believe this. At first he fought cynically and sometimes savagely against his benign captors, initially in the throes of drug withdrawal and then gripped by insane rage and a sense of powerlessness. At least as a soldier Ishmael had been esteemed a man and given responsibility. It was hard to become a boy again, to obey the kindly orphanage staff. It was harder to believe that his life had meaning or that there might be reason to hope for future happiness. <br /> <br />After a long series of reunions and a fortuitous visit to the UN in New York, Ishmael was adopted by an American aid worker and given the chance to finish high school and college. He now serves as a member of various committees and councils and speaks eloquently for the need to stop conscripting children as killers wherever such outrages occur. His talent as a lyricist grew into a talent for storytelling. A LONG WAY GONE is a story that needed to be told. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott
0393324818|5.0|This is a dramatic case-study in how information management is changing our world.  What is happening in this book is occuring with a vengance in credit and equity markets world-wide.  Both baseball and finance are worlds that have been swimming in context-less information for decades.  But both were dominated by \\"personalities\\" who worked more on prejudice than objective analysis.   <br /> <br />But as shown in this book, it is now possible to collect and analyze a vast supply of information, and find relative value in the oddest places.  Those that operate in the old way have no idea how completely los they are.  Those operating in the new way are only finding worthy competition amongst others like themselves.   <br /> <br />So in fact this book is (in my humble opinion) not really about baseball.  It is about how information management and statistical analysis are changing business in general, particularly the \\"money\\" business, and therefore changing our world.   <br /> <br />

B0009QTS1M|5.0|This movie never gets old to me, everything about it is just perfect. I actually purchased it mainly though, for the surround sound. The sound effects are great and really immerse you into the movie. A must have!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Kenny Wayne's so I knew this CD/DVD would be great and I was NOT disappointed!  Good ol' fashioned blues - I really love the CD!  Highly recommend if you are a true fan of the blues!
B000AJIF4E|1.0|While the sound quality of these headphones is very good, the poor connector design ensures that that good sound is not likely to last long.  The design were the wire is attached to the connector is flimsy and lacks rigidity.  I was concerned about this design when I first got these headphone.  Sure enough, after just five months of moderate use, the left channel drops out consistently.  If I jiggle the connector the left channel will come in and out.  Do not waste your money on these headphones.  The flaw inherent in the wire/connector attachment design needs to be fixed before I'd ever recommend these to anyone unless you are interested in buying new headphones every six months or so.
B000001DVD|5.0|I actually 'rediscovered' this album; Def Leppard's Pyromania was the first cassette I ever bought, shortly after its release (and shortly after my 13th birthday), and while I loved it, my tastes soon turned to things heavier.  Years later, a friend was playing his beat-up cassette copy of High'n'Dry and I was absolutely floored.  This is, from start to finish, a brilliant album, and like their debut On Through the Night, shows a very young and unpretentious band wanting to do nothing more than emulate and build on what bands like UFO, Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin and AC/DC had done before them.  That said, I think the AC/DC comparisons are a bit overblown; obviously, they were an influence and they did share a producer, but AC/DC, as much as I love them, could never match Def Leppard's subtlety or sense of melody.  Anyway, the production on this album is very full and clean, yet manages to retain the young band's rawness and energy - note the guitar feedback during the intro to 'Let It Go', and the shouted 3-count between the bridge and last chorus of 'Another Hit and Run'.  High'n'Dry is unique in that it was written and recorded before the 80's hard rock/pop-metal formula had been firmly established, and in fact helped define it.  As such, while this album contains all the recognizable elements that came to define the genre, it also covers a lot more ground musically than what was to follow in its footsteps.  Not being a fan of Def Leppard's post-Pyromania releases, I don't know that I can really recommend it to fans of their later work, but to any fans of late-70's/early-80's hard rock who somehow have managed to not yet hear this in the 26 years since its release, do yourself a favor and get this now!  <br /> <br />        <br /> <br />
0743454537|4.0|I became enthralled with this book until the last 20 pages.  I feel like the author took the easy way out in concluding the story.  I had no idea how she would be able to sum up the story in the remainder of the book (the book brings up such large, complex, and important issues...especially related to parenting) and I was let-down in the end. <br /> <br />But, overall, the book got me thinking hard and reevaluating my relationship with my young daughter.  I wondered what I'd do as a parent in different situations raised in the book.  You think you feel one way, and then the author brings up a complication that makes you reexamine your views.   <br /> <br />My husband's co-workers did not like the book because they said it was too depressing to read.  However, I think that instead of being depressing, it is a great study in the enormous complexity of being a parent. <br /> <br />I would give it 5 stars, except for the ending.  Very fast read.
1582701709|2.0|I am in complete agreement with the idea that our thoughts need to be carefully marshaled and focused on what we want.  My comments focus on how Ms. Byrne has expressed that point in this book.<br /><br />Everyone I know swears by the DVD version of The Secret.  I decided to read the book first and then look at the DVD.<br /><br />In grading this book, I am comparing The Secret to the many books that encourage you to create your own reality through mental focus including books written by those quoted in The Secret.<br /><br />First, what is the secret?  As stated in a quotation by Bob Proctor:<br /><br />\\"The Secret is the law of attraction!<br /><br />Everything that is coming into your life you are attracting . . . by virtue of the images you are holding in your mind.\\"<br /><br />Second, what causes the law of attraction to work?  According to Ms. Byrne on page 11:<br /><br />\\"You are the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe.  Your transmission creates your life and it creates the world . . . . And you are transmitting that frequency with your thoughts.\\"<br /><br />Third, what's the evidence that this secret is true?  Each of 24 authors tells anecdotes of people who overcame hurdles after envisioning a more positive result.  A few claims are made that quantum physics supports this conclusion, and Ms. Byrne confides that she understands a great deal about this subject.<br /><br />Fourth, why is this a secret?  Because Ms. Byrne had never heard of the law of attraction prior to a year or so ago.<br /><br />Let me make a few observations about the development of this idea in the book:<br /><br />First, science has shown us that we ignore almost all of the sensory input we receive.  Our minds focus on a small percentage of what's considered relevant through something called the reticular activating system.  Change what you focus on, and you notice things for the first time that have been there all the time.  That's one reason why envisioning what you want works: You notice helpful resources around you that you've been ignoring.  That observation, however, has never been tied to any evidence (to my knowledge) that we physically create anything with our minds beyond our own bodies, except by manipulating the physical world in various ways.<br /><br />Second, religion points to a different phenomenon.  Christians, for example, read in the Bible that God has filled those who have been saved by repenting their sins and believing in Jesus with the Holy Spirit which permits good works (including miraculous works) to be done by the desire of the believer.  The source isn't the believer's mind, but rather God's spiritual resources which are greater than the physical world.  Anyone who read these Biblical texts would say that an individual is far from a powerful source of creating reality:  An individual can do nothing to change reality without God, but can do anything good with God's help to change reality.<br /><br />Third, in Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill reported the results of many years of intensive interviews with the most successful people on Earth of his day.  Many of them believed that their thoughts physically changed the exterior world by opening the door to possibilities that otherwise wouldn't have existed.  But Mr. Hill presented the idea as expressed opinions, rather than as a proven fact.  He also pointed to many other things that these people had done that helped them succeed.  Mr. Hill reported that it takes more just focusing on what you want: There are other steps involved such as working with a mastermind group.<br /><br />Fourth, our own bodies are very strongly affected by our thoughts.  Scientific research keeps showing new dimensions of that fact.  Think certain thoughts and your immune system is stronger.  Think other thoughts and your immune system is weaker.  In addition, placebos do heal people who think they are getting real medicine when they are not.  Why?  Because people are really healing themselves.  You can extend that influence by behaving well or badly towards others, causing a mental reaction in them, which in turn creates a change in their body chemistries.<br /><br />By comparing those earlier works, my sense is that what The Secret really represents is one woman's quick attempt to make sense of this kind of information.  In doing so, she seems to have oversimplified and misstated what is known about the role of thought in creating life experiences.  I doubt if the intent was deliberate or not well intentioned.  But after all, she is a film maker, not a student of thought.<br /><br />By ignoring the full range and roots of the evidence, Ms. Byrne runs the risk of discouraging some people who feel like they are real losers because they cannot evince a perfectly positive reality.  If it were as simple as The Secret suggests, we would have billions of people living trouble-free lives.  To my knowledge, even the most successful practitioners of The Secret aren't as wealthy as those the most successful people who don't.  That would make an interesting study, and a far more valuable book than this one.<br /><br />Here's an example of a misleading example.  Ms. Byrne argues that food doesn't make you fat; it's what you think about food that makes you fat.  The punch line of her story is that \\"I now maintain my perfect weight of 116 pounds and I can eat whatever I want.\\"  Every person I have met who is an authority cited in this book is noticeably overweight.  Why don't any of them want a perfect weight and be able eat anything they want?<br /><br />My point for you:  Avoid this book.<br /><br />I encourage you, however, to think positively and learn about how your thoughts can improve your life!<br /><br />If you want to learn about how to improve your life through your thoughts, consider reading more reliably based and carefully presented sources.  If you prefer a secular book, try Think and Grow Rich or The Success Principles.  If you would like a book that half-way between a religious and secular focus, try Your Best Life Now.  If you want to draw totally on the Christian or Jewish religious roots, read the Bible.<br /><br />I'll look at the DVD now and let you know what I think of that.Why?

B0000009S3|5.0|This is FZ's second solo effort, but in many ways, it's considered his first. \\"Lumpy Gravy\\" was an experimental recording, but it was mostly sound textures, dialogue, and sound effects. He was mainly a classical composer and jazz musician, but this effort is purely jazz-rock fusion, and very powerful-sounding music, at that.<br /><br />This release opens with \\"Peaches En Regalia,\\" a fairly short instrumental, but so full of textures and variations, it's hard to believe it's less than four minutes long. It runs the gamut, with a hard rock edge throughout, but hard rock usually doesn't have percussion, flutes, saxophones, and countless other arrangements thrown in. Like so much of his other work, you can't really classify this. \\"Willie The Pimp\\" is an extended guitar jam, and the whole band is running on all eight cylinders the whole time. The Captain Beefheart vocal is a case of perfect casting. So gritty and raw, a perfect offset to the jazz-influenced rock sound. \\"Son Of Green Genes\\" is the same kind of object as \\"Peaches,\\" layer upon layer of orchestration, but with contemporary instruments, and one hears new arrangements with each listen. \\"Little Umbrellas\\" slows things down a little, stand-up bass, drums played with brushes, flutes and clarinets carrying the melody, sort of a ballroom feel. This is followed with a \\"For Musicians, From Musicians\\" segment, \\"The Gumbo Variations;\\" a very long jam in one key with FZ on guitar, Don Harris on organ and violin, and Ian Underwood on tenor sax. The rhythm section pushes on furiously, while the three lead players cut loose on their respective instruments, and listening to this, it is easy to hear that there was a very high level of energy the night(?) they recorded this. He closes the book with \\"It Must Be A Camel,\\" pure jazz. Although it's note-perfect, it has an icy coldness to it that seems to be put in to wind the proceedings down after the furious jam that precedes it.<br /><br />When I listen to \\"Hot Rats,\\" I know it's a Frank Zappa record, but the man of the hour is actually Ian Underwood. All the instrumentation you hear is rendered by him. Different drummers and bassists throughout supply the necessary rhythm section, and Zappa treats us with very good guitar playing, as well as some interesting percussion, and Beefheart is a force all its own, but all the layers upon layers of arrangements are supplied compliments of Underwood. Zappa got lucky when he found this man, and his body of work is better for it.<br /><br />In all, I would tell you, if you are interested in a crash course in Frank Zappa, \\"Hot Rats\\" is a pretty good starting point.ow it's a Frank Zappa record, but the man of the hour is actually Ian Underwood.

B000LC55F2|4.0|The film version of The Prestige actually pulls something off that's very rare; it ended up being, in many ways, an improvement over the original book. Frankly, the Nolan brothers have taken a lot of liberties with the original story, leaving a lot of key elements from the novel out. Which, considering the often times confusing aspects of the book, can be considered a good thing. To a certain point.<br /><br />The basic storyline remains intact: two rival magicians from the 19th century play an escalating game of one-upsmanship that has very tragic and frightening results. What the Nolan brothers actually improved on, was the heart of the story; the relationship between these two terribly obsessive men. The film fleshes out the lives of these characters, in a way that was lacking in the book by Christopher Preist. Both Bale and Jackman are excellent in their roles, as is Michael Cane. Scarlet Johansen is more less just eye candy for the last half of the film, and she tends to blend in with the scenery.<br /><br />I do have a few complaints however. In the book, there is a fascinating back story involving the children of the two magicians meeting years later, which has been completely left out, and the final scene in the novel is far more unsettling and actually darker then what made it onto the screen. The actual 'surprise' ending of the movie, lacks the punch and truly creepy feel of the last few pages of the book. But having said all that, the film works on so many levels, that i can forgive the changes that were made. At the end of the film, you do indeed want to watch it again, which is always a sign of a great movie.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|To start off, I'm a big Beatles fan, with all of their albums (the import versions) on vinyl and again on CD. I was a fan when they were still together in the 60s.    I received this CD for Christmas, and knowing I was going to see the Las Vegas show in February, I didn't want to spoil the experience of hearing the new music so I only listened to the first two or three songs.    My initial impression was somewhat muted.  The first track \\"Because\\" sounded like an alternative track that could have been included in the Beatles' Anthology CD (much in the way that Eleanor Rigby's strings arrangement was separated from the vocals - only in reverse.)  And after hearing \\"Get Back\\" I dutifully put the CD aside until after seeing the show.    About the Show: If you have any appreciation for the Beatles' music, the show is a must see.  The CD is nearly an exact soundtrack for the show.  So when I heard \\"Because\\" to open the Show, I got goosebumps.  When the show rolled into \\"Get Back\\" complete with a video and image montage of the Rooftop jam session, I was completely sucked into the experience.  One last note about the show...this one is not a typical Cirque show with their amazing acrobatics.  It is more like an interpretation of the music, with a greater emphasis on sound, color, costumes, set design, and dancing.     Back to the CD: After having experienced the show, I was now able to relate what I saw to the tracks on the CD - vividly! Now when I listen to the music the images of the show immediately spring to mind.    In conclusion, I can see how others might be disappointed in this supposed \\"mash up\\" of Beatle tunes - the context for the blending of the music simply cannot be provided listening to the music alone.  But after having seen the show, I have a deeper appreciation for the artistry and vision of the Martins, the Beatles (and wives), and the Cirque team.
B000MM0L2S|5.0|Being a very long time 'Tallica fan, I would lie if I said their track wasn't the main reason I've got the album in the first place. However, as any other music lover, I did look forward at other music that could have  been interesting. And it does appear on this tribute. Yo-Yo Ma's track was enjoyable, Fleming's track too, so were 3 new tracks Ennio threw in for the additional pleasure. <br />All in all, the album is interesting because it has a good vibe of appreciation of the maestro. Therefore, I would recommend it to anybody, who knows Ennio's work and to others beyond. <br /> <br />As of Metallica track. It is nothing of a surprise, because the original song is very well known, and the cover is the true Metallica cover. It sounds very fresh, with little nice guitar solo tweaks, it feels like the guys are in their 20's again, it is done with the same 'not-too-serious' attitude as Garage days where done back in 87. It made me feel good, and that's what matters. <br /> <br />It'd be logical if they will play the concert intro themselves for these few Europe shows they have this summer, and I hope to see that happen, since I got the Vienna gig tickets already through the Metclub, hope to get Moscow ones too. <br /> <br />Take care and enjoy. <br />
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|Their is so many things I love about this movie. #1- Martin Scorsese (The Goodfellas, and Casino) directed this film. #2- The ACTING WAS AWESOME, this was Leonardo DiCaprio's best acting performance since Titanic, Jack Nicholson was f***ing CrAzY and really does deserve any Oscar for this part, Mark Walberg and Alec Baldwin were hilarious, and Matt Damon was the mac-daddy and played his part perfect. #3-  I'm surprised that know body has mentioned this yet, Brad Pitt was one of the producers of the film. To bad Brad Pitt didn't star in this film, when I saw his name on the credits I was wondering why he didn't star in the movie he helped produce? #4- You have to see this in HD it is sweet! I saw it in the theater the day it came out and if I had a chance to see it again on the big screen I wouldn't, HD-DVD has changed my life and my mind on watching movies. I think I would rather save my 10 dollars and put it towards the HD release ! Anyways a must buy for the HD-DVD or Blu-ray Collection! (I don't own a blu-ray player yet, but I saw The Departed on blu-ray at my friends house and  both formats look the same 2 me!)
B00005U8EM|5.0|So many people have commented on the humor, philosophy, cinematography, acting, and other aspects of Groundhog Day.  To avoid belaboring it, I will simply say that this movie is excellent in all of those ways! <br /> <br />I just want to speak about some funny things that aren't usually mentioned first when speaking about this movie.  There were humorous moments - both blatant and subtle - throughout the movie that just add to its masterpiece quality.  For example, the whole scene where Murray is dressed like \\"Bronco,\\" and he's just purchased an EXTREMELY expensive car in which to take his date (dressed like a French maid) to a movie that he's seen \\"a hundred times\\" just splits my sides open every time I see it!  The Spaghetti Western music, and the expressions on Murray's face in this scene are just over-the-top funny!  And don't forget Murray's line at seeing Nancy, a previous one-night stand to whom he proposed marriage: \\"My old fiance.  She doesn't remember me.\\"  Hilarious. <br /> <br />Murray's dialogue during several \\"tapings\\" of the Groundhog festival are worth mentioning.  Examples include (forgive me if the quotes aren't word perfect):  the crowd \\"waiting to worship a rat!\\";  \\"You're hypocrites!  You used to take the hog out and you used to eat it!\\";  \\"A large squirrel predicting the weather\\";  and of course \\"Your winter is gonna be cold, and it's gonna last you for the rest..of..your.. life.\\"   <br /> <br />And finally, the segment with Murray and the two guys from the bowling alley going on the rampage in a car, being chased by police, is worth the price of admission by itself.  I think the \\"flapjacks\\" guy is a candidate for the funniest minor character in ANY comedy! <br /> <br />And, to quote the flapjack guy, \\"That about sums it up for me.\\"
6304936362|3.0|I wish I could give this movie a better rating but I saw it on cable a little while ago and it set me thinking. My problem is that the movie is a bit too prosaic and formulaic. It suffers from a weak script. Most of the crew are the clean-cut, all American boys from the movies of the war era and, as such, they lack definition, individuality and some credibility. The song by Harry Connick seems like a gratuitous addition. Having said that, it was good to see some of the old warbirds in the air and the movie gains life when the mission actually begins.  I took my Dad to see the movie when it was in the theaters. He was an waist gunner on a B-17 in 1943 and I was interested in his reaction. He said he'd seen most of the instances portrayed except the mid-air collision. He also managed to tell me a few more things over the years before he passed: like the time a plane blew up on the ground while being loaded for a mission or the time their tail gunner bailed out after the plane was hit and the communications link was shattered. He also saw men fall to their knees in tears out of fear of the upcoming mission. Anyone who has stood in a B-17 and seen the thin sheet aluminum and bracing that was their protection will realize how naked these men must have felt. They deserve a grittier and more nuanced homage than this film gives them.   It's not that it's a bad film; it's better than the juvenalia of the more recent Pearl Harbor but lacks the strength that made the series Band of Brothers so exceptional.
B0006J28L4|4.0|Spike Lee is a great film maker. Denzel Washington is a great actor (Could any other actor have given the spirit of Malcolm such a realistic treatment?). That said, something is missing here. We know that there are various academic revisionist trends in history and politics that reflect the changing appreciations of latter generations, and not always for the better. That trend is apparent here. The missing element is the struggle going on around Malcolm as he tries honestly to break out of the black nationalist isolation of the Nation of Islam and articulate the necessary strategy to drive the civil rights movement in America and the revolutionary national liberation struggles internationally forward. What is also missing is the sense that Malcolm, in the early 1960's, stood as the LONE voice of the rage of the ghettos, against the white establishment and their black hangers-on like Dr. King. There was a Chinese Wall between his calls to break with the Kennedys, Johnsons and the rest of the Democratic Party, his calls for black armed self-defense, North,South and West and the policies of what he rightly called the \\"Uncle Tom\\" black establishment which kowtowed to that white establishment. There still is. No amount of revisionism will erase that distinction. What those interested in Malcolm need to do is read his Autobiography of Malcolm X  (see all my reviews for my take on Malcolm) and other books from the 1960's struggles. Still, this film is a good primer in order to learn how the most honest revolutionary black liberation fighter in 20th century America earned his place in history.
0812975219|4.0|We are emotional beings, capable of understanding our emotions but not very good at controlling them; hence we are blind to probability. <br /> <br />We also like nice neat explanations for events (I succeed because I am brilliant, I fail because of bad luck) and are susceptible to superstition. No where are these human traits more visible than in the financial community. <br /> <br />Taleb writes from experience and weaves an entertaining, insightful piece. His intelligence is evident in his writing, which may be why my `middlebrow' (a favorite adjective of his) mind had trouble adjusting to his style. <br /> <br />He has a quick wit and is not afraid to use it (Wait, he was kidding there, right?) More importantly, his observations are spot on. A healthy dose of selfdeprecation let's the reader know that this guy has first hand experience being fooled by randomness. <br /> <br />This is a really useful read for anyone starting a career (not just in Finance), or enjoying great success in one. <br /> <br />An awareness of survivorship bias, denigration of history and our innate blindness to probability (fueled by emotion and a need to draw causality in what we observe) will serve recent college grads well in the industry of their choice. <br /> <br />For the recently successful, Taleb warns that the five common characteristics shared by fools of randomness are <br /> <br />    1.Overestimating the accuracy of some metric they believe in <br />    2.Being married to a position <br />    3.Failure to plan on what to do when the unthinkable happens <br />    4.Lack of Critical Thinking <br />    5.Denial in the face of the unthinkable <br /> <br />You will nod and understand the concepts as he presents them. However, the author cynically points out, you will proceed to forget it all and go back to being governed by your emotions.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I've been listening to this record for... well... decades. It isn't groundbreaking and it neither inspires nor requires much discussion, but it wears very well. In contrast with Pink Floyd material from that era, Gilmour has no lyrical axe to grind. I've never been sure the songs were about anything at all. But this is elegantly composed, beautifully sung and played music of high, consistent quality; an impeccably tasteful, all-around classy set of rather laid-back rock tunes that haven't really aged.
B00005JO20|1.0|Unless you've been living under a rock for some 70 years, you know the plot of King Kong, the scoop on the remake, and are probably acquainted with several reviews of it.  So let's cut to the chase.  Why doesn't this film work?  OK -  <br /> <br />1.  Ann Darrow is pummeled and flung around by Kong and assorted prehistoric beasts for what seems like hours, any 5 seconds of which would have popped her head off like a toy, yet emerges unscathed.  She also runs for hours barefoot through a wild jungle without suffering the slightest scratch to her feet <br />2.  Use of slow shutter speed when being terrorized by the natives for \\"dramatic effect\\" might work in an episode of \\"Unsolved Mysteries,\\" but we could expect more from a multi-gajillion dollar Hollywood blockbuster. <br />3.  Adrian Brody grabs Ann and flies a pterodactyl from a mountain ledge down to the jungle floor.  `Nuff said. <br />4.  Jack Black demonstrates the acting range that has made him a leading contender for the role of \\"Nacho Libre 2.\\" <br />5.  Streets of New York, including Police cars, screaming pedestrians and assorted carnage and destruction, are nonsensically calmed and cleared during Kong's rampage through New York City to make way for a slo-motion Armani evening gown catwalk sequence. <br />6.  The producers of King Kong were apparently forced to sign the \\"every actor in every action movie must run across a series of bridges or groundwork which collapse into the abyss 0.003 seconds after they step off\\" clause. <br />7.  Brontosaurus stampede is ridiculous, CGI is unconvincing, and every actor in the movie should have been crushed dead within 12 seconds but isn't.  Sequence also seems to last for 45+ minutes <br />8.  After finally capturing Kong, the now-damaged and too small vessel is tasked with carrying him.  Then we inexplicably cut to New York City where Kong has safely arrived.  ?????? <br />9.  Standing atop the Empire State Building in high heels poses no threat of falling due to winds, vertigo, or exhaustion <br />10.  Nights in New York last from 10 PM to 11:45 PM, at which point the sun rises again.  I had no idea New York City occupied the same latitude as Nome, Alaska <br />11.  Does Kong get relentlessly attacked every night by hordes of pterodactyls?  If so, why?  And if not, why now? <br />12.  Are we supposed to believe that with much of the crew missing and maybe being killed, with the ship barely seaworthy and in desperate need of attention, the other crewmates have nothing better to do than discuss classic literature? <br />13.  For that matter, why are many of these shipmates introduced, fleshed out, and never mentioned again?  <br />14.  How come no one in a staff of thousands working on the movie noticed any of the above? <br />
B0000793ZA|5.0|Outstanding tunes . . . Speed Your Love to Me.... Memories of a time past and present....
0671798154|5.0|check out Thayer's 'The Stettin Secret'. I thought it was every bit as good as 'Midnight' and nearly as good as spy classics like the Key to Rebecca and The Eagle Has Landed. Thayer needs to write more WW2-era thrillers, I love his characters and the excellent attention to detail.
B00006WKY9|5.0|This is a great scorpions album.  It ranks up there with Fly to the Rainbow and In Trance (my two favorite scorp albums.)  I think it's better than Virgin Killer but I know others may disagree.  Definitely a must if you like old scorps.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|The sixth, and last part of the Rocky-Series is a great movie. 'Rocky Balboa' is the comeback of the year, earning more than $70 Million at the US Box Office. As much as no one expected it being such a success, nobody expected this film to be as fantastic as it became. <br />RB is a movie about love. It also reminds us of what is important in life, not to give up and believe in yourself. <br />Sylvester Stallone, once again actor, writer and director in one person, does an outstanding job. He recreates the atmosphere of the first Rocky movie (that won 3 Oscars) and gives the series a perfect ending.
B000MS1XXI|3.0|Looks real cool! Great ambient settings. Love the powerboat to Cuba! But the story is lacking.  Gotta like the music and the images though. Worth watching if you got nothing better to do on a rainy night.
0452287588|5.0|As a reader who very much felt a spiritual resonance with Power of Now I had wondered if A New Earth would be redundant. I was pleased to find it to be an excellent futher clarification of the concepts of ego and its many faces including the concept of 'negative ego'. Throughout reading Power of Now I kept wondering \\"Is he talking about ego?\\" since the term 'ego' was rarely if ever used. A New Earth very much focuses on the concept of ego and speaks in a simple yet powerful way that furthers spiritual awakening and enlightenment.
B0002S947K|5.0|I am one of those people who is infinately picky about music. So many artists out there today have one or two really good songs and the rest of the CD is just fluff. Ray LaMontagne is not one of them. Every single song on this album is consistantly excellent. His voice has a brushy, raspy quality to it that somehow manages to fill you with yearning, even if you have nothing to pine for. Bluesy and soulful, I can't believe Ray hasn't blown off the billboard charts yet. I share his music with everyone and hope that he is awarded the recognition he deserves.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Better quality than the first dvd released, however, it still doesn't leave the impression that it's the best remastering job that could have been done.  It looks good, but...  not \\"platinum\\" perfect.  It is much, much better than the previous dvd release, though.  The colors are brighter and the images are much sharper.  The sound is much better, too.    And, the movie is great.
0743298020|4.0|Setterfield's novel The Thirteenth Tale is a captivating debut -- brimming with complex twists, secrets, confused identities, squeaky staircases and gothic-like intrigue -- conjuring up loose comparisons to Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White and Br&ouml;nte's Jane Eyre.<br /><br />At the heart of the story is Margaret Lea, a plain bookish girl who works in her father's antiquarian bookstore in London. Constantly surrounded and preoccupied with books, she has also written a minority of amateur biographies of relatively unknown historical figures.<br /><br />The intrigue commences when a mysterious letter arrives for Margaret, from Vida Winters - an eccentric famous author who insists on confounding her aficionados and biographers with fictional adaptations of her life story with an oath of their authenticity. Aside from countless best sellers, Winters has also written a book entitled \\"The Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation\\" which, curiously enough, only contains 12 stories. The letter summons Margaret to Winter's home where she is asked by the terminally ill author to embark on a biography of her life at the tragic Anglefield Estate. It is a story of twins, shadows, scandal, and deception.<br /><br />As work on the biography begins, both Winters and Margaret struggle to deal with the truth of their painful pasts. Not before the dreadful realities are skillfully revealed by the author, the secret behind the strangely absent \\"thirteenth tale\\" is finally uncovered.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale succeeds in being equally heart-pounding and heart-wrenching, and most definitely worth a read. One can only look forward to Diane Setterfield's next novel.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|Jimi Hendrix is one of my top 10 musicians of all time. HE CAN PLAY THAT GUITAR!! I like several of his songs like 'Purple Haize', 'All Along The Wotchtawer', 'Voodoo Chile', 'Hey Joe', 'The Wind Cries Mary', and Foxey Lady. TOO BAD HE'S DEAD. CLASSIC ROCK NEVER DIES!! GET THIS IS YOUR COLLECTION.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is bound to be one of the most devisive films this year. Its a really made film with excellent performances from the actors involved in it and a complex storyline that didn't feel too melodramatic to hamper its impact. Its also so convoluted that its point will be lost to a lot of people who get bored and give up.  In Morocco a couple with they're marriage in trouble are vacationing when the wife is hit by a stray bullet while riding a tour bus. The shooters are two children gaurding their fathers herd of goat who while bored shoot the rifle their father bartered for from another man. In America the couples nurse maid takes their two children to Mexico in order to attend her son's wedding and end up finding it harder to get back into America carrying someone else's children. And finally in Japan the deaf daughter of the man who owned the gun goes in search of some kind of connection, outcast in her country due to her inability to communicate with others.  Thats a basic plot description. With movies like this unless the writer director spells it out deciphering what the plot can be complicated and usually would be interepreted several different ways so in honor of fairness I'll leave that to those who watch the film. I will admit there are several times in this film that my attention was riveted by great filmmaking. Inarittu is an excellent director who gives even the smaller moments of the film power. He's helped by four excellent performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adrianna Barza and Rinko Kikuchi who adds the most ammount of weight as the deaf girl. She's the powerhouse of the film who definitely deserves the acclaim and accolades she's reaping.  In the end the films pace will turn a lot people off. There was one scene with the Moroccan children that I personally could have done without. But the film is worth seeing. You might not like it but its better to try an art film than to waste time with a mindless entertainment.
B0000073NC|5.0|This is an awesome album.  The songs are very trippy in some spots and very definitely in the 70's psychedelic rock.  Great guitar work. <br />The only negative is that the album is short.
1932907009|5.0|Incredible screenwriting book that is full of insights and practicality from someone who has sold multiple screenplays. The structure and board development chapters are the highlight of a book that belongs on the shelf next to Mckee, Field, and Seger.
0800141806|5.0|Philadelphia is the best acting Tom Hanks has ever done. The movie shows how a struggle with AIDS cannot only kill but change someone's perspective.
1582701709|1.0|From what I can see from reading the first half of this book, this is just the Kaballah (yes, practiced by Madonna) repackaged in non-sectarian, new age format.  The basic idea is that if you wish for something and keep wishing really really hard, it will finally happen for you.  Your wishing and your determination will manipulate the universe (God) into giving you what you want.  Since a good many people don't want to do the hard work to accomplish their dreams, this kind of nonsense is appealing to a huge population.  The author claims that a good many famous and successful people knew and practiced this secret.  I can't verify this, since those cited are dead and the dead cannot defend themselves.  However, I do want to note that I am a physicist and modern physics, including quantum mechanics, does not support and has nothing in common with the author's ideas.
0345457692|4.0|\\"Altered Carbon: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel,\\" the first novel by Richard K. Morgan, makes a great read for those in an escapist mood on a long winter's weekend. I won't bother recounting the premise except to say that Morgan has created a fictional concept of immortality and consciousness that allows him great latitude to play around with.<br /><br />Following the ever weaving plot takes some doing at times, but by the time you finish, half a dozen or more images will be seared into your mind, which may or may not be a good thing. His overarching theme----what is it to be human?----remains front and center throughout.<br /><br />Morgan's writing has a crisp, no-nonsense leanness which is refreshing in a genre that often yields to ponderous overwriting that causes stories to collapse under their own weight. As a whole, his melding of elements from hard-boiled detective stories and sci-fi works better than one might expect.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We have found this performance and its recording to be one of the most exceptional ever.
B000002GWN|4.0|I agree with the reviewers who find Tom Scott and the L.A. Express to be a detriment to Joni's sound -- compare this band to the superlative band she toured with on Shadows and Light (Metheny, Pastorius) and the deficiencies are obvious.  But then I've had a grudge against Scott ever since he mucked up George Harrison's Extra Texture (Read All About It).<br /><br />Turn out the lights and put on the second half -- Joni lights up the acoustic, sparsely-accompanied set with her incredible voice and spirit. I love her delicate, committed versions of \\"Circle Game\\" and \\"Both Sides Now,\\" the beautiful \\"Real Good for Free,\\" the aching version of \\"People's Party.\\"<br /><br />It's worth picking this up for the acoustic set.  Also, the inside photos of Joni are precious -- we love you, thank you for your art.

1582701709|1.0|When I first heard about this book, I was very intrigued by it. Their claims that \\"The Secret\\" had been around for thousands of years, known by some of the greatest people in our history, and that many people had died for it it was very intoxicating. Like everyone else, their marketing campaign worked, and I found myself really wanting to know what this \\"Secret\\" was so that I too could become President or invent something grand. As it turns out, the real \\"Secret\\" is being an incredible marketing campaign, which is what it took to convince so many people, Oprah included, that this was worth paying for.<br /><br />This \\"book\\" is filled with ridiculous claims that all center around the more absurd claim of the actual \\"Secret,\\" which is basically that man controls the Universe and if he only wishes for positive things, they will come. Ie, if you have positive thoughts about winning the lottery and expunge negativity from your life, the Universe will pick up on this and start to put things into motion to let you accomplish this goal. \\"The Secret is nothing more than a repackaged attempt to promote an old concept: \\"The Law of Attraction.\\" The Law of Attraction encourages you to not dwell on the negative and only focus on the positive, as your thoughts determine your destiny. It believes that your thoughts \\"penetrate space and time\\" and grab onto other positively charged thoughts put out by other individuals to make positive things happen. Now, I can understand how positive thinking can help. Confidence goes a long way, and if you are positive about getting a new job, your confidence will show through, your prospective employer will pick up on that, and it will help. But the idea that the Universe, which is so unbelievably vast compared to humans that we cannot even compare the two, works for US is absurd. The authors offer no scientific evidence at all to support their claims, and they offer no real evidence that people like the freemasons and past US presidents practiced this theory. What's more, this book seems like its main goal is moreso to point you to their web site if you want the full benefits of \\"The Secret,\\" where you find you have to pay an extra $40 to learn \\"the real truth.\\"<br /><br />If you want to believe in \\"The Secret\\" or the \\"Law of Attraction\\" as it's actually called, you can find everything you want to know on the Internet and learn all in about 15 minutes. If that's not enough, read \\"The Law of Attractio\\" by Esther Hicks, which is much better written and is more of a value than the scan 216 pages you are getting with Byrne's edition (Byrne even takes most of her ideas from Hicks and acknowledges this in the book).ed this theory.
