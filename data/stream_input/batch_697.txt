B000QEIORG|5.0|I won't deny that the primary attraction of this rerelease is the amount of nostalgia I felt for the first release--it was released during a bad time in my life, and, in addition to being the first rock album I ever purchased myself, remains one of the only happy memories of the year 1997 for me.    That being said, there is a short piece in the CD's accompanying booklet by band member Nate Mendel, in which he writes, \\"This is I think the album we'll always be judged against. But, why?\\"    His answer is that the album is the most \\"lived in.\\" I agree with that sentiment, and I'll elaborate my theories. Of all the Foo Fighter's works, TCATS has the most depth and range--it tackles issues like loss, relationship struggles, and feeling oppressed--in short, all the topics any angsty teen (as I most certainly was) has no trouble identifying with. Yet, at the same time, the album runs the gamut of emotions. There's the quiet angst of the opening track, 'Doll,' the dramatic reverence contained in 'My Hero,' the whimsical lightheartedness of 'See You,' and the full-out edge of rock tracks like 'Enough Space,' and 'Hey, Johnny Park!' It's as much a roller coaster ride as an album, and while no single song can stand on its own as well as later Foo works such as 'All My Life' or 'Learn to Fly,' every track is an integral part of the whole experience.    The addition of the six bonus tracks on this rerelease only adds to the experience--the four covers are all b-sides from the original album's singles, and the two additional tracks are planned tracks for the album that were left on the mixing room floor, so to speak. The title track, in particular is of note--it's the closest you'll hear Foo Fighters to sounding like Grohl's previous band, Nirvana, with all its fuzz, distortion, and beautiful disharmony.    All in all, it's a highly recommended purchase, whether you own the original or not--in addition to bonus tracks, the entire original album is remastered, and it sounds crisper and more energetic than ever.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Wong's lush romantic melodrama is an achingly gorgeous homage to unrequited love. Though Chow and Chan are drawn to each other, personal morals and social propriety prevent them from acting on their attraction--a tension Wong exploits masterfully, evoking their desire with hushed phone conversations, furtive looks, and a heavily eroticized scenario in which they pretend to be the cheating lovers, play-acting an adultery they won't indulge. Beautifully shot by Chris Doyle, every frame of this film hums and throbs with eroticism. An art piece as much as a story of longing, \\"Love\\" is smart, sexy, and atmospheric.
1594489505|3.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is garnering a lot of attention because of the success of the author's first novel.  Most reviewers are giving the novel high praise, and it is a pretty good novel, but the bottom line is, it isn't that good.  If it weren't for The Kite Runner, few people would be paying much attention to A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />Hosseini is a talented writer but his sophomore effort, while ambitious, comes up a little short.  I think what made the Kite Runner so compelling was that it centered around a life-altering moment.  This defining moment in the character's life anchors the novel and gives it a sense of purpose. The first part of the novel builds up to it, and the balance of the novel deals with the fallout of it and the characters quest to be good again.<br /><br />`Suns' on the other hand lacks this sense of purpose.  We are introduced to two women whose lives keep getting worse.  They are powerless to improve their miserable existence and while they suffer hardship, they have no significant internal conflict to overcome.  It becomes something of an endurance test to suffer with these women who have so little joy in their lives.<br /><br />I realize that this is the way life was (and still is to a degree today) but because these characters (for most of the novel) are trapped by circumstance, and have so little control over their own lives, there is little internal conflict to engage the reader. The novel becomes largely predictable.<br /><br />For me, the greatest strength of the novel is the insight it provides into the culture and history of a country we still know so little about.  In North America, Afghanistan was news-worthy when communists came into power and the Soviets rolled across the border, but once the Soviet tanks pulled out, we lost interest in the Country for more than a decade, ignoring violence and oppression, until 9/11 put Afghanistan back on the evening news.<br /><br />This book will clearly be a big hit and while it's pretty good, it just isn't great.  I would recommend you read The Kite Runner instead, but it's safe to assume that everyone reading this review already has.  While comparisons to Kite Runner are inevitable (I've done it myself) `Suns' reminds me more of Golden's `Memoirs of a Geisha' than it does The Kite Runner.  `Geisha' is much better than both of Hosseini's novels.eat.

B0002DB52M|5.0|Filmed on a minimal soundstage with chalk lines and partial building facades, Von Trier's disturbing, provocative allegory of hypocrisy at the heart of the American soul is undeniably long at just under three hours, but still fascinating to watch. As the aptly named Grace, Kidman is sweet and above reproach, so we feel her pain at the hands of Dogville's putatively upstanding citizens, who reveal themselves to be closet sadists. Von Trier's direction is razor sharp, aided by a fantastic ensemble cast including Phillip Baker Hall, Chloe Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgaard, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, and the wonderful John Hurt, whose impeccable voiceover edges this dark parable into the realm of classic fairy tale.
0739340670|4.0|Another top quality thriller from a true story-teller,  narrated by a gifted artist in his field. I felt part of the action from beginning to end, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fast-paced quality fiction.

Everyone shared their results and it seemed to really promote understanding. Its a great book and a great management tool.
B00005JPLW|5.0|i thought that the movie 300 was the best movie ever made about ancient mythology and folk lore.  this movie puts troy and alexander to shame.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|What a movie!      This one transcends most over-the-top potboilers of its -- or any -- era.  In some circles, it's a near-classic film.  What we have is the story of Howard Roark, a man of principle who cannot get work as an architect because he will not compromise his skills by conforming to meet only what has been done before.  He will not allow his work to become a committee project.      Patricia Neal is Dominique Francon, a spoiled woman who is determined she will never love anyone because no one will ever be worthy of her love, a love that only a man of principle could aspire to.  Since, in her experience, there are no such men, she is determined to be cold-hearted and removed.    One day, though, she sees Howard Roark in a granite quarry.  Her attraction to him, it seems, is purely animal magnetism.  She storms and stews.  She frantically paces in her bedroom.  She seethes with unbridled angst and determination. In an act of lustful desperation, she smashes a beautiful marble hearth in order to get Roark into her bedroom in order to make a connection with him.    He measures the hearth and orders the marble.  When the marble arrives, he sends a mason to install it.  Dominique takes this as an act of indifference on Roark's part, and it infuriates her. She chases him down and whacks him across the face with a riding crop.    The rest must be seen to be believed.    Raymond Massey is very good as the editor of The Banner, the newspaper that tries to destroy everything that is good and noble, etc.,etc.,etc.     It has one of the most glorious Max Steiner scores EVER.    This is one of those movies that goes on and on, and, yet, there is NEVER A DULL MOMENT.    I don't recall the novel of \\"The Fountainhead\\" being this brassy and -- for lack of a more-appropriate word -- trashy.      Thus, I can highly recommend \\"The Fountainhead\\" as both a novel and as a movie, both of which exist independent of the other...with the movie getting the 'you'd never imagine this ina million years' award for its adaptation, especially given that it's Ayn Rand, herself, who scripted the film.    This is one hell of a movie that everyone ought to see!

B000OPOANE|4.0|Well, it's been several months since Snake & Arrows came out, and I've had plenty of time to give it it's fair consideration. Rush has never been a band whose music was immediately accessible to most people, they put a lot into their music and it takes a lot to get the \\"Big Picture\\" from it. There hasn't been a Rush album since Test For Echo or Moving Pictures that immediately grabbed me and struck me as being absolutely awesome and rockin.<br /><br />With that said, after much time and listening, I'm finding Snakes & Arrows to be one of the most beautiful and meaningful albums Rush has released in a very long time (well, it's been quite a long time since their last album too :)<br /><br />There's a lot in this album that seems to describe the exact circumstances I've been finding myself in, in the last few years (sadly.) But as usual, I also found a good bit of inspiration to keep going through life, despite it's unfairness, meanness, misfortunes..<br /><br />How unfortunate I was not able to see them in concert this time around. The thought that Rush won't be around much longer is very sad to me, but inescapable considering their age. But, I do hope they will be around for many decades to come, producing new music for us to reflect on and enjoy :)
B000089J0R|5.0|Excellent album.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was the way the vocals were recorded.  They seemed a little muddy.  Boosting the mids on my stereo helped a little bit, but they still felt drowned out.  Overall a great album (that's not as quite as cheesy as Inhuman Rampage) by a great band!
B0002V7O3I|5.0|One kid has a dream of a giant circuit board.  There is a blue glowing ball that is air tight that a genuis kid can control.  They want to go to outerspace; so, they attempt to.    Some of the music in this movie is fantastic.    This is a movie better-suited for younger kids... Like 14 and under... maybe somewhere around there.  The ending is quicker than you're going to want it to be.  Great movie for kids.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|Clearly a great looking watch. A tremendous value from Invicta, The Grand Diver makes a very bold statement with its absolutely huge  face. The Blueface and sweeping automatic second hand looks great. At night the glow is probably the brightest I have ever seen. You can see this watch from across the room in the dark.  The watch feels the same quality and weight of Rolex, Omega, Movado with a thick casing that sits boldly on your wrist.     The first thing a person will do when meeting another person for the first time is look at their watch and their shoes. If a guy has on a very nice suit, but then has a ho-hum watch it just kind of blows the first impression.  I know it sounds shallow but that's life and you only get one chance to make a first impression. The Invicta makes a great first impression.    I get many compliments on the watch's size(makes others look small) and great looks. Some of my co-workers who have spent more money on the Omega Seamaster have looked at my watch and liked it better.  With the Invicta you can wear it anywhere and it will last forever and hold up to the toughest abuse.    All in all, if your looking for a great looking, WOW Factor Watch, but have more important things to spend your money on, (Lets face it, they all do the same thing-and that's tell time)The Invicta Grand Diver is a no brainer!    Don't take my word for it go to Invicta's website and see how they build their watches. Invicta truly is a quality watch company with styles from classic understated elegance to cutting edge design and technology.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I was very excited for this album after hearing Tarantula.  However, I was not immediately overwhelmed with Zeitgeist the first couple of times  I listened to it in my car.  I was hoping that they would use a wide range of instruments as they had done on past albums.  One thing was clear from the first listen...this is one of the hardest albums Smashing Pumpkins has produced.  It is a true guitar album!  Also one of the first things that caught my attention was the vocal layering, which is probably the best of any Smashing Pumpkins album.    But, then I put Zeitgeist on my MP3 player, adding it to my Smashing Pumpkins/Zwan/Billy mix.  Mixing Zeitgeist songs with other SP songs helped me realize that Zeitgeist is right up there with anything Smashing Pumpkins has created.  In fact, this is classic Smashing Pumpkins.  They have really delivered on providing a great start to their reunion.  The only reason why I didn't give this album 5 stars is because I would have enjoyed a wider use of instruments.    I definitely recommend it...and make sure and buy (no bit torrents on this album) a copy to send a message that we want Smashing Pumpkins to keep making music.
B000002U82|4.0|This black pearl of Rogerian profundity represents the pessimist's inversion of, \\"today is the first day of the rest of your life.\\" Between both extremes lies the truth, which is that each day brings us closer to judgement, heaven or hell, the choice of which is ours, based upon the way that we tick away \\"the moments that make up the dull day.\\" It takes courage to face the fact that our actions are meaningful and have eternal consequences, no matter how mundane they may be. \\"Life sucks and then you die\\" is a great excuse for those who are too lazy to clean the toilet, like your mother asked you to. Instead, you can flop down on the couch, get stoned, veg out to some Floyd, and tell yourself that you're so much better than \\"them,\\" be they soldiers (\\"Us and Them\\"), or greedy businessmen (\\"Money\\"), or your mother, who still wants you to clean the toilet. So get over your self-righteous, self-pity, and do something for someone else for a change. A bath every once in a while wouldn't hurt either...      Of all the memorable lines in this great album, why do I seize on this one? Because it best represents the philosophy that lies beneath this album, which is, at best, pessimism, and at worst, despair and fatalism. This is dangerous stuff, especially for young people, who are prone to narcissism.    Although importantly flawed, DSOTM is a great album. \\"Money\\" and \\"Us and Them\\" are conceptual and musical masterpieces. \\"Money\\" is especially notable for the best use of sound effects in rock history, and the poignant \\"Us and Them\\" soars musically. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" is a daring innovation (singing, without words) that wholly succeeds as a mystical, pagan contemplation of death. \\"Time\\" is another musical gem that, despite the objections given above, warns us all about wasting our talents, in what is perhaps my favorite line of the album, \\"Then one day you turn to find/ ten years have got behind you/ no one told you when to run/ you missed the starting gun.\\" \\"On the Run\\"is sonically ground-breaking and a pleasure to listen to.    Unfortunately, the sophomoric \\"Brain Damage\\" mars the album with its spoken-word and cackling pretension. This is excusable due to former bandmate Syd Barrett's descent into madness, but \\"Brain Damage\\" sounds like something out of a bad science fiction movie, not as a mature consideration of mental illness.     Overall, DSOTM represents a historic and musical milestone, and is a must for every rock music collection, the above objections notwithstanding.
0385337388|4.0|A fascinating look inside a doctor's year as an intern.  This semi-autobiographical tale does come off as a bit dated at times, but it's influence can be felt whenever you watch an episode of St. Elsewhere, Scrubs, or even Grey's Anatomy.  An interesting read that I highly recomend to anyone doing any kind of internship.
B000007OTH|5.0|I can't add much to the eloquent comments already posted, but Bruch's symphonies are sweet, relaxing, and surprisingly approachable.  I would only wish he had written more.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is a great film that is not to be missed, but might not be easy for some to watch. There are some truly heart wrenching scenes in this surreal nightmarish account of John Merrick's(The Elephant Man)life. Interesting fact is that Anthony Hopkins was given the role of Hannibal Lector(Silence Of The Lambs)after the director saw his portrayal of the good sympathetic doctor in this film. I have seen this film many times, but it requires time in between viewings for recovery. I remember back in the 80's one of the cable channels played this all the time and it got to a point where I couldn't stand to look at it. It was kind of like in \\"Clock Work Orange\\" when they forced him to watch all that violence with his eye lids forced open!
0201633612|5.0|I don't have much formal programming training... much of what I've learned has been through self study.  As a consequence, many times I'm not sure if I know something or not.  Usually, I try to convince myself I know something but a tiny bit of doubt remains in the back of my head.  This is the case for me with respect to object oriented programming.  I thought I understood what object oriented programming was about, but I would only use it for certain parts of my programs (using perl, where things are not necessarily object oriented).  Also, I would have trouble understanding large OO'd software packages.  Reading this book really caused things to click in my mind and I realized what exactly object oriented was all about, how to use object orientation, how not to use it, etc.      Some of those who gave this book low ratings might reasons from their situation, but for me this book helped a lot.  I'll agree that the concepts are abstract and difficult, but the authors set up different paths thru the book depending on the readers goals.  I think a beginning programmer would get blown away by this book, while experts might know it all from good teachers or painful experience.  For me however, this book gave me a bunch of \\"aha!\\" moments as the authors explain situations that make programming tricky and explain the solutions.      Also, the book is nice and solid w/ two bookmark ribbons (at least for the hardcover version).  Very high quality and not so expensive compared to college textbooks.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This movie gets better with each viewing. When I watch this film, I feel as if I am looking through a keyhole(at one time this was possible)and spying something I am not supposed to see.<br /><br />This is one disturbing, weird and surreal film! I can only imagine that Lynch stayed up too late one night and ate a variety of spicy snacks only to fall asleep and dream this open ended nightmare. I just don't know how he could have come up with this creepy and disturbing story otherwise. A fascinating one of a kind experience, but it sure won't be for everyone's taste!
0399103422|5.0|No spoilers.    At this point, everyone and their mother knows what The Godfather is about. Unfortunately, too many people have seen the movie and have skipped over the book. Big mistake. Yes, the movie is great and one of the best of all time blah blah, but the book, just like every other book that is turned into a movie, offers the detail and character development unlike anything you experience in the movie. If the movie were six hours perhaps, then maybe it would be able to match the book, but then who would sit through that?    Without rehashing the plot, the best thing way to describe the book is what was said by the official Amazon review. In it, the writer says: \\"... despite leading unconventional lifestyles within a notorious crime family, [the characters] experience the triumphs and failures of the human condition.\\" That is the perfect way to sum up the goings on of this book because regardless of crime that goes hand-in-hand with the Cosa Nostra lifestyle, it's easy, as a reader, to look past that and see each and every one of these characters as a regular person--a person who experiences all the ups and downs of life. The characterization and personal way in which Puzo created the players in the novel (especialy the Don,) forces you to cozy up to them and care where their respective roller coaster lifestyles will take them.    In summation, if you like the movie then you'll love the book because it's everything in the moive times two. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an evening or two with the Don.
B0000035E7|5.0|I don't have much to say, because everyone has his own opinion, but if you like a great and a really sound, you have to buy this CD, because it is the first album of the greater grunge band.  NIRVANA >> ONE OF THE FEW BEST BANDS OF THE WORLD... ETERNALLY...   KURT LIVES!!!
0316067598|5.0|Don't bother reading reviews, buy the book.  Must read, instant classic.  It will take it's place beside \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Blackhawk Down\\" as two of the classic novels of war.

0757302661|2.0|I ordered this book to educate myself on hypnobirthing prior to attending the birth of my sister's fourth child (her second \\"hypnobirth\\").  I've never given birth, and I wanted something that would teach me how hypnobirthing worked so that I could be helpful in the delivery room.    The light-touch massage was absolutely the best thing I did to help my sister, so I am definitely glad Mongan suggests it.  The information about trying to relax and not be afraid so that your body and your baby can birth naturally was helpful, although I thought her relaxation techniques were on the goofy side.  My sister seemed to like them, though, especially the \\"blue ribbon\\" visualization in which you imagine your uterine muscles as soft, blue ribbons opening and floating (or something like that) to make room for your baby.  Other than this and a couple of equally silly (in my inexperienced opinion) visualizations, there wasn't much practical information.    Instead, there was plenty of marketing information for her classes, enough anti-medical-establishment propaganda to seriously grate on one's nerves, and a lengthy history of the medicalization of childbirth (which would have been interesting in four pages or less).  One of my biggest clues that Mongan was not my style was her list of no-no \\"medical\\" terms such as \\"birth canal\\" that she wants replaced with euphemism-words like \\"birth passage.\\"    There were at least thirty pages or so with helpful information, and for that, I am glad I read the book, since I knew nothing about hypnobirthing.  I would love to see a more scientific book on hypnobirthing, but if you dislike science, then you may not find this book lacking.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was such a fun, entertaining series, I don't know why they canceled it.  Good, believeable Sci-Fi is so rare, and this series had the bonus of having actors who could actually act.  It's such a shame that they canceled the show, I hope they will bring it back in the future.
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|Rihanna definitely made the effort to step up to a more mature sound on this album. The new sound is not half bad either. However, alot of the tracks sound rushed and like no effort was put into them. The beats are solid and there are some memorable lyrics as well. Overall, Id say this cd is worth lending an ear to. Her other 2 are better, though. Hot Tracks: Umbrella, Rehab, Good Girl Gone Bad
0739350323|3.0|Blending actual historical figures with mythological monsters and pagan deities, the world of the Alchemyst blurs the lines of reality to the point of surreality.  Potter Fans will remember Nicholas Flamel as a maker of the Philosopher Stone in Book 1 of that series.  Well, let's say that in the world of The Alchemyst, Harry and Co. are popular fictional characters, just as they are in reality.  Where as Nicholas Flamel is an actual historical figure, born in France in the fourteenth century.<br /><br />This book, the first in a series of I believe six, throws you into the action with very little preamble.  A magic battle, mud monsters, a legendary book, and a 2,000+ year old teenage warrior-goddess punk rocker (seriously) come into the story within the first few chapters.<br /><br />Author Scott has set himself a nice playing field for subsequent books in this series.  And while not as detailed as some other books in the genre, it more than makes up for it with lots of action.  The story of Nicholas Flamel has five more opportunities to flesh out its world.  I am looking forward to spending more time there.<br /><br />BTW, my magic smells like liquorice.
0743496728|4.0|In nineteen minutes a world can be turned upside down, inside out, and transform into a hell on earth.  That's what happens inside Sterling High School. It's like Columbine happening all over again, only we get to listen in and get acquainted with the shooter, families, and victims.     I love Jodi Picoult's writing technique----the reader is allowed to climb inside every character's psyche, perspective, opinion, and view of the world.  And we get to meet the shooter in an intimate way.      Reading \\"Nineteen Minutes,\\" I thought-- \\"Who gives a damn about Peter Houghton, he's a killer, a monster.\\"  But Picoult being the author she is, brings us on a journey of the past and present of Peter's childhood, the taunting, the bullying, and the terror of his every day existence.     On his first day of Kindergarten, his mom has packed a lovely lunch in his little tin box: sandwiches, Twinkies, an apple.  Somebody throws the whole box out of the bus window and the reader is left with an image of a large red apple rolling down the cement highway.  And this is only the beginning of Peter's tormented school experience.    Alright, this is not a justification for Peter to murder ten high school classmates, which is ridiculous, it is a scenario of how one can be pushed to the edge. The reader may feel empathy and even a little understanding for this poor, redheaded, freckle faced misfit.    The narrative weaves back and forth, each character getting his or her chance to speak, scream, cry, or analyze the tragedy:  Peter's mom, the families of the victims, the students, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and teachers.       In the end, the readers can decide if they truly want to forgive Peter or understand him or   sympathize with him.      One thing for sure, Picoult will bring the readers on a roller coaster ride of emotion and heartbreak and indecision.  Nothing, absolutely nothing-- is ever only black or white or this way or that way.    \\"I never found who I really wanted to kill.\\" Peter confesses to his attorney.    \\"Who was that?\\" He asks    \\"Myself.\\"  Peter says.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|If you are a fan of the Final Fantasy titles from the Playstation 1 days, you're going to watch this sometime. If you felt confused and empty about FFVII's ending, you are defintely going to watch this.<br />The best CGI made movie I have ever seen. It is great to see these characters that you used to level up, equip, and actually gave a damn about be revamped from the deformed pixle polygons that kept you busy for many hours into very life like CGI. My favorite scene and also one that I always wanted to see, was Cloud vs Sephiroth. \\"Oh %&$#!\\" was the only thing I could say as I stared at my two favorite characters duke it out once again. Some of my friends thought the flying around bit was kinda cheesey. I just simply said, they're at maxed out levels. (insert haha)<br />But, that's when the story and plot come in. It... kinda sucked, and made not much sense. If they worked on it to be a satisfactory plot, it probably would end up as a 4 hour movie,...or another game. This did have a better ending than FFVII's original one though.<br /><br />The big bonus I thought about this dvd, was the FFVII story recolection feature. It sort of helps people new to this game understand it, but not really. Hoever, I loved it because of the memorable recap.
B00008BRBG|5.0|It is hard to believe that a band can become a Hall of Fame band with just five studio albums to their name, but the Police are such a band.   This is an honor that the Police are most worthy of. The Police were sort of an off-shoot of the Punk Rock movement of the late 1970s.  The band would eventually encompass other influences - namely Classic Rock, Reggae, Jazz, Dance, and even Folk.   For the most part, it is fair to say there was a Punk Rock and Reggae influence on the band for their first two albums\\" - \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" and \\"Regatta de Blanc\\".   Both of these albums were terrific efforts - mostly because The Police used applied their unique style to a formula that worked.  The album that would start it all would be their debut, \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\".    This album would lay the foundation for what would become a worthy Hall of Fame career.    One thing where the Police really show their potential is through their instrumentation.  While many identify the band with Sting's distinctive voice, he often goes underrated for being an outstanding  Bass player.  While Sting's Bass provides a lot of the nucleus that will drive the Police's sound, it is important to know that Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland play equally key roles on the band's sound.  Andy Summers provides the right chords from an Electric Guitar standpoint when needed while Stewart Copeland shows why he is the best in the business.       While this first album does have a \\"raw\\" sound, it is the contributions of all three members that really make the Police something special.  Here is a brief synopsis of each of the tracks.    \\"Next to You\\":  This is classic sounding Punk song.   This song deals with loneliness - a theme heard on several songs on this album.  It has a very raw sound to it, but it is what gives this song its charm.   We immediately hear good synchronization between Sting's Bass and Copeland's drumming.  Summers' guitar work midway through the song provides a perfect bridge.    \\"So Lonely\\": This song was a song that has remained a classic throughout the Police's career.  Again this has a raw sound.  From the title, it clearly deals with the theme of loneliness.  The main verses have a slight Reggae feel to it.  Summers' guitar is flawless on the chorus.  Copeland's drumming is outstanding throughout  - especially as it builds up toward the finale of the song.    \\"Roxanne\\": The only thing negative about this song is that it has been overplayed way too much.  While Sting's vocals are the highlight, Summers' delivers an Reggae-styled guitar chords throughout the song giving it a nice signature.    \\"Hole in My Heart\\": This song takes a little getting used to.   This is another raw song shows another nice fusion between Punk and Reggae.  Like \\"So Lonely\\", this song deals with the topic of loneliness and like \\"So Lonely\\", this song has a nice build up at the end.    \\"Peanuts\\": Best song on the album and perhaps one of the best Police songs ever.   This is a complete effort by the whole band.   The band stays true to their Punk influences on this one as it takes aim at the gossip that infiltrates the media.   The horn sounds at the end really give this song its own signature.  While Sting is the primary songwriter on all ten tracks, this is the one track that Stewart Copeland contributes to.    \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\":  We hear the cross between Reggae and Punk in this song.   This song also hits the loneliness theme. This song also has a very raw feel.  Like \\"So Lonely\\", this has gone on to become a classic.  While this is a very good song, this song when done live is even better.    \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\": This song has a Punk feel to it.  This song is underrated as it is a complete effort by the band - from Sting's vocals, to Andy Summers' spot-on guitar work to some ferocious drumming by Stewart Copeland.      \\"Born in the 50s\\":  While the title suggests talking about the 50s, it really talks more about life in the 1960s (i.e. growing up in the 60s, one was born in the 50s).  There are references to the Kennedy Assassination, the Communists, Nuclear War, and the Beatles.  I've heard references that this song drags a bit. I tend to agree to some extent with those references, but this is still not a bad tack.    \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\":  While Sting is the primary songwriter on all ten tracks, this is the one track that Andy Summers has a contribution.  The song is one of the most unique ones in the Police catalog.  It combines Punk sound with a spoken poem read by Andy Summers embedded midway through the song.  Despite the \\"raw\\" sound of the musical part, there is a good segue between the music and spoken word.  This is another underrated track.  It is innovative songs like this that helped set the foundation for the Police's Hall of Fame career.     \\"Masoko Tanga\\":  A lot of people forget that the Police have done several instrumentals throughout their career.   Whether this song classifies as a true instrumental is still up for debate as Sting delivers some Caribbean-Sounding reggae words throughout the song.   Sting also demonstrates some of his strongest Bass work on the album in this song.  This song really picks up midway through the song.   Again - another underrated track by the Police.      One thing worth noting about this album being available in a \\"digipak\\" - I am not a big fan of it.  I still prefer the classic clear jewel case for durability as the \\"digipak\\"s tend to wear very quickly.  Overall, this is a very good album.   It has one of the most unique sounds and clearly sets a foundation for the next four albums made by the Police.  Highly recommended.

1594489505|5.0|A very sad set of tales in a culture that most Americans can't fathom.  You want to be hopeful for Afghanistan, its women and girls (and even its men and boys,) but dread the outcome after reviewing the current events.  The depiction of the characters is excellent, the windows into Mariam's and Laila's souls allows you to understand much of their motivation and Afghan culture.  The depiction of the two main male characters isn't as intriguing or understandable, but not an overall detriment to the story.  The action portrayal is somewhat lacking in believability, but again, and for the most part, the lack thereof doesn't diminish from the book.  Overall, the book is a page burner.  Read it and count your lucky stars.  The book is as good, if not better, than Kite Runner.
1554072840|1.0|This book is too long, not age appropriate and is annoying to read. The pictures aren't really age appropriate for a young child (perhaps it would be better if you had an older child you were trying to potty train - but I doubt it). The only thing my daughter enjoys is looking for the pages with poopoo on them. Don't waste your money on this one. There are many other cute potty training books out there. I just bought the sesame street one and my daughter loves it and I don't mind reading it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I am not familar with John Mayer's work prior to \\"Continuum\\", but this dude got it right with this particular disc. I was drawn in by his breakout song \\"Waiting on the world to change\\" impressed with its political conscience.  But after listening to the whole disc a number of times, the other outstanding songs unfolded.<br /><br />  The song \\"Slow dancing in a burning room\\" was the first song to jump out at me; any person that has been in a tumultuous relationship can definately relate.  The lyrics in that song are amazing.  After I wore that song out, I noticed \\"Gravity\\" and its awesome lyrics.  Next, was the old Hendrix song \\"Bold as Love\\" Mayer might not be on Hendrix's guitar playing level, but he does a masterful job on this one.  The more uptempo \\"Belief\\" then caught my ear. A song I believe is ultimate truth. Finally I felt the flavor of \\"Dreaming with a Broken Heart\\" A very haunting and compelling song and performance by Mayer.<br /><br />  He will be performing with Eric Clapton tommorow Bryant PK NYC 7.00AM free. They say get there early, but if he is with Clapton you might have to camp out the day before. I don't know the classification of Mayer's music, but I do believe this record brings back \\"excellent\\" lyrical content to the mainstream.

Or dignity. Or character development or story. Graphic sex aside, the \\"film\\" is more pornographic in the theme it so clumsily conveys: commitment be darned, sexual gratification is an individual right and the key to happiness.

B000002KD9|5.0|After his first stint in CSN&Y, Neil Young headed right back in the studio with both of his former collaborators, Crazy Horse and Jack Nitzche, as well as a new addition, Nils Lofgren.  The album was recorded in a tiny studio where the performers were literally on top of one another.  This cramped recording atmosphere translates onto the record, but not in a bad way.  It comes across as almost terrifyingly intimate.      The snarl of a guitar, the warm sound of a piano, and the natural haunting beauty of Young's otherworldly-gospel voice has never sounded more pertinent and relevant as on this album.      This album also finds Neil Young at a perfect balance between rock God (Southern Man) and song-spinner (Don't Let It Bring You Down.)  This was the beginning and the end of a great era for an artist whose sound and direction changes faster then that of his unique guitar solos.  From here he would trudge through commercial success and failure with almost no rhyme or reason, but as he sings, \\"It's only castles burning. . .\\"

0807126063|5.0|John Kennedy Toole was a genius, and this book was probably the greatest I've had the pleasure to read, and I've read many.  So, I will not repeat the many eloquent praises to him and his work here, though I have greatly enjoyed reading them.  I just want to try to bring people's attention to the fact that Ignatius meets the criteria for a diagnosable mental illness, a personality disorder called Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which is a very isolating and very sad disorder, the more so because people afflicted with it never get any sympathy from those around them.  Indeed, they are cannot ask for it, because they are not themselves aware that they need it; they are too ill even to see this aspect of their lives.    Many people (certainly everyone intelligent enough to have read and appreciated Confederacy and to be reading reviews of it) have heard of Narcissists, of someone being disparagingly referred to as a Narcissist, meaning s/he is self-absorbed, conceited, etc.  However, Narcissistic P.D. has been recognized as a set of characteristics so extreme that they cause the person distress and disable them socially and/or professionally.  Ignatius was certainly disabled in both ways, and though I began the book angry and disgusted with him as several other reviewers, as I read on I realized that he was not a \\"bad\\" person, he was just ill, and then I began to pity him even while being frustrated with his behavior, as we often are with the manifestations of mental illnesses.     I will not try to summarize the criteria here, but you can easily find them and more information about this disorder with an internet search.  But let me explain that Ignatius' apparent arrogance and sense of superiority is exactly the opposite; whereas a normal person can handle the sense of mediocrity that we all have to come to terms with in at least some if not all aspects of who we are, a person with NPD, due to some great humiliations by an authority figure in their early childhood,cannot bear to face the pain that that would cause them, because they were made to feel such a tremendous amount of guilt and shame associated with their not being \\"good enough.\\"  So, they cordon off any sense of less than greatness to one part of their mind (subconsciously) and they run like h*ll to the other side, and stay there, forever.  Ignatius is not really a jerk, he's just out of balance, and he's imbalanced out of a fear, a terror, really, that he doesn't consciously know he has.  So, though we despise people who act like he does, who blame everyone else for their shortcomings or mistakes, who seem to look denigrate others and hold themselves higher than everyone else in every way, to the point of it being comical, they are in fact some of the saddest, loneliest people on earth.  And the most hopeless; due to the nature of their insanity, they very rarely get help - they cannot tolerate the terror of the thought that they may be less than perfect, because their father used to beat the crap out of them for making mistakes, etc., etc.      So, though I agree wholeheartedly that Confederacy of Dunces is a brilliantly original work, beautifully and skillfully written, I hate to inform you that Ignatius is unfortunately not as original as you probably thought.  He exists.  He is a deadbeat dad who gambled away all his money, blames his problems on his ex-wife and everyone else, and thinks himself too smart to go to college or get therapy.  He's lots of people in this world that we write off as \\"jerks,\\" not seeing the pain and terror behind their actions.  Toole portrayed Ignatius with incredible humor and a geniune literary talent, but with such a level of insight that I have to wonder if he himself suffered from NPD.  It is hard to imagine that someone with NPD could step outside himself enough to write someone with his disorder so well, but equally difficult to fathom that anyone could write Ignatius who had not lived his experience to some degree.  We willnever know, sadly, very much about this incredibly talented and apparently sad author, but I would hazard to guess that he knew exactly what disorder his protagonist suffered from and would have liked to have the sympathy you felt for Ignatius by the end of the story not end there, but to extend to all those like him in our world.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Master and Commander<br /><br />Fabulous View from the Crowe's Nest<br /><br />I avoided \\"Master and Commander\\" for awhile, unwilling to face disappointment. The movie looked cool, and with the ever-admirable Russell Crowe at the helm, seemingly a sure winner. But what if it was terrible?<br /><br />I finally faced my fear and found to my delight that \\"Master and Commander\\" is a wonderfully rich and varied experience that was well worth the wait. The film's action is fairly straightforward. An English man-o-war, the \\"Surprise,\\" must intercept the much swifter and stronger French \\"Acheron\\" before it reaches the Pacific and spreads Napoleon's empire into that hemisphere. But to this basic period chase story is added a fast-paced plot, a wonderful cast, superb effects, excellent performances and more twists than a cat-o-nine. Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, a brave and audacious pilot who has spent much of his life aboard the Surprise. The boat is well past its prime, but Audrey knows how to squeeze every ounce of speed out of her. Paul Bettany shines, or rather glowers as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is a cynic, an old friend of Aubrey's and the ship's talented surgeon, whose land-bound habits and moral code make him a perfect foil for Crowe. When the two aren't fighting each other, they are playing classical strings pieces in the Captain's cabin.<br /><br />\\"Master and Commander\\" masterfully mixes disparate are elements - the sailors' superstitions and their Christian piety when burying at sea; their fighting prowess alongside their tenderness toward their sick comrades; their love of grog along their dogged will to work. The film includes a number of scenes and characters that could easily have descended into clich&eacute;: the amputation; the noble-yet-caring captain; the encounter with native women. But smart writing and a focus on the mission keep both the Surprise's crew and the film's plot focused. Special applause goes to Max Pirkis as a doughty young midshipman. Sharp-eyed viewers will also note Billy Boyd (filmed in the midst of his role as Pippin in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\") as a rambunctious coxswain.<br /><br />M&C is quick-footed and thrilling, with battle scenes that are breathtakingly brutal. The effects of cannon shot on a ship's hull have never been so convincingly rendered. The camaraderie among the crew is heartwarming and sincere. The plot line is far from predictable. And finally, a movie that does not insult a viewer's intelligence! The film's final shot tells us, without needing to show us, what happens as the credits are rolling. Terrific, terrific, terrific!<br /><br />(There are no DVD extras to speak of apart from a few previews. Alas! But so much the more to preserve the story's magic!)Boyd (filmed in the midst of his role as Pippin in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\") as a rambunctious coxswain.

B000002KOG|3.0|After leaving Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young set off to establish himself as a solo artist.  His first effort found him working again with Jack Nitzche, who had been present for some of the Buffalo Springfield efforts, and ended up choosing to work with Young over the (at the time) more obviously commercially  viable Stephen Stills.  The result is an uneven offering by an artist whose career would be defined as uneven.  Young sounds uncertain about the material he is presenting, plus the production is very slick and rehearsed (something noticeably different from the subsequent albums Young would offer.)    Overall, this is not a failure of a record (Last Trip to Tulsa and The Loner assure this album its proper place in the Neil Young lexicon.)  It is simply a record offered by a young man trying to find his voice in an uncertain time with a new type of sound that may have been a hard sell.

B00005JPFC|4.0|I was a little apprehensive about watching a movie about a rat who likes to cook.  However, two things got me interested in it.  The first was the director, Brad Bird, who wrote, directed, voiced, and probably did make-up for \\"The Incredibles\\"... what I believe is one of the greatest animations of all time.  What clenched it for me was a review by somebody who's opinion I trust.    First, we were treated by the usual Pixar short animation before the movie.  Oh, how I love these.  They are cute, short, hilarious, and often unpredictable.  The one preceding this movie was no exception.    We were then treated to the movie.    You first get to know Remy (the rat that everybody sees in the advertising) and his family.  He isn't happy with his life because he does not get to do the one thing that he wants to do the most... cook.  But when his rat colony needs to move suddenly he loses contact with his loved ones but finds himself in Paris and meets Linguini, an employee at a restaurant who couldn't properly make a batch of ice if requested.  The problem with being a rat is that you aren't openly welcomed in anybody's kitchen.  However, after a series of interesting events, Remy and Linguini team up to become the cooking sensation of Paris.    Hilarity ensues.    The story is good and it works.  I like the message, which is basically to not judge a book by its cover.  The characters grow and we end up really interested on how everybody turns out.  Like other Pixar movies, it had everything you could wish for in a movie.  If you like other Pixar movies, there is little reason to not pick this movie up.    So why only four stars?  Three reasons.    The first is my OCD rearing its head.... there was a freaking RAT in the KITCHEN touching all the FOOD!!!  Sorry, I just could not get over that.  I'd probably be more accepting of a cat, dog, or otter... but a rat?  One of the most diseased animals ever?  Did the writers ever hear of a little event knows as the GREAT PLAGUE??!?!But, that is just me.  I know, I know... he washes his hands, but still.    The second is the mechanism that Remy and Linguini come up with so they could cook together.  This was more unbelievable than talking and cooking mice.  I guess it would have been more difficult to come up with something else but with Brad Bird's genius I think he just came up with something easy instead of clever.    Lastly, this was in Paris.  There should have been a LOT more France jokes.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|MISS POTTER introduces us to the woman who invented Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and all the other characters that have enthralled generations of children.  Renee Zellweger turns in a delicate and well-rounded performance in the title role, with fine support from Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson.<br /><br />In Victorian-era London, Miss Beatrix Potter (Renee Zellweger) is a 32-year-old spinster still living at home with her parents (Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn).  Her prospects for landing a husband evaporated long ago, so Beatrix decides to parlay her talents at painting and telling stories into a career as a children's author. The \\"bunny book\\" is rejected by many publishers until F. Warne & Co. decides to take Beatrix on, albeit reluctantly as a project for the shy and inexperienced Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor).  With help from Norman, a whole new world opens up to Beatrix, and in turn, Norman discovers his real feelings for his client.<br /><br />While MISS POTTER may take some small liberties with the truth, it's an endlessly-delightful movie treat for the whole family.  Renee Zellweger invests the character of Beatrix with an edgy, modern sensibility; in many respects Beatrix Potter was a woman born generations ahead of her time, refusing to accept conventions and existing on her own terms.  As previously utilised in the \\"Bridget Jones\\" movies, Zellweger's British accent is extremely convincing.  The movie also explores Potter's efforts to raise awareness in environmental conservation for the Lake District.<br /><br />The supporting cast is sublime.  Ewan McGregor delivers a deft and touching portrayal as the shy Norman, with Emily Watson perfectly-cast as his forthright sister Millie.  Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn manage to make a great impression as Potter's parents; they walk the fine line between reality and caricature.  Lucy Boynton is marvellous as the younger Beatrix in the flashback sequences.<br /><br />MISS POTTER is a delightful feel-good movie, wholesome without being sickly-sweet, and with a magnificent cast.  The period photography and costumes are beautiful as well.  I urge anyone who has ever been touched by the magic of the Beatrix Potter books to see this movie...you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD includes the featurette \\"The Making of a Real-Life Fairytale\\", \\"When I Taught You How to Dance\\" music video with Katie Melua, audio commentary with director Chris Noonan, and the trailer.

B000PFUA9G|3.0|After burning a hole in my copy of Paisley's previous effort, \\"Time Well Wasted\\", I was hoping to do the same with 5th Gear.  Unfortunately, this most recent work by one of Country's best musicians and song writers left me wanting.  Very few songs on the CD are so good that you have to hear them again and again.  Aside from Ticks, I can't think of another song on the CD that has a catchy beat and matching lyrics.  I got this CD the day before I drove cross country (3800 miles) and I listened to it several times during those long days on the road.  Suffice to say I'm glad \\"Time Well Wasted\\" was still in my truck as I ended up listening to that.  Not every CD can be as dynamic as \\"Time\\" but I was expecting a stronger follow up than Brad delivered.  All that being said, when he comes to DC, I'll go to the concert since few artists put on such a great live show.

0385486804|2.0|I think it's telling that my students, for the most part, did not enjoy reading this text. As college students who are largely lower to middle class, many the children of immigrants, I expected them to relate to this tale of young adult independence. However, they found Chris' journals to be self-centered and unrealistic. They frequently commented on his lack of caution and were largely unsympathetic to his attempts to escape society.<br /><br />I think there are many ways of approaching this text and some of the views of my students could be called an oversimplification. However, I also found the text to be overwrought. The narrator does distance us from McCandless by virtue of his ability to comment on the situation knowing how his journey ends. Still, the overall impression the text gives is that escaping the materialism of society is virtuous and heroic. Issues of gender, class and race are all but invisible in the text, yet they completely inform the undercurrents of the text: a young white male from a fairly well-to-do family is bored with the trappings of life and refuses to indulge himself in the benefits of his position. While he may turn away from privilege, he does not turn toward a world that could use more of these benefits, he turns away from it into an isolated and clearly idealized vision of the natural world.<br /><br />This book is a fairly easy read and, if you are compelled by the main character, I can see the attraction to the text, but overall I found it to be self-indulgent about the idea of the individual and about narratives of escape and materialism that seem all too common amongst those who \\"have.\\"

Told them I had borrowed the book from the library and answered their other questions (full name (why?), id code (which I had already provided), title of publication). A few days later, they responded with a sales pitch about their other publications and that I must buy one new for a code. Nice marketing. Forget it. One of my strengths is not to waste time or money on companies that lie and are motivated purely by greed. ;)

B0007PLLQ0|4.0|If you want a movie that will satisfy your thirst for a good, classic fantasy flick, then definitely pick up a copy of Legend. It has a nostalgic feel when you watch this movie, with the 80's soundtrack and young actors, and it is a film that is worth watching several times and sharing with your friends, family, and even children. From demons to unicorns, fair maidens to heroic men, and elves to fairies, this movie has it all. The only reason I would ever dock points from this film is the fact that there are a few moments of cheesy acting and the fact that the battle scenes are not as impressive as some of our modern fantasy films, such as Lord of the Rings. However, I would rank this movie to be one of my all-time favorites.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is a really good album. This band has a lot of depth and a lot of talent. Every song is very enjoyable. There is rythm and difference between songs, I listen to these guys and they blow the new Velvet Revolver album away (Libertad). The lyrics are awesome. Sounds like I'm hyping them up, but I'm being impartial, this band has talent. I like the album actually better than Karmacode. The combination of the male and female vocals on the album is really cool, Christina Scabbia has an awesome voice and comes through very nicely and so is the lead singer guy, great voice. I would compare this album to the type of music from P.O.D. or a little bit from Type O Negative (but toned down from Type O, definitely not gothic). The guitar work is really amazing, these guys rock!! You will not be dissapointed with this album.

This book happened to pop off the shelf at me at the book store about two weeks after I saw the DVD \\"the secret\\" which compelled me to pick it up since he was the author.  I did not realize that the book was just published a few weeks before that.  I'm writing this review on Amazon (which happens to be my first review) to thank him because his success is certainly well deserved.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This vivid re-enactment of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous survival of the Holocaust is presented before our eyes, in excruciating detail, by master filmmaker Roman Polanski. The true beauty of the film is the artistic, psychological, and moral apex achieved in the film itself, and in the lives of two great artists, Szpilman and Polanski himself. In the documentary (included in the DVD) of the making of the film, Polanski states one of the main themes of the film, that the love of his art helped to inspire Szpilman to survive the war against insurmountable odds. Polanski's words are so poignant; yet, one has the distinct impression that Polanski does not consciously realize he is talking about himself as well. The lives of Szpilman and Polanski are deeply intertwined. Haunted by tragedy and inner demons his whole life and career, Polanski rarely if ever displayed the moral courage to confront thematically in his films his innermost demons, arising from his own wartime experiences as Holocaust survivor from Krakow, and of course later on, from the murders of his wife and unborn child. Polanski descended into sexual diversions, scandal, and exile. How gratifying to watch his cinematic triumph, at age 70, in this deeply personal tale of courage and, not far beneath the surface, of moral redemption, a moral lesson and an inspiration for all.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I had a hard time trying to decide which pregnancy dvd's to purchase...but i've always been fitness savvy and wanted to stay fit during my first pregnancy. I was wary after reading some reviews of this one but I absolutely love it! It was challenging in my first trimester and it is still challenging now, in my 8th month. I don't do it every day, but I find it is a good thorough workout when I'm feeling like I've been sitting around too much (which is often!!). I also bought Shiva Rea's pregnancy yoga dvd and find that the two complement one another very nicely - good to alternate days with. Before pregnancy I was \\"working out\\" perhaps 2 days a week, by walking  , stretching, and doing light weights. But I feel like both of these dvd's are simply enough to follow for people of all fitness levels.
0743454537|4.0|there is not much to add to the reviews, this story was absolutly incredable. some parts did seem to drag on however, was alll that history about campbell and julia really necesicary? other than that Jodi Picoult did an amaizing job of telling a story about a sensitive subject that isn't talked about all that often. there were many clever lines and extremely well-rounded characters. and it was all heart-wrenchingly brought together by a very unexpected ending that leaves you satisfied, yet still extremely unsatisfied. great book that i would suggest to anyone! :]
B000NVIGC0|5.0|My husband loves Jay Farrar.  I love Jeff Tweedy.  I introduced him to Uncle Tupelo in 1992 and he became a true believer, as we all were at the time.  Yet he, as well as many, many hard-core alt-country fans, remains unwilling to understand the process of change and the need to challenge oneself musically.  Screw the fans with ego.  Sometimes that's O.K.    I admit, I've had a hard time with some of my other favorite bands' evolution from their early works to what they've now become (e.g. R.E.M.), but somehow, Wilco's growth has not bothered me one bit.  Maybe because I see the importance of following what you believe in as an artist (and maybe because now I'm over 40).  Maybe I just have empathy for what Jeff Tweedy has gone through in the last 20 years.    Sky Blue Sky doesn't sound like what people may think Wilco SHOULD sound like, but really, what SHOULD Wilco sound like?  The point is, Tweedy follows his calling, and it's not always what's expected.  This new album has more elements of his earlier works--the U.T. roots stuff--than any of the band's more recent efforts, from \\"Summerteeth\\" on.  Tracks like the title \\"Sky Blue Sky,\\" \\"Please Be Patient with Me,\\" and \\"What Light\\" are so reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo, it makes my heart weep.  What more do you want?    Personally, \\"A Ghost is Born\\" is one of my favorite Wilco albums, because of its noisy, disturbing guitar solos (just the fact that Tweedy, who's NOT a lead guitarist, played lead on that album is enough for me).  That album, the precurser to his time in drug rehab, has a disjointedness and a pleading cry to it that is hard to ignore.  Yet, the more refined sound on \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" (thanks mainly to Nels Cline joining as lead guitarist) should not be dismissed as just another one of Tweedy's \\"moods.\\"  This album has merit--forget all the references to the blankety-blank Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan and all the other 70's crap America can't seem to get enough of or get over.  Listen up and hear what Tweedyand the band are trying to say.  Long live 'em, I say.  Tweedy turns 40 soon; give him the credit he deserves.  Not many in his shoes and with his upstart background in the music scene could even come close to his talent.  Keep up the good work Wilco, it's well worth the listen...and listen, and listen, and listen.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I love this CD - I loved Never Again the first time I heard it on American idol, but it took me a few times through to like the CD in total, but if you listen, it tells a story of her pain and healing.  My boyfriend thinks she is just male bashing, but I don't agree at all.  It is like her singing is her therapy.  Anyhow, I love it.  Her singing moves me because it is coming from her heart and you can tell!
B000068TPN|5.0|I have probably seen every war movie made because my husband likes them.  This one dealt also in the story lines of women getting the news from other wives that their husband weren't ever coming home not just the men out there in the field as some movies.  I thought it was very good.  It did hit a little close to home though with what all our country is going through now.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Excellent Work!!!  Awesome pictures and the only TRUE way to enjoy it is in FULL HD.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I took a risk by purchasing this expensive collection of Alias DVD's because of the rave reviews for this show. Prior to buying it, I think I only saw about 1 or 2 episodes of Alias. I watched a few episodes and soon I was hooked! You will watch episode after episode just to find out what happens next!     This is a wonderful series and it is well worth the cost! Not only do you get the DVD's, but you also get the amazing Rambaldi artifact box (which is a sight to see in itself!). Alias is now my favorite TV show so far. 5 Seasons equals loads of episodes and unforgettable entertainment that will keep you at the edge of your seat at all times. This is a must watch!
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Dream Theater has done it again - an amazing album that showcases the immense technical abilities of the members as musicians without taking away from the poetry that is their music.  The DVD is also very entertaining and goes into a lot of fun detail on how the album were recorded and what kind of stories are behind the songs.
B00000DLVA|4.0|Nunca me llamo mucho la atencion los Cardigans. Sus etapas de \\"Life\\" y \\"Emerdale\\" eran muy vintage y muy mellow. Tal vez escuche \\"First band...\\" y ese fue el mejorcito. Pero Gran Turismo es algo completamente diferente, hay un enorme abismo que separa la calidad del sonido y tendencia entre GT y \\"Fist band\\". Puedo catalogar a este disco como el disco oscuro de la banda.   Canciones como Paralyzed y Marvel Hill son bastante chocantes si se las compara con \\"Pikebubbles\\" o \\"new Cokoo\\" de discos anteriores. Las primeras 8 canciones son las que le dan caracter a este disco, luego caen un poco en lo comercial con la 9 y la 10. Pero rematan con la instrumental \\"Nil\\" ,es buenisima!.. muy darkie , muy melodica.  Un disco buenisimo, de pronto el mejor que sacaron desde 1998. Musica eclectica bastante recomendada.
0618680004|5.0|One of the groups at my church discussed this book after reading it.  It was one of the best discussions we have ever had.   People read it, of course.  It would be impossible to discuss without a complete reading.   We planned the discussion months in advance and those who had not read the book were lost in the discussion.  Buy this for you church library.
B000P0J0DI|5.0|Clint Eastwood takes his place beside Western film-making legends John Ford (\\"The Searchers\\") and Sam Peckinpah (\\"The Wild Bunch\\") with this classic. Eastwood, in effect, questions the genre that made him the way John Wayne and John Ford did in \\"The Searchers\\" (through gritty realism). A big question you're left with at the end is \\"Do these people(Europeans/Americans) really represent civilization or is there a bit more to the story?\\"  Great cast but even greater approach in the storytelling. \\"Unforgiven\\" is unrelenting realism and that is messy. Witness -- clumsy and near-sighted cowboys, outhouse assassinations, moral ambiguity, guilt by association resulting in a man's death, killing prompts remorse (and sometimes not). Essentially, very weighty matters translated to the spaghetti Western (thus showing Old West more like it was than most such films dare depict to their jingoistic audiences).  Eastwood parodies his \\"Pale Rider\\" character and the mythic man on the white horse through playing a domesticated gunslinger who can't properly mount his horse or stay on it that well. Gene Hackman plays the cruel yet personable and smiling sheriff who happens to be a lousy carpenter. Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris add to the exotic mix. Harris's British bounty hunter makes light of presidential assassinations, another example of the dark humor that pervades \\"Unforgiven.\\" This film is not for laughs. \\"Blazin' Saddles\\" it ain't.    Eastwood's character delivers one of American cinema's most memorable lines about living and killing. Don't miss it.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I heard a few reggae songs that I liked, but this cd, which I originally purchased after seeing the video for \\"Road to Zion\\" featuring the ultra talented NAS, is the best cd I purchased in quite a while.  I can listen to every single song, and I am glad he included the words, because I have learned almost all of them.  Most of my friends do not give reggae a chance unless it's Sean Paul, but I tell them that Damian is \\"the truth\\", and listening to his music is not only entertaining, but uplifting, motivating and inspirational.  It's wonderful that Bob Marley had such talented children, and Damian is one of the most talented, like he says, verbally, no doubt, he is \\"nitroglycerin\\"!
B00005JPQT|2.0|Live Free or Die Hard  Aka Die Hard 4  2007    ** 1/2    Headline: This is the WORST of the series and a utter letdown.    I found this film a terrible letdown. The writing, the style and the feel were so different from the previous films. My gut feeling is that this story was slapped together and McClane was added into it.    The story at times feels so utterly generic that its an embarrasment to be the diehard franchise.    There is no wonderful mixing of energy (intensity, seriousness, subtle humor and over-the-top sequences). Die Hard 4 takes itself too seriously. It comes off as a CSI episode with McClane in it with a rare quip.    So in the end this feels like a prewritten film with John McClane added afterwards. For that and the overly serious tone of the film make it a huge disappointment.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. So I came home and had to get this album. If you like Damien Rice, then you will enjoy this album. I really love tracks 2 and 7.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|With the usual nods to John Williams' initial themes, Hooper takes everything  a notch higher with this score.  Perfect.
6302767741|5.0|I love this movie, it's one of my comfort films. Sadly, my vhs copy is wearing out. It needs to be available on DVD! And extra's would be really nice too.     I was really pleased to see all the good reviews, no one I know had ever heard of this movie before I mentioned it.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|Asian horror film makers seem to have an obsession with ghost stories, lately. Not all of the recent films ghost story films out of Asia are good, but Shutter is worth your time.    I wouldn't call Shutter a frightening film. \\"Creepy\\" is a the more accurate adjective. Specifically, the imaging is incredibly creepy. Make no mistake, the \\"visuals\\" are this film's strength.    Small weaknesses include the progressively complicated storyline which at times is quite hurried, lack of depth in character development and some not-so-believable details late in the film. All in all however, this is a good horror film, worth checking out.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Well glad this came out when it did. We have been updating or whs collection and trying to get dvd's as the kids are not willing to wait for rewind on the vhs and the tapes are worn. So this is great we love it and the color and sound is wonderful. Really good movie can't say enough.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|This early 70s gem was ripped off by more popular horror films of the late 70s and early 80s, and its a shame becuase it outshines all of them.    I had always maintained that the first half hour of the ORIGINAL \\"When a Stranger Calls\\" is one of the scariest pieces of film I'd ever viewed. That was before I saw Black Christmas (which, by the way, predates When a Stranger Calls). When a Stranger Calls starts off very strong and quickly goes down hill whereas Black Christmas goes above and beyond and is consistently creepy without the huge let down at the ending that is typical for many horror films.    There are a few things I didn't like, however. The story isn't completely hole-proof (but is very good for the era). The music/score in times of suspense was annoying as it sounded like someone carelessly pounding on a piano. It was a bit overused. The mumbling/moaning of the killer and his phone calls were like finger nails scratched down a chalk board. These are relatively minor details that do not hamper the effectiveness of this film sending chills down the viewer's spine!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I can't wait for season 3 to come out I love these shows and and so happy to have a set. I wish they did not change the music though as it is a bit korny and loud.
B00005JPLW|5.0|First off, I think this is one of the greatest films ever made.  These people complaining about the historic facts misrepresented or missing in the film are crazy.  Every movie based on true events and people are always different for entertainment reasons.  From Malcolm X to JFK.  From Braveheart to 300.  I cant speak for everyone, but all these films have made me look deeper into the history of what the film was based off.  Malcolm X made me want to read his book.  JFK made me want to watch documentarys about Kennedy.  American History X and Gladiator made me search the internet.  Braveheart had a pretty good indepth documentary about Wallace history and explain the freedoms they took with his history and why right on the same disc with the movie.  I think for some of those who want the history, 300 will jump start their interest.  I knew the story prior to seeing the movie, but it didnt make the movie wack... nor did the movie destroy or taint the truth.  And lets not forget, 300 is based off Frank Millers comic book.  Anyways, with all that to the side... the movie was super creative, visual, and to the point.  The plot did not seem drawn out and it was perfectly filled with action.  I really feel it did what Matrix should've done... set a new standard for that kind of film.  I hope we can expect more creative films like this.  It's always good to see people trying new ways of telling stories.  I think this movies deserves a 5 simply because it is a movie you will watch again and again with family and freinds.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth have always been one of my all time favorite bands, like Metallica they decided to take the alternate route and make more radio friendly albums.  Not since Rust In Peace have Megadeth been so In Your Face! From Sleep Walkers to Burnt Ice this album pounds you into submission.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|Sickening. Appallingly bad. Inept in every way. Horrible acting, singing, direction, photography, music. Stupid plot (a musical about AIDS!???).<br /><br />The worst film of all time.<br /><br />Why not a musical about starvation, or about torture, or about Anthrax?<br /><br />This film and the stage musical are insults to the intelligence.<br /><br />And those who marked this review as not helpful don't know what 'helpful' means.
B000002IO1|5.0|This is a great female rock album.  Alanah delivers rock on this album that is definitely hard at times, but never turns into just loud noise.  Quite the contrary, the album is full of good rock tunes.  Alanah's voice is powerful and with the right attitude.  The album starts out strong, rocking with Still Got This Thing, Love Is, and Black Velvet.  Rock This Joint is a bit commonplace.   Lover of Mine shows Alanah can do a softer, slower tune.  The album gets hard again with Kick Start My Heart and If You Want To.  Some mellower tunes close the album.  Excellent stuff.  Where's Alanah now?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I used 'one click' to order these DVDs and they arrived so quickly.  also, for whatever reason my shipping was only three dollars, so that was a bonus.  i haven't had a chance to watch these DVDs yet, but I'm sure they will be as good as the reviews say.

B000GG4XD8|5.0|The second part of the groundbreaking Keeper Of The Seven Keys! Now EXPANDED, containing 3 must-have Bonus Tracks and Remastered, providing an improved sound quality to the original release of 1988.<br /><br />To be fair (without being influenced by the love and respect I have for this album) PartII wasn't as good as the first one, but it came pretty close and was also longer in length. Nevertheless, Keeper II is a record containing some of the most known power metal songs ever! The album continues with the same energy and atmosphere as PartI but with the majority of the songwriting coming from guitarist Weikath and a slightly more commercial feel. All in all a wonderful conclusion to the first part.<br /><br />\\"Eagle Fly Free\\" is considered to be the best power metal song ever written. It is a fast paced number with thundering drums and comprises of dual guitar solos, melodic vocals and both a bass and a drum solo. \\"Dr. Stein\\" is a wonderful, melodic, funny (lyrics) and catchy heavy metal song. \\"March Of Time\\" is a technical, melodic and strong speed metal tune with an addictive and epic chorus. \\"I Want Out\\" is a catchy heavy metal song with a strong chorus that fulfills its purpose. \\"We Got The Right\\" is a strong power-ballad where Michael Kiske shines the most, delivering a breathtaking performance filled with melodic and high-pitched vocals.<br /><br />The progressive title track is a musical journey into a fantasy world and a battle between good and evil. A balladry intro, a melodic chorus, many guitar solos, tempo changes, brilliant twin-guitar passages, one of Kiske's most varying and powerful vocal performances and an epic ending round off this 13 and a half minute song. Overall Keeper has some magnificent ideas but it sadly can't surpass the masterpiece \\"Halloween\\" from the previous album. \\"Save Us\\" is the perfect speed metal closer with some amazing guitar solos, intense drumming and an excellent Michael Kiske.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks \\"Livin Ain't No Crime\\" and \\"Savage\\" are the best of the bunch. The first is a catchy and optimistic melodic metal tune and the second follows a thrash metal approach and is the fastest track on the album.<br /><br />Musically the album is characterized by mid-tempo and fast double-bass drumming, melodic and speed metal riffs, mindblowing guitar solos, excellent bass lines and outstanding vocals.<br /><br />The production is slightly better than the first part, as the album sounds tighter and kind of clearer. The band sounds a bit tighter too compared to their previous release. Michael Kiske has surely glued in the band and his charismatic voice gives you the chills throughout the whole album (he sings higher than ever, hitting all possible notes with great precision)!<br /><br />The only minor drawbacks are the track \\"Rise and Fall\\" which cannot by any means be considered a bad song, but doesn't seem to fit here...and the fact that most of the song writing was done by Michael Weikath, who is an exceptional songwriter and guitarist but not as good as Kai Hansen.<br /><br />This is a classic and groundbreaking record in the history shelves of metal, together with part I. A source of inspiration and influence to countless bands to follow. This is also the last chapter in the Helloween (80's) glorious era, from where onwards the band went downhill (in my opinion).<br /><br />A MUST HAVE for any power/speed,heavy metal and open-minded hard rock fan.<br /><br />(Be sure to check out \\"Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part I\\" and \\"I Want Out: Live\\")
B000002UA9|5.0|Amazing to think that this is the same group of lads that would give us their swan song Abbey Road a mere 6 years later. However, the youthfulness and exuberance on this album makes it a great beginning. I haven't had this in my collection for a while and listening to it again I marvel at the innocence of this release. Being a huge fan since childhood this isn't one of my top Beatles albums but it sure is a fun listen and definitely a record to purchase.
B000C4A1EE|5.0|By combining influences such as Iron Maiden, Queen, Judas Priest, Rainbow and Queensryche together with fast double bass drumming, higher pitched-melodic vocals, fabulous twin-guitar solos and catchy riffs, Helloween achieved to lay the foundations for European power metal, as it is known today.    In Keeper Of The Seven Keys part I the band changed its sound, from the speed metal that dominated their debut album, to a much more melodic, technical and epic approach. The songs were still fast paced and heavy but contained catchy melodies, memorable choruses, outstanding vocals and evoked an uplifting feeling.    But besides the captivating music, a new charismatic vocalist named \\"Michael Kiske\\" joins the band to take this album to the skies! Influenced by Bruce Dickinson and Geoff Tate; but equipped with more emotion and power, 18 year old Kiske makes this album a MUST HAVE for any metal and hard rock fan. (Kiske is still considered one of the best and most copied vocalists in the heavy metal genre)    The album begins with an operatic marching type intro which successfully sets the mood of the album. The intro leads nicely into the fast paced and uplifting \\"I'm Alive\\". The song carries an optimistic message and includes a memorable chorus, fast drumming, raving guitar solos and twin-guitar harmonies.    The heavy \\"A Little Time\\" comes next with another catchy chorus and an addictive guitar riff, while the melodic mid range vocals in the verses sound really emotional and warm.    The power ballad \\"A Tale that wasn't Right\\" arrives to slow things down a bit. It's strongest points are the truly emotional vocals and the wonderfully played guitar solo.    \\"Twilight Of The Gods\\" continues in the same vain as I'm Alive but is more epic, contains more intense vocals and a chorus that you'll never forget.    The heavy metal anthem and most famous track \\"Future World\\" follows next. It is performed in mid-tempo, includes one of the best twin-guitar solos of the album, funny lyrics and vocals that vary from low range to really high-pitched.    Next comes the true masterpiece of the album \\"Halloween\\"; an operatic, fast, progressive, melodic power metal hymn raving over 13 minutes (which never gets long nor tiresome). Halloween is probably one of the best metal epics ever. It contains an eerie chorus, tempo changes, varying vocals, choirs and hundreds of guitar riffs, leads and solos.    All of these songs are still considered classics and are also some of the best power metal songs ever written.    Even if you are not a metal fan, this album will please you or even blow you away with the mythical and uplifting atmosphere it creates and the technically proficient orchestration it achieves.     Will be loved by Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Queensryche, Rainbow...fans. Just listen...you'll be amazed!    (Definitely check out Keeper Of The Seven Keys pt II!!)
B000002UAC|5.0|For me these early Beatles discs are for a younger day. I listen now and know why I was caught up in the excitement too. They rocked! They also showed enough chutzpah to cover r&b material (sometimes better than the original recording artists) and introduce little known gems. And they did it all with amazing energy, fun and skill.
B000C4A1EO|4.0|Coming out from a law-suit after their label change and a huge line-up change which leaves legendary guitarist-songwriter Kai Hansen out of the band, Helloween come back with \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\\". A record which was bashed by music critics due to the fact that the band changed their music to a small effect when compared to their highly praised Keeper Of The Seven Keys records.     \\"Pink Bubbles...\\" admitably has a really strange, even silly title but this is not the case with the song writing. The music departs a bit from the continuous double-bass drumming stile and is enriched with more progressive and at parts mainstream ideas. Some songs are softer than the usual tracks found on the Keeper records reminding more of heavy metal than power metal, but that's not a drawback for sure.     Without diving into each and every song, I'm going to name only the outstanding ones! \\"Mankind\\" is a great-epic and progressive song with wonderful vocal and musical variations. \\"The Chance\\" is a mid-paced heavy metal anthem, which contains some of the albums best vocals and is the most known track from this relish. \\"Someone's Crying\\" is the only song that could be categorized as pure power metal (fast double-base drumming), a truly great song, which reminds a lot of their previous albums. \\"Your Turn\\" is a wonderful rock-blues ballad with great vocals and finally \\"Kids of the Century\\" is another fast song with smart lyrics and great solos.     The new guitarists R.Grapow proves to be a worthy replacement, as his guitar playing is outstanding and he also contributes some great tracks to the album. Vocalist Michael Kiske has improved even more (if that could be possible) in both technicality and emotion delivering his best vocal performance up to that point. While the other 3 band members, especially drummer Ingo, continue to show how talented musicians they are.     The main drawback of this album was the thin production, but now this relish offers a remaster of the original sound,thus a truly improved sound quality. The other drawback are tracks 1,5,9, but the 4 Bonus Tracks make up for that one also, especially the cover of Blue Suede Shoes.     You should definitely give this album a chance, if you enjoyed Helloweens previous relishes, as you can see how the band progresses and doesn't continue repeating itself for the sake of record sales.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|Why do these tracks have to be out of order? I really hate that!  The music is ok, could use more of the original themes to suit me though, I guess don't mess with success.    If anyone has a better order to these tracks (the order they are in the movie) please list it - that would be nice.

Finally the title track has some magnificent ideas but it sadly can't surpass the masterpiece \\"Halloween\\" of part I (the chorus is a little cheesy).

B000OCZD5G|5.0|So most people are already familiar with the story.  It is basically a post apocalyptic view of the world where society has completely broken down.  For action movies, this is a classic film.  However, we have not seen The Road Warrior in anything more that 480p since its original theatrical release.  I will say right now - this Blu-Ray disk does the movie justice.  The transfer is fantastic in both audio and video.  When the camera is low to the pavement at 100mph, you can see the texture in the road.  You can see the nasty, stringy hair on top Lord Humongous.  When Max busts open the shotgun shell, you can see the individual grains of powder.  This is a fantastic transfer of an action classic.
B000001EYW|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Bee Gees, short time before Maurice's tragic death, decided to end the millenium with an album very different and completely underrated. Still Waters remains as one of my Bee Gees' favorites, not their best work though its much more mature, possesing an adecuate number of ballads and joyful themes. The album's sound and mellodies are very nice but not as catchy as their past works, although it keeps an interesting musical direction and style. Ballads like the famous Alone, I Will, My Lover's Prayer, I Could Not Love You More and the title track are much more recognizable among their classic style, containing wonderful love themes with very mellodic sounds. Strong themes with more mature rythms but with a certain lack of good mellodies, where there is found a new musical style not seen before are found in the tracks I Surrender, With My Eyes Closed, Miracles Happen, Obsessions, Closer Than Close and Smoke And Mirrors; maybe Miracles Happen and Smoke And Mirrors still possess familiar sounds but excellent as well. A song that gets out of the album's structure is certainly Irresistible Force, wich is an incredible track very familiar to their songs at the end of the 70's, and has a fast but catchy rythm, nice lyrics and awesome mellodies. The only aspect that I didn't find very good was the adult contemporany type of songs seen in the whole album, a little dissapointing in this term, but anyway is excellent. In conclussion I liked the album a lot and I think other people will find it nice also, not their greatest effort but good for the ears, if you know what I mean.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|I liked this movie a lot because it is so near and dear to my own lifetime era.  I graduated from High School that year and found life was more confusing than when I began it 4 years earlier.  I was very moved, by the Writing of The Movie Writers and the actors seemed very comfortable in dealing with eachother in this movie.  I thought the last 15 or 20 minutes seemed a little bit of an overkill to it because of the shift of the dialogue to various places in the School.  That approach hurt the early goings of The Movie, I think, but what do I know?  I think it very closely tried to resemble \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\", though without a lot of dramatics since it was soley teleplayed in the school.  It was in the dialogue that I found a Natalie Wood and a James Dean, though slighlty more hardened than Judd Nelson's bit..  hehehe...  The movie was great.  Everyone should have a copy no matter your age.  God bless...  :)
B00004VW0V|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - we have to accept that it won't get better after Tea For The Tillerman and Teaser and The Fire Cat, but this album is excellent in his own special way!<br /><br />It's an awesome experimentation, but just because of that it left some wide open critics about the album, but don't get confused it's so nice and also without loosing his classic sounds. The Album has some very beautiful and changing mellodies, a rythm hard to describe in other albums, containing very comprehensible (and still very complex) compositions and a high level of orginality.<br /><br />The first track Foreigner Suite is of course the greatest track in the album, being a song that is constantly changing it's rythm and full of sweet mellodies, it last 18 minutes so you can enjoy it for a long time without getting bored, although it seems to go nowhere. The Hurt is the second best track, very catchy and comfortable, keeping a lot of his classic sounds. How Many Times is a good track, a little bit unmellodic but nice as well, dominated mainly by a piano. Later is another incredible track wich is a little bit dramatic and with that romantic flavour classic from Cat Stevens. 100 I Dream is my least favorite, the composition is ok but its too noicy.<br /><br />The only wrong aspect that I saw in this album was the poor production they applied.<br /><br />In conclussion, the cd is an incredible experimentation with its mellodic, changing moods its worth the purchase. Not dissapointing at all.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I'm not a critic, but I find myself hearing the Led Zeppelin influence. It is very gratifying. While I'm at work \\"Rag and Bone' keep haunting me. My favorite cut is \\"Slowly turning into you.\\"     How does a mere duo create the power of one of the greatest Rock band in history? I dunno.    I don't care that Jack is an eccentric nut-case. I really like his music. He must also be doing something right because he's still with his wife.    More power to him and all those like him.

0316067598|5.0|This story is almost beyond words. I have the strongest gratitude I can ever feel for your bravery and in the telling of the story as well sir.    May God bless the families of these heroes. For serving God and our country in the way all soldiers do, I say with pride, Thank You.    As a review, this book is just incredibly outstanding. It is a great story that had to be shared so we can get a glimpse of the honor and valor of these heroes who have helped preserve the rights we have today. The book is, like the other reviews say, a quick read (not short, but quick and compelling) and truly a work that honors those who do what they do day in and day out.    An excellent book. And a great man to tell the story. God bless you sir.
0385522401|5.0|I hated Ian McEwan's Atonement, I thought it was such a disingenuous jumble, but On Chesil Beach turned me into a convert. It's rare to find comedy this tender in contemporary fiction. It would also have been so easy for McEwan to lampoon Florence as she wanders like a frightened anthropologist into unknown terrain. But instead he uses sexual explicitness as a way of taking the high road with a character who's so terrified of \\"going all the way\\" that he himself goes all the way as a writer, allowing her to frantically mock herself as he lets us into the heart of her terror via a kiss. It's like being so intensely inside the fear of a person with a phobia that all you can see is how astounding it is, the horrified but wild lunge toward the next step.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I work for a living as a cinematographer, so I have seen a lot in this industry, but nothing compares to the visual compositions in this documentary.

B000HIVOI2|3.0|\\"Stargate\\" is, obviously, the movie that later spawned the hit \\"Stargate SG-1\\" TV series, and its spinoffs and side-movies. For that alone, it deserves a pat on the back.<br /><br />But taken on its own merits, \\"Stargate\\" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws. It uncomfortably straddles the fence between \\"shoot-em-up bombs'n'action\\" and \\"mythology sci-fi,\\" but provides a solid villain, some sketchy writing, and the foundation for a hit TV show. Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.<br /><br />Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job, when a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret military project. Soon he finds out why -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago, with strange symbols on a central ring. When they use his calculations, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.<br /><br />Obviously a recon team is sent through, led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell). This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent \\"god\\" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.<br /><br />It's a pretty straightforward action plot -- scientist opens gateway to new planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives who don't have a snowball's chance without outisde help. \\"Stargate\\" doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, massive ruins, ancient aliens, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.<br /><br />In fact, spectacle is what \\"Stargate\\" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's serpent-headed alien warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, the director apparently gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the prettyboy alien slinking around, because the middle part of the movie is very slow-moving.<br /><br />It's more clumsy at the intimate stuff of character development, such as Daniel's serious romance with a chief's daughter, or O'Neil's depression over his son. It just never feels natural or deep, no matter how hard the actors try. The accompanying dialogue is usually pretty solid, but sometimes gets downright clumsy (\\"I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to\\").<br /><br />Spade pretty much steals the show as a lovable geek who sticks to his guns, even if it makes him a laughingstock among the rough'n'tough soldiers around him. And the geek gets the girl, not the military grunts -- a nice change. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap (\\"How ya doin'? Hmm?\\"). And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English being spoken.<br /><br />\\"Stargate\\" is a fun movie for the spectacle and slam-bang action scenes, so long as the weak scripting doesn't hold you up.

0743496728|5.0|I have read about everything that Jodi Picoult has written and this is clearly her most compelling piece of work yet.  She has once again taken a topic that is timely and tells the story from the different viewpoints of the people involved.  Her character portrayals are poignant and sometimes gut-wrenching and painful.  Even though this is a work of fiction, it hit a chord with me, both as a parent and as a teacher.  I have recommended this book (and just about everything else that Jodi Picoult has written)to all the teachers that I know, to bring bullying into closer focus.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the best series of DVD I have ever seen.  The photography is outstanding and quite remarkable.  I would definitely recommend this set for all ages.  Wonderful!
0060578793|5.0|The thing I like about this book is that you can read it cover to cover -or- you can just pick it up and randomly flip to any page only to find something interesting. Full of useful information, the author does an excellent job at breaking down the concepts in this book into easy to remember principles and steps.<br /><br />I would suggest buying this for any survivalist/camper/hiker/outdoorsman in your life, it's a great gift.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The CD gives more sound, more detail and more depth to the titles chosen for the CD...After seeing Beatles LOVE Cirque de Soliel in Vegas last week, it brings you to an emotional and sensual high unlike any Cirque or compilation of Beatles music. You hear vastly mroe than any other Beatles CD... You KNOW the lyrics and can sing to all of them...The sharpness of the instruments and vocals breathes a new life (not that they were 'old') and passion into the lyrics...You hear so much more...The show is a feast for the eyes and I found myself smiling/crying silently because of the feeling it gave as well as certain parts taking my breath away...even now, just hearing a Beatles song on the radio (I have XM) you notice mroe and appreciate the simplicity of their music and lyrics, yet they are not simplisitc at all...John and George (who planted the Cirque seed...) would have been so proud and would have approved completely of the 'newfound' music and interpretation of Cirque...Buy the CD - it flows superbly and ages well like a fine wine...And if you get the chance, go to Las Vegas and see the show...There are no bad seats and feel what this music can do to you...BTW...I was born in 1965 and BARELY remember the Beatles in their hayday (just glimpses as a child from the radio...), but can utterly appreciate what they have given to the world...
B000MR9D5E|4.0|It's so nice that a series can sum up the very essence of life - our planet. The series is visually stunning and what you get to see is quite rare.  The only comment that might take away from the series is that it seems to focus a little too much on animals hunting and killing other animals. Other than that, it's great viewing.  Cheers - to Planet Earth!
074356619X|2.0|I would have disliked this product a lot less if I didn't think it had an important kernel of truth. The more we ask what human beings *are* and the more we refuse to rest on an easy answer, the more the question points back to consciousness itself and clamors to get a handle on what exactly lies with it and behind it. It's a fascinating question, and progress towards answering it is closer than anything I've yet encountered to affirming the old maxim that \\"the truth will set you free.\\" So it would that reminding people that they really are something *other* than their circumstances couldn't but be a worthy task.     So what's so wrong with this thing?    The funniest thing about listening to this was that I happened to be sketching a cartoony caricature of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (a German idealist who saw the universe as a projection of the ego. A rather uncanny looking guy) while listening to the first half. Schelling ended up saying a lot of similar things, though in a manner obviously very different from Byrne's. If my caricature did Schelling poor justice, Byrne's treatment might have been more akin to a slap on the face.    If one is primarily a showman and a salesman then an appeal to the emotions will likely get one farther than an appeal to reason alone, this is nothing new. But the logical gaffs in this program are so egregious that I had very nearly to shut off that part of my mind just to get through it; if reason indeed has any role in this recording at all, it is very low, and this is quite ironic in a program that asserts that \\"thoughts are things.\\"      Byrne's appeal is to the emotions almost exclusively, and the appeal here is highly manipulative. Like a 4 disc long infomercial filled with the over-enthused voices of \\"experts,\\" it simply *feels* somehow underhanded.    Now I can't with honesty whether Byrne's intentions were genuine or not, I simply don't know. Perhaps she was so moved by her own experience that she came to think that artful persuasion was the best way to disseminate it. But what insight Rhonda Byrne had to offer has been cheapened by a sizable bounty of underdeveloped (but no less forcefully asserted) \\"blame the victim\\" ethics and a lot of murky and unnecessary new-age mumbo jumbo.    It isn't that the main thrust of the message given here doesn't have its good parts (the first half made me smile a good bit), but it comes with a lot of muck, and in the end the idea is huckstered in a very glib, smarmy, and, at times, cruel way. Another reviewer has mentioned that it also undermines the importance of action and the discipline that goes along with it. In light of everything else, this final indiscretion is difficult to overlook.    People with more experience with self-help materials will probably be able to point you in a better direction. Tony Robbins, for instance, has always said the same stuff, has always said it better, and the problems with his personal philosophy have not been as obviously grim. I don't doubt that there are plenty of other good teachers out there.
B000PY52EU|5.0|I though the movie was very good. Samuel L Jackson played kind of a diffrent part then he normly plays but I think he did a very good  job of it. Christina Ricci I think was just as well. The plot was diffrent and interesting and worth watching. D OBrien.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I grew up on the Disney movies, ranging from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to the Lion King. While both earn my utmost respect, there has always been one that stuck with me in both heart and memory- Beauty and the Beast.        You see, I'm 19 now, almost 20 and this is one movie I've always cherished since childhood. When the narration begins about the Prince,goes to the title, and on, the movie hooks me into a realm of fantasy and romance.         While I'm not too big on romance stories in book form, Disney does it right in this film. A raging, yet sorrow-filled beast who secretly falls in love with a strong-willed woman. First off, they don't like each other, but the relationship blossoms and grows up to where they fight for each other- this is true love in its purest form.        I admit with pride, that I cry at certain scenes, mostly the Transformation scene at the end of the film. The music is lively, the acting is superb, and the memories that remain in my heart  are fond.         Parents, please, please, PLEASE show this film to your children- I firmly believe that they, like myself and many others will fall in love with this film, and many other Disney classics. I give Beauty and the Beast 10 out of 10 Stars. This is my favorite film of all eternity. EVER.

0375760067|4.0|Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.<br /><br />Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.<br /><br />I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.<br /><br />I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.<br /><br />I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.<br /><br />Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.<br /><br />There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride.

0312323867|4.0|I read Something Borrowed and was a bit hesitant to read Something Blue because I couldn't imagine reading an entire book about that annoying, self-centered Darcy!  However, I caved in and I am so glad I did.  This book was wonderful!  I couldn't put it down.  Emily Giffin takes her time with the story and provides a lot of detail and insight into each character, which makes the reader feel that much more invested in the outcome... and what an outcome!  I just wish there was another installment in the Darcy and Rachel series to look forward to.  I usually find most books boring so for me to take the time to write this review says a lot about this book.  I highly recommend.

0385751060|1.0|The plot and themes of this book are unbelievable.  There is no way the son of a high ranking Nazi offical would be confused to \\"baby-talk\\" for terms such as the \\"Fury\\" and \\"out with\\". That sort of naievete would have been unacceptable by such a high ranking family.   And are we to feel sorry and sympathetic for such an immature child, who, while going to visit his friend behind the fence, can't always make it to the visit without eating the morsel he was bring to share?  By the end, we are to feel sorry for the Nazi father when he realizes what happned to \\"his \\" son?  What about the imates at Auschwitz who met excruciating ends at his own hands?   I read this book in anticipation of teaching it in my middle school class.  That won't be happening.
0156027321|5.0|A novel about the art of storytelling and religions. Faith being imaginative and magnificent and lively; a good story. Then a recount and retelling of the same story in a short, faithless, yeastless, and immobile factual manner.   Makes you think, question, reason and answer.  Cant put it down.
1563890410|5.0|As everyone knows who reads his stuff, Gaiman is as original as. In this installment, the Lord of Dreams (one of the Endless, all of whom begin with a \\"D\\") goes to Hell prepared to do battle with Lucifer in order to obtain the release of an ex-lover he condemned there some ten thousand years ago. But Lucifer surprises him by evicting everyone from the underworld, shutting the place down, locking it up tight, and handing the Dreamer the key. What happens in a Creation with no functioning Hell? For one thing, the dead come back (not \\"to life\\" -- just back). For another, a great many deities from an assortment of pantheons, not to mention the evicted demonic tormentors, want to get their hands on the vacant property for their own reasons. As I said: Extremely original. And very well worked out, too. Another strong hit from a true Big Leaguer.
B000002IO1|1.0|This Alan Mills is awful. He can't even pronounce \\"mistress\\", which he sings as \\"misteress\\". The lyrics are banal to the point that they might have been generated by one of those lyric generator things. The only classic is \\"Dark Side of Me\\", which is searing and great. Sorry, that's a lie. It's rubbish, too. Don't give up the day job, Al.
B00005ASOI|2.0|This old scare flick is simply not scarry these days. The version I saw was not subtitled  and the dubbing was awful--both in Italian as well as English. Sound was uneven.    Italian filmmakers seem to think this is acceptable. Well, guess what, folks? It's a headache for the  viewer.  The writing is as unimpressive as the direction. Argento has done much better elsewhere. Take a look  at that thing he did with Keitel. Harvey is terrific in it--and so is the film (with the exception of the uncalled for, nutty flashback sequence.)  Sorry, can't think of the title. Might be called The Black Cat. Not sure. Harvey plays a photographer in it.
B000R4SMCW|1.0|I saw this movie whilst it was in theaters with high expectations.  It has been a LONG time since I have fallen asleep at a movie in a theater, but this one managed to do it.  I had to use the restroom (and I hardly ever use the restroom at the theater) and I missed the one exciting part the film had to offer, and even that part went unexplained.    Anthony Hopkins, shame on you.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is a wonderful bit of blues history. I take my hat off to KWS for taking a back seat to these blues legends.

It is one of the best.
0385338902|5.0|I read \\"The Book of Joe\\" and \\"Everything Changes\\" and loved both of them; I think this one is Jonathan Tropper's best yet.     His description of Doug's emotions over the loss of his wife is excellent... I knew exactly what he was feeling.    I also very much enjoyed Doug's relationship with Russ, and the way it developed throughout the story... There were parts that had me laughing out loud (Russ and Doug in the grocery store in particular!)    If you are looking for a fun summer read that also has depth and makes you think, pick this up!
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story.  It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma.  Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence.  For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true.  Wonderful movie.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Oliver Stone's JFK is an exceptional film. It is probably the most complicated film ever made. The density is overwelming at times. The multitude of characters and events make the film require many, many viewings. For this edition, Oliver Stone included tons of extra scenes and sequences. The additional footage of Donald Sutherland's sequence and the court room sequence add enlightening information and drama. Stone's commentary is also amazing. The documentary is wonderfully fascinating. This is Oliver Stone's \\"Godfather\\" and I truly think JFK is one of the best films ever made.

0060763892|4.0|What happened to the lost fleet of Italian adventurer Marco Polo on his return from half a lifetime spent in the presence of the Great Khan of China?    From the dark depths of the Indian Ocean, a bacterial bloom is rising. Cynobacteria are rising to the surface in a phosphorescent glow and destroying all life in the water and on the shores of the pristine tropical paradise of Christmas Island.    Scientists Susan and Gregg Tunis, conducting research off the coast of the tiny island, are horrified when the glowing sea erupts and envelopes their boat, making them the first human victims infected by the bacteria.    In Italy an obscure Egyptian obelisk is stolen. The cryptograms on its facings are said to written in the language of angels. A pair of shadowy figures are present at the rendezvous to exchange the obelisk--both seeking it, but unwilling to share.    In Maryland Commander Gray Pierce, of the ultra secret SIGMA force--a clandestine unit of the United States Government made up of former Special Forces operators turned doctoral scientists--is taking a break, enjoying the company of his mother and enduring his father's deteriorating health.    When a motorcyclist crashes in his front yard, Gray recognizes the woman with the bullet wound from a previous encounter with forces from SIGMA's nemesis, The Guild. When Pierce finds the aforementioned Egyptian obelisk beside the woman's motionless body, this story goes from zero to sixty in a few short pages.    While SIGMA specialists are sent to investigate the bacterial crisis, Pierce and his family become hunted targets of a new Guild assassin known only as Nassar.    James Rollins does not disappoint in his latest thriller that stars your favorite SIGMA characters. Once again we're treated to the extensive research we have come to expect, and though some aspects are merely educated conjecture, they are persuasively plausible. Follow Pierce and a team made up of former friends and former enemies as they track the clues left by Marco Polo to the source of the bacteriological epidemic threatening to sweep the world in a plague that will make the Black Plague resemble a flu outbreak.    Armchair Interviews says: This book is sure to push aside the competition as the best of the summer thrillers this year!
0131103628|4.0|Seeing as this is written by the guy who invented C, you cant go wrong when it comes to accuracy and information here. Overall, the book sets a good pace, and explains all the concepts quite well. However, there are some leaps in logic, and having the help of a somewhat \\"easier\\" book will help readers without a background in science/logic/math/whatever. Something along the lines of the \\"for Dummies\\" books would be an example. Even so, the chapters make sense, and everything is explained well, but good luck doing the sample problems based upon what you learned in the chapters without the aid of a secondary source.
1932100660|5.0|I read this book after reading Dr. Esselstyn's book, and I am convinced now that this research will probably lengthen my life considerably.  Although I can see that there is a highly vocal group that seems to take personal affront that someone would dare suggest that our typical American diet is not healthy, I knew after reading these books that I had to try a new way of eating.  Almost five months ago now, I was having all of the problems that seem to plague so many Americans in middle age.  I am a 47 year old male, and I was eating the typical American diet for the most part.  I had tried the zone, tried minimizing calories at various times, and nothing really worked.  I'd yo-yo back and forth, and in the meantime I developed high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and rising cholesterol.  I was on medicine for blood pressure, low hdl, and reflux, costing me over $100 a month even on excellent insurance.  I was pushing 225lbs, suffered from worsening back problems, and was generally fearful that I'd probably follow my father's fate of an early fatal MI.   Life insurance cost me 4 times what it cost my wife.  The actuaries didn't seem to have much faith in me sticking around.  That was 5 months ago.    After reading Esselstyn's book, and getting over the initial frustration as to why my Doctor hadn't told me any of this, I decided to give it a try.  I cut out all animal products, dairy, refined products, and all added oils.  I went with Esselstyn's recommendations 100% from day one.  After reading the China Study, I was even more motivated to stick with it.    For me, the proof is right there in front of me, or rather where my gut used to be.  I have lost almost 30 pounds, I am off my blood pressure, cholesterol, and reflux meds, and even my back feels better.  I've done this without any increase in exercise, and I eat constantly, and as much as I want, as long as it's not animal based or with added oils of any kind.    To me, the argument is over, and I'm never going back.  Yes, I take vitamins to avoid B12 deficiency, and yes, it's a pain sometimes when going to restaurants, but with a young daughter, I have all the motivation I need to stick with this for life.  If my doctor had a pill that could have done all these things for me, I'm sure it would be the drug of all time.  Fortunately, I didn't have to wait for that pipedream, and I thank Dr's Campbell and Esselstyn every day now for what they've done for me.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|Although I'm not French or can even speak French, I've been a fan of Celine's French music ever since Deux/The French Album (and of course her prior recordings). Of course since it is her native tongue, you can hear how she really puts alot of emotion and feeling into what she's singing and you \\"get more\\" of Celine when she is singing in French.      Her Deux album is argubly her most strongest French album, with the wonderful 1st time collaboration with Jean Jacques Goldman. In it she is powerful, young..totally Celine. In Sil Suffisait D'aimer, again she is working with Goldman, but there are deeper messages, more introspective a little more serious (you can even see it in the pictures on her album), but still beautiful music, somewhat masculine, and you really start to hear new ranges in her voice, and of course what I love...her little harmonies and melodies she makes when she's not singing words. In 1 Fille and 4 Types, she is more laid back and inspired truly by the desert and country music. Great music again, a little more masculine, a little more rock. In her compilation On Ne Change Pas, again classic Celine..great powerful songs and her career song Je Ne Vous Oublie Pas      In D'Elles, she is totally in her feminine perspective/voice (as evident the title), and it's more dramatic, almost as if the entire album is a soap opera or dramatic film. Sweeping music, high drama (1st two songs), tender words, the kind of music you would imagine with a wide shot of a heroine in the middle of a golden field on the top of a mountain with the wind blowing through her hair and dress and the sunset in the background (ala Belle in Beauty and the Beast).    It's beautiful music once again, and it kinda shows Celine trying different themes, and growing as a singer. Although she is always in control of her voice, she sounds like she sings with much more freedom and less restraint, less direction. She's intepreting what she feels through the different female song writers, and it seems no one is telling her how to sing the songs, she's going with her feelings. I think Celine has always wanted to be free with her music, and D'Elles seems to be her step towards that.    D'Elles is also a tribute and celebration of the female writers, authors, poets who's songs appear on the album...so if anything this is not only about Celine... this CD is truly worth it.
B000803CU2|5.0|The first three tracks form an electrifying sequence: from the pulsating 1999 through the rocking Little Red Corvette and into the hypnotic Delirious. The disturbingly prophetic words of 1999 gave me the chills but Little Red Corvette soon cured that, and halfway through the uplifting Delirious I was enraptured! This is a powerhouse song sequence, on a par with Donna Summer's legendary sequence of The Midnight Shift/Queen For A Day/Now I Need You on the original vinyl of her album [[ASIN:B000001FEE Once Upon a Time]].<br /><br />Because of such gems, one tends to overlooked the fact that tracks like Let's Pretend We're Married and DMSR are brilliant too. Automatic is a long atmospheric piece with lovely female vocal and an impressive instrumental ending. Free is compelling in the interplay between Prince's falsetto and the backing vocals, another song loaded with meaning: \\"Be glad that U are free, free to change your mind/Free to go most anywhere anytime/Be glad that U are free, there's many a man who's not/So don't sleep until your guilty, cause sinners all are we.\\" It's pure gospel, and a rousing number too.<br /><br />Prince's music is such a seamless blend of so many styles, that it's hard to single out particular influences. But to me, on this album he's like a more urgent and full-bodied Chic! There's that same elegant tension in the beat, but Prince has eschewed Chic's minimalism for the full power of Rock and R&B. This is very noticeable on the bouncy Lady Cab Driver, but elsewhere too. Putting styles aside, 1999 is spectacular by any measure. The melodies, arrangements, lyrics, the playing and his voice all are superb, and the mix sets new standards in sonic perfection. I lost track of Prince's career after the 1980s but listening to this album again was pure joy.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|What's not to love about Norah?  She once again gives us super music on this cd. Can't think of anything bad to say about it.
B000AM6OKS|5.0|The theme of this somber 1971 album is drugs and the aural administration thereof takes place mostly via slow, soulful songs. The three up-tempo exceptions are the raucous Brown Sugar, the malevolent Bitch and the extended jamming excursion Can't You Hear Me Knocking, all prime slabs of powerful rock `n roll.<br /><br />The down-tempo tracks all have an air of melancholia about them, from the world-weary Wild Horses to the unoriginally titled but moving I Got the Blues. The notorious Sister Morphine, also performed by Marianne Faithfull on albums like [[ASIN:B000001FVB Blazing Away]] and [[ASIN:B000003BEP Greatest Hits]], is a decadent and chilling highlight.<br /><br />The country-tinged Dead Flowers is another masterpiece with evocative imagery and addictive melody line and reminds me somewhat of Far Away Eyes on their [[ASIN:B000000W5P Some Girls]] (1978) album. Sticky Fingers concludes with the yearning Moonlight Mile, a final unforgettable song. The blend of butt-kicking rock and brooding ballads ensure a perfect Stones album.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|The follow-up to Buble's last effort, the terrific CD/DVD, which featured his wonderful self-penned song, \\"Home,\\" may not have some of the energy and verve of that set (and that incredible concert), but this is STILL a fine collection of songs, with several standouts: \\"Everything,\\" another of Buble's own compositions is upbeat, fun, and swinging (even if some of the lyrics are a bit weak); \\"I've Got the World on a String,\\" which features members of the band calling out his name, is another winner, and beautifully arranged; \\"Wonderful Tonight,\\" works perfectly as a Latin tinged duet, which will remind some of Sinatra's work with Antonio Carlos Jobim; and \\"Dream,\\" which concludes the CD, might be something you'll hear on a late night jazz station and LOVE. The CD is somewhat uneven - I'm not sure we need another version of \\"Always on My Mind,\\" but it's still well done. \\"Lost,\\" another Buble composition, doesn't really build well as a song, and \\"That's Life\\" doesn't work nearly as well as the great Sinatra original. BUT - there's no doubt this man is a talented singer, who can clearly sing in a variety of styles (if you've seen him in concert, imitating Michael Jackson and others, you'll know he's capable of continued excellence in his singing, phrasing, and song selection).  I'd love to hear him do a version of \\"Alfie,\\" for instance, to sing more of his own upbeat compositions, and collaborate more with some great female singers, but THIS work, though not a completely satisfying CD, is still VERY good and worth purchasing. Many of the songs catch up to you, as Buble, singing without apparent enhancement, allows his voice to be a little rawer than in his debut album. He sounds real and true - and his band, as always, is beyond first rate. They are completely in synch, as they are in their concerts.  I think, to quote one of the songs on this fine CD, \\"The Best is Yet To Come,\\" holds true for this great entertainer. He seems sure to produce some kind of concept album, along the lines of \\"In the Wee Small Hours,\\" ala Sinatra - and I think he can pick better material in some places.  But his voice, his band, some of the fine songs, especially his own hit tune, \\"Everything,\\" make this a MUST for fans.  Bubleland is STILL a fine place to be!  And the man is building a terrific body of work.long the lines of \\"In the Wee Small Hours,\\" ala Sinatra - and I think he can pick better material in some places.

B00005GOEJ|5.0|Although the Stones made a mediocre album or two in this period 1971 - 1993, it's probably my favorite era in their career. I mean, who can dispute that Start Me Up was one of the most classic rock songs of the 1980s? Or that [[ASIN:B000000W5N Sticky Fingers]] was one of the most brilliant albums of the 1970s?<br /><br />This hits collection is not arranged chronologically but it contains masterpieces like the raucous and controversial Brown Sugar and the bluesy Wild Horses from 1971, the Las Vegas-inpired Tumbling Dice of the next year, the aching ballad Angie from 1973 and the anti-journalistic dig It's Only Rock 'n Roll, recorded in 1974 after they got some bad press.<br /><br />Later the band moved to a more groovy sound with Hot Stuff, ladled out emotion on Fool To Cry and made a nod in the direction of disco with the entrancing Miss You. What I miss here is the weird country song Far Away Eyes from the same album. There's also Emotional Rescue, sung in Jagger's famous falsetto. Everybody knows the gripping ballads Waiting On A Friend from 1981 and Undercover Of The Night from '83.<br /><br />Another sad omission, this time from the [[ASIN:B000000W64 Steel Wheels]] album is the wonderful ballad Blinded By Love, although Rock And A Hard Place was also a good choice. In the 1960s they reinterpreted the blues and created incredible psychedelic rock. The above period saw them taking different directions again, everyone a winner. Jump Back is a brilliant showcase of the greatest band in the world's fertile middle period.
B000PY52EU|3.0|Don't be fooled by the Russ Meyer sexploitation feel to the cover and the marketing...  It ain't about that ....this is a great movie about 2 people with 2 different issues, and how they work it out....together....with her in chains...    Great Blues music....    Don't be fooled by the first 30 minutes (lots of trailer trash feel). This is a good movie...regardless of  how it did in the theatres...
0783240236|5.0|Melanie Daniels is the Paris Hilton of her day, she has a wealthy father and often finds herself, or did find herself a regular in the tabloids. After some games Melanie is in hot pursuit in her convertible screeching her tires along, accompanied by two love birds who sway back and forth as she races to Bodega Bay to surprise lawyer Mitch Brenner with said birds.<br />Mitch's mom is afraid she'll be abandoned and sees sexy Melanie as a threat to steal her boy. Ever since her husband died she isn't much of a mom to Mitch or his 20 year younger sister Cathy, Melanie herself was abandoned by her mom yet the only mother we need to concern ourselves with in this film is mother nature.<br />Alfred Hitchcock actually makes sweet little birds scary, I've seen his greats Vertigo, Psycho, Rear Window, Nororious, and Strangers on a train and I did not expect The Birds to be as freaky as it was. Nearing the end we begin to really like Melanie, she isn't the Paris type at all she's just misunderstood. She is warm, kind and beautiful and Cathy really likes her and Mitch's mom is starting to come around, Oh no!, so do The Birds!!  As she ascends the eerie staircase to investigate the noise, and finds herself trapped in a room paralyzed with panic and fear unable to scream as the birds peck at her entire body is this it for Melanie? Watch and see mu ha ha ha.<br />Hitchcock's concept is interesting as our bird expert points out earlier in the film.  In our world there are 100 billion birds, another reminder of how nature can dwarf us. We find our friends Melanie and the Brenner Family ultimately locked up in their house by birds in a role reversal where the humans are in the cage and are scarred and confused and are never given a reason why.<br /><br />The Masterpiece Collection<br />**DVD** The technicolor was great and the picture quality good even strechted on a 106\\" screen. The sound was dolby digital 2 channel would've been nice to get a 5.1 track hearing the birds swooping infrom all angles.<br />This is a definite add to any collection and I would recommend.<br /><br />** The Birds is also # 96 on Bravo Channels Scariest movie moments list of 100 ** Also received 1 oscar nomination for best effects in 1964 **

B000001GQB|5.0|In the WHOLE recorded field of Mozart late symphonies, NONE shine like these. Karl Bohm, undoubtedly, ranks supreme as the finest Mozart interpreter of \\"our\\" generation. He simply KNEW, and HAD A WAY, with this music that remains unparalleled. And the Berlin, well, they, too, certainly can work their way through these scores like no other ensemble...likely because of the great master leading them here.<br /><br />I originally had these on LP back in the 60's, and literally wore the set out, replacing it years later. Then, of course, with it's initial release on cd I repurchased it, but found it \\"shrill\\" to my ears. This new remastering is simply stunning, and first rate. Thanks DG (or Universal) for your loving care and attention in this re-release mastering.<br /><br />Simply stated, this set of the final symphonies of Mozart, under Bohm, BELONG in EVERY COLLECTION as a cornerstone. Should you doubt me, please read on among the other reviews here, and be convinced. ~operabruin
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I pulled this series out and asked if my wife wanted to watch it with me she was compromising. She HATES science fiction. We watched the first episode, Serenity, and she thought it was pretty good. After another episode she was hooked. She wouldn't let me go to bed; she wanted to watch another episode! We finished the whole series and the movie, Serenity, within one week. We were both so overwhelmed at how good the show was and completely puzzled at how it could have been cancelled after such a short run.<br /><br />As I said, my wife hates science fiction, but she thought this was one of the best television shows she's seen...ever. And I'd have to agree with her.<br /><br />I just wish we could see more from this show. It was very sad to watch the last episode and know it was done forever.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Well, I guess it's now out! Now the whole world will know what I think of Jaws!<br /><br />I remember the night Jaws opened, going to my local theater, and standing in line (but, back then, the lines weren't like they are now!), putting up my $3, and not completely knowing what to expect, sitting quietly waiting for the movie to start. It did, and of course, the next thing I knew, I was on this unbelieveably heart-pounding, nerve wracking, and terrifying \\"ride\\" that I could not get off!<br /><br />It TRULY was/is the most terrifying movie I ever saw! I remember after it was over, just sitting in my seat and not moving for long after everyone else had left the theater...I just did not have the strength? energy? whatever, to rise and leave the theater, I just sat there. (this also happened after Easy Rider and Bonnie and Clyde, but for shock-value at their endings, and with Field of Dreams because of the subject matter touching me so very deeply).<br /><br />Now, I have not seen this particular DVD release of Jaws (one simply cannot keep re-buying these things), but I do own the last special edition of it. I would say that if you do not own the prior one, by all means go for this one. Regardless which edition you buy, of course, you are in for the most terrifying scare any movie can throw at you! It's funny, but after seeing this movie for (how many times) all these years, I still keep hoping that Robert Shaw is NOT going to go down the throat of the Great White, every single time!!! What a great, sorrowfully underrated, actor he was!<br /><br />So, pick it up, take it home and pop it in your player, and sit on your hands so you don't chew your nails down to the knuckles! ~operabruin
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Today you may find this songs \\"ridicule\\" because of their \\"middle class burgoisise\\" context, but back in 1977, they sounded fresh and optimistic.  And that is how I remember them: the atmosphere of the small sea-towns, an aura of Casablanca movie in the title song,voice of Al Stewart that sounds like one of a spoiled, honest child, hungry for excitement, nice girls and harmless \\"noir\\" adventures.   Today,it still sounds just the same; perfect for beach-caffe s with margaritas and a sunset. White mornings after the one-night stands with satin-ladies, gauloise before entering the exotic marketplaces in Maroco or Spain. Good for people over 35, or maybe younger romantics.   Not for hip-hop lovers.   Brilliant production,fresh as it was decades ago.
B000006NPY|1.0|I am a big pumpkins fan, but let's face it, this is not a good CD. The only catchy songs are Ava Adore and Daphne Descends, and maybe Perfect.  other than that, all the songs sound the same, too electronic and uncreative, and pretty much a Billy Corgan solo album.  I do not consider it a Pumpkins album for the reason that Billy Corgan is the only member of the new SP line up that participated on the album.  I consider Zeitgeist a Pumpkins album because the two core original members of the band created it.  D'arcy and James Iha are a dime a dozen, and hardly participated in the recording process, only Jimmy and Billy.    This album is not good, and the terrible sales prove it.

It is also a great pleasue to watch all of the 4 leading ladies. They are unbeliable! Especially Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy.

1594489505|3.0|The book was very well written and character development was extremely well done.  However, I did not particularly enjoy the mixture of a \\"story\\" set amidst a documentary type of book.  I would rather have been prepared to read about the violence/brutality/subjugation of the women in a documentary type of setting so as to understand the situation under which those women live and try to survive. I found this book extremely depressing and was amazed that this kind of life is being lived now - today, not years and years ago when women were suppressed, beaten and had absolutely no rights. This story takes place now and it is very disturbing.

B000002KAT|5.0|Moondance has always been one of my favorite CDs. Why it took me so long to buy Astral Weeks I'll never know. I can't stop listening to this album (and I've had it for almost a year now). I think it's one of the most honest albums I've ever heard. Van puts his all into every single line. Later on in his career it's almost like he stopped caring and just \\"talks\\" through the lines live. Here there is actual emotion and it's so precisely captured that every song takes you to a place that you feel like you've been before. The liner notes mention that there are no noticeable \\"singles\\" here, but I think every song works great in the context of the work as a whole and also stands on it's own admirably. This is in my top ten.

Set in Afghanistan, the reader is drawn into the lives of the women who live there. Any women who has felt even the merest pressure of a male foot on her neck, will immediately identify with this novels searing truths.<br /><br />The book opens in pre-Soviet Afghanistan. We find Miriam, a young 15 year old girl, living with her Nana, in the outskirts of Herat. Nana is her mother, an unwed mother, who has a bitter cynical view of life. Though she loves Miriam, her fear, hurt and shame color her interactions with the child.<br /><br />Miriam's father Jalil, pays weekly visits to his daughter, bringing news and treats.

But after 7 miscarriages, he begins treating her like garbage, brutally abusive and cold. Nothing Miriam does pleases him, not her deference, her cooking, nor her attempts to include herself in his interests. One night, after taking a bite of the rice she now dreads cooking, he erupts into a rage.

B000OYC3J8|4.0|You gotta love 'em! Nobody else sings the rock'n blues anymore like Jack while Meg pounds those drums like nobody else I have ever heard. She is a precision drum machine don't ya know. Almost mechanical.   Also as a Led Zep fan I always hear their influence and love it. Jack also has a touch of Bjork in his voice at times & is equally as quirky & theatrical to boot.   You won't be disappointed if you love the WS. Another fun loving & bizarre CD with some international flavor (Tijuana brass or Scottish bagpipes) added to the mix.

0156027321|3.0|The narrator says this story will make you believe in God.  It does not.  But it does make you believe in the power in fiction.  What a great story!  But it's as if Martel had to apologize for writing a fable, and tried to be more \\"hip\\" by adding the question about God, and the depressing ending which forces you to think about the role of fiction in our lives.  But the ending does not cause us to think about God, like it claims.
0385333846|5.0|Well-read in the Vonnegut oeuvre, I somehow had missed SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE and, put in the mood for an anti-war book by the relentless news from Iraq, I remedied that this week.  Unfortunately, readers the world over recently lost Kurt Vonnegut (and so it goes); reading this book makes me miss him more than ever.<br /><br />What's most amazing is how the book slides through time and space effortlessly and without distracting the reader.  No one's about to condemn it for its \\"episodic\\" nature, in other words.  Beyond Billy Pilgrim, there are no important characters... just this looming presence of unstoppable, unexplainable, unethical authority.  That can be government, the military, or a single person (a whole cavalcade of them come and go in Billy's life).  For instance, how powerful is it that few Americans -- even among the most educated -- realize that the bombing of Dresden, Germany, killed more people than the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan.  The German civilians were torched with \\"conventional\\" weapons.  The Japanese, of course, with an atomic bomb (\\"unconventional\\" weaponry?).<br /><br />And so it goes.<br /><br />Included in this classic-for-a-reason anti-war book is the high arc of Vonnegut's signature humor and creativity.  Billy Pilgrim is kidnapped by extraterrestrials from Tralfamadore.  They know a thing or two about life (it goes on) and death (it doesn't).  Somehow the mix of horrifying history, science fiction, and pitifully funny (humorously pitiful?) morality tale come together like a symphonic orchestra made up of disparate parts.  Only Vonnegut, it would seem, could pull it off.<br /><br />Inspired by World War II, given momentum by Vietnam, and kept aflame by Iraq, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE will never lose relevance because it hinges on the absurdity that is man and his addiction to power and war. Like Billy Pilgrim, it will slide through time and space effortlessly and forever.
1400032717|4.0|When you pass through the mirror of irony, you get oddness often unaware of itself, sometimes pitiful, sometimes brilliant and unique.  So although this novel is told from an autistic's point of view, I think it is more an allegory for ourselves, in this reality TV, internet age.  Borat, and Little Miss Sunshine are dealing with this same problem -- of each and every one of us being an example of unwitting dramatic irony -- in different ways.    This is a very good novel, a mystery novel, an insightful novel, one of personal triumph, a compassionate one, and a funny one.  Will it last through the ages?  Probably not, but still for this age, it's quite good.
B000NA2776|5.0|Mika has brought us one of the most fun CDs that I've seen in a few years. Yes, he sounds like Freddie Mercury at times, but he's got a style of his own.     If you've heard Grace Kelly, you should have a good idea of what Mika is all about. It's fun, high-pitched pop. If you're turned off by his falsetto, stay away from this album.    There are a couple not-so-good songs on this album at the end (I don't even remember their names because I skip over them), but other than that, every song will get stuck in your head for days. I highly recommend this!

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This movie is to truth as oil is to water.  Al gives one heck of a strong sermon, but as a scientist is a complete flop.  He offers anecdotal evidence aplenty that the world is warming-- but it's not proof.  He offers no compelling evidence that CO2 is causing this warming and, in fact, the only evidence he DOES offer on that shows exactly the opposite-- that global warming causes CO2.  Finally, he offers no evidence at all that humans are creating the CO2 increase in an amount equal to the problem.  Finally, he says that we only have ten years to save the planet.  Considering he started saying that nine years ago, I think we should just ignore him and try to live with it.  We're doing pretty well so far.
B000J103PC|3.0|There's good news and bad news about The Devil Wears Prada.  Since this Season In Hell everyone who's anyone will be wearing hobnail boots, lets start with the bad news.  This movie is awful, even as a chick-flick guilty pleasure it's awful.  The plot is hackneyed to the point of exhaustion, the ending is glib and facile, the characters are so two dimensional that when they turn sideways all you can see is the label, and the engine driving the alleged action - the scary power of Miranda Priestly - emanates from her ability to determine what color sweater the likes of us will be wearing next year.  In sum - it's the fashion industry folks - it doesn't matter - compared to this world cotton candy looks substantial.<br /><br />Now the good news.  Anne Hathaway is adorable as Andy Sachs, and makes her ridiculous role believable - she sells it.  She's as appealing in jeans as she is in couture.  Stanley Tucci is perfect - perfect - as Nigel.  I have never seen Tucci turn in a bad performance - he is absolutely amazing.  The role would have been easy to send over the top but Tucci nails it with restraint and class, fantastic.<br /><br />Of course the showcase here is Meryl Streep - and honestly - although it's heresy - I've never cared much for her work.  Sadly her role is not even two-dimensional, it's almost one-dimensional - but she carries it off so well that you just don't care.  It's a hoot watching her, and she's obviously having a ball.  As you might imagine, it's a visually pleasing movie, the fashion plates just keep passing by, which is fun.  Male characters fare badly, Andy's boyfriend is a waste of atoms and her bad boy love interest is completely unconvincing as a straight male putting the moves on a woman.  Special bonus points to Emily Blunt who turns in an outstanding performance as Priestly's assistant Emily - she perfectly embodies the neurotic cattiness and one-upsmanship of the industry.<br /><br />To be found at the back of the store with the other distressed goods, on the rack; the torture rack.rack; the torture rack.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Really enjoyed this release. She can burn like Melissa at times, fall back on senstive sounds like Kathleen Edwards when she wants.  There are influences from 60s rock (Elton, Beatles, Mott), yet her distinct warble blossoms as a wildwood flower.  I'm gonna find her debut CD.<br /><br />If you gravitate toward other female singer-songwriter greats in league with Sarah Harmer, Alice Peacock or Jessica Sykes, this should work for you.<br /><br />Indigo Girls guest on \\"Cannonball\\"<br /><br />As far as great CDs of the last  couple of years go, this one ranks right up there with Allison Moorer's Neil Young inspired \\"The Duel\\" (hey if the Crazy Horse-shoe fits, wear it) and Patty Griffin's homage to the good ol' days,\\"Impossible Dream\\". Lofty company to be sure.
0618526412|3.0|I read this book, originally, because it was one of James Dean's favorites.  A gift he gave to William Bast in New York before he left for Hollywood to shoot \\"East of Eden.\\"  There was something substantially lonely about all the characters in the book that Dean must have connected with, himself an enigmatic, and very lonely figure.  Albeit, one surrounded by people.    Upon reading the novel myself, I found it interesting how each of the four main characters created exactly what they needed, emotionally, in the deaf mute character of Singer.  To me, he seemed the loneliest of them all...always without.  No way of communicating, only listening.  No way of expression.  This is what I think Dean connected with...no way of expressing the loneliness.  Bast's biography, \\"Surviving James Dean,\\" gives an excellent depiction of a James Dean closed off from the rest of world...a Dean stuck in a deaf mute's world, with no way to express his tumultuous feelings.    Carson McCullers does a great job of portraying some bohemian American ideals far before their time: racism, capitalism, arguments in communism.  A true American novelist, there is something distincly \\"American\\" about the young woman from Columbus, Georgia, something that depicts excellently the prudent struggles of Americans that are vastly different than any other civilization.
B000065PUE|3.0|Doolittle is almost universally revered as the godhead of the Pixies, but I can't for the life of me understand it.  Instead of a fully realized work, Doolittle is instead an incredibly promising work of a band that just hasn't matured yet.  The Pixies would go on to produce their masterpiece in Bossanova.  Trompe le Monde is also far superior.    Doolittle does have one truly fantastic song -- \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven,\\" which is a gift.  And it has a few good to very good ones, like \\"Here Comes Your Man,\\" \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" and (depending on my mood) \\"Debaser.\\"  But many of these songs (even Debaser) would qualify as filler to people who aren't caught up in the hype.  \\"Lala Love You,\\" for instance, is just some random noodling -- not a song at all -- with Frank Black trying his hardest to create some vocal interest with every whacked out sound at his disposal.  Unfortunately, it -- like a lot of the other non-songs here -- comes off as just a little too cute.      If you're new to the Pixies, I strongly recommmend starting with the amazing Bossanova instead.  If you're not new to the Pixies, you already own them all, so it really doesn't matter.  Any way you look at it, the Pixies were a major force in modern music.  This just ain't the best evidence of that.
B00064WSNW|5.0|Some seven years after Robert Fripp declared King Crimson dead post &#34;[[ASIN:B00065MDSQ Red]],&#34; there was much surprise in the music world when he re-appeared not only with a four-piece rock band, but slapping the name King Crimson upon it. Just to make sure it would get the intellectual ears to ponder it, he gave it the academic and spiritually highbrow moniker &#34;Discipline.&#34; Because as anyone worth their prog-rock smarts would tell you, playing good highbrow rock required it.<br /><br />But what shook a lot of people at the time was how the usually reserved Fripp gave the front mic to Adrian Belew, whose more light-hearted (read &#34;American&#34;) persona was so different from Fripp's. Add old KC alum Bill Bruford and US Bass/chapman stick wiz Tony Levin and you had a clash of continents that made for perfect chemistry. Fripp's mathematical guitar &#34;fripperies&#34; balance Belew's animal noises with impeccable beauty and more that a dash of humor. The two cuts to gather the airplay, &#34;Elephant Talk&#34; and &#34;Thela Hun Ginjeet,&#34; seemed to favor Belew, who obviously was having a ball barking out the alliterations on &#34;Elephant Talk.&#34; Bringing some of his polyrhythmic skills over from sidelining with Talking Heads, Belew brought the rock to Fripp's highbrow.<br /><br />When the band decided to wax artistic, though, Belew delivered. The lovely &#34;Matte Kudasi&#34; may be one of his finest hours on any album, and the lyric to &#34;Indiscipline&#34; captured the love/hate relationship an artist can have with his words. The final, title track is also terrific fusion rock, the instrumental work that is positively electric. Levin's work on this song in particular and the album overall, probably brought the inventor of The Chapman Stick a whole new clutch of devotees.<br /><br />Fripp may have looked on the new King Crimson as an academic exercise (the new liner notes are often unintentionally funny in their seriousness), but these four virtuosos under Fripp's strict hand held together to make some brilliant music. &#34;Discipline&#34; is best thought of as the high water mark in a trio that includes &#34;[[ASIN:B00065MDT0 Beat]]&#34; and &#34;[[ASIN:B00064WSO6 Three of a Perfect Pair]].&#34; By combining some of the ferocity of new wave (there are hints of Talking Heads and The Police among the songs here), proved that the new line-up of Kind Crimson lived up the legacy of its namesake.t hand held together to make some brilliant music. &#34;Discipline&#34; is best thought of as the high water mark in a trio that includes &#34;[[ASIN:B00065MDT0 Beat]]&#34; and &#34;[[ASIN:B00064WSO6 Three of a Perfect Pair]].&#34; By combining some of the ferocity of new wave (there are hints of Talking Heads and The Police among the songs here), proved that the new line-up of Kind Crimson lived up the legacy of its namesake.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|Anyone who has managed 25 years in the music industry deserves some credit and respect especialy while maintaining integrity and dignity against sometimes impossible odds. Whether you love or hate George, you can't deny that he's done it his way while standing up against the might of the major labels. I am not interested in his  private life but rather to the unique style, vibe and rythum this guy offered to the world for 25 years.<br />Twentyfive is broken down into three discs - the first of which -<br />For Living - is the dancier, more upbeat of the trio.<br />For Loving, the second disc, is more ballady, containing last-slow-dance, from his first solo outings Careless Whisper and several duets ex. (Paul McCartney, Elton John, Pavarotti, Sugababe Mutya, Aretha Franklin, Elton John)<br />And then there's the final disc, For The Loyal, containing B-sides, rarities and curiosities.<br /><br />Overall, a must-have for any George Michael fun!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|One of the best movies ever made for all the reasons so well written by other reviewers. Wouldn't it be wonderful to see this film on the big screen in honor of its 70th anniversary? If it can be done for for \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" why not for a film that is a part of American film history and a joy to watch? I think the studios (including Disney)are missing a great opportunity in not re-releasing films as they once did. I remember seeing GWTW in the late 60s, the first \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy and \\"Grease\\" in the late 90s.  This film is wonderful on DVD, but it would honor all who made it and contemporary audiences to show it again in theaters. Think of all the horrible films in theaters between the Oscars and the summer blockbusters.   Some one at Warners- please!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Does Zodiac have a suspense? I'm not telling you.<br /><br />Thirty minutes into the film, I started wishing I didn't watch it at home and was at the theater. Being a period film (and not just a period film) , Zodiac manages to switch timeline from the 60's to the 70's and holds your attention quite keenly. The dialogues, the acting, the sets, locations, cars and the film's music and overall spirit is hardly underwhelming.<br /><br />Zodiac is the story of a serial killer who loves leaving clues. This is just a mere statement from the film without any over-bearing significance. HOWEVER,  what is most interesting about his manner of killing are the clues he leaves in newspapers, at parking lots, on the bodies of the victims, on greeting cards and on mails addressed to the newspapers and on conversations with victims, police and media.<br /><br />Although it is like Seven, Zodiac is a different Seven of it's own. It's pace doesn't really allow you to judge it, instead it poses in many ways and decorates itself and the sheer energy, enthusiasm and work that has gone behind making this film a success is hearty. Forget all that, take for instance, the scenes involving phone booth sequences, the double questioning of the integrity of each character, the vague semi-conclusions, the way people would sit around T.V waiting for news to unfold, those recorder tapes that remind you of a movie called \\"The Conversation\\" and what not - ensure a great film watching experience.<br /><br />The murders were very enjoyable. You will love the doubt. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the film. People who loved Departed - would like to give Zodiac a chance.<br />This is maybe the best film I have seen in 2007 although I haven't seen too many. You will also fall in love with \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" by Donovan. The song truly reflects the rage this film tries so hard to build up.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, fantastic work. David Fincher, RESPECT!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am really happy that I bought this set.  I was worried when I read that it was narrated by David and it was different from the US version we see on the Discovery Channel.  I bought it anyway and I almost prefer the British version.  The narrator is very informative and is enthusiastic about the topic.  He has an accent, but he is understandable.  This would make an excellent gift.  It comes in a nice box with five discs and each chapter has a written summary.  There are also behind the scene footage so we get to see what it was like for them to film this project.  I am amazed and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
0066620996|5.0|This is one of the best business books that I have ever read. How does a company become a great company? Collins and his team have distilled some important conclusions after an exhaustive investigation of over a thousand companies. Here are the answers:<br /><br />First, it must have a self-effacing but determined leader that works for the glory of the company, not his/her glory. Then it must have the team. This is one of the surprising findings: first the who, then the what. Then it must confront the facts head on. Next it must find its place in this competitive world by putting itself at the intersection the the \\"three circles\\": what are we good at, what are we passionate about and what can we make money at. Incidentally every person should ask herself these simple questions. Picasso and Federer must somehow have done it. Through disciplined thought and action then it starts to turn the \\"flywheel\\" on and on an on by improving continuously. In the process of deciding what to be it is also equally important to decide what NOT to be. No magic, no revolution.<br /><br />Numerous examples of \\"the Great Eleven\\" plus comparison companies that failed to excel or did it briefly illustrate the conclusions.

0385522401|5.0|Ian McEwan is essentially a short story writer....an extremely wonderful short story writer.  Even his longer novels (Atonement, Saturday) are essentially a collection of short stories combined into a whole, each of them perfectly researched, beautifully presented.  McEwan has evolved over the years, and his macabre, almost lurid, early stories have turned into subtle novellas exploring science and the arts (Amsterdam perhaps his best), to the longer pieces that examine all phases of a particular theme.    Saturday took place all in one day.  On Chesil Beach takes place all in a moment.  An entire novella devoted to what precedes then succeeds that one perfect moment in time.    I think this latest work is one of his finest.
B000000H57|5.0|Type O Negative is a band known for its moody spooky doom metal sound. Whether sometimes slighly corny the music itself is still amazing. This, next to World Coming Down, is one of my favorites by them. 90% of the songs on this album are at least good to great. The cd itself starts out with a slight joke to kind of get you acquainted with the band and their jokely nature. It then kicks out right into music with a pretty awesome opener \\"Love You To Death\\".  The best songs on the cd, or at least my personal favorites are at the top \\"Wolf Moon\\", \\"Be My Druidess\\", \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen\\", and \\"In Praise Of Bacchus\\". The albums pretty much loaded with great tracks. Here's my ratings... (excluding interludes)<br /><br />3. Love You To Death - 9.5/10<br />4. Be My Druidess - 10/10<br />5. Green Man - 10/10<br />6. Red Water (Christmas Mourning) - 7.5/10<br />7. My Girlfriend's Girlfriend - 8.5/10<br />8. Die With Me - 9/10<br />9. Burnt Flowers Fallen - 10/10<br />10. In Praise Of Bacchus - 10/10<br />11. Cinnamon Girl - 8/10<br />13. Wolf Moon - 10/10<br />14. Haunted - 6/10<br /><br />Overall : 88% B+<br /><br />Since the last song's the weakest it's not a great way to end the album but the amazing songs on the rest of the cd make up for it. It's just too bad \\"Wolf Moon\\" wasn't the last track. Anyway the whole ambiance of the entire album is amazing, that's why the cd still gets 5 stars. A really really awesome listen.
B00005JODK|5.0|\\"Hairspray\\" is full-blown entertainment, a fun-filled musical comedy that pulls no punches when it comes to spectacle. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and I have no doubt that anyone who sees it will feel the same way. Here's a film that truly knows how to make the audience feel good, thanks to some notable talents: Marc Shaiman's soulful music is upbeat and infectious; leads like John Travolta, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Queen Latifah give performances perfectly suited for this kind of story; David Gropman's production design, Rita Ryack's costume designs, and Judi Cooper-Sealy's hair designs make for an absolutely dead on look. This film--and you'll pardon the pun--hits all the right notes. I expected nothing less from a film adaptation of a Tony winning musical play, which itself is based on the 1988 film written and directed by John Waters.    Taking place in Baltimore in the year 1962, \\"Hairspray\\" tells a story that's equal parts humor, heart, and social commentary, all of which are strung together through song. The main character is Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a big-haired teenager who dreams of making a name for herself, despite being overweight. She also dreams of a Baltimore that doesn't segregate because of skin color. Overcoming adversity is not a new to storytelling, but it certainly is relatable, which is probably why we root for this character so passionately. As she sings \\"Good Morning, Baltimore\\"--the opening song--her strong resolve practically flies off of the screen, filling us with the kind of admiration usually reserved for older, more experienced people. Nonetheless, she is a teenager at heart, as seen with her devotion to \\"The Corny Collins Show,\\" an energetic (and segregated) music variety program hosted by the aptly named Corny Collins (James Marsden).    Tracy auditions for the show, only to face the wrath of Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), the deliciously wicked station manager. She wouldrather die than see this fat, pro-integration young girl dance on \\"Corny Collins\\"; not only would it spoil the station's reputation, it would also mean new competition for her bratty daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow), who's aiming to win the upcoming Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant. In realizing the situation, Tracy decides to organize a protest march. Offering their full support are Seaweed Stubbs (Elijah Kelley) and his mother, Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), who also hosts the once monthly Negro Day on \\"Corny Collins.\\" This aspect of the story was interesting, mostly because the seriousness of the Civil Rights Movement was successfully given a light-hearted spin. It was in no way offensive--if anything, its message was made even clearer.    A number of subplots weave their way through the film. One of the most important involves Tracy's mother, Edna, perfectly played by John Travolta. There's a refreshing complexity to this character that I wasn't expecting; she's a housebound laundress who uses her weight as an excuse to hold herself back. But with the love of her husband, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), and with a little help from Tracy, a newfound self-esteem begins to emerge. One of the film's most enjoyable scenes is of Edna's fashion makeover, a highly choreographed number that shows her in her best light. This character could have easily been a joke; the reality is that a male actor had to sing and dance in drag while wearing a fat suit. Fortunately, Travolta so thoroughly disappears into his role that any degree of phoniness is overshadowed. Edna Turnblad is a silly character that I wholeheartedly believed in.    Another subplot involves Link Larkin (Zac Efron), a regular on \\"Corny Collins\\" and a teen heartthrob in every sense. Initially an item with Amber, the young singer/dancer finds himself drawn to Tracy after she joins the show. Of course, Tracy is absolutely wild about Link, with his slick black hair, his Elvis-inspired dance moves, and his romantic singing voice. Why else would she have a picture of him inside her school locker? Her puppy love comes across during \\"I Can Hear the Bells,\\" a delightfully naïve song which documents her future with Link. Listening to her sing is her best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), a peppy young girl who constantly sucks on a lollipop. She eventually takes part in her own subplot; she and Seaweed begin an interracial romance, much to the dismay of her ridiculously traditional mother, Prudy (Allison Janney).    All this and more make for a film that's begging to be experienced. \\"Hairspray\\" is a nonstop good time, filled to the brim with energy and soul. Every character, every song, and every dance step work together flawlessly, and I just couldn't keep myself from smiling. I loved everything about it, from the performances to the music to the story. I have the feeling this will someday become a classic among American musicals, a beloved treasure of the same caliber as \\"Grease.\\"
B00007AJF9|2.0|We had been learning about Elizabeth in our history class and we watched the beginning of the movie in class and I thought it was GREAT so I bought the movie (because we didn't watch the rest of it in class) and I was very disappointed with the rest of the film.  It was boring and slower moving and never really came to a good resolve.
B00003CX9E|4.0|Love it, hate it, or be indifferent, Citizen Kane is clearly an American Classic. It holds such power in the cinema world due to the immensity of its themes - ego, the will to power, the American Dream silver trail from poverty to immense wealth, the overarching power and instability of the media, the effect of women and men on each other. It is a contender for the Great American Movie - just like the parallel battle for Great American Novel. This is something only realy done in the USA. No one speaks of the Great British Movie, or the Great European Movie - the same paradigm just doesn't seem to appear for the more varied, fragmented film industries over here. But in America you have to strive to be the best, the greatest. Orson Welles, a fledgling director and star knew he was grappling with something immense here, and he holds true course well throughout. The movie is a compelling jigsaw puzzle plot with fantastically original cinematography (for its time, though there is a big debt to early Hitchcock), that slots in place revelations about a complex, turbulent character of a paragon of the Great American Male. The rewards are immense - but the sacrificies can be ruinous. And what use are all those gilded possessions in the end when they're carted away and burned? The ego is fragile, consciousness transient, and everyone knows how even the greatest stories must end eventually.
B000286S8S|4.0|Some key songs are missing.    So don't call this \\"The Essential V.an H.alen\\", b/c it is not.    I agree.  Where is \\"Cabo Wabo\\", \\"Ice Cream Man\\", \\"Get Enough\\", \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Pleasure Dome\\", \\"Judgement Day\\", \\"Somebody get me a Doctor\\", \\"In and Out\\", \\"Hang 'em High\\", and \\"Intruder\\"?!    It does have their stand out songs and their most popular songs from the David Lee Roth days and Sammy Hagar days, and also it has David Lee Roth's best V.H. song - \\"Hot for Teacher\\" and David's heaviest V.H. song - \\"Unchained\\", so at least that's something.     These CDs has a lot of good songs, but it is also missing a lot of good songs too.    Overall, I don't think too highly about David Lee Roth; the total goofball who has a fairly nice singing voice but a pathetic personality, and who thought that the band centered and revolved all around him, and who was way too goofy and too much of a clown, except for the \\"Fair Warning\\" CD which is the 1 and only time that David Lee Roth was ever serious about anything.    I don't really hate Roth in V.an H.alen b/c he did have a few very good songs with them, but his overall goofy and egoistical personality surely did not add anything to the band, and it turned some people away from them.    Yeah, Roth had a few really good songs with V.H.  Yes, he did.  Most of which are on these 2 CDs.    So, I will leave it at that.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|This is meant to have the genre \\"comedy\\". I dont really see that this is the right genre because it is very touching that I even cried..It actually gives valuable life lessons that every person needs to know. I have always wanted to u know have a remote control controlling my life but this movie shows that life has a taste of letting things happen without the knowledge of what is going to happen.     I strongly recommend this movie for everyone because it will let u know something you should know...and I also felt that I have achieved something after I've watched it because unlike other aimless movies I believe that I now have an aim...If u know what I mean
B000002UEB|5.0|Total musical perfection.  Even with the spoken parts too.    This is not only one of the absolute best 80's CDs, but it is one of the absolute best Rock CDs ever made, if not the best.    You absolutely can not go wrong with this CD at all if you even remotely like Rock or Metal.    Not a bad song or a bad anything on this entire CD from beginning to end.    I can't say enough good things about this CD.    This is hands-down Queensryche's best CD.

B00005MAM2|5.0|You'll understand the title after you've seen the movie. Know this: when this anime hit theaters (yes, it was on a limited run), I can't imagine anybody but the underground really knowing what they were getting into. In the States, animation was either Disney/ Looney Tunes or those old, badly dubbed Speed Racer cartoons. \\"Akira\\" changed all of that. Decades later, the film still holds up against your average Adult Swim anime. Its adult themes, gloriously colored animation and haunting soundtrack still inspire awe. Admittedly, the story gets a bit confusing - but pay attention to the amoeba. This one'll leave you screaming \\"Tetsuoooooooo!\\" and wanting more.
B000001GRE|2.0|When it comes to musical narrative, Mr. Boulez is at a loss.  His specialty is conceptual music:  Music which expresses a musical idea.  Well, all music does that.  But some music goes further to explore emotion through the idea, an idea paramount to Mahler.    The Seventh is Mahler's Night Symphony, emerging in the daylight in the final movement.  Such things are hardly significant to Boulez in his reading. If only phrases like 'Allegro risoluto, ma non troppo', 'Flott', 'Tempo I', 'Molto pesante e misurato', 'Nicht eilen', 'Ganz zuruckhaltend', 'Moderato', 'Wieder Tempo I (Allegro)' meant anything to him, the first movement might have had some shape to it.  These indications not only give character to the music, but define themes and form.  The impression is that Boulez steamrolls through the music, barely (an exaggeration, really) giving credence to these tempo fluctuations.  As a result, the first movement is episodic and formless.  Too bad, because formally, this sonata-allegro movement is one of Mahler's tightest.    Again, in the second movement, '...molto moderato (andante)', 'Gehalten', 'Poco meno mosso', etc., we have tempo-steamrolling, the sense of one tempo in a multifariously tempo-ed movement.  The movement comes off formless and flat.      One would expect Boulez to bring out the modernisms in the 3rd movement.  All of those sforzandi, accents, accelerations against a set tempo.  Surprisingly, the impression is bland.  I think Boulez is so concerned about tempering the balance, these bumps and bangs in the night just don't register.  Again, tempo- steamrolling doesn't help matters.      4. Satz NACHTMUSIK - Andante amoroso.  This would have to be the least 'loving' andante I've ever heard, or could imagine.  Boulez' tempo is too fast.  Mahler takes pains to shorten 16th notes by adding 32nd notes and rests, giving character to a motive which runs througout the movement.  At this speed, they are impossible to play convincingly, and the character of the motive is lost.   Again, tempo- steamrolling results in flatness.  And the mandolin and guitar, the serenade instruments required for this movement only, are 'blended' into the texture to the point of almost extinction.      As for the finale, it contains some of the most frequent tempo changes in any movement of Mahler.  To make this rondo finale work, all of these changes must be felt and exaggerated.  With nothing more than musical indications on the page, it is no wonder that Boulez fails to render any coherent form to this movement.  So much for daylight.    The playing of the Cleveland Orchestra is very good, but surprisinly tentative.  I heard them live in New York performing the same work with their regular conductor Franz Welser-Most.  The playing was more natural and confident. It was a terrific Mahler 7th.     If you want to 'know' Mahler's 7th Symphony, I would recommend Chailly, Bernstein (2nd recording), Barenboim, or Abbado.

0714834491|5.0|This has to be one of the most amazing books I have ever read / seen / encountered. First, although I have read every word of this amazing text, I cannot say that one reads it as much as experiences it. I received it from my amazingly perceptive and wise wife for Christmas of 2006, and I took it to the relatives' house that day. All day, while everyone else was playing Rummikube and watching football, I was browsing through my \\"giant book.\\"   The design is gorgeous, with fascinating fonts and colors and layouts on every page. The content is an adventure, with information on everything from Salvadore Dali to ancient runes, to the power of an elephant's trunk. There is an amazing \\"shadow motorcycle\\" on page 48 which you must see to believe, and there's a photo of a faded cardboard box that the author found to be interesting.   When I finally finished it, I closed it sadly and told my wife that I'd read every word and studied every image in the \\"giant book.\\" She asked, \\"What will you do now?\\"  \\"Read it again, of course,\\" I replied.   When I was considering a birthday present for my 29 year old son who is a web designer for an advertising firm, this was my first and only thought. He liked it so much that he brought it to his workplace and told his colleagues to dip into it when they needed inspiration. They did, and they love it too.  Get this book. It will change your life! (A little).

B000KJU182|5.0|This is a classic film about a classic book.  The cast is just right, even the odd choice of Robert Ryan as the Master at Arms,  and after almost wearing out the tape of my VHS version I was delighted that it is now available on DVD.  Peter Ustinov is the driving force behind this production and it is clear that this is a labor of love.  Highly recommended

Everything is perfect in this album, voice, instrumental sound, and the duets between Benson and Jarreau. Really very good. We cannot deny that Benson and Jarreau are the two best celebrities of contemporary jazz, they show this singing togheter. A gift for us that are fan of then. Really very good.
B00081U7HC|5.0|While I was skeptical about this movie before watching it, I was completely taken aback by its wonderful story and enduring lessons. It was the appropriate combination of romance, comedy, and drama which made this movie, while still a chick flick, one that is heart touching and emphasises the importance of judging a person by their character and not simply thier professions. It also emphasises the importance of not making assumptions about people in order to figure out the essence of the true person. A heartwarming film - much recommended!

B000PFUA9G|4.0|This CD really shows the humorous side of Brad Paisley.  Even most of the slower songs on this CD have a funny side to them and for the most part the CD is very upbeat.  It puts a funny twist to the normal my girlfriend just left me, my dog just died, or I'm dying stuff Tim McGraw's been doing for the last few years.  Tim could definitely take some pointers from Brad on this one in my opinion, lighten up, and quit with the put you to sleep songs he's been doing so boringly for quite a while now!
B000P2A24W|4.0|This album is a very good album, John Bon Jovi is a very talented man. But of coarse the rest of the band has their responsibilities as well. The only reason I rate it with 4 stars is because this album sound a little different then past albums; but it was supposed to, It is a great album and I don't regret buying it at all, I am very happy I bought it. The only reason why I am telling that I don't regret buying it is because I am the type of person that will Buy a full album for just one song. And you know it must be a great album, because I bought it for just one song, and that song isn't even the song that I want to listen to all time because there is a better song on the cd. Its the type of song that you want to play very loud because you can enjoy it more that way. and as soon as you have the cd and play it you will know exactly what song I am talking about. Enjoy the cd once you have it.

B00005JMYI|5.0|This is a movie I could watch once a week and always laugh out loud (as well as always replay the dog over the bridge scene for extra laughs). There are more outrageously bizarre and side-splittingly funny moments in this movie than any I can think of, and after four plus decades on planet earth (you stay classy...), I've seen a lot. The entire cast is brilliant, the satire gleefully over-the-top, and the plot, well, are you really curious about a plot? Who cares? Check your prudishness at the door and get ready to choke on your popcorn and spit-take your beverage as this movie will make you laugh your breathtaking hiney off. This is one of those Caddyshack-type movies that will have you dropping lines from it and getting the knowing winks and follow-up lines from those who have seen it as well. It is the gift of laughter to get for yourself or those who have a sense of humor that does not involve gentle mews of joy but loud guffaws of bombastic pleasure. If you don't find at least a half dozen solid belly laughs in this movie, then I don't think I want to know what you find funny.<br />By the way, the special features are funny, too, and numerous. Good stuff all the way around. Get it, laugh, and make your world a funnier place.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll say upfront, I was turned off to this series.  I love Sci-Fi but am also very picky about what I watch with the limited time I have.  On a slow shift at work someone put in Firefly.  I noticed it was a \\"Western Sci-Fi\\" and after a couple minutes thought it was pretty mediocre.  Someone later brought in the movie, Serenity.  They ranted and raved about it...of course, they were Firefly fans so what do you expect?  I watched it.  Meh.  Not bad, just not very memorable, either.  \\"Oh, but you need to watch the series to really appreciate it!\\"  I left it at that.    Fast forward to over a year later.  I share things with my sig. other all the time, and she said it was time to share something with me. Firefly.  Firefly?  God no, anything but that!  She's even pickier about Sci-Fi than I am, and at this point I didn't have much of a choice but to sit down with an open mind.  She put in the episode \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" and said it was a great intro episode to get to know the characters, good story and some really classic moments.  The credits roll and I have to admit I was intrigued.  I really enjoyed it.  Was this the same series I wanted to blow off so many times before?  I still wasn't hooked, though.  Then we watch the first 3 episodes.    We finished the series in a week.  I was the show's newest initiate, equally angry that Fox cancelled such a brilliant show.  Unfortunately it was probably because of those like me who never gave it a chance in the beginning.    Oh I almost forgot.  Needless to say, after watching the series I wanted to see Serenity the movie again.  It was so forgettable to me the first time I hardly remembered any of it.  It was nothing like I remembered.  I loved it!  There are those who say to watch the movie first to get an idea of the show.  Do NOT watch the movie first.  Trust me, you'll be watching it with very different eyes.  It's not about the quality of the movie or seeing it with a fan's bias.  There's so much backstory, so much character development that you need to be aware of before going into the movie, that without watching the series first you're just skimming the surface and not seeing how much depth the movie really has.    Off my personal experience, I would recommend showing \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" first if you want someone to get a really good impression of the characters, humor, devlopment, and just a fun story to start out with.    Take a chance, and you'll be kicking yourself for not having watched it sooner.
B000I9VOCQ|4.0|Disquieting and unique, High Plains Drifter is not your grandfather's western. Eastwood's sophomore directorial effort borrows from many sources and Clint pays his respects to the styles of both Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone for this offbeat western. Part western, part psychological treatise, and all Clint, this is a unique vision of the western that delivers a sharp commentary on fear, guilt, revenge, and greed. The acting is very good with highlights including Geoffrey Lewis as head bad guy Stacey Bridges and Verna Bloom as the lone conscience of the town. Eastwood's Stranger character is a mixed bag of misogyny and righteousness delivered in his trademark laconic style.<br />This movie forces us to confront our own moral ambiguity and is a highlight of the revisionist westerns of the time.<br />The dvd offers little in the way of special features save a trailer, some filmographies, and a brief write-up about the making of the feature.
1592220053|5.0|If you are a fan of 'A Song of Ice and Fire' read this book. If you are a fan of science-fiction read this book. If you are a fan of reading read this book. I, probably like most of the other reviewers, started reading George R.R. Martin's 'Ice and Fire' series years ago. But only recently, while rereading 'Ice and Fire', did I decide to get hold of some of Martin's other work. About a month ago I started with Fevre Dream and I am pleased to report that it was a terrific read and a fine example of horror/adventure literature. But sadly, it just didn't compare with Ice and Fire. A week later I stumbled across a reprint of 'Dying of the Light' in a bookstore and I was all too happy to give another of George's works a go. I was pleasantly rewarded again. After starting a bit slow 'Dying' turned into another great read in the sci-fi/suspense category. However, it didn't really come close to comparing with 'Ice and Fire' either.    Enter 'Tuf Voyaging'. I ordered this paperback edition off of amazon several days ago. When it arrived I took some time before starting it but I finally cracked it open last night at around 1 am. I finished it at about 5 am. It was that good. No, it was better than good, it's the most satisfying and awesome sci-fi collection or novel I have ever read.     The books follows the story of titular character Haviland Tuf. Tuf is an honest cat-loving space trader who has fallen on hard times because of his quirky tastes in trade-goods (he is likely the only interstellar merchant who has a cargo-hold full of alien orgy masks). But Tuf is also singularly brilliant and possessed of a deeply compassionate nature (though at times he admittedly seems more caustic than compassionate). So when Tuf finds himself trapped aboard an unimaginably powerful ancient starship (that holds the ecological secrets of virtually every planet in the galaxy) with a variety of cutthroat mercenaries and heartless scientists he is forced to take action to prevent the ship fromfalling into deadly hands. This begins the most wildly entertaining space saga you're likely to ever read.    As readers of 'Ice and Fire' likely know, George R.R. Martin is a fantastic storyteller and perhaps the greatest voice in the history of fantasy. Sure, if you're a traditionalist and want absolutely comprehensive storytelling read Tolkien, but if you want truly compelling prose then read Martin. He can build astonishingly beautiful worlds full of characters who are far more than the usual two-dimensional 'villains and heroes' fare seemingly inherent to mainstream sci-fi/fantasy.     And if you are somehow afraid of sci-fi (and are pondering whether a few dollars spent in the sci-fi games will be worth it) think no more. The endless creativity and the incredible character-building featured in 'Tuf' is proof positive that George R.R. Martin is one of the greatest writers not only in sci-fi/fantasy, but in contemporary literature. If you haven't started reading him yet you're way behind. And there's no better way to start than with 'Tuf Voyaging'.     If you've already read 'Ice and Fire' then I can virtually guarantee you that you'll love to voyage with Haviland Tuf. So far it's the only work of Martin's I've read that compares with 'Ice and Fire' in any meaningful way, and I'm shocked to tell you that it might be just as good (though most of you might doubt me on that). But one thing is for sure, if you buy this book prepare for a literary feast providied by one of your favorite authors. You won't regret it.

They give their lives and their all for their fellow Americans.  Mr. Luttrell plunges the reader into his and his \\"band of brothers'\\" dangerous mission and the \\"grit\\" with which they all served.  A story we need to know to personalize who it is that is protecting us and our freedon. The men and women who serve unsung and without an eye towards glory.

They could burn my flag or pelt me with stones, but if there were taxidermied kittens to be had then I would go and bring them back to this, the greatest country on earth.\\"<br /><br />David Sedaris's new collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day, tells a most unconventional life story. It begins with a North Carolina childhood filled with speech-therapy classes (\\"There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling than that was my voice itself with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch\\") and unwanted guitar lessons taught by a midget. From budding performance artist (\\"The only crimp in my plan was that I seemed to have no talent whatsoever\\") to \\"clearly unqualified\\" writing teacher in Chicago, Sedaris's career leads him to New York (the sky's-the-limit field of furniture moving) and eventually, of all places, France.<br /><br />Sedaris's move to Paris poses a number of challenges, chief among them his inability to speak the language. Arriving a \\"spooky man-child\\" capable of communicating only through nouns, he undertakes language instruction that leads him ever deeper into cultural confusion. Whether describing the Easter bunny to puzzled classmates, savoring movies in translation (It Is Necessary to Save the Soldier Ryan), or watching a group of men play soccer with a cow, Sedaris brings a view and a voice like none other.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Each and every new release from Brad Paisley brings a smile to my face.  His sense of fun and his clever use of lyrics make his albums (CD's) a must have.

0812976525|4.0|In the daily melodramas of Washington life--at least the stock versions offered by the hometown paper and the network news--the plots are predictable and the characters easy to read. We have good guys (public-interest lawyers, environmentalists, idealistic congressmen calling for an \\"expanded federal role\\"), and we have bad guys (pro-lifers, Second Amendment enthusiasts, people with Pentagon contracts). And then we have the really, really bad guys: the publicists, talking heads, and spinmeisters of the Tobacco Institute, the infamous lobbying arm of the tobacco industry.<br /><br />Watching one of these poor souls bob and weave on MacNeil-Lehrer, or grimace through a grilling on the morning shows, you can't help wondering: What's it like to be so openly hated, so contemptuously disbelieved, as the fellow who drags himself from bed each morning to defend a product only slightly more popular than Thalidomide? Does his mom hate him, too? Does his wife believe him when he explains why he's late for dinner? Do the kids mind when the Discovery channel compares dad to Himmler? Has he never thought of chucking it all for an easier job--say, writing jokes for Elie Wiesel?<br /><br />Not all of those human questions are specifically asked and answered by Christopher Buckley in Thank You for Smoking, his new satirical novel; actually, none of them is. But Mr. Buckley has set for himself the large task of entering that rarefied circle of PR hell where the tobacco spokesman resides, to give him flesh and depth, to show with some sympathy his inner life, to share his pain. And then to kill him off. Or almost kill him off.<br /><br />Our hero is Nick Naylor, chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies (for which read: the Tobacco Institute). Like many spokesfolk, Nick is a journalist who failed upward. As a local Washington TV reporter he made the mistake one evening of announcing to a live television audience that the President had, in fact, died, when he had, in fact, not. For that minor error he was removed from the trade of journalism and entered the trade of public relations, where inaccuracy is more highly prized. The pay is better, too.<br /><br />Nick's job of ceaseless prevarication does not especially trouble him. And Mr. Buckley records his dissembling with such precision, and such relish, that we won't be especially bothered by it, either. Here, to take one of his riffs at random, is Nick pleading for a ceasefire in the smoking wars, with Katie Couric (one of many media stars who make cameos in the novel): \\"Well, Katie, you can't spell tolerance without the t in tobacco. Our position all along has been, we understand there are people who care strongly about smoking. We're saying, Let's work together on this. Let's get some dialogue going. This is a big country, a great country, and there's plenty of room in it for smoking and nonsmoking areas.\\"<br /><br />The patter is worthy of Elmer Gantry or Professor Harold Hill. Like them, too, Nick is a bottomless fount of information. Did you know that smoking prevents Parkinson's disease? Scientific data suggest that it does. And smoking reduces the incidence of carpal-tunnel syndrome, since smokers take more frequent breaks from their computer keyboards. At the same time, bans on smoking in the workplace have led to an alarming rise in pneumonia, from thrusting smokers into the elements merely because they've chosen to enjoy a pleasurable recreational activity enjoyed by forty million other Americans.<br /><br />In thus defending the right to smoke, Nick is cheered on by the MOD Squad--a small luncheon group that takes its name from its members' reputations as Merchants of Death. Charter members are Bobby Jay, of \\"SAFETY, the Society for the Advancement of Firearms and Effective Training of Youth, formerly NRTBAC, the National Right to Bear Arms Committee,\\" and Polly of the \\"Moderation Council, formerly the National Association for Alcoholic Beverages.\\"<br /><br />I do not doubt that in the vast chow dens of Washington, some equivalent of the MOD Squad actually exists. \\"Their guests had come from such groups as the Society for the Humane Treatment of Calves, representing the veal industry, the Friends of Dolphins, formerly the Pacific Tuna Fishermen's Association, the American Highway Safety Association, representing triple-trailer truckers, the Land Enrichment Foundation, formerly the Coalition for the Responsible Disposal of Radioactive Waste, and others.\\"<br /><br />What brings this sad band of brothers and sisters together is their shared fate: to defend, for pay, the quotidian pleasures and practices of American life against the assaults of a new, aggressive, and spectacularly priggish political culture. But the MOD Squad's solidarity is sorely tested when the going gets even tougher, as it does when a band of anti-smoking zealots (or so it seems) kidnaps Nick and attempts to terminate him with extreme prejudice, by plastering him with (what else?) nicotine patches. From here the plot accelerates; I won't spoil your pleasure by telling you where it leads, except to say that you'll be amazed at where you end up.<br /><br />Thank You for Smoking is at once a mystery, a political drama, and a knowing social satire of the first rank.<br /><br />It's a dicey combination, and I can't think of another contemporary American novelist who could pull it off with such dexterity and high spirits.

B00006AW2G|2.0|I bought this album after initially being satisfied that my 3cd Stones' compilation and their later \\"Jump back\\" compilation were sufficient for having the best Stones' songs. What changed? I saw Mick Jagger perform solo in Australia many years ago and a guy I went to the concert with got excited when a certain song started to be played [along with the audience]. I asked what it was...thought he said \\"Jimmy Shelter\\", which just confused me!    Anyway, when I heard Jagger play that song live, I considered it to be an instant classic. It's started to be played more on Australian commercial FM radio since then, fortunately. And I do remember this song being listed on some internet poll as the Stone's greatest song...a sentiment I have to agree with, or at least share the honour with \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\". Gimme Shelter just has has a nice subtle guitar sound and male/female vocals which put goosebumps on the back of your neck.    On this album, there is distortion of this song, and I'm guessing that the recording technology was not able to capture the bigness of this song's sound.    So, why only two stars for this album? Firstly, I don't give albums a lot of stars for merely having ONE great song on it. Secondly, like I say in the headline of my review, this album is passing strange-I did NOT expect an album full of blues and country music from a pop/rock group!    It's been a while since I've listened to this album after I bought it recentlylish [some months ago]-so, going on memory, I think that \\"Country honk\\" is what WOULD become a compilation staple, Honky Tonk Women. Unfortunately, it is a little too country for me.    This album does have other songs that often make Stones' compilations, but it's just that I don't particularly like those songs! E.g. \\"You can't always get what you want\\".    If you've never heard \\"Gimme Shelter\\" [which absolutely shines as a song due to the great female vocals in the song], then either buy this album, or the Stones' compilation\\"Hot Rocks\\". If you choose to buy this album, however, then make sure you like or are open to blues and country music.    I'm not sure if this album often gets listed as one of the Stones' great albums, but for me it is not that good [this is the only regular Stones' album I have, along with my two compilations comprising 4 cds].    For die hard fans only, I think, though Gimme Shelter is a 5 star song, in my opinion.

0618551050|1.0|I read over Lee Smolin's book, and had some major problems with it.  The first is his contention that nothing of importance has happened in  particle physics in the last 30 years. In fact, there has been continual  progress on the experimental side: precision measurements at LEP,   discovery of top, discovery of neutrino oscillations, along with   various developments in cosmology leading to knowledge of amounts of dark matter   and dark energy. The Standard Model, which was on a shaky foundation in 1975, is solidly on track for physics at the 100 GeV scale and below. However, the new data mentioned above show that the Standard Model is not the whole story. Hopefully, when LHC turns on, we will learn a whole lot more about physics at the TeV scale. Now should we have had a revolution on the theory side? Of course not. The SM works  exceedingly well, and experiment tells us that relativistic QFT and the SM are  the correct understanding of physics at these energy scales. Would any revolution,  and overturning of relativity or quantum mechanics match the quantitative success of the SM? *Highly doubtful*!    Second, he complains that string theory doesn't have one successful prediction.  Well, if you look at the history of Yang-Mills theory, it didn't have one successful  prediction either during its first 12-16 years of existence. Predictions had to await the technical developments of t'Hooft-Veltman. Now string theory is a *lot* more  complicated than Yang-Mills, but it certainly looks like it is on the right track.  One helping point will be some experimental data at the TeV scale. That is coming soon, and such input from the experiment side will have a strong positive effect of string theory, I believe.

B00003CXDB|1.0|Maybe this was a good film in 1987, but by today's standards it is god awful.  The only entertainment value comes from watching Michael Douglas talk on a cell phone the size of a shoe, then later he's amazed by a handheld television set.  Other than that small amount of nostalgia, this is a horribly acted, poorly written, cliche filled mess.  I cannot understand the positive reviews this gets, even by late 1980s standards.  If you really want to hear some terrible dialogue, just watch the part when the union boss walks into Douglas' office.  I thought I was watching a cheesy John Wayne impression.  Boiler Room is the one to watch, at least that has some decent acting.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|I had every intention of buying this great movie on DVD and canceled my Amazon order for it when:  a) I learned it has no extras whatsoever.  b) I learned that the previews on this DVD include a trailer for a 2008 upcoming, loaded, special edition.  The importance of extras for me vary depending of the nature of each film but I believe a DVD edition of Zodiac cries for plenty of information on the actual case. Knowing for a fact such an edition is coming out next year makes it a no-brainer for me to wait a little longer.
1570627215|5.0|This gem of a story was enriched by its `on tape' version that I downloaded from our library catalog; it was beautifully read.  I could hear the OM calling to my core.<br /><br />It is a fascinating story of one in search of enlightenment, finding it losing it and finding it again only to realize it was always there!  In this mostly adult life description of a great prince who left the world we also see him so drawn back into it that we are reminded of our challenges to demonstrate sincere spiritual values and not allow ourselves to become numb.  The consequence of leaving home and family for this quest is painfully felt including trying to raise a spoiled child that he does not know and failing to do so.  Yet he comes back to the river, sees his reflection there, releases his baggage to the quiet river keeper, and then realizes with full certainty that he is a part of this flowing life; the river speaks to those willing and trying to listen and says, OM.<br /><br />It is a classic among literary choices and several of the high schools wisely and openly offer this as their junior year summer reading, placing or nurturing the seed of awareness at a time when it's most needed.  Most people I know read this book when it came out years ago.  It is said, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear; this book was one of my teachers.
B000AP04NI|4.0|These songs were instant hits from the time the show first appeared. I was around in that era, and I remember them well. They still work, in spite of being old-fashioned. The story, however, although I didn't think anything of it at the time, now strikes me as distinctly weird. There is a strangely sinister undercurrent being played out behind the front line, and it seems to be: If you don't fit in with the rest of us, like if you're a pedlar or a hired hand, get lost. In fact, we'll help you on your way, and may even try to persuade you to hang yourself. Is this the recommended tactic for a straight-shooting ideal cowboy? The dream, or substance-induced nightmare, dance sequence is very strange, and someone else has commented on the way it doesn't match the rest of the presentation. It seems to be dredged up from some suppressed vision of darkness, perhaps faintly similar to the hidden side of wholesome America in Lynch's Blue Velvet. Very curious. The music and lyrics are highly memorable. Wotcha gonna do if a fella gets flirty --- spit in his eye?  It's a pity Jud won't keep, but it's summer, and we're runnin' outta ice.

B000EQ4G5K|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised while listening to this disc - after hearing the first 2 singles, SOS & UNFAITHFUL, I wasn't sure what to expect but this is a terrific offering of pop with a dash of the island sounds so prevalent on her debut album.<br /><br />I was worried that the label was rushing out another album too quickly and that it would be horrible & filler heavy but with an \\"artist\\" like Rihanna, this is proving to be a smart tactic - she is not a great vocalist but the producers & writers she's working with ARE adept at creating catchy singles that top the charts.<br /><br />In addition to the two singles, I mentioned earlier other standout tracks are: KISSES DON'T LIE - I love the bass played throughout the song; FINAL GOODBYE - I love the guitar solo, she sounds really good on this track; BREAK IT OFF - nice dance track but Rihanna sounds like a guest on a Sean Paul track; PS (I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU) - nice chilled down groove; A MILLION MILES AWAY - pretty spare ballad; IF IT'S LOVIN THAT YOU WANT, PT II - I love the beats used on this track & WE RIDE - light r&b/pop track that makes good use of her vocals.<br /><br />Rihanna is not a powerhouse vocalist but overall this is a well-produced, fun album that I really enjoy listening to.

B00006IUL7|5.0|An intriguing, top-notch reworking of a Norwegian psychological thriller by \\"Memento\\" director Christopher Nolan, \\"Insomnia\\" gets a lot of mileage out of its picturesque Alaskan setting, since constant Northern daylight is the trigger for Dormer's sleepless (and guilt-ridden) nights. Pacino excels as the tortured cop whose error in judgment lands him in a cat-and-mouse game with his suspect, chillingly played by Williams. With strong support from Donovan and Swank (as a gung-ho rookie cop on the case), and a fabulous chase sequence on floating logs, this moody, gripping film will keep you wide awake.
0800141660|4.0|I like this movie, mostly because I like the original story. Like most movies that are created from good books, the movie just isn't the same. However, I still enjoy this movie in and of itself and have seen it several times. I do not think the story line is as strong in the movie as in the book, but it is still entertaining and interesting enough to watch. I enjoy Emma Thompson's performance immensely; Kate Winslet is decent.

B000096FUD|5.0|The tragic, comic lesson of \\"Lost in La Mancha\\": On most any major film production, even the combined presence of talent, inspiration, and hard work will fall short if fate conspires to intervene. The visionary Gilliam (director of \\"Brazil,\\" \\"12 Monkeys\\") comes off as an obsessive, driven iconoclast, willing to soldier on under the most dire of circumstances, but one man's determination is no match for the vagaries of chance and the elements. Director Fulton takes us behind the scenes for an up-close look at a film shoot that never stood a chance, and the effect is weirdly, almost perversely compelling.
B000P0J024|5.0|Three years ago I snapped up \\"Traveling Wilburys, Volume 3\\" from a used CD bin, and I couldn't believe my luck, as both Traveling Wilburys CDs had been out of print for many years, for some incomprehensive reason, as those albums are a treasure of American music. Now finally comes the long-overdue restauration of that.<br /><br />\\"The Traveling Wilburys Collection\\" brings the 2 albums, with bonus tracks, and a DVD. \\"Traveling Wilburys, Volume 1\\" (10 tracks, plus 2 bonus tracks, 42 min.) brings the beginning olf this super-star band, starting off with the irresitable \\"Handle With Care\\", originally contemplated as a George Harrison B-side for one of his \\"Cloud Nine\\" album singles. There is hardly a bad track on here: \\"Last Night\\", \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\", and my all-time favorite \\"End of the Line\\" are among the highlights. \\"Margarita\\" is the only weak track. The (previously unreleased) bonus tracks, \\"Maxime\\" and \\"Like a Ship\\" are outstanding. \\"Traveling Wilburys, Volume 3\\" (11 tracks, plus 2 bonus tracks, 42 min.) even goes one better, in my book. From the stellar opener \\"She's My Baby\\", to \\"Inside Out\\", \\"Where Were You Last Night\\" to the rousing and irresistable \\"Wilbury Twist\\", it is just magic. The bonus tracks \\"Nobody's Child\\" and a cover of \\"Runaway\\" are quite nice, but not as good as the regular album tracks. I know that many music fans are not as fond of \\"Volume 3\\" due to Roy Orbinson not being part of it, but for me, it is the better, tighter, sounding album of the two. I absolutely love \\"Volume 3\\".<br /><br />The DVD starts with a fascinating 40 min. documentary of the band's early days, bringing a blow-by-blow visual account of how most of the first album's tracks came about. What strikes is how great all those super-stars got along, egos were clearly checked at the door. It also brings the 5 videos the band did for the 2 albums, nice but not as good as the documentary. The liner notes are not that great, primarily a fictional history of the Wilburys, but no lyrics of the songs or detailed recording details. But that is a minor quible.

0226039331|5.0|As an older student of Greek and only recently feeling at ease with the Greek New Testament I am finding this book very useful.  I do agree with those who say that the large Liddell and Scott (LSJ) is also very useful.   My study so far has been in ancient Greek generally (from Homer to Koine) and I have used LSJ (and the abridged editions) extensively; it a good tool to give New Testament readers a wider view of particular meanings.    So if you can afford it I say buy Danker and LSJ, and if you don't know your Greek accents, get a good book on that too (such as the one by Probert).
055358202X|4.0|Good but losing some of the appeal from earlier books.  GRRM's decision to remove half the storyline and place it in a later book, coupled with multiple storylines and points of view means that some cliffhangers from the previous book remain unresolved.    The trademark grittiness and overabundance of clockwork cliffhangers at the end of each chapter are still here.  But something seems to be missing, perhaps edited out to appear in the next book.
0790729644|4.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" certainly looks beautiful, especially in HD. And I admit it is a very good film with a lot of good points, perfect timing, excellent acting, good characters, the works. And it has a lot more nuance than westerns normally have.    But I will contend that ultimately it still boils down to the same old thing: admiration for a killer.    When William Munny, in the charismatic and handsome frame of Clint Eastwood, rides out of Big Whiskey in the end, saying that if anybody hurt the prostitutes for putting up the blood money, he will come back and kill everybody, there is pretty much not anybody watching who does not feel deep in his/her gut: \\"my god, there is a MAN!\\" You just can't help it, it's in our dark nature.    And you can even see this excemplified in the admiring and longing looks given him by the writer fellow and by the prostitute with the scars, as they watch him leave.    There is no way around it: it is gut-level admiration for a man who by his own admission has killed many innocent men, and women, and children, and who killed several more just minutes ago. And the film aims for it, it is where it gets its marketing power.    I am shocked that I've been unable to find any other reviewers (professional or amateur) who really question this. It is not a \\"great wrong\\", but there's certainly nothing beautiful about it, and it needs to be recognized.    In a documentary about Eastwood, the narrator says about Unforgiven: \\"the sherif has tortured and killed Will's best friend. He has no choice but vengeance.\\" And that's the exact untruth to be uncovered. There is always a choice. Violence begets violence, and he who breaks the chain, wins.    Don't get me wrong, I am not villainizing \\"the Clint\\" here. His hyper-violent movie characters are merely reflecting an important aspect of human nature. I'm just saying it's an aspect we'd do well to look at some more.    Another way to express my problem with it: if you listen to the movie, it is clearly against violence. The characters say it many times. But if you look at the movie, it is clearly for it. The violence is presented in a way so it is enjoyable. A friend of mine said that the final big gun battle was \\"like an orgasm\\".    By the way, I'm just watching the documentary about the film, and DW Peoples (the writer) does say that the reason people think it's an anti-violence movie is that most other movies are \\"pro-violence\\" in the sense that if it is the good guy doing it to the bad guy, it's OK. But that reality is more complex, and that it's often difficult to pinpoint who's the \\"good guy\\" and who's the \\"bad guy\\". Which I think is wise. You'll notice that each participant in a fight always thinks of himself as the good guy.    I will concede that within the framework of a big, popular, Hollywood movie, this film is probably as far as we can currently go towards an anti-violence movie. If you'd made a movie like this and not made the violence seductive and aesthetic, it would instantly have lost 90% of its audience. At least.

In fact, I'm not exactly sure why these books have a different title since I don't think you'll appreciate them if you haven't read Farseer. Start with \\"Assasin's Apprentice.\\"     All told, though, these six books are the epitome of fantasy, and ought to rank very high in literature in general if general lit reviewers ever read fantasy. I can't recommend them highly enough.     Sure, you'll find a tedious 50 pages once or twice--but I challenge any lengthy work, including Tolkien, to avoid that. In these books, Hobb outclasses Martin, Bishop and anything else you've experienced, with the possible exception of the first Thomas Covenant book, Lord Foul's Bane.

I thought his earlier Power of Now was pretty good, but many of the ideas took a while to sink in (at least for me).    This book, however, is like the bible of enlightenment -- and I don't mean to sound blasphemic -- what I  mean is every line makes perfect sense on the first reading. Quite remarkable, really.    The author's primary objective in writing the book was to enlighten the reader, or in other words, wake you up. As Tolle alludes to time and time again, when you are truly awake, you will experience happiness.     This is Tolle's best book, as he has finally managed to express precisely what makes him englightened, with tact hitherto unseen. Whoever understands part of  his message will come away more enlightened. The goal is to understand his whole message...

With heroes who cannot speak, the music speaks ....for the dogs, and for the humans who had to leave, but will return.  The music speaks of vastness, cold, and despair, but also the hope that beauty brings, the beauty in the white ice and distant sun.    This is music to listen to sparingly.....on sunny days in winter....on Sunday morning....but it is music to keep, to revisit and renew.
B00005ASHM|3.0|Just because something is important doesn't make it great. Look at our current president, important, yes, great, not hardly. Yes this album is good and Brian Wilson deserves praise, but let's not go overboard. Springsteen, The Beatles, and others not only have one, but more than one album better than this. You Still Believe in Me, and Don't Talk sent me running for the phone to call the suicide hotline. These songs don't evoke much if any emotion and are droning. There are some very good songs on this album (Wouldn't if be Nice, Sloop John B, God Only Knows, and a couple others are good) but to be a great album, shouldn't most, if not all, of the songs be great? 2.5 stars.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I've always loved Linkin Park for their hard edged sound, and I really was in need of a fix when this album came out.   I was surprised . . . and not disappointed  . . .its a new softer sound.  Each song sucks you in slow starting with the introduction wake up.  They return to their hard edged formula with Given Up and Leave out all the rest slows things down.  It may have been better suited for the end of the CD since it's talking about death and rememberence.  The next song (title escapes me-- something about the sun) is kinda maudlin but you can listen to it.  After that a gradual instrumental into the lead off single What i've done which is genious lyricall vocally even down to the two guitar notes that starts the beat.  After that Mike the rapper returns to lead another ingenious song Hands Held High.      Buy this CD for that song.    For as soft as Linkin Park has gotten this song deals with some hard hitting issue, the president, war , inequalities.  The rest of the CD is great and I'm still kinda feeling my way through.  But this is my favorite CD this year.

Unfortunately, many cannot think outside the box...so they \\"don't get it.\\"  Too bad....for them.    This CD is awesome.  The songwriting is incredible.  What I honestly don't understand...if Clive wanted to re-work it, why not just rework the production to make it slicker and more radio-ready....the songs themselves are incredible.    I personally think this is a masterpiece.  I love the songs, the production, the whole package.  I know it's probably a tainted victory for Kelly....to have something so incredible...and to be so proud of it...and yet, to have mixed acceptance of it.    The one song I don't love is \\"Yeah\\"....but then others love it, so it's just more \\"personal taste.\\"  The rest, for me, is SPOT ON.    This CD is awesome.

0689859368|4.0|This is the first part of the five-part series \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, a great little set of stories that deals with the experiences of the Grace children - Mallory, and the twins Simon and Jared, who move with their recently-divorced mother into the Spiderwick Estate. Treated as an adaptation of real-life occurrences (each book begins with a copy of a letter signed by the \\"real\\" Grace children, and includes other bits of evidence citing the story's authenticity throughout), Black draws on a range of fairytales and folklore in order to give the activities that the children and the assortment of faeries get up to a sense of resonance.<br /><br />The children themselves are well-developed for such a slim volume: Mallory is a rapier-wielding tomboy who seems to have no sense of how attractive she is, Simon is a quiet animal-lover with an ever-growing menageries of pets, and Jared is his frustrated, somewhat talent-less twin who is suffering the worst under the strains of the divorce. Black doesn't shy away from Jared's deep-seated anger and abandonment issues, though it would be nice if she had painted Mrs Grace in a slightly more sympathetic light (as it is, the children's mother doesn't seem to be particularly interested in her children's welfare).<br /><br />Once belonging to their great-aunt, the Spiderwick Estate is now derelict and ramshackle, and there are strange things going on inside.

B000RJO578|3.0|I loved Shaun of the Dead, seeing it in the theater and owning it on DVD. My only complaint would be that it starts off great but finishes by taking itself way too seriously.    Hot Fuzz has the opposite problem... it starts off taking itself way too seriously and doesn't get wonderfully funny until the final third of the movie.     The setup is excruciating, but the payoff is pretty funny. Assuming you have the patience to get there.

B000PKG6TE|3.0|Like Lullabies to Paralyze, this is a frustratingly uneven effort.  Unfortunately, I think Josh Homme is now too creatively spent to be able to write an album worth of interesting material in a 2-3 year time frame.  There are several strong tracks (Misfit Love, Make it Wit'Chu, 3s & 7s, and Running Joke come to mind) but, as a whole, Era Vulagris leaves the lasting impression of having been a long, pointless drone with a lot of undistinguished musicianship and unmemorable riffs and hooks.        If you're just getting into QOTSA, the awesome self titled debut is the best place to start.  Songs for the Deaf is also excellent, although it probably took about 6 listens for its greatness to start to sink in for me, and the quality falls off after the first five tracks.  Rated R is also an interesting and varied listen.

In the Court of the Crimson King was a bold, dramatic statement, an uncomprimising record that seamlessly combined hard rock (in the 60s sense of the word. Think Blue Cheer and Cream) with psychedelia and elements of jazz and high-minded poetic grandeur. The eye-popping cover art and suite-style song structures sealed the deal, and a new style of music was born: Progressive rock. Indeed, just about every act that has ever been labled \\"prog,\\" from Pink Floyd to Yes to Jethro Tull and onward through the likes of Radiohead and the Mars Volta can trace the basis of their sound back to the 'Crim's first record. Robert Fripp's slashing guitar chords and nimble melodies bridged the gap between hevy metal and art rock (before either style was really a full-fledged genre, Black Sabbath and the Velvets notwithstanding), while multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald gave the music a jazzy, textured complexity, weather he was playing the flute, the vibes, or the mellotron, and Greg Lake's vocals were quintessential prog: Technically acomplished, dramatic, and high-minded. Michael Giles' drumming picked up where Fripp's guitar left off, spanning the (not all that wide) space between rock and jazz. Topping the whole shebang off were Peter Sinfield's lyrics, which were abstract and poetic in the extreme, a set of textures and images rather than coherent statements.     But you probably want to know if the music's good. Well, here's the deal: No matter how good a progressive rock band is (and believe me, King Crimson were very, very good), they (pretty much) inevitably succumb to a few pitfalls. The most common is pretention. On this particular record, the most obvious victim of that malady is \\"Epitaph.\\" The song's eight minutes don't produce a single memorable melody, and Sinfield's lyrics are obtuse in the extreme. They amble through a series of references to men being \\"torn apart/ with nightmares and with dreames\\" and \\"the iron gates of fate\\" without producing a single good line. It doesn't help that Lake seems to think he's singing scripture, stuffing each sylable with forced drama and unreasonably present passion. The song does have a sort of lumbering majesty (created, pretty much, by sheer force of will), but it's far from a classic. And its typically bloated length insures that it'll overstay its welcome. And then there's the notorious \\"Moonchild,\\" which features a ten-minute instrumental \\"freak-out\\" section, the only truly interesting aspect of which is its odd quietness. Otherwise, it's every bit as overblown and indulgent as the very worst of 60s sound \\"experiments.\\"     Otheer than that, though, this is a really great listen. My personal favorite track is the achingly beautiful \\"I Talk To The Wind,\\" a haunting dreamscape with some of Sinfield's most poignant lyrics. The chorus shows off the subtleties of Lake's considerable voice, as he twists his vocal chords over and around the words, enunciating them with an uncanny grace and power. Good stuff. In a similar vein, the first two minutes or so of \\"Moonchild\\" (pre freak-out) are a gorgeous accoustic rumination, full of imagery and joyous sound. Of course, there's also the eternal \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" which foreshadows Rush, only without the nerdiness. Fripp's brutal, slashing bar chords fuse with McDonald's white-hot trumpet and Giles' thundering drums to form the ideal bed for one of Lake's most uncharacteristic and awesome vocal performances ever. He spits pure venom, snarling the lyrics (a rush of fiery, apocalyptic imagery) with menace and boundless energy. The song then breaks off into an awesome intrumental section, which sees Fripp and McDonald spitting melodies at eachother. It's a lava-spewing jam that dazzles the listener with its polymelodic ferocity, its shape shifting intensity. Crank it up, dude. And then there's the title track, which closes the proceedings with a burst of endearing bombasm (that is almost certainly not a word, but I can't think of a noun form of \\"bombastic\\") and shape-shifting insanity.    So, the end result is one of the coolest debuts of the sixties, a fantastic rock album, an introduction to some really gifted musicians, and the Rosetta Stone of prog. Neat!
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Truly a classic. Loosely based on Shakespeare's \\" The Tempest\\". One of the most intelligent sci-fi films ever lensed. My wife hates the movie, but what does she know ? she's only the love of my life. I got this deluxe package from her for Christmas. It's overpriced , save your money and just buy the movie... Monsters From The Id, Robbie the Robot , and Anne Francis in a mini skirt. Assemble your Klystron Monitor and enjoy.

0743454537|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to read this book!  Years ago I read The Pact but it didn't really do much for me so I was kind of turned off of Jodi Picoult.  Recently though I read The Tenth Circle which I really enjoyed so I follow it by reading Vanishing Acts and Plain Truth...I loved each of these books so I went out and bought My Sisters Keeper and 19 Minutes (I haven't read that one yet though).  My Sisters Keeper was an amazing book that I simply could not put down.  I Loved that the author wrote the book from the first person point of view of so many of the characters, I think it made me really understand where each person was coming from and therefore feel more attached to them.  The ending totally took me by surprise which doesn't really happen to me very often.  The book is written with such insight and compassion-by the end of it I was sobbing as though I were part of the story myself.     I've already started recommending this book to everyone that I know!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is a dystopian future film based on a novel of the same name. The title comes from a recurring phrase found in the Book of Psalms. It was the best film I saw in 2006. Most compelling was the potential Redemption of the Human Race through the Birth of this Child of Man. An allegory for the Second Coming ?.. perhaps. Some of the characters are familiar sterotypes , Clive Owen's laconic loner for one, but the Everyman quality of his performance helps keep us balanced in the story. The film has terrific action sequences and the soundtrack is awesome. The extra DVD features were more or less a big bore.
141694737X|3.0|More of the Same: My 14 month old likes Peek-A-Boo Zoo better (the La Maze book) and also Goodnight Gorilla. But she likes this one as well. It guess we just have too many books on her shelves that involve recognizing and naming the zoo animals. And, there is ALWAYS an elephant and a giraffe involved.
B000J103PC|4.0|This film is great fun! Anne Hathaway shines as Andrea, a college graduate who takes a temporary job until she can become an actual writer, and Meryl Streep is perfect as Miranda Priestly, the Boss from Hell. When Andrea arrives at Runway Magazine in \\"her grandmother's skirt,\\" to the catty remarks of the magazine staff, one thinks of Ugly Betty without the braces, but Hathaway acts the part with so much charm that comparisons with popular TV shows are soon forgotten, especially with lots of zingy fashionista comments: \\"Size 2 is the new 4; size 0 is the new 2.\\" [Andrea's size 6 is actually the new 14!]. When demanding ice-queen Streep removes her glasses and reveals eyes made swollen by the news that her latest husband is divorcing her, her character is rescued from one-dimensionality. The fashion scenes are lovely to look at, as are those set in Paris. And although the story is rather predictable, as Andrea comes to recognize the shallow values of the world into which she has been seduced, the actors are so talented that depth of plot doesn't really matter. As I said at the beginning, the movie is great fun--an enjoyable way to spend an hour or two.  So enjoy; then pass it on to a friend.
0812975219|1.0|This book is like eating chicken salad. Once you have eaten the chicken you are left with a bunch of leaves with mayonnaise on. This book has 2 pages chicken and 260 pages salad.     As the author points out in one of his many ramblings in this book my review here is worth squat because I have no reputation. He instead opts to have his book endorsed by Fortune magazine as \\"One of the smartest books of all time\\". This is the same Fortune magazine that gave Enron \\"Most Innovative Company\\" for six straight years.

Chockablock with cool cars, fast driving, wacky hi-jinx and sexual innuendos, this crowd pleaser from former stuntman Hal Needham is based on an actual car race (which the director and writer both entered driving the ambulance seen in the film).
6305265666|5.0|This movie truly represents an awesome version of the cinderella story...it's such a great chick flick for all the girls to have on a girls night with popcorn and goodies. I loved all of the choice of actors/actresses, they truly fit the charachters well. Good choice in costuming as well, very beautiful costumes and the countryside was absolutely awesome. Go buy it, and have a girls night in your pajamas with lots of goodies. You will be truly happy with this purchase.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|This album is really weak. Unlike most of these reviewers... i really liked the adore and machina albums...and i hold them as two of my favorites. I felt that billy matured in his song writing on those two albums. He wrote very emotional/spiritual lyrics that did not come off sounding childish nor preachy. But they did not get the praise and respect that they deserved... often critisized for being too synthesized and lacking the heavy hitting, down sounding songs that were on such albums as Siamese and Mellon Collie.    Zeitgeist feels like a huge step back. It seems like Billy is going through a mid-life crisis... trying to prove to everybody that he can still \\"rock\\", and that he belongs among rocks top stars. But all this album proves to me is that he is well past his prime. There is a huge lack of quiet songs on this cd... which have been discarded for the sake of \\"rocking\\". The vocals are also really bad on this cd.... and the lyrics are garbage. \\"Starz\\" and \\"Bring the Light\\" consist of billy saying the title over and over.     If you want to keep the memory of what the pumpkins used to be in your head..... dont buy this cd.
B00005JODM|4.0|`Hairspray' is a non-stop, exhilarating song and dance extravaganza.  This exuberant remake of the John Waters' musical is funny, fast, and fabulous. Adam Shankman's direction is appropriately lilting in the right measure, but balanced with social commentary highlights.  Unlike 'Dreamgirls,' there are no Oscar worthy performances, but the production is so fun there doesn't have to be.  The entertainment is winning on every level, and, as for the songs, it never goes limp.      Once again we are transported to the early sixties in Baltimore, where flannel is uniform, Blacks and Whites are segregated, and beehives are in fashion.  The plot is fairly simple:  Overweight teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) wants to break the mold on her favorite TV program \\"The Corny Collins Show\\" (an \\"American Bandstand\\"-like feature) while discovering a more urgent need to end segregation on a show that only sometimes features \\"Negro Night\\".  She gets her big break when teen singing sensation, Link Larkin (Zac Efron) makes advances that bring her to the stage floor.  In the meantime, her success is challenged by the show's program manager, (played with overbearing skill by Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter,  Amber, the show's reigning \\"Miss Teenage Hairspray,\\" a nasty nemesis .  Joining forces with her Afro-American friends, especially Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) and dancer Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), she works for equal time on the dance floor.       `Hairspray' is set as perfect entertainment.  John Travolta provides likable loopiness as Nikki's mother while he dances and cross-dresses his way into our hearts.  The villains are nasty enough, and the sweetness pervades even amongst important demonstrations on key social issues.  When it all comes down to balance, 'Hairspray' fills the bill.
074356619X|5.0|I was greatly influenced by listening to these Cd's sent to me by my old college girlfriend.  I have lost 25 lbs and am still losing more and my outlook has gone back to the positive attitude I had as a younger person.

The movie is also good but not as helpful to me.
1594489505|5.0|With his highly anticipated follow up to the international best seller \\"The Kite Runner\\" (over four million copies in print worldwide), Afghani/American author Khaled Hosseini brings another engrossing story of the trials and tribulations of modern day life in far away Afghanistan. In only his second effort, Hosseini's writing style is again deceptively simple, clean yet captivating as he tells the tale of two women of different generations who are torn by the same issues (a forced marriage, misogyny, brutality, etc.) over nearly three decades of life in this troubled country. It's easy to lose yourself in this book and not realize that while it is ostensibly a tale of a small group of people and their relationships (the brutal husband Rasheed and his two wives; first Mariam, then years later, the younger Laila), it is also a story about the bigger backdrop of politics and war in the never-ending turbulent region. (Their lives are constantly at the mercy of situations brought on by the anti-Soviet forces, the battle for control of Kabul, the modern day Taliban, etc.) It is these exact issues that bring the two women together into the same household and the book chronicles their harrowing ordeal to survive, grow, and somehow love throughout the often brutal and difficult events of this wartorn country over the last thirty years. A Thousand Splendid Suns is easily one of 2007's best books and is already following nicely in the footsteps of Hosseini's first well received release.<br />- Katherine Kelly @ BlogOnBooks

B00005BJ2O|3.0|I LOVE Moulin Rouge...I really do. And, don't get me wrong, this is a fine cd. However, like many others, I was really disappointed to hear songs that were changed or re-recorded for the cd. My favorite part of any song is in El Tango de Roxanne, where Ewan McGregor sings \\"you're free to leave me but just don't deceive me...\\" the second time. However...this was cut from the song. It was a powerful moment people!!! Though, as far as the songs sung by the original cast goes, it was a fairly good album.
0141184884|5.0|Jack Kerouac was intensely alive and his fiery love of life is perhaps best captured in this wonderful book. One of the treasures of American literature, this warm and happy novel is filled with the joy and sadness that Kerouac saw in the world.<br /><br />A novel of this type has the unique ability to capture the living heart of a person, putting it down on the page for us all to discover. Fortunately Kerouac was an unusually kind and warm hearted man, and his strange foolhardy goodness illuminates the pages of this book like a warm glowing candle flame.<br /><br />The main character of the novel is Kerouac himself, but the hero is based on the character of the poet Gary Snyder. One of the wisest of the beats, Snyder has shown us all how to live through his series of fine books. To me, Snyder is a more worthy hero than Neal Cassidy, the character whom Kerouac praises in his most famous book, On the Road.<br /><br />It is not entirely clear why Kerouac chose to fictionalize the characters in his book, calling his hero Japhy Ryder rather than Gary Snyder. One of the most touching moments of the book comes when Kerouac, describing the time when came back to the west coast after visiting his mother, accidentally slips out of character and says that it is \\"Gary\\" who greeted him in the little shack in Marin County.<br /><br />In this book, and in later years, Snyder would have one complaint about Kerouac: he drank too much. This book perfectly captures Kerouac's wonderful spirit, putting it down on the page where it will not be forgotten for many, many years. But there is also a kind eulogistic sadness that hovers over this book. It is hard to understand how such a beautiful spirit would be so quickly snuffed out by an indulgence in alcohol.<br /><br />A huge amount of ink has been spilled denigrating the beats in general, Kerouac whenever possible, and this book in particular. It is extremely ironic to read it now, all these years later, and find it is still so vividly alive, while Kerouac's critics and the books they praised are now usually either hopelessly outdated or entirely forgotten. It is true that Kerouac can at times write like an angel, and can steadily write with intense vividness, and occasionally write complete nonsense. But of course Kerouac knew when he was being silly. He was clearly and perhaps admirably lost in the materialism of 1950's America, but he was no fool.<br />Yet it is not Kerouac's prose that matters, but his amazing, intensely alive spirit. He was rapturously in love with the world and the people in it. Like Melville and Whitman, he had perfect pitch when it came to defining the casual, irreverent style that embodies the best in the American spirit. He is a modern day Ishmael, wandering the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, a refugee from the compulsive materialism of the American Ahabs who crave power so they can wreak their twisted and doomed revenge on their imagined enemies.<br /><br />At the heart of the book lies a meditation on Mahayana Buddhism and the emptiness of this world. Kerouac, who was full of words, sings the praises of the soundless void. And in that emptiness, he finds the compassion which forms the wellsprings of life. That compassion, and Kerouac's intense ode to the joy of living, are found on every page of this sad, beautiful book.he books they praised are now usually either hopelessly outdated or entirely forgotten.

B00005UW7V|5.0|A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a story about a grieving family who has lost their son. At the same time, a person who has built robots comes up with an idea. We all know that robots can't love and can't express human emotion. But what if there was? What if there was a robot that can love, like a child who loves his parents? This is exactly the idea of this scientist. He creates a child, a boy robot (David), who is one of a kind. A robot who can love, and has human emotion. The grieving family then adopts this boy robot, and that's where the real story begins. If you have not seen the film, you may want to skip the rest of this review as alot of the story is revealed.    At first, it's the questions if a human can love a robot. The mother has a hard time adjusting to David, as she knows that he is not a real boy. Then, their real son is healed and he is brought home. Since the void is now lifted, eventually, the mother abondons David by leaving him in the forest alone. You feel sorry for David as he cries out to his mother on why she is abandoning him. He feels that she does not love him, and that he has displeased her. Again, this is something a regular robot cannot do. But this boy robot was created to love, and to be loved. But he feels that he is not getting loved in return. So, he sets out to find a fairy who will turn into him into a real boy so that his mother will love him.     Some may not like the fact that the movie is sort of based on Pinocchio. But this did not bother me at all. After all, this is a young boy so wouldn't a fairy tail be more appropriate?     As the story goes, David ends up being with other robots in a circus-like act where all the old and stray A.I. robots are destroyed in a brutal manner. David watches as the robots are put to their death. A man and his daughter then discover this boy caged with the robots, and the man is shocked to discover that this boy is a machine. He doesn't want to put David in the act, but the leader does it anyway. David hangs on to another robot, who was introduced earlier in the film as a robot who is obsessed with the ladies. The two robots, David and his companion robot, are then prepared to be melted by hot liquid. Your own emotions are once again played with as David cries out for his life. The other robot does not though. And why? It goes back to the beginning: David was created with human emotion. The audience of the act notices this, and they stop the act from being performed. David is now able to continue on his adventure.    The film has a touch of humor to it. This makes the film enjoyable as well as emotional. There are happy times, and then there are sad times. These are great recipies to making a masterpiece.    As the story goes on, David makes many other discoveries along his adventure. We see a underwater Manhattan, then a old underwater amusement park. Then David finnaly finds the fairy. He prays, and prays, and prays for the fairy to turn him into a real boy. But we know better, and the film does not make the fairy tail come to life that easy. 2000 years go by and now everything is ice. Humans are now gone, and David is the only one left with memory of human beings. Other beings, who look like aliens but may not be, read David's mind and see everything that he has seen. As the end of the film arrives, David gets the answer to the question he was asking. Somehow, he is suddenly in his house again, but it's different. And who is there? Why, it's the magic fairy! David gets to spend time with his mother for one day. And then his mother tells him at the end that she has always loved him. This is the final scene where your emotions are tested, as David can no longer see his mother again. Yet, as he sleeps next to his mom, he still dreams and goes to that place where dreams are made.    Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, and every star in the film did an outstanding performance. The effects of the film are amazing and future-like. In conclusion, this film is a masterpiece and it tugs at your heartstrings. It makes you think, it makes you feel, it makes you a part of it. I recommend this film to everyone, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|It's a nice movie, a tear jerker and a nostalgia prompting one.<br />It's about Beatrix Potter, the writer of the children's stories which were my first books as well as my kids.<br />It presents a sympathetic young woman, gifted in both art and nature observation who becomes a patron of the rural community in England and donates her life's work to the National Trust.<br />There is a side line of unfulfilled love and longing, a father who doesn't understand but encourages her and a social ladder climbing mom.<br />But most of the movie is taken up with getting her first book into print and the struggles of a single talented, somewhat shy and reluctant woman writer/artist to show the world what she can do.<br /><br />There are too few people like her in our world, i hope the movie encourages young girls to emulate her and find their own way in the world, not necessarily the accepted and dominant one.<br />worth owning and sitting down with friends to watch and discuss over late night coffee.

Standouts for me are \\"Back at your Door\\", a cruisy, bluesy awesome track, \\"Not Falling Apart\\", \\"Little of your Time\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Until You're Over Me\\" (bonus track on Australian release) \\"Infatuation\\" (another bonus track) and I have to say, \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" has really grown on me too.     There is a song here for everyone to relate to, and a song for every mood. I haven't stopped listening to it since it's release. I love it!    Do yourself a favour and buy it :-)

0930289455|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. Forget everything you know about the Joker from depictions in Batman: The Animated Series and other media. Here, the Joker is not a merry prankster - he's a cold, psychotic killer, and I would not have it any other way. Moore has proved time and again that he is the best writer in the business. Why? Because he isn't afraid to make the medium literary. Reading Moore, you'll find figurative language, subtext, and an unwillingness to simply spoon-feed the reader (that old adage \\"show, don't tell\\").<br /><br />But onto the story itself. Batman goes to Arkham Asylum to confront his old nemesis, The Joker. He informs his foe that their battles always end in a stalemate, and the only way their struggle will ever truly end is if one of them dies. Without spoiling too much of the story, Batman discovers that the person with whom he is speaking is not the \\"real\\" Joker, and his foe is running lose on the streets.<br /><br />This doppleganger Joker is actually an important plot device. Through flashbacks, we witness the origin of the Joker - a failed comedian forced into a life of crime, who ultimately falls into a pool of toxic waste while fleeing from the man who will become his archenemy: Batman. But as we learn from the Joker during one of his confrontations with Batman, his memories are buried under so many layers of psychosis that it becomes impossible to tell if this is his real origin story, or just another fake - much like the impostor at Arkham.<br /><br />This is the brilliance of Moore's story. Repeated readings reward the reader by revealing nuances in the story that weren't immediately apparent. Moore is the writer who introduced me to graphic novels, and, now, he has made me a fan of Batman.<br /><br />One final note: as with all of Alan Moore's works, The Killing Joke is definitely not meant for children. I don't think they would be able to appreciate the complexity of the story, anyway.
0385522401|5.0|Excellent character development with a solid plot and enough suspense to keep you turning the pages.
0553062182|5.0|This book absolutely changed my life. I have been told so many times that I'm just too sensitive. This book explains why there are sensitive souls in the universe and their collective purpose in this world. I went from hating that I was an HSP to knowing how much of a blessing it truly is. Elaine Aron is a delight. She makes you feel special and accepted. Now I'm learning to work with my sensitivity--not suppress it. It has helped me become a better listener and I have gained such insight into why people act the way they do.  I have started recommending this book and CD to everyone that I meet. Not everyone is a sensitive, but I bet after reading this book you will recognize people around you that are. A very heart warming publication.  Thanks Elaine--for sharing your work with us!
0316067598|5.0|As a former Navy Corpsman, my heart goes out to HM1 Luttrell, for what he went thru mentally, physically,and spiritually.  Obviously in my opinion the book is great.  As for this family, we wish Mr. Luttrell and his family the very best for their present and future healing.
0385522401|5.0|You are on your honeymoon at a beach hotel in England. You and your new wife are both virgins. Mr. McEwan's previous book, Saturday, took place on one day. On Chesil Beach essentially takes place in about an hour. As Edward hesitantly approaches his wife Florence for the presumably great experience of the wedding night we get some ominous signals. Florence seems to have an extreme reluctance to be touched. There ensues a flashback about their courtship, and home life. Florence's family was short on touchy feely experiences, and we worry how this will affect her in the intimacy of marriage. Edward often delighted in barroom brawls in his youth, but is now called upon to exercise the utmost patience and gentleness in approaching Florence.<br /><br />On Chesil Beach turns out to be a great novel of suspense. We gradually become certain that the outcome of this evening will have a significant impact on their entire future together. There are no murders, secret agents, spies or assassins in this tale, but you become glued to this book, wondering how it will all end. Although a sexual experience is the essential experience of this novel, it is much more than that. McEwan, as usual, explores in depth the personalities of the two protagonists. This is a short novel, but it is exactly the right length. Oh, and if you are looking for titillating scenes, you won't find them here.<br /><br />This is Ian McEwen at his absolute best.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I loved this seriers. The photography and the reality are beautiful beyond belief. If only they had gotten someone with a voice that would do the series justice.

B000OQF6N6|3.0|No, really. If you are a fan of Gish or Siamese Dream, this album doesn't come close to those masterworks. This is more Billy Tries To Be Black Sabbath. Sure, he can rock out. But none of these songs equal anything from the first two albums. If you want to hear something that sounds like that, you might want to check out Silversun Pickups' \\"Carnavas,\\" which features lots of histrionic guitars and a singer who ranges from wispy to roaring, just like Billy used to -- before he became All Nasal All The Time. Seriously, listen to the Pickups' \\"Lazy Eye\\" which is a helluva tribute to the way SP used to be (the sample on Amazon doesn't do it justice).     Anyway, nice try Billy, but you still are hitting foul balls. Other folks are making better Pumpkins albums than you are these days. Any particular reason that Silversun Pickups and Smashing Pumpkins share initials???
B000P2A256|3.0|This CD is not what I had expected it to be. I enjoy listening to most of the CD but there are some songs that I choose to skip.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|First thing you must know: You don't need to love dogs.  Guess maybe the pet thing was easy to market, but the dogs aren't intrusive and aren't central to the romances involved.  Maybe the \\"dogs\\" who must be loved are the socially awkward folks who could be your only chance to find a sincere and satisfying relationship?    Second thing is: The movie's mixed reviews may seem confusing, but they tell a consistent story.  Some people will like the movie, some won't, and you can probably figure out what sort you'll be.    The positive: \\"Must Love Dogs\\" offers clever verbal humor, usually given to Cusack's character -- who serves it up in his patented rapid-fire, sotto voce delivery -- but occasionally to others (such as the older sister played by Elizabeth Perkins).  Rather than maintain a consistent tone, it plugs bits of absurdity (such as a montage of grotesque suitors and a frantic quest for condoms reminiscent of Cary Grant's screwball comedies) into a framework that is rooted in realism.  The pacing of the romance feels more natural than usual.  Dermot Mulroney plays the sort of womanizer who succeeds in real life: He can turn on the charm but is too self-centered to keep up the act for long.  Diane Lane's school teacher doesn't know why her last marriage fell apart and seems to desire a new one for the wrong reasons: lust, social convention, a fondness for domestic rituals.  But she's right about one thing: John Cusack's craftsman is much more intense than what she was seeking.  He's brooding, defeatist, and so analytical that he cannot maintain a polite conversation -- but with his obsessive-compulsive personality he's also the one who can save her from iterating through failed marriages until she becomes Stockard Channing's desperate chronic divorcee.  He's the one who, like her father (played by Christopher Plummer), would be mourning a wife long after she was gone.    The negative: The movie plugs in lots of romantic-comedy stereotypes (e.g., the cynical playboy nursing a secret emotional wound, the trailer-park trash with the golden heart, the wise and friendly gay couple, etc.)  Sometimes the viewer can tell they're being used as parody, but sometimes the parody (if any) is way too subtle.  Otherwise, judging from the reviews, people disliked this movie because they were hoping for stupid pet antics or those madcap \\"movie segments\\" put together by a writing committee and calculated to make great gags that can be related in 1-2 sentences over the water cooler.  In short, if you're likely to consider the Great Condom Chase to be the movie's crowning achievement, then this movie's a little too high up the food chain.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie was one of the very best chick flicks I have ever seen.  The story line was cute but interesting.  The acting was awesome.  It will be a movie I will watch many times.  In fact several of my girl friends want to come over soon and watch the movie with me.  My husband watched the movie with me and he actually enjoyed it.
B000O178BY|2.0|oh my oh my here we go!!!! Trent throws away innovation and imagination for a little soap box boogie!  Gee, Vedder and Bon Jovi are making a killing at it so why dont I do it?  It is not the message I disagree with it is when a musician who has been so artistic and different regresses back into the depths of simpledom and joins the mighty minions who, in their own mind, think they know something.  It amazes me, it so amazes me how someone who knows nothing of war or politics can sit there and spew for hours and feel like people are going to believe them.  Someone said once of aspiring authors \\"write what you know\\" and I think this needs to apply to musicians as well.  Nothing cool about this CD, just a lot of nonsensical noise that has no purpose.  There is no feeling.  There is no emotion.  There is no direction.  There is no variance or evocation of intelligence.  Rezzy just made something he knew would sell.  There was a day when a concept style album like this had some meat to it, but there is not a strand of meat here, just post spice girls glam.  year zero is named true because this album is worth nothing.  I gave mine to the neighbor kid, he looked pleased, of course he does not know any better, but I be he knows more than Trent.  So sad that someone who gave us PHM, TDS and The Fragile has become a bored, burned out no talent hack.  Retire Trent, before you destroy the zombies who wander this earth with the crud.  2 stars because the CD jacket is cool and it caused a lotta zombies to spend money at corporate stores that Trent whines about so much.  HAHAHA how ironic!  Ya work for da man but then ya bite the hand that feeds ya!  Hey that was a Ratt song wasn't it?  I think Ratt is better than NIN at this point!  This cd is best when eating pears, but not pickles.

Then this whole soap thing, is this a prison movie or is Brad Pitt just wishing he had not cheated on Gwen Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston and thinks that washing his skin with a bar of soap that says fite club on it will wash away his sinning ways?  Norton is a great actor he is one of the best around that is for sure.  I think that this movie needs help though it is boring and you don't need to be in a club to fight and kik someone's azz in a new york city basement people!!!!  Ridiculous premise that does not hold water, or if it does it is like any bladder, soona or lata it give outta!!
1577312082|5.0|This is a must read for people who are seeking spiritual enlightenment.  For the first time in 60 years I am beginning to live in the Present, not the past or future.    Most people do not realize they are thinking all the time.    Compulsively, one thoght after the other.  That is not realized until you try not to think of anything.  Focus on your breathing, as in meditation.   This book and audio book will not appeal to those not ready.  Read a few pages before purchasing it.    If you say to yourself,\\"What the heck is he talking About?\\"  Don't buy it.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Guys, is there anyway we can Get the Heads at Paramount to Bring this show back ?  I was not a T v  guy when this show was introduced; however, I have  watched in re-runs (Esp. the HD episodes) and have found this show to be brilliant. It was killed off because in America it was  just a bad time for the show. This of course would be unprecedented ( bringing a show from the Ashes after 3 years) but I feel with the right support and enough fanfare it could happen. The Actors who were featured in Enterprise ( with the exception of Ms. Blalock ) Found a special place in their heart for this show and  would jump to be part of \\"Enterprise\\" again be it through movie or a \\"Correctly\\" done feature film. In the \\"out there\\"  that we call the world we need a  \\"Star trek\\" show of some kind ,why not a  version that was vastly popular but never had the chance to flourish? Let me know what u guys think , I think anything is possible.  And by the way The DVD is fantastic
1416523359|5.0|Lisey (rhymes with CeCe) Landon was a writer's wife: she stood in the background supporting her beloved Scott Landon, who was a world-famous writer, revered by academics and casual readers alike.  Scott had one heck of an imagination; just where that imagination came from was a secret known only to him, and the recesses of Lisey's mind.  But now Scott is two years in the grave, and Lisey is going through the work he left behind--unfinished stories, notes, and the such.  When a professor shows up, asking for Scott's unfinished work, Lisey isn't surprised; she turns him away, writing him off as just another obsessive fan.  When another man calls, threatening to hurt her, she takes police action, but thinks nothing of it.  The dead cat in the mailbox, however, is another matter...<br /><br />But Lisey isn't alone in this.  Somehow, in some way, Scott is with her.  He is dead, but he seems to have predicted these events.  You see, Scott wasn't your ordinary writer; Scott was special.  He had an imagination stemming from the depths of a dream pool, a secret place where we all fish for ideas.  And Lisey will have to take a trip to Scott's pool, a trip that will bring her closer than she ever imagined to her dead husband.  That is, of course, if she isn't already too late.<br /><br />Confused?  You don't know the half of it.  \\"Lisey's Story\\" is another complex, haunting, twisting tale from Stephen King.  You probably won't know what's going on until the last couple hundred pages or so...and that's just the way King wants it.  \\"Lisey\\" kicks off with a bang, and never lets up, whether it's living in the past or the present.  This is a heart-tugging, gut-wrenching tale of love and loss, of personal redemption and survival.  It is a horror story like only King could write it, because it isn't really a horror story at all--it's a love story, a nice love story that happens to feature some supernatural elements.  \\"Lisey's Story\\" will break your heart and leave you wanting more.  King is a master at this kind of thing.  But hell, you already know that.at this kind of thing.  But hell, you already know that.
0895260131|5.0|This book is well written and well researched. It is bold enough to make the truth claims that it makes. I especially like the chapter on the Islamic contribution to civilization and science - or lack thereof. The overview of the crusades and pointing out that they were in fact a reaction to the Muslim crusades that were launched against Christendom is a bold and courageous step in the midst of the politically correct whitewash history that is now being taught to students. The conclusion is that if there were no muslims their would not have been any crusades in the first place is inferred from this text. I have used extracts from it in teaching my history lessons. Keep up the good work. Somebody must have the guts to speak the truth in love.
0446310786|5.0|The most amazing thing about this book is that even though it is fiction written more than forty years ago about events that took place more than seventy years ago, it is as relevant today as it was during the Civil Rights struggles of the late 1950's. One need only to read about the Jena Six to realize that we have not come as far as we might like to think.<br /><br />The cover of the book says this is a story of \\"growing up\\" and \\"human dignity\\" and this is true. Harper Lee described it as a love story and this is true as well. But it is also a story of hatred and not just racial hatred. It is the story of the hatred those who are more refined feel for those below them; the hatred of those who are poor for those who are even poorer; the hatred of the poorest whites for the blacks who they feel are below them. The lowest white man in town, who is constantly drunk, lives on welfare, mistreats his children and forces them to pick through the town dump for food still expects to believed over the word of a hard-working, honest black man. And when someone refuses to believe his lies, his anger knows no bounds. It is a story of not just racial prejudice but class prejudice as well.<br /><br />But beneath all this hatred is a story of love and innocence and of growing up. Growing up deep in the South during the heart of the Depression, Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill learn a lesson about the hearts of men, that although there is darkness in men's souls that there is also a brightness that can be reached.<br /><br />Harper lee has written a beautiful and believable story. None of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, rather they all feel like real people. When Scout and Jem are welcomed at Calpurnia's church, when Atticus stands in front of the sheriff's office to protect Tom, when Jem must read to Mrs. Dubose as punishment for destroying her garden, when Scout, Jem, and Dill try to coax Boo Radley out of his house... each of these events build a complex story of childhood and innocence and losing innocence. At the end of the story, Scout says, \\"Atticus, he was real nice...\\" and Atticus replies, \\"most people are, Scout, when you finally see them,\\" and that is the ultimate moral of this story.and innocence and losing innocence. At the end of the story, Scout says, \\"Atticus, he was real nice...\\" and Atticus replies, \\"most people are, Scout, when you finally see them,\\" and that is the ultimate moral of this story.
1400063515|4.0|Since Amazon has chased me for a review, I will make some preliminary comments.  I have yet to finish the book, although I am in the last part of the book.    Yes, it is enjoyable reading, but I would quarrel about one thing.  I think it is helpful to have some background in statistics to get his most important points about the tyranny of the Bell Curve.  I was a bit puzzled by his comment that he did not understand why the early workers on statistics referred to it as the study or errors.  Having studied physics in college, what you learn in the laboratory is that, in physics, measurement is not a precise science.  No matter what you measure, you will get different results each time you measure it.  In short, you are always making errors.  To determine the closest approximation of \\"truth\\" you need statistical tools.    However, his point is valid.  The point of the study of errors is not to make predictions.  And this is where the book has enormous value.  It gets you to thinking about the errors of assuming that \\"past performance is a good indicator of future performance.\\"  His selection of 9/11 as being an illustrative Black Swan event is useful and valid.  Because it happened people immediately assume it will happen again.  Let's close the barn doors to keep the horses from leaving, even if there are no more horses in the barn.  His point is not to say that a future terrorist attack will not happen, just the futility of trying to predict when.    His points about seeking confirming evidence being not evidence of confirmation is an excellent point.  A lot of scientists should write that one hundred times on their blackboards, especially the \\"vast majority of scientists\\" working on Global Warming.  Politicians might take note, except I fear most are lawyers who studied law because they were hopelessly disabled when it came to quantitative analyses.  Most of them won't get it, but should.  The fact that hindsight is 20-20 does not mean foresight ever should, or could, be.  Too many Black Swans lurking out there.    So, for those who are inclined to self-examination and are interested in thinking critically about how we think, this is a great book.  I cannot tell you how many people I have badgered to read it.    (Note, I very, very rarely award 5 stars to anything.)

1590171993|5.0|It's been a few weeks since I finished reading \\"Stoner\\" and I am still talking about it to friends.  I had never heard of \\"Stoner\\" before reading the recent article in the New York Times about it.  Within the straight forward writing style of John Williams is the beautiful poetry that can be found in everyday events, simple descriptions of how light changes during the day, silent triumphs or hurts that accumulate in our lives.  I'm so glad I stumbled across John Williams' novel and would highly recommend reading it.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I won't bore you with another synopsis of this film.   Suspence from the start...to finish. Violence a little over the top but a least it's well done.    Considering that there are not that many good films out there...well worth seeing.  Many women seem to like this film. Perhaps it's the star Mark Wahlberg.

B000KRNG5E|4.0|After the success of SUSPIRIA , Dario Argento (Master of Horror) presents INFERNO, a journey into darkness. Rose Elliot (Irene Miracle) reveals the dark secrets of \\"The Three Mothers\\" (Mater Tenebrarum, Mater Suspiriorium, & Mater Lacrimarum) written by architect Varelli and discovers that the source of all evil resides in the building she lives in. Aware of her discoveries she mysteriously disappears. Mark Elliot (Leigh Mc Closkey) travels to New York City in search of his missing sister Rose only to unravel the mysteries she set out to find in an inferno nightmare. Considered the semi-sequel to SUSPIRIA there are many similarities but INFERNO seems more watered down and disjointed. Leigh Mc Closkey takes on Jessica Harper's character from SUSPIRIA and the ending stands in the footsteps of SUSPIRIA. Still there are many elements to distinguish INFERNO as a master piece. Dario Argento is the master of lighting, creating an atmosphere he knows best, setting the trend for other directors. Alida Valli makes her appearance but the impact isn't as strong as in SUSPIRIA as I think to be one of her finest roles. Keith Emerson from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer does a superb soundtrack.
0316067598|5.0|I've got a ton of American military books - both biographical and historical narrative - and this book is the best.  It is rare to be able to read a book by a combatant who was there, while the war is still ongoing and the outcome unknown.  This book does more to expose the flaws in America's political process and the outright antagonism of the media than anything I've read to date.  Not hypothetical musings, but an actual event where Amercian soldiers died as a direct result of men and women safely protected on American soil creating war policies based on world opinion and a misguided media conglomerate only interested in destoying our country and pandering to the enemy.    Marcus Luttrell, I salute your bravery and courage, and may God bless you for your selfless dedication to our country.  If only our men and women in Congress had a tiny sliver of your patriotism, this war would be over and won.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|One of my biggest pet peeves of soundtracks is when they put the music out of order from the movie, as they did with this case. If I wanted it out of order then I would just hit the shuffle button on my CD player.     Nicholas Hooper's score to Order of the Phoenix is improved to that of Patric Doyle's score in the Goblet of Fire but it still is nowhere near that of John William's Harry Potter scores. Hooper's music is disappointing in that it doesn't capture the mood of the movie like it should. Umbridge's theme is peppy because she may look nice, but it doesn't hold that she is downright evil. We don't feel Harry's angst as he is entering the prime of his teenage years. The music wasn't as complex as I thought it would have been and overall, it just didn't seem very \\"Harry Potter-like.\\"     I have heard that Hooper is set up for Half-Blood Prince and I hope that he makes the music far superior to that of Order of the Phoenix in capturing the mood, which will be a difficult task as Half-Blood Prince is the darkest of the books and the darkest of the movies so far.

B000PFUA9G|5.0|Admittedly, I am a big fan, but this album is great. Paisley's keen wit shows through in songs like \\"Ticks\\" and \\"Still a Guy.\\" And he doesn't forget to woo us with some love and love-lost songs as well. Great album!
B000001FDK|5.0|This was my first album in record form.  My preteen daughter now loves it and has taken it over and choreographed every song with her friends.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Rock Steady by No Doubt is a mixture of good tracks with some rather fluffy, insubstantial, not too creative stuff.  The album begins with some catchy, energetic tunes:  Hella, Hey Baby, Making Out.  Underneath it All is a slower, crooning tune.  Thereafter, the album doesn't really have much punch.  Detective is kinda catchy, but also silly.  Don't Let Me Down and In My Head and light and bouncy.  Platinum Blonde Life has a good rock edge and is a good tune to have toward the end for some balance.  Overall, a very listenable album, but doesn't register too much impact on the listener.  Tragic Kingdom was more forceful.
0316067598|5.0|This book had me in tears.  For the loss of 19 great heroes and their families.  I thought it was well written and a superb read.  I also listened to the audio version but since it was abridged I had to buy the hardcover book as well.

B0000039QA|5.0|With 2 discs, Life After Death gives the listener a lot of material by Biggie.  Some reviewers criticize this as having some weaker stuff and annoying guest appearances, but I think that's just a function of having a bigger album.  Some stuff inevitably will not be as good as the rest.  And I think the guest appearances are fine.  Lil Kim spews off a foul mouth on one track, but that's what she does in her own stuff.  Anyway, there's lots of great raps on her.  The album's a bit slicker and more produced, lacking some of the edge of Ready to Die, but I think things as a whole work very well.  While maybe not quite as awesome, on a song by song basis, as Ready to Die, this album definitely has enough quality material for the 5 stars.  The best raps:    Hypnotize  Kick in the Door  I Love the Dough  Mo Money Mo Problems  Another  Going Back to Cali  The World is Filled
0385338902|5.0|Twenty-nine years old Doug Parker cannot believe how fast life can change when his spouse Hailey dies in a plane crash.  However, his grief is so great he struggles to leave their home and he writes about it in his magazine column so that many feel for him as a young widower raising a teenage stepson, Russ with big issues since his mom died.  He wants to hide in his grief cocoon, but instead he becomes a media darling as everyone wants Doug on their show.<br /><br />However, his woes turn uglier when his pregnant twin sister Claire leaves her husband and moves in with Doug and Russ.  Her plan is to force her brother to move on with his life.  Local females sympathize with Doug while a few want to be the one who take him out of his depression starting with the wife of his best friend, the strippers he meets, and the guidance counselor who worries about both males residing in the Parker home.<br /><br />This is a well written character study of a young man grieving the unexpected death of his wife after just a couple years together.  Doug is an interesting protagonist as he deals with issues ranging from guilt to loneliness to failing Russ, who has his own problems.  The outside world wants in to his fishbowl adding more troubles to a troubled soul.  Jonathan Tropper provides a strong tale that looks at the grief process from the differing perspective of a man under thirty unable to cope.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000KFTWIG|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best rap albums EVER.  It was hugely influential to boot.  Biggie's raps feature great storylines backed up by great beats.  The raps are lengthier, they're quite involved and the listener has to actually listen to the lyrics, not just passively hear fluff.  Biggie's delivery and flow are excellent too; there's just something about his voice and cadence that works with this material.  The raps look into the struggles and dangers faced by people on the street and also by Biggie himself.  Violence and the threat of violence are everywhere, tho not glamorized, and characters in the raps meet bad ends.  The title, Ready to Die, takes on a grim character in light of Biggie's early death by gunfire.  The absolutely best raps of all the good ones on here are:    Things Done Changed  Gimme The Loot  Juicy - great flow to it  Suicidal Thoughts - chilling recording of a call placed by Biggie to friend (Puff Daddy) about contemplating suicide.

B00005QDW5|5.0|This two disc Floyd compilation is a great buy.  It's an excellent overview of Floyd's hits, showcasing their weird but intriguing sounds and lyrics.  This collection is particularly good for people who like Floyd, but aren't such hard-core fans as to have all of the individual albums.  The obvious hits from the radio [Brick in the Wall, Hey You, Money, Learning to Fly] are here, as well as lesser-played but still great stuff, like Arnold Layne and Fletcher Memorial Home, and when the Tigers Broke Free, which is a heartfelt reflection on losing a father to war.

The movie sheds light on the intrigues of the Spanish court, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of Spanish (and European) History.

I second their opinions, but like Chicago something was lost when it went to the big screen.    First the two best ensemble numbers were removed.  Mamma, I'm a Big Girl Now, which clearly shows the conflict between the Mothers and Daughters is shared; and second \\"The Big Dollhouse\\" with some of the funniest humour in the entire musical.    Second, the seduction of Wilbur Turnblad was very funny, but could easily have been cut and the movie would have lost nothing also, the relationship between Tracy and Little Inez which was removed in this film but in the musical and in the original film  sets up Tracy's concern for the predjudice she seeks to thwart.    Summary, very well done and I hope Hollywood does not get their hands on Wicked or Spamalot.
B000NRPJEW|4.0|Alatriste brings to the screen the story of a Spanish mercenary who made a name for himself fighting in the wars in the Netherlands in the first half of the 17th Century.   The film brings to the screen several stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: Firstly, Captain Diego Alatriste, and his turbulent life, secondly (and to a much lesser extent), Spain's involvement in the Netherlands and its steady decline, and thirdly the religious wars between Catholics and Protestants.    The movie sheds light on the intrigues of the Spanish court, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of Spanish (and European) History.   In addition, we get a taste (though a very light one) of 17th Century European politics.  Moreover, we get to see and hear about the infamous Spanish Holy Inquisition.   Viggo Mortensen (!!!), and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!  The setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!  In a nutshell, though slow at times and difficult to follow, Alatriste will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!
B00005JPAO|4.0|I admire what the filmakers attempted to do with this movie.   Stephen Frears's style is very matte, no gloss, which was the right medium to depict the restrained, modestly upright lifestyle of the royals.  You can't help but feel the stark difference between their demeanor and that of their subjects.  This is exacerbated by both side's reaction to the death of Lady Di.  The royals desired a private burial for Diana whereas the nation wished for a public one since she was considered the \\"People's Princess\\".  Throughout the movie you find yourself trying to identify with points of view and then figuring out which side was truly right to begin with.  Of course, none of this is resolved on screen, but the resulting events are well played out in a sort of denoument of compromise.       While Helen Mirren was spot on playing Queen Elizabeth, I felt Michael Sheen was also deserving of an Oscar for his portrayal of Tony Blair, handling his first official crisis after just stepping in office (ironically foreshadowing a real-life future one much larger than this).  Tony Blair, much like the audience, is caught somewhere in the middle, trying to understand both sides and come up with a resolution that allows both to save face.      This is definitely a worthwhile movie, but for those who prefer something a little more action packed, I'd advise you to skip this.
B00006RINF|4.0|This is overall my favorite Lacuna CD.  I first purchased Unleashed Memories and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound.  However, Comalies is more of what I am looking for in a great band.  I really appreciate the heavy metal sound continually contrasted with the beautiful high pitched gothic vocals.  Cristina's voice quality is much better on this album and she hits more of the long drawn out high notes.   Comalies overall has more of this gothic emotional sound then either of Lacuna's other 2 CDs.       The album opens with \\"Swamped\\" and I can't help but be reminded of Cirque du Soleil music from \\"La Nuoba\\".  It has a haunting voice and smooth tight rock.  It is probably the most beautifully down gothic songs.  It is pretty mainstream and a good song to hook other listerners to Lacuna Coil.       Then there is Daylight Dancer, this song just has a smooth pummel that mixes both vocalists with a melodic metal undertone. Cristina's voice is definately the centerpiece on this track, but Andrea's voice comes in as back up vocals and isn't too overpowering.      My 2 favorite tracks are \\"Tight Rope and \\"Unspoken\\".  \\"Tight Rope\\" again has that heavy gothic haunting sound and this song really showcases Cristina's voice.  Andrea's voice is just ok and this song would probably be 5 stars if it was all Cristina or had stonger male lyrics. \\"Unspoken\\" is one of those songs that just has a catchy melody.  I don't think there really is anything special, some good rock, intersting lyrics but a really stong melody that you find pulling you in.
0142406112|4.0|\\"Stormbreaker\\" by Anthony Horowitz, is neither a masterpiece of writing nor a great, character-driven novel. But then, I wasn't expecting it to be. I was expecting a good, exciting thriller, and that's what I got.<br /><br />Alex Rider has just received news of his uncle's suspicious death. He doesn't believe for a moment that Ian Rider didn't wear a seatbelt in his car accident -- his uncle was notoriously cautious. But he never guessed the truth -- that his uncle was a spy for the British government and was killed by a hit man working for the other side. His last mission is a desperate one, though, and MI6, the agency he worked for, has now commissioned Alex to finish it.<br /><br />At times heartily implausible (like the end -- harpooning a plane? And managing not to fall as you're dragged by harpoon gun into the sky?), this novel is still pretty good. As I said before, it's no masterpiece, but again: it doesn't intend to be. It's supposed to be a light, easy, fast-paced, exciting read, and it does it quite well.<br /><br />One thing, though, that really bothered me, was the treatment of Alex's reaction to his uncle's death. I don't care how distant your guardian is, you don't just \\"get over\\" the death of the person who has been your parent for fourteen years, especially not when you find out he was murdered. Alex even meets the murderer himself, in the end, and doesn't so much as get angry! I thought that this was probably the most unrealistic part of the whole book (even more than the harpoon-gun incident.)<br /><br />A good thriller. 4 stars.<br /><br />Rating: A toss-up between Average and Very Good

B00005JMAH|4.0|Hermione nearly kills Draco!  Harry zaps Snape!  Ron's pet rat is a Deatheater!  These are just some of the surprises in the 3rd film installation of Harry Potter.  The overarching story again is Harry's family, specifically the return of his uncle, Sirius Black.  Background stories are also abound, such as Hermione's excellence in school, Hagrid's new pet, and several new professors at Hogwarts, one of which was close to Harry's parents, Remus Lupin.  The series has a new director, Alfonso Cuaron, who has a long history of adapting books into movies, such as Great Expectations and A Little Princess.  Cuaron here turns the Potter films towards a darker, more sinister mood.  How this movie got a PG rating is still a wonder to me.  Again the special effects are wonderful, as is the dialog, action scenes, cinematography and manifestations of magic.  All in all, a great movie.    Just one question; if there is so much magical powers between Harry and the various wizards at Hogwarts, why can they not cure his eyes so he does not have to wear glasses?
0060763280|5.0|This is the latest in a bunch of books I've been reading in the past year to improve my financial skills. While I've been reading up on more solid things such as investment, managing the money I already have, and other financial planning-related topics, it's also good now and then to read a book that addresses the attitudes I have towards money, which do directly affect how I handle it.     I found this to be an incredibly valuable book for that reason. Eker doesn't tell you how to invest in real estate or play the stock market--in fact, he doesn't even give you specific suggestions for what to do with your money. What he does sdo is address how you think and feel about money, and gives a holistic approach to your finances.     Much of the book is spent examining specific attitudes that can make or break you financially. For example, Eker shows how people who are financially successful tend to look at problems from a solution-oriented viewpoint, instead of getting bogged down in the problems themselves. He strongly advocates avoiding the victim mentality that often leads people to do nothing but complain about their situation rather than apply more creative thinking--the biggest offenders are blame (someone else), justifying (why you are where you are, and still not doing anything about it) and complaining (again, instead of doing something about it). Much of the book serves to undo these three components of the victim complex in relation to finances. Additionally, he goes to great length to demonstrate how the attitudes we were raised with affect how we view money--if we're raised with parents who act as if money is evil, then our attitudes are likely to be the same.    The author clearly uses neurolinguistic programming as a tool for undoing these harmful attitudes. He talks about anchoring and modeling, and shows how they can be incredibly effective. Those who are familiar with NLP should find some very familiar material here. He also includes a number of affirmations and exercises designed to help imprint the reader with the idea that s/he can succeed and overwrite the bad conditioning that keeps hir in the same old patterns.    However, this isn't a pie in the sky kind of \\"If you think it, it will happen\\" book. He's quite honest about the fact that finances are hard work, especially if you do as he recommends and become self-employed. The bigger the outcome, the bigger the risk, and he tells stories of how inbetween successes he worked minimum wage jobs. However, he also explains that the people who are successful are the ones that learn to bounce back from setbacks.     Probably the single most important piece of advice Eker gives is on page 68: \\"I know it may be hard to believe, but you always get what you want--what you subconsciously want, not what you say you want\\". The problem with books like these is that people look at the surface of the problem, but not the iceberg underneath. Used as intended, the material and exercises in this book will serve to start uprooting some of the stuff under the surface that can help deprogram the internal saboteur.     Obviously no single book can fix all your problems. However, if you're just getting interested in finances, or if you think money is all evil and bad (and then complain about how you're always broke) this is an excellent starting point.

B000002LK1|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Depeche Mode got great hits and a rising fame across the world with their past albums, but this one is at the top of their career! Apart from being a total hit it also possesses a music composition extremely creative and enjoyable.<br /><br />The album is certainly a point of reference when talking about Depeche Mode; at least three tracks of this album will come to your mind when someone talks about them. The album is very dark but also mature and comfortable, applying techno-dance arrangements never seen in other synthpop albums. It has the perfect moods: complex, delicate, rythmical, agressive, dark, just perfect!. When it comes to the tracks each one of them fits in perfect harmony with the album, like the famous and my personal favorite Enjoy The Silence, which also has a music video that causes impact because of the landscapes, the also famous and controversial Personal Jesus (not related with any satanic aspect), the all time favorite Policy Of Truth (extremely loved by other reviewers as I noticed), the deep, mature and touchy but refreshing tracks World In My Eyes and Waiting For The Night,and the meaningfully comprehensible tracks Sweetest Perfection (in my opinion my least favorite), Blue Dress, Halo and Clean. The tracks' tempo is also slower than past works, maybe with the exception of Enjoy The Silence. The electronical arrengements of each track are very thoughtful and intelligently composed (not like other non sense electronic materials of other bands).<br /><br />David Gahan's voice is much more trained and heavy as always; Gore and Fletcher musicianship is maybe the best in their careers. Talking about Wilder he did so much unforgetable contributions to this cd to the point of being recognized his extremely talented musical genius.<br /><br />In conclussion this album is a techno-dance serious and dark work, also easy to comprehend and very accessible, which explodes the best of Depeche Mode in every aspect, my greatest recommendations.

B000HOJBMW|4.0|Initially I was rather dismissive of this, calling it Radiohead's weakest album. Things have changed since then, though, and I now have more of an appreciation for the record's emotional range. While it's true that this is a very similar album to Kid A, and it's true that album's detractors will probably not have much love for Thief either, this does display more range than either of its predecessors: nothing as frenetic as \\"Sit Down. Stand Up. (Snakes and Ladders.)\\" or as genuinely threatening as \\"A Wolf at the Door (It Girl. Rag Doll.)\\" would have found its way onto Kid A (Kid A is very good, of course, but not a very emotional album - rather, it was even colder and more impersonal than OK Computer), while the total shift in \\"2 + 2 = 5. (The Lukewarm.)\\" from an icy techno piece to a charged-up rocker is surprising, in a good way - indeed, \\"2 + 2\\" is one of the album's several high points, along with the ethereal, ambient \\"Sail to the Moon (Brush the Cobwebs out of the Sky.)\\", which for some reason reminds me of the Doors' \\"Moonlight Drive\\" - don't ask why, I honestly don't know; as well as the organic, acoustic-based \\"Go to Sleep. (Little Man Being Erased.)\\" Some of it is rather annoying, yes, like the harsh electronics found on \\"Backdrifts (Honeymoon is Over.)\\", or the rather stale techno-rockers \\"Where I End and You Begin (The Sky is Falling in.)\\" or \\"The Gloaming (Softly Opening our Mouths in the Cold.)\\", but that's okay because opposing them are songs like the genuinely scary, piano-centric \\"We Suck Young Blood (Your Time is Up.)\\", which recalls the favorable elements of OK Computer, specifically \\"Exit Music (for a Film)\\", without seeming like a pathetic imitation, the worldbeat experiment \\"There There. (The Boney King of Nowhere.)\\", which features a guitar that sounds rather like a saxophone, the slightly funky (!!) \\"A Punchup at the Wedding. (No No No No No.)\\", the dire, slightly bombastic, very distorted heavy rock of \\"Myxomatosis (Judge, Jury and Executioner)\\"; \\"Scatterbrain (As Dead as Leaves)\\", which fuses techno with the Bends-era sound; and my personal favorite, the already discussed \\"A Wolf at the Door (It. Girl. Rag Doll.)\\". A few complaints, however: I already said I didn't like a few of these songs, plus this isn't a big stylistic shift from Kid A or Amnesiac, so if you've been using Thom Yorke's picture as a dartboard since 2000 (or if you never liked the band in the first place), I don't think this will convert you. Finally, the lyrics are sometimes inaudible over all the electronics, which is a shame because the booklet reveals they're quite interesting. There's enough music here to make this one of Radiohead's better albums, though, and I have to give the anti-consumerist cover art my full support.er)\\"; \\"Scatterbrain (As Dead as Leaves)\\", which fuses techno with the Bends-era sound; and my personal favorite, the already discussed \\"A Wolf at the Door (It.

B00005N9CV|5.0|About half this album is done in bossa nova rhythm.  Diana Krall is clearly comfortable in this idiom.  She also echoes back to Julie London.  First rate!
B000002UR7|2.0|Had you told me in 1993 that Radiohead would go on to great success with critically acclaimed albums like The Bends and especially the masterpiece OK Computer (and its near-masterpiece follow-up, Kid A), I would have probably backed away from you as fast as possible. Most of Pablo Honey is rather poor guitar rock - How Do You? might be the worst song the group ever recorded, a song with pathetic lyrics, while songs like Prove Yourself and I Can't both are poor imitation U2. While Radiohead's U2 influence would prevail throughout their career, it's especially emphasized here: even two of the stronger songs (Anyone Can Play Guitar; Stop Whispering) remind me a lot of a certain massively popular Irish rock band.<br />Now there's one really impressive song here, and of course it's Creep, the group's first hit, the song that unfairly got them branded as one-hit wonders before The Bends came along and shut everybody up. While the song has its detractors, even from the Radiohead fanbase, I really like it. I first heard it as a preschooler and I remember it did a combination of scaring and offending me (keep in mind Beauty and the Beast also scared me at this time) - the falsetto, guitar scratches and lyrics scared me, while the line \\"what the hell am I doing here?\\" (keep in mind that I only heard the radio edit, the one free of the F-Bomb), and \\"I wish I was special\\" offended me - again, I was in preschool, and if any preschooler was caught repeating I wish I was special they would have been given the \\"everyone's special in their own special way\\" lecture. Anyway, nowadays I quite enjoy it. Thom's falsetto in the bridge is VERY effective, the dynamic shifts are clever, the guitar scratches just RULE, and it's the most melodic song about self-loathing I've ever heard. And while it's tempting to dismiss the lyrics as angsty whining, the truth is they do an efficient job of portraying a person who is messed-up, possessive, neurotic, and well... creepy. And the use of the f-bomb adds a lot to the song with just one word: the radio edit (with a clumsy \\"you're so very special\\" lyric) makes it seem like mere self-pity, whereas the \\"you're so f***in' special\\" gives it more of a \\"well, I suck, but so do you\\" feel - a double put-down, kind of Dylanesque. Still, it's nothing Nirvana hadn't done before.<br />Now if everything on this album was as good as Creep, we'd have a fine album on our hands. Alas, that is not the situation. I already discussed my dislike of How Do You?, Prove Yourself and I Can't, and most of it's about as \\"good\\" as those: I doubt many people have fond memories of overly commercial rockers like Ripcord or Vegetable, for example; Thinking About You changes the sound up (folk-rock! Ooh!), but in truth is a pathetic song as well. I suppose You is an okay precursor to The Bends' sound (though not quite as good as that album's best), and both Lurgee and Blow Out are enjoyable if forgettable and unspectacular. So there's one great song (Creep), two good ones (Anyone Can Play Guitar; Stop Whispering), some okay ones (Blow Out; You; Lurgee). But this is by far Radiohead's weakest album. (I know I gave Hail to the Thief a lower rating, but that one's grown on me, and I think I'll edit my review of it sometime soon). Each of their later efforts is far stronger.ds a lot to the song with just one word: the radio edit (with a clumsy \\"you're so very special\\" lyric) makes it seem like mere self-pity, whereas the \\"you're so f***in' special\\" gives it more of a \\"well, I suck, but so do you\\" feel - a double put-down, kind of Dylanesque.

Long, continuous action takes lasting 10 minutes or more is the style, and it is thoroughly intense and immersive.

I cannot add much to the other reviews except to say that the reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is bc. the lengthy version of Nine Feet Underground is not nearly as good as the live version on the CD and DVD release \\"Live in Nottingham\\" which, although recorded decades later in a reunion concert, has more exceptional jamming, by both David Sinclair - on electric organ and James Hastings on flute and sax - than on the original. Still one of the top ten best prog rock albums.

076792603X|5.0|I bought this book because I had read the prequal [[ASIN:1416524797 Angels & Demons]]. I will admit that at first I was trying to stay away from The DaVinci Code due to all the media hype, but after reading \\"Angels & Demons\\" I was hooked. When I read the prequal, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't imagine many of the places and artifacts mentioned in the book because I had not been to Rome or the Vatican. When I discovered this Illustrated version of the DiVinci Code, I decided to buy it. I was amazed at the illustrations and actual photographs. I got a better understanding of where Langdon was and what he was describing. I especially loved that the places Langdon visited and many of the artifacts he saw were something that I can see and visit if I were in Paris as well.<br /><br />The story itself was written in such a way, that for me, it was difficult to decide what was fiction and what was historical fact. I know that the idea of the relationship of Jesus and Mary of Magdalane has been a debate throughout history, but in the story, it sounded as if it was an actual fact. I was able to enjoy it because I am not a religious fanatic or a die-hard catholic. I was able to enjoy the possible history of Jesus and Mary and the possibility that the two may have been married and had a child together. The story does lend itself for discussion on the matter. It was also fun trying to solve the puzzles presented to Robert and Sophie in trying to find the \\"San Greal\\" or Holy Grail.<br /><br />I think that those who will enjoy the book are those who enjoy riddles, history, mystery and religious debate. I purposely read this book before seeing the movie and was not dissappointed when I saw the movie.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Now I am going to say right off the bat, I am that person who can predict pretty much the ending of anything.  I mean, I knew five minutes into \\"The Usual Suspects\\" who was Kaiser...but I digress.  I have noticed in the lower end of the reviews that there are things said like its boring.  I am curious as to why you would say that, I mean I usually find that when people say something is boring, it is because they don't understand it.  I know about Tesla, long before this movie came along, I know about the fact that they sealed off his lab when he died and how Edison tried to destroy him.  I even know that was off the beaten path and that most people didn't understand him but that among other things, namely that he was a genius, makes him cool.<br />Now, this is the kind of movie that is for the thinking audience, I saw the Illusionist and let me say its a good film, a fairy tale, but a good movie nonetheless, Paul G. is awesome in it.  But its for the not so thinking audience, its something soft and sweet to make you feel all warm and fuzzy.  This movie I saw on a Friday afternoon after work and it was probably one of the better afternoons I have spent in a movie theatre.  I mean the comment about revenge was kind of special.  If movies are influncing you to do things maybe you should stay away from the multiplex.  This movie is about living in this time where science was magic, if someone had told you in 1880 that you would be able to sit in front of a screen and send letters to your friends over a wire, you would have been amazed but its something that is commonplace to us.  There's nothing magic about email, but this was something that would have been magical to our ancestors.<br /> I agree with one comment I read about \\"Le Comte du Monte Cristo\\"  that was very true its one of those books that everyone knows, although I have yet to see someone film a version with the real ending from the book in it.  Revenge is something that we like to see obtained but even in that case there was a reckoning for it and there was morality too.<br />This movie is amazing, and even though I knew the heart of the trick, I still found it interesting to watch it unfold.  Oh, it a great one.  Its on my top one hundred movies ever.<br />By the way, I notice that someone said that the acting wasn't that good.

The picture of Afghanistan is more modern than his last novel and the picture is very grim.  The ending is uplifting in its own way.

074356619X|5.0|This book reminded me of what I instinctively knew and practiced as a child but had forgotten along the way to becoming an adult.  It reminded me of what I had learned and forgotten through the practice of my relgious faith and through various books I had read.      Now at age 50 I am thankful to have rediscovered the \\"law of attraction\\" and the power of \\"setting intention\\".  I continue to be amazed by the life events and opportunities as they unfold.        My one criticism is that the content of \\"The Secret\\" needed more specifics on how to apply the law of attraction for different and common problems and circumstances.  The \\"how to\\" is not always immediately apparent or clear, and it can take several attempts before the reader \\"gets it\\".    My personal experience is that for some things, applying the law of attraction seems obvious and easy to do.  However, applying the law of attraction to weight loss was particularly difficult for me.  Just when I thought I was applying the principle in a beneficial way, I found that I was doing exactly the opposite.  It took several attempts before I finally figured out what I was doing wrong.    Even so, I highly recommend \\"The Secret\\" to anyone seeking to improve their life.  Be advised that the content of the DVD is not identical to the content of the CD.  If you tend to be a visually-oriented learner then the DVD is a good choice over the CD.  However, I thought the CD provided more information in general and more \\"how to\\" information than the DVD.

I truly believe that if this album came out after Mellon Collie, It would have been heralded as a masterpiece.     The only complaint I really have is I'm not too crazy about the production. I think they should have gone back with Flood and Alan Moulder. (The producers of MCIS) Zeitgeist is better live ( Watch Starz performed live on You Tube, whoa!)     Other then that, I think the album is outstanding.     I think it would be helpful to know how some of the other reviewers ranked the entire catalog of Smashing Pumpkins/Billy Corgan/Zwan albums. Also it may be helpful to know what they're currently listening to.     As of late I'm listening to Interpol, The Smiths, some Beatles, The White Stripes, and Van Halen (Diamond Dave Era)     Call me crazy; here's mine     1. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness  2. Zeitgeist  3. Gish  4. Siamese Dream  5. (Zwan) Mary Star of the Sea  6. Machina  7. Pieces Iscariot   8. (Billy Corgan) The Future Embrace  9. Adore

0743496728|5.0|I agree with those who wrote that this is the best novel by Jodi Picoult. I have loved every one of her books and this one is not disappointing. In fact, it's riveting in every way. I also felt sadness towards the shooter even though I couldn't forgive him for the killings. And even though she writes about fictional characters, it is way too close to reality and what has happened at our schools.    I also felt a tremendous amount of guilt over incidents that happened in my high school in the 60s. There were students who were also picked on and treated just as badly as Peter was in this story. At the time, we thought it was fun---not thinking about how it made anyone feel. Fortunately, it was years before the era of shooting up students in a school even though guns were much more available in our state. We can give a sigh of relief that one student in particular didn't retaliate in that fashion. However, the guilt feelings I experienced during reading this book will live with me forever. And we can't unring that bell.  During the reading of this book, I learned that our classmate--the one we tortured verbally the most--died a year ago. So I can never say \\"I'm sorry\\" to him. I hope he had a good life and forgave those of us who couldn't tolerate his differences and treated him like he was an outcast. As adults, we now know that nobody should be treated like that. And as adults in our 50s, we don't do that nor do we tolerate it. And yet it continues to happen. The big difference is that now these \\"victims\\" are fighting back and killing those who tortured them. So sad and so tragic.    I also lost a child to cancer and know the pain of losing a child---no matter in what manner they die. I could feel the pain and agony of the parents----of those who were killed in addition to those who were injured as well as the parents of the shooter. They also lost their son and all the dreams they had for him.    This book was so overwhelmingly thought provoking, intense, exciting, sad, happy, real, emotional, tragic----and the characters were enormous, never to be forgotten. Picoult really got into the minds of those who suffered. I'll never forget this story and will read it again. I learned so much----it made me \\"feel\\" and understand so much more. It should be required reading in high school-------it could help.
0312323867|4.0|This book was a quick read.  I actually read it in 1 day of flying from the west coast to the east coast.  In this little series, you can read either book first.  This book was great in that it kept with the same story line as Something Borrowed.  It was amazing to see how Darcy perceives things, and in the end realizes her mistakes.  Great read!!!
B00009W0WM|5.0|I feel sorry for Julia Vasquez who does not understand the subtleties that make the move. The small facial expressions of Bogie, the music and camera angles, the tears in Ingrid's eyes... all these express the love that you do not see.<br />\\"Talk, talk, talk\\" is another complaint! Well, there you miss it again. The movie won an Oscar for best screenplay, it's all that talking you don't understand... you see, today's movies are all action or little dialog that means something. In Casablanca, its a lot of vocalization, not just what is said but HOW it is said...<br />I suggest a film appreciation class because everone else sees it as 4 or 5 stars.<br />Peace, LJ
B000JU7NCE|5.0|What many newer fans of The Cure may not realize is that they started out as an all guitar band.  Robert Smith wanted to be the next Hendrix, but once Matthieu Hartley came on board with keyboards it seemed like the thing to add at the time (Lol Tolhurst giving up the drums later on to take on this post, as well as eventually Perry Bamonte and Roger O'Donnell ).  This video proves that they never need them and that Robert Smith and Porl Thompson are two very under-rated guitarists.  It is amazing what they are adding without the aid of the keyboard.  It gives a slight jagged edge to sounds that one became use to hearing, and they are defiantly better for it.  I hope this continues and should be a must have for any Cure fan at any age.
0061142026|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing novel. It isn't often that you come across a novel such as this one. The descriptions are magnificient and you are just swept away in the story until the last page is turned and you must leave the characters behind. The story has many thread ravels that are unleashed throughout the tale which keeps you guessing up to the last chapter. I can't say enough about this except that it isn't everyday you find a novel as wonderful as this one. It is about a hero, Tristran, who leaves his home in the town of wall and sets off to find the Star(who turns out to be a girl). There are many others who are also after the Star, which Tristran must keep her safe from. If you love romanace, fantasy/fairy tales, magic, and good vs evil, you will love this novel! If your looking for another book to read with this one try [[ASIN:0595293956 The North Kingdom]].

0393061310|1.0|I feel the book is accurate. His knowledge is deep. How this book became a best seller is the real mystery. It must be the catchy title. I'll bet most just went unread and made an inch and a half of paper with a nice cover for coffee tables. I use it for insomnia. My record is 5 pages before I'm bored to sleep.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Dream Theater is known for their complex, progressive arrangements and strong musicianship.  Any band would be happy to have one of these muscians be their hub, but Dream Theater has 5 talents who all excel at their individual instruments.  Bringing it all together in one band is truly a feast for the ears.  This release may be their best yet.  It's a little heavier and a little darker than some of their other releases, and some of their fast, tight riffs have had me pushing the rewind button in disbelief so I could listen again.  The DVD covers the recording of each song, some of the thoughts behind those songs, and a little look into their personalities.  If this is the only Dream Theater release you buy, I guarantee you'll be going back for more.  Highly recommended.

0143038419|1.0|It's hard to believe that this book is number one on the NY Times best seller list! But, then again, in a land of ghost-written bios and diet books, I guess it shouldn't be surprising. Skimming the surface, sound-bites, New Age narcissism, they're all here folks and Ms. Gilbert is a master juggler. It's amazing to me how folks like this can skate along on the surface of life, collecting book advances, multiple homes, spiritual \\"experiences\\", book contracts and new relationships and, at the end of it, still be as clueless as the Pillsbury Dough Boy. I am so grateful that I read this at the library, rather than buy it and be responsible for funding Ms.Gilbert's next excursion. She and Sara Davidson should take a trip through Third World countries together...now THAT would be an interesting read! Hey,who stole my blow dryer! oy gevalt.
B00005221M|5.0|had to watch this in my History of Imperial Britain class, and enjoyed it so much I stopped at Best Buy after class to buy it.    For a movie to be really, truly enjoyable for me, it has to have an amazing love story. And this one blows many other movie romances out of the water. Nathaniel's declaration to cora abou finding her no matter how long it takes just sends chills down my spine. The romance is beautifully acted and perfectly written. It's not over the top or unrealistic., its absolutely perfect.    Even without the romance, I would still enjoy this movie. The acting s superb by everyone. Even the characters you want to dislike (for me thats Magua and Col. Munro), you still understand their motivations for doing what they're are doing.     The scenery is breathtaking. As a North Carolina native, I feel a hint of pride at seeing ow beautiful parts of the state are.    Its a wonderful movie, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower's guitar wizardry sounds to me like 40% Jimi, 40% Stevie Ray, and 20% Les Paul.  His lightning-quick finger speed, coupled with melodic and harmonic precision, great musicianship and communication within the group, and dynamite mixing and track management make Trower one of my favorite rock musicians and this particular album one of the best of all time.  This band is TIGHT.  Interesting to note that it is one of the few named after the lead guitarist rather than the lead vocalist, bassist James Dewar.
B000050XEI|5.0|A Day Without Rain truly highlight's Enya's voice as an instrument. \\"Rain\\" delivers a focus on the sound of the music and not just on the lyrics.
B00000637V|5.0|I heard that Lou dismissed this album for a while. Such is the license of genius. He's since come around, I suppose, having been playing the entire album live around the world. (I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the Brooklyn show last year; such an amazing experience to hear the performance live and so true to the original. Except, unfortunately, for Lou's lackluster vocal performance.) The album itself sucks you in from the opening. A chaotic chorus leading to a beautifully simple piano song. You can listen to Berlin today and still hear things that haven't been repeated in music, beautiful, imaginative things. And one wonders why?<br /><br />The backdrop of characters are a stand-in for something monolithic and dark in Lou's perception of the world, one thinks. Berlin is surely a stand in for Lou's own psychic world.<br /><br />When I worked on my own album last year ([[ASIN:B000SKM3CU nylon]]) the producer and I used Berlin as a creative touchstone. Still as influential, listenable and important today as it ever was.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|I am vaguely familiar with the musical stylings of Sia. I have heard some of her collaborations with the downtempo duo Zero 7. She was the only good thing that I liked about Zero 7 whose music I find rather dreary and uninspiring. I recently came across Sia's 2006 re-release of her album COLOUR THE SMALL ONE. I thought I would check it out. I have to say that I definitely like her solo work than any fo the stuff she has done with Zero 7. Her music is a pleasant mix of pop, folk, and trip hop music, perfect music to listen to while enjoying a cup of coffee while reading the morning paper. The only flaw with her music is that it sounds pretty much the same like her stuff with Zero 7. Still I find her solo music more pleasant to listen to. I really like the delicate melodies and her fragile vocals on songs like \\"Re-write\\" and \\"Breathe Me\\". The one song I really wasn't too fond of is \\"Sweet Potato\\" because of the melody (or lack thereof) and Sia's voice which sounds out of tune. The remixes were alright but I could have lived without them all the same. For all its minor flaws, COLOUR THE SMALL ONE is a very good chillout cd, much better than any Zero 7 cd IMO.
0316018953|4.0|No longer in the Cold Cases Unit, Harry Bosch hits the ground running and never stops in his first case as a member of the elite Homicide-Special Division. His case, the murder of a doctor, possibly by Islamic terrorists, coupled with stolen radioactive materials, brings in the FBI. They enter the investigation holding the mantle of national security and their usual hubris, and the always pugnacious and resourceful Bosch is soon in a battle of wits to remain a key player in the investigation. Adding spice to the story is the return of agent Rachel Walling as a key member of FBI team. Bosch and Wallings have had romantic encounters in the past and Harry is not yet over her. What Wallings thinks of Harry and whether the two will get back together adds a spicy element that fans of the Harry Bosch series will enjoy and gain reasons for hope that something good is on the way for him (sometimes I have to remind myself that Harry Bosch is a fictional character). The FBI is concerned only with finding the stolen goods while Harry believes that finding the murderers is the key to a solution for all. The FBI, of course, does not see it that way and tries to push him to a fringe role. Harry, as one would expect, objects and does his best to solve the murder and not be marginalized.<br /><br />The murder circumstances are horrifying and vile and Bosch has an interesting case to solve and the reader to follow. However, the battle between the law enforcement agencies is what drives The Overlook. It is a very entertaining, but does not have as many twists and turns as the usual Michael Connelly book. I have read all of Connelly's books and compared to his usual novels, it seems to be somewhat on the light side. This probably reflects the fact that it originally ran as a serial which Connelly beefed up for publication as a book. I believe that another reason for the \\"Connelly Lite\\" factor is that the Overlook is written in the third person. Connelly's writing is at a higher level when Harry Bosch is the narrator. Nevertheless, The Overlook is a very competent work that Connelly has no reason to be ashamed of and most people will enjoy. It is only in comparison to the high standard that Connelly has set, and the high expectations of his readers, that this book pales.ry Bosch is the narrator.

B00005YU1O|1.0|Robert Solomon has a very small part in this film and it wasn't enough to save the movie.  Check out any of his books or teachings in The Teaching Company (TTC) series.  He is one of the greatest teachers of existentialism.  But this movie is based around one question... What is reality?  Instead of leaving me with questions of What is it to exist?  I was left with the questions, \\"why did I watch this movie\\" \\"did I expect it to get better?\\"  \\"how did it get worse\\", and \\"how did anyone get anything deeper out of this movie than \\"Space Balls?\\"<br /><br />This movie seems to me like a high school philosophy project based off of the movie \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" or the americanized version (just as good) \\"Vanilla Sky.\\" (except I don't remember if you get to see Penelope Cruz naked in Vanilla Sky;)<br /><br />Honestly... if you want to watch a movie about philosophy or that will at least leave you with existential or profound questions/answers, please check out the following:  What the Bleep, Big Fish, Adaptation, Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which is drenched with Sartre) Dark City, or as I just suggested, Open Your Eyes.  As far as other philosophies... Moralism/Responsibility, check out: The Cider House Rules or Babel. For Futurism/Postmodernity: Brazil, 12 Monkeys or Children of Men.<br />There are a lot of great movies out there... don't waste your time on this one.  It sucks beyond all understanding... it's one philosophical accomplishment.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Simply put, this is the best, most fascinating nature program I have ever watched. Period. Not only is it shot in high definition for you to see all the nuances of nature's beauty, but that attention to detail and subtlety translates into all aspects of the series. The producers go places you have never seen on any other program, witness things that have never been caught on camera, and leap the boundaries of what documentary makers have done in the past. The Planet Earth series cannot be considered anything less than a groundbreaking, important milestone for the (re)connection of people with their planet. This is a must see, must know, must-pass-on work for human kind. If you aren't affected by it, you probably aren't alive.
1587990717|1.0|This book is just a lot of hot air.You read page after page in anticipation of some great insights only to discover more and more waffle.There is not an iota of substance to it. It was a particularly frustrating read for me as I am a bond trader and I constantly got the impression that the author is trying to portray himself as a big deal to the \\"lay man\\".I am mystified at the endorsement by Fortune magazine ...the book is nonsense.
B000HEWEE4|2.0|A clunker. I enjoy romantic movies like \\"Somewhere in Time,\\" but this didn't do it for me. Sandra Bullock and the beautiful scenery kept me going. VERY predictible. I kept waiting for the plot twist. There wasn't any nor much of anything else.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I recently obtained a Fathers Day gift from my son,The Beatles Anthology 5 DVD set. What a SUPER find. I have viewed the DVD set 3 times since purchase...an excellent product. I am very pleased with the purchase and effecient transaction.
B0009J8GWQ|5.0|Although Darkness On The Edge Of Town is a dark album, it is not uniformly gloomy since its despairing moments are often spectacularly swept away by powerful blasts of defiance bursting forth in songs like The Promised Land or Badlands (\\"We'll keep pushin' till it's understood/and these badlands start treating us good\\").<br /><br />There is an awesome grandeur in the tone and the sound, driven as it is by majestic guitars, thunderous drums, sweeping sax and wailing harmonica. The myth of the highway and the freedom it offers, following on from Born To Run, is most dramatically explored in songs like Racing In The Streets and Streets Of Fire.<br /><br />The redemptive power of love surfaces on the beautiful Prove It All Night, whilst the title track is melancholy and erotic at the same time, a brooding ballad of evocative imagery. This is classic Springsteen, a very cohesive album that brilliantly displays his mastery of both the fast-paced rock song and the introspective ballad. Powerful music.
1400063515|4.0|The title phrase of this book has gotten enough airtime that prospective readers may think they already know what is in the book and may not take the opportunity to read it.  I think that would be a mistake.  Events that are hard to anticipate, exhibit extreme variation, and have a high impact are a part of the subject matter, but the book has much more to offer than a discussion of these type events.      Taleb delves into the biases that make it difficult for each of us to assess the probability of events in social interactions.  Of course, his classification of biases can't be canonical -- but he has clearly thought deeply about such biases and organized them into some nice categories that are useful for anybody desirous of examining their own thinking in a wide variety of contexts.    He begins by talking about two very different variables:  those \\"boring\\" types of variables belonging to a class that are modeled by the standard statistical methods -- those belonging to 'Mediocristan.' He contrasts such boring variables to those variable involved in social interactions -- variables exhibiting such a wide range, that only one observation can make meaningless the standard parameters used in statistical analysis.  These variables belong to 'Extremistan.'  Toward the end of the book -- [the weakest past] -- he admits a classification in-between within a discussion of power-laws and fractals.    The main strength of the book is not the above classification, but the authors emphasis on particular fallacies in thinking that cause us to think we know more than we really do.  The book would be pretty good, if just for the clear identification of the common mistakes we make -- when dealing with the information in the 'Extremistan' category -- but Taleb goes further gives us some good ideas for countering some of our natural tendencies and tendencies we've acquired through bad learning. That said, he remains very much the realist about us being able to discipline our thinking to be completely free of such biases.    Regarding the writing of the book -- the writing style is more than a little bit idiosyncratic.  Taleb discusses more than once how much he hates to be edited.  It shows.  However, he is quite good at selecting  the examples he picks to demonstrate the difficulties we have.  His personal anecdotes and even fictionalized accounts which demonstrate these fallacies -- add clarity and overcome his less than disciplined style of writing.    The book isn't specifically about forecasting, trading, history, or a host of other subjects -- but he draws on these examples to get us to think about what we know and what we don't. [Anybody involved in the above areas  as a part of their career would certainly gain from his perspective.]  His larger solution -- negative empiricism -- i.e. being sure to understand what it is we don't know, may not be satisfactory to some. However, I think the perspective that Taleb offers is at once both liberating and humbling to anyone who has been involved in planning.
B000GG4ZU4|4.0|This is probably Reed's most atypical solo album and at first sounds lightweight and subdued, laking the great moments, drama and exciting highlights of his best work. Hard to appreciate immediately, repeated listens reveal Coney Island Baby's lyrical depth and melodic beauty. My favorites include the love song She's My Best Friend, the streetwise Charley's Girl and the sensitive narrative of the title track. Not his greatest album, but valuable as a showcase of Reed's human side in its warmth and simplicity.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Apparently Go Fish Studios isn't so good when it comes to subtitles. They decided to cram the hearing-impaired Japanese-English subtitles and the standard Japanese-English subtitles together. The movie was pretty good, but I kept getting distracted by the fact that it was putting up subtitles telling there was a chopper flying by, birds cawing, etc. I questioned their funding for this project. The film itself, though, was good, in my opinion.
B000000W5N|5.0|This landmark 1971 album gave the Stones a massive hit with Brown Sugar. Together with Bitch and the extended jam Can't You Hear Me Knocking it is one of three powerful rock songs while the rest of the album contain soulful, bluesy or country-tinged ballads.<br /><br />These ballads are all rather dark and brooding, from the melancholy Wild Horses to the unoriginally titled but moving I Got the Blues and the chilling Sister Morphine, whilst Dead Flowers with its country flavor has poetic lyrics and an addictive tune.<br /><br />The album concludes with the yearning Moonlight Mile, a final unforgettable track. This mix of melodious ballads and power rock make Sticky Fingers a masterpiece and one of that decade's top albums by the greatest rock band of all time.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Sky Blue Sky is practically flawless, by far the most complete Wilco album.  The songwriting, guitars, piano, drums, etc. blend seamlessly.  From start to finish an instant classic!
B000BW7QWW|3.0|of the unfairly discarded Fox series, but still a must for fans because the movie fills in much of the backstory for several characters. I've seen all the television episodes, including a couple never broadcast, and the theatrical production falls in the middle in terms of pure entertainment. Its biggest flaw is that it is too dark and sad, depicting the deaths of a couple of great characters. Still, if you have seen this film, you need to see the original episodes. If you have seen them, you also need to see this. The actors are endearing, and I search for them in the movies and TV series of the current season, usually without success.
B00005UW7V|4.0|For excellent analyses and synopses of this film, please see the so many other wonderful reviews of this film written by Amazon reviewers. I echo the many reviews that commend this film for its intriguing plot, marvelous acting, and awesome special effects, but most of all, for its incredible HEART. Yes, no question that the film has many dark aspects to it, and it's probably a good thing that I saw this film for the first time on TV tonight, rather than at the theatre, because I was moved to tears throughout much of the film. I'm going to buy the DVD through Amazon.<br /><br />In the end, the extraordinary insight that I took away from this film was that the experience of loving and of being loved, EVEN IF FOR JUST FOR ONE DAY--whether it be love between yourself and a beloved parent, child, or relative; a beloved pet; a beloved life partner; or a beloved friend--THAT ONE DAY MAKES YOUR LIFE WORTH LIVING. Most of us are so blessed and lucky with more than that one special day with our beloved ones, but this beautiful film perhaps will make you hark back to a certain illuminated or heightened day you experienced that kind of love in your own life and make you realize all you have to be so thankful for in this life.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is, hands down, one of the best albums ever produced IMHO. Every song has its story and even though they are all different they are all powerful. I fail to see, hear, or feel any weakness in this album; it is a complete work of art. The only other albums that come close to this one are Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and The Beatle's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; the comparison of this album to these two speaks for itself. A real gem.

0316067598|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" isn't just a memoir of one of America's most elite fighting men, but it is a testament to Mike, Matt, and Danny's sacrifices for one another. This story will grab your heart and crush it by the accounts of hell that these young courageous men went through, it will anger you of the rules of engagement that are imposed on our servicemen and servicewomen by the \\"geniuses\\" up on Capitol Hill and how the media portrays their actions, it will finally allow most of us, the civilians, to understand the brutalities of a war that is raging RIGHT NOW that many of us are disconnected from.     I was frankly amazed at how Marcus Luttrell (w/ Patrick Robinson) was able communicate directly with the reader. It is almost as if you are at a bar with him, and he is telling his war story (honest). The way these men fought for each other, how they showed no fear in the face of the enemy, with the SEALs famous \\"never say die\\" attitude, these men are the types of people that we can only dream of being just HALF of what they are.    His accounts of the famous Navy SEALs BUD/s training are an everlasting proof at how tough these men really are. His account of the horrendous battle on top of that God forsaken mountain is one of the best depictions of a firefight that I have ever read. And his touch on the home front about his community back home in Texas basically makes you feel that you wish you were a Texan (this coming from a Californian).      \\"Lone Survivor\\" will become a classic for this generation's \\"War on Terror\\" and Marcus, Danny, Matt, Mike, and all of SEAL Team 10's story will forever be burned into my memory. Men like these deserve to live on forever.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|\\"29 years\\" ago (Slow Show)... actually, 3 years ago I came upon this majestic piece of music craftmanship titled \\"Wasp Nest\\" while surfing the Net.  Wow!  Ithought to myself what a great song that was, champagne glasses and all.  Come this year, I stumbled upon this beatiful CD titled Boxer by the same band who wrote \\"Wasp Nest\\".  Honestly, it is just absolutely perfect.  I rarely buy CDs lately, but The National has done such a magnificent piece of art which made me reconcile with all the lost feelings I had about the music industry these days.... hands down, this is the CD to buy this year thus far.  My prediction is that it will occupy the number #1 spot in many critics' lists at the end of the year (alongside LCD and Feist.)  Well done guys!  Keep up the good work!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|NO this album is still not as good as Prisoner of Azkaban--not nearly. That was the best album of the Harry Potter series. BUT, that being said, this album has some wonderful tracks that I really did enjoy. TRACK EIGHT is magnificent, and it is worth purchasing the CD just for this (lengthy) track. Frankly, I felt the CD could have used more tracks like this--it is very strong thematically and has a \\"magical\\" quality that defines Harry Potter. Track two, Umbridge's theme, is very good albeit slightly over repetitive. Track one is wonderful although I agree with reviewers who say that the electric guitar was uncalled for. The nice thing about this CD is that it is \\"Stravinskian\\" from the standpoint that the music is not all thematic but loose and flowing. Some of the tracks (such as track five) are not particularly memorable, but they are pleasant to listen to. Quite frankly, it is track 8 that makes this CD a sell--I love \\"musicbox\\" type of music (my favorite instruments include flute, harp, bells, etc.). So overall, I would say this is a VERY original album and that is what I like about it--a CD doesn't need to have twenty themes to be good. And, moreover, I can listen to it more than once and have enjoyed it each time. I actually have only one complaint--I wish that it was longer (around 60-70 minutes like Jurassic Park or Azkaban).
B000E1YVZU|5.0|That's what I used to think about the Broadway show..I never gave it a chance until I caught the movie the other day on STARZ. I TiVo'd it and watched the first scene before I had to get my 3 year old to bed (she loved Seasons of Love and is an extremely musically-gifted child, which is why I later sat down to watch it).     After finally watching it (here it is July of 2007 and the DVD has been out for 2 years and the Broadway show has been out so long that I should be ashamed for not seeing it sooner) I had to download the soundtrack on ITUNES and can't get the songs out of my head. The cinematic value is very appealing, the music is wonderful..it should not be missed!
B000063Y8F|5.0|I've had other garlic presses in my cooking career and usually they ended up getting tossed......not this one.  Simply stated \\"it works\\".

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I really have nothing but praise for this series.  I think the best thing about \\"Planet Earth\\" is that it is great for all ages.  My wife and I are in our mid-20s, both of our parents loved the series, and I know kids are more than able to appreciate the material.  I'm very excited about holding onto this series for my children; I know they'll love it.    For those in the U.S., many reviewers have pointed out that the narration is different than that which was broadcasted on TV.  I can't really attest to which is better because I first watched this series on DVD.  However, I feel that Attenborough does a great job of conveying his high level of interest in his subjects and really makes you wonder at what you're seeing.    I'd also like to comment on the environmentalism of the series.  Environmentalism is a hot issue these days, and while I'm not a big environmentalist in the way that most people use that term, I am concerned about the environment generally.  I think this series strikes a good balance by bringing to mind the relevant issues without driving the point home to an offensive extent.      All told this is a great accomplishment.  The thousands of hours in the field clearly paid off; some of the shots the camera crews captures are hard to believe.  Further, the insight into \\"nature's ways\\" makes one marvel at creation.  You can't go wrong...
B00005JPFE|5.0|There are few modern films that capture the true passion of wholesome activities both visually and emotionally. So many films try to entertain their audiences by gratuitous sex, sarcasm, violence and profanity in a race to show the gutter of human existence. Curiously, this film is about the animals of the gutter (rats) and how even the lowest in the class hierarchy can have and pursue grand aspirations.    Although this is an animated film, the richness of physical emotional expression of the characters is far superior to that of most films with live actors these days. Perhaps the separation of acting and speaking necessary for an animated film encourages the animators to express themselves visually while the voices are challenged to rise to the quality of the animation in a healthy, mutually fulfilling competition. It harkens back to the early days of talking cinema when the actors still knew how to express themselves visually from the silent film days. It is possible to watch this film without sound and still enjoy it.    In short, this film is so rich, that I can hardly wait to add it to my collection. It is a film for all ages and I plan on using it in my foreign language classes with dubbing to help them visually connect feelings, and vocabulary directly to the vicissitudes of life without translating. Bravo Pixar and Mr. Bird! Encore!
B00005JPKE|5.0|This is the second movie Clint Eastwood did about the \\"Battle of Iwo Jima\\".  The first was \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" that told the story of the TWO flat raisings atop Suribachi, the famous photograph, and the bond drive the funded the latter stages of the war, but at a great cost to the men pulled into that PR engine.  They became casualties of the war as much as those killed or wounded in the battle itself.<br /><br />Here, we see the battle from the perspective of the Japanese who were sent to defend that island and thereby delay the invasion of the Japanese Homeland.  They know the battle will be cataclysmic, but believe there will be reinforcements, naval support, and that they will be supplied with more planes.  When they learn none of this is true, they also realize they are being asked to fight until death.<br /><br />The conditions on the island are not very good.  The water is bad and is giving most of them dysentery.  The new general, Kuribayashi, rescinds the beach defense and wants them to tunnel out the mountain Suribachi.  He wants to prolong the battle as long as possible.  The hard line traditional officers don't like his approach and don't trust him because he has spent time in America and gotten to know American officers.  His one true supporter on the island is Baron Nishi, who won a gold medal in horse jumping at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932.<br /><br />When the assault does come, the Japanese are stunned by the utter size of the invasion force.  Some fight, some commit suicide (against orders) so they can die with \\"honor\\", but almost all die.  In real life, of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on the island, all but 216 died.  Among the American invasion force of 110,000, 8,226 died and 19,189 were wounded and almost 500 went missing.<br /><br />The movie uses a fictional character named Saigo, a baker conscripted into the war, to link the various elements of the battle together by his movements.  A very nice device.  It is this character who buries the letters of the title that are uncovered by modern day archaeologists digging in the caves and tunnels of Suribachi.<br /><br />Some have criticized the movie for making the \\"Americanized\\" Japanese officers the stars.  I have no opinion about that argument, but I really enjoyed the movie.  The fact that it is almost entirely in Japanese with subtitles didn't bother me in the least.<br /><br />Recommended.that are uncovered by modern day archaeologists digging in the caves and tunnels of Suribachi.

072325804X|5.0|This book is a treasure and every home should have a copy on their shelf.  You will have children and grandchildren to read the stories to.  And, for heaven's sake, you can read and enjoy them as an adult.  These are children's stories, to be sure, but they are very charming, the language is pleasant and better than most of what is fobbed off as \\"children's literature\\" today.  And the paintings and drawings are glorious.<br /><br />These stories have been in print for a century because they are so special.  The animals are fantasies, yes, but Beatrix Potter was also a keen observer of animals and nature.  I love how, in Nutkin, she has the squirrels bring the owl different gifts of animals to eat in exchange for gathering nuts on his island.  However, she has the squirrels building rafts and traveling over the water to the island!  My granddaughter loved this story and laughed very hard at how silly Nutkin is.<br /><br />This treasury also has a short note at the beginning of each story about its origins and the Miss Potter's life at the time it was created.  Nutkin, for example, is based on the musings of an old lady who lived on the island and thought they squirrels came from all around when the nuts were ripe.  She enjoyed thinking they came on little rafts.  We also learn that \\"The Tailor of Gloucester\\" was her personal favorite among her stories, and it is easy to understand why.<br /><br />The stories range from those with few words to some with many words and fewer drawings.  None of them are tremendously long.  Readers of all abilities can find something to tackle.  In fact, those who can't read yet should be given the opportunity to \\"read\\" you the story they see in the pictures.  What fun that is!<br /><br />Another wonderful thing is how the characters make reappearances, but remain affected by what happened to them in a previous story.  Peter Rabbit is never as rash as he was after his bare escape from Farmer McGregor in the first story.<br /><br />Simply, I cannot praise the quality of this book enough and urge you to get a copy for yourself and your family.  It is produced with quality and care and is protected by a very nice slipcase. These kinds of collections are usually called a treasury, but this one really is a treasure.s book enough and urge you to get a copy for yourself and your family.

B00008CLOA|5.0|The Dark side of the Moon is possibly the most critically acclaimed recording in Pink Floyd's entire oeuvre, and indeed, I would call it a work of pure genius! With the smooth vocals of Roger Waters and the lead guitar work of David Gilmour Dark Side is a profoundly emotional and angst ridden musical experience. Released in 1973 it was an immediate hit with a youthful generation that felt disenfranchised and marginalized by society, and with its mind expanding post-psychedelic soundscape it also appealed to disillusioned older hippies. As an album Dark Side is thematically darker and more brooding than those produced during the Syd Barrett era Floyd, but is unquestionably an album to thoroughly immerse oneself in. The more one listens to it the more one starts to appreciate what a truly revolutionary album it was for its time; and with its multilayered, complicated sound structures and reflective lyrics it begs to be listened to again and again and again... for it never becomes boring or dull. As one of my all time favorite albums I would certainly call Dark Side a \\"classic album\\" of considerable artistic merit. The Dark Side of the Moon was produced in an era when individual bands had more room to improvise, experiment and express their full creativity; for the big music companies did not yet have as much of a commercial stranglehold on the creative process as they seem too these days. Groups of this time were more radical and nonconformist and would not easily toe the line set by big business executives, and that makes me wonder if an album like Dark Side could even be made today. The rebellious spirit of rock has I'm sorry to say been compromised to such an extent in the age of trashy reality television shows like American Idol or commercially slick programs such as MTV, that image has become in many ways more important than the music itself. That's not to say that there aren't some amazingly cool modern bands out there making the music they want to, and if you keep an open mind you will find them. But really there haven't been many rock groups in recent decades that have captured the spirit of an entire generation, though in their time Pink Floyd certainly did. The Dark Side of the Moon could in some ways be seen as the final swansong of the counterculture movement, and as a fitting soundtrack to the closing of that idealistic generations naive social experiment.<br /><br />If you're going to start collecting the albums of Pink Floyd I suggest that you start with The Dark Side of the Moon, followed by Wish You Were Here, Meddle and The Wall. They're all now available in remastered editions and The Dark Side of the Moon has even been transfered into the SACD format, so the clarity is absolutely amazing! Much of the music of this fascinatingly complex era is timeless and remains as creatively inspiring as ever, and The Dark Side of the Moon embodies this outstanding spirit of quality. So turn on, tune in and drop out!eep an open mind you will find them.

I also own the mini series on DVD (probably the best WWII \\"film\\" that I have EVER seen) and have found that the two really work well together.  I would read a chapter and then watch the corresponding episode.  By the end you feel really close to these extraordinary men to sacrificed so much for the betterment of our country and the world.  They are the definition of heroes and because they refuse to call themselves heroes makes them even more so.  They, and all of our soliders, make me extrememly proud to be an American.

B000EULJLU|5.0|This is my first Tool album so I have nothing to compare it to in their catalogue. I grew up listening to groups like Yes, original lineup Genesis, King Crimson, Pink Floyd etc.all of whom have recorded songs that clock in at over ten minutes. I have seen them all in concert I'm 52 yrs old and am so glad to hear a record that makes me stop and really listen to what's going on. These aren't just songs, they are compositions with beginings middles and ends. The two title tracks as well as Rosetta Stoned are particularly wonderful in that they are complete ideas. Sit down and let those songs take you on a little trip. It will change you. I saw them this week at th PNC in Holmdel, NJ and while I felt they were bone crushingly loud, I was blown away by their performance. I can't wait to see them again.
B000QGDIKM|4.0|A friend recently described this CD as \\"loud,\\" and she was right. For some people that is going to mean The Smashing Pumpkins are back: loud full sound layered and layered and layered and busy...    Others will complain that it doesn't sound like the old Pumpkins, because there are some differences. This isn't Siamese Dream or Mellon Chollie and the Infinite Sadness, it's more like MACHINA with touches of Zwan and The Future Embrace--not three of Corgan's more popular works--but it's these touches that make this album interesting and fresh.    The Smashing Pumpkins are indeed back, with enough of the old raw power and sound to satisfy most old fans and enough creative verve to satisfy those of us who don't want the same old thing from old favorites.    The special edition booklet is about as interesting as these booklets get, which isn't very, but Billy Corgan took the photos himself--even the ones of Paris Hilton. No extra content, just 12 songs, but given the quality of those songs, that's more than enough to make this worth buying.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I was in high school at the time and I will never completely understand that week in August of 1997. It boggles my mind how an entire nation, Britain could fall into such hysterical grief for a mentally unstable, bulimic, and adulterous princess named Diana. This woman was no Grace Kelley or Jackie O. Diana was nothing but white trash with a fancy title to her name. And yet millions cried and balled over her coffin. It's still absolutely mystifying to me.     Otherwise, this was a very good film as Helen Mirren is quite simply the best.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I liked the feel of this one from the very start. It is at times openly repeating Rocky I, which lends this movie it's progenitor's integrity, while still throwing in homages to the later movies without being tainted by their cheaper hooks. It's an emotional walk down memory lane with Rocky that quickly culminates in one bone-crushing fight.    Stallone deserves credit for bringing this character to us, and this movie showcases all his talents (he wrote, directed, and starred in it) richly.    No surprises in this one, but if you like the best the Rocky series has to offer, this film offers the chance to experience it again.

Usually in these types of films you get actors, and actresses who can't or have never played the game.

If you have never seen a baseball film before, this is the one you should see.
B000H2AH7W|5.0|What is love?  What is true sacrifice for a greater good?  What is our relationship to things greater than ourselves?  Big questions, and this novel makes you think about them, feel them, in a profound way.  An alien race forces man to unite, and question our place in the universe, and in the end forces us to question the meaning of love for our children, and the meaning of ultimate sacrifice.  Man becomes a Christ figure to higher intelligence.  I wasn't surprised to see C.S. Lewis praise this book, although it is not really religious, or meant to be any sort of Christian allegory. I've read 20 sci-fi books, and love PKD, but this one has true staying power. But it was also easy to read, and engrossing -- and in the end profound.  A great sci-fi book for people who want to sample the genre.
0316067598|5.0|This true story is one that although it is sad, it should be read by everyone in the US.  The decision they had to make should never have even been a question.  Worry about what the Liberal Media and Lawyers would do to them for doing thier jobs caused these brave men to make a terribly wrong decision that resulted in the deaths of all but one.  I hold Liberals of all stripes totally responsible for the deaths of these men because if they had been able to kill about three of the enemy without worry it would have saved the lives of these men. (and to make the liberals feel better, it would have saved the lives of about 50+ of their terrorist friends)

B00005JMAH|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters after only having read the first Harry Potter book, years before. I liked it so much that it got me interested in reading the other books as well.    The Prisoner Azkaban movie was a wonderful companion to the book. The first two movies were not nearly as good as the books. They missed the mark of fantastical wonder, opting instead for childlike wonder akin to Kevin McCallister walking into Duncan's Toy Chest in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, which was also directed by Chris Columbus. In terms of sticking to the book there were some missing elements, as always happens with adaptations. But the main elements were there and they worked very well.     What Cuaron brought to the movie was a darkness and seriousness that really matured the movie series to a proper level. He handles the terror of Azkaban and the Dementors very nicely, not skirting around their inherently horrifying qualities.    The cinematography was excellent, and the set design appropriately accentuated the emotional weight of the story, such as in the scene when the Hogwarts Main Gate is dramatically locking up or when Harry is standing in front of a giant clock pendulum.    In short, the story introduces a lot of gravity and emotion to the characters and the story of Harry Potter, and it was extremely important that the movie portray this. The fact is Harry is growing up and the responsibilities that come with that are difficult and painful. Cuaron takes these on directly, which I found most appealing about the movie.

4883191028|4.0|I am currently using this book in my Japanese class. I like it because it teaches you things that are relevant to everyday life, unlike some other Japanese textbooks that are just geared towards business travel or college life.    It's entirely in Japanese with furigana over the kanji characters. No annoying roma-ji or English translations. You are forced to learn to read Japanese.     There is also the translation and grammatical book to go along with it that has the vocabulary words and grammar explanations, but the chapters are brief. The real work comes from the textbook where you read and do exercises.    I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who doesn't already know how to read katakana or hiragana, but if you have some knowledge of Japanese, this book can help you advance rapidly. It's best used in a classroom setting or for someone brushing up on their Japanese skills.

It had such a big name cast and the special effects looked so cool; it was all exciting. what a surprise i was in for. firstly, the special effects are great. that's why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. your eyes will be dazzled. but it is boring, slow, and long. there is WAY too much talking. i've never ever seen a movie with so much talking in my life. and i don't mean talking as in \\"give me action and stop the talking scenes.\\" i mean even when there's action they slide talking into the action scenes. it got so irritating; it was like shut up already, do these characters have to talk every single thing? additionally even though it is an action movie there isn't really that much action, i think that's what made it fail. jessica alba looks great in it though!
1590171993|3.0|John Williams (1922-1994) states the theme of \\"Stoner\\" by way of Shakespeare's 73rd sonnet (\\"...To love that well which thou must leave ere long\\") and resolves it on page 250 (NY Review of Books Classics reprint) in a paragraph stating that the substance of love is the experience of life. The novel was first published in 1965, when the study of Shakespeare was still an inescapable requirement of English majors.      William Stoner is a mediocre but profoundly dedicated university professor (tenured assistant professor) of English who teaches literature as an experience and not as the object of exegesis, much less as a politically ideological exercise in deconstructed texts, the ultimate import of which is meaninglessness. His love for his mentally disoriented wife is blunted and eradicated by her stridently emotional vagaries. He finds true love with a graduate student, who conveniently leaves the scene when campus politics threatens to bring about his academic demise.      The novel is written in compelling and traditional English (no split infinitives or adverbial uses of \\"due to,\\" etc.), although there are some questionable phrasings: e.g., \\"something fierce glinted behind her eyes,\\" \\"that mysterious source to whence all poets go,\\" and \\"that grew from a small center of his being\\" [How many centers can a being have?]).      With the current spate of complexity, global inclusiveness, and excessive pretentiousness (ostentatious erudition) in, e.g., Pynchon, DeLillo, Franzen, et al., it is refreshing to turn to a novel in which genuine edification is provided by a small, dark story of a true teacher.

B0001WGDX0|3.0|The tameness of this Beethoven cycle from Bernstein and the Vienna Phil. was deliberate, I suspect. The conductor had already made a massive-sounding cycle in New York with the Philharmonic, and he apparently wanted to hear these works slimmed down, fleet, and classically inclined in Vienna. Even understanding the rationale, there are moments when the readings come close to being either tepid or ordinary. The VPO sounds lovely, and DG has improved on the original thin sonics from the LP era. But I can't square these cautious performances with the free-wheeling and inspired Bernstein I love. If you play any single movement side by side with, say, Riccardo Muti's middle-of-the-raod cycle from Philadelphia on a bargain EMI line, it's hard to tell where Muti ends and Bernstein begins. (Joining Muti and Bernstein, another firebrand conductor, Solti, also tended toward tameness when it came to Beethoven.)<br /><br />I see that the reviewers here are sharply divided between champsions and naysayers. I'm not completey disappointed. The smaller,  more graceful symphonies (#1, #2, #4, #8) are the best in the cycle, largely thanks to the orchestra's elegant execution.  Of the heroic symphonies, the Fifth is dull, the Eroica and Seventh are better but by no means inspired, and the Ninth comes the closest to making one sit up and take notice. LB made a specialty of this work, but his three official versions don't really capture the magic. This one comes closest, and I much prefer it to the emotional wallow that LB indulged in with his famous \\"Ode to Freedom\\" performance at the Berlin Wall after it fell in 1989.<br /><br />As for the reviewers here who heap superlatives on this set, I can't come close to agreeing, and I am a Bernstein fan par excellence.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I've got a theroy- is one of my faveroit songs on here you get to hear almost everyone voice in one song the styles switch as different people sing!<br />Rest in Peace- spike sings here apparently hes got a awesome voice theres a pull to this song and its just fun to listen to you hear his passion for Buffy!<br />Dawns Lament-Dawn has a sweet high voice but not a lot of singing parts I really liked this cause it showed her vocal maturity! It also shows her doubt in the love from her friends!<br />What you Feel- Wow very jazzy and upbeat. The dancing demons voice is deep it sounds good you get to hear dawn again!<br />Standing- Giles and Tara sing its very emotional (i don't like Giles voice as much as Taras voice)<br />Under your spell (reprise)- You get to hear Tara's voice she has some range in this song thats nice. She also has a very good lyrics!<br />Where do we go from Here- the end of the battle this song is sung you hear everyone in this song. Its got a melcoly underbeat but its kind of sad and nostalgic as well as got the feeling of not being defeated! Its a good song!
B0000640SA|5.0|What's this?.......An original film idea?! A very cool un-compromising and un-common film? This movie actually gets better after each viewing?! An Amazing drama/thriller/mystery/action/suspenseful movie with a bit of humor! The 2 disc special edition is very good and has a good transfer.
0385340559|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this installment of the Jack Reacher novels.  The story was interesting from start to finish, the characters compelling and the bad guys get it but good in the end.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought that in a few instances the \\"good guys\\" and Jack Reacher especially, were portrayed as not really being on their game.  Yes, I know it's been 10 years since they all left the military but darn it!  Other than advancing the plot I thought those few moments of \\"slippage\\" just didn't ring quite true.<br /><br />But all that aside, I couldn't put this one down.  I think it was even better than the latest John Sandford, which is really saying something as I'm a HUGE fan of those books.<br /><br />Good job Lee!!  Thanks and I'm looking forward to the next one. :-)
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Rocky has taken some abuse over the years in the ring and out! After the first film the critics seem to think the sequels were formula, but I have always liked the sequels as mindless, but inspiring entertainment! This new and hopefully last installment is very good and is probably the best \\"Rocky\\" since the first film, although Rocky 3 is a blast! This film lets the lovable lug go out with style.
0316067598|4.0|The book will not go down in history as great lit.  It will stay on my shelf as a great story of how dedicated our special forces are to the US and each other.  In detail, Marcus leads us through a horrific firefight that I doubt even he can believe.  Some events are so surreal they appear impossible even while they happen.  The book deeply conveys how much these guys meld with each other.  Combat vets will love the book.  If you've just lost a buddy...wait before you read this.
1400034779|4.0|If you're looking for Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, or Patricia Cornwell here, don't bother.  This book is as much -- or more -- an extended excursion into the mind-set of Africa and especially of its female population as it is a set of sleuth puzzles.  It's hard to believe that this book was written by a Scottish male.  It's also a very rich and rewarding socialogical study of life in what the author considers to be one of the most successful post-colonial nations in Africa.  It is episodic -- a series of cases rather than one single extended case -- and there is so much time spent on the background of the protagonist and the lifestyle of Botswana that the avid mystery fan is likely to be quite frustrated.  But it is a story with its own wonderful rewards, a singularity that should be judged on its own merits rather than how it may fit into an established scheme.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Experience tells me there's two kinds of \\"Extended editions\\": the first are the ones in which the director was forced to do something against his will to fit the movie to a certain length (see Terminator 2, Aliens, Blade Runner, etc.), and the second are the ones in which the outakes weren't all that damaged so the studio took a strictly merchandising decision.   BIG EXTENDED EDITION is obviously the latter but don't let that discourage you, this is one of the funniest films of the 80s and there's is no question it was the one film that took Tom Hanks from OK TV star to bona fide movie star.  My favorite scene: the eating of the \\"little corn\\". I loved learning from the extras that it was totally the product of improvising at the last second !  This is an excelent DVD, it's just that my next viewing of it will be by choosing the original cut.
B00003CXAA|5.0|After my yearly view of these films and 6 months after buying the re-release James Bond collection it has become obvious to me that it can't be too long before a new edition of these movies comes out. The picture on all 3 Godfather movies (in this release) is so full of specks and the sound so limited, it's hard to believe Paramount won't do something about them soon. The new Bond release shows the technology is there for something so much better.  About the movies themeselves, every time I watch #I, I always come up saying that has to be the best movie of all time. I don't care all that much about the Miami section of #II but when the last hour of that film comes up and Michael tells Fredo \\"he's not a brother, he's not a friend\\" and then \\"forgives him\\" at the funeral (while giving Neri the not so forgiving look) well, I'm just not so sure which ones is the best.  #III is obviously not in the same league as the other II. It has plenty of sublime moments but:  a) If not Winona Ryder, why did it have to be Sofia ? Why couldn't Coppola face the truth while watching the dailies ?   b) Why cut Tom Hagen, my single favorite character of the first 2 movies ?  c) Who can buy Michael's son going from law student to established opera singer in about 2 weeks ?  Andy Garcia may be best thing in this movie but as good an actor as he is he can't possibly convince you it hurts him to dump his cousin or, for that matter, dump Bridget Fonda for his cousin.  Still, the opera ending is phenomenal and Sofia's death scene incredibly powerful (thanks to Pacino, obviously). Michael Corleone's confession as well as his death scene are two of my favorite moments of the series so I can not consider #III a total waste.  Motion picture history as a whole wouldn't be the same without the Corleones and forgive me for not including any \\"offer that can not be refused\\" in this review.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Whenever I was in junior high in like 94 these guys owned the metal scene. Their music was very original All the poser kids wore the korn hoodies and everything addidas and pretended to be all mad and hard and emotionally distrought, but their parents were rich doctors and stuff like that, but it was a fun time.  Their music was energetic and raw.  Hell, I even used to listen to Daddy in my room with the lights turned off, cause I thought it was evil sounding and scary, but then again I was like 12.  So now I'm 25 and they just don't do it for me anymore.  This album is TERRIBLE!!! I use it as a coaster for my coffee table, it matches my couch.  When issues came around I heard the beginning of the end.  Why did they have to go and experiment with rapid pads and all those other computer generated annoying sounds?  It seemed like the more weight Johnathan Davis gained, the worse their music got.
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is by far the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched it 4 times in one day and cried everytime! It is the best love story I have ever seen. I will be buying the book very soon so that I can picture the way I want the characters to look.   This movie is not only good to watch with your significant other, but you can watch it with your grandmother, mother, or your [...]little sister!!! I highly recomend purchasing this DVD. You will not only get the entertainment of watching it, but you will get a lifetime of entertainment because the story seems to stick with you in your heart! Enjoy
0618680004|3.0|Richard Dawkins<br />The God Delusion<br /><br />My immediate reaction after reading Dawkins' book, which unleashes the full rational atheistic potential against religion, was to downplay it's contents: \\"Yes, it's all very reasonable, but religion is not about reason, so let's leave it alone\\".<br />This proves that Dawkins has a point, because it is exactly the kind of automatic reflex Dawkins attempts to dispel, and it illustrates how deeply my apologetic stance towards religion is engrained. However, my reaction also shows that he failed to make that point entirely convincingly.<br /><br />Before going on, I hasten to add that it is very hard to judge this book neutrally. One can more or less objectively say that it is well-written, based on solid science, and sometimes a bit condescending. But how original, provoking, offending or convincing you find it will depend on your background .<br /><br />For me, my non-religious and scientific background meant that I was easily convinced by most of the arguments, to the point that the I read the second half of most chapters in a yes-I-got-the-point-do-you-have-anything-else kind of way. But I read them, if only not to miss any entertainment, provided in the most liberal amounts by the chapters on the God-proofs and the discussion of morals in the old testament. The chapter on intelligent design is most welcome, given the amounts of popularity this non-starter seems to have amassed.<br /><br />Still, the idea of an ultra-rational scientist unforgivingly pressing his point against religion all the way sits a bit uncomfortably. Partly this is because in my opinion the idea that people derive comfort from their religion still stands. Dawkins' arguments do make such people seem a bit stupid, which in many cases they are not. (I guess this is half unintentional, but it is the flip side of his funny but cynical and scornful style.) This undermines his arguments that religion is mainly an evil force in the world.<br />But partly, I think my discomfort is due to the remnants of the taboo on questioning religion, that Dawkins sharply and courageously attacks. For that he should be praised.

B00005JODM|4.0|Any film that features a  touching love scene shot in a Baltimore backyard with laundry hanging on the line (as Moms used to say) between Christopher Walken ( Wilbur Turnblad) and John Travolta (as an almost scary Edna Turnblad) is OK with me. That that scene may also be one of the most romantic scenes of this or any year is crazy on the one hand and perplexing on the other. With that being said, director Adam Shankman has magically turned the stage musical into something that is more full of life, more effervescent than either the play or the John Waters slight, though terrific film of 1988.<br />Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky who almost makes us forget Rikki Lake from the film) is a Baltimore teenager: chubby of body, colossal of hair and bubbling over with good cheer and ironclad self esteem. The year is 1962 and the signs of change are everywhere Tracy goes foremost of which is the \\"Corny Collins Show,\\" an American Bandstand-type show which features a \\"Negro Day\\" once a week: a situation that Tracy and her friends Penny (Amanda Bynes) and Link (Zac Efron) are desperate to change into an everyday occurrence. Edna, who hasn't left the house since 1951 and therefore very much aware and embarrassed of her size discourages Tracy from auditioning as a dancer for the show but Tracy, to her credit, feels confident enough about her dancing does so anyway and is finally accepted into the Corny Collins fold much to the chagrin of both Velma Von Tussle ( a gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br />\\"Hairspray is also very much a capsule of its time and place: pregnant women smoking and drinking martinis, children in cars without seat belts buckled, boys and girls hair greased and sprayed to within an inch of its life (Tracy is accused of having a \\"hair-don't\\" at one point) and bigots spouting the kind of gunk that bigots do.<br />\\"Hairspray\\" is ultimately a big, calorie laden birthday cake of a film: you know you shouldn't imbibe but you can't help yourself. But along with the sugar rush of this spectacle there lays some lumps based on reality which point out, not only how much has changed since 1962 but more importantly how much has stayed the same..

B00003CXGG|4.0|This film barely gets away with a 4-star rating from me.  While I enjoy it overall, it lacks what a great Jet Li movie offers - and that is great fight scenes.  Don't get me wrong, there are some fantasticly creative fights (especially the cleverly choreographed scene with the fire hose), but every one is nealry ruined with an added element of Matrix-like effetcs using wires that look very bad.  As for the story, I enjoy it too, but find it to not be quite that much like the Romeo & Juliet scene that it is supposed to be.  There ends up being some unexpected twists in the story, which was nice, but accompanied with really no romance. Its not what you might expect.<br /><br />If you are into it, the best thing about the movie is its cool factor.  It combines martial arts action with elements of hip-hop, pitting the black and Asian communities up against each other (the only thing that really connects to Romeo & Juliet).  The soundtrack constantly has a variety of beats throughout the movie, and the fights are flashy (though a bit overdone unfortunately, as mentioned earlier).  Romeo is basically Han (Jet Li) and Juliet is Trish (the late Aaliyah), and although they form a type of Romeo & Juliet bond, there is no romantic exchange during the film.  The two raging sides end up having little to do with one another, as the acts of violence are actually being committed from within - which is where the twists of the plot begin.  There is some humor thrown into the mix, mainly from the Anthony Anderson character.  DMX has a small role, but apparently some magic was felt since it went on to create a DMX/Jet Li movie - Cradle 2 The Grave.<br /><br />As a martial arts or Jet Li fan, prepare for some disspointment in the action.  Although there are some great original felt fights, some of the effects just ruin them.  The creators tried a cool idea with switching to an X-ray like view of a body if a  bone/bones were about to get broken in the fight, but I found it to be unnessecary.  I enjoy the final fight that Jet Li has, and it could have been better if it didn't finish on such a horrible visual note, once again making affects that look really bad.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun movie.  Its fun to see both sides at each other and then to find out whats really going on behind closed doors so to speak.  The action is fun and enjoyable, if you can overcome some lousy effects.  Not Jet Li's best, but its still better than a lot of other martial art movies out there.e final fight that Jet Li has, and it could have been better if it didn't finish on such a horrible visual note, once again making affects that look really bad.

There are some here with beading, some with added ribbons and cords, and some that build on the basic yarn braiding technique that most knitters use.

0786838655|2.0|I'm one of those grown-ups who sometimes likes to read children's books.  I made a trade with my young cousin - that he would read a children's book that I picked out, and I would read The Lightning Thief, which, according to him, is the best book ever written.<br /><br />This is a book that 10 year old boys, particularly ones who don't like reading or are not strong readers, will probably love.  For that, I think it's great.  It's like an action movie.  You'll love it.  If you are a kid and you are interested in this book, just go read it, don't pay any attention to the rest of my review!<br /><br />Ok... kids not reading?  Listen. I like picking up kids books and rereading them, or reading new ones.  Call it a guilty pleasure but I know there are others out there like me.  I grew up with Michael Ende, Roald Dahl, Judy Blume, Lloyd Alexander, Madeleine L'Engle etc...etc..

So Ambrosia, food of the Gods - tastes like the most delicious thing you can imagine - So what does Percy imagine? Uhh, Strawberry.  Probably Strawberry Flavoring No.5.  Oh the imagination!  Don't forget the creative dialogue - a typical snippit of which might read: \\"\\"Duh!\\" Said the guy.\\"<br /><br />You know, in the fantasy books I read as a child I'm pretty sure the characters never got a chance to shower during their adventures, but somehow they were covered in a sort of \\"noble filth\\" - dust from the road, maybe a blood stain from a slim escape or such.  There's none of that in this book.  I can really imagine these bratty kids running around with greasy hair, smelly feet, and orange cheese puff stains on the corners of their mouths.  Repulsive!  It's like one long Saturday morning cartoon commercial break - there is an action sequence in every single chapter. I didn't like, identify with, or sympathize with any of the characters.<br /><br />In the beginning one of the characters mentions that Demeter is unimportant.  So basically, in Percy Jackson's world, the Goddess of the Earth and grain, bringer of seasons - the \\"nourisher of youth\\" - is a sidebar.  Sort of like this book.  It's all sugar and transfat.

0316926345|4.0|\\"Brideshead Revisited\\"  By Evelyn Waugh<br /><br />I saw \\"Brideshead\\" on PBS years ago, and loved the way it captured the period between the wars when England was still England, gentlemen won its battles on the playing fields of Eton, and matched wits at Oxford.  Evelyn Waugh is a treasure; he has the wit of Oscar Wilde and the satiric sense of a Jonathan Swift or an Alexander Pope. Reading \\"Brideshead\\" on a warm summer afternoon on the patio is like going back to a younger and more innocent time, like Charles and Sebastian had.<br /><br />\\"  I HAVE been here before,\\" I said; I had been there before; first with Sebastian more than twenty years ago on a cloudless day in June, when the ditches were white with fool's-parsly and meadowsweet and the air heavy with all the scents of summer; it was a day of peculiar splendour, such as our climate affords once or twice a year, when leaf and flower and bird and sun-lit stone and shadow seem all to proclaim the glory of God; and though I had been there so often, in so many moods, it was to that first visit that my heart returned on this, my latest.\\"<br /><br />Sebastian's family is utterly dysfunctional: an anachronism dating back to the landed gentry. His father, from whom he estranged but on  whom he depends for money, is a bore.  His brother is a poseur.  The only normal member of the family is the young girl.  Sebastian does what any rational young man might do under the circumstances: he drinks to excess.<br /><br />Charles and Sebastian spend the summer vacations together at Brideshead and on the Continent; reading, painting, exploring the countryside enjoying the languorous enchantment of youth.<br /><br />Much has been made of the novel's religious context: I prefer to think of it as spiritual...a journey from agnosticism to belief. It is also the story of a chaste and platonic love between two romantic young men.  It is no more a gay novel than \\"Brokeback\\" was a gay movie: it's about love, in its various and inexplicable permutations... and loss of innocence.<br /> \\"Brideshead\\" is a joy to return to year after year.<br /><br />****innocence.   \\"Brideshead\\" is a joy to return to year after year.       ****
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Even after nearly twenty years, this movie never fails to bring a laugh and a smile.  The memorable one-liners that you find yourself repeating are still funny today.<br /><br />The commentary reel was great, although I noticed once you turned it on, you couldn't turn it off until you ejected the DVD.  This is likely just a programming error, and not exactly end-of-the-world stuff.  Like others, I think it would have been much better had Mr. Chase decided to sign on and provide his take on the movie; nevertheless, the cast that did show up did an admirable job setting up the scenes and giving some juicy \\"you wouldn't believe this but...\\" background stories.<br /><br />The DVD itself looks good on my hi-def widescreen, although this is another film that could benefit from some TLC in the restoration department.<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy holiday hijinks and laugh-a-minute one-liners that the Vacation series brings.

The music is powerful and the vocals are amazing. Floor continually shows that she is the greatest female singer in her genre.  With every new release, she seems to improve.  I always find myself saying, \\" This is her pinnacle,\\" but she continues to improve. If you are new to the band, this is a great album to start with.  You will find that they will quickly become one of your favorite bands.   Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

He discusses American values, the U.S. Constitution, religion, globalization, race and other subjects that should be of interest and importance to voters. Though he does not propose any solutions, you can at least see where his base line understandings are on these subjects. Whether you agree with his politics or not I recommend you read this book. It is also a very fast read.
B000OPOANE|5.0|The boys from Toronto are back into the swing of putting out great music.  I was delighted to hear the samples from this album on the Rush website.  So much so, I did something that I have't done in nearly 20 years - I bought a new Rush album.  I've been a die-hard Rush fan for a long, long time, but I haven't connected with their newer music since they had a \\"creative\\" change after Signals.    I am so glad that they have gone back to their roots on this album.  These guys can still make great music.  Don't get me wrong, everyone has low periods.  Rush just lost itself for a while.  I and many others like me have been waiting for Rush to put out another \\"Fly by Night\\" or \\"Kings\\" quality album.  Rush is back, folks.  Its not the early Rush, but nobody should expect that after over 30 years of rocking.  It is somehow familiar, like a stranger that you feel like you know immediately.    I am very pleased with this album; I been jamming to it on my MP3 at work for days now.  Welcome back, Gents, I missed you!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A fine cast helped garner the critical acclaim that the feel good comedic drama, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" richly deserved.  A dysfunctional family headed by unsuccessful motivational speaker Richard Hoover played by Greg Kinnear and his wife Sheryl played by Toni Collette embark on a 800 mile journey in a VW bus to a childrens beauty contest their daughter Olive played by the irresistable Abigail Breslin is a late entrant.  Olive had been choreographed and nurtured by her vulgar, heroin snorting grandfather played by Oscar winning Alan Arkin.  Also along for the ride were her gay and suicidal Proust professor uncle played nicely by Steve Carrell and brother Dwayne who'd taken a vow of silence played by Paul Dano.<br /><br />The Hoovers encounter a staggering array of obstacles that are capable of derailing the plans for their odyssey.  Family members become confronted with the decimation of their own personal aspirations during the trip.  They nonetheless pull together to assure that young Olive is able to fufill her destiny, the ability to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br /><br />Directors Faris and Dayton brilliantly capture the inane but heartfelt interactions between family members as the acting ensemble portray a discordant group that rally together in a display of solidarity.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Graceland is probably Paul Simon's last largely received work amid a truly prolific, terrific musical career. Although his most recent album \\"Surprise\\" is deservedly garnering much attention, \\"Graceland\\" will remain timeless forever. Its difficult to say difinitively which is Paul Simon's best solo album, afterall there are so many great ones. I am partial to \\"Hearts and Bones\\" and \\"You're the One\\" myself. Its like trying to pick the top five most magnificent crown jewels from the Tower of London! But this one must find it's way to a comfortable spot in anyone's top 5 of Simon.    Opening with \\"The Boy In the Bubble\\", I must confess not one of my favorite tracks, however a good song and universally well liked; it begins with a drumming of accordion unusual for Simon but well used throughout Graceland. This, morphed with a core beat that can't help but remind one of something strangely disco create a sound that, at the time, must have been cutting edge for Paul. Its unusual to me, but it works. Following is the title track, perhapse the best one in Simon's illustrious career, \\"Graceland\\". This is a fine song and if you haven't heard it in it's entirety, you should. These sample tracks are good, but you can only descern so much from them. \\"Graceland\\" deserves for everyone to hear it once, afterall when you mention Paul Simon to someone they will ultimitely  say something like \\"Oh yeah, Graceland right?\\" His last, best song. \\"I Know What I Know\\" is humorous, entertaining Simon's more comical side as we all know he has one. Great fun, and slightly African sounding. \\"Gumboots\\" is perhapse even more fun, one of my favorites here. The lyrics, the reappearing, wheezing accordion in the background. It's just one of those fun songs. In the next track Simon puts on a slightly straighter face for \\"Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes\\". It openes slow and vocal, just Simon and the appearing Zulu singing group Ladysmith Black Mambazo with which he collaborated in this album for theslight African feel. A really cool song, and if you're lucky enough to purchase this album version with extra tracks, the demo with dominant base guitar is better. Many people will say that \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" is a 'weird' song. Maybe so, but you have to agree that it's also good. Like so many of these songs it is once again fun. \\"Under African Skies\\" and \\"Homeless\\" are the two predominately African style songs, both calm and enjoyable. \\"Homeless\\" is particularly good where we get the best view of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. \\"Crazy Love vol. 2\\" is graceful with it's guitar chords, and lyrics are as good as usual. \\"That Was Your Mother\\" skims the surface of cajun zydago influences of Simon and his version is also quite good, the same with \\"All Around the World\\".     And that's it save for the bonus songs, which are all demos and all enjoyable. This album piloted the group of foreign sounding musical themes that ensued, followed by \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\" (South American), and \\"Songs From The Capeman\\" (Puerto Rican). I recommend checking them both out if you like Graceland. With a great artist like Paul Simon, you aren't bound to come across too many rotten apples!    Enjoy.

B000OMD4BG|4.0|In my Alabama high school, our English teacher had us select writers to do a report on. She carefully went down the list announcing a name with a short one-line bio to quickly introduce the writer to the class. My hand shot up to claim Sylvia Plath when I learned she committed suicide in her thirties; I was morbidly intrigued. In preparation for that school report I remember sitting in the library with headphones on listening to a BBC recording Plath made of her poem \\"Lady Lazarus.\\" I can still hear the tone in her voice when she announces: \\"I have done it again. One year in every ten I manage it.... And I a smiling woman. I am only thirty. And like the cat I have nine times to die.... The second time I meant To last it out and not come back at all.... Dying Is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well. I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I've a call.\\" At the time I couldn't help but read into every quiver as evidence that Plath knew she was going to take her own life shortly after writing and recording this poem.<br /><br />I approach Elliott Smith's posthumous release New Moon with the same ears; with song titles like \\"Going Nowhere,\\" \\"Whatever,\\" \\"Almost Over\\" and \\"Big Decision,\\" I thought I would hear something in the lyrics that would announce his early death in 2003 (which was first reported as a suicide, though the evidence is still inconclusive on whether or not the two stab wounds were self-inflicted). Epitaph Records released an album with some of his newer material in 2004, but in New Moon, Kill Rock Stars offers a 24-song double-CD with material he recorded between 1994 and 1997. The CDs offer more examples of his songwriting brilliance, using acoustic guitars and simple recordings that are the basis of his earlier work. I never really got into the overly produced stuff he put out after leaving Kill Rock Stars, so this CD offers a great look backwards at a sound that was so familiar to me in college. There are no big surprises on this album, but fans will enjoy these previously un-released tracks.are no big surprises on this album, but fans will enjoy these previously un-released tracks.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Interesting concepts, moving, heartfelt, wonderfully entertaining and comidic humor.  Another great film wonderfully directed with the young Johnny Depp.  A gamut of emotions are stirred.  A clean, funny and beautifully written piece.
B000FILW86|5.0|Looking back at my life and the music that carried me through the years, the band Cheap Trick percolates to the top. While they are not the only band I have ever had a fondness for, clearly, for me, CT has been the band that has stood the test of time.     As a teenager in the 70s, CT was there with me each step of the way. Success and failure, love and heartbreak, they were the soundtrack to my life. Most recently, on a whim, I saw them in San Diego, with my fiancee, and as a result, I happened upon Rockford.    What a delight. Rockford clearly delivers all I have ever come to expect of the band, and fits in with all the other CT albums I own. Tear jerking ballads, and music with an edge. It's all here, and sounds as fresh as ever.    The Beatles surely were a ground-breaking band. But Cheap Trick, in my opinion, has always delivered so much more, and Rockford only helps to validate, for me, that belief. Way to go guys, and keep it coming.    My favorite track? O Claire. What an amazing song.
B00006I53S|5.0|Using this lens on a Canon Rebel XTI and as a general carry-around lens.  It's definitely better quality than the stock lens (EF-S 18-55mm).  Image Stabilization is AWESOME!  It's a bit heavy for the XTI but it looks great!  Not a great lens for macro shots and wide angle (there are other suitable Canon lenses for those).  With the image stabilization enabled, it takes a bit more time to focus so no quick point and shoot.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Let me start by saying Casino Royale was a really good movie. I enjoyed it, and I thought Daniel Craig was/will be a great James Bond. The problem was, there was very little in this motion picture that indicated it was a James Bond film. The really slick pre-title action sequence was missing. The Maurice Bender style credit sequence was missing. There was no gadgetry. No Q. No Moneypenny. There was very little humor (even Tim Dalton's Bond contained some humor). They could have called Craig's character Ethan Hunt and called this movie Mission:Impossible IV. In spite of the fact that Casino Royale was jam-packed with action, and and had a better plot than a few other Bond flicks, it didn't seem like I had just watched Bond 21. I don't know where Barbara and Michael will go from here. I assume Bond 22 will further the plot of Casino Royale, trying to get the arms merchants, but I can't even begin to think of where they will go there after. Other than being a great action adventure, there is nothing unique about this version of Bond that will sustain it for any period of time. Thus, I consider the end of the James Bond franchise to be Die Another Day. Again, I enjoyed Casino Royale, and Daniel Craig was a surprise in his portrayal of 007, but there was no feeling of having visited an old friend after viewing Casino Royale. As a stand-alone action adventure, I gave this a rating of 8, but in spite of beautiful photography and a great soundtrack (although I didn't care for Chris Cornell's title song) and Craig's great performance.... as a Bond film I can't give it more than a 5 or 6.   But now that I am watching it on my 10' screen in 1080P on the Blu Ray disc, this is easily the best HD transfer of any Blu Ray movie I have seen.  It is crisp, colors are great and it actually looks better than it did on the screen at the cinema last Thanksgiving.  It has become my \\"show-off\\" disc.  When someone wants a quick glimpse of how good a Blu Ray disc can be, I throw Casino Royale into the PS3 and crank it up.  I still miss the humor, gadgets and one liners from the first 20 Biond films, but Casino Royale in Blu Ray is ear and eye candy.
B00005K3OT|3.0|This movie is good for Johnny Depp fans as the rest of the story is lacking.   Very shallow and although it addresses the supression of Christianity, it seemed lacking in story, character and purpose.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Really, I wasn't expecting much from Billy after all these years, so I was mildly surprised by the quality of the songs in Zeitgeist.  Corgan is always a good craftsman, but the passion has been gone for many years.  In Zeitgeist, some of it is back.  A song like Bleeding the Orchid has not appeared in a Smashing Pumpkins album for years, but here it is, and it's great.  I think the long break was good for the band, and they seemed to have gained back some of the passion.  I can't wait to see a show now.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|Me being a big fan of the Silent Hill games, I loved this movie. I thought they pulled off the sound, feel and atmosphere of the games perfectly. The acting was a little cheesy at times, but besides that, the directing and effects were all top notch.<br /><br />Out of the 25 Blu-Rays that I currently own, this is by far the best looking. The sound is also quite good.<br /><br />I gave this movie 5 stars because of the visuals and sounds, but also because of the amazing clarity of Silent Hill on Blu-Ray. I very much recommend it.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I now have over 300 Blu-rays, and this is still one of the best looking and best sounding. The price has greatly lowered. If you are still questioning whether to buy it or not, BUY IT. You won't regret it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I typically do not write a review that is not actually a review, but I read a few \\"reviews\\" that hit me just the wrong way. I would first like to apologize for this not having anything to do with the actual content of the DVD, but for anyone with any amount of sense, this will help you make an informed decision on your purchase. ANYWAY...    Other people have complained that this isn't the \\"American version\\" and is narrated by some British guy. First of all, the American version was made \\"American\\" simply by putting an American's voice over top of a British video. Wow, big change; that hardly constitutes as a different version.    Secondly, the item page contains phrases such as \\"Actors: David Attenborough,\\" and \\"narrated by Sir David Attenborough,\\" and \\"Note: this edition features the original narration by David Attenborough.\\" Such phrases typically would clue a person in as to the fact that it is narrated by David Attenborough. Similarly, I would have a hard time forcing myself to believe that Sigourney Weaver narrated this version after reading those statements. Maybe these people thought it was odd that Sigourney was spelled D-a-v-i-d on the page, or maybe they just didn't take the extra 2 seconds to make sure what they were buying was Americanized to their liking.    Finally, if you knew anything about Sir Attenborough, you would know that he has spent his entire life traveling the world learning about, and teaching us about the world of plants and animals. It almost makes sense for someone with immense knowledge about the subject of a film to narrate it; maybe I'm wrong. The only thing Sigourney Weaver knows about animals is how to eat them, wear coats made out of their hides and read a script in a monotone voice about them.    I would just like to say to anybody considering purchasing this item who is not sure that they want the original version: you will not be disappointed. If you are interested in seeing wonderful footage and learning something, the narrator shouldn't matter to you anyway. BUT, at least you will be listening to somebody who is passionate about the content of which he speaks instead of somebody reading a piece of paper.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Well done film.<br />Kind of combines elements of \\"ABSOLUTE POWER\\" and \\"BOURNE SUPREMACY\\" into a single film.<br /><br />Is good to see a film that draws a clear line between good and evil, unlike the wishy washy \\"everything in the world is grey\\" message Hollywood tends to send these days.<br /><br />What prevents 5 stars ?<br />I suppose it is to be expected with Danny Glover involved in the project, but in an attempt to explain the crookedness of world governments in general, they take a few overly obvious stabs at US President Bush that seem a bit forced and contrived and awkward.<br /><br />Hollywood.... unless you are making true documentaries, keep your politics and propaganda at home !

B000000ZGO|5.0|One of the great masterpieces of 60s and 70s R&B (and still one of the genre's key standard-bearers), Hot Buttered Soul is an impeccably crafted album, a stunning showcase of music at its emotionally resonant best. The record's production is simply stunning, a dreamy and overwhelming combination of lush strings and refined horns with throbbing basses and raw, distorted guitars. Each song is an impossibly well-built soundscape, a work that gushes with emotion and unchecked power. Hayes' rough, warm voice rings with both devotion and sex, pain and sensuality. The man fills every lyric on this album with life and passion, transforms each sentence into a sermon. The result? Pure gold.    The album opens with an epic reworking of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's \\"Walk on By.\\" Hayes' arrangement lends the song an incredible amount of tension, complimenting the dramatic lyrics with swirling horns, relentless rhythms, and cruel electric guitars. It may not be a Spector-esque \\"wall of sound,\\" but it is some kind of musical architecture. The song slowly builds in intensity, finally exploding a thundering climax (or should I say catharsis?) of flailing strings, breathtaking melodies, and the hypnotic, relentless throb of an organ. The result sounds like some unprecedented combination of \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"Down By the River.\\" Brillinant!    Next up is \\"Hyperbolicsyllabicesquedalymistic,\\" which has a lot more going for it than a great title. It's a stomping soul-funk stunner, with a nasty wah-wah guitars and some unstoppable stomping rhythms. Hayes' voice is pure attitude. He's like a laid-back, cooler-than-cool James Brown. The song's extended instrumental break is a sweaty, hypnotic jam, driven by a fantastic piano solo and a thudding bass line.     After that is \\"One Woman.\\" At a \\"pitiful\\" five minutes and seven seconds long, it's the shortest song on the album. It's also the tamest, devoid of the grittier sounds faound elsewhere on Hot Buttered Soul. Still, it's a beautiful tune, thanks to its soaring melody, gorgeous orchestration, and Hayes' impassioned vocal.     Finally, there's \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix.\\" A classic example of an artist covering a song and making it entirely his own, this recording should (if there's any justice in this world) go down in history as one of the greatest soul performances, ever. Isaac takes his time with the song, unselfconciously stretching it across over eighteen minutes. Nearly half of the performance is spent on an incredible opening narration, in which Hayes relates the tune's backstory over a minimal accompaniment (a single, pounding cymbal, with a humming organ), slowly building up a sense of emotional anguish and escelating tension- before releasing all of it in the song's second half, a relentless rush of gushing orchestration and nuanced vocals. Like \\"Walk On By,\\" the song goes out on a sky scraping instrumrental climax, putting the ideal cap on a great song (and a great album).    Great, great stuff. If you even vaguely like soul or R&B, you really should have this.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I was determined not to like this movie! After all, I merely got it on sale as a second used DVD so that I could get two for the price of one. However, \\"The Illusionist\\" turned out to be far better than the well-touted movie that I bought in the first place. Furthermore, after the first few minutes, I found myself becoming totally absorbed in the suspenseful story, which is well acted (Perhaps Edward Norton's openhanded gesture as the brooding illusionist Eisenstein cast a hypnotic spell over me!). I especially liked Paul Giamatti as the Inspector. The costumes are splendid (except for the klutzy jodhpurs that Jessica Biel wears in the otherwise romantic last scene). In the rest of the movie, she is lovely, as are the \\"Viennese\\" settings in Prague (which has become a period-movie substitute for any city that was largely flattened during World War II). I was so engaged by Eisenstein's illusions (aided by Philip Glass's compelling musical score) that I suspended my disbelief (especially my sharply-honed sense of historical disbelief) and was both surprised and delighted by the ending (and they did have a crude pre-electric heat-powered magic lantern show in the 19th century, to answer one reviewer's objection). My only real complaint has to do with the over-saturation of the colors in the cinematography. As the director explains in his commentary (which demonstrates that magic explained is no longer magic), the color was done in such a way to give the film an antique look, but the fact that I was constantly aware of this particular special effect indicates that it may have been overdone. This quibble, however, is a minor one in a film which I enjoyed immensely by simply accepting it at face value.
B0000067L2|5.0|First let me prejudice myself by saying I'm a big fan of music from the sixties and seventies. I'm in my late forties so this is what I grew up listening to. I recall my parents thinking this was loud and obnoxious. Now they can say that it's listenable. I wonder if I will feel that way with some of the terrible music being recorded today.  Of course you have a lot more choices today but, perhaps you shouldn't. I still love this recording!. Sunshine of your Love is one of all time favorite songs. It's stood the test of time. Disraeli Gears is a classic.
B0000062FN|5.0|Santana's third album is pretty fantastic.  Let me take that back- *consistently* fantastic.  I really had no problem with any of the songs.  I didn't think any of them were a few minutes overlong, and I certainly didn't think any of the tracks were filler-ish.  After the album had ended, I felt like I had just gone through the biggest roller coaster ride of my life (and I'm afraid of roller coasters!)    Compared to Abraxas and Caravanserai, the latin percussion beats that made Santana so legendary and famous are *extremely* loud, heavy and nonstop on their third album.  I wasn't expecting to hear an album with so much energy and a nonstop partying atmosphere but that's exactly what the album is.  This is totally a hard rock/jam rock album with the volume turned up a few notches higher than usual.  I wasn't bored at all.  There's also a fairly frequent amount of vocal work, too.  Always played with melody, and a feeling of total outdoor freedom.  I can just picture myself dancing the night away to this wonderful music.      The guitar playing, the heavy amounts of percussion and latin rhythms, the sparkling production... this is one album all rock and roll fans must have in their collection!
B00006LJ6X|5.0|I have said it in other reviews of classic Chicago albums, and it's true for Chicago VII as well: the tunes I avoided in my youth (in the case the cusp between high school and college) are much more interesting to listen to now that I am \\"mature.\\" Whereas I used to love the big, bold and brassy, I can better appreciate the jazzy and the inventive. Both kinds of music are well-represented on this wonderful album.<br /><br />The first side has no hits, but abounds with music that showcases Chicago as a mega-talented ensemble. The album start with \\"Prelude to Aire\\" a Satie/funk fusion piece that features Walt Parazaider's flute and showcases some very expressive melodic bass playing - what Peter Cetera always did best. \\"Aire\\" is a standard Chicago instrumental -- horn-heavy and urban-flavored - featuring some excellent Terry Kath guitar solo work \\"Devil's Sweet\\" is an experimental jazz piece that features everything from a sweet sax-trumpet duet to meditative solo drum work to hard driving space music. The unfortunately-titled \\"Italian from New York\\" is an interesting, unpoppy experimental piece that starts out with a synthesized repeating riff whose beeps and boops - the kind R2D2 would later make famous in \\"Star Wars\\" - are built upon by the rest of the band. The album's solid jazz section ends with \\"Hanky Panky,\\" another hard driving jazz piece that features Jim Pankow - one of the best trombonists in the business - doing phenomenal ad lib solo work.<br /><br />The entire album (all fours sides for those with phonographic memories) abounds with a sense of light and easy optimism and relaxed joy. There's little of the unrelenting heaviness of Chicago VI, with its leaden hits (\\"Feelin' Stronger Every Day\\" has all the charm of King Kong rampaging the downtown) and its downbeat take on life. Even the names are lighter - \\"Aire,\\" \\"Lifesaver,\\" \\"Hanky Panky.\\" Whatever happened between Chicagos VI and VII should be bottled and sold on street corners.<br /><br />The album's hits are sweet and fully formed. \\"I've been Searchin' So Long\\" (what does this band have about droppin' its `g's?) is an almost religious rhapsody about finding meaning in one's life. The form of meaning is unspecified, and there is something uncomfortably cult-like about it. The line, \\"When my days have come to an end I will understand what I left behind - part of me\\" seems to hint at some kind of afterlife, but what kind (philosophical, traditional religious or New Age) is anyone's guess. Regardless, the horn parts are subdued, in keeping with the prayerfully ecstatically tone of the piece. \\"I've Been Searchin'\\" segues into the party-fully ecstatic rhythms of Mongonucleosis, an infectious salsa piece that will have dance and shout \\"Que pe chesa!\\" (whatever that means) along with the band.<br /><br />At this point, the album stalls briefly with a couple of Terry Kathy songs. \\"Song of the Evergreens\\" aspires to be a song about the beauty and serenity of natural the world, but only manages to be a song about skiing. The final lyric, \\"Snow! Snow! Snow!\\" is repeated endlessly and seems more suited to a Perry Como holiday special than ajazz-rock album. \\"Byblos\\" is musically interesting but lyrically weak. Kath starts daringly enough with an acoustic introduction that builds throughout the tune. The tune's narrative is an startlingly unpoetic description of Kath's meeting with a woman in Byblos, evidently a bar. Kath seems simply to have described each step of the encounter (\\"Then, soon she had to go; I sat there all alone and thought of things she said the whole day through. And then I realized I never took the time to find out where she lived...\\") and put them to music. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but vapid lyrics like these probably would have stopped any thoughts of a Kath solo career in their tracks. Definitely listen to these two pieces, but pretend not to understand English.<br /><br />The album soon recovers with two of the bands' big hits. \\"Wishin' You WereHere\\" (there goes the \\"g\\" again!) -- one of Peter Cetera's best efforts -- is a sweet, lyrical and wistful and sung with the Beach Boys. \\"Call on Me\\" by trumpeter Lee Loughnane has a driving beat and wonderfully open and clear horn fanfare. The lyrics tell the hackneyed story of a breakup, but the upbeat tone dispels any sadness the story might have carried.<br /><br />The album ends with a couple of Robert Lamm pieces. \\"Woman Don't Want to Love Me\\" has a driving beat that drives along, accompanied by horns and Terry Kath's waa-waa guitar. \\"Skinny Boy\\" is better than in ought to be, thanks to Jim Pankow's horn arrangement and backup work by the wonderful Pointer Sisters. Lamm reprised this piece (sans horns) on his solo album and it was a disaster. \\"Shows to go ya\\" that the strength of Chicago as an ensemble.<br /><br />The CD extra is a rehearsal for Kath's \\"Byblos\\" -- accompanied by bass drums, congas and organ but lacking the overdubbed guitar solo and backup vocals on the album track. The track is more quickly paced than the album version, but otherwise is a fairly well-realized version of the piece whose shortcoming I discussed earlier.<br /><br />Chicago VII is a completely different animal than its dour-sour predecessor. In my experience, this album is the high point of the later half of Chicago's period with Terry Kath. After this, with the exception of terrific pieces like \\"Mississippi Delta City Blues\\" on Chicago XI, the band slipped into pop-encrusted irrelevance, as far as I was concerned. Chicago VII is the last time the original band was together, producing the jazz/pop fusion that made it famous and moving in interesting new directions.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|If you are a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins then you will not be disappointed. It sounds as though they never left us. Billy's song writing is vintage Pumpkins with heavy guitars and bad-boy singing aggressive lyrics; more in tune with Machina than Siamese Dream. Jimmy Chamberline's drumming shows us why Billy constantly goes back to him to play. I can't understand why there are Pumpkins fans out there bagging this album - there must be some sort of grudge against Billy or something, this is first-rate Smashing Pumpkins. Maybe when the dust has settled, these fans might reflect on their statements. Zeitgeist is no weaker than any previous Pumpkins album.    So Darcy and Iha are missing! If you are worried by the absence of these two - its not that apparent on this album - there are female backing vocals and high-pitched guitars present. I would be more worried if I was to go and see the band live and not have these two on stage.    Anyway, the first half of the album is quite heavy while the second half of Zeitgeist is more mellow - a similar format to Machina. You'd be forgiven if you thought this was the second of a trilogy. Tracks 1 and 2 'Doomsday Clock' and '7 Shades of Black' both employ heavy guitars over 3 high-tempo minutes in a similar vein to 'Everlasting Gaze' or 'Zero'. 'Bleeding the Orchard' is slower and dreamier while 'That's the Way (My Love is)' is the stand-out track on the album; a rocking number with a great melody and lyrics. It reminds me of 'Stand Inside Your Love' as I get the same feelings listening to it, and it is these special moments (see also Galapagos, Mayonaise) that only Billy can provide in his own special way. 'That's the Way (My Love is) is the reason why I listen to Billy Corgan - for moments like this, which mind you, only occur when he's writing a Pumpkins song. The first single, the punk oriented, 'Tarantula' follows and suffers somewhat despite being a great stand-alone song. After 'Starz' we have the key track - the 10 minutetrademark epic 'United States', musically similar to 'Glass and the Lost Children' or even 'x.y.u.', it accuses with its call for political revolution. A series of slower and heavier songs finish the album - more like Machina than Adore. The only exception here is the pacey 'Come On (Let's Go)'.    Overall, the Pumpkins (despite being almost irrelevant these days) have produced a great album. It's not going to revolutionise rock, so enjoy it for what it is - a new effort for which Billy and Jimmy should be applauded.
0920668372|5.0|This has been one of my favorite stories ever since I can remember.  As a child, I loved the book because of the mother's unconditional love and the repetition of her song throughout the book.  I still love this book for the same reasons.  The people who are weirded out by this book need to look at the story through a child's eyes-- for children, there is nothing greater than knowing that their parents will always love them unconditionally.  While some people may enjoy subjecting children's literature (including picture books) to literary analysis, they ought to at least try to analyze the stories through the eyes of the intended audience.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|First off, I would like to state that I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this much-vaunted Pumpkins (semi-) reunion - and Zeitgeist itself - is a genuine labour of love. I believe Billy Corgan is wealthy enough and famous enough to have been fully aware of the scandalous campaign of BS and mudslinging that would inevitably follow in the wake of the band's reformation (I'm looking at you, Pitchfork Media).<br /><br />The main justification I have for this view is that Corgan, when discoursing on the band, has always given the impression that he vehemently believes that the Smashing Pumpkins were/are more than just a band, more than just the musicians and the music - they were a divisive concept, an interminable paradigm of rife contradiction. If, for example, Pearl Jam had disbanded after their 2000 album Binaural, I get the impression that Eddie Vedder would never speak with such reverence and zeal of the NOTION of Pearl Jam, over and above the band's songs and ethos, which is all the more peculiar bearing in mind that the Pumpkins (Corgan) generally distanced themselves from political dissidence.<br /><br />With this in mind, Zeitgeist was always going to be something of a megalith recording. With Corgan's apparently newfound political bent pervading the record, some listeners may be taken off guard. On Zeitgeist - as is somewhat belied by the title - Corgan has traded the zeitgeist of adolescent misanthropy and alienation which informed what many consider to be his songwriting heyday (Siamese Dream, 1993 & Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, 1995) of the mid-90s for one of overt social and political critique that informs the present. He doesn't always get it right, however. His knack for articulating his own individual personal anxieties far outweighs his occasionally ungainly indictment of the current climate of fear and mistrust. Yet by the same token, he is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and passion has always been the core requisite for quality artistic output, and few can deny that his sentiments are misguided.<br /><br />The genius of Billy Corgan though, has always been found in his ability to stop his emotions from completely running the game. His keen analytical eye and instinctive gift for songcraft stop Zeitgeist from digressing (save for briefly on the nigh-10 minute `United States' wherein the band allow themselves to drift slightly too close to Tool's `Third Eye' [Ænima, 1996] ), with the album clocking in at an uncharacteristically lean 52 minutes.<br /><br />Jimmy Chamberlin on drums has rarely performed better than here, and he and Corgan bulldoze their way through the dark, high-octane openers `Doomsday Clock' and `7 Shades of Black' as if intent on making up for lost time. First single `Tarantula' is another masterblast (My Chemical Romance comparisons not withstanding) with Corgan seemingly espousing the ambiguous demands placed on the performer by the spectator and reasserting his own position therein, drowning in a chaotically cathartic sea of lead guitar. `Starz' epitomises the band's signature whisper-to-a-scream style, with Corgan's recent(ish) guest appearances with Alice in Chains striking a chord, with Chamberlin's percussion recalling Alice's `Social Parasite' in particular.<br /><br />The pair haven't lost their exultant side however, with the (figurative) calls-to-arms `Bring the Light' and `(Come On) Let's Go!' complementing Corgan's deeply personal musings in the contemplative listlessness and fragility of  `That's the Way (My Love Is)' and `Neverlost', whereas the poignant `Pomp and Circumstances' offers a hauntingly equivocal close to proceedings.<br /><br />Negative press on the album centres on the homogenous nature of the album, to the detriment of the band's famed versatility and eclecticism. Yet from start to finish Zeitgeist represents the Pumpkins' most cohesive and focussed work, with ballads, rockers and laments all sharing certain common aesthetic traits, most notably a strong industrial edge on what is quite possibly the band's heaviest work to date.<br /><br />Something of a synthesis of all five previous albums (and a whole lot more extraneous work) Zeitgeist may take a few years to work its way to the top of many fans' favourite lists, yet there surely can't be too many fans left wholly dissatisfied (save for the morons who had decided to hate the album before they'd even heard a single note), my only slight disappointment being that there is not quite that one track of quintessential Pumpkins brilliance (`For Martha' [Adore, 1998] or `Stand Inside Your Love' [MACHINA, 2000] ) that defines some of the band's less-favoured (not by me, I hasten to add - MACHINA remains my personal favourite) work. * Ironically, this song can be found on the Blue version of the album with the song `Stellar' - it is a truly gorgeous track.<br /><br />Debuting at #2 in the US and #4 in the UK shows that - contrary to the view of nay-sayers everywhere - Corgan's star hasn't fallen too far.

B000O1799U|4.0|I feel it incumbent to weigh in on the Oscar controversy surrounding \\"Dreamgirls\\".  Not having seen the film at the time the nominations were announced, I was taken aback nonetheless by it's shutout in the Best Picture category because of it's win at the Golden Globes and the pre-nomination forecasts.  Having now seen the film my feeling is it wouldn't have been out of place in the Best Picture category but 2006 was a strong year for pictures.  I can think off the top of my head three films that also could very well have been nominated(\\"Blood Diamond\\", \\"Children of Men\\", \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\").  As far as Alan Arkin's upset of Eddie Murphy in the Supporting Actor category, well, the Academy got it right in my humble opinion.  For sure Murphy's account of James \\"Thunder\\" Early was an impressive piece of acting it brought to my mind Murphy's send-up of James Brown on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" 25 years ago.  I was more impressed with Murphy's work in \\"The Nutty Professor\\" in 1996 which he won a New York Film Critics Circle award for.  As for Jennifer Hudson, there should have been an inquest if she were denied the Best Supporting Actress award.  It's been years since an actress has come on the scene and dominated a picture like Hudson does here.  When she's not on screen, the energy level of the picture goes down slightly.  Her showstopper, \\"I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\" should be listed as one of the classic moments of American film.  I remember when Hudson was on \\"American Idol\\" and she was criminally voted off early in the competition.  I think alot of it had to do with the unseemly harsh criticism directed at her by Simon Cowell.  Hudson maintained her dignity but was no shrinking violet in the face of these barbs.  My gut tells me that Hudson chanelled that experience into her performance here.  Jennifer got her revenge on Simon.  As for the film itself it's a better-than-average fictionalized account of the Supremes story.  Hudson's song aside, the music is good but notindelible.  What distinguishes the film is the superb ensemble acting.  Oddly enough, the underrated Danny Glover got scant mention in the film's reviews.  My guess is that he is so consistent that he tends to be overlooked.  If the film has a weakness I would have to say it's the film's ostensible star, Beyonce Knowles.  Knowles is extremely attractive and a very good singer but she leaves a little to be desired in the acting category.  The makers of the film, cognizant of this, cleverly tailored the film around Knowles' acting deficiencies.
B000T46O8O|2.0|The premise of the film was silly and that's what caught my eye. Well that and all the other reviews that said how wonderful it was.     For me the film drug out and I kept hoping it was going to get better. The only reason I kept watching it is because I was curious on how it was going to end.  Having seen the end I wish I hadn't.  It was the end that irritated me the most, completely moronic. But I can't tell you about it or I would be ruining it for you.  Hmm,,,  maybe I should tell you.  I'd be doing you a favor.
6304698526|5.0|I saw this film when it was released nearly forty years go. It holds up well after all that time. The cinematography is not to be believed, the plot has enough twists to keep you both guessing and intertained, Steve McQueen as the taciturn detective Frank Bullitt (he does a lot of acting with his baby blues) reminds us of what a fine actor we lost when he left this world far too soon, and the stunts are as good as they get.<br /><br />Everybody talks about the famous car chase on the streets of San Francisco. On the other hand, there is another great chase that takes place on foot at the San Francisco airport. Don't forget how Detective Bullitt gets a free newspaper as well. According to the commentary included with the DVD, the medical personnel used in the hospital scenes were actual doctors and nurses so these scenes are completely realistic.<br /><br />McQueen is joined by a very young Robert Duvall who plays a cabbie, Robert Vaughn as an ambitious politician and Jacqueline Bissett, Bullitt's lover, who has difficulty with his chosen profession, worrying that he is becoming too involved in the awfulness of the cesspool of crime that he deals with daily. (But, Sweetie, that's what police officer do.)<br /><br />I certainly haven't seen all the cop movies ever made, but I cannot think of one that is any better than this one. Certainly a lot of television movies since \\"Bullitt\\" must owe a great deal to it. McQueen's Mustang chase scene is one for the ages.

B000HA4WTI|4.0|Put it this way this movie is not for everyone, period! its good for tuners and kids who love cars thats it. if you dont love cars or drive a piece of junk or is 90 years old and crippled watch something else. a lot of people had criticised the story line, what is there to criticise? youre watching a movie about cars and the underground world of drifting/racing whatever you wanna call it. go watch titanic if you want a good story line. for the people who likes to call themselves \\"proffesional\\" in racing, who thinks this is just antoher hocus bogus film will probably like the cars in the movie instead, theyre tricked out, nice body kits and performance mods, for that you have to buy the book: The Fast and The Furious: The Official Car Guide: All the Cars, All the Movies, it wont come with the movie. for the rest of the people just stay away from it if youre not even close to knowing what racing is all about. no point of watching something you dont like, theres more movies out there......
1594489505|5.0|I am always skeptical to read the next book by an author whose previous book I loved.  I loved Kite Runner.  I thought it was one of the best books that I've ever read.  So I was excited to read Hosseini's next book but somewhat worried that it wouldn't be as good.  After two nights of reading bliss, I can honestly say I was in no way disappointed.  I still can't decide which of these two books I liked best.  I've recommended it to everyone I've seen and we're reading it for our next book club selection.  I don't want to give anything away about the book -- just read it, your only disappointment will be that it had to end.

Life of Brian was outrageously fun from the beginning to the end. No doubt Python fans will enjoy the humor in this. Just enjoy it!!

0385522401|3.0|This review contains spoiler info....I'd been bowled over by everything I'd read previously by Ian McEwan (so far, Atonement, Enduring Love, and Saturday, but I'll get around to Amsterdam and Child in Time.) I love McEwan's ability to describe detail for detail, step by step, the progression of a moment. That skill is on full display in On Chesil Beach, but....my initial reaction was that it was only a pretty good short story, not a novel worth $22.00. I never felt as if the main characters were truly in \\"love\\"; instead, they seemed merely in an advanced state of \\"crush.\\" They clearly didn't know each other well, which is, in large part, McEwan's point. Hence, I found it less than credible that Edward would find it so hard to forget this \\"first love,\\" or she him, and that this one-year courtship and disastrous wedding night would forever scar these characters, no matter in what \\"era\\" they married. However, finishing this book is a little like viewing the last moments of the final episode of \\"The Sopranos\\" -- one may have an immediate sense of having been cheated of a satisfactory conclusion, but wake up the next morning thinking, \\"Brilliant -- the only way it could have ended!\\" So, upon further consideration, I'm looking forward to re-reading this book. I suspect that one of the main characters harbors a secret even more taboo in a repressive age than mere marital sexuality, and, in keeping with his \\"of the era\\" language, McEwan won't speak its name directly. Brilliant -- the only way it could have ended!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I could write a lengthy review.<br />I will not because this film needs none.<br />It was dark, erotic, violent, deep, and basic.<br />It touched the primal parts of my humanity.<br />So much today is concerned with socialization, cooperation, networking, brownnosing, surrendering, grudging responsibility.<br />This film shows the true nature of mankind as it was supposed to be.<br />Strong, honorable, wise, and lustful.
1594200823|3.0|I really wish I could give this book a better rating: The author's analysis of Americans' separation from their food was fascinating, and he explained the evils of industrialized food production better than I've seen anyone else do. The book is a bit frightening, actually: I get the impression that the right disease spreading among our industrial farms could paralyize the system and lead to disaster. He clearly points out that while there's much to be said for efficiency in food production, there's also a huge downside.  That said, Pollan interjects himself way too much in this book. Frankly, I don't care about the near-orgasmic thrill he got from hunting \\"wild\\" pig, nor do I care about his social inadequacies that were evident as he prepared a meal for his new-found friends.  A good editor would have made Pollan cut out most of the references to himself, eliminated the repetition and ended up cutting this book down to about half its size. Then I might have given the book five stars. There's plenty of interesting info about our food supply here, and Pollan certainly has a philosophy worth consideration, but there's too much self-indulgent blather to wade through to get to it.
B00000AFFF|4.0|Although nearly a decade-old album now, the 1998 \\"Painted from Memory\\" seamlessly (and now we already can say agelessly) teamed together one of the most prolific and influential pop music composer from the 1960's onwards and the punk era child prodigy-turned-traditional pop crooner (something distantly similar to Rod Stewart). Elvis somehow confirmed this move by his 2004 wedding to Diana Krall. The set of 12 original songs has considerably more highs than lows, with just about each of tracks offering a nice melody, an interesting instrumental solo or surprising subtle touches (some offer all of those). Not everybody will like Costello's sometimes a bit strained delivery, but the fact is that since the 1990's, pop has rarely been offering something this tasteful and classy. Another reason to give the album a chance. The highlight definitely is \\"I Still Have That Other Girl\\" (awarded a Grammy for best pop vocal collaboration), others include \\"This House Is Empty Now\\", \\"My Thief\\" and the title track.
1594489505|3.0|A Thousand Splending Suns provides a fascinating insight into the interior worlds of women in radically strict Islamic cultures.  Having said that, it is an inferior novel to The Kite Runner.<br /><br />I write those words with hesitation, as I know that readers may rush to Hosseini's defense, but let me be clear that the breakdown is not in his writing on a line-by-line, sentence by sentence basis.  He remains a very good writer. In this book however, Hosseini simply has less material to work with.  Unfolding over more than a decade, and starting with two completely separate characters who only come together at the book's midpoint, and then leaping a year or more at a time between chapters in the second half, Suns provides one hell of a narrative challenge. The monotony of the women's lives -- which is a horribly repressive, abusive, and seemingly unescapable monotony of violence and contempt -- is nevertheless too monotonous to be described on a day-to-day basis, and so the author's leaps in time are understandable.  Still, the technical challenge of sustaining dramatic tension, subtle character development, and the kinds of universal themes that he dealt with in Kite Runner, prove too much for Hosseini to completely juggle here.<br /><br />The result is a work that drives home the horror and hopelessness of the day-to-day world of these women, but where we have to have trust the author \\"telling\\" us of the comfort they draw from one another's relationship, because the leaps in time do not provide us (or Hosseini) with the opportunity to see those relationships developing subtly.  The larger-than-life themes of betrayal, loyalty, friendship and love that infused the pages of Kite Runner tend to land on these pages with more of an unsubtle thud.<br /><br />Again - Hosseini is a fine writer, and his ability to lead us inside worlds that, as westerners in particular, we rarely or never see - is superb.  I look forward to his next book.  But this one felt more like a sociological parable than narrative or literary fiction.han narrative or literary fiction.
B00003CX8V|4.0|As a lover of old Hollywood films, I consider Billy Wilder one of the most gifted filmmakers. Interestingly, \\"The Apartment\\" is at least the eleventh film I've seen from him, while some of them are still hard to come by for me (still waiting to come across \\"The Lost Weekend\\" and \\"Double Indemnity\\"). In the past few months, a local MGM channel showed \\"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"Love In the Afternoon\\", \\"The Fortune Cookie\\" and the dud \\"Irma La Douce\\". That said, I was waiting with high anticipation for \\"The Apartment\\" and...     ...well, as a movie full of cleverly put-together plot, with all Wilderian ingredients added and excellent performances throughout, \\"The Apartment\\" still left something to be desired with so high a profile (recently it ranked #80 in the latest AFI 100 American Films). One word occurs to me... this film is DATED, and more than a bit.    The truth is that the mercilessly honest look at shallow life of American corporate officials could ring unpleasantly true in the 1960, when the film got its important three Oscars. Since then, however, the times have changed and I think the passing time hurt the film considerably more than, for instance, the lighter \\"Some Like It Hot\\". Still, hats off to Wilder for one of his most poignant social commentaries ever put on the screen. Nowadays, filmmakers would not get away with depicting women as so naive creatures as this film somehow indicates they are.    Anyway, as you will see, I still rank \\"The Apartment\\" quite high in my personal chart of Wilder's films and I certainly won't throw \\"The Apartment\\" out of my collection. Just for the lovely Shirley MacLaine and spot-on Jack Lemmon and Fred MacMurray. And did I mention the laughs, too?    1. Sunset Boulevard, 2. Some Like It Hot, 3. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 4. The Apartment, 5. A Foreign Affair, 6. Seven Year Itch, 7. Love In the Afternoon, 8. Stalag 17, 9. The Fortune Cookie, 10. Irma La Douce, 11. Ace In the Hole (AKA Big Carnival)
6305657947|5.0|It's not often that a remake is better than an original, but since the original sucked fairly significantly, almost anything would end up being better. This one is spicy, funny and has some WICKED music (and I'm not particularly a music lover).<br /><br />Premise: insurance adjuster (hot chick) comes into town to investigate the theft of a famous painting. She meets and falls in love with the billionaire theif, and then has to cope with betraying her job or her heart...<br /><br />This movie has one of the best and most memorable scenes I've ever watched; the bit at the end where it all \\"comes clean in the wash\\".... funny as, and brilliant.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Made on a shoestring budget of $2 million, The Lives of Others is the most suspenseful psychological thriller I've seen in a long time, ranking with Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate. What's more, it presents one of the strongest pro-individual, anti-collectivist themes of any movie I've ever seen--all the more surprising because it hails from, of all places, Germany.     Its key lies in its title, which seems at first glance drippingly altruistic. The year, appropriately, is 1984, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is in his twentieth year as an agent of East Germany's dreaded Ministry for State Security, commonly known as \\"Stasi.\\" The \\"shield and sword\\" of the Socialist Unity Party, 100,000 Stasi agents and 200,000 paid informers hold the small Soviet satellite nation in a death grip, monitoring and controlling the lives of its 17 million citizens.     Captain Wiesler is a meticulous interrogator, ruthlessly wearing down suspects until they confess. An instructor at the Stasi academy, he trains future agents always to be on guard. \\"The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non-stop interrogation,\\" he instructs his students. \\"The enemies of the state are arrogant. Remember that. \\"     A humorlessly menacing man, Wiesler leads a lonely, Spartan existence in an antiseptic, sparsely furnished apartment in a concrete high-rise that houses many fellow agents. One day at the academy, his former classmate and current boss, gregarious Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), drops in with an assignment right up Wiesler's alley. One of their artists appears to be straying from the flock, and Wiesler has been assigned to watch him. However, the subject in question is no dissident, but the most celebrated playwright in East Germany, Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch)--a citizen so loyal to the Party that he believes his is \\"the greatest country on earth.\\"     Later that evening, spying from a balcony seat withopera glasses, Wiesler detects the mark of subversiveness on Dreymann's face as he watches the actors onstage performing his play. As Georg beams with proprietary approval, rising to applaud, Wiesler quietly utters to himself a one-word indictment that seals the dramatist's fate: \\"Arrogant.\\"     Georg lives with longtime companion Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck)--a radiant brunette who is as celebrated an actress as Georg is a writer (and to whom Wiesler clearly takes a fancy). While they are out of their flat, Wiesler's technical team descends upon their home, bugging the place. \\"Operation Lazlo\\" is now in full swing, and Wiesler and his partner monitor their subjects around the clock from the apartment building's empty attic.     At first, the surveillance of Georg and Christa appears fruitless. At a dinner party they host, a hysterical theatrical colleague (Hans-Uwe Bauer), who's suffered detention and psychological torture at Berlin's infamous Hohenschönhausen prison, accuses another director of being a Stasi informer. Georg is quick to defend the man against the accusation.     Yet, through the course of his work, Wiesler makes some rather ugly discoveries about the investigation. He learns that it was ordered at the behest of national Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), a porcine bureaucrat who's extorted sexual favors from Christa under the threat of blacklisting her. Wiesler also eventually finds his friend Grubitz's schmoozing to be a cover for vicious social climbing and discovers that Grubitz is complicit with Hempf's scheme to use Stasi as a cat's paw to eliminate Georg, his romantic rival.     Within Wiesler stirs a realization previously kept repressed: that his unquestioning faith in his country has enabled not his ideal of the perfect socialist state, but the hideous arrogance of avaricious thugs who run everything in the \\"workers' utopia.\\"     Where once was the heel-clicking impersonality of a robot, a conscience begins to grow. Wiesler comes to view Georg and Christa and their circle of bohemian friends not as specimens under a microscope, but as real individuals, with hopes and dreams, loves and heartbreaks. Having grown a conscience, he soon also yearns for a heart, as he silently assesses the utter emptiness of his own life.     Swept up in his subjects' personal lives, Wiesler's detached spying turns into voyeurism. But it isn't a perverted voyeurism, because, for the first time, the lonely captain catches a glimpse into a world of beauty, poetry, and music that is alien to his two-dimensional existence. Sympathetic to the predicament of these enemies of the state, Wiesler begins covering for them, faking his reports, and remaining silent about Georg's gradual disillusionment with the DDR after an old director friend (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide.     He overhears an argument in which Georg confronts Christa with knowledge of her affair with Hempf. Christa--already insecure about her talent--explains that she fears being blacklisted if she breaks it off. Wiesler feels compelled to protect her: He accidentally-on-purpose runs into her in a bar, pretending to be a fan, and tells her that her performances have inspired him. \\"Many people love you for who you are,\\" he says, sincerely. \\"You are even more yourself onstage than you are in real life.\\"     Christa dismisses his compliment, telling Wiesler he can't really know her. \\"Did you know that I would sell myself for art?\\" she asks. \\"But you already have art,\\" he counters. \\"That would be a bad deal; you're a great artist.\\"     Though his simple compassion, he gives Christa the strength to believe in herself and renounce her extorted affair with Hempf. But in doing so, Wiesler unintentionally sets into motion a nail-biting series of events that leads inexorably both to tragedy and redemption.     The Lives of Others is a superb film, top-drawer in every regard. Cathartic and ennobling, it recalls Fahrenheit 451 and We the Living in itspresentation of tragic heroes forced to examine their deepest-held yet deeply mistaken principles. Hagen Bogdanski's cinematography is compelling; through subtle differences in lighting he gives Silke Buhr's sets an additional dimension that places the characters in emotional context. Shot with tungsten-balanced film, Georg and Christa's incandescently-lit apartment radiates warmth; yet by capturing with daylight film the omnipresent, fluorescent-lit settings of the Stasi world, Bogdanski renders it cold and bloodless. Gabriel Yared's simple, haunting soundtrack is the perfect evocative counterpart for the action onscreen.     The acting is realistic, but never naturalistic. Martina Gedeck is a pleasure to watch, not merely because of her physical beauty, but for her impressive emotional range. Ulrich Tukur's capacity to turn on a dime from regular guy to cold-blooded manipulator is simply scary. And Sebastian Koch combines a physically imposing presence with a gentle, almost fatherly manner, reminding me of a younger Rutger Hauer.     But Ulrich Mühe steals the show as Wiesler. I have never seen an actor convey such a broad range of feelings within such narrow parameters. Where a Pacino or a Steiger would explode with ferocity, Mühe underplays, moving the audience with the sudden shift of an eyebrow, the drawing-in of a cheek muscle, or the quiet fall of a teardrop that betrays his sphinx-like façade.     Mühe began his acting career in communist East Germany. When government records were opened to the public after German reunification, he learned that his actress wife had been informing on him to the Stasi during the entire six years of their marriage. Clearly, he drew upon this reservoir of traumatic betrayal for this role.     The Lives of Others is flawlessly crafted, completely engaging the heart and mind. Most impressive is the fact that it's Henckel von Donnersmarck's feature film debut, released while he was still at the relatively young age of 32. In arecent interview, von Donnersmarck--who saw life behind the Iron Curtain first-hand when he visited family in East Germany as a child--spelled out his thoughts on communist repression as well as independent filmmaking:     \\"The [phrase] 'Independent film' makes sense to me only if it means that the director has full artistic control. How could a film be independent otherwise? ... I know that very well from East Germany: Until the Wall came down, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat had Final Cut on everything: novels, plays, films, even paintings. Make no mistake: hardly ever did they actually censor anything. But looking back at the art of those four decades, you can still feel the state in everything, and most of the art of that era is very impersonal and boring. Because the artists censored themselves, often without knowing it.\\"     Imagine my surprise, then, when the PC crowd at the recent Academy Awards ceremony--who feted environmental scam-artist Al Gore for his global warming crock-umentary--also bestowed the Best Foreign Language Film award upon The Lives of Others, rather than upon heavily favored Pan's Labyrinth. (I think Lives deserved the nod for Best Motion Picture overall, but I'm not unhappy that the Academy gave that award to director Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a consolation prize for snubbing him so many years.)     This cinematic masterpiece is a cause for celebration. Rarely has a filmmaker burst on the scene in such total command of his material. As a directorial debut, The Lives of Others belongs in the same company as Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. I can only hope that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has a Touch of Evil yet to come.
B00005JODK|5.0|This is another movie that I was not very exited to see. I had probably seen the preview millions of times and thought that the movie was just about a fat girl getting the chance of her life by dancing on a very popular show back in Baltimore, but as I sat through the movie, fell in love wit the characters and laughed my ass off, I realized that the preview was probably 25% accurate to the theme of the whole movie.    Hairspray follows the story of Tracy Turnblad (excellent performance by the newcomer Nikki Blonsky) a High School student who has a dream of dancing on the Corny Collins (James Marsden, the X-Men hunk) show next to Link Larkin (The High School Musical star Zac Efron). Tracy has been obsessed with the show since it started and her chance to actually try for a spot on the show opens up after one of the stars has a 9-month leave. After she is rejected for being to overweight by the mean Velma Von Tussle (the fierce Michelle Pfeiffer), and being sent to the detention for \\"hair-height\\", she meets Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), a student at her High School that not only has the same passion for dancing but that belongs to the \\"Negro Day\\" at the Corny Collins show. With Seaweed's help she learns new dance moves that blow out Link and he decides to take her to audition a second time and she actually makes it. After Tracy is accepted into the show this angers Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), who is, at the time, dating Link. Throughout the movie we learn that Tracy is a super lover fan of \\"Negro Day\\" and that \\"if she was elected president she would make everyday, Negro day\\". Negro day is a day dedicated to black kids on the show that is hosted by Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah). Tracy is very upset that the black kids can only dance once a month on the show, and decides to go on a march to \\"integrate\\" white and black kids on the show. Off course Velma and Amber won't let this happen, but as their plan seems to flourish it all falls flat when surprisingly Tracy comes with a plan and brings the black kids to join the show and the integration begins.  With the help of Tracy's parents, Edna (John Travolta)-- who surprised me a lot with a great performance-- and Wilbur (Christopher Walken), and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) --who was not as funny as I expected--, who falls in love with Seaweed, Tracy makes sure that her wishes for the black kids, and mostly herself, come true.    I have to say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. The jokes were really funny and the music was non-stop fun. There were some jokes that I did think were not as funny or didn't come across as funny, but the movie as a whole worked fantastically. Actors all did a great job and the crew behind it was really amazing, directing (Adam Shankman), custom design (Rita Ryack) and music composition (Marc Shaiman) were not left behind.     I think musicals are very hard to do, and even though not all of them are good, lately we have been hit with high quality musicals (Chicago, Dreamgirls, and Moulin Rogue!), and this is not the exception. I am sure you will go into this movie looking for what I looked for, but hopefully it becomes more than that once a review is read. I'm telling you see it. It is the guilty pleasure of the year. Hairspray needs a spray.
B000PMGS8G|1.0|{Flash! Ah-ah...}    How many years have we been waiting?    {He'll save everyone of us!}    How long have we heard about that \\"awesome UK release\\" with all the cool extras?    {Flash! Ah-ah...}    And what do we finally get?    {Savior of the Universe!}    The Savior of the Universe release with crappy cover art (give me the original poster art any day), a featurette about the artist who made the crappy cover art (doesn't Flash look wicked and more like Ming in it?), and a featurette about the screenwriter who also wrote the 60's camp classic Batman, as well as Never Say Never Again.    Worth the money? No.    Now that this is out, the people who have been selling the original DVD release for ridiculous amounts of money on eBay will have to settle for much less, and those who want to replace their old ones thinking this one will be a great buy will probably be selling their old ones for pennies. And that's the only thing good about this release!
1594489505|5.0|In his blog on this novel, Khaled Hosseini says, \\"it is a story about devotion, courage, self-sacrifice, and love.\\" He might have added oppression, exploitation, and abuse. Both heroines, Mariam and Laila, are enslaved by the cruel and abusive Rasheed, who regards both wives as vehicles to produce a male heir. Not even 30 years of war can remove the cultural mores of a male-dominated society. Though some of the characters exhibit the virtues mentioned above, the dominant impression is that in places like Kabul, women are not the primary species.
B000J103N4|5.0|I've always loved this album, and recently decided to add a digital copy to supplement the original LP.  I went for the surround-sound version because I've enjoyed the other classic albums (Pet Sounds, Workingman's Dead) that have been remixed for 5.1.  But none of them prepared me for the unbelievable experience of this one. When \\"Cowboy Movie\\" came on, I was about levitated out of my chair.  I have never heard such immediacy, clarity, or power from a 5.1 mix.  The sense of being in the middle of the mix is just tremendous.  High praise to Stephen Barncard, both for the job he did on the original recording, and for this terrific enhancement.
B00080ZG10|4.0|This is one of those movies which leaves you wondering why exactly it was made in the first place.  If you are part of the DiCaprio target demographic, you have no earthly idea who Howard Hughes even was, and fact this applies to pretty much anyone under the age 40.  Those of us in our early 40's are dimly aware of Hughes, while our parents will remember Hughes from the point where his story began to get really weird & really interesting.  Those of you who can remember the time covered in the movie...well, you are probably already dead or very nearly so.  This begs the question:  for whom was this movie made, and what story is it trying to tell?<br /><br />It is important to consider this, because the story really doesn't have an ending.  We get to see the Spruce Goose fly in 1947, but beyond that...who knows?  Does Hughes get crazier (he does).  Do his plans for TWA come to fruition (ultimately, they don't).  Does he make bigger & better movies (they are big, but they go from bad to worse --- John Wayne as Genghis Khan?  Enough said).  The movie is made with the assumption that the bulk of the audience knows ultimately how the story ends, but how can this assumption be made?  We, the movie-going audience, are left at a dead end.<br /><br />So why 4 stars?  Because up until the dead end, it is one hell of a ride.  For those of us who do know, more or less, how the bigger story ends, it is a glimpse at the Hughes who is less likely to be remembered than the reclusive nutjob occupying the top floors of assorted hotels for half a year at a time.  It is a remarkable story of a driven man, whose self-destructive demons were nonetheless the source of much of his achievement.  As the movie concludes, Hughes himself seems to accept that these warring aspects of his personality are interwoven to the point that he cannot have one without the other, and whatever may be in store for him in the future, it will be worth the price paid.<br /><br />So --- a qualified 4 stars.  Normally, I hate sequels.  However, if ever there were a movie which needed a sequel, it would be this one.owever, if ever there were a movie which needed a sequel, it would be this one.
B000063DIR|1.0|Most of the other reviewers have covered the topic of the remaster. Why write another review? Well, in my opinion there is no such thing as too many one stars for this abomination.    In case you haven't read the many other reviews, the story is that because the original rhythm section sued Ozzy for (allegedly) unpaid royalties and credits, Ozzy's camp decided to re-record brand new bass and drum tracks and mix those tracks with the original Randy/Ozzy guitar and vocal tracks. The finished product is the deservedly maligned 2002 remaster.    This is another item on the list of many small and petty acts by Ozzy's camp that really make it hard to be a fan some times. I am standing by my vow to never attend an Ozzfest again after attending a show where Sharon Osbourne had people in her road crew throw eggs at Ozzy's opener because she felt they were being unfair to Ozzy in the press. This is a prime example of how the Osborne camp reacts to situations like this. Deal with it in a public way, without any regard for the fans. Never mind the fans who paid over eighty dollars to see a particularly loved opening band (Iron Maiden) without having their set sabotaged. Never mind the fans who have heard \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary of a Madman\\" for 20 years with an iconic rhythm section of Daisley and Kerslake. This is odd behavior considering how much Ozzy, at times, seems to genuinely appreciate his fans. (Note: many soley blame Sharon, but I have no evidence for that; and find it hard to believe that Ozzy would be \\"blissfully ignorant\\" while Sharon replaced half the musicians on two classic albums.)    Now, do not get me wrong. Bordin and Trujillo are amazing players in their own right. Faith No More and Suicidal Tendencies are, and always will be, two of my absolutely favorite bands. My jaw still drops open at Trujillo's amazing funk-metal on the Infectious Grooves albums. His bass playing is one of the few things on those albums that ages well. Bordin's amazing drumming that varied from jazzy rhythms to death metal is part of what made Faith No More so influential and iconic.    Also let it be said that Daisley and Kerslake are not Geezer Butler and Bill Ward. Though incredible musicians, they are not as complex writers as some other who have played with Ozzy . I have read other reviews where people ask: If this is true, then why get so worked up over it? I mean, these are Ozzy's and Randy's albums, right? Why get so bothered when their recordings are getting replaced by people who, one could argue, are better artists?    Well, I have three reasons for my opinion against those arguments. First, D & K's simpler playing is a piece of what makes those albums work so well. To put it another way, Robert Trujillo would never, ever come up with so simple (and yet so blissfully memorable) a bass line as \\"Believer\\". I have been following Robert's work for many years and say that with deep confidence. On that same note, I can't imagine Bordin coming up with the iconic beats that open \\"Over the Mountain\\". If you can get a copy of the original version of \\"Blizzard\\", listen to \\"Steal Away (The Night)\\" and hear how Daisley and Kerslake hold back, allowing Randy to shine.    It's one thing to be a complex musician. It's quite another thing for a rhythm section to know when to hold back and give some space in order to serve the song better. Some refer to this talent as \\"knowing when NOT to play\\". This is the approach taken on \\"Blizzard\\". Later, on \\"Diary\\", it is amazing to hear Daisley and Kerslake introduce a little more complexity into their songwriting. A complexity that compliments, rather than counters, Randy. They give him more to work with. Hearing those two albums back to back, one can literally hear the growth of not only those two musicians, but of the entire band. This gets to my second reason for not liking the remasters. This band wrote and grew together. With the remasters the listener is denied the ability to hear musical growth happen as a complete band. The original masters act like aural snapshot for the time these recordings were made. It is a piece of musical history that should be preserved.    My final reason for not liking the remasters is simple. Giving credit where credit is due. No one but the band can know how involved Daisley and Kerslake were in the writing of this albums. Regardless, we all know they played on the album, and deserve the respect of having their contributions heard.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Wilco's incessant experimentation and growth between albums are instantly intriguing. Despite the fact that their work is often changing genres, it is always exciting. However, as is always the case, if you fell in love with Wilco because of the 'style' of one album or another, you might be disappointed here. The moody and sublime landmark 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,' with its amazing juxtapositions of griding guitars and harmonic acoustics, has evolved into 'Sky Blue Sky,' a more even keel work indicative of introspective, peaceful summer days. The earlier instrumental experimentation has, on 'Sky Blue Sky,' evolved into somewhat superficial and cliche solos.<br />This album is reflective in a way that no other Wilco album has been- it is somehow singular and introverted, as though Jeff Tweedy were singing only to himself.<br />Wilco's evolution is inevitable and admirable. It's the subtleties that I miss on this album- the storytelling, the raw experimentation.<br /><br />This is, if nothing else, what Wilco sounds like all dressed up with nowhere to go.

To stretch the truth one must first have facts to manipulate in the first place.  In the case of James Frey (no relation to that woman who was sleeping around with the Peterson guy who was convicted of murdering his wife in California) it is nothing more than a made of story, a fanstay if you will.  If you want fantasy read Piers Anthony, but if you want something in a modern day setting that is total fiction then just read this.  Why anyone cares about somebody who destroys their life and others and then asks for sympathy and makes money on it is beyond me, totally beyond me.  James Frey fooled a lot of people, including Oprah.

However, don't buy the dvd edition just because you think you are gonna get to see a small video or something from the actual Las Vegas show. The dvd is nothing but the LOVE background you have on your case, with the song that is playing at the moment. Which makes it a waste of money. But, don't let that discourage you from buying the CD.

B000MR9D5E|3.0|I love BBC through and through!  I just felt this was a bit lacking in the backing department.  I was under the impression that this was to be a series about the planet Earth, but it really came across to me early on as just some political hyperbole about the environment.  If I wanted to learn about that I would watch something from Gore, I was expecting this to be more of a general and fascinating documentary on the Earth and all nature's wonders.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|Did you know that in order to make a road trip movie, every single character on said trip must identify their fear, face that fear, and overpower that fear before the movie ends? No? Well, \\"LMS\\" seems to think this format is the only way to go.    With one of the finest comedic ensembles of last five years (Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Corell), \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is actually a lot of fun until Mr. Screenplay forces each member of the van load to have their \\"moment.\\" The characters ham-handedly, and very conveniently experience a \\"life changing situation/realization\\" on their way to the titular competition. The road this film is travelling down is awkwardly melodramatic and cheap. (How else to explain a character's realization that he is colorblind, watching him freak out about this news, and then completely cool down and move on from the devastating moment ... all within about 5 minutes of screen time?) We'd almost respect the film more if the characters had their moments at the same time, instead of a paint-by-numbers \\"Who's Next?\\" type of line-up.    Before the lesson plan however, the film and its cast shine. The first 30 minutes of the film have real promise as it teeters between comedy and tragedy, with each character wearing their respective dysfunction proudly on their sleeve. Abigail Breslin (though only 9 years old during filming, turns in an Oscar-caliber performance) plays \\"Olive\\", a character on the trip who is more or less the catalyst of the film. Breslin is entirely convincing as the easily excitable glue that holds the misfit family together, and breezily steals her scenes away from her costars.    \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is finally a disappointment: it creates some intriguing characters only to put them through a too-predictable cinematic therapy.

0743435729|4.0|\\"The Honor of the Queen\\" is the second book in a wonderful space opera series set some three thousand years in the future and featuring David Weber's best fictional heroine, \\"Honor Harrington.\\" The books are best read in sequence and I strongly recommend that you start with \\"On Basilisk Station\\" which is the first one.     Despite the futuristic setting, there are strong parallels with Nelson's navy. Assumed technology in the Honor Harrington stories imposes tactical and strategic constraints on space navy officers similar to those which the technology of fighting sail imposed on wet navy officers two hundred years ago. The galactic situation in the novels contains strong similarities to the strategic and political situation in European history at the time of the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.     This seems to be quite deliberate: many thinly veiled (and amusing) hints in the books indicate that they are to some extent a tribute to C.S. Forester, while the main heroine of the books, Honor Harrington, appears to owe more than just her initials to C.S. Forester's character \\"Horatio Hornblower.\\"     This book introduces the planet Grayson which is to become immensely important in future stories. When Honor Harrington first meets the inhabitants of Grayson in this book, they appear to be boorish, male chauvinist dinosaurs, and she has great difficulty dealing with them. However, it is a challenge which she eventually surmounts with flying colours.    A large number of important characters are also introduced in this book: and not just among Honor's Manticoran compatriots and her new Grayson allies. The two captains who the enemy \\"Peeps\\" have sent to stir the pot in Grayson will also feature in most of the forthcoming books - but not necessarily on the same side.      In this second book of the series, Honor Harrington has been promoted after her victory in Basilisk, and given command of the brand new heavy cruiser \\"H.M.S. Fearless.\\" She is also the seniorofficer of the military force escorting a diplomatic mission under her old mentor, Admiral Raoul Courvisier, to persuade the planet Grayson to ally with her home country, Manticore, against the looming threat from the People's Republic of Haven (Peeps.)    Grayson, in the Yeltsin system, was settled by religious fanatics. It turned out to have a highly poisonous ecosystem, which forced their descendants to amend some of their principles in order to survive. But their remaining prejudices, especially against women, initially make them difficult to deal with.    However, the Graysons are sweetness and light compared with the male rulers of the planet Masada in the neighbouring Endicott system. Descended from Graysons who went into exile after refusing to make the compromises necessary to prevent the planet killing them, the Masadans' ruthless sexism and intolerant bigotry make the Taleban look like a bunch of Episcopal feminists. They are still bent on revenge - and the People's Republic of Haven is only to happy to help them secure it.     Honor Harrington is going to have to go into battle against horrendous odds - again ...     This is another clever story with wonderful and believable characters, brilliantly described space battles, and a well crafted set of explanations of how the tactical situations in which the characters find themselves relate both to the technology their ships use and the political dynamics which set up the conflicts between them.     Many people read Weber for the space battles, and this book scores very highly here. In some of the later books of the series when describing major fleet actions, Dave Weber sometimes writes a bit too much like the wargame designer he once was, but he is superb when describing single-ship or squadron-level actions such as those in \\"The Honor of the Queen.\\"     Two aspects of this book may make some readers a little uneasy. At this stage of the series Weber gives full vent to his distrust of politicians, especially left-wing ones.     In later books, apparently to broaden the appeal slightly, he creates some extreme ultra right-wing reactionary politicians who he can criticise from the left so as to counterbalance his criticisms of socialists and liberals from the right. Weber thereby places the views of most of his sympathetic characters in the moderate centre of the Manticoran political spectrum. From book ten he also writes in one or two sympathetic liberal politicians! However, when he wrote \\"The Honor of the Queen\\" he had not made these adjustments.     Anyone with liberal or left wing views about economics or defence and security issues and who isn't willing to put them aside to enjoy a novel may be irritated by the political slant of the book. However, this slant is not as strong as that taken by some other military SF writers such as John Ringo.    The other aspect of the book which may be slightly uncomfortable for a minority of readers is the role of men and women. In respect of Grayson, the novel looks from a viewpoint totally committed to absolute equality between men and women at how a society which has gone down a different road can be persuaded to reform. In respect of Masada, their status as the bad guys is confirmed by their horrible crimes against women.     If you like this book, you will want to read the rest of the series. At the time of writing there are thirteen full length novels and four short story collections in the \\"Honorverse\\" as the fictional galaxy in which these stories are set is sometimes known. The main series which tells the story of Honor Harrington herself currently runs to eleven novels; in order these are     On Basilisk Station   The Honor of the Queen   The Short Victorious War   Field of Dishonour   Flag in Exile   Honor among Enemies   In Enemy Hands   Echoes of Honor   Ashes of Victory   War of Honor   At All Costs     The four collections of short stories set in the same universe, not all of which feature Honor Harrington herself, are     More Than Honor   Worlds of Honor   Worlds of Honor III: Changer of Worlds   Worlds of Honor IV: The Service of the Sword     The two spin-off novels are \\"Crown of Slaves\\" (with Eric Flint) which is a story of espionage and intrigue featuring a number of characters first introduced in earlier Honor Harrington books or short stories, and \\"The Shadow of Saganami\\" which is a kind of \\"next generation\\" novel featuring a number of younger officers in the navies of Manticore and her ally Grayson.     For amusement, if you want to try to look for the parallels to nations and individuals from the French revolutionary period and the Hornblower books, one possible translation would be:     People's Republic of Haven during books 1 to 3 = Bourbon France  People's Republic of Haven from book 4 onwards = Revolutionary France   Star Kingdom of Manticore = Great Britain   Gryphon = Scotland  Grayson = Portugal     Prime Minister Alan Summervale = Pitt the Younger   Hamish Alexander, later Earl White Haven = Admiral Edward Pellew   Honor Harrington = Horatio Hornblower   Alistair McKeon = William Bush     Crown loyalists and Centrists = Tory supporters of Pitt   Conservative Association = isolationist/hardline High Tories   New Kiev Liberals = Whig Oligarchists   Progressives and traditional liberals = Whig radicals     Anderman Empire = Kingdom of Prussia   Silesia = Poland   Solarian republic = United States of America
0316010669|3.0|I picked up this book after picking one of his articles \\"The Naked Face\\" from _The New Yorker_ for my Freshman Comp students to read, which he more or less cannibalized in one of the chapters in this book.  Yup, he plagiarized himself.  You bet I'm going to raise that issue with my students.<br /><br />Secondly, I didn't have a problem with his 'easy peasy' science as with the semi-socialist and contradictory conclusions about the whole 'thin slice' phenomenon.  In the penultimate chapter, he discusses the case of one Abbie Conant, who had to fight a horrendous legal battle to keep her position in an orchestra, all because the evil musicians made 'snap judgments' about her ability to play based on her gender--associating musicality with masculinity.  She got the job by auditioning from behind a screen.  Wonderful.  Yet, in the final chapter, where Gladwell is supposed to bring all of these disparate threads together, he suggests, I'm NOT kidding, that we have criminal defendants stand behind a screen as well, or be entirely removed from the courtroom, so that the judge can sentence them 'blind'.  This is comparing apples to fish.  When hiring a musician, one looks for musical ability.  When sentencing, I submit it's not beyond the purview of the bench to take into account such matters as 'does the defendant appear remorseful?' 'does he or she have future prospects of improvement?' 'does he or she have a history of recidivist behavior?' and other factors (beyond skin color) that weigh into a judge's decision.  Those factors *can* be assessed, as Gladwell himself argues, by 'thin slicing'.  Why is observing how a defendant behaves in the courtroom during the trial NOT acceptable thin slicing, when you ARE judging his character and ability to socially interact?  What he suggests is sentencing that a computer could do via a pretty simple algorithm.  We've TRIED mandatory sentencing and 'three strikes' policies, which attempt to remove race or class bias from the hands of judges (whom we apparently don't trust), and they didn't work.  Gladwell doesn't in the least suggest how his idea is really any different, or how it would be any more successful:  perhaps, if race is the issue, the issue is NOT with the judges but with the cops or district attorneys who decide to arrest or prosecute in the first case?  So, what?  Everyone's supposed to walk around with a bag over their heads so the (racist) cops can't see what color they are?  Crikey!<br /><br />Meanwhile, he doesn't address at all one of the more pressing, though smaller, perhaps, in scale, interests of the average reader: how can *I* use this in my life?  Not just 'buy cars on impulse, but debate about breakfast cereals', but in interpersonal interactions?  That's where most of his anecdotes focussed, but most of his prescriptions were not.  That sort of disconnect between ambitious social reform and interpersonal evidence is always suspect, because it leaves out the intermediate step: the small group.<br /><br />That being said, it's an easy read, and Gladwell is an entertaining stylist.  This is a book I'd recommend for plane trips or beach reading: enough to keep you interested, and intrigued, yet nothing that is going to significantly alter your paradigm.es (whom we apparently don't trust), and they didn't work.

0141182601|5.0|Rarely have a film and book inhabited such distinctive worlds of their own as those of 'A Clockwork Orange'. As a youth, I felt lucky to see a film so bizarre; as an adult I feel like I appreciate what so many others cannot. Burgess makes it clear through the introduction that Stanley Kubrick ignored the book's final chapter in his film, in which Alex grows up and grows tired of the ultra-violence and such. I was happy to read the 'lost' chapter, but the film had a lot more impact by letting the viewer guess where Alex's life would lead, that cheeky grin and those gleaming eyes hiding a new monster. I still enjoyed the book, although the film is so vivid it seems like the book is based on it, not the reverse. The liberal use of slang might put some people off, but it's repeated often enough that you'll catch on in no time. The story itself is impossible not to be intrigued by: do we prefer absolute morality in our society, or do we value choice so much that it sometimes comes at the expense of morality? I'll leave the tough questions to you, but there's no question this book deserves to be more widely-read. The film is so famous for being graphic and controversial that it often overshadows the story, which should always be the real star of the show.
B000PT6OY2|4.0|This isn't your usual Bond film.  It's almost believable.  There are not invisible cars, villans with steel teeth or some psycho with a laser out to destroy the world.  There is a lot of action but none of the usual toys, just guns, fast cars and beautiful women.  Not the run of the mill Bond film.  It's worth a watch.
1594489505|5.0|I read the kite runner in two days and was impressed.  I was able to have dinner with the author because of the shared reading program I helped establish at my university so I felt connected. This second book is equally great.  Its set during the same time period as the Kite Runner, but the main characters stay in Afghanistan. A Thousand Splendid Suns truly is a great book. It really gives you a feel for the way people felt during that time period in Afghanistan. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B000HIVOI2|2.0|I have always been a fan of this movie. I saw it on the big screen, I own it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. I don't really have anything to add to the many available reviews of this movie, but I will comment on the Blu-ray transfer.  The BD disc is easily the worst of the several Blu-ray discs that I own. Granted it's an older movie, well over 10 years, but the technology exists now to produce the best-ever transfer of this movie for the new HD formats. The fact that neither the picture or sound of this BD is scarcely better than the existing DVD transfer suggests to me that they rushed this out for a quick market share grab with barely any regards to quality.   If you already own this on DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray, at least not unless and until they produce a new, remastered transfer.

B00004XQ83|5.0|This motion picture soundtrack brings grins all around because each of the tracks associates so instantly with a scene from the uproarious film it graced with fine folk music, in the process generating something of a musical renaissance for those drawn to the genre.<br /><br />This is pure, early-twentieth-century, down-south Americana. It would be hard to find a more dignifying and elevating anthology of music to represent that slice of American history. This music is laced with humor and irony, putting the lie to the impression many people have that it's practitioners and their folk come from a benighted subculture between the coasts and in a chronological backwater.<br /><br />Listen and love it.

B00005JODM|3.0|This is going to be the second tough review for me this season.HAIRSPRAY fell flat! All that was teased was let down.    As a Baltimore boy myself who grew up and remember the significant events that shaped John Waters' original 1988 spoof on our town,I also saw HAIRSPRAY:THE MUSICAL twice on Broadway in 2002-3.Though altered somewhat from the source material, there was still a magical and infectious feeling that one got watching the big basso-profundo Harvey Fierstein ,in his Tony Award winning performance, lumber across the New York Stage as the Amazonian laundress Edna Turnblad.Fierstein,probably New York's most beloved actor, as a huge gay man, was the first musical incarnation since the irreplaceable late Divine(Baltimore's native \\"son\\")originated the role in Waters' break-out flick.The 300 pound  Divine,as well as the scratchy-voiced Fierstein,WERE \\"hefty-hideaway-chicks\\".  These naturally behemoth  men WERE the ever-dieting ironing (arning) maven desperately trying to cope with the ever-changing \\"rock'n'rollers\\" that were changing the course of social history in this town!.In fact,Glenn Milstead (Divine) was ALWAYS John Waters' leading lady!He, like Fierstein, knew how to BE a woman!( See Harvey Fierstein in TORCH SONG TRILOGY.See Divine in FEMALE TROUBLES,PINK FLAMINGOS,POLYESTER and LUST IN THE DUST.)     Here then is my biggest rub,Hon!: John Travolta was not Edna! Clad in mountains of rubbery flesh and tons of cakey make-up, Travolta's facial features were as stiff as a newly over-Botoxed victim that turned his dialogue into complete and incomprehensible mush. The \\"fat suit\\" drew way too much attention to itself in a badly performed cosmetic stunt.Travolta's Edna Turnblad is never a \\"real\\" woman.She instead is turned into a prosthetic caricature  that in no way captures the original movie or stage \\"Edna\\" who was a real-feeling and breathing \\"woman\\".Divine's and Fierstein's natural \\"largess\\" flowed effortlessly, fat rolls and all! John Travolta, on the flipside, is always a man encased  in mounds of artificial flesh...and not at all funny.His rubber suit floats and bounces with the wind and Christopher Walken , who was thoroughly convincing as husband Wilbur in a much-expanded part, needed to steer clear as Travolta may have floated into the air at a seconds notice! Travolta would have never been my choice.The hugs and the unashamed kisses that Fierstein and Dick Latessa freely shared on stage as the loving and hotly attracted Edna and Wilbur  wowed 'em in New York as those two men sexily and playfully romped through the softshoe \\"You're Timeless to Me\\".Here two men lightly Fred Astairishly tip-toe mostly holding hands beneath Edna's airing laundry, free of all overt sexiness (remember Wilbur was HOT for chubby chicks!) that made audiences applaud wildly as the couple kissed and embraced, free from all hang-ups.Broadway breathlessly waited for that magical moment! Here, Travolta reclines in a chaise,fat suit practically eating him up, and Wilbur dampens the candle.Would it have been too much to see Walken and Travolta kiss? At least THAT would have been true to the characters!In fact, even the \\"French kissing\\" of Tracy and Link is totally removed.Anything that was sexy and crass....GONE WITH THE FAT SUIT!!!     Hollywood needed  a big named star to attract all audiences to a musical that many folks never would have seen otherwise  on a live stage.If you have seen the original movie and the stage musical,the 2007 version strays unfortunately even further(ESPECIALLY the ending that betrays both previous versions thus severely altering the whole intent!!!) If this HAIRSPRAY is your first intro to Baltimore, than chances are you will be far more entertained than I was.The dancing is contagious...the humor,sexiness and infectious obsurdity that was John Waters and even Broadway is faded like a bad dye job. What once made HAIRSPRAY outrageously funny and edgey is as tamed and relaxed as Pia Zadora's ironed hair in Waters'cult classic about his home town.       The expanding of Velma Van Tassle's screen time to the point of adding a totally unnecessary seduction scene because Michelle Pfeiffer's contract may have called for it was ludicrous. The scene was long and drawn out, and again, not funny.Her enunciation in \\"Miss Baltimore Crabs\\" was deplorable! Again...big star...not funny!There is a MAJOR difference the way \\"stage\\" actors inhabit these characters verses the manner in which \\"film stars\\" do the same.A tremendously slimmed-down Pfeiffer looked good, but that was it: not a singer...not a dancer!    Queen Latifah?...spot-on casting! Her deeply soulful singing of \\"I know where I've Been\\" as the kids marched on WYZT still is the number that brings the house down every time on Broadway! On the other hand,\\"Big Blonde and Beautiful\\" was severly edited, losing all that is so positive and right about this song of affirmation for the \\"plus-sized\\" woman...black or white! There are two new numbers written for the film version.    That said...where this film hits all of the right notes is in the outstanding choreography of Adam Shankman who really did his homework in recreating the  dances that prevailed in the black and white youth of the time. Every step was a piece of \\"the mashed potato\\", \\"the watusi\\",\\"the pony\\",\\"the hully-gully\\" \\"the bird\\" and \\"the funky chicken\\"! Any youth who danced on Baltimore's Saturday- must-see The Buddy Deane Show, the \\"real\\" Corny Collins Show, will be overwhelmed and overjoyed at how energetic and totally accurate Shankman's dances are.They are slick, full of exaggeration and high energy. The white dances are more naturally subdued and contained for \\"the nicest kids in town\\"-\\"nice WHITE kids\\". The black numbers are sexy, sensual and so full of unrestricted body movement that THIS is the reason we white kids longed to be with our black friends as much as they wanted to be with us.We loved their \\"MOTOWN\\" music and they wanted equal dance time with us. Music anddance WAS our common bond in a city  dominated by segregation. This is WHY we picketed WJZ-TV Channel 13 in Baltimore. For Shankman's masterful dance routines, this HAIRSPRAY stands-out even over the Broadway musical.It is the newcomers, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly and James Marsden that bring pizazz to this film.They perform as the fresh,young,naive and totally optimistic \\"hair-hoppers\\" that we were.Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton?...eh!!!Allison Janney as her mother fared better.Why was Mrs. Pingleton reading with \\"cross\\" bookmarks and performs an exorcism? Baltimore was then a predominantly Roman Catholic town.Things were strict.Lines were not crossed.    What continues to be diluted,though, as HAIRSPRAY dances to success, is the original ridiculous,crass humor and justified stereotype of our \\"hick town\\" that made (and still makes) \\"Bawlmer\\" so completely bizarre so much so that John Waters' penned his HAIRSPRAY in the first place. When Baltimore saw the original movie premiere at our historic Senator Theatre in 1988, the WHOLE town laughed at itself and it was THE single highlight that black and white locals shared together.We are a hung-up,carss and very diverse lot,here! Yesterday,we all sat in the theatre at the premiere ....and not a single laugh, except for John Waters' cameo as \\"the flasher\\" in the opening number \\"Good Morning Baltimore,was heard for the 107 minutes of pulse-pounding entertainment. We silently got up from our cushy seats,people did not stay for the credits ( a hallmark of moviegoers in Baltimore),more than a little deflated puzzling in ourselves, \\"Where was our Baltimore?\\" ....It had disappeared in a nostalgic time warp that was somehow lost in translation even further as our \\"Ultra-Clutch-High-Haired-Wannabe-Po'Dunk\\" city slipped beneath rubber suits, Hollywood A-List actors and razzle-dazzle choreography and editing.What had made HAIRSPRAY so original was gone along with the 1960's.None of us spoke. We all filed out too afraidto speak what was really on our minds: all that was funny was sprayed away!

B000NVIGC0|4.0|I know it's hip to scrutinize a band's intentions, personal backgrounds, blah blah blah, but whatever happened to just listening to the music?  Yes, Wilco has been experimental, using dissonance and space to create compelling noise.  This time, they wrote songs that could actually be played on the radio (the nerve!) and listened to while mowing the lawn (how dare Wilco make a fun record!).  I am a Wilco fan from the beginning.  First record, OK.  Second, became a great American band.  Third, tried too hard.  Fourth, became pretentious to their success.  Fifth, remained pretentious to their detriment.  Sixth, made a very thoughtful, cool record.  Remember when Radiohead made \\"The Bends\\" and we could all sing along?  Then Thom Yourke decided he should change the world and use an Atari 2600 to write \\"songs\\"?  Let's hope Tweedy realizes that his fans like to hear the great songs only Wilco can write.

B000PFUAO6|3.0|First I would like to say, I am a very dedicated DT fan and all JP and MP solo work. Live, the whole group is flawless, and they pay close attention to sound quality and stay true to the studio version of each song played. The first time I heard DT years ago, I was was floored! Their music was like an answer to a prayer for someone that had reached \\"burnout\\" stage with all other prog-rock groups.  These guys (all 5 members) are incredibly talented and never cease to amaze musically. But, in my opinion, not all of these songs seem to fit the DT maturity level. \\"Constant Motion\\" has a VERY predictable vocal melody closely resembling Metallica, which is a kick in the nuts to LaBrie, who is an excellent vocalist - he can do way better than this! Also, Portnoy's backing vocals are kind of annoying on that track #3. They should let LaBrie do his job. I would not be suprised to find out that LaBrie and Rudess end up going somewhere else in the near future. Even Rudess' keyboard wizardry is somewhat stifled on this album. Track #1 (In the presence of enemies Part 1) is very fresh melodically where as Track #8 (Part 2) is dark, directionless and even corny? Dark Master.........what the hell?. Track #4 is very dark and hard lyrically, which is fine if your 17 years old and like thrash. Track #6 (Prophets of War) is good but isn't it time to quit talking about war in the east? This is the 3rd-album-in-a-row to have such a song. Find a new topic already. All the rest of the tracks are just \\"ok\\" compared to what they are cabable of. They climaxed with the album \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", no doubt about it. I thought with that being Rudess' first DT release that it would have gotten better and better. None of the DT albums since have matched SFAM. I am still dedicated to DT music and hope they will rise above the \\"kid thrash\\" phase, and get back on track again. Sorry die-hards, but I have to be honest.

0345494768|5.0|As a below-average Star Wars fan (I hadn't seen the Trilogy in 4 years before I picked up this book on a whim), I found this book to be a treasure trove of fascinating detail about the making of one of the most successful films of all time.    The book itself is beautiful - that cover just screams \\"Read Me!\\".  Piles and piles of original artwork, sketches, models and photographs really round out the text of the book itself, which is full of first-hand quotes and original documents.  One of the high points is reading all the summaries of the various drafts of \\"The Star Wars\\", as it was known originally.  The evolution of Lucas' thought process over three years is fascinating - the influences that formed the film initially, and those that took over as time went on.    I can't recommend this book enough.  An inspiring book about an inspiring movie, this is a must-read for casual fans and die-hards alike.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|2.5 stars.  I'm all for artists taking risk and I sincerely hope Kelly worked out whatever she needed to work out during this process, and we all can just move on.  This cd sort of reminds me of what you would hear at a college pub.  When the artist on stage clearly has \\"potential\\" to grow.  And that is what Clarkson song-writing ability holds.  Potential.  It, however, was nowhere near ready to be released to an unsuspecting public.  There are so many awkward composition transitions that several times I would stop what I was doing to frown at the CD player. Can Kelly Clarkson sing? Absolutely.  But this production needed a whole lot more work before it should hit the shelves.  After Never again, I'll be interested to see what Ms. Clarkson thinks is another releasable single.  Sober and Be Still-are descent (could have been great, if she had some more help on composition).  Seriously the whole packaging and switch in style looks to me like Ms. Clarkson has Evanescence envy.  Would have loved it, if Kelly had recorded her version of Annie Lennox's \\"Why\\".  She did such a wonderful job of that live, I just knew she would record it.  But alas...<br />Overall: Skip this and relisten to Breakaway.

B000EGFVQS|4.0|As a writer Alice Sebold should be revered as a modern classic wordsmith.  Her prose is hypnotic and poetic.  She can grab a moment, both tragic and beautiful, and make the reader long to take it in no matter the effect.  Especially moving were her sentences about the \\"Abigail\\" photo, and the \\"brokeness\\" in people that can be seen.    The story, especially the ending, was my only hang up.  I don't want to spoil it with detail but you will know exactly the moment it seems like Alice got real tired of writing.  Despite the very humanistic appeal, I hope there are some aspects of Alice Sebold's heaven that are true.  Peter Jackson has quite a surgical procedure ahead of him to fix this ending.
0895260131|1.0|While I do agree that people are free to write whatever they want on any subject, including religions, as much as I am always surprised to read books that use \\"facts\\" out of context to prove points that are the opposite of the truth. Spencer did exactly that. For someone who is not a scholar in al balagha, which Arabic syntax, whic is an important component to read Al Koran and Al Hadith, I find his statements baseless. Islam is a religion of peace. The life of Prophet Mohummad is a testimony. Whenever he was in war, he protected women, children, the environment...When a city did not want to \\"convert\\" to Islam, its dwellers just needed to pay \\"taxes\\" and they were free to believe whatever they wanted.  The injustices that may happen in modern Islamic societies now are either due to a misinterpretation of Islam or to traditions. By the way, there is a difference between Arab and Muslim. They are not synonymous. It is a mistake that exists in the book and I saw in most of the comments on the book. If we take Western societies, astrocities happen.  Should we hold Christianity or Judaism responsible? Or, let's take even Asian countries, should hold Buddhism responsible?  Man is the heart of evil.<br />I think that Westerners are wasting their time trying to attack Islam because there are other issues that are more important that are demolishing these countries from within. The same is also happening in Muslim countries.  Humanity is definitely in danger because of these messages of hatred and contempt.
1416523359|5.0|I'll admit, I had some trouble getting into \\"Lisey's Story,\\" despite being a longtime King fan. The language is a little distracting. The flashbacks are sometimes outright groove-killers. (You know, you're reading, you get into the groove of the story, then BAM! You're taken out of it? Yeah, that happens a few times in this book, unfortunately.) That being said, this book is absolutely, positively beautiful, and I highly, highly recommend it.    You may find yourself, as I did, really forcing yourself to get through some passages. \\"Lisey's Story\\" is not an easy read, for two reasons: the distractions I mentioned in my first paragraph, and also the emotions. The love story, which is what this book is, at heart, despite the musings about demons and alternate worlds, is what really sold this book for me, as well as what made it so hard to finish. (I apologize for that horrendously long sentence, but hopefully you understood it all well enough.)    \\"Lisey's Story\\" is a beautiful love story, if you can pull yourself through it. (I cried at the end, and books hardly ever make me cry.) :-) Perhaps it's just me, coming from my own issues over losing loved ones, but there were parts of the book that hurt to read. But more than that, there were parts that were breathtakingly beautiful. It also made me rethink my definition of love, but then again, I am still young and impressionable, so forgive me if it turns out that King is actually presenting a rather unrealistic relationship between two people.    Anyway, if you can commit to it, and plow your way through the first half of the book, you'll find the second half not so hard to swallow. It flows better - it did for me at least - and it wraps up together quite nicely in the end. You won't be disappointed. Whatever you do, DON'T GIVE UP ON THIS BOOK! No matter how hard it is to get through at first, please try to get at least halfway before judging it. You won't regret it, I promise. :-)    I do hope I'm not scaring anyone outof reading this book. This book is worth reading, but it won't be easy, for the two reasons I mentioned and more. I recommend it to anyone who loves Stephen King. I'm not sure how well it will go over with those unaccustomed to King's style of writing. I was beginning to think it was going to be a straight love story, and then all this weird stuff started happening, and I realized, \\"Ah, yes. This is a Stephen King book, after all.\\" Of course there's going to be an alternate nightmarish world beyond our own. :-)    So all in all, it's not what I would call King's \\"BEST\\" work (I don't know if anything can top \\"The Stand\\") but for me, it excels on an entirely different level than most of King's other novels. There's the love story, yes, but there's also a bit of a personal element to it too. It's about the widow of a writer. King says it's not his wife, that Tabitha King is not Lisey, but you know that there had to be at least some moments inspired by their real life together, and it shows. You can feel it in the writing. And it just moves me to think about what life must have been like for the two of them over all of these years. (We get some idea of it from reading \\"On Writing.\\" Tabitha's reaction to hearing how much King had earned for the paperback rights to \\"Carrie\\" is one of the high points of \\"On Writing\\" for me. Two against the world, you know?) It moves me even more to think about what it might be like for Tabitha after such a huge force of nature as King passes on. I cannot begin to imagine what it's going to be like for her, but King does it for me somewhat, with \\"Lisey's Story,\\" even if it's not completely autobiographical. But I'm getting WAY off-subject now...    And finally, the biggest thing that hit me after reading the book is how, if King had really retired a few years back like he said he would (I have the copy of \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" with his mug on it, proclaiming that he was \\"done\\" with writing), we would have never had the chance to read this. I am so grateful for this book. No, it's not perfect. No, not everyone will like it. But the fact that King is still alive, still writing, and was able to produce what he calls one of his best books (especially after that incident with the van)...? I'm really thankful for that.    If King wants to write a sometimes sappy and somewhat disjointed love story for his wife, then power to him. I hope I can find a guy someday who's crazy enough to write something like this for me. ;-) I'd give it 4.5 stars, but since I can't do that, I'll give it 5, just because I think the average rating should be at least 4 stars...
0375831002|4.0|I was a little put off by this book at first. The idea of \\"Death\\" as a narrator just didn't seem to work. Having finished the book, I am still not totally sold on it, not because it wasn't a great idea, but more because it was difficult for Zusak to stick with it, in my opinion. He often seemed to forget that was who was telling the story, and would have to somewhat awkwardly reinstate it from time to time. That being said, I felt the story itself was outstanding. It almost seems a shame to call this \\"young adult\\" literature because it is really appropriate for adults as well. The imagery in this novel is often amazingly beautiful. The author clearly has the gift of being able to craft eloquent, poignant, and haunting language. I think he is able to tell a story that is very approachable to younger readers, but doesn't sugarcoat the atrocities. It gives the reader a sense of history without being so heavy that is a completely exhausting experience, as (understandably) most Holocaust stories are. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it. Educational, but not didactic. Entertaining, but not flippant. Not an easy line to walk. Bravo!
1582701709|4.0|I knew most of the principals this book suggests, but it never hurts to have a reminder.  Think positive ALWAYS, think life into your life.<br /><br />I have already experienced the power of thinking positively and am already drawing more wonderful experiences into my world.  Buy it, read it, keep it nearby for a constant reminder that your goal-directed thoughts are relevant and necessary to get what you want out of life.

B00009V7P8|3.0|This CD is somewhat repetitive, but the intensity and meaning just blares though.  Most songs are haunting, not light lyrics or melodies by any stretch, but great for soul-searching periods in your life.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|this is a great album.  admitedly, I had very little Wilco in my music vocabulary to begin with.  i had heard a few songs here and there and had a few songs in compilation cd's, but i kind of knew I would like them.  I was not dissapointed.  Kind of a greatful dead sounding folk / roots sound.  I got the copy with the dvd.  the dvd is cool with the interviews and live performances in the band's studio.  kind of get the feel of hanging out with them.  *****

074356619X|5.0|I had heard from some of my friends about The Secret, so I wanted to check it out for myself.  I got the CDs right before a road trip and listened to them all the way home.  It was truely life changing how positive and hopeful I felt as I started putting into practice some of the ideas from this book.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|My Rush fanatic friends and I we're going to wait until the Snakes & Arrows concert before forming an opinion.  The music didn't seem familiar - as a Rush album should sound like - on the first listenings and some of us we're a little puzzled.      Geddy said in an interview, \\"We wanted to do a couple of different things musically and present a fresher, more original approach. We wrote a lot of acoustic and bass and tried to make sure we were not seduced by techno. The aim was to produce intelligent melodies and songs that were strong and meaningful, and I think we did.\\"    I agree.  Fresher and original.    After a couple of months (and about 10 listenings) and a rocking concert, the music from this album just rocks.  Very powerful.  On the way home from the venue and the next week, the first 7 songs of this album didn't leave me.  From the concert, the old familiar tunes were completely out done by the songs from this album.  I believe they played 8 of them.  They've definetly departed on something new, it just takes sometime to appreciate.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|From a plot standpoint only, this movie is rather mundane.  A greedy railroad owner wants to take a widow's land and hires gunmen to drive her off, kill her, or buy the land cheap.  And there is an obligatory gunfight, a street faceoff.  This said, why do I think this is a masterpiece?  For several reasons.    First of all, director Sergio Leone takes his time to give the moviegoer a thorough picture.  The film starts with three gruesome gunslingers in a miserable hovel of a railroad station, waiting for the train, which is late.  The windmill squeaks.  Water drips.  A telegraph key clicks.  A fly lights on one of the men's chin and he is too lazy to brush it off.  It crawls.  He blows on it.  Finally he captures it in the barrel of his sixgun.  And then the men wait and wait.  And we get a sense of the heat, the ennui, the dust, the cacophony of the wind and fly and windmill.    Second, there are is the acting.  Henry Fonda as a sadistic killer, completely out of character for him.  Jason Robards as a mysterious escaped convict.  Charles Bronson as a man with a mission--but one we are not privy to until near the end.  Finally, there is Claudia Cardinale, a pinup girl, to my thinking, who does a marvelous job as an ex-prostitute from New Orleans who has just come west to find her husband of one month, has just been murdered.      Fonda and Robards are old pros; we expect them to be good.  The surprises to me were Bronson and Cardinale.  They are absolutely first-rate actors under Leone's direction.  There are too many minor roles of note to mention, but Jack Elam and the old man at the train station deserve considerable praise.    But perhaps the director is the real star here, his vision, his careful, meticulous feel for the west.  It may seem odd that a foreign born director would be the one to have this talent, but it may be that as an outsider he saw more, was intrigued more by the past in the Wild West.    Finally, there is the atmosphere, the panorama, the trains, the desert, John Ford's Monument Valley in a whole new light.  There is no neat western town with nice flat streets and no horse manure on them.  The town is rough, ugly, dirty, scattered, mean.    If I find one fault with the accuracy, it is with the very white, capped, flossed and brushed teeth of the actors.  I found the dental perfection distracting.  One suspects that at least one figure from the Old West had crooked incisors, a missing bicuspid or two--or did the director think they were all caries immune?
0553278398|3.0|I read the original foundation series a year ago and just now read Prelude.  Prelude starts off interesting but bogs down in the middle.  I put the book down for days at a time before finally getting through to the end.  The original trilogy was filled with plot twists driven by edgy logic.  Once the plot twist revealed itself you could think back to the clues that hand been given in advance and marvel at how it all made sense.  Prelude is largely absent this style until the last 50 pages.  The end of the book is quite entertaining, if you can make it that far.  BTW, if you are more interested in a visionary interpretation of the distant future, read Arthur C. Clarke's 3001.  It's light on plot but his vision of the future is fascinating.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|No idea how I stumbled across the album, but I find it to be an amazingly fresh, yet familiar collection of songs.  The band is extremely tight . . so many terms could be applied - crunchy, razor-sharp, melodic.  It takes brilliant musicians to make it sound so effortless - yet interesting.    And then there's Strummer's voice - perhaps the most amazing instrument of the bunch.  It's working class all the way - but so special and soft (I keep thinking young Brando? . .it's tough but beautiful).  Can you think of anyone who sounds like Strummer?  I cannot . . .and I find the emotion he can deliver to be so true - there's simply no false note, no feigned feeling in any track.      Couple of songs that deserve mention: \\"Coma Girl\\" is a great song  . . and it kills me the way he sings \\"gang\\" . .. it's tough man . .tough and melodic.  Brilliant song . .lots of fun - the eternal detached artists longing . . .    Get Down Moses is my favorite track of the CD.  How can a guy from working class England have such a deep reggae soul?  He just owns the genre . . .and makes it is own with his distintive phrasing / emphasis.  Lyrics are biblical - both in nature and scope . . .so, SO few could get away with singing lyrics like this.  I consider myself the ultimate outsider . . .but get the feeling I'd follow Joe's crusade with songs like this.  They move me man.    All in a Day is a razor of guitar and energy.  Big back beats pound a frenetic pulse and one thinks of the Beatles song \\"woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head\\" but COMPLETELY modernized to the frenetic times we live in.  This is Red Bull in the morning - not the cup of Joe.    What's most impressive to me - again - is Strummer's voicings across a wide variety of meters / melodys.  In an age when the word \\"genius\\" is so overused I feel compelled to say that Strummer was more than a genius . .but a truly unique artist . . .absorbing so many influences but stamping his signature on all of them.
0060899190|5.0|(This is a large book.) Overall - artistic, a unique and novel concept, and often incredibly moving. When I read from it, it makes me feel human and connected to others. It makes me realize how vulnerable others are. Often we don't realize what people keep under wraps; perhaps if we pondered some of the vulnerabilities revealed on the postcards within this book, we might be kinder to one another.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just love this show.  I am a guy who rewatches movies but rarely watches the extras outside the gag real.    I have watched every episode with the comments on multiple times.  Have watched everything I can get associated with this series. Have watched the series without dialog so I can catch anything in the background I may have missed (not that having dialog means anything to me because I can quote every line).  Watched the episodes with chinese translations handy so I can catch all the sayings.  Simply put I am a fanatic for this show.  I have never fell in love with a show and characters as quickly as I fell in love with the characters in this show.  Buy this.  You will not be disappointed.
B000LPS47U|5.0|The added bonuses included with this version of Re-Animator are worth the price of admission!  The 70 plus documentary \\"Re-Animator Ressurectus\\" was excellently put together and includes almost entirely new never before seen shots of storyboards, behind the scenes stills and of course interviews with nearly the entire team that made this film.  I can state that this is the real deal!  I'm part of that team and this is the first look back at Re-Animator that got it right!
1878424319|5.0|I loved this book. Normally I'm not into anything that even comes close to the realm of \\"self help\\". What makes this book so great is that it is a reminder of the principles of life that everyone should follow. This is not about trying to get you to convert to another religion or telling you that your way of life is not good enough. I would call this fine tuning. Even if this is something that you don't want to get into, it's great to read something that will make you think.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Not your typical heist movie - very intense and unpredictable. A few scenes are particularly memorable, such as the scene in which Owen's character instructs the police to focus their cameras on the second floor window. Wow, that was shocking and eerie.<br /><br />Foster, Owen, Washington, and Plummer are on the short list of actors I admire. Lee has not been one of my favorite directors, but I love this movie, especially his attention to detail. For example, the bank used to be a Fallout shelter - you can see the yellow and black sign as people go down the stairs to the basement. I really liked the camerawork in the beginning, with closeups of statues and signs. Interesting soundtrack too, beginning and ending with an exotic Indian song that alludes to the multiculturalism of the setting and cast.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, Lee is clearly obsessed with breasts. This detracts from the maturity of this movie. Watching males act how they typically do around breasts is pathetic and demeaning to women AND men. I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could - sorry, I decided to round down instead of up.<br /><br />I used to work for a bank but was never involved in a robbery. The few mistakes of this movie, and most bank robbery movies, occur during the vault scenes.  The money is not supposed to be spread out on shelves, in plain view of whoever goes into the vault. It's really stored in steel lockers with separate combinations. It irritates me that most people imagine the money to be lying around, unprotected. Responsible banks wouldn't operate in that way. I realize this is just a movie, but give some credit to the bank for keeping the money properly protected. And give those security guards handguns.
6301973410|4.0|It is night along the coast. Shots are heard, a man falls to the floor. A car drives away. A woman stands on a pier until a policeman talks to her. Then a man meets her and offers a free drink. They talk about the past, then return to the beach house. Wally's talk tells about his character. Wally finds a man's body, Mildred has left. The police arrive to find Wally leaving the house. When Mildred returns home she finds the police waiting to take her in for questioning about the dead man. A detective takes all the pieces about a murder, puts them together, finds out the motive for the murder, then arrests a suspect. [No scientific investigation at all? Not even a paraffin test? When they find the first likely suspect the investigation ends. But better investigatory techniques are coming from advances in criminalistics.]    The film shows Mildred's past life with her first husband Burt Pierce. He is out of work. Mildred is devoted to her two daughters. Her married life breaks up over their difficulties. Burt's friend Wally comes over and invites himself in. Would Wally pull a cheap trick? Mildred's oldest daughter has expensive tastes. [Where did that come from?] Mildred learns it is hard to get a job without experience. But she finds a job as a waitress and does real good. At home she baked pies for the restaurant. Daughter Veda is a spoiled rotten snob. Mildred hopes to open her own restaurant, and finds a suitable property. Her business plan convinces Mr. Beragon to sell the house.    Mildred works hard to make her restaurant a success. She applies for a liquor license. Her life seems to be improving. Beragon is a wealthy heir who has an empty life. Then her youngest daughter catches pneumonia, a fatal disease before antibiotics. Mildred's hard work and management made her restaurant a big success, with other locations. The story now jumps to the murder investigation. The police have learned more about Mildred's activities that night. Wally Faye warned Mildred about Beragon - he is a parasite. Veda has been borrowing money from Mildred's employees. The character of Monte Beragon is revealed by his actions.    Mrs. Forester, Ted's mother, objects to Veda's romance with Ted. Veda has married Ted! But now Veda wants to end this marriage - for $10,000. Mildred learns about the horrible character of Veda and throws her out of her house. Mildred takes a vacation in Mexico [no reason given]. Mildred finds out that Veda is a singer at Wally Faye's bar; she has a new life. Monte Beragon is down to selling off the family mansion. [Is this a comment on his character?] Monte will make a deal for a marriage to Mildred. Will Mildred do anything for Veda? Soon Mildred's creditors are demanding payment, and she finds out how she was betrayed. [No surprise here?] The ending has a shocking surprise that follows logically from the actions viewed previously.    There are morals to this story. Beware of the wealthy and their bad habits. Do not neglect your family so they get into trouble. The most important is to know when to cut your losses and avoid bad choices. Mildred should not have ripped up that $10,000 check, or gotten involved with sleazy Monte Beragon. [Does this story remind you of what you might see on the \\"Jerry Springer Show\\"?] Was this a sad story? Or a satire on human error?
0446677450|1.0|Ok, here's the deal.  While this book did have some interesting insights and tips, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  It seems to advocate being rather cut-throat to get what you want.  I guess if you don't mind walking on the poor and middle classes, then this is your way to wealth.  I get the whole point of not living in fear, but does that mean you must intimidate others?  I guess I'm one of those people who value honesty and decency over mounds of money.  Who wouldn't want to be rich?  But I'm not willing to sell my soul to get there.  So if that means I will live the rest of my days in the middle class, so be it.

I have to say that Stargate Atlantis is a wonderful show, darker and yet funnier than SG1 I guess the writers got to get better at their job while working on SG1 and the now 3 seasons of Atlantis.  If you watch the show, this is a most, and if you are just starting well now you have 60 episodes available to watch without having to wait.  Love all the characters can't wait for season 4 to begin!

0689853637|5.0|I am a fan of Robert Sabuda's wonderful pop up books. This is certainly a must have for his followers. The work in these books is amazing - hard to believe it's even possible to produce something so wondrous on a mass market level. I can't imagine not loving any of his books, and this is no exception.    Incidentally, I have given some of Sabuda's books to children as gifts, and they love them. However, I own most of them myself and when I've gifted adults with his books they are enchanted and delighted to receive such a marvelous gift. So don't think this is child only by any means!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I'm not sure why some people are saying the Director's Cut is not worth getting, or watching. I've watched both and I believe the Director's cut is superior. How can it not be if it is what the director wanted? Not only is the insertion of the songs the way they were originally intended important (and one of the things I love about Donnie Darko is its attention to details), you also have the title pages (from The Philosophy of Time Travel) displayed in the Directors Cut. In addition there are key lines (such as Donnie's therapist's telling him he is an agnostic) and visuals(particulary toward the end in the montage) that can totally change the perception of the film.     I picked up a copy of Clockwork Orange recently and was suprised to learn that Burgess's original text released everywhere else (besides the United States) had 21 chapters. In a brilliant intro to the re-released Clockwork Orange, Burgess states that each work created has a duration and a reason for its particular order and that editing it alters the perception of it (he states this edited version in the U.S. also effected Stanley Kubrick's retelling in the film version). In short,the story should be available the way the author,filmaker, or artist intended it to be told or you alter the meaning. In relation to Donnie Darko, placement and pacing are crucial to the interpretation of this film, to alter it is to alter what the director/writer was attempting to convey. Get the Director's Cut.

0143038419|3.0|I patiently suffered through Italy, as the author gorged on endless amounts of food. In India there was very little to inspire me, I expected more from her ashram experience.  Indonesia was the least cumbersome, and finally some semblance of a story and characters you could care about.  I read two other books while reading this one.  Those I couldn't put down...this one just dragged on endlessly...I only finished it because I couldnt bear just \\"donating\\" $15 to the publisher.
B000A6T262|4.0|The DVDs were without flaw (not always the case for Star Trek disks). As usual - The Voyage Home - & - First Contact - were the best. Paramount could have never made Insurrection and Nemesis and nothing would have been lost. The CGI in the last two are second to none but; the story line is wanting. If it were not for the last two movies I would have rated this collection 5 stars.
B00004XPPB|5.0|The depth of feeling, the subtlety of expression in the acting of Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, and Anne Heche--and many others--in this extraordinary film has no equal in any other film about organized crime that I know of. While other gangster films--even some of the best--seem to worship violence, romanticize thuggery, and idealize both good and evil, this one tells the story of real, complex people struggling with their real, complicated lives. The fact that those lives do not resemble ours very much at all makes the film fascinating, but not foreign or artificial in any way. It may be that Donnie Brasco is less well-known than it should be because it bursts the bounds of its genre.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This movie had it all.  It was an incredibly well written screenplay, amazing cinematography, great performances, awesome special effects and a powerful message.<br /><br />As a story about the \\"blood trade\\" of diamonds, this movie does a great job of bringing this issue to life for Westerners.  For many years, the West was content to ignore the reality of the diamond trade -- the circumstances of war torn Africa, the flow of Western money, enslavement of children barely out of single digits in age.  Fortunately this issue has gained worldwide attention and sparked both individual and government response in an attempt to stem the tide of this situation.  Hopefully individuals will see beyond the diamond issue this movie focuses on and familiarize themselves with other global situations similar to the the diamond trade that enable the consumerism of the West.<br /><br />Even if one is not concerned by the moral, social and political issues that this movie raises, it is equally powerful as a taut action thriller.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give performances that were well worthy of the Oscar nominations that they received.  The cinematography was some of the best that I have seen.  Often one thinks about this in terms of the sweeping vistas and gorgeous natural beauty.  However, the cinematography was equally impressive in the gritty urban scenes in Freetown and villages of Sierra Leone.<br /><br />This a movie not to be missed.
0385340559|2.0|Until now, I've sped through the Jack Reacher novels. Great characters, well-crafted, believable scenes and a very real toughness of attitude. Really exciting stuff.<br />But Bad Luck and Trouble is all of that and more...for the reader.<br />This is a clunky book. The members of Reacher's old unit come across as dull-witted and even a little wimpy. The pace is maddeningly slow. The love scene, if that's what you'd call it, seems too casual even for Reacher. And some of the action sequences just don't make sense. Reacher and crew infiltrate a high tech/high security company headquarters. Yet the grounds where most of that action takes place have no video surveillance, no motion detectors, no security lights and clueless, mannequin-like guards whose only function seems to be allowing Reacher to kill them. The \\"explosive finale\\" consists of Reacher (at 6-5 and 250 pounds) hiding in back of a relatively small helicopter (at least that's the impression Child offers)and appearing at a key moment to surprise the bad guys.<br />Reacher is at his best when he's on his own helping people, particularly women, in distress (Tripwire,Echo Burning, Die Trying, One Shot, Without Fail) or even getting himself out of a jam (Killing Floor,Pursuader). Giving him a team and sending him out to save the world only serves to diminish him.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Without a doubt, this is as good as film-making gets.  I had high expectations for this Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language film in 2006.  Needless to say, my expectations were thoroughly surpassed.<br /><br />The film focuses on mid-80s East Germany and the Stasi, the GDRs secret police.  Erich Honecker and the Stasi established one of the most repressive, totalitarianism societies on the planet.  We get a frightening view inside this world as we follow a mid-level Stasi office who has been ordered to spy on one of the leading East German playwrights and his actress girlfriend.<br /><br />The picture captures perfectly communist society, in this case East Germany, from the dull, dreary landscape to the dreadful architecture and communist paranoia.  Furthermore, the performances, both lead and supporting roles, are tremendous.  As someone who has studied quite a bit of Cold War history, this movie paints a picture perfect portrait of what life was like in a Soviet bloc country during this period of the 20th century<br /><br />This movie is as good as any American film from last year and is easily one of the best movies that I have seen this decade.  Go see this, filmaking doesn't get any better.
0316067598|5.0|Outstanding accounting of the patriotism that is in the heart of each of our service men and women and a detailed discription of what it takes to become a Navy Seal. Marcus Luttrell's accounting of this mission places you right next to him and his brothers in arms to capture or take out their al Qaeda target.   It is the type of book you canot put down once you start it.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Poll after poll in recent decades has shown healthcare (or to speak more precisely, the lack of affordable healthcare for all) to be the issue that more Americans feel strongly about than any other.  But special interest groups, i.e., the medical insurance providers and the American Medical Associations, as well as hundreds of fake grass roots groups that they have funded, have managed to undermine the good of the nation as a whole.<br /><br />This truly is a nonpartisan issue.  The film makes reference to the National Health Service in Great Britain, which is enormously popular with conservatives and liberals, doctors as well as patients.  One of the individuals Moore interviews mentions that Margaret Thatcher, a noted conservative, was a strong defender of the NHS.  He could also have mentioned that a key person guiding it through the legislative process was one of the most notable conservatives of the 20th century, Winston Churchill.  This is not a liberal-conservative issue, but a people issue.  Free, universal healthcare is an amazingly good thing for nations as wholes.<br /><br />Moore does a great job of highlighting the problems with a for-profit health system.  Despite the defenders of free market capitalism, there are several things it simply isn't any good at.  One of them is at providing universal programs for the commonweal.  In the United States for-profit healthcare has had the effect of empowering and benefiting financial services industries (insurance companies) at the expense of individuals.  As a result, Americans find healthcare, which already is not universally available, to be increasingly expensive and unaffordable.  And drug prices are spiraling out of control.<br /><br />As Moore shows in the film, almost all developed countries have better healthcare systems than the United States.  Most provide free and universal healthcare.  Many politicians, who accept huge campaign donations from various medical special interest groups, raise the specter of socialized medicine and spread myths about the unavailability of basic medical services.  Most of SICKO is devoted to taking on these \\"myths,\\" or, to use a better word, \\"lies.\\"  One of the most commonly told lies is that Canadians are trapped in a terrible health system in which they are often denied treatment for months.  Moore interviews a number of Canadians who clearly abhor the American health system and passionately embrace their own.  Moore asks one of these people whether he is a socialist, only to be told that he is a member of the Conservative Party.<br /><br />We are also often told (i.e., lied to) that things are terrible in Great Britain and France.  Once again, Moore visits both places and discovers that both the British and the French love their healthcare systems.  In all this I felt increasingly ashamed of the situation in the United States, not merely because of the expense and the lack of universality, but the approach.  We tend to treat conditions only after they have gotten bad, while the French and British emphasize preventative medicine.  In fact, one British doctor explained that he gets a bonus if he is able to get people to stop smoking.  In short, the healthcare systems in Canada, Great Britain, and France are exceedingly popular, while I rather hear anyone talk about how they love the American healthcare system.<br /><br />For the record, I work for a major insurer of hospitals and medical facilities.  I work inside the very industry that is causing a lot of the problems.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will help focus more concern on the need to gut and redo the American healthcare system.  Personally, I think the think to do is to make a revised Medicaid universal.  It should be revised to eliminate the Bush drug program for seniors (which is hated by the left, the right, and seniors) and put in place a real drug assistance program.  Why should the rest of the advanced countries have free, universal, and excellent healthcare while the United States suffer from inferior care?<br /><br />The only difficulty I had with the movie was the Cuba sequence.  Why?  Well, Moore had already made his point cogently and convincingly.  The trip to Cuba introduces a note of controversy that cloudies the water.  True, Cubans have free and excellent healthcare despite the poverty of the nation, but one thing that the film overlooks is that like in most countries there is considerable difference between the healthcare provided in the city and in the country.  Most of Cuba is rural and the healthcare there is not as good as what one finds in the city.  (Much the same is true in countries like China, where the quality of healthcare in the city is quite good while in the country is substandard.)  In other words, I thought the whole Cuba segment weakened the overall film.<br /><br />Hopefully Americans will get angry and do something about this.  Historically we don't wake up and change things until we let things go further than we should.  We tend to be a pretty compliant nation, willing to put up with a great deal before we get mad enough to do something about it.  Maybe the time is becoming ripe to get rid of the system we have and get something decent instead.The only difficulty I had with the movie was the Cuba sequence.  Why?

B000MRAAJW|5.0|Unbelievable footage from a distance and with low light, this is the most phenomenal documentary on far away and beautiful places that I have ever seen. Even IMAX has some work to do to match this on HD-DVD and big screen HDTV. It's well worth the investment. It's like being a world traveler without leaving home.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I came to this movie, \\"300\\", more as a student of Greek history and a lover of dramatic visual statements, and not a fan of graphic novels, or graphic comics. It doesn't really matter how you approach it. For me, the film \\"300\\" might be the most amazing theater experience I'll have this year. The release of the two-disc special DVD (there is also a single disc version), laden with special effects (including several short features about the history and the production itself) promises to bring a sell-out crowd despite the early list price of $34.99.<br /><br />Somewhat loosely based on the ancient battle between Greeks (yes, more city-states from Greece than just Sparta were involved) and the world-conquering forces of King Xerxes of Persia in 480 BC, the Battle of Thermopylae, is played out in the mind and art of Frank Miller, whose successful graphic novel spawned the film. Miller's had a lot of success, notably with \\"Sin City\\", and the films made from his books are faithful to the original material and feature over the top special effects, CGI, and an artist's eye to the total, sumptuous visual landscape.<br /><br />As Xerxes pulled out all the stops to conquer the world in the 5th century, it was troubling to him that his father, Persian King Darius, had been defeated in his efforts to move westward by the Athenians in the Battle of Marathon. Xerxes had put down rebellions in Babylon and Egypt, and made careful preparation to conquer Greece; he dug a channel, built bridges, laid in provisions and honed the warrior skills of a force purported to be 50,000-70,000 (the million man army in the film). He bribed and won over several of the Greek city states to his cause. His messengers set out to do the same with the King of Sparta, Leonidas (Gerard Butler, a Scot who was Wes Craven's \\"Dracula\\", the incredibly sexy Andre Marek of \\"Timeline\\", and the film Phantom for Andrew Lloyd Webber).<br /><br />\\"300\\" begins at the childhood of Leonidas, to set the stage for the warrior mentality of the Spartans. The early scenes depict how the Spartans might kill any baby who had any type of weakness or deformity at birth. Based on the decisions of the Elders, the \\"weak\\" were left to die at the ravages of the environment on Mount Taygetos. It shows how, at the age of 7, the boys are taken from their homes and raised in packs, taught to be warriors with savagery and brutality inflicted on their spirits.<br /><br />When the Persians come calling, Leonidas defies them, against the advice of the local Oracle, and the Greek council, who forbid him to go to war. Leonidas, counseled by his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey..from \\"The Brothers Grimm\\"..here she is a queen to be reckoned with)sets off with a \\"bodyguard\\" of 300 men to deflect the Persian attack. It is a doomed effort, but one in which the Persian army is severely shamed and its forces reduced by thousands of dead.<br /><br />In the end, a Greek traitor shares a secret passage with the Persians, that allows the small force of Spartans to be defeated, even as Queen Gorgo is pleading with the city council (controlled by the evil Theron ...Dominic West) to release more forces. It is inconceivable that the Greeks waited to come to the aid of a King who was fighting for the very freedom that was held so dear by all Greeks.<br /><br />There are crucial characterizations here, between King and Queen, whose bond and caring for their own small son, is made secondary to their pride in being Spartans. You will believe in them. There are love scenes (and some gratuitous female nudity early on in the film) that help advance that feeling between them.<br /><br />There is the relationship between Leonidas and his men, the pride, the harsh training evident in their ability to act as one in battle. (And yes, there is the most amazing display of male 6-pack abs ever displayed on film). There is the grittiness in the feel and the dirt of the life of a soldier. There is the evil that seeps from the lavish worldof King Xerxes (whose character was absent from the early advertising and trailers of this film, resulting in a huge surprise when he first appears on the screen); he gives new meaning to the term larger-than life. Xerxes is played by Rodrigo Santoro, also appearing on the small screen as Paulo in \\"Lost\\".<br /><br />There is the raw use of CGI in depicting the creatures and zombies used in the fighting forces of Xerxes, as well as in the hunchbacked traitor Ephialtes. This is pretty typical for the graphic novel culture, and it will be one of the largest areas of criticism of the film. For me, these special effects and unrealistic creatures contributed to the battles in the same way they did in the Lord of the Rings series.<br /><br />And really, its all about the battle. The manner in which \\"300\\" is filmed is somewhat like that of a video game....you, the watcher, are transported to the battle. Its sounds, horrors and the ravages of countless death upon death surround you. Blood spatters everywhere. The Spartans are fighting machines, coupling their efforts with a terrain, strategy and technique that Leonidas sketched out with the Oracle, enacted in his battle with the wolf, and brought to life with his forces as they defeat wave after wave of bloodthirsty soldiers that Xerxes sends against them. His Captain, (Welsh actor Vincent Regan) is engaged both in battle and in pride for his young son, who fights by his side - the Captain's anguish at the loss of his son is real and tragic. Wounding by both sword and spear is depicted, as is decapitation and the terror of the victor cleaning up the field of battle by killing the wounded. The hordes of the Persian army are of epic proportion.<br /><br />The battle scenes, yes, the entire film is stylistically colored in sepia and earth tones, and the violence fills up every frame. The cinematography here, and even in the quiet parts of the film, is amazing.<br />The \\"300\\" is one man's vision of a historical event, magnified by today's technology, and assembled for the screen to depict how important it is to fight for freedom, even if you do so at the cost of your own life. It has been said to be a \\"man's film\\" but that is true only if you discount the underlying philosophy and bravery of what it takes to stand for something, and how even the love between two people, between a group of men fighting for a just cause may temporarily be defeated, but ultimately vindicated when lives are lost to sacrifice for the greater good.<br /><br />And I can't wait to buy the DVD!!!om the early advertising and trailers of this film, resulting in a huge surprise when he first appears on the screen); he gives new meaning to the term larger-than life.

B000T46O8O|5.0|With a cast like this, who cares about the story? Fortunately, the story also works well enough to keep us more than interested. \\"Harold\\" hears the author of his own story in his head. We follow him on his quest to find the source of the voice. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the tortured writer who feels she has killed her characters and ergo, guilty of murder. Very quirky and full of surprises, I found Stanger than Fiction a real gem. Will Ferrell is brilliant as well. Great DVD to pick up when you're not quite sure what to see but wish for something surprising.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this CD.  I am a longtime fan of Bon Jovi.  This CD proves that Bon Jovi can adapt to the changing times of music.  I can listen to this CD with my children (ages 10-15) and they love it too!  It's a \\"feel good\\", \\"let's rock\\", and \\"take it easy\\" collection that I never get tired of listening to!
0440241030|3.0|I like the Reacher books, even though they are preposterous.  Reacher, of course, is a caricature of the loner super-hero and this book is no exception.  Sometimes I think the name \\"Reacher\\" is literal -- in other words, the author may be reaching a bit too far in his plot turns.  BUT...on the whole, this was a good Reacher novel, if you can just suspend belief and reality for a few hundred pages.  It's a good yarn, with a lot of suspense and some pretty well-drawn characters.  I think the writing here is a shade better than in Child's other Reacher books and the plot is creative.  If you're a Reacher fan, you'll like this one.  I am and I did.
B000055Y0X|4.0|I was looking for another dvd when I found this one again. I saw this film as a kid and it was funny. I am always picking up old movies for my library so I said why not get it. I am so glad I did because world events over the years have made this film hilarious. I am not a critic, just a regular guy, but I recommend this film for most age groups.
B00005JPAO|1.0|If the DVD sold here is like the DVDs sold elsewhere, there is some clever trick done to prevent the purchaser from backing up the DVD using some of the existing DVD ripping software that is out there. I suspect they intentionally degrade the quality of the disc such that it cannot be read bit-by-bit by ripping software. You probably don't care about backing up the DVD, given the questionable legality of it, but the problem is that the way they do this renders the DVD unplayable on many players. It would not play on mine, and I thought my player was broken, and went out and bought another. Had I searched on the net first, I would've found out about this sorry piece of anti-consumer engineering and saved myself a lot of trouble.<br /><br />So, I hope you'll reconsider your purchase both in protest of this practice, and because there's a fair chance the movie won't play for you. At the very least, if you do buy it and it doesn't work in your player, now you'll understand why.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|What a dissapointment this movie was.  Dysfunctional could have been interesting, but wasn't.  It could have been funny, but wasn't.  Glad I watched this for free.
1416911049|5.0|I have been reading Amazon reviews for years now--using them to help determine whether I would purchase a book or not, but I have never actually written one, despite times where I thought I would. I have, however, finally decided to write one of my own, all because of this book.    Scott Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" series is one of the best books I have ever read. The entire time I was reading it, I kept pausing, staring at my wall, and thinking to myself, \\"Wow, I wish I could write that well.\\" I was completely caught up in the imagery of his words--I could actually see things taking place as he wrote them. The man is a master of his craft. He can manipulate words and string them together in an incredible, enviable way.    As his world is set in the future, he uses words without explaining them, but it is not hard to pick up through context clues what they mean. This is especially apparent in the second and third books, though by the end of the second book, I was thinking to myself that things were quite \\"bubbly\\" and that I had definitely gone \\"mind-missing\\" when I couldn't find my keys. In the second book, after the transformation, he uses words as though Tally truly has undergone the surgery, apparent in her speech and her thoughts and choice of words. It only furthers my point at what a genius Mr. Westerfeld is, and how good he is at setting his scene.    Though the concepts in the book are not new, Mr. Westerfeld never acts as though they are. The basic story is this: all people at the age of sixteen undergo surgery to become pretty. However, in the first book it is discovered that the surgery doesn't just make you pretty--it does something to your mind, too, to control you and keep everyone nice and happy. That's how the world ends war. But some of the people decide they want to think for themselves, and thus begins quite the problem for this perfect society that has been created...    I read all three books in less than a day, though it tended to drag a little abouta quarter of the way through the third book. Tally had gone through so many changes that I was tired of her changing, and she had chosen Zane and I had picked David, and the books are quite long and I think my eyes were tired from the low-light I was using to read. Still, I recommend reading all three books, buying all three books, and then buying another set to give to a friend. But feel free to change-up the order.
B000MTOKYG|5.0|This seamless blend of African pop and American folk styles is one of the most exquisite musical achievements of the 20th century. The melodies are divine, the vocals inspired, and each and every one of the compositions is a masterpiece. There is sadness and joy in the music, but above all it is a celebration of life.<br /><br />The best loved songs include The Boy In The Bubble, Graceland, Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes and Under African Skies, but the rest hold great charm too. The most rootsy African sounds surface on I Know What I Know with the robust and soulful vocal infusions of The Gaza Sisters.<br /><br />Paul Simon has always successfully integrated exotic sounds in his music to create great beauty: Andean flutes on El Condor Pasa, Caribbean rhythms on Me And Julio Down By The School Yard and Mother & Child Reunion, and Latin/South American sounds on [[ASIN:B0002EQ7EC The Rhythm of the Saints]], but Graceland is his towering achievement as a solo artist, a truly exceptional album with a power and beauty that transcends all musical boundaries.
B00005JODM|3.0|More music,more dancing,more stars,but a lot less laughs is the only way I can think to truly access the new \\"Hairspray\\" from Adam Shankman. My toes never stopped feeling the beat.But I honestly have to agree with others that despite the flashiness and glitz of the screen production, all that was politically charged and so uniquely weird about John Waters movie and even the Musical on Broadway was missing.Two of the best numbers from the live show were cut.\\"Mama,I'm a Big Girl Now\\" which was the defining number between Tracy and Edna and with the omission of the classic jail scene, \\"The Big Doll house\\",which was another great number about ladies sizes is gone.Apart from all that,simply put, all of the great John Waters humour is missing.Like I said,lots of music, lots of dancing,but for me all that made the other \\"Hairsprays\\" hits was really lacking.It was okay, but I will stick with the John Waters film and drop back over to Broadway for a better time! At least \\"Hairspray\\" fares better than \\"The Producers\\".
B0002J54K0|5.0|This 1979 album opens with the lilting ballad Changing Of The Guards. The female backing vocals lend a soulful tone to the music here and throughout the album. This R&B feel is what sets Street Legal apart from Dylan's more familiar spectrum of styles.<br /><br />New Pony has an even more authentic R&B air about it, whilst the beautifully tuneful No Time To Think is more in his folk-rock vein, but still embellished by the soulful backing voices. It is my favourite and a definite highlight of the album.<br /><br />Baby Stop Crying is a rock ballad with tempo variation and stirring organ, Is Your Love In Vain? is a tender love ballad with a melancholy undertone and Senor is a slow, meandering folk number. The next track sounds the most like early Dylan with those characteristic vocal inflections; True Love Tends To Forget is a mournful lament with an impressive arrangement.<br /><br />The theme remains mistrust and lost love, but We Better Talk This Over is a very catchy pop song with a hypnotic appeal. The album concludes with a tour de force: Where Are You Tonight?, a flowing uptempo ballad with gripping imagery and an exquisite arrangement.<br /><br />This album is way underrated in Dylan's body of work. There is no weak track and there are many memorable songs like the aforementioned No Time To Think, Is Your Love In Vain?, True Love Tends To Forget and the final track.<br /><br />Some Dylan fans and critics might have been prejudiced against the R&B sound but it most certainly works. Street Legal has definitely improved with age and I consider it to be amongst Dylan's Top 10 albums.

It gives you very good tips to find your way around the fretboard, and deserves its name of workbook: it is like a crossword book! Full of exercices, you feel like you're playing a game! However, if you're looking for a theory book, that's not it. The advices at the end of the book to make you keep on going mastering the fretboard are very interesting, it is overall a very good tool, a good a start or, for people like me, another reason to say to yourself \\"why didn't I figure this out before\\"!
0743298020|1.0|This book was VERY poor.  The opening 8 pages (available to read on Amazon) are atrocious and I almost stopped reading the book there and then.  The characters are not well defined, the writing is sloppy and amateurish.  The plot makes no sense as a 'mystery' and the surprise is falsely manufactured, not to mention improbably stupid.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|Wow, here's possibly the worst Bond movie ever made and it's a huge hit....something is really wrong here.    On the plus side - \\"the new guy\\" carries himself well and moves well in the action scenes. In fact he even carries a bad script relatively well. And the first 15 minutes or so have some amazing action, with fluid movement and breath-taking stunts, making it easily the best part of the movie. So I can readily accept him in the role of everyone's favorite spy.    BUT- the movie is inconsistent (especially as far as the other films go), has about 6 major plot holes, is ENTIRELY predictable and to be blunt, it just doesn't have the refinement of the others in the franchise. I know this is supposed to be a \\"reimagining\\" or what have you, but here's the problem - there are more Bond movies than any other character in history, so clearly the series wasn't really suffering so badly that it needed revamping in the first place. In the second, one of the things that always made Bond interesting was that he is a distinguished ladies man, a gentleman spy if you will. Here he is written like every other run of the mill spy on celluloid. For a minute I thought I watching one of the Bourne movies. There are no gadgets, no Q, no sly witticisms (at least none that really work) and Bond has none of the qualities that make him the classic character he is. Here he becomes a clone of the latest successful actioners, and despite the weak \\"prequel\\" premise, he is simply not remotely related to James Bond. My wife and I were bored silly. On top of that, IF this is supposed to be happening prior to any of the other movies, then the timelines, technologies and characters are so inconsistent that the whole thing falls apart. I for one am tired of movie makers trying to reinvent the wheel with the most succesful franchises in the industry and destroying my favorite characters in the process. If they want to redo a movie then let them take something completely and utterly insipid like Boogey Man and reinvent that.     Call me a purist if you want to, but frankly when something works - don't fix it ya know? I think we need to hold movie makers up to higher standards because otherwise they will keep rehashing good movies and continue to fail at coming up with anything original, so I don't think having higher standards is a bad thing. Whatever. Regardless, when watched with an objective eye, this movie fails in every way that counts. If this were a new character, I may have enjoyed it more. But when you try and add your efforts to a legacy like this one, you'd better be able to deliver more than this predictable and obvious tripe. Not the worst movie ever, but a very sad addition to the Bond series.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|I'm a new fan of The National but the strength of this album has convinced me to get their back catalog.  Having just heard snippets of different songs I was unprepared for how much stronger their songs are in the context of the whole album.  The first time I popped the album in I was taken back by the deep baritone of Matt Berninger's voice coming through my speakers.  Ten seconds later the deep hypnotic drawl of his voice had grabbed me and dragged me deep into the National's sonic landscape.  \\"Fake Empire\\" starts out catchy and strong and while the drums initially sound as if the drummer is pounding away to the wrong song, it quickly coalesces into one of the best tracks on the album.  Another early favorite is the quiet, beautiful \\"Start a War\\" with one of my favorite chord progressions of all time.  Overall the whole album is a somewhat subdued affair although the phenomenal drumming of Bryan Devendorf drives the music forward with intensity and urgency.  Easily a pick for one of the top 10 best of 2007.
B00005JPAO|5.0|A five star acting job for Helen Mirren.  Sometimes the award shows get it right.Given that no one knows anything about the Queen that she doesn't share, Mirren is dead on in her portrayal. Every member of the cast in fact is right on in presenting their characters.  I've watched it a couple times and it really holds up.
B000N66L5Y|4.0|As some one who is not naturally interested in supernatural/fantasy/horror film, I am captivated by this tv series.  This show is one of a couple good shows from the CW.  One aspect of this show I like is that it typically takes place in small towns in middle america, which is a nice respite from the myriad of drama shows in manhattan.  Additionally it relies on quality acting from the two main actors (who perform about 90% of the show's acting), and also from some of the reacurring actors and even the one timers.  Many of the episodes can be enjoyed without following the entire series, but following the series in order offers more enjoyment, as it often refers back to occurences in previous shows.  The second season has developed a stronger sense of plot line than did the first season, which was easier to follow without seing the entire season.  The second season is slightly edgier than the first season with slightly more mature references and situations, although the show is by no means inappropriate for some younger viewers (this is of course up to the parent's inclination).  Like other CW shows, this is a writing heavy show which relies on a mix of witty cultural references, family tensions and fast moving dialogue.  If you are completely turned off by supernatural/fantasy programing the campiness of this show might not be your thing, but if you can get past this (or if you like it) you will appreciate the acting, origionality and writing of this show.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|A great movie with a fabulous cast, director and script.  Violent for sure and not a good show for young kids, but for those who like to be scared alittle and into a place of constantly guessing the outcome, this is for you.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|No words can describe the beauty of the images shown in these movies. The soft voice and the enthusiasm of David Attenborough for commenting the differents scenes makes this Series one of the best ever about Nature.
B00005YU1O|4.0|If you enjoy hearing folks wax philosophical and don't mind spacey visuals, you may enjoy this film. Here is a sample from Robert Solomon:    \\"The reason why I refuse to take existentialism as just another French fashion or historical curiosity is that I think it has something very important to offer us for the new century. I'm afraid we're losing the real virtues of living life passionately, in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are, the ability to make something of yourself, and feeling good about life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it's a philosophy of despair. But I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre, once interviewed, said he never really felt a day of despair in his life. But one thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance, of feeling on top of it. Its like: your life is yours to create.    \\"I've read the postmodernists with some interest, even admiration. But when I read them I always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out. The more that you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as fragmented or marginalized, what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre talks about responsibility he's not talking about something abstract. He's not talking about the kind of self or soul that theologians would argue about. It's something very concrete. It's you and me talking, making decisions, doing things, and taking the consequences.    \\"It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting, nevertheless, what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference first of all in material terms. It makes a difference to other people. And it sets an example. And in short I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off and see ourselves as the victim of various forces. It's always _our_ decision who we are.\\"
1932907009|4.0|I can't say this is a poor book. It isn't. But I can't say it's an excellent book, either. I prefer to put in the \\"Fundamentals\\" category. Like Syd Field's or David Trottier's.    Basically, it'll give you some tools to finally START writing, avoiding from the beginning common mistakes. It'll give you some examples of what you shouldn't write, explaining why It won't work and didn't work in similar scripts. It provides also useful \\"laws\\" (some seam more real than others) which every script should follow (and no doubt some of them you really SHOULD follow), specially beginners but I'm sure there are other ways of writing scritps (reading \\"Save the Cat\\" may get you thinking that there aren't), and, to Mr. Snider's horror, a lot of movies out there that simply didn't follow them and were still... smash hits.      The part I don't understand is why Mr. Snider picks so much in movies like \\"Signs\\" (there're a lot of worse movies which, contrary to \\"Signs\\" were, indeed, a failure) and insists so much in giving movies like \\"Aladin\\" as an example of success. Ok, it was, but really, I don't see \\"Aladin\\" as why I got into screenwriting, if you know what I mean.     Summing up, it's a good book for those who don't know where to begin; also gives good advice for those who want to sell their scripts (Snyder insists a lot in the \\"scripts = business\\" part). But it isn't, definitely and fortunately, the \\"last book you'll ever need on screenwriting\\".  Sorry for the rubbish english, as I am Portuguese...
0385340559|4.0|I *finally* got to the top of the hold list for the latest Lee Child novel, Bad Luck and Trouble.  While I enjoyed the further adventures of Jack Reacher, this one didn't quite grab me as much as the earlier ones...<br /><br />As usual, Reacher is drifting from place to place, carrying nothing more than his passport and a toothbrush.  When he goes to an ATM to get some cash, he notices that the balance is $1030 higher than it should be.  Reacher deduces that it's not a fluke, and that it is really a request for assistance, a 10-30 in police call code.  He tracks the deposit down to a former special investigator team member, and thus starts on a mission that reunites him with his former colleagues.  But not all of the team is represented, as four of the original eight have been murdered and/or are missing.  As the team reassembles, others are waiting and watching the group, for reasons not clear in the beginning.  As the fates of the missing team members are discovered, Reacher has to figure out what they might have known that cost them their lives.  All they have to go on are seven pages of a spreadsheet with seemingly random ratios.  When they actually *do* figure out the meaning of the numbers, avenging the deaths of their friends becomes secondary to what really needs to be done.<br /><br />This installment of the Reacher story has more background and color about Jack than any other previous novel.  From that standpoint, it was great to learn a bit more about what drives and motivates him to live the lifestyle he does.  I think the initial \\"gathering of the team\\" took a bit longer than I expected, and as such the story seemed to stall out a bit early on.  Once they connected the dots and figured out what was up, then I was hooked and had to finish it up before I did anything else.  But I didn't have the normal \\"must keep reading\\" feeling from page 1.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still a good novel, and Reacher fans will enjoy it.  And it's good to know that Child is already hard at work on the next one...on the next one...

B00004TWZF|2.0|Based on the positive reviews I read for this movie, I sent for it.  Mistake, unless it's been raining for ten days and you've read all the books on your nightstand. This movie is pretentious and silly and has long dull stretches.<br /><br />Essentially it has two story lines. First is the friendly diving rivalry which begins when the protagonist, Jacques, and his lifetime rival, Enzo, grow up together in the same Greek village where Jacques' father is a professional diver.  The movie chronicles the on-going rivalry between Enzo, who is older, prouder, more flamboyant, more verbal, and more sophisticated than Jacques, who is borderline socially retarded and embarrassingly (and unbelievably) naive for someone his age.  Jacques' primary relationships are with dolphins.  He understands them; they understand him.  This is a simple unit: he deep sea dives; he swims with dolphins.  End of story.<br /><br />Enter the second storyline, a subplot involving a perky girl named Johanna, an insurance claim adjuster from NYC(of all places!)sent to South America to investigate a truck full of expensive equipment which fell into a crevasse where it remains submerged under glacial water until Spring.  As it turns out, Jacques has been hired to dive in the glacial water, and we learn that he possesses enormous lung capacity coupled with the ability to slow his heartbeat and send his blood to his brain, just like whales and dolphins.<br /><br />Johana takes one look at this handsome hunk of few words and she's gobsmacked.  She returns to NYC and mopes until she seizes on a scheme to defraud her insurance company into paying for her trip to Teramina, Sicily, to watch the deep sea diving competition between Enzo and Jacques and a host of international diving wannabes.  Inexplicably the socially savvy Johanna, played by Rosanna Arquette, becomes a besotted groupie for the unsophisticated Jacques, played by Jean Mark Barr. For my money, this movie is stolen by the heavy-lidded, cockatoo-beaked French actor, Jean Reno, who is a man so conventionally unattractive he's appealing by virtue of his magnetic Gallic presence alone.<br /><br />The best scenes in the movie are those involving the diving itself, and Jacques' scenes swimming with his dolphins.  Alas, the rest of the movie is tripe.  The ending is ludicrous.

Because of the reaction to the popularity of the first series and the changing of the end i feel there was more of a contrivance to please in the second and third series. the second with it's removal of 'charles' as king and the ascension of 'william' to the throne has a familiar ring to it. In the 3rd series the EOKA Cyprus affair,most who watch would hardly remember the actual history but could compare it with events today. The criticism of British troop behavior in public in Cyprus was correct. I have witnessed first hand that same 'behavior'.   The series reminded me of a dramatic rendering to compare with ANTONY JAY's 'YES MINISTER' AND 'YES PRIME MINISTER' comedic attempts at the same sort of stuff, telling tales out of school. After all Jay was another 'in the know' as the British Prime Minister's son-in-law and Ambassador to DC

B000002UB3|5.0|this is the greatest rock album on the planet and of all time as far as i am concerned... It is bursting with mind boggling originality, brilliance in composition, singing, and musicianship. Both sides offer tremendous rock songs, from John's always fresh and brilliant 'Come together', to beautiful ballads like 'Something', to pure childlike pleasure of 'Octopuss's garden' and 'Maxwell's silver hammer'(somewhat silly, but so well-sung and playful!) to the unbelievably effective 'I want you(she's so heavy)' which ushers in the hard rock era with more gravity than any song had ever done before...'Maxwell's silver hammer' is a comedy-horror-pop song really, a new term(self-coined) that describes it better since Maxwells' silver hammer does come down on someone's head in the song!! Side B is full of awesome songs, the eversunny and phenomenal 'Here comes the sun', a Harrison masterpiece essentially, followed by the near-monastic and philosophical vocal jewel 'Because', with magnificent vocal harmonies by John, Paul, and George(just listen to it!!), and the long medley of brilliant short songs, and controlled rock improvisations of great beauty, power and subtlety, all at the same time. 'You never give me your money and the rest of that song with the enigmatically enchanting guitar riffs by George, and John (presumably) till it fades away to 'Sunking' is one of their most original and greatest musical excursions... A brilliant and multifaceted Lennon-McCartney/Beatles composition. It ends with the four chorusing: \\" one two three four five six seven, all the children go to heaven\\"... truly mindboggling in its power and beauty, and deeply engaging rock... they are all instrumental virtuosos here, make no mistake about it!!! (Ringo's drumming is at its pinnacle on this classic album.) Abbey road shines with a maturity that goes beyond the ordinary test of time... Decades later it can still surpass all new albums that come out and create waves of recognition...What's the weakness of Abbey road? McCartney's 'Oh! darling' and/or 'Maxwell's silver hammer(though both somehow fitted in so well!!) probably if any...'Oh darling' is an enchanting piece nevertheless with very UnMcCartniyish vocal presentation and appears to be an attempt to rise above Lennon's hardrock tour-de-force 'i want you(she's so heavy)'... but it is neatly sandwiched between maxwell's silver hammer, and octopuss's garden before the side a mindstopper 'i want you'. it really fits in with more poppy and agitated vocal type all at the same time in a strange and wondrous fit indeed!! The medley of songs on side b are the best concocted rock lineage that exists...What a fantastic gift to the world before the band dissolved!!!!...

B000H0MKOC|3.0|Here's a good example of how smart, literary satire doesn't translate well onto the screen.  Thank You For Smoking does have some big laughs, but it just doesn't hang together as a movie.  The titles are extremely good - and it does contain one high concept joke - no one is actually ever seen smoking a cigarette throughout the entire picture.  But film is a \\"show me don't tell me\\" medium, and Nick's tiresome monologues, required to set up point of view and plot turns, show the fingerprints of a director with young and heavy hands.<br /><br />What this film does get right is the pitch; cynicism is rampant and shows up consistently, there are no heroes.  Robe Lowe is perfectly cast as the completely soul-less super-agent, and the brief moments his assistant spends on screen are memorable.  The reliable Sam Elliott is note perfect - his moral outrage quivers visibly with the proximity of cash.  Robert Duvall, who by now could mail in a performance like this, is very comfortable as the \\"Captain\\" - tobacco industry ruler - and even seems to exhibit some remorse at the idea of killing his grand-daughter.  J.K. Simmons - a consistently excellent actor - is outstanding as BR, our protagonist's ruthless boss who pretty much epitomizes opportunism.  Katie Holmes as Heather Holloway is enchanting as she steals our hope that the fourth estate might be on a morally higher plane than everyone else in the miasma.<br /><br />The kidnapping episode, the book's lynch pin, is used, but abused, it seems to drop out of the air then conveniently disappear.  But that's not the film's overriding problem.  Aaron Eckhart as Nick is winning, but completely uninteresting.  Any engaging substance this film might have generated would have come from Nick's personality, and inner struggle with the facile way he bends truth.  Since we never see anything remotely resembling a personality, we can't like him or dislike him, we just look at him as a hideous reflection of what we've become, a symbol of the manipulative and disingenuous forces surrounding us.  For Nick, and for everyone here, truth isn't even an issue anymore; the issue is, what is sell-able?  It's an accurate social observation that would have made a good essay, did make a good book, and didn't make a good movie.and disingenuous forces surrounding us.

The acting is top-notch, and I do believe that this is defintely John Goodman's finest performance. The movie will leave you feeling warm at heart over and over again. The soundtrack for the movie is also of high quality and most of it is integrated into the movie at the right time. A few people have been giving negative reviews on here about this film, and I can just say that I don't agree. On the contrary, what more could you want from a film that doesnt try to be too much, and is mainly just a down to earth story about a small-town girl trying to make something of her life in a big city. There is nothing in the movie that has a WOW factor to it, but that doesnt retract anything from the story to me. If you haven't seen it, you could do a lot LOT worse than to buy this movie.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|We just saw David's INLAND EMPIRE last night at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica where it was playing for a four-night limited engagement. As much as I look forward to the DVD, I'm so glad to have caught this on the big screen. The visuals are often so dark and moody that it demands a large screen. This movie is not typical Lynch fare. Rather, it is Lynch outdoing Lynch. The story is surreal and experimental. You can try to follow it but a lot of what you see will be left to interpretation. Do not look for a simple connect-the-dots story because it's not there. However, I highly recommend this film because of its abstractionist qualities, the acting, and the cinematography. It is beautifully filmed. Well, perhaps \\"beautifully\\" isn't the right adjective; it's hauntingly captivating. Mainstream and even so called \\"cutting edge\\" directors would do well to study this film. Lynch can take any scene and make it creepy in a way 99.9% of Hollywood directors simply cannot do. He is magical in this regard. As a graphic artist, INLAND EMPIRE was, to me, a three-hour art lesson. I walked away from this film and felt re-energized, as if I'd just been given a \\"how-to\\" instruction manual on the unsettling. Lynch uses both black and white and color throughout this picture and he does so seemlessly. Laura Dern should have gotten an Oscar nod for her performance; it is her finest work to date and you will be blown away by her range. There is not a bad performance in this film. It is, of course, not going to appeal to fans of mainstream studio Hollywood, but would you really want it to? See this movie on the big screen if it comes to your neighborhood; prepare to be creeped out. With Hollywood circling the drain for ideas, we need David Lynch more now than ever before.
0586091718|4.0|A concisely written, understandable account of the quantum theories of David Bohm, essentially that the old diddy, life is but a dream is absolutely true.  Still, most of what he says is based on faith, and the book certainly bogs down as the author's exciting scientific account delves into parapsychology at which point it becomes hard to take serious.  Overall, though, this lapse into maudlin supposition does not entirely detract from the clear way Mr. Talbot brings into expression the nature of the implicate order and its effect on reality.

0316067598|5.0|The book had quite a bit of military jargon that a layman didn't understand. (maybe a military glossary in the back) Other than that a very touching story.  I was impressed.
1596912855|1.0|I finished the book in a day and it is an easy read. I would say the best two things about this book are the dedication and ease of reading.     The premise of the novel is that the main character, Jane, an over 30 single NY female, is obsessed with Pride & Prejudice - and Mark Darcy, of course. Then her rich great aunt learns of the obsession and decides, in her will, to send Jane to a kind of Austen \\"camp\\" for adults in England to \\"cure\\" her of the obsession. At Austen camp, Jane has to dress like a nineteenth century female and observe proper antiquated etiquette rules. Other guests - only women it seems - pay handsomely for this privilege as well. The guests themselves kind of assume various facets of Austen characters. The Austen camp is staffed with actors who fill-in withany missing Austen roles, including the rich uncle, the bored and arrogant Mr. Darcy, and the dashing young captain. Honestly, the main function of the camp staffers seems to be flirting with and kissing (the book suggests that some of the repeat customers come to expect more than kissing) the women who come to Austen camp. Austen camp is run by one character - I like to think of her as the Austen madam - who apparently \\"assigns\\" the Austen staffers to various Austen campers for flirting, etc. After about 100 pages, all I could think was \\"Jane's aunt has sent her to the Austen brothel!\\" And that was what I thought at the end of the book too. Jane herself struggles the whole book trying to figure out which Austen camp staffers are telling her \\"real\\" things or are just flirting with her and kissing her because they are paid to do so. Halfway through the book, Jane curiously decides that the only way to really get into the experience is to suspend disbelief and for whatever reason, she finds herself believing in the reality of Austenland. I found the whole thing kind of stomach turning. The worst was when one of the other Austen campers wasn't getting enough attention from the Austen actors andshe complained to the Austen madam. (It's something along the lines of \\"I've paid a lot of money for this and am expecting a romance in return.\\") Jane then observes an Austen camp staffer making romantic declarations to and then canoodling and other things with the complaining Austen camper. The weird thing is, toward the end, the author herself seems to be concerned that Austen camp might be a whorehouse because she makes the Austen madam claim that they aren't running a brothel. But it is really hard to think otherwise!     The other main theme is that Jane hasn't found a nice man because she wants everyone to live up to Mark Darcy standards. The book, however, reveals the complete opposite. Through a rather long-lived set of flashbacks, the reader learns that Jane has gone out with every rogue, lame headed, vapid or mean man she has met. Her problem wasn't that her standards were too high - they were far far too low. Curing herself of Mark Darcy hopes seems like a ridiculous way to solve her relationship woes.     By the end of the book, I despised the main character and pretty much everyone else in the book. It's rare that I have such a strong reaction to a book, but this one is a loser. I liked Hale's Goose Girl. I think maybe the whole Austenland camp idea just doesn't have many places to go.

0634049011|5.0|I'm a \\"middle aged\\" student that has been playing cowboy chords for years, but never got much beyond first position.  I've wanted to learn scales, arps, triads and other techniques to bring out more expression and to be able to solo anywhere on the neck with confidence.  I started and stopped several other guitar courses because at some point the author made leaps or assumptions I simply wasn't ready for.  This is by far the most logically designed and naturally progressing course I've seen for learning the fretboard.  It's very well written and very clear in communicating the unique structure of the guitar.  I would strongly recommend this to any beginning or intermediate student--or even those who have been playing awhile--but want to go back to basics and relearn it the way it should be learned.  There's a lot of material here, so don't expect to complete it in anything short of many months to a year.  I'm about six weeks into it and have already learned basics about root and chord positions, scales and theory that other courses--and several teachers--have not been able to make clear to me.  I don't know if it's a function of age, limited practice time or sensory overload from job and household duties, but retaining a lot of abstract information does not come as easy as it used to.  But using the author's methodical way of learning this material, it gets dialed in pretty quickly and it stays there!  Highly recommended!

B000QUCNOK|3.0|A meritorious overall design and an intriguing beginning are promptly buried by exceptionally unconventional twists and a laughably bizarre conclusion in Tom Tykwer's Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. With undertones of Silence of the Lambs, and a beautifully haunting score, we're unfortunately forced to root for Buffalo Bill. Based on the perceivably unfilmable bestselling novel by Patrick Suskind, the world of scents and smell appear visually delightful; however it fails to be wholly entertaining.<br /><br />In 18th century France, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born to a nauseating fishmonger who promptly disposes of him in a pile of rotting fish carcasses and writhing maggots. She earns the noose for her troubles, and Grenouille is sent to grow up in the orphanage where he discovers his astounding ability to discern every kind of smell. He is sold to a vile tanner, and during a fortunate delivery happens upon Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a d&eacute;class&eacute; perfumer who quickly buys Grenouille when he discovers his skills for deciphering the ingredients used in a rival's perfume. When a chance encounter with a young girl leads him to obsess over the unobtainable scent of womanhood, he ignites a killing spree of several women in the city of Grasse, using their bodies to create the elusive aroma. Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) must protect his daughter, the most enticing woman in Grasse, whom he knows might be the final ingredient in Grenouille's relentless and unimaginable plan.<br /><br />Newcomer Ben Wishaw plays Grenouille with morbid yet enticing fervor, leading the viewer to anxiously wait for his next psychotic endeavor. Hoffman and Rickman also lend their acting expertise; Hoffman mainly for comic relief, and Rickman for much needed, stern normalcy. And normalcy is what Perfume so desperately lacked, as the twisted events abruptly spiraled to an unfathomable conclusion. So many pieces worked in favor of the film, but nothing could save it from its intangible plot. We follow the works of Grenouille much in the same way we root for the insidious Hannibal Lector, except that Perfume is unquestionably devoid of any Clarice Starling characters to which we can justifiably relate. As much as the film is visually stunning, the eccentricity is so overwhelming that by the unpredictable and sadly laughable conclusion, we're left with nothing to dwell on but those very atrocities. Culminating with a surprising display of sexual deviance, the magnificence and allure of the characters and settings are disbanded, resulting in disbelief and confusion. Crossing those boundaries of believability, even in a predominantly fantasy environment, and then subjecting audiences to little sense of retribution, leaves much to be desired from such an engrossing start. Curiously reminiscent of David Lynch, Shinya Tsukamoto and Alejandro Jodorowsky, director Tom Tykwer achieves few of their often satisfyingly macabre concoctions.<br /><br />Perhaps the only truly redeeming aspect of the film is the captivating score with a recurring melodic theme that permeates the oftentimes grisly look of the filthy cities portrayed. The major settings, first Paris where Jean-Baptiste is born, and then Grasse where he journeys to discover the secrets of preserving scents, are brilliantly recreated in all their dismal glory. Elaborate costumes and striking imagery are lavishly produced, and the abundance of highly aromatic items nearly burst from the screen.<br /><br />Fans of particularly deranged cinema might find this interesting fantasy palatable, but the majority of moviegoers will probably be paled by Perfume's deficient denouement and its lengthy two-and-a-half hour duration.<br /><br />- Mike Massie.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Who would have thought that a filmmaker who has taken on aliens, fight clubs and the seven deadly sins could come out of five years of seclusion and release one of the most engaging and sprawling American pop epics? Though this may be the second time David Fincher has tackled serial killers, `Zodiac' proves to be the filmmaker's most mature and substantial work yet.<br /><br />While previous successes like `Seven' and `Fight Club' were taut, entertaining dramatic thrillers, the departure he makes with `Zodiac' may come as a surprise to many of \\"Finch's\\" cult following. Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes Fincher has to cover a lot of ground, chronicling the nearly decade long history of cat and mouse games played by The Zodiac Killer and the San Francisco Bay area. Where other director's have tried and failed to capitalize on the subject matter, Fincher, who grew up in the area that the proverbial boogeyman was claiming his victims, translates his childhood nightmares to the big screen through an engrossing story of obsession.<br /><br />`Zodiac' from start to finish is the story of Robert Graysmith's descent into mania over his fascination with the notorious killer. Graysmith, the author of the nonfiction novels upon which the screenplay was based, quickly becomes engrossed in the mystery of these seemingly unconnected strings of murders. From the moment The Zodiac sends his first letter to the San Francisco Chronicle in 1969 claiming responsibility for two separate, gruesome murders we watch as Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes from being a mere spectator to the last remaining hunter of the killer, going so far as to attract the attention of The Zodiac to himself.<br /><br />While there are several gruesome murders staged by Fincher in `Zodiac', the film is more along the lines of a newsroom drama like `All the President's Men'. Thanks to Fincher's mastery of maintaining dramatic tension, piecing together clues from evidence collected by Detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and chasing down anonymous tips with zany reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downy Jr.) becomes a mesmerizing, communal experience. Every time the characters find a new lead to fuel the chase, the audience becomes thoroughly engaged in the plot. With every stumbling block they encounter, the picture forces audiences to share the character's maddening frustration.<br /><br />Though it takes an incredible balancing act to make a film that is nearly three hours in length, `Zodiac' is the first picture to accomplish this feat since Hobbits last graced the big screen. Though quite a bit of this achievement should be credited to the Oscar worthy performances of Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey, it is Fincher's vision which makes `Zodiac' so successful.<br /><br />Though the tension and dark humor that carries `Zodiac' might seem like familiar Fincher, don't expect the MTV shooting and editing style that have been featured in his previous works. Fincher even went back and reshot several key scenes in `Zodiac' to make sure that the focus was placed primarily on the story at hand. The results are spectacular.<br /><br />While shots from `Fight Club' and `Panic Room' seemingly existed in an empty vacuum of style, every camera angle in `Zodiac' serves to further the story. Don't expect the camera to go through floorboards and walls; Fincher has finally found a way to balance what is visually enticing with how to tell an absorbing story.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals, credit has to be given to cinematographer Harris Savides for creating a moody, film look on high definition video. Still thought by many stuffy Hollywood hotshots to be an inferior visual medium, Fincher and Savides have added yet another gorgeous example as to why films shot in HD are a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />With `Zodiac' David Fincher has moved from merely being a stylistic director of a handful of cult classics into a master filmmaker. The five year hiatus and the engrossing obsessionwith The Zodiac Killer have served the filmmaker well; he has harnessed his keen visual style with his storytelling abilities to create the first truly substantial piece of cinema in 2007.<br /><br />-Joe Russoas harnessed his keen visual style with his storytelling abilities to create the first truly substantial piece of cinema in 2007.       -Joe Russo

But that aside, I learned so much about what these guys go through to become a Seal, and especially what this man and his buddies did to protect you and me.  I plan to purchase at least one more copy and am telling the people who read it to pass it on to still others to read.  We owe it to the memories of those who died and to this True Hero, to read this book.  The history and even the details of the Afghan tribal people is fascinating as well.
1591841666|5.0|The book has some long term utility -- despite it's lightweight appearance. The main concept rests on your shoulder, like a little angel, whispering \\"push through it\\" when you're mired in a bit of stuckness and \\"bail out\\" when you're up against something futile. There's more to it, of course, but, thanks to this book, I frequently find myself asking, \\"is this a dip?\\"
0553588486|4.0|This is an excellent fantasy and historical fiction novel.  This novel is fiction, but you can recognize the inspiration; that being the 15th century War of The Roses. The main characters from both families, the Lannisters and Starks(=Lancasters and Yorks)are well done.  You might even want to read on this event.<br /><br />The fantasy is well done in that the magic is not used as a Deux ex Machina to get a likable character out of a jam.  In fact some likable characters die before this first installment is over.  With the fantasy aspect you are sometimes left wondering, would things have gone so well in LOTR if the Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves,and Men were having these types of quarrels amongst themselves?  Sauron would be on the move amassing his Orcs and other beasts.  The Good guys would be planning war against people they should be allying with to win, ignoring what was going on elsewhere.  You only see the faint beginnings in this installment.<br /><br />Warning, this is adult fiction, there is graphic sex and violence in this novel.  I don't think this is gratuitous, however, it is sometimes excessive.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|It happens to be the year 2027. Women can no longer conceive children. The whole world has broken out into a riot. Theo(Academy-Award Nominee, Clive Owen), is just a plain worker. He is upset about losing his son to a disease several years ago. Often, when he walks the streets of London, he always comes across some sort of explosion or fight. He sees shooting and violence everywhere(pretty creepy).       One day, while he is coming back from work, he is attacked and thrown into a van. He is then locked up in a room. Suddeny, Theo sees in the shadow the face of a familiar woman. It happens to be his estranged wife, Julian (Academy-Award Nominee, Julianne Moore). She apologizes for leaving him, and gives the typical excuse of \\"everytime I looked at you, you reminded me of our lost child), so typial. Julian asks a favor of Theo. After meeting for a few more times he agrees, they then get into a car with a few of her friends, and as they are driving they come across another riot. Theo just thinks its just a normal riot, but its not. Suddenly, a guy on a motorbike comes and shoots Julian through the window in the neck. She is instantly killed. Theo later finds out that Julian wanted Theo to save a woman named Khee. She is pregnant. It happens to be a big deal. He takes her all through England, until she is finally safe. He goes through so many riots. Then eventually, he is shot. Jasper (Academy-Award Winner, Michael Caine), also tries to help, but he is fatally shot as well. It is such a silly movie, and it was very depressing. I didn't really like it. Julianne Moore's role is very small, and for her character to die like that, was very disheartening. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Surprisingly it seems to be very popular, and it is considered a great movie. However, I don't think it is. Clive Owen and Julianne Moore have done much better films. See Closer, Derailed for Owen. Or others like The Forgotten, or Freedomland for Moore(who has plenty of screentime in both). If you don't like depressing movies, and if you are looking at a heroic action flick, DON'T!

B000002I2M|4.0|L.A. Woman is the Doors' final album with Jim Morrison on lead vocal.  Like its predecessor Morrison Hotel, this album is also excellent, considering that Morrison by this time was basically at death's door (he died in Paris not long afterward).<br /><br />Morrison's vocals on L.A. Woman sound much like an old man's, which adds a bit of ambience to the whole record. The band is in fine form, with Jerry Scheff on bass. Again, when you consider the shape Morrison was in, it's a miracle this record even got made.<br /><br />Like Morrison Hotel, it's extremely blues-oriented. The Changeling is a table-busting jam, and Texas Radio and The Big Beat is terrrific.  Hyacinth House is appropriately creepy, as is Cars Hiss By My Window.<br /><br />And like all Doors albums, it's got the hits:  Love Her Madly, L.A. Woman (one of my all-time favorites), and Riders on the Storm, which many hate. But as the last song on the album, I see it as a fine way for the Bozo Dionysius (Lester Bangs' term for Morrison) to say goodbye.<br /><br />L.A. Woman is not as good as Morrison Hotel, but still terrific and worth owning.
B000J10ERO|2.0|After watching this DC Comics adaptation, I recommend that you see the original 1 & 2 of this franchise. YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO RENT THESE 2 ORIGINALS SO THAT YOU CAN APPRECIATE THIS FRANCHISE. Christopher Reeve played a convincing Superman. The original 1 & 2 are far superior to this film.<br /><br />The cast did a fine enough job and the visuals/camera/film style were neat, but the story really lacked in thrills. I never found myself geeked in anticipation of the next moment. You could freeze the dvd and not care how long of a break you took from it. So what if the burrito takes 3.5 minutes to nuke! Toward the end of this movie, I was wondering if the end was going to ever get there. The conclusion was simply \\"the conclusion...and then the credits\\". I was thinking \\"ok, it ended there, I am so unexcited right now\\".<br /><br />The Entire X-Men Franchise, Spiderman 1 & 2, Blade 1, Daredevil....Marvel has done a better job so far. Stan Lee, please keep showing up for us!!!
B000Q76K24|1.0|Yes, The Good Shepherd, the Worst Movie...truly, one of the very worst movies I have EVER seen.  I saw it when it first came out with a group of seven friends.  ALL seven agreed to walk out after the first fifty minutes or so.  No-one could take the torture of the work over plot and even worse, the wooden acting.  While Matt Damon is never the most emotional actor, in this role he outdid Kevin Costner in the hello-I-am-a-wooden-cigar-indian acting.  What is it about Hollywood that they think they can donn a few fedoras and fifties/sixties spectacles, presume conspiratorial theories and think they can teach history with effete aplomb? - Completely bogus and unsupported.  Fortunately DeNiro supplies the comic relief as he fulfills a completely out of place F-word scene to demonstrate his own true limited range.  Having trouble sleeping?  Watch this film.  Otherwise, pass on all counts.    I gave this film 1 star only because there was no zero!
0684135051|5.0|This book was mentioned in another knitting book that I checked out of the library as being a book of encouragement.  Truly it was. I also found it at the library and thought it so good and inspiring that I bought it here.  Mrs. Zimmerman is witty and encouraging and empowers you to knit what you see and want without worrying about goofing.  She has given me the courage to change patterns around--successfully I might add!  This book is a gem.
B00005JPCF|2.0|After all the hype and advertising that I saw on TV I thought it was a winner.  Much to my dismay rather than a winner it was a wiener.  After 15 minutes of this animated wonder I was bored.  I have tried to watch it over a number of times and still fall asleep before it's half over.  I will admit that the animation was well done but the plot was stupid and seemed to go on forever getting nowhere.

0375703764|1.0|I truly can't begin to describe how awful this book is. Did some of these reviewers even read the same book I did?  This has to be one of the least scary, most boring books I have ever read.  It isn't even well written. The story is weak.  The way in which it is compiled is perhaps \\"new\\", but it is new for a reason; it makes the book a near impossible work to read.  I tried to battle my way through this book numerous times in the past but all the forays into things that don't matter to the story caused me to lose interest.  I recently picked it up and pushed on through it and what am I left with?  No story, that's for sure.  People exploring a house and hearing growling noises gets old.  There is very little suspense in this book and no pay off. This story isn't funny either.  It attempts to be at times, but the humour is so contrived it falls flat. The whole \\"Truant\\" section was unbearable.  Why do I have to read about some guy's numerous sexual encounters in a horror book?  I suppose some readers might gasp or find them shocking enough to hold their interest.  All they did was bore me, and add a whole bunch more crap I had to plow through.  All this book amounts to is a gimmick.
6305428042|5.0|This was a very funny movie with Midler, Parker, and Najimy at their best. I saw this movie for the first time at a movie theater. It was wonderful. When it was available on vhs I bought it immediately, but I noticed that the supermarket scene with the Sanderson sisters had been left out. It was one of my favorite scenes of the movie and it was even pictured on the back cover of the box and referenced in the vhs. Even though that particular scene was edited out from the original theatrical film on the vhs, it was still worth the purchase. I do not know if the supermarket scene was restored when the film was released on dvd, but it would be great if it was. This was a great movie for Midler. She really played her part to the max. Parker and Najimy were exellent as well.
B000T46O8O|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in quite a while. This film is understated as to mimic reality. I found some of myself in it. It reminded me of how much work can suck, how great flirting and love feels and how powerful the written word can be when converted into action.

Excellent cast make this heads and shoulders above most films of this nature. I personally hate beauty contest and pre-pubescent ones are totally sick and should be banned! The little girl's seemingly outrageous performance at the end is priceless and it shows just how brainwashed and delusional these people participating in this garbage are! A bold and important statement in this film! Bravo!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie with an excellent message. We can not allow the government to think for us. The Government must not be allowed to treat us like servants when we are the ones that put them in power.
B00005JL78|4.0|This movie has all the makings of a classic.  Great Sci-Fi with a turn the tables story that is compelling and engaging.  Just enough in the way of special effects as to not detract from the story but to convey a future of both optimism and the terror associated with too much trust in technology and human institutions.<br /><br />In all, great storytelling!
B000L4G05Y|5.0|Who hasn't received teacher newsletters or PTA flyers in the cubbybag of the sweet urchin returning to the family nest every afternoon. The parent sorts through the spelling tests, free-time drawings, and English writing lessons in search of the weekly newsletter sent by the teacher.     But first, have a spot of tea. Lean back and relax in anticipation of the sweet innocence and unfailing optimism about to be so touchingly crafted in this message from the teacher. The opening sentence of a paragraph about a recent field trip to the zoo is read. And read again. And reread one more time.    \\"The kides, excitement, new no bounds. The class brought along it's camera, All most from the time the gates open our class. Different assistant was given too supervise manage, and keep together their group's as their was so much to see and it was! Truly. a sight! . . .\\"    The newsletter goes on to share amusing stories of the students on their trip, their reactions to the various exhibits, and the gentle sound of snoring that filled the bus on its return trip home. (This remains still open to interpretation since the reader is left with only her own personal skill level in decrypting the remainder of the missive.)    As another writer who is compelled by a Higher (lower?) Power to enforce a  Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation, I am in a quandary. Red pen poised above the newsletter, I am ready to strike a blow not ONLY in the name of Punctuation, but Grammar, Syntax, and Spelling as well!     A timely breeze of reality blows through my mind. This was written by my daughter's first grade teacher. She is also the passer-outer of gold stars, smiles, band-aids, security and emotional support for my daughter. Perhaps bleeding all over the paper with what is sure to be a gallon of red ink before all is finished is not the best way to go. Once again, I will request a quiet parent conference for which I will leave my red pen at home and pack my happy pills instead.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|Michael, Michael, Michael...Why is it when Hollywood catches wind of a new military aircraft (or specifically Michael Bay) they (he) feel(s) it necessary to incorporate it into their (his) summer blockbuster film? Does anyone remember the F-117 in Executive Decision? The technical advisor on that film should NEVER be allowed to \\"advise\\" again! Using an F-117 as a troop transport was bad enough but the link up to the Jet Liner was even more absurd!   I honestly had to check and see if Michael Bay produced that film too.      Anyway, back to Die Hard 4.0. I was loving the movie right up to the point when the F-35 popped up on screen. I was thinking to myself, \\"Great! another True Lies, Executive Decision gone bad!\\" I was right. Not only was the aircraft's abilities grossly misrepresented the pilot couldn't even hit a SEMI-TRUCK! COME ON! I'm only glad Bruce didn't jump in the cockpit after the pilot ejected...YOU KNOW BAY THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THOUGH!  Anyway, aside from the F-35 and the shot of the Predator with jet propulsion (it's a single prop UAV) I enjoyed the film.    UPDATE AFTER TRANSFORMERS 1&2:  Has Michael Bay even seen an MQ-1 Predator?   It's equipped with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine (you know a \\"prop job\\" like a small Cessna), NOT a turbofan (jet) engine like the RQ-4 Global Hawk.  He's gotten this WRONG in at least three of his latest summer blockbusters.  If you think I'm being picky just ask ANY active or retired military member about the liberties he takes with military personnel, equipment, structures, facilities, etc.   Sometimes I think he must be using Cobra Commander and General Hawk as his military advisors!!

My copy is NOT the Limited edition version but has the same flaw. I don't know if the other reviewer posted under the wrong version or both versions has the same flaw.  As for the movie , I am a big fan of Ghost in a Shell and love them all. And as for one reviewer's questions, it is dubbed into English by them same crew.
B000SSV8HI|5.0|This 4 DVD set packs a wallop.  Each DVD could easily stand on its own, but together you get some of the best live Stones ever.  The extras and production value are great.

B000M341QE|2.0|The only thing  amazing about this film is all the hype. Oscar winner? Scorcese is getting on in years; maybe they wanted to throw him a golden bone? You know his judgement is slipping every time he casts Leonardo in roles he can't handle. Even the number of little continuity slips from shot to shot just groan with signs that the old master's touch has dissipated long ago.    This thing looks and sounds like it was made by the boys on the force. And speaking of boys, Scorcese should have realized that putting Nicholson into the pool with little 'uns like Damon, DiCaprio, and Wahlberg only emphasizes the fact that they're still not ready to play grown men. They can't even spit out the endless stream of f*#@%-letter-words without sounding like they came right out of a script. And listen to how every one of them sounds like they were trained by the same accent coach.    I agree with another reviewer, the thing's a mess. Only in America can you produce such mediocrity and have it stamped with excellence. I say God Bless Jack Nicholson!

B000QEIOTO|5.0|This is a terrifc movie for a weekend and while much fuss was made over particular omissions from Ludlum's great spy novel, the overall feel of the world he created remains. If every element from Ludlum's  novel were left in this would be a five hour movie. The book was that complex and jam-packed.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman has retained the basic feel of the book and left the heart of the story in tact. He didn't try to glamourize the grittier aspects simply because he had a big budget with which to work. There is almost a low-key atmosphere which somehow makes all the action seem more real to the viewer. We see Paris and all the other countries only as background to the dark storyline we hope can have some kind of happy resolution as the film goes along.<br /><br />Franke Potente is perfect as a girl who has no real roots herself, and what begins as a business proposition escalates into love, even if it must be a life on the run with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Damon proves he can really act in this film and does a great job as Bourne, a guy who has no idea who he is but has all the instincts of someone not quite part of everyday society.<br /><br />A Swiss bank account and a dozen passports, along with a large sum of cash and a weapon, tells him something about what kind of life he has led, if not who he is exactly. He ponders the mystery in a Paris cafe with Marie (Potente) while instinctively making note of all the liscence plates of the vehicles parked outside. Why he does so, he doesn't know.<br /><br />The romance that blossoms between Bourne and Marie becomes one more reason Bourne must find the answers to his identity as international assasins come after them at every turn. There is a moment in the film when he tries to make her leave him for safety because he loves her, and it is for that same reason she stays.<br /><br />This is a gritty movie with a heart. The action sequences as Bourne's instincts kick in are terrific and the human elements are not lost along the way, which is a credit to Director Liman and the two stars, especially Damon, who separtated himself from a big pack and proved he had talent here.<br /><br />We are left with a good feeling at the end of this film as both the action and romance are given their moments. I read this many years ago so perhaps the fact it was not fresh in my mind helped me enjoy it more. Taken simply as a really enjoyable film for a weekend, it's A+ entertainment.o Director Liman and the two stars, especially Damon, who separtated himself from a big pack and proved he had talent here.

1401302378|5.0|Different types of books serve different purposes, some books tell great stories that motivate and inspire us, other books give practical \\"how to\\" advice, others enable us to escape to a world miles away from reality, while others help us make sense of a world that we otherwise wouldn't understand. I love books that fall into the last category. Some of the recent \\"classics\\" in this category include The Tipping Point (Malcolm Gladwell), The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki) and The World is Flat (Tomas Friedman).    The Long Tail is a brilliant book written with similar wisdom and research as these \\"classics\\". In the Long Tail, Chris Andersen (Editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of the Long Tail) explains how the internet is creating distinct shifts in economics and culture. The internet provides consumers with more choice and better search capabilities across different products enabling them to make buying decisions that link closely to their specific interests and needs. This ultimately means that for certain niche products there is an increase in both supply and demand. The internet creates more consumer choice, therefore the demand curve for goods is flattening meaning there is less demand the traditionally popular items (e.g. Brittany Spears and Wilber Smith) and more demand for traditionally less popular items (e.g. Nikolaus Von Knorring, a Swedish soft rock artist and Saltwater Fly Tying, a book by Frank Wentink) creating a long tail on the demand curve. The author uses a number of different and interesting examples to illustrate this phenomenon. In the case of books, a traditional bookstore (e.g. Exclusive Books in South Africa) will typically stock up to 150000 titles in its largest store. This means that consumers must find what they want in amongst those 150000 titles if they are to buy a book. At the same time it is pretty difficult to search books in a bookstore because you physically need to browse through titles on the shelf. The result of this is that certain \\"blockbuster\\" books are pushed and less popular books with a niche focus are ignored. The internet changes this equation completely. Firstly, [...] offers the consumer access to 4.5 million book titles and enables them to search for very specific themes and topics in amongst those 4.5 million titles. This means that titles that were previously ignored are being purchased by individuals with very specific interests. In my own case I recently found a book on [...] entitled \\"Researching Entrepreneurship\\" written by a Professor from Brisbane. 15 years ago I would probably never have even known that this title existed whereas now I was able to purchase it and search other titles purchased by people with the same interest. This concept is exaggerated in the world of music because digital music is not only stored and marketed on the internet, but online music it is highly searchable and is downloadable meaning that you don't even need to rely on a courier service to deliver the end product.    As we look to the future the Long Tail concept has important implications for:  Movies and DVD's with a shift from the traditional DVD store and cinema to Netflix and online movie downloads;  Newspapers and magazines with a shift away from paper toward online publishing and blogs;  Travel with a shift away from travel agents towards self service via the internet.  The Long Tail phenomenon is happening and is becoming more and more important as bandwidth increases and more and more products and marketed and sold via the internet.

In the \\"Book Made To Stick\\" brothers Chip and Dan Heath explore what makes ideas sticky. Chip is a business school professor at Stanford and Dan is a teacher and textbook publisher. They combine an entertaining blend of case studies and startling research to illustrate a practical, tangible strategy for communicating ideas so that people will remember and act upon them. With effective communication playing such an important role in business, the ideas in this book are invaluable to anyone involved in, or looking to get involved in advertising, journalism, marketing, politics or general management.     To craft a powerful  SUCCES formula: SUCCES is an acronym for the 6 six principles for effective communication of an idea:      1. Simplicity - Strip an idea to its core, prioritize and create proverbs if possible that are both simple and profound.   2. Unexpectedness - To get an audience to pay attention and maintain their interest, one must violate their expectations. This often involves being counterintuitive.   3. Concreteness - Ideas should be communicated in terms of specific human actions and concrete images. Avoid jargons (such as mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions) that often seem meaningless.  4. Credibility - People are more likely to embrace ideas if believable images are conveyed or if people with credibility share the message.    5. Emotions - Why should people care? You have to make people feel or experience something, such as disgust at the unhealthiness of one thing or resentment at the duplicity of the villain depicted.   6. Stories - Get people to act by telling stories to build a richer, more complete feel for the situation or mentally rehearse what will have to be done. This will enable an audience to respond more quickly and effectively when the real thing is encountered in daily life.     In other words they suggest that we \\"Create messages that are simple and unexpected and concrete and credentialed and that contain an emotional story.\\"     This book is well researched, easy to read and hard to forget.

Set in Peterborough in the early 1990s the story is narrated by Nadia, who, like the author is the child of Ukrainian refugees, born in the end of Second World War, and therefore as `peace baby'. They grew up in the adoptive country and know only by stories the problems parents and older siblings faced during the conflict.<br /><br />Nadia's father, Nikolai, seems to get over his wife's death some time ago, and has arranged to marry an Ukrainian immigrant half his age. To Nadia and her sister, this woman is clearly setting up for their father. And they try to talk him off. This is what happens most of time in the narrative.<br /><br />However funny and interesting \\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\\" is, it lacks some sort of development both in characters and narrative. Most of the time, people are just talking, and events are filtered through Nadia's eyes. Actually more than half of the book people talk by phone. Therefore, Lewycka establishes an easy pattern she follows. Every segment there is an introduction, and then the conversation.<br /><br />It is a relief when this pattern is broke and the narrative floats in another form. What the writer lacks in narrative skills she compensates in tone, mood and feeling. This novel clearly captures what was to be an Eastern European immigrant. Nadia listens from her father and sister how they managed to survive war and to adapt in the new home.<br /><br />Nikolai is writing a book called \\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\\" and his book inside the narrative, clearly, is not just his book. This is some sort of metaphor that Lewycka uses to dig deeper inside something else, and writes about the human condition and our relationship - sometimes positive, sometimes negative - to machinery and other beings.

B000FZETIO|5.0|Now, Molly Ringwald had to be my most favourite actor of the 80's. This story is sweet too. Being an outcast through highschool, Andy (Molly Ringwald), is a budding designer and she makes up all of her clothes, but gets ridiculed by the popular girls. Who doesn't get teased? But Andy likes Blane, a rich kid who has money and hangs out with the popular crowd. Then there is Duckie, Andy's loyal friend who is totally in love with her, and is against Andy wanting to go out with Blane, as he thinks he will break her heart. And there is Stef (James Spader), who wants Andy, but Andy does not want him. So Stef gets to Blane trying to make out that Andy is crazy and that she is not worth dating. But Blane still likes her. They go out on a few dates, and then he pulls away from her and she gets angry. Then the prom comes, and Duckie takes Andy to the prom and tells her that Blane is a nice guy and not like the others. So Blane sees Andy and she is upset. he walks up to her and tell sher that he loves her. Then he walks away. Andy stares after him, and Duckie tells her to go after him. And so ends the movie of them kissing in the carpark.  A great ending that shows no matter what social class you come from, love will always conquer.
1600240003|5.0|I love all the Harry Bosch's books.  This audiobook does not disappoint and the story has enough twists to keep you guessing.
0385338600|4.0|As in \\"A Painted House\\", A Time To Kill\\" takes you there. Grisham has that ability to make you feel like your are at that diner in Clanton, Mississippi with Jake having breakfast, in the court room listening to the trial, or sharing in the many pictures of margaritas with Jake, Ellen, Harry Rex, and Lucien. This book makes you think of the story when you are not reading it and you find yourself wondering what happens next. That is what makes a book enjoyable for me to read. Only by reading this one can you decide: Was it a time to kill???
0375831002|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  So descriptive.   I've also listened to the audio book read by Allen Corduner.  He is the perfect narrator for this book.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|This doco-movie is a great one to watch, involving a young Arnold Schwrzenegger. Wacthing him train and pump is body is mind boggling. And then there is the young Bill bixby who is also traing to compete against Arnie and is incredibly deaf. The images of him pumping iron with his Father watching and training him is great stuff. The dedication that these men put into their training is amazing and makes for a fascinating watch. Even if you are not a huge fan of the body building industry, it is still a great doco to watch, and you won't help but feel admiration for what they do to their bodies.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I loved this movie, being such a huge fan of the original, as well as Masamune Shirow but they sure bungled the DVD in Amercia. No worry, simply buy the British (Region 2) or Australian (Region 4) DVD because they feature a full English-language dialogue track featuring the entire voice cast of the Stand Alone Complex series! Not only that, but the artwork is the original theatrical art, not that wanky Cartoon Network looking crap they forced on us in the US. Trust me, it's worth the import prices to see this movie they way it was meant for English audiences, not spending the entire film reading the bottom of the screen, and missing half the action.
B00005JPLW|4.0|First off, if you're seeing this movie in the belief that it will be historically accurate please prepare for disappointment. This film is based on a graphic novel which in turn is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae. Any of the 1 start reviewers here could have flipped the DVD cover over, Googled the film or picked up a newspaper to learn this before writing their reviews which blast it for historical inaccuracies. If that's what you're looking, for this is a 1 star movie, move on and save yourself a couple hours.<br /><br />I was intellectually capable of finding that hidden nugget of information out before seeing the film so I had no such expectations. I loved Sin City and brought some expectations from that experience and found a very different movie. The film is absolutely beautiful and seemed to me to capture the graphic novel perfectly. The sepia tones, the costumes and the 600 bulging pectorals made for a pretty cool war movie. The action was fun but a tad slow for my taste. I understand why the Director choose not to show the true power of a hoplite army. It would not have fit the style of the film and instead the individuality during the battle was far more appropriate.<br /><br />That said, there is near zero character development. It was disappointing but the stunning visuals made this far more worthy of my $10. This version of the DVD maybe help flesh out some of the characters (it certainly can't lessen it) and breath some humanity into the characters allwoing them to become truly heroic. It might also help humanize at least 1 of the \\"1,000 nations of the Persian Empire\\" who were pretty much villianized. I disagree with the reviewers who this this is Bush propaganda as well. The film follows the novel which was written before 9/11.<br /><br />Overall the film gives ytou some better than average action and a hell of a lot of eye candy that make up for the lack of anything resembling a character. I treated it like an amusement park ride. For the 3 minutes I spent on the rollar coaster it was thrilling but once it ended I just wanted a longer and more intense ride.rollar coaster it was thrilling but once it ended I just wanted a longer and more intense ride.
B000000WA4|5.0|No doubt, it's a must-have album. It's a double-cd album. I found there're two versions of this album. One version comes in a double jewel case, the other comes in a standard jewel case . Could anyone tell which version it is? Thanks
1558908382|4.0|Another great movie with John Cusack in it. It's a romantic comedy of a guy who is a hitman, and ends up back in the town he went to highschool. There he finds his ex-girlfriend played by Minnie Driver. There is also the highschool reunion on and he has to find time to see his ex as well as do a hit. Great comedy and great music, this should be in any dvd collection. Witty dialouge with a small giggle here and there. Something to watch when there is nothing on Tv.
0192805606|5.0|Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941) was a well known writer, critic, feminist, and publisher. This was her fifth novel.<br /><br />As background information, I read her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" published in 1915, skipped her second novel - which is considered to be a flop, Night and Day from 1919 - and then read \\"Jacob's Room,\\" her third, then went on and read \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" her fourth, and next read \\"To The Lighthouse,\\" etc. Also, I read some of Woolf's non-fiction.<br /><br />\\"The Voyage Out\\" is simple and straightforward work and it might remind the reader of a Jane Austen novel, but it set on a ship and then at a remote location. It is over 400 pages long, and has an Austen theme. After her second novel - which did not do very well - Woolf decided to be more risky and creative with the next book. She changed her style and approach to the novel and Woolf uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring a sense of the chaos and shortness of a young man's life around the time of World War I, Jacob's life, i.e.: from the pandemonium of Jacob's life as portrayed by Woolf through the use of the stream of the consciousness technique, we eventually have clarity in the novel. She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story in the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"<br /><br />This is her third novel using her stream of consciousness technique and she does it in a very dramatic fashion. The story is centered on the life of Mrs. Ramsay, a beautiful woman in her early fifties, and her older husband, and their eight children, plus other guests and neighbors and domestic help all at a beach house somewhere in Scotland on a warm summer day. Her husband is an academic and a bit remote. Mrs. Ramsay is more down to earth and mostly loved and admired by all.<br /><br />As in the novel \\"Jacob's Room\\" the reader is left dangling as Woolf moves from character to character, giving the reader glimpses of their inner emotions. It is hard to determine what Woolf is doing and where she is going. But what she seems to be doing is celebrating a moment in a life. This is done very effectively with the stream of consciousness technique, and very dramatically as the story proceeds. The prose is brilliant and awe inspiring in some spots, and we see the genius of Woolf.<br /><br />To say a lot more would ruin the story for the reader, but most will appreciate the way the story unfolds, and it unfolds very dramatically after a seemingly slow and complex start. The change has an effect on the reader - or so I found. Some think that it is Woolf's finest work and it would be hard to find fault with that assessment. She takes her ideas from \\"Jacob's Room\\" and applies them to a more complicated and dramatic setting at a family get together at a beach house, and it works.<br /><br />This is a must read novel.seems to be doing is celebrating a moment in a life.

B000FZETKC|5.0|this movie has to be one of my most favourite movies from the 80's. Eric Stolz plays a quiet guy who likes the popular girl in school, who has a boyfriend is such a player. Then he has his best friend Watts, who is so in love with him and this sets up a triangle of sorts. The best scene is when Keith (Eric Stolz), turns up at the party that Arty is having, and stands up to him in front of all his friends. Just goes to show that the tough guy can be intimidated and look like a loser. Great soundtrack too, and it's so 80's that i love watching it over and over.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|As always, BBC doco's are a cut above the rest. The quality of footage, the narration and general quality of the series is amazing. The HD component ( I watched mine on 1080I ) is simply stunning. 10/10.
B000PY52EU|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie at my local theatre, I was intrigued.  The marketing department had done their job and established that Christina Ricci's character had a sexual addiction and after a rough night, ends up at Samuel L. Jackson's house.  What gripped the viewers was the twist: she's chained to the radiator and he won't let her go.    I started wondering what the hell the movie could be about.  How were they going to develop an entire script (although I wondered the same thing about \\"Saw\\" before I saw it)?  Either way, I needed to see this film.    Sadly, I don't recall seeing this movie in theatres at all (and I was loosely looking).  The trailer didn't give me a release date and before I knew it, here it is on DVD.  Now that I've seen the film, I must say that I am in love with it.  Unfortunately, judging from the progress of this film so far, it will die the sleeper film death and eventually only be known as an entry on \\"Mr. Skin's\\" web site because Ricci is topless multiple times throughout the movie.     The plot develops like a well-laid plan.  We're never left in the dark too long, but we also aren't fed the plot and it's relatively unpredictable.  Jackson delivers a fantastic performance of an aged African-American living in a poor Southern town.  What is even more dynamic is that, while similar, it doesn't repeat his great performance in \\"A Time To Kill\\".  Ricci delviers another solid performance (recent films like \\"Prozac Nation\\", \\"The Opposite of Sex\\", and even \\"Monster\\" have been building on her talent).  She obviously lost a lot of weight for this role and the subsequent large sunken eyes compliment her character wonderfully.  It was difficult, at times, imagining the young girl who refused to be naked in \\"The Opposite of Sex\\" when faced with the lustful powerhouse she transformed herself into for this role.  Justin Timberlake also has a small role as Ricci's boyfriend and gives a tender and endearing performance.  I must say that Timberlake impressed the most, even though he was the weakest performance of the three.    This movie combines trauma, sex, idiosyncracies, racism, and the wonderful tunes of the blues into a rough ride through one girl's struggle.  Your emotions will be on a roller coaster as you find yourself loving, feeling sorry for, and hating Ricci and Jackson at times.  If you're tired of the same old same old that Hollywood has been cranking out in record numbers, give this movie a try, it will impress.

After being paid to find all the books of the devil, Johnny Depp finds himself being in the most trickiest situations and there always seems to be a woman who is there and helps him. Is she the devil? Of course another great movie that Johnny Depp is in. It's a confusing movie for those who are not up to speed about the devil , so watch this movie a few times and i am sure you will be able to understand it more, and you will end up seeing things that you missed when you watch it over and over again.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Clive Davis had no idea what he was talking about when he told kelly they record wasnt gonna be a smash. Its been out for 3 weeks and it has sold just shy of 500,000 copies(which she will hit next week making MD Gold in only four weeks!) This cd has no filler songs on it. Every song is a hit.<br />From the Guitar roaring songs like \\"Hole\\",\\"Haunted\\",\\"Never Again\\", and \\"Judas\\" to the beautiful ballads like \\"Be Still\\",\\"Sober\\",\\"Maybe\\", and \\"Irvine\\" and the pop rock favs \\"How I Feel\\",\\"One Minute\\",\\"Dont Waste Your Time\\", and \\"Yeah\\". This cd is amazing! It proves that Kelly Clarkson isnt just a world class singer but and amazing writer, Clarkson wrote all 13 songs on the cd. This cd is a must have for any pop/rock lover! Kelly Clarkson has out done herself once again.<br />ps cant wait for the next record! Country here she comes!
B00009V7OL|4.0|WHEN I GOT THIS CD SET I WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH IT. THE SHIPPING TOOK NO TIME AT ALL AND ARRIVED FASTER THAN I EXPECTED. THE MOVIE CD WAS GREAT AND I LOVED THE ADDED MATERIAL. THE BONUS CD WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING THOUGH. BUT ALL IN ALL I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO ALL.
B000002NJS|5.0|This further proves the fact that Madonna is a steady and everlasting presence in the world of music. Like with her previous albums she secures her place, not to be removed. This particular album solidifies her as a steady and continuous hit making machine. \\"The power of goodbye\\" quickly became one of my favorite songs, it's message is constant and impacting one, and \\"Frozen\\" is also unforgettable and if you've been through things in relationships these songs are easy to identify with. Madonna effortlessly brings us lyrics to cherish in a world of relentless chaos. Yoga, palates, and love of music keeps her looking flawless so she not only offers great music but ageless photos as well.
0790729628|5.0|How do you explain this movie? I guess you just have to watch it and try to understand it. Certainly a movie for those who love to watch Harrison Ford, and Rutger Hauer. Sean Young is quite good in it too. Set in the future, it's crazy and noisy. He has to try and find androids and kill them. But is he one himself?

B000PTYP7U|5.0|When I first became interested in Paramore's music in mid-2006, I had a hard time finding a decent, helpful review for their debut CD All We Know Is Falling. Most of the reviews for the CD were from what appeared to be teenage boys, discussing, not the CD quality, but the level of attractiveness of the band's lead singer. Okay, we get it, Hayley's hot. While this was to be expected, it was not helpful. So, I purchased the CD, it was amazing, story goes on. It wasn't until this CD came out that I felt the need to actually write a review. First of all, I'd just like to say, this is a big, mature, natural step-up for Paramore. Their lyrics have improved as have Hayley's vocals and the bands musicianmanship (word?). Where All We Know feels more personal and rough, RIOT! is more polished and just better. This time around, the band steps in with 11 heavy hitting tracks that more can relate to lyrically (as opposed to the All We Know era) and enjoy musically. At their best, Paramore hit high notes (figuratively and literally), with their single Misery Business, Miracle, Fences, the fan song Born For This, That's What You Get, soft, beautiful ballad When It Rains, and the pop-rock guilty pleasure (if guilty pleasures existed) crushcrushcrush. That's What You Get especially showcases the talent of young Zac Farro, who finds the pockets in the songs and doesn't let up the heavy drum parts that bring the song full circle and in your face. Hayley Williams continuely shows off her enviable vocals skills and Jeremy Davis and Josh Farro show off themselves, with their skills in bass and guitar (respectively). Although no songs fall flat, the aforementioned are the best of the bunch. Be it their youth, boundless enthusiasm (Be sure to compliment Jeremy's pants), or just their plain in your face talent, if you didn't like Paramore before, you are sure to fall in love with them now.
B000002MUW|5.0|Madonna is like a timeless piece of jewelry or better yet, a bottle of wine that only gets better with time. She can't be out dated or because of her talents be understated. She represents a form of evolution that secures her place in the world of entertainment and further places her at the top of a list of legendary players. With Bedtime Stories she proved that with right amount of talent you can change your tune a bit and still be on top. She has been a favorite of mine for many years, I've been listening to Madonna since before I entered my teen years and will share her music with my children. Bedtime Stories is a different Madonna but still Madonna nonetheless.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Being in college never looked so good. As part of a fraternity that never graduates, two guys are pledged into the fraternity and let the games begin. There is the toga party and stealing of food from the supermarket. the best part of the film is when they get booted off campus and everything is stripped from their frat house. John Belushi is funny in trying to cheer up everyone. And the most favourite part is the street fair. These guys certainly had fun in college. A great classic movie to watch even now, has a great following. And i am sure there will be more generations to come to discover this movie and take it to their hearts as well.
B000S9WLBY|4.0|Enjoyable.  Even my wife watched through the entire movie - subtitles and all.  I thought one seen was somewhat bashing to the Marine Corp but it could be true.  I think the Japanese soldiers were far more finatical than portrayed in the movie - according to stories my uncle told me. Yep, he was there to know in person.    Overall a good movie.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this science/ earth documentary.  I love it.  I don't usually watch videos more than once.  Not true with this one.  Don't think I'll ever tire of watching it.  Saw a few episodes of it on TV and knew I needed to own it.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|What do you get when you put 5 teenagers from different social sectors of the high school heirachy in detention on a cold saturday? Lots of laughs and revelations that's what. Having these 5 characters spending a saturday in detention with a demented school principal, things are bound to go wrong. Running the corridors for some food, or sitting upstairs in the library and talking about not wanting to become their parents is tough stuff for this lot. They all realize by the end that they are not all that different. A great John Hughes film about teenage angst set in a high school is great viewing. For those like myself who love the 80's movie, this one is sure to be in any movie buff collection.
B000LXHK2C|1.0|I agree with the negative reviews. Wait until it comes on TV, if you must see it. Save your money.

Watching a young Anthony Michael Hall ham it up as a geek who want to find a gorlfriend and doesn't get anywhere, they decide to build one on their computer, and bam, they get kelly Le Brock instead. All sorts of mayhem ensues and watching Bill Pullman playing the older brother Chip is hilarious. Another movie to stick in your movie collection if you are a huge fan of the 80's genre.

I already own the original release of The Poison, so I was a little hesitant to order this for 4 new tracks and a dvd. I wish I had bought it as soon as i noticed it. The extra tracks are amazing and the dvd is fantastic. BFMV is one of the best new bands I've heard in awhile. The music is melodic and heavy. If you do not own this cd do yourself a favor and buy it. TODAY!!!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Now who doesn't love this movie? being able to sjip school and enjoy the day of visiting the city and having fun? What kid wouldn't like that? A major classic movie of the 80's starring Matthew Broderick. No need to explain his exploits, just watch and laugh with him and his pal Cameron. Another one to stick in your DVD collection.
B000L212HC|5.0|This is my favorite blu-ray movie. It both shows off what HD can do and is a very fun story. I agree with the other reviewer who said you have to really \\"suspend belief\\" on this one. It's hard to follow because you constantly switch between present and flashbacks and aren't sure where you are sometimes, but it is none the less a great movie.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|Wow! For a movie that is in Cantonese, it is absolutley hilarious. Two misfits, dress up and pretend they are part of the Axe Gang thast run the town. Unknown to them, they walk into a village called Pig Sty Alley, where there are three Kung Fu masters and Two Higher Kung Fu masters who live there. They try to act tough and think they can bully the people. Then the real Axe gang show up and mayhem starts from there. But one of the misfits does not realize that he is also a Kung Fu master and by the end of the movie he has to fight the ultimate evil, and he uses and becomes the Kung Fu Master that he was destined to become. A very funny movie, that has a sweet ending. Subtitles are available in most languages. Watch out for the chase scene, that ends with a big billboard.
B000001ESN|5.0|By 1980, Rush had left the large scale compositions behind them and had started to shorten the format.  Interestingly, the band did not sacrifice any of the technical excellence that characterized their music even as they started to inch into the musical mainstream.  In fact, I do remember hearing Spirit of the Radio and Freewill played a lot on the radio and thinking that they were just fantastic tunes.  As I recall, it was the sophistication with which the songs were played that really grabbed me.<br /><br />The lineup on Permanent Waves included bassist extraordinaire Geddy Lee (lead vocals Rickenbacker bass; Oberheim polyphonic synthesizer; OB-1; mini-moog synthesizer; and Taurus bass pedals); Neil Peart (drum kit; and lots of percussion including: tympani; timbales; orchestra bells; tubular bells; wind chimes; bell tree; triangle; and crotales); and Alex Lifeson (6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars; Taurus bass pedals).  This group of only three individuals managed to churn out a wall of sound that sounded as if had been made by an ensemble twice that size.  Their technical ability was astounding too: these guys could rock out in 7/8 just as easily as they could in common time (4/4).  I do recall seeing Rush in concert as a teenaged prog rock fan back in 1981 (Moving Pictures tour) and just being wowed by the performances  - Neil Peart still amazes me, both with his approach to the drums and his lyric writing ability.  As I recall, his drum kit was at an absolute peak of \\"massiveness\\" in 1980 - 1981.<br /><br />The six tunes on Permanent Waves range in length from 3'48\\" to 9'17\\" with most in the 3-6 minute range (this album is a bit short overall).  There is a broad spectrum of music on the album that includes the densely arranged, yet shorter pieces that (somehow) managed to get radio play, to the more prog rock pieces that got me into the band in the first place including Jacob's Ladder and the incredible, riff-heavy progger Natural Science.  The two tracks that I always enjoyed listening to and that somehow seem to fall through the cracks include Entre Nous and Different Strings - both are somewhat quieter and a bit more reflective, yet do not lose the distinctive stamp of Rush's unique brand of progressive hard rock/heavy metal.  Geddy's use of synthesizers is very tasteful and he generates some fairly atmospheric moments in-between the more powerhouse sections of wall shaking, \\"thinking man's\\" progressive metal that made the band famous.<br /><br />This remastered version of the album is about as close as it will get for those folks that never owned the vinyl (the original photos and lyrics to each piece have been included).  As somebody who did buy this on vinyl when it came out, the CD will never hold the same magic, but it did (admittedly) bring back some fond memories.  The sound quality is superb and the production by Terry Brown is excellent.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic example of progressive hard rock/heavy metal and is very highly recommended along with [[ASIN:B000001ESJ A Farewell to Kings]] (1977); my personal favorite ([[ASIN:B000001ESL Hemispheres]], 1978), and [[ASIN:B000001ESP Moving Pictures]] (1981).  For those folks that like this particular brand of progressive rock, a few albums by Kansas are highly recommended including [[ASIN:B00005JA2B Leftoverture]] (1976) and [[ASIN:B00005Y1M3 Point Of Know Return]] (1977).always enjoyed listening to and that somehow seem to fall through the cracks include Entre Nous and Different Strings - both are somewhat quieter and a bit more reflective, yet do not lose the distinctive stamp of Rush's unique brand of progressive hard rock/heavy metal.

1881273156|4.0|Gary Chapman is a marriage counselor and puts on marriage seminars around the country.  Much of his work stems from his \\"Five Love Languages\\" theory, which is here presented.  In \\"The Five Love Languages,\\" Chapman argues that as the infatuation/honeymoon phase of a marriage fades and couples become increasingly comfortable with the routine of being married, it is highly important to identify your spouse's \\"love language.\\"  People are designed to receive messages of love loudest by different means.  Some are designed to hear \\"I love you and appreciate you\\" loudest through compliments; others hear this same message loudest through gifts.  Not only will it be a benefit to your marriage to figure out how you hear love messages best, but it is also important to know how your spouse best hears, \\"I love you.\\"<br /><br />After three introductory chapters, Chapman introduces and explains the five love languages.  They are:  Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.  Chapman then concludes the book with five chapters that apply the love languages theory to particular life situations (e.g. applying the love languages to your children, loving the unlovable).  Finally, two appendixes are included--a quiz for males to help in determining your love language, and another quiz for females.<br /><br />The concept of differing love languages is presented well and the presentation of the love languages themselves are fully explained.  Chapman is wise in employing  the liberal use of anecdotes as this book is not intended to be \\"...an academic treatise...not to those who are studying marriage but to those who are married...(191)\\"  It is intended to be practical and easily applicable to married partners where they are in their relationship right now.  Thus, evidence of its effectiveness is anecdotally based and not scientifically based.  While this reader found it helpful and while my wife and I were able to identify our \\"love languages,\\" it does not necessarily follow that the \\"love language theory\\" will benefit all marriage partners.<br /><br />Two aspects of this book necessitate mention:  filler material and Chapman's religious convictions.  In reality, \\"The Five Love Languages\\" could have been about 50 pages, but few people would spend $14.99 on a 50-page book.  Thus the publishers employed common methods of increasing the number of pages to 203.  The line-spacing appears to be 1.5; the font is large; space is blocked off for quotes; anecdotes go on longer than they really need to; and the opening/closing chapters are not exactly streamlined.  The readers is required to go through a lot of broth before he finds the meat of this book.  Secondly, it should be noted that Chapman is a man who is an adherent to the Christian faith.  The subjects of Chapman's anecdotes are regular church-goers, and Jesus is mentioned frequently--but only as a good moral teacher.  There is no incarnation, no cross, no empty tomb, no return on the last day.  This is not to say that Chapman rejects these foundational pieces of the Christian faith, he just hasn't presented them.  Although Chapman is a Christian, and this book is found in Bible bookstores, I wouldn't call this a \\"Christian book\\" per se.  Those who are Christians will not have their faith fed through \\"The Five Love Languages,\\" and those who do not believe that Jesus is the prophesied Messiah who offers forgiveness of sins as a free gift through faith will not find that faith is required to understand/apply these secular sociological concepts.<br /><br />In all, this book is recommended, especially to engaged or married couples.low that the \\"love language theory\\" will benefit all marriage partners.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I first listened to this space rock classic on eight track cassette sometime in 1979 or, went out and bought the LP, picked up the 1994 CD reissue, and finally upgraded to this fancy SACD version in 2003.  In spite of the fact that I wish they had kept the original cover, the overall package is quite nice and the CD liner notes should prove to be pretty informative for folks new to the group - the CD booklet even includes the original inner gatefold artwork and a few photos from the posters that came with the original LP.<br /><br />Although I have not made use of the SACD layers, the sound quality on this remastered version is just fine (well, at least to my Biologist ears) and I do not regret buying it.  Crisp highs and deep rich bass characterize this reissue and it should sound good on most pieces of stereo equipment.  The Hammond organ and VCS3 synthesizer workouts sound great, Dave's guitar leads cut through, and the bass/drums sound very tight.<br /><br />Listening to this now, it is remarkable how little Dark Side of the Moon has aged.  The concept is universal, so the lyrics will always connect with the listener, regardless of the age of the individual.  Unlike in my teen years however, I do not feel the need to put a red light bulb on to create the proper \\"mood\\" while listening to this album.  Indeed, as an adult I can listen to it anywhere and thanks to the fine remastering job, enjoy it more than ever.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|This album is worth the $9.99 price if only for songs 9-12.  (\\"Rag and Bones\\", \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\", \\"Martyr For My Love For You\\" and finally \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" are the aforementioned songs 9-12).  \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" quickly became my favorite Stripes song ever and will really remind of you the older White Stripes album \\"De Stijl\\".  But don't let my love of this 4 song block distract you from the rest of the album.  The only \\"weak\\" part in my opinion are songs 3, 6, and 7.  The bagpipe sounds like a good idea but I personaly hate those 2 songs.    If you are Stripes fan and love their older work you will love this album.
0765316978|5.0|This is the third (and final) book in Scalzi's trilogy which included his debut novel, Old Man's War and it's sequel, The Ghost Brigades. While I do agree with some of the other reviewers that this one felt a little rushed, and perhaps was published in an abridged form, it is still quality writing and satisfying action-adventure reading.    In The Last Colony, John Perry and Jane Sagan (the main character of Old Man's War and one of the major characters of The Ghost Brigades, respectively) are recruited out of retirement to lead a \\"seed\\" colony. A seed colony is a 2500-person strong, government-authorized colony (as opposed to illegal, \\"wildcat\\" colonies) whose primary mission is to settle on a new planet, survive the first few years there, and prepare the way for the next, much larger wave of colonists. Previously, the Colonial Union only accepted colonists from Mother Earth, in the rationale that Earth was overpopulated, while the various colonized worlds still needed the colonists to stick around and breed more of their kind. However, many of the older colonized worlds wanted to be allowed to colonize, and finally, their wish is granted, albeit in the form of a seed colony in which ten separate colonized worlds are represented. It seems like a recipe for discord and disaster, and Perry and Sagan are (somewhat unwittingly) recruited to lead it.    The colony is established, but unbeknownst to most of the colonists, they are merely pawns in a huge interstellar political chess match. To find out more, you'll have to read it. I felt that this book was much lighter on the action sequences and the science-fiction gadgetry and technology, but deeper in the character dynamics and plot machinations. Overall, I was pleased with it, and certainly hope Scalzi's next batch of books are as good as his first trilogy.
B000J10ERO|3.0|Straight to the point, Superman as Lois Lane's \\"baby daddy\\" not good. Just not right, as a superhero, probably the best of all time, he really should not have any other weaknesses, and this is a weakness. Directors and producers constantly looking for a happy ending, that really was not there. That's one reason it did not destroy box ofice numbers like it should have, they should have killed Spideran and Batman numbers. I like Brandon Routh as Supernman, it just like Christopher Reeves once said, \\"If they make any more Superman sequels in the future, they should cast a new face as Superman just like they did for me.\\" Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther is good. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, I did not agree with, don't get me wrong Kate is beautiful, but she has become skin and bones since \\"Blue Crush\\". Lois Lane engaged and a mother worked for me, just did not like Superman as the father, it causes more complicated questions to be answered. THIS IS WHY THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL IN 2009 ! Other than that the movie was truly great, regardless of what some people think, the action sequences were great and Lex getting the best of him again but falling short again. True to Superman form.
B000003493|4.0|This is one of several albums (LPs, CDs, and Box Sets alike) to bear the title of \\"Nuggets.\\" Specifically, it's the first entry in a three part series, originally released by Rhino Records in the mid-80s. The series was intended to be a companion to Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968, a double LP released by Elektra Records in 1972. Rhino would go on to release a four-disc box set of the same title (which is probably the most famous member of the Nuggets family) in the mid 90s. The box set included all of the tracks from the 1972 LP.    The purpose of Nuggets (the LP, the series, and the box set) was to reissue undeservedly little-known, forgotten, or just plain obscure rock 'n' roll tunes from the mid '60s, and this is achieved with remarkable success. In fact, the box set (especially the 27 tracks that made up the original LP) is pretty much essential listening for anyone who even remotely cares about rock music. The kind of music found on a Nuggets album is wild, exuberant, and (usually) brilliant, a pocket-sized summation of just why rock 'n' roll is so great. Although not as stunnignly good as the box set, this disc is also an excellent listen for several reasons.    For one thing, it has 12 tracks in common with the box set (and 6 with the original LP), making it an excellent introduction to the Nuggets sound for someone who doesn't want to shell out the cash for a four disc set. They're also stunning songs in their own right: The Standells' \\"Dirty Water\\" is a strutting slice of bluesy proto-punk with a mean little guitar lick and some snarling vocals, while The Chocolate Watchband's \\"Let's Talk About Girls\\" threatens to outdo the bloody mindedness and raw sexuality of the 'Stones. The Count Five's \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" is a ridiculously catchy two-chord smasher that brilliantly apes the Yardbirds (and sets the template for hundreds of other garage bands to follow), while the Seeds sound brilliantly bizarre on \\"Pushin' Too Hard\\" and \\"Can't Seem To Make You Mine.\\" The Amboy Dukes bridge the gap between psychedelia and hard rock on \\"Journey To the Center of the Mind\\" (which features a young Ted Nugent slaughtering his guitar!), and the Knickerbockers craft the ultimate Beatles soundalike with \\"Lies.\\" Of the six tracks that aren't on the box set, the Easybeats' \\"Friday On My Mind\\" and the Troggs' ubiquitous classic \\"Wild Thing\\" are strong highlights.    Still, this isn't a perfect disc. Since you really should have the box set in your collection, twelve of these tracks are redundant. Also, the inclusion of two songs by the Monkees (\\"Valleri\\" and \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\\") is a little odd, as those songs are widely available elsewhere. They're not bad songs, though. A lot of these songs don't really measure up to the standards set by the box set- the 6 songs that don't overlap with the set (yes, even \\"Wild Thing\\" and \\"Friday On My Mind\\") pale in comparison to the other 12, and drag down the pleasure factor by a bit. They're not terrible songs, of course, just not quite as good as the others.    Still, for someone just getting accquainted with the world of Nuggets, this is an excellent first purchase. Just remember to come back for more!
076790382X|2.0|I read through about the first third of this offering by Bill Bryson and found I simply could not get into it. Written in the spirit of Dave Barry, Mary Roach and maybe Erma Bombeck, it is intended to draw humor from the little idiosyncrasies of daily American life as seen by an expatriot returned from years in the U.K.<br /><br />Where I find Dave Barry's turns of phrase highly amusing I tend to find Bill's commentary more rankling. Each article highlights some aspect of American life that I find less than satisfying and the commentary, though trying to be amusing, simply comes off as frustrating.
B000002J0P|5.0|As a document of the post Summer of Love hippie scene, this album is indispensible; that era's unfettered, doomed optimism and community spirit are trapped in these grooves forever. But if CSN's debut was nothing more than a musical time capsule, I wouldn't be giving it five stars. In fact, what's most impressive about this record is how timeless it is- 38 years after its release, this is still a gorgeous collection of songs, brimming with sweet, sunny, evocative music and genuine emotional resonance. The classic \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" is a stunning case-in-point: Although it's an extended medley, the song doesn't feature any of the pretentions usually associated with such music. Instead, it's a scintillating collection of beautiful melodies and sky-scraping harmonies, a lush, dreamy masterpiece that deftly combines folk and rock with light touches of psychedelia (just listen to that second section!). The lyrics are pure heartfelt poetry, full of lines that are uncanny in their identifiabilty. The result is one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and a marvelous album opener. After that, we get classics like the icy, spine-tingling folk of \\"Guenevere\\" and \\"Lady of the Island,\\" as well as the pained beauty of \\"Helplessly Hoping.\\" \\"Long Time Gone,\\" \\"You Don't Have To Cry\\" and the apocalyptic \\"Wooden Ships\\" demonstrate the group's knack for protest songs and social commentary. The latter, with its ethereal electric guitar line and the dark surrealism of its lyrics, is particularly effective. \\"Marrakesh Express\\" is a playful, upbeat treat with some great lyrical imagery, and \\"Pre-Road Downs\\" is an infectious slice of what may as well be called post-psychedelia. All in all, this is one of the very best albums of the 60s, and a great addition to any and all collections of rock or pop.
1591841666|3.0|This book was a quick read, but I didn't find that it contained much substance.  I would recommend Max Lucado's 'A Cure for the Common Life.'  It does have a Christian basis, but I felt the book was much better than 'The Dip.'

0375423877|4.0|This is almost a genre unto itself.  Clearly there is a detective agency and a detective who solves cases.  But these are unlike others in the usual mystery repertoire.  Although the cases at hand are serious both to the clients and to the detective, the telling of them is light and delightful, short and sweet and a little bit quirky. :-)   BUT clearly there is ingenuity at work.  Try it; you'll like it!
0399230033|5.0|We received this book as a gift after our daughter's birth, and now that she's ten months old, it's her absolute favorite.  She actually goes to her book basket, digs through the all of the books to find this one, and then brings it to us to read to her.  The best part is that because the narrative is told through the pictures instead of through words, it's a different book when I read it to her than when her father, grandmother, etc. does.  I'm sure that as she gets older, we'll be able to modify our reading of Good Night, Gorilla to suit her age, pointing out different things about the story than interest her now.  This book is destined to be a classic!
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is a really funny old movie!  A great mystery/comedy that is more about the individual, funny personalities of the detectives mixing with the others then the mystery it's self.  The totally different types of detectives makes this such a funny movie.
032147404X|4.0|A while back I bought a copy of this book and just when I was in the last paragraph it grew legs and walked away at work. Liking the book so much, I ordered another copy. It's very simple and to the point.
B000002UAU|5.0|It is impossible to adequately explain to someone not around forty years ago when this album was released its importance and what it meant to so many of us. The Beatles were at their height. In the U. S., it was before the assassinations of Malcolm X, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King when all the world seemed young and everything was possible. It was more than just world class music, it was a social and cultural phenomenon. There had never been anything just quite like it before. It helped define the 1960's.<br /><br />The music of course is of one cloth as each song seques into the next one. No song stands out above another although my favorite has always been \\"When I'm Sixy-four.\\" It now has a poignancy that we never dreamed of in those our salad days since neither George Harrison or John Lennon lived to see sixty-four. Then there was a whole generation of men, many who grew up with the Beatles, who perished in the first wave of AIDS.<br /><br />Besides the marvelous music, there is of course the artwork for the album/CD. According to the liner notes by Peter Blake, he asked the Beatles for a list of people they would want at an imaginary concert. John initially wanted to include Jesus, Ghandi and Hitler but eventually left all three off the list because of the controversy in the U. S. over his recent comment about Jesus. Some of the people who made the list were Marlene Dietrich, Shirley Temple, Marlon Brando, Bob Dylan, Dylan Thomas, Edgar Allen Poe, Tony Curtis, William Burroughs, Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Johnny Weismuller, Stephen Crane, Albert Einstein, and Mae West (who refused at first but eventually agreed to be included in the life-size collage.)<br /><br />It is impossible to write about either popular music or the popular culture of the last half of the twentieth century without a discussion of this CD. It should be placed in a time capsule.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|While I'm certainly not a fan of the Tomb Raider video games (because they're horribly designed and endlessly frustrating) I couldn't believe my sees at the sight of a really good Tomb Raider action movie.  Sure, some of the lines were pretty silly and cheesy, and the action scenes were pretty predictable because you KNEW Lara would always escape danger is highly unbelievable ways.  It doesn't matter though, because I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this film.  Good watch.
0345448898|1.0|The first book in this series was very well written and engaging.  However the second book, seemed to muddle the difference between good vs. evil, and left me feeling disappointed and uneasy.  I was unable to complete the third book.  It became clear that Mr. Pullman was expressing extremely anti-religious beliefs.  The book simply contained too much blasphemy for me to continue.  This book is definitly not appropriate for children.  If you are a Christian parent looking for good science fiction/fantasy books for your child, stick w/ Narnia or Harry Potter.  Both of these series draw a definite line btwn good & evil and the hero is on the side of good.

1400063515|5.0|There are many long reviews already here, so I will provide a more concise perspective. I usually drive into work (though I know it's not a very \\"green\\" thing to do) because I have to commute into lower Manhattan and the decrepit 1970s cars of the Metro North system are truly an insult, and the subways are worse. Then I bought this book and I loved it. I bought a monthly pass on Metro North just to read it. And I've been riding the trains since. So you see, The Black Swan has already made a positive contribution to the environment. You must read it!

B000MR1V22|1.0|I downloaded this as part of the introduction of the Amazon/TiVo partnership of on demand movies for my TiVo from Amazon. Well, the service needs a LOT of work. It downloaded OK but I could not fast forward or pause the movie without it becoming garbled and unplayable. Ultimately, I gave up and deleted it. Your best course of movies in your home is to rent them on DVD or record them on your DVR for later play back. Even if this service worked, there are too many restrictions such as only 24 hours to play it and the time it takes to download it.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|\\"The Day After\\" was one of a series of films made in the 1980's. Of these, only \\"Testament\\" could be called a success. The films were part of a massive campaign by the USSR and Western leftists to keep ground-based nukes from Western Europe.  The CSPI (Center for Science in the Public Interest), a \\"disinterested\\" group that hilariously declared itself non-partisan, led the charge with graphic descriptions of nuclear winter or worse. After deployment and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, the subject was never broached. The hype was huge - psychiatrists and child psychologists were ready to help grieving students who happened to watch the show, the papers played it big, the media gave it all the free publicity you could want...and it was still an artistic blunder.    Besidess blocking the weapons (not necessarily a bad thing), the movie had two purposes:  (1) Visualzie the horrible affects of a nuclear war and just as important (2) make the Soviet Empire and the West morally equivalent - no good or bad guys - just \\"big guys\\" and \\"little guys\\"  I'd expected a powerful, thought-provoking show but instead got a disaster on all fronts (artistic, political and military).  The dialogue was possibly the most stilted and amateurish ever presented on screen.  It sounded like a high school play at times - awkward & hesitant.  Husbands and wives spoke like strangers, family talk was from Ozzie & Harriet, a 6th grader asks, \\"Daddy, whut's radiation?\\"  Folks on the brink of starvation resist the only method for replanting crops. No one has heard of an EMP and (you have to smile) when it hits, EVERYONE stays in their car trying to start the engines, oblivious to the zillion others around them with the same problem. Politically it's a phony Kumbaya Moment. In crimson Kansas folks greet the Soviet closure of West Berlin with a shrug - no expressions of outrage.  At the end, the President (read Reagan) gives a ridiculously upbeat speech - we have not surrendedred and he invokes God and patriotism.  All the while, victims moan and the camera shows devastation.  Apparently the purpose of the awful dialogue was to make folks sound like \\"simple folk\\" who loved mom, pop, God & corn.  Although set in the 80's, the viewer for some reason kept getting glimpses of what looked like film from the 1950's.     It is the acting that really \\"bombed\\". Poor Jason Robards comes in for the most criticism.  Unlike everyone else, his clothes stay clean and fresh.  He appears drunk or doped during the entire film, stumbling and slurring his way through the most unlikely of circumstances. It's as if the writers tried to substitue incoherence and mangled steps for serious lines.  Amy Madigan is present as a pregnant woman and whines as usual. Steve Gutenburg is a student with embarrasingly poor lines.  John Lithgow plays an exasperated know-it-all. The extras hired to portray victims never spoke a word - did the bomb suddenly remove the gift of speech?  Emotions were surface - you feel as if the actor could just as easily cry as laugh.  The chemistry between the romantic couples was about as heated as a male model and a beauty queen.    This is too bad because the few good scenes were very affective - the harried soldiers, the moment the bomb hit, the panorama of utter destruction and that final tragedy when student met the daughter and both had lost their hair.  For obvious reasons, the start of the war was obscure - after all, who cares about blame in such a catastrophe?  Who attacked first, who initiated the first nuclear strike, why did the USSR block Berlin in the first place?  I kept waiting to see the rest of the world but that would have entailed creativity and another story.  In this case the writers were inadvertently correct to focus on this locality.  The outside world is a mysterious unknown, like Medieval times when one only knew the village in which they were born and died.  The film was promptly criticized by Sagan (CSPI) as too \\"optimistic\\".You can't please all the folks all the time, I guess.  My grade - C-
B000EULJLU|5.0|I purchased this CD the day after it was released, so why take so long to review?  For starters, this album was NOT what I expected, though, with Maynard & Company and their creativity, I should've known better than to have any expectations other than greatness.  Truthfully, for the first few days I had to force myself to listen to the album; my brain didn't know how to process the music.  I slowly found myself skipping to tracks like \\"The Pot\\", fully engrossed in trying to figure out the lyrics and because something hit a chord in my psyche.  Interestingly enough, my favorite songs on this album have changed several times, with my current and favorite for the longest time being the behemoth title track.  It evolves so impressively that by the time the track is over a whopping twelve minutes later, I'm ready to listen to it again.  Most interestingly, of all the 13,000+ CDs we own (including all the other Tool albums), this album has remained in our car's CD player the longest, and is STILL there in mp3 form fourteen months later.  Yes, I do often skip tracks 7, 11 and sometimes 9 because they don't have a lot of musical meat on them, but that's what the skip button is for... The remaining tracks are powerful enough to carry this album to one of my all-time favorites.  Note: Be sure and purchase the physical CD if only to check out the fantastic (and Grammy-winning) packaging artwork.  An amazing album, even if it IS an acquired taste.
0060558121|3.0|American Gods, a technically brilliant but flawed novel, sets up the Old World gods as alive in America but not necessarily well.  From the great glory they knew at their height in Europe and Asia, they have now become grifters, con men, laborers and clerks.  The story takes place amidst a brewing conflict with the \\"new gods\\" of computers, credit cards, and the like.<br /><br />Shadow, an ex-con who committed a crime to cover for his now-dead wife, is taken under the wing of a corrupt Odin to serve as muscle in the upcoming conflict.  Shadow and Odin (among others, including Anansi of Anansi Boys) embark on a series of encounters, journeys, stories, and strongly hinted mysteries.  Shadow meets such diverse mythological figures as Ibis and Johnny Appleseed, in a miasmic journey across America.<br />But American Gods, operating with only a minimal story, lacks any sense of importance or urgency.  This is reflected by Shadow himself.  He is strangely passive, having almost no emotional affect or real reaction to events.  To the extent that this is purposeful Gaiman offers only hints as to Shadow's true nature, which might provide some explanation.  But real answers never come, and the outcome is unsatisfactory.<br /><br />Gaiman's craftsmanship, imagination, ear for dialogue and sheer ability should have carried out this premise - for that matter, any premise - better than it did.
B00005JPKE|4.0|In the bonus materials from the DVD, Director Clint Eastwood mentions that he originally set out to make Flags of our Fathers as a single film, but that during research about the Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima, he realized their story was a compelling one and decided to make a separate film about it. This \\"afterthought\\" film is actually much more interesting and better-told then Flags.
0316067598|4.0|Excellent book - A must read for military minded men and women thinking about serving this great nation and getting seriously in harms way to fight for freedom. The SEALS are the premier elite fighting force in America, because they will literally go anywhere on the earth to fight. They simply don't know the meaning of the word quit, or give up, even when their lives are mere seconds from eternity.   Here is the story of Marcus Lutrell and SEAL Team 10 as they go into the mountains of Afghanistan to find and eliminate a terrorist leader. You have never seen teamwork like this..ever. The job continues today...

0618680004|4.0|Most of Richard Dawkins' views seem to stem from scientific background and religious research. I was cautioned about the legitimacy of Dawkins' philosphical views but, in the book, he makes a significant number of references in support of his assertions. Most importantly, Mr Dawkins is a passionate atheist. His passion matches the passion of the evangelicals he must regularly face.     If you're considering atheism or just sitting on the fence of agnosticism, \\"The God Delusion\\" will confront your beliefs and present you with strong arguments for atheism.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I like to applaud an artist that isn't afraid to create her own path and clamor for musical independance instead of following the trend of reproducing a radio friendly album over and over.  With the publicized offer to trade songs for cash ( that Ms Clarkson quickly refused ) the path this closely resembles is that of Pink and as I believed Pink had the best pop album of last year so far I believe Kelly has the best pop album of this year.  Ill be the first to admit I hate American Idol and it is one of the many reasons that I refuse to listen to public radio but this album deserves a listen. OF the tracks I have listened to most, I believe that Haunted and Irvine are the sign of whats to come from this talented artist.  The only thing I haven't seen in reviews is how closely Kelly Clarkson's voice resembles Paula Cole and to be mentioned in the same breath as Paula Cole is one of the best compliments I can give a modern day pop star.
B000H305U0|3.0|I bought this CD mainly for the Sexyback song and thought the other songs on the CD would have a similar beat/feel to them.  I was unpleasantly surprised to find that I really only like 3 songs on the entire CD. Many of them do not sound at all like Sexyback, some of them do not even sound like Justin Timberlake, and some sound like rap-type music.  It's okay - but if you are expecting a similar sound/feel for the songs, it is not there.

B0007DAZW8|5.0|This album was difficult for me to get into completely until I saw Daft Punk live on their \\"ALIVE\\" tour.  They put on a full show, complete with a story and amazing lighting and props that are almost Vegas-like.  The Daft Punk duo are dressed as robot aliens performing on stage inside a pyramid-like spaceship poking through a mesh of triangles.  They start the show introducing themselves to Earth, by repeating the words \\"Human\\" and \\"Robot\\" in succession, until \\"Robot\\" takes over compelely, and they launch into \\"Robot Rock\\".  They've set the theme that they are robot aliens from outer space trying to understand \\"humans\\".  They progress through many of the songs on the album, plus a lot of their older material, much of it \\"mashed-up\\" together, and each of the songs has a context in this theme.  The song \\"Technologic\\" is about how the robot aliens understand our consumer culture.  \\"Steam Machine\\" about the robot aliens understand our \\"industrial culture\\", and of course \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" speaks for itself.  They end the set with \\"Human After All\\", as a summary of the robots understanding the human, and perhaps desiring to be part of it.  The encore set Picks up on repeating \\"human\\" over and over, and then adding the word \\"together\\" to it, to end on an ecumenical (in the secluar sense) note.  Before the show, I had the same critiques of the album that people list here, but after you see the show, (with a very flexible mind), you will \\"get\\" the album, and love it as one of their classics.  Please, people who've seen the \\"Alive\\" show, comment on this theme, and tell me if you agree, or if you have a different interpretation.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is truly an epic and groundbreaking documentary on the earth and all it's wonders.  The dvd is even better than the Discovery Channel presentation due to David Attenbourough's narration, the added footage in each episode and the 5th dvd that shows our environmental impact and how we may be able to reverse or at leat stop the damage.<br /><br />A must have for any nature and/or environmental enthusiest!
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Review of the 2-disc full-screen edition:     I really enjoyed this movie as the trio of main characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione)continue to mature and grow in their 3rd year at Hogwart's.  Sirius Black ( a great Gary Oldman) has escaped Azkaban and is on his way to \\"kill\\" Harry at Hogwart's.  New characters are introduced, including Professor Lupin (played by David Thewlis) who plays a mentorship role to Harry.  The movie is darker than the first 2 movies, as the storyline continues to follow the progress of the characters at Hogwart's.  I enjoyed the introduction of the Hipogriff as a new creature and the deadly Dementors'(guards of the Prison of Azkaban).    Disc 1:  * movie  * Cast/Crew : which actor plays which character  * Trailers for the first 3 movies    Disc 2:  * Divination    - Trelawneys Crystal Ball ( 5 unfinished scenes)    - Creating the Vision: An interview with JK Rowling and Director Alfonso about the transition from book to movie.  The interview is done by a guy and one of the shruken heads that were in the movie.  Pretty funny.    - Head To Shrunken Head: Interviews with the cast and crew. (43 min)  * Great Hall    - \\"Catch Scabbers\\" the rat game    - Choir Practice: song lyrics with scenes from the movie    - \\"Quest of Sir Cadogan\\" game  * Tour Honey dukes: tour of the candy store  (boring to me)  * Hogwart's Grounds    - Hagrid's Hut:  Has \\"Care of Magical Creatures\\" which shows the different training of the various animals in the 3rd movie.  In \\"Conjuring a Scene\\", it shows how the Dementors came to film, and it showed how the scene of the Knightbus was filmed which was interesting.  This section also has what is on the DVD-Rom for your computer.  * Defense Against the Dark Arts:  has a tour of Lupin's classroom and magic you may have scene in the movie.    Overall a great movie, and the 2 disc edition has many great extra's on it for those of us who like them!
B000F7BPLG|5.0|\\"Flag in Exile\\" is the fifth book in a wonderful space opera series set some three thousand years in the future and featuring David Weber's best fictional heroine, \\"Honor Harrington.\\"<br /><br />These books are best read in sequence and I strongly recommend that you start with \\"On Basilisk Station\\" which is the first one.<br /><br />The Honor Harrington stories are replete with parallels to the time of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. In particular, the Royal Manticoran Navy in which the heroine is a captain is clearly based on the Royal Navy at the time of Nelson. (In this book she finds herself seconded to serve as an admiral in the navy of Manticore's ally, Grayson.)<br /><br />The technology of space travel and naval warfare in the Honor Harrington stories has been written so as to impose tactical and strategic constraints on space navy officers similar to those which the technology of fighting sail imposed on wet navy officers two hundred years ago. Similarly the galactic situation in the novels contains many similarities to the strategic and political situation in European history in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<br /><br />This seems to be quite deliberate: many thinly veiled (and amusing) hints in the books indicate that they are to some extent a tribute to C.S. Forester, while the main heroine of the books, Honor Harrington, appears to owe more than just her initials to C.S. Forester's character \\"Horatio Hornblower.\\"<br /><br />In the earlier book, \\"The Short Victorious War\\", Honor's home nation of Manticore, and their allies, were attacked by the People's Republic of Haven or \\"Peeps\\" - an agressive superpower which has been gradually conquering the small nations on its borders in bitesize chunks.<br /><br />Following a coup in the People's Republic after their first round of attacks were not successful, Haven is now run by a \\"Committee of Public Safety\\" headed by one Rob S. Pierre, which has imposed a reign of terror. However, the new Peep government is just as committed to the war as the old one was.<br /><br />Weber clearly means the reader to understand that Haven represents Revolutionary France. Early in this book, the Grayson High Admiral prsents a report to his head of state which concludes that \\"this is going to be a long, long war unless one side or the other completely screws up\\" and \\"this war isn't about territory any more. It's become a war for survival; someone - either the Kingdom of Manticore and its allies, including us, or the People's Republic of Haven - is going down this time, Your Grace. For good.\\"<br /><br />At the start of this book, Honor Harrington has been relieved of command of HMS Nike and put on half-pay after the fighting two controversial duels. So she has returned to Grayson where she is now a \\"steadholder\\" e.g. one of the most powerful people on the planet.<br /><br />Up to this point in the series, Weber has appeared to show disdain and even contempt for politicians, but now that his heroine has become one, she has to think through the decisions she takes from that very different perspective. From this book onwards in the series, the way that political needs affect military objectives begins to be considered in a far more realistic and less oversimplified way.<br /><br />However, Grayson doesn't just need Honor as a political leader: they desperately need her naval experience, so they ask her to take command of a squadron of superdreadnaughts.<br /><br />More traditionalist elements on Grayson are horrified at the idea of a female steadholder, so Honor has to deal with some very nasty tactics, including a horrible act of terorism. Honor has to defend against  enemies both within and without.<br /><br />There is an author's note in my copy (September 1995) explaining that the original manuscript was completed in October 1994. Between the time it was finished and the novel's publication came the Oaklahoma bombing, an act Weber describes as \\"even more despicable than my fictional villains.\\" He adds \\"That we cannot allow those actus to go unpunished or extend to those who commit them any shred of respect, whatever the \\"cause\\" which motivated them, is a lesson the civilised human community must teach itself.\\"<br /><br />At the time of writing there are thirteen full length novels and four short story collections in the \\"Honorverse\\" as the fictional galaxy in which these stories are set is sometimes known. The main series which tells the story of Honor Harrington herself currently runs to eleven novels; in order these are<br /><br />On Basilisk Station<br />The Honor of the Queen<br />The Short Victorious War<br />Field of Dishonour<br />Flag in Exile<br />Honor among Enemies<br />In Enemy Hands<br />Echoes of Honor<br />Ashes of Victory<br />War of Honor<br />At All Costs<br /><br />The four collections of short stories set in the same universe, not all of which feature Honor Harrington herself, are<br /><br />More Than Honor<br />Worlds of Honor<br />Worlds of Honor III: Changer of Worlds<br />Worlds of Honor IV: The Service of the Sword<br /><br />The two spin-off novels are \\"Crown of Slaves\\" (with Eric Flint) which is a story of espionage and intrigue featuring a number of characters first introduced in earlier Honor Harrington novels or \\"Honorverse\\" short story collections, and \\"The Shadow of Saganami\\" which is a kind of \\"next generation\\" novel featuring a number of younger officers in the navies of Manticore and her ally Grayson.<br /><br />For amusement, if you want to try to look for the parallels to nations and individuals from the French revolutionary period and the Hornblower books, one possible translation would be:<br /><br />People's Republic of Haven = France<br />Star Kingdom of Manticore = Great Britain<br />Gryphon = Scotland<br />Grayson = Portugal<br /><br />Prime Minister Alan Summervale = Pitt the Younger<br />Hamish Alexander, later Earl White Haven = Admiral Edward Pellew<br />Honor Harrington = Horatio Hornblower<br />Alistair McKeon = William Bush<br /><br />Crown loyalists and Centrists = Tory supporters of Pitt<br />Conservative Association = isolationist/hardline High Tories<br />New Kiev Liberals = Whig Oligarchists<br />Progressives and traditional liberals = Whig radicals<br /><br />Legislaturist former rulers of Haven = Bourbon monarchy and French nobles<br />Rob S.

0151013047|2.0|One of the nagging questions of 9/11 is why successful, westernized, middle-class Saudis would fly airliners into buildings in support of a program that seeks to restore the caliphate.  Ostensibly, The Reluctant Fundamentalist seeks to answer that question. It follows a young Pakistani from his admission to Princeton through his doomed love affair with an American woman and his career with a blue chip Wall Street firm to 9/11 and his eventual collaboration with unidentified elements of the Pakistani underground. But instead of penetrating and revealing the difficult terrain of a soul caught in deep contradiction, Mosin Hamid defaults to a superficial litany of anti-Americanisms masquerading as character development. The story-telling structure of the novel doesn't help much, forcing the antagonist into more and more supercilious positions. The one thing we in the West can be sure of is the difficulty of every decision made by flesh-and-blood Muslims caught between current realities and a life lived with dignity. Unfortunately, the political clich&eacute;s of The Reluctant Fundamentalist bring us no closer to understanding the heart wrenching nature of those decisions or the small hope of dignity they provide.
B000OLGCHA|1.0|Now, before people go off on me about my review of not only the music presented on the CD but the full score as well I am going to say some things first.  I love John Williams and the fact that this isn't Williams has no bearing on the quality of the score.  The gentlemen who composed the music for the fourth film did a fine job taking music pioneered by Williams and adding his own spin to it.  So, this has nothing to do with hatred towards these composers not being Williams.    The music is good, but it's not Harry Potter.  It gets one star because, well it doesn't belong on this film at all.  The brilliant theme written by John Williams is almost entirely absent, showing up with any effect in the start of the film and then pretty much never after that, at least nowhere of consequence.  Why?  Why has the main theme been left behind?  Give me a logical explanation why any composer or director would allow someone to completely get rid of the defining theme of the entire series?  One logical reason.  There isn't any.  This composer has taken it upon himself, despite inadequate experience to completely rewrite the entire score, with little bits here and there to attempt to please those of us who actually enjoyed the previous soundtracks quite well.  The composer also has no concept of space and the use of silence in a composition.  More than one occasion on the score during the movie there were parts where the music completely did not fit in.  It felt like the composer wrote the music for a different scene.  This shows a lack of understanding of music theory in terms of films and that is unacceptable for a series as massive as this.    Now, about the music itself.  If you didn't know it was Harry Potter and you heard it you probably would think, \\"well this is pretty good\\".  Why?  Because it is actually good music.  The new themes are rather energetic--in places--and powerful.  It's strong music.  But, it's not Harry Potter.  It's not.  Doesn't sound like Harry Potter,doesn't play like Harry Potter, and never will be Harry Potter.  It is far too American sounding to be Harry Potter.  Yes, there is such a thing as American style compositions.  You've probably seen enough American films to understand what I mean by this.    So, I will say this:  If you don't care that it's basically a bastardization of the amazing music presented before in that it doesn't bare almost any resemblance in most instances to the foundations, then by all means buy this.  It's good music, just not the music you'd be expecting from a Harry Potter score.  Otherwise, don't buy it.  Skip this one and pray that the executive producers or somebody fires this guy or makes him write a better score for the next film, provided he will be sticking around.  With the shakiness of the film as it is, this isn't guaranteed in any way.

B000006OBQ|5.0|There are always certain movies, books and in this case albums whose ecellence is hard to describe in words. Such is the case for me with \\"Sinatra At The Sands\\". Many times have I tried to write a concise, detailed review of how wonderful this 1966 concert album is, but I always wind up with a stinging case of writer's block.<br /><br />For \\"Sinatra: At The Sands\\" is quite simply, the best live album I've ever heard, as well as one of the best in general. The energy, the performances, the audience - everything clicks so perfectly here that it's almost scary.<br /><br />Recorded during his early 1966 engagement at the famed Sands Hotel & Casino with Count Basie and his orchestra, this is Sinatra in top form. He is loose, relaxed and clearly having fun, but at the same time he is focused, professional and dangerous. His voice is still close to the condition it was at his peak, so he sounds fantastic on each song, his trademark breath control and diction skills in pristine condition.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the energy level on this album is quite high. Becasue Count Basie and his orchestra were accustomed to the Big Band, swing-style music, most of the crooner-type songs Frank is associated is tossed aside for rougher, heavier, more uptempo numbers. This means typically faster numbers such as  \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" (arguably the definitive version), \\"Luck Be A Lady\\", \\"My Kind Of Town\\" and \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\" more pumped up and lively than originally conceived in the studio, while typically reserved numbers such as \\"Come Fly With Me\\", \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" and \\"Where Or When\\" are reworked (with excellent results) to work within the swingin' mood of the rest of the set.<br /><br />The rare times Frank cools things down a bit for a slower tune is welcome. \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" is playful and sincere, his cover of Tony Bennett's \\"The Shadow Of Your Smile\\" is lovely, while \\"One For My Baby (And One More For The Road) and \\"Angel Eyes\\" are typically heartwrenching, and \\"Don't Worry 'Bout Me\\" also works quite well. \\"The September Of My Years\\" and \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\" don't quite succeed at recapturing the emotion poignancy of their studio precursors, but go over well enough.<br /><br />Basie also takes on a few instrumentals while Frank catches his breath, and they are great to hear. Basie ranks right up there with Ellington and Satchmo as one of the premiere jazz bandleaders of his time. The great Quincy Jones, still fairly young and new here, does a greayt job conducting Basie's fabulous band.<br /><br />Frank's monologues are hilarious, if a bit off color and sometimes just plain cruel.<br /><br />The sound quality on this remastered edition is excellent, as is the liner notes by Stan Cornyn, which perfectly detail the magic of seeing Sinatra in concert (something I never had the chance to do). This is a classic recording that I all Sinatra fans, as well as music fans in general, should not go without.Bout Me\\" also works quite well. \\"The September Of My Years\\" and \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\" don't quite succeed at recapturing the emotion poignancy of their studio precursors, but go over well enough.

0694518018|1.0|There are a number of problems with this audio tape. They are:    a) Content is very outdated. The original copyright was 1973 while the latest, on the audio tape box, was 1996. Despite this 23 year difference there are no modifications for almost anything that has happened in terms of either the financial markets, historically, since that time nor (more importantly) have their been any additiions for the large number of financial instruments that permit portfolio diversification (i.e., mutual funds are barely discussed, ETFs, indexing and foreign stocks and finacial instruments are not even mentioned). How can it be 2007 with not a mention (or bare mention of any of these?    b) No discussion of portfolio theory and the importance of diversification.    c) Stock analysis is primarily geared to manufacturing company. For example, the analysis on the importance of book value is geared exclusively to manufacturing and inventory carrying businesses. The concept of intellectual property is not even mentioned in passing.     d) No discussion of economic or financial market history since early 1970s. In addition, no mention of financial markets outside the U.S. (or world outside of the US for that matter).    e) Very limited financial discussion on financial ratios and the few there are are limited to manufacturing companies.     f) Emphasis in stock analysis is primarily on Dow Jows Industrials. Not much of a world outside that exists in terms of book's discussion.    One can obtain much more useful information on stock analysis and investment in almost any introductory level undergraduate text on finance.     There are two reasons it is to be given even one star. One is that it discusses some stock market history from WWI period to early 1970s. The second is that it was \\"cutting edge\\" for many years since it was first published. It thus provides some historical perspective on stock analysis (i.e., especially the analysis on manufacturing companies, almost no technologyor intellectual property discussed, etc.). This alone is worth the one star as it will make one think how much of what is currently \\"mainstream\\" or \\"cutting edge\\" in stock/finance investment will become just as obsolete in another 30 years.
B00005R23S|5.0|If you want to see what a rock legend looks like, it is imperative that you watch this, possibly more than once.<br /><br />A true rock legend is someone who actually transcends the genre.  This DVD captures a man in his element, in his time, doing what he was put on this earth to do, without shame and without remorse.  To put it simply, he plays and sings every note as if it were his last.  He seizes the day and lays bare his passions.  This is more than a rock concert, it is a lesson on how to live your life.<br /><br />I'm not your typical gushing fan.  I'm not going to say \\"All Hail Bruce Spingsteen, he's my hero!\\".  Frankly, I don't know the man and I don't believe in hero-worship.  But what I do know is that he understands his job and he does it very, very well.  He knows how to touch people, how to lift their spirits and get them to aspire to something better.  He speaks from his heart.  His show is, in many ways, a religious experience-with ONE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.  It is all-inclusive.  It's all there for the asking.  You don't have to be a certain type of person, or subscribe to a particular set of beliefs in order to be a part of this.  All you have to do is say \\"Yes, my heart is open.  I want to be happy.\\".  And, of course, you have to buy a ticket.  There's no mission without margin, after all.<br /><br />Bruce transcends the rock 'n' roll genre because he refuses to be defined by it.  He acknowledges that he is an entertainer, but yet he continues to approach his work in earnest, with a certain reverence that makes it more important than what it otherwise would be.  He understands that, above all, music is a means of communication.  It is a way to connect with your fellow man and find common ground.  He's not isolating himself from the audience.  He's not talking about things that others can't understand.  He's not trying to be vague and inscrutable.  He's an idealist, a humanist, and he is using his medium to push us all to higher ground.<br /><br />This DVD is about the church of the common man.  And I say \\"Amen, my brothers and sisters.  Throw off your shackles and be free!!!\\".  Sing it loud and sing it proud Bruce.  This DVD is what rock 'n' roll was meant to be.  It's emotional, it's raw, it's honest.  After watching this show I can honestly say that there is a force in the universe that moves us from within, and one of it's manifestations is Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band. The only question that remains is \\"Will you testify?\\".of the common man.  And I say \\"Amen, my brothers and sisters.  Throw off your shackles and be free!!!\\".

B000OQF6N6|1.0|\\" After seven years, the acclaimed Pumpkins have returned with Zeitgeist.  There are 3 versions of this CD, each one with one exclusive bonus track. It's a sham for long-time fans as well as for indie stores, because you can only get 2 of the versions at mass retailers (who are killing the music business). Ironic that a band like this, who built their career on the backs of the indies (Gish, anyone?), would lose all memory of their past. I openly encourage you not to buy this as a way of saying, \\"no thanks to your crappy marketing, you greedy bastards!\\" Thanks for listening.\\"      ~stinkweeds

B000LT2IHI|5.0|The problem with most ball toys is that if you get something stuck in it you can't ever get it out. And if you loose the balls the toy is unusable because no other balls will work with it. Not so with this! You can use just about any ball with it. It only comes with 3 balls, so right away we rounded up every ball in the house. We have about 20 of them going and it makes it so much fun. I'm not uptight about loosing these balls because I can go buy some ping pong balls if I need to.    As far as what the other reviewers said, it does take good coordination to put the balls in the mouth. My son got this for his 1st birthday and it took a day of practice to get good at putting the balls in. Smaller balls make it easier. If your child doesn't have good coordination then they may get frustrated. On the other hand it may improve their hand eye coordination.    It is really cute and plays cute music my son likes to dance to. My 3 year old is enjoying it too. Like I said it's the best ball toy we have had over the years. I have had to toss all the others out because you can not buy replacement balls for any of them, including the ball popper. But this one will last.    Update: Still love it but check out my review on the Fisher-Price Go Baby Go Sit-to-Crawl Polar Coaster
B000BFH2S2|4.0|If it weren't for the DVD, this rating would have been a 3 star.  The DVD is great, but the CD doesn't contain all the songs from the DVD, and the editing is terrible.  As an example, Michael introduces his #1 hit song as the next number, but another song follows!  Michael still sounds good as ever but given a second chance, I would probably purchase another of his CDs.
0140284095|5.0|If there's one thing Bertie Wooster should never do, it's make elaborate plans to bring estranged lovebirds back together.<br /><br />And he demonstrates just why in the second full-length Jeeves novel, a screwball disaster saga that sees Bertie confidently trying to fix people's lives. Of course, things go horribly wrong, and Wodehouse's arch, nutty look at what happens next is an absolute gem.<br /><br />When Aunt Dahlia summons him to Brinkley Court for a prizegiving, Bertie sends his newt-fancying friend Gussie instead -- especially since Gussie is enamoured of a girl staying there, the soppy Madeleine Bassett. But when Bertie hears that his cousin Angela has broken off her engagement to Tuppy Glossop -- and his aunt is in need of money -- he rushes down to assist all his relatives and pals by advising them to feign such sorrow that they're unable to eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately his plan falls through, and they manages to enrage the cook Anatole to the point where he storms out. Even worse, the prize-giving is a disaster and the wrong people end up engaged -- and pursued by homicidally angry exes. Only Jeeves' formidable brain can somehow save the day -- and Bertie's behind.<br /><br />P.G. Wodehouse made a pretty good living off of spoofing the upper crust of England, and the subtlely intlligent servants who bail them out. \\"Right Ho Jeeves\\" is a prime example of his writing -- some small mistakes rapidly balloon out into a crazy tangled mess, which only an intelligent manservant can rescue Bertie from.<br /><br />Much of the book's charm comes from its complex plot and series of disasters (such as Tuppy's homicidal rampage). And as usual, poor Bertie finds himself the object of young ladies' affections -- in this case, the appallingly goofy Madeleine thinks he's madly in love with her, when she's not rambling about fairies and bunnies. If there's a flaw, it's that Jeeves' final solution is a bit limp.<br /><br />But Wodehouse's writing is what really makes the book timeless. It's arch and wry, whether he's describing basic actions (\\"He leaped like a lamb in springtime\\"), or goofy dialogue (\\"But if you were a male newt, Madeline Bassett wouldn't look at you. Not with the eye of love, I mean\\").<br /><br />Jeeves and Bertie are the perfect comic team -- Bertie is proud, goofy, and not terribly bright, while the quiet Jeeves is a towering intellect with wry wit. And they're backed by a colourful, small cast of nutty aristocrats, schoolboys, sharp-tongued aunts and cousins, newt-fancying fish-faced men, and a girl who talks about how \\"every time a fairy sheds a tear, a wee bitty star is born.\\" Yech.<br /><br />\\"Right Ho Jeeves\\" is a hilarious, tangled farce of love, money, jealousy, dinner jackets and the mating rituals of newts. Absolutely priceless, from start to finish.describing basic actions (\\"He leaped like a lamb in springtime\\"), or goofy dialogue (\\"But if you were a male newt, Madeline Bassett wouldn't look at you.

6305736650|5.0|My wife walked into the room this weekend as I was watching the last scenes of CASABLANCA. 'Isn't it amazing how it lasts ...?', she observed of the Bogey-Bergman film that had moved me so. Indeed.<br /><br />She grew up with movies and Hollywood. I did not. I'm just catching up with cultural slice of Americana. There's a reason why CASABLANCA routinely appears in the top ten on lists of the greatest films ever made. 'Amazing how it's lasted.<br /><br />Bogey is superb in his wit and cynicism. As a newcomer to his films, I can't discern whether this accrues to Bogart as actor or, alternatively, to Bogart as beneficiary of superb writers. One thing for sure, after this film I'll have opportunity to form an opinion on that. CASABLANCA will *not* be my last Bogey film.<br /><br />Bergman in soft focus nearly makes the cameraman tremble. In a day when a woman's beauty had to be portrayed by means other than having her remove her clothes, Bergman comes across as irresistible, compelling, a woman worthy of waiting at a train station when everyone except you knows she won't show. Perhaps even the kind of woman who could entice a man like Bogey's Rick to abandon his practiced and protective cynicism. A woman, even, worthing sticking his neck out for. Rick, it is observed more than once, sticks his neck out for no one. It is one of the film's ironic and pivotal lies, for in fact he does.<br /><br />The casting, as many reviewers have observed, is arguably perfect. There is not a slow movement in this film, remarkable in a motion picture with very little of what we would today call 'action'.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is one for the ages. It's astonishing, as the good woman might have said, how it lasts.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I had saved this production of Emma for the last and was surprised at what I had missed when reading the book! This was so true to the book and so wonderfully done that I will watch it over and over I am sure.  It made the book come alive for me and sparked even more of Jane's meaning for me.  I could see how Emma felt through Gwyneth's wonderful portrayal.  I have never known Gweneth to be such a perfectionist as this movie truely reveals.  Thank you Gwyneth!
1593353006|4.0|Since I bought the MP3/CD edition, I have two things to comment on, the book itself and the cd production and format.    Goodkind reminds me of Herman Wouk, in both the good and not so good ways.  Reading Winds of War, by Wouk, I thought \\"I wish a better writer could have written this story,\\" as I read on avidly, page after page.  He had a way of telling you the same thing three times, or using clunky language.  But, then I realized: No other writer thought of this story, it didn't exist before Wouk created it.  And I couldn't stop reading the book.  Sometimes, a great storyteller is a great stylist, but the most important thing is that he or she tells a great, compelling story.  And Terry Goodkind does that.  Sometimes, he spends way too many pages telling us something he could have told us in one, but, ultimately, it is well worth the read.  It's a powerfully imagined world.    The MP3/CD format worked fine in Media Player and iTunes, once it was imported, but wouldn't play on the car CD player, nor directly off the CD on any other CD Player I tried.      Jim Bond, the narrator, does a consistently good job, giving distinctly different voices for each of the characters.  The sound quality is excellent.

0714834491|5.0|The effect of Alan's work cannot be measured. Many generations of graphic designers around the globe could consider, even if it sounds irreverent, that the influence of his thinking exceeds that of his graphic works. Or, maybe, they are a part of the same view. I had the joy of working with (for) him surrounded by the mystic of a company where innovative values, methodology, and productive manner form a paradigm largely imitated, but never equalled.    The Art of looking Sideways is a real haemorrhage of precious stories, quotes and unique images taken from mankind's (and his) visual memory and it is a treasure not to be lost. The delicious, nonconformist, iconoclastic words and style create labyrinths and paths that merge with the contents in such a way that interaction is continuous and surprising. Each page is a different world. A reveal. Every page could be the last and we would close the book with a smile. Yet there is always another, even more exciting than the previous one.  We have always dreamt of this book. It really seems this work has been around for ever, not just now. Being timeless, plural, and with an enormous and generous vision becomes a milestone of design and its long history. (Could it also be a milestone in the history of every book?). This book had to exist.    Years of hard work, search, analysis, compilations, trips, references, treasons, stories, memories, fantasies and thoughts give way to this book with the most delicate and human sense of humour. A book lightened by a smile of genuine wisdom, that of somebody who has learnt everything from deep practice and tells it with the asceticism and the greatness of great folks. He mentions every day stuff, things that less sagacious views would have missed. As a street encyclopaedia he is saying, as Macedonio Fernandez once said \\"not everything is wakefulness when eyes are opened.\\"  It is not a history of design, not even close. Nor an essay on semiotics. Nor a book on the theory of shapes. Nor arandom encyclopaedia. It is nothing that could be explained in editorial terms. It is a book for designers, scientists, housewives, doctors, astronauts, children and adults, a book for everybody. You just need an open mind and to sit back and experience the difference between seeing and looking. As Jeremy Myerson says on his review, \\"I think Alan wrote this book for me\\". I believe we all feel the same. We all sense we had something to do with this piece of work, something that involves us, because it involves everybody. And everything. We all believe it has been dedicated to us.  Alan said: \\"This book is about many things that I have never been taught\\".
B000Q6GXW2|4.0|We are really looking forward to the 300. My husband loves Frank Miller's work and Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead. I'm a history buff and will be interested in seeing the classic story of the Battle of Thermopylae retold.      About the Combos; IGN had no problems with the combo disk. IGN gave it 10 out of 10 in all categories and wondered \\"Is it possible to give a DVD a score of 300 out of 10?\\"  The combo disk is a great way to get into HD-DVD if you don't have a HD-Player yet and plan on eventually upgrading.    We have 6 HD/DVD combos with no problems, and it has been nice to have a \\"Regular\\" copy to play in the back room with a \\"Regular\\" dvd player or to take with us on a trip, or loan out to family who haven't upgraded to a HD yet.    And if we don't like the movie there are 2 markets to resell it to; HD-DVD and DVD.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I've watched plenty of anime over the years.  I'd consider this one to be among one of the more cool ones I've seen. I'd recommend buying this for a rainy day.  I bought it used for about $11-$12.  It's worth every penny.
1594489505|4.0|If you cannot understand American involvement (and potential failure) in both Iraq and Afghanistan, then this book is a good place to start.  Afghanistan, like Poland and many other countries in the world, is a crossroads, and has been subject to factional politics and invasions for centuries.  The Taliban is not a new phenomena, just a repeat of a particularly repressive form of government.    The gift of A Thousand Splendid Suns is the human story of two women and their courage and dignity under duress: their ability to endure the cruelty and humiliation outlasts the political and religious winds swirling around their lives.  They transcend.  On the human stage, Americans are generally blesssed with front row seats, and are both shocked and outraged, and sometimes ignorant, of conditions in other countries, and the profound effects of wars, undeclared wars, and \\"police actions\\" on the populations.  All to often, our aid comes with strings attached by current political ideology, and fails to help those in need.      So, America, read this book, and think about it.  We are not so far removed, and we have not been as generous with the world as we are capable of doing.  Mr. Hosseini has done a remarkable job conveying a difficult story.  The last few chapters neatly finished the story, and the ending was a little too happy -- otherwise, a five star book!
B000A3VTT8|5.0|I am so glad this production is on DVD - it's a vintage performance (early 1980s) and our family enjoyed the VHS of it until the tape wore out.  If you think you don't like opera, think again - you may like this one.  It doesn't try to be anything but what it is - a wonderful, musical retelling of the Cinderella story (with several twists - fairy godfather, evil stepfather, diamond bracelets instead of glass slippers), performed with lots of un-subtle humor and that amazing Rossini music.  You won't even mind the fact that you'll have subtitles to read.  The cast is brilliant, and Frederica von Stade creates a Cinderella character that will really warm your heart.  This is an opera for even \\"non-opera people\\" to enjoy!
B00008DDRX|5.0|I recall reading an article about this movie when it came out. It said that they filmed all the racing footage first and then wrote a story to overlay on the action and then filmed the people scenes to complete the \\"story\\".   Make no mistake about it. This is a feature length film about the cars and the track with some actors providing intermissions between the racing sequences. And as that it is great.  I have been to Le Mans for the 24 hour race and was fortunate enough the see these cars and the professional drivers in this film race on a number of tracks. Watching this movie is like taking a journey back to the golden days of endurance racing.
B000002NAK|5.0|The first time I heard this CD I had borrowed it for entertainment on a long road trip. I was immediately delighted by the sensuous, sweet, and loveable sound of the voice of the female lead singer playing Evita.  When I stopped at a rest stop, I looked at the CD jacket and liner and I was shocked to find out that what I was listening to was the 1996 movie version of this show starring Madonna.  I had never heard her voice singing such great songs or when it wasn't drowned out by canned percussion and other electronic effects and accompaniments.  But in this show you hear her voice so up close and personal, and it has this juicy, alluring quality that makes you fall in love with the character, regardless of how close or distant it is from the real person of Evita upon whom it is based.     I think Madonna, together with Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce singing the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Lyrics of Tim Rice makes us want to look into the real \\"herstory\\" of Evita and find out who this woman really was.  When I got home from my road trip, I started reading all I could about the real Eva Peron, the romantic story of her 33 year lifetime.  It seems that the movie capitalizes on aspects of the story that are historically uncertain.  There is disagreement over whether it was actually through her romantic involvement with a tango singer that she first came to Buenos Aires.        But when Madonna sings \\"Buenos Aires\\", you can feel the pulsing of the big apple in a young girl's veins.  The beat is contagious and the lyrics are enlivening, even more so since it is presented as a flashback, just after you witness the death of Evita and the ensuing despair of a nation in the beginning of the show.  You feel the despair in the haunting orchestral strains of \\"Requiem for Evita\\".       Banderas's cynical character Che is introduced in \\"Oh What a Circus\\", in which he begins his roll of the antagonist making fun of and criticizing Evita.  His character is based uponthe revolutionary Che Guevara.  With his presence on the scene I agree with other reviewers who have said that the show doesn't sway us toward any particular viewpoint about Eva Peron.  Again, I think it makes us want to know her.  When she asks \\"..where am I going to?\\" in \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\", we feel Madonna's character foreshadowing the coming events of her life.      \\"Goodnight and Thank You\\" is a sadly hilarious number in  which Che is singing to all the men that Eva has used in her quest for  power.  To Senor Jabon who found her a spot on the \\"sound radio\\" he  sings:     \\"We'll think of you every time she's on the air  We'd love you to stay  But you'd be in the way  So do up your trousers and go.\\"     When Evita (Madonna) answers with the chorus of \\"Oh, but its sad when a love affair dies\\", the sweet resonance of her voice ironically wins us over again.     In \\"The Lady's Got Potential\\", Che sings the chilling narrative of Eva as social climber attending a fund raising concert staged by military coup leader Juan Peron who is using an earthquake as a means of solidifying his power base.  This sets the stage for the two to meet.       The following number, \\"I'd be Surprisingly Good For You\\" is one of the highlights of this whole soundtrack of surprisingly good music.  It depicts the first meeting between Eva and Juan Peron, and it is one of the most beautiful falling in love songs I've ever heard, calling forth the memories or the fantasies of falling in love with a stranger and having him or her fall in love with you.       So the story continues with many more surprisingly gripping musical numbers.  You become engrossed in the story of this power hungry but loveable woman.  You can't help but wonder if the early decay of her physical body is a reflection of the self hatred she feels as a result of her self indulgence disguised as savior of the poor and suffering.     A lot of reviewers have compared Madonna in all sorts of ways  to the female leads in the earlier productions, such as Patti Lupone in  the original Broadway cast, and Elaine Paige of the original London  cast.  They all raise valid points.  But I think Madonna is  great in this role.  You can almost feel a parallel between Madonna  and Evita as being women who used their female charms to rise to the  pinnacle of power.  One became a corrupt \\"spiritual leader of a  nation\\", the other a pop icon.  When Madonna sings in \\"Rainbow  High\\":     \\"I came from the people  They need to adore me  So Christian Dior me  From my head to my toes  I need to be dazzling\\"    It almost reminds you of Madonna's Material Girl days.      There are many versions of this excellent show, including a new London  production that opened in 2006 with an Argentine lead, Elena Roger.   All the versions are great.  The show is a masterpiece of musical  theatre, and would probably be fun to listen to different versions and  find your favorite.  But it was the music of the  Madonna/Banderas/Pryce production that got me interested in checking out  the other ones, and learning about Argentine history.  I highly  recommend this 2 CD set, as I have yet to stop listening to and singing  the songs from it.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This is one of the most bloody, graphic films I have ever seen.  The torture goes on and on and on.  It's really over the top.  They should rename it \\"Torture of the Christ\\".  I couldn't see the point of the film.  Yes, Christ suffered a terrible price for our sins.  Crucifixion alone is a very horrible, painful death, but why keep showing scene after scene of beating and whipping and torn and bloody flesh?  Just too much.  What's the point?  The horrible suffering could have been made apparent without so much gore and so much time devoted to it.  I am dumbfounded that people found this movie powerful and moving and that it got such high praise.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Not much entertainment value and no real religious value that I can see.  Just a torture movie dressed up with religious themes.  Sorry, it didn't do a thing for me.  The only redeeming thing about this movie was that the period costumes were very impressive.  The question is, were they accurate?  The story seems to be mostly accurate, following the biblical account, as near as I could tell.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  There are many much better inspirational movies.  Don't let kids see this movie; it will be very disturbing to them.  Don't bother to see it yourself either.  If you are a Christian, there are much better ways to spend your time.  If you aren't, this movie probably won't change your mind.
0307237699|5.0|A very powerful and compelling book. But it left me with the question if there is any American Dream left to reclaim. Senator Obama is the perfect example of that famous American Dream which was once such a powerful engine behind the greatness of this nation. Yes, he was able to overcome so many cultural, racial and political devides, rising to the stature of a statesman and of a man of his own, with so many special qualities.  As an immigrant from Communist Romania, I started myself the quest for that American Dream twenty years ago. I was able to live it for a shortwhile, but it slowly decipated. Today I am wondering, like so many of my fellow Americans, what happened to it, and if Senator Obama's heartfelt thoughts can really galvanize that hope to bring it back. I was left with the thought of how the American Dream looks today from the eyes of the ordinary people, and not from the eyes of a politician, and if Senator Obama can look through those eyes too. It sounds like he can, but I was still left with that question of what happened to the American Dream. And I put that thought through the eyes of an ordinary American and would like to ask the Senator if he is seeing the same things.

0385333846|5.0|Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a fantastic book. The author's delicate sense of satirical humor and suave writing makes the book very readable. It's truly a masterpiece as Vonnegut managed to take a very serious topic--the bombing of Dresden--and make it accessible to the general reading public.     As I enjoyed the book immensely, I only have one complaint: it wasn't long enough! I would have gladly enjoyed reading another hundred pages and possibly a little more about Dresden.

Too many times I voiced the next line in the movie to the point my boy asked me \\"are you sure you haven't seen this before?!?\\"<br /><br />No, just that \\"been there, seen that\\" atmosphere that pervades this film, even if it's told from a different point of view. It did have some different elements missing from stories of this type, just enough to make it enjoyable for both of us.<br /><br />Good, silly fun. Enjoy!

B000H2MTUA|1.0|I wonder about the reliability of his memoirs.  The Irish are great storytellers--my dad once told me that Ireland produces the best storytellers.  However, this memoir is nothing but a revisitation of the same themes: Religion, Drinking, Sex, Poverty and then the kid grows up.  I felt like I had already read this book while reading it.  I don't believe it deserves a place on the classics of Memoirs.  Read a Tree Grows in Brooklyn ahead of this.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|Luis Mejia (son)- Depeche Mode certainly brings back the flame of music with this album, staying far away from the soft and awkward debilities of Ultra and Exciter, Playing The Angel is the return of their majestic way of making music. I recall it as the long lost Violator part 2.<br /><br />Playing The Angel is possibly their darkest album the've released, luckily it doesn't possess any weird alternative mood seen in many of their past albums, applying their \\"golden era\\" classic style in a new, modern, cultural way. Its also a much more studio proffessional album, staying far out from the alt-dance moods applied by Depeche Mode in the 80's. The album's moods are dark, aggressive, complex, deep and mature, focusing more on strong themes, the album possesses a relevant, complex and comprehensible structure not seen in maybe any of their past works. The album may sound awkward for many casual listeners, not an error, much more an strategy of Depeche Mode to be followed by a cult following.<br /><br />The songs' structure in the album fit certainly in fragments, although the whole album acts as a group, its more comprehensible if it divided in both halfs, or even in two by two songs. Well talking more about the tracks:<br /><br />A Pain That I'm Used To / John The Revelator: strong and fearful tracks full of emotions and controversial aspects very typic of DM. A Pain That I'm Usec To stayed in the Hot Dance Charts, while John The Revelator turned out to be a very famous track (personally I didn't like it) which I agree with another reviewer who said it would fit perfectly in Songs Of Faith And Devotion.<br /><br />Suffer Well / The Sinner In Me: Both extremely mellodic and thematic songs focused on strong themes. Suffer Well came out as the most famous song in the album.<br /><br />Precious / Macro: both excellent songs, maybe the only pair that doesn't fit together correctly, but both songs have very familiar sounds to Some Great Reward.

B000QUUD60|5.0|I'm updating my review to add:  I agree with the reviewers who complain about the quality and the editing decisions.  Why they would do that is a mystery and inexcusable.  However, I'm keeping the 5 stars because Elvis' performances are just so FANTASTIC!!  If this is the only way to see him perform these shows, then so be it-- Buy it to see a wonderful, talented, never-be-anyone-else-like-him entertainer at his best!  (And hope for a re-release with better quality and editing.)<br /><br />The rest is my original review:<br /><br />YUM!  I forget how awesome Elvis really was until I watch him on DVD again.  This should be a great set as I have both versions separately.  This is from the time period that most people think was Elvis at his very best--when he returned to live performances, lean & mean, after making those awful (his opinion) movies of the mid-60's.  (BTW--not all his movies were awful--Check out \\"King Creole\\" if you've never seen it.  What a waste of talent later on--but I'm wandering off-topic.)<br /><br />I prefer the second \\"Special Edition,\\" if I had to pick one, but the original has material that's left out of the re-edited edition, so both are desirable and worth buying.  Some of the fans such as the little old lady are still worth seeing in the original, and there are some songs there that are omitted from the Sp. Ed.  The new version has much more of Elvis' performances on stage all total in it and less extra material.<br /><br />Elvis was and always will be \\"the man.\\"  This is a great price for both these DVD's.  Wonderful material for fans and even those not that familiar with Elvis (and who don't know what they missed.)<br /><br />The \\"Aloha\\" set is great also, recorded a couple of years after this set.  Both these sets are fantastic.  And, the \\"Comeback Special\\" from a couple of years earlier (TV) is lean & mean, too.<br /><br />I just wish they'd release \\"The Lost Performances\\" and \\"Elvis On Tour\\" on DVD.  Cannot imagine why they haven't.  Maybe someday . . .<br /><br />Anyway, you won't go wrong with this set.  It's a classic and Elvis was so, so good!go wrong with this set.  It's a classic and Elvis was so, so good!
B00005Y7OJ|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Bilingual may be sincerely the worst album done by Pet Shop Boys, of course, the worst among the best, as I use to call it. Even when it went out after the excellent VERY, its obvious they couldn't follow the fame, still an enjoyable work and extremely mellodic.<br /><br />Bilingual may be a strong point of discussion among many aspects, apart from being its worst crtisized, its also too much into the dance aspects and the electronical arrengements fit strongly with the \\"discoteca\\" ambient instead of the studio efforts and proffessional mature composition. The songs are very mellodic and still enjoyable for even casual listeners, having a techno dance flavour far away from the focused electropop applied in past albums. Also the sound experimentatons went too far to the point of being out of tune and uninspired, like the typical sign of desperation of putting internartional moods and lyrics, and the cheap rap combination in most lyrics, specially in the songs Single, Metamorphosis and Electricity. The two tracks that keep the album of being a disaster are Discoteca, one of my favorites of PSB in their whole career, a song that keeps a lot of originality and effort, and Se A Vida &Eacute;, which stays very familiar with the sounds of Very, still very mellodic and comfortable. Even though, I have to admit that this album keeps some of the most catchy songs in their whole career.<br /><br />In conclussion this album goes through a lot of points of discussion, some find it very mellodic, some out of tune, some as the best (certainly not the best) and some as the worst, still you should draw your own conclussions.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The words \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"spectacular\\" don't even do this series justice.  I had watched four of the episodes when they aired, but getting the series on blu-ray is the best option.  It's really unbelievable to me that they captured so many astounding images from nature.  The camera crews must have had a TON of patience!  Anyways, kudos to Discovery and BBC for bringing us such a great series.  It really makes you appreciate nature and many of the things you'll see will really make you say \\"wow\\" (especially in HD)!
B000024QML|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - This album is one of the greatest works Pet Shop Boys has ever done, just about the perfect time (1992) and with the perfect catchy and juvenile dance rythms, very alike to the sounds of the 80's, if it would have been released in that time it would have been a much more famous work, but at any time is completely enjoyable. When I bought this album it was for me a risk, because everyone I know had told me that Pet Shop Boys was terrible, but even when I played the record to these people they changed their minds completely, of course, who wouldn't?<br /><br />This album assimilates a structure of techno dance rythms VERY enjoyable and terrific. Every song fits perfectly together, with its dance, electronical, joyful, comfortable moods displayed in the whole album. It's the most famous album of Pet Shop Boys and their most recognizable and completely comprehensible work, a great experience for anyone.<br /><br />Among the songs you can find any type of moods and rythms you may want to search for, like the famous songs Go West, wich is an interpretation (much better than the original) of the Village People song of the same titled album, I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind Of Thing, the second track, which is an electropop joyful theme being also a key song in this album, and Can You Forgive Her? one of the best tracks in the album being stunning, rythmical but joyful, also a thematic song, typical from Tenant, inspired by the Anthony Trollope's novel with the same name. Electronical ballads with romantic flavour (also typical from the band) like Liberation, one of the most popular songs in the album, also very soft and comfortable, A Different Point Of View, which is one of my favorites, being a strong and focused song similar to Can You Forgive Her? and Dreaming Of The Queen, not too much of a ballad but an extraordinary, mature and thematic song. Thematical, society overview songs like To Speak Is A Sin, Yesterday When I Was Mad, and Young Offender can also be found in the record. One In A Million, The Theatre and One And One Make Five are also catchy songs with a more serious mood in its lyrics. Certainly the best of this album is concentrated in the first three tracks.<br /><br />In conclussion the album is a stunning and very well done work for getting out of the 80's, with familiar sounds though, but completely enjoyable and unforgetable, a majestic work by the Pet Shop Boys.n also be found in the record.

Drama was excellent album from the band.Back in 1980 when this was released trever horn,jeff downes(the buggles)joined the band and did a great job they both had big shoes to fill (jon anderson,rick wakeman)but they pulled it off in there own way.The one thing I notice now from other reviews is the so called die hard yes fans that orignally bashed this release when it can out now praises it!Our ears have matured since then but some people should consider to be more open minded to yes music and there is a whole army of fans that feel the way.Anyway tempus fugit,does it really happen?are my favs on this cd.Trever horn made this band even bigger in the 80's when steve howe,alan white,chris squire,called it quits after the drama tour which did very well sold out every u.s tour date in 1980-81.Chris squire started another project with trever rabin and alan white then came tony kaye and then the great jon anderson returned and yes was reborn but with trever horn producing and co writing most of there songs in the 80's which open them up to the next generation (MTV)of yes fans.Drama you can honestly say is the bridge between the two generations.I'm glad old yes fans are giving this cd a second listen and loving it.five stars
015603252X|5.0|This 500+ page memoir by Israeli novelist Amos Oz is an absorbing \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" The first 200 pages are about his mother's and fathers' families, Russian-speaking emigrants to Israel in the 1930s from Eastern Europe. An only child, he devotes much of the rest of the book to his parents and the years until his mother's death when he was still a teenager. It is a richly detailed book peopled with a Dickensian cast of characters. He allows readers to experience a total immersion in the daily life of a low-income Jerusalem neighborhood during the years leading up to and following the creation of Israel in 1948. It is a troubling story, capturing on the one hand the intensely felt emotions of being young, self-aware, and sensitive, while portraying also the humiliations and the least flattering of the author's personality and character, all played against the difficulties of his parents' lives and what seems to have been a disintegrating marriage.<br /><br />Meanwhile, with its view of anti-semitic nationalism in Europe, readers can begin to understand something of the motivations driving zionist movements and the waves of Jewish settlement in Palestine before and after WWII. As Oz records the political discussions and obsessions of the friends of his parents, it's easier to understand the insularity and paranoia that led to the need for a homeland with defended borders and the eventual efforts to achieve military solutions to conflict with Palestinians and Arab neighbors.  Though recognized today as a peace activist, Oz provides only hints of his evolution to a broader view, describing only his complete break with his past by leaving home for a kibbutz at the age of 15. As a companion memoir, readers will also be interested in \\"Once Upon a Country: A Palestinian Life,\\" by Sari Nusseibeh.
B000JMK6LC|4.0|Everyone remembers where they were on certain days. When JFK was shot. When man landed on the moon. (I still say you see strings.) When John Lennon was murdered. (So far, too young for all of these.) When Princess Diana was killed (having a sleepover with my ex-best friend.) When September 11th happened - I was on holiday in the UK at the time. My now boyfriend had come home early from college, as he wasn't feeling great. I remember walking back to our caravan (how quaint) and someone in a neighbouring caravan telling us to switch on the news. We sat and watched the news unfold, and I still have a diary somewhere which I wrote in everything we were getting told, and how I was feeling. For some reason, I was worrying my friends back home in Scotland, even though we were still many miles away from New York.<br /><br />Flight 93, United 93 and World Trade Center all seemed to come about at the same time. I'm still not sure why. To make films of other people's suffering. But they're out there now, we can't stop them, all we can do is try and put ourselves in their place.<br /><br />World Trade Center is very well acted, with a brilliant cast consisting of Nicholas Cage (with a very bad moustache), Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jay Hernandez, Stephen Dorff and Michael Pe&ntilde;a. It's so well acted in fact you actually forget you're watching a film. I was holding my breath during some points in the film, and was nearly in tears at other points. Watching re-runs of the original news footage, was quite emotional. I do agree with some reviewers, that it did focus a bit too much on the two police officers stuck in the rubble - I had it in my head it was actually going to be them IN the World Trade Center, not stuck underneath the rubble. But it was brilliantly acted by Nicholas & Michael, it must have been so claustrophobic during those scenes and flat on their backs, amongst the 240 tons of material that was used to recreate a fully 3-dimensional Ground Zero in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The film spares the feelings for the people that were actually there, by not using footage of the planes actually striking the Twin Towers. We're shown how little the officers knew at the time, as they prepared to evacuate North Tower, they had no idea South Tower had even been hit.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello play the worried wives back home, anxiously waiting for news. Maria's character has four children with Nicholas's character, and Maggie is 5 months pregnant with their second child.<br /><br />After everything that has happened since 2001, a pointless war in Iraq which has done nothing but let even more people grieve, and attacks in London, it seems nothing can be done, unless the Americans come together and get a new President. As recently as a couple of weeks ago in 2007, Tony Blair finally stepped down as Prime Minister in the UK, and Bush should follow.<br /><br />I don't think any more films should be made about 9/11. 2,700+ people were lost that day, and with a mere three films out there retelling the story, it can't be pleasant for any Americans.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Based on a true story that marks an especially repugnant episode in Australian history, Noyce's visually arresting, powerfully moving \\"Fence\\" concerns efforts begun in the 1930s to recondition indigenous children of mixed heritage to be more \\"white,\\" through enforced training and the putatively superior discipline of civilized society. Sampi is marvelous as the scrappy and stoic eldest child, traipsing through the barren outback in tattered clothes and scavenging food with her clinging siblings while evading tracker Moodoo (David Gulpilil). Branagh is excellent, too, as the cold, noxious functionary obsessed with their capture. Don't hop this \\"Fence.\\"
B000F8O35U|4.0|The Little Mermaid has always been one of my favorite Disney movies.  The night my oldest daughter turned three, we had a movie night and watched The Little Mermaid together for the first time.

So, enjoy the movie, but use it as a time to talk to your kiddos about personal values and morals and what you expect in your family!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Director Scorsese's masterful portrait of poet/musician Bob Dylan's rise, leading up to the serious 1966 motorcycle accident that signaled a prolonged hiatus from touring. Intimate film makes it evident that Dylan would have taken a break from public performances anyhow, as his mid-sixties tour in England was met with hostility every time the singer picked up an electric guitar, further straying from his sacred folk roots. Fascinating sixties time capsule, and revealing meditation on artistic integrity and the nature of fame.
0061191981|5.0|I'll keep this brief, but if you're a fan of Gordon Ramsay anyway, you really should get this book. It's a much closer look into the life of a great chef following his struggles and triumphs through life.    I feel those that have only seen Hell's Kitchen are missing a different side to Ramsay. My other favorite show of his, Kitchen Nightmares, shows a much more caring side - still absolutely driven and brutally honest, but very caring. He truly wants to see these owners do well.    All I can say is grab the book if you want a closer look into the man, rather than his recipes.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|An engrossing portrait of one band's journey to personal hell and back, Berlinger and Sinofsky's \\"Monster\\" makes for fascinating viewing regardless of personal musical tastes. The central drama concerns the animus between recovering addict/lead singer Hetfield and arrogant drummer Ulrich, but the appearance of relatives and old bandmates keeps things at a cathartic pitch. Even Towle gets twisted around when the band decides he's gotten too embedded. Revealing and entertaining, \\"Monster\\" is a soul-searching rock'n'roll story like you've never seen.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I remember seeing all three movies when they first came out in theater.

B000A5044C|5.0|A lyrical, heartbreaking story based on a scandal that shocked Japan, Kore-eda's \\"Nobody Knows\\" considers the precocious self-sufficiency of four children who band together to survive. Soulful young actor Yagira is a marvel as Akira, a kid who longs to live a normal childhood but shoulders the burden of caring for sister Kyoko (Kitaura), who handles house duties, and a toddler-age brother and sister. As conditions inside the apartment worsen, the children become more dishevelled, and their plight sadder. Kore-eda's use of natural light and wrenching images of toys gives all this pathos a poetic veneer. The result is a film of strange, disarming beauty that packs a wallop.
6305841861|4.0|A chainsaw-wielding, shotgun-shooting enforcer of evil...enough said. Although the first Evil Dead had it's share of slap stick humor and gore, this sequel is definitely an upgrade over its predecessor. The gore is so over-the-top, you can't help but to laugh at the Kool-Aid spewing and syrup-spilling madness. The scene where the severed hand gets caught in the mouse trap and then flips off Ash is classic! A must own for any B-movie horror fan, or any horror fan for that matter.
B0000640SA|5.0|Ingenious thriller dares to be intelligent and different, and gets away with it. Since the audience sees most everything from Leonard's disoriented perspective, the movie requires more careful attention than your average thriller. Happily, \\"Memento\\" is suspenseful enough to command it. Pearce makes an ideal Leonard, a desperate man skirting insanity, but Pantoliano steals the show as the shady, enigmatic Teddy.

Warlock isn't the Anti-Christ. Instead, Adam Young is in a quiet village in England, neglected by all outside spiritual influences. He is the leader of his gang of four, and is basically an average English boy.<br /><br />This novel is a cute, amusing novel about the End of Time - the Apocalypse - Armageddon, etc. Gaiman and Pratchett stuck their tongues in their cheeks and produced a novel where Good knows it will win (it's part of the ineffability of the future), Bad tries to thwart and knows it has a chance, and there are still unanswered questions. We meet the descendant witch of the only person who got all the end time prophecies correct. The four horsemen (now on motorcycles) are here, although Pestilence has retired and given over to Pollution.<br /><br />Good Omens is fun, light. I enjoyed it.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Bizarre, hypnotic, and darkly dreamlike, this enigmatic mystery from \\"Blue Velvet\\" director Lynch cloaks the City of Dreams in a lush, noirish atmosphere, wringing every last drop of weirdness from its tricky double-narrative structure. Conceived as a series for ABC (imagine that!), \\"Drive\\" may elude straightforward logic, but keeps us hooked with the jolting appearance of strangers, corpses, odd changes of identities, and a voyeuristic sex scene that manages to be both disturbing and intensely erotic. Watts gives a particularly intriguing performance as alluring innocent Betty. Spooky and irresistible, \\"Drive\\" delivers a deliciously creepy take on Hollywood ambition.
0345409671|1.0|First, a couple of housekeeping notes.<br /><br />I understand that it is not wise to read the fifth book in a series first, and for that, my apologies. It was not entirely my fault, and is due to the way I am reading books now. Not wishing to advertise the book-delivery service I am using, I will not attempt to describe it to you, but it involves a certain amount of randomness. However, this will not be a problem, for reasons I will explain later.<br /><br />Secondly, I understand that it is not fair, or even consumerly helpful, to review a book when one has not read the entire thing. I apologize for this error to Ms. Rice, her heirs and assigns, and the members of the League of Wannabe Vampires and Assorted Sycophants. However, this is not entirely my fault, again.<br /><br />It is not my fault because this book is bad. Bad bad bad bad bad. It is very bad indeed. It is as bad as a bad thing of similar badness. It is bad enough to make the nation's unpublished writers -- you know who we are -- to throw up their collected hands and say, \\"For the love of God, I promise not to write this badly if I ever get rich and famous enough that publishers will publish every word I say, no matter how bad, if only I can, indeed, get published.\\"<br /><br />It's that bad.<br /><br />So it starts with Lestat. You will know Lestat from Rice's book about Lestat, unread by me. If you don't, there's a long introductory piece where he explains who he is and what he does for a living, which is being a vampire. (Rice mercifully allows experienced vampire readers to skip this part; you should, too.)<br /><br />So we have a vampire on the loose in New York. He runs across another vampire, and they share a hot drink at the bar. They have not apparently seen each other in awhile, so they go back and recap the plots of the last few Rice books, sharing anecdotes about the Queen of the Vampires and the Tale of the Body Thief. This sounds bad (if not completely overly commercialized rubbish) but is just a trailer for the badness to come. Trust me.<br /><br />The focus of this very long conversation -- maybe the longest conversation between two entities in the history of New York -- is Lestat's next victim. Apparently, Lestat has become a bit of a snob, and is only drinking the blood of those select few that are worthy enough to be his victim. It's about like listening to people who really, really, really know about wine talk about different vintages, when you drink mostly Dr Pepper. In other words, dull. (Dull is not the same as bad, but dull helps make bad as bad as it is.)<br /><br />So they go on and on and on about this victim guy, and then the vampires go their separate ways, and Lestat starts stalking his victim. There is a whole interior conversation that goes on when he decides whether he will attack the victim guy or not. If you've ever discussed where to have dinner with your significant other, when neither of you has expressed a clear preference, you know what it sounds like, so I won't bore you with it.<br /><br />Needless to say, Lestat does attack the victim dude. There are a few pages of old-fashioned vampire suckage. This is just fine. I hesitate to say that it is \\"good\\", because, you know, vampires are evil bloodsuckers and all that. But at least something happens. At least there's some action. And there are consequences to the action, as Lestat has to clean up after himself, hiding chunks of body parts through Manhattan. This is only somewhat tedious.<br /><br />So, his blood-lust sated for awhile, Lestat goes back to a bar and orders a drink, and is startled to see his victim return as a ghost. This is also fine, for a moment, anyway. Ghosts are cool as long as they don't hang around and make bores of themselves, and exit stage right when they're told without making bloody nuisances of themselves. This ghost doesn't do that.<br /><br />The ghost -- his name is Roger, as it turns out -- has an extraordinarily long conversation with Lestat,where he tells the story of his life. It is a life that is bound up with his fascination with an obscure medieval philosopher named Wynken, who went from being a monk somewhere to sleeping with multiple women. Roger, who, understandably enough, wanted to sleep with multiple women himself, tried to form a religion based on this premise. It didn't work out for him, so he became a rich drug dealer and plowed his earnings into religious relics or something.<br /><br />This is where I lost track, and gave up.<br /><br />You would have, too. The whole pointless conversation is simply bad. It reeks of tedium and despair and contempt for the reader, who, by the way, would like the Devil to show up, already, and start tormenting people.<br /><br />I never got that far. I figured out only that Ms. Rice -- as befits someone who has an unhealthy interest in vampires and the occult -- has a brief against organized religion, and that basically the book is a screed against that. I did a little bit of skipping ahead, in the interest of fairness, and the book seems to be about how God is a jerk and the Devil isn't such a bad guy after all. (But he must be bad if he inspired this terribly bad book, right? Right?)<br /><br />I suppose that I ought to have tried, anyway, to finish the book. But I didn't. I guess that makes me bad, too.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|Based on Patrick O'Brian's renowned seafaring adventure novels, Peter Weir's \\"Master\\" delivers an intimate, seemingly accurate portrayal of rugged life on the high seas, limited in creature comforts but rich in camaraderie. You can practically smell the salt air and taste the rum. Crowe makes a commanding but compassionate hero, and his friendship with ship doctor and scientist Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who'd like Aubrey to slow down so he can collect samples of unknown species, provides some interesting character by-play between the full-bore battle sequences. In all, a flavorful, bracing adventure, suitable for family viewing.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|A darkish film which moves along quite well. Thankfully devoid of obstreperous monsters, it coveys chillingly good performances esp. Emily R., whose contortions support the, mostly unseen, but very palpable result of evildoing. More should be like this as opposed to the graphics created monsters or, worse off, cheesy rubber-suited protagonists.
B000OY8NII|1.0|I only watched Disc #1 and then quit. Too boring for me. I had to fast forward through most of it. Even listening to some of the commentary didn't help get me interested. The characters are just too bland or over-the-top for my liking.<br /><br />Although I'm a Debrah Farentino fan, not even her hot body could keep me hooked on this quirky drivel. I could see myself watching this if there were only a few tv shows released on Dvd. Instead, I'll be watching \\"The 4400\\", Season 1, Disc #2. It's not fantastic, but it does interest and entertain me long enough to keep me watching. I also enjoy \\"Stargate Atlantis\\", \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" and Season #2 of \\"Weeds\\". I hate \\"Babylon 5\\".<br /><br />I also recently saw \\"Sliders\\" Season 1-Disc #1(first few episodes) and found them mostly painful to watch. I remember enjoying the later season's episodes better (many years ago), but was shocked at how bad the early ones look to me now. They just don't hold up well, over time (but I guess they knew that would happen).<br /><br />\\"Eureka\\" also shocked me. I wasn't expecting it to be so bland. With so many positive reviews, I'm obviously in the minority, but I still think you're all nuts for liking this so much. It's going on my list of 'Most Overated Tv shows', along with \\"Lost\\"-Season 2 and beyond. I guess we all can't have good taste. Just kidding...I think.
B00005JPSL|4.0|There's a light, good-hearted nature to \\"No Reservations\\" that's quite pleasing, if a little predictable. This is just as much a story of life as it is a story of romance, and we all know the formulas such films follow: a person's world is rearranged when someone new enters his or her life, and the laughter, tears, and conflict will be plentiful. I expected nothing less from \\"No Reservations,\\" which is probably why I was able to enjoy it. This is a charming, funny, touching film that casts away any qualms about being formulaic, which is a good thing for anyone in need of romantic escapism. I don't dare question how realistic the events of the film are; this is not a film that bothers with realism, but rather with the idealism that life is supposed to work in a specific way. At times, it's a welcome diversion.    The plot concerns Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the executive chef of an upscale New York restaurant. We immediately get the sense that hers is a very organized, controlled world; while not explicitly critical or demeaning, she is fiercely protective of what she's worked so hard for, namely her position at the restaurant. Here's a person that's strong on the outside but deeply insecure on the inside, exemplified by her inability to receive criticism (never complain about the food she prepares; you'll definitely regret it). For these reasons, she's ordered into therapy. She pretty much dominates her own sessions with incessant discussions on food preparation--appetizing, yes, but not exactly enlightening. Her therapist (Bob Balaban) is initially unable to ask any questions or give any advice. Clearly, she's afraid to let anyone examine her personal life.    Her world is turned upside down when her sister dies in a car accident, leaving behind a daughter, Zoe (Abigail Breslin). Because there's no father in the picture, Kate is now faced with the responsibility of caring for her. But will she know what to do? A child has never been a part of her life; being a chef is the only life she's ever known. She knows virtually nothing about Zoe, not even her favorite color. Furthermore, Zoe has lost her mother, meaning she'll need the extra emotional support Kate may not be able to give. It will be an adjustment, and a tough one at that; not only is Zoe unwilling to eat, she's also unwilling to let Kate get close.    In this regard, she takes right after her aunt, whose defensiveness runs on high after a new chef is hired. Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is a man with a bright, free-spirited approach to cooking: he listens to opera; he actively engages the other chefs; he's charming and witty. Kate finds him threatening, and initially treats him as such by being cold, critical, and distant. But when she decides to bring Zoe to work with her one night, she notices how well Zoe and Nick get along. He even gets her to eat. Thus begins a strained friendship that the audience knows will progress into something more. Of course, that's exactly what the audience hopes will happen. Quite simply, Nick is fun to be around and Kate is not; their coming together allows her to lighten up and let someone in emotionally.    As the film progresses, the relationship between Kate, Zoe, and Nick develops, not necessarily as it would for a family, but rather as it would for a group of friends. I never once thought that Zoe would ever see Nick and Kate as parental figures, which is just as mature on Zoe's part as it is sad. Likewise, I never once thought that Kate saw herself as a mother, despite her growing love for Zoe. The dynamic between these three characters is complex, especially when a number of other conflicts are introduced. For one thing, Zoe fragile state causes problems at school. It also threatens to ruin everything Kate has tried to accomplish. Both are trying, but it's clear that a lot of emotional baggage remains.    Herein lies the film's major weakness: most of Kate's emotional baggage is undefined. We do get a couple of brief mentions, such asher mother's passion for cooking and her father's absence from her life. But none of this is properly developed, and that made her controlling behavior seem less understandable and more uncalled for. Still, I was taken by the dramatic tension between her and Nick; watching an uptight person letting their guard down is both entertaining and uplifting. And I was definitely moved by her attempts with Zoe, who's just begging to be hugged and soothed and reassured that everything would be all right. There's a moment when she watches home video of her mother; Kate sneaks in, sits down, and holds Zoe tightly. You can practically see the emotion dripping off the screen, which is probably why it's effective.    Equally as effective is the growing love between Kate and Nick--a love that can go in any direction but ultimately treads the expected path. I've seen enough cinematic romances to understand that this is appropriate, maybe even necessary. \\"No Reservations\\" is the kind of film we occasionally want to see, if not for plausibility, then for the satisfaction of temporarily disappearing into a fantasy. It plays on our personal desires, namely those of happiness and well being in the midst of a crazy world. At one point, Kate says, \\"I wish there was a cookbook for life\\"; I found this clever, despite the overuse of the basic message. If it's possible for me to appreciate this kind of dialogue--or even a film with this kind of dialogue--then I think it's safe to assume that it's possible for you, too.
B0000C8WYB|5.0|There is nobody alive better suited to carrying on the tradition of French torch singers than Mireille Mathieu. To hear her cover Piaf's best-known songs is to be transported to the streets of Paris.

B00005JPAO|3.0|Great performances from all the actors. Have always adored Helen Mirren..... if you do, recommend \\"Prime Suspect\\" its great.<br /><br />Everyone I know loved it.<br /><br />I thought it was needlessly boring.  In times to come think this would seem like a fairly tame TV drama of a historical event rather than the brilliant movie everyone thinks it is.<br /><br />Sorry Your Majesty.
1881273156|5.0|This book was so helpful in understanding the relationships in my life!  I bought 6 of these books and gave them away to friends and all of them have raved about it! Gary has a fun and easily understandable way to communicate the love languages.  There's also a test at the end to further help you understand your primary love language and to also see where the other love languages fit into your life and our partner's life.
B000005AYM|5.0|Waste of time reading this review - just get the album.    Discovered her about 100 years after everyone else ... on Dave Chappelle's Block PArty.  Sings like an angel, is drop dead gorgeous as smart as Einstein.
B00003CWPL|5.0|David Lynch is a genius. From his more \\"mainstream\\" movies, such as Dune and Elephant Man, to his quirkier works like Wild At Heart, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet and more recently Inland Empire, his films have been dark, creepy, moody and often, at the same time, hilariously funny. His visual imagery, while often simple and stark is also awe inspiring. He uses light and shadow with music and sound to create mood like no one else. Surreal twists of fate and bizarre happenings mark all of his work. He took all of that creative brilliance and changed television forever with Twin Peaks. People often ask of his work \\",What does it mean?\\" I think his most lasting gift is that it always means whatever you want it to.<br />  Eraserhead is a masterpiece, creating for us a lonely, dark, industrial world of looming shadows and ominous stretches of silence peppered with clever twists of plot and dialouge. It is an introduction to the world of David Lynch, rich with all the promise of the filmaker's career that it ushered in. Perhaps one of the most atmospheric movies ever made it stands alone as a classic in a genre it created. Brilliant!!

B000K7VHSM|5.0|DVD is perfect but due to its US Zoning, I could only read it on my PC in low definition, and not on my TV linked HD-DVD nor my std DVD. This was a huge disappointment for me. Since I did not find a version with Europe Zoning suitable for France elsewhere, I did not return but was very upset not having been alerted properly on that.   I would have expected a clear zoning indication plus a warning in your ordering system when a customer from a country not in scope of DVD/HD-DVD zoning tries to order it.   Regards.
B000O76T90|5.0|The original (PERIOD) Die Hard turned Bruce Willis into a bonafide film star. Moon Lighting was good, but McClane is Bruce and vice versa. This film is one of the, if not the very best action film ever made. It has all the explosions, blood, witty remarks and bullet holes that have defined the genre, and in plentiful supply. I can't imagine anyone has NOT seen this, but if you are out there, do not hesitate. The original is the best. Yippee Kai Yay....
B0000AXE8I|2.0|If all of humanity has united in the future against the machines, why are most of the humans African Americans with either close-cropped hair or dreadlocks who either self-consciously elocute hyper-standard North American English or saturate each sentence with U.S. ghetto cursing? Who wrote the script and did the casting for this film, Louis Farrakhan? Where are the Chinese or the Indians? Where are the Africans for that matter? Forget the machines: Does the future really look this bad for human ethnic integration? Is the present this ignorant?
B000LC4TJ0|4.0|Turning a comedy such as Figaro into something tragic is not an idea that I find attractive.  Yet it seems to me to have some merit, after watching this production.  I consider this a DVD that is worth watching once and a while, bit by bit.   Be prepared for a Countess who is too abused to have any fun cross dressing Cherubino.   The Count is portrayed as an axe murderer, again this is plausible.  I find many Salzburg productions easy to hate, but this slow dark vision has some traction, despite my initial thoughts of consigning it to the Eurotrash bin.
B00003CXMG|5.0|If you want to read about the plot, go to someone else's review, or peruse the back of it in a store. I am sure you know what it's about. What Cameron Crowe has done, is design a world that seemingly you feel a part of. This utopia where dreams in fact can and do come true, where if you just have some guts and some brawn and go with your heart, the road may lead to a different path than you first intended, where music placed in the most perfect of scenes can transport you to a time of endless love and karma and you can, if only for an hour or two, wonder why the world can be so cruel and unkind. Kate Hudson is radiant. I fell in love with Penny Lane. I wanted to run my fingers through her hair, let her cry on my shoulders, sing to her. I feel in love with Billy Crudup, his passion for music ignited another fire in me that was brewing for some time: to get out and see the small things that perhaps in the day to day heydey of living, I take for granted. If you haven't seen this yet, take the plunge, watch more filmmaking that crosses the threshold from simply a movie, to a journey.<br /><br />That my fine friend, that in all its joyous craft and benevolence is what Almost Famous is to me. A journey of the heart, a journey of the soul and a journey of a boy and a dream and the perservarance to give it all he could. Truly something that finally deserves 5 stars in my book. Cameron Crowe is a powerhouse with this motherload!<br /><br />So grab a handful of this and run with it, it deserves a place in your heart as well.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I love Season 3. Why?   1. We get to see Lorelai as a teen and the whole Rory backstory.  2. The Fire at the Inn is my favorite episode  3. Rory's hair  4. Paris/Rory's friendship really starts rolling  5. School choice--surprising yet understandable  6. Lane's band  7. I like the Jess as a boyfriend/Dean as a friend angle  8. Birth of Gigi    So many reasons. I really feel like this is the season that everything got rolling. There is a great emphasis on the town and all it's quirks. Patty's \\"One Woman Show\\" is especially fun.

B000001E18|5.0|Just an awesome album. One of the best of the last quarter century.     It comes the closest, in music and lyrics, to describing our post modern, media saturated world, and the humanity that created it, and that are enslaved by it, than any album has.     And the throw-away nature of it is the best part.    The least \\"purposeful\\" U2 album, and also the most important.       An unmatched classic.     It's that good.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|With so many excellent and comprehensive reviews posted on Amazon, the details of this film are well recorded. Yes, the print is good, but not excellent; yes, the acting is dated, Garbo is miscast and Crawford is attractive and dynamic with a warmth and empathy far removed from the outrageous character she became; yes, John Barrymore has a great rapport with Garbo; yes, the decor is an art deco feast; yes, the film falls somewhere between German dourness and American glitter etc etc.     But what of the extras available with the DVD?  Well, first there is a succint documentary about the film which neatly summarises its importance in 1932, the very first all star extravaganza from the plush MGM.  Next, there is a newsreel about the opening of the film which provides a rare glimpse of the personas of some famous stars, among others a nervous Joan Crawford, accompanied by her then husband Douglas Fairbanks Jnr, the pretentious Norma Shearer and Louis B Mayer, head of MGM and not missing an opportunity to market his studio product.    There is also a Vitaphone short \\"Nothing ever Happens\\" which parodies the film because sure enough, nothing happens. The highlight is the precision chorus which perform some very fast tap dancing and high kicks, probably just like the Rockettes at the Radio City Music Hall - wow!    The extras also include the original trailer for the film and \\"Weekend at the Waldorf\\", the plastic remake from the mid forties. This, in particular, emphasises the star power and film making expertise of the original.  There is absolutely no contest between Garbo, Crawford and the Barrymores versus Ginger Rogers, Lana Turner, Van Johnson and Zavier Cugat etc. It is a measure of how MGM had slipped.    The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of a Garbo Collection.
B00009P1O2|5.0|The concert is great.  The music sound is great and watching the video on a large computer screen is great.  However, I don't recommend the video for high definition tv's.  It shows somewhat scratchy on a high definition screen but the sound is still very good.  Queen gives an outstanding performance and Freddie Mercury delivers high energy with powerful vocals.  All of the songs are favorites for Queen fans.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I'm not one for black and white movies, but on movie night it was my wife's turn to pick and we ended up watching Casablanca.  I was very impressed by the restoration of this movie and the movie its self.  It's a very enjoyable movie to watch.  The special features were not too bad as well.  I think that anyone could sit down with a beer or a bag of popcorn or both and not walk away disappointed after watching Casablanca.

B000N0WCLC|4.0|I had my doubts about this movie since I'm not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Great story and awesome action sequences.  This movie is a must buy for blu-ray owners.
B0002PZMSS|5.0|On this legendary album, Reed celebrates Andy Warhol and his 15-minutes of fame stars in a glamrock style, influenced by David Bowie. This new edition includes two extra tracks, acoustic versions of Hanging Round and Perfect Day. The informative insert includes illustrations and an essay on the history of Reed and the significance of this album.<br /><br />Transformer is a type of decadent cabaret comparable to Bowie's Alladin Sane, but it is less bleak and much more colourful and engaging. Reed proved himself to be a master of many styles, from the compelling rock of Walk On The Wild Side through the tender and tuneful pop of Satellite Of Love to the oneiric Perfect Day, a haunting poetic excursion.<br /><br />Other highlights include the edgy rocker Vicious with its hypnotic melody and sarcastic/ironic lyrics (an attitude that would soon infuse punk and new wave), the quirky New York Telephone Conversation, the energetic Hanging Round and the stately Goodnight Ladies. The songs are highly descriptive of a time, a place and a mindset, and the music is powerful in places and very elegant.<br /><br />The stylistic variety renders Transformer compelling throughout while not detracting from the cohesion, making it a great piece of musical theatre. Devoted followers would agree that it does not reveal the complete Reed, as he has been so prolific and his oeuvre encompasses a much larger spectrum. But as a document of the middle seventies, it remains superb, an essential album for all serious rock fans.
B00005JP5P|4.0|I thought the movie was well done. The acting the direction the writting and the cg effects. If your a scifi fan check this movie out.
B000PFT1ZU|5.0|These songs are harrowing but beautiful and ultimately rewarding if you can survive its labyrinthine descent into heartbreak and despair. The most melodic songs include Caroline Says I and II, the wistful Oh Jim, the painful The Kids, the bleak The Bed and the soulful Sad Song.<br /><br />Over these beautiful melodies Reed lays his vocals that are so genuine, so apt and so gripping that listening to them is like being privy to the private details of a doomed relationship. Of course, these all fit the complete picture to create one of the most cohesive and searng concept albums in rock, from the jazzy intro of Berlin with its lounge piano through the spoken poem of Lady Day, right to the melancholy last refrains of Sad Song.<br /><br />The grand production and sympathetic arrangements add gravitas to the somber mood to create a dark masterpiece of epic proportions. Somewhat inaccessible to some fans, Berlin has nevertheless improved with time and remains one of Lou Reed's greatest albums.
B000P2A24W|5.0|This is a great album.  I really like Bon Jovi alot. What I like about    this album that the songs don't sound the same, like some other artists.    I would pick this one!
B000H5TZTU|5.0|The Blue Mask has stood the test of time very well in Lou Reed's oeuvre and is amongst my top 5 Reed albums. The varied material takes us from domestic bliss in My House (\\"I've really got a lucky life/My writing, my motorcycle and my wife\\") to extreme emotion and paranoia (\\"I cringe at my terror/I hate my own smell/I know where I must be/I must be in hell\\") which is a near perfect description of a panic attack.<br /><br />In a way, this album returns to many of the themes that had inspired Reed from the start of his career with the Velvets: His mentor, poet Delmore Schwarz is invoked in the opening track, reminding the listener of the Velvets's European Son (to Delmore), while Underneath The Bottle, an account of his struggle with alcohol, brings to mind an earlier song The Power Of Positive Drinking from the album Growing Up In Public, and the beautiful Heavenly Arms with its gorgeous fading choruses is not too far removed from Satellite Of Love on Transformer.<br /><br />But the approach is different: gone is the decadent narrator of the demi-monde, and instead Reed turns into an essayist or reporter writing and singing with great maturity but still passionately about subjects as diverse as women, gun violence and the day John Kennedy died. The guitars of Reed and Quine, the bass and the drums work perfectly together, whether on the slow numbers or on the more intense rockers like Waves of Fear or the title track. Best of all, the melodies are strong and memorable and the arrangements are innovative. The Blue Mask is excellent in every way!
1596912375|4.0|I'm not much of one for so-called \\"spy novels,\\" but this gripping story almost made me a convert.  It is the premise of the story that gives it such zip, in addition to fine writing by the author.  Think of a situation where it turns out your own mother is entirely a different person, that is has a different background, that you had been led to believe by her, and in fact she had been a spy before and during World War II. Add to this her fears that she is in danger after all these  years (the novel is set in 1976) and this leads her to \\"come clean\\" with you.  More I will not reveal but it is, at points, a real \\"page turner.\\"  The book shifts back and forth between the mother's spy career and the present day activities of her daughter--and this does tend to slow things down a bit.  Also there are some superfluous subplots involving the daughter which also dilute the action sequences on occasion.  Nonetheless, there are stretches where the book is simply gripping and one becomes entirely engrossed in it.  A highly unique premise and a most stimulating story.
B000CSUUP0|4.0|On Magic & Loss Reed investigates mortality, loss, guilt, rage and resignation. Each song has a subtitle and a mystical symbol, tracking the issue in full circle and attempting to cover all aspects and relevant emotions of the chosen theme.<br /><br />The best tracks, because their melodies make them stand out, include Sword of Damocles (Externally) with its flash of humor (\\"That mix of morphine and dexedrine/We use it on the street\\"), Cremation (Ashes to Ashes), the strange, funny and sad Harry's Circumcision (Reverie Gone Astray) and the powerful rocker What's Good.<br /><br />As on his New York album, the instrumentation is sparse with only guitars, bass, percussion and drums. It is a moving and literate piece of work, but ironically lacks some of the magic found on most of his best albums. Perhaps because he chose a rigid framework, the overall impression is one of sameness and lack of variation.<br /><br />Still, it is by no means a uniformly bleak album, and at least lyrically, there is plenty of material that ranks among his best work. The sound is reminiscent of the [[ASIN:B000002LGA New York]] album, but unlike that one which is his least personal work, this one focuses on the loss of specific friends and his reaction to death, making it highly personal and intimate in its exploration of universal themes.<br /><br />A good album then, but not a Reed work that I listen to very often. My real rating is three and a half stars.
B00000FCBC|5.0|In 1998, after the combined commercial success and critical (or fanatical) failure of \\"Load\\"/\\"Reload,\\" Metallica once again took the dive and made another bizarre career move: Recording a covers album. Two discs: The first, of \\"new\\" covers. The second, a collection of covers the band had recorded and released sporadically through the years, compiled on one disc. Although it may not have taken the men of Metallica much time or effort to churn out \\"Garage Inc.,\\" it all sounds so natural and rocks harder than much of the \\"Load\\"/\\"Reload\\" material, and anything else they have recorded since.<br /><br />Firs things first: The first disc. Disc one is home to not only the two memorable Metallica singles of the time, \\"Turn The Page\\" and \\"Whiskey In The Jar,\\" but also a few well-known tunes (\\"Tuesday's Gone,\\" \\"Sabbara Cadabra\\") and quite a few obscurities. If you've never heard Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Astronomy\\" or any of the four Mercyful Fate tracks that they pack into the medley of the same name, you'd almost think Metallica had recharged their batteries and come up with their best material since The Black Album. Since most of the album is about applying the Metallica trademark to songs that were great already, it's only a bonus that they do some experimenting along the way. Ever wondered what Metallica would sound like if they went industrial? Take a listen to Discharge's \\"Free Speech For The Dumb.\\" Likewise, their take on Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" isn't so much a cover tune as it is a full fledged jam session with members of Primus, Faith No More, Corrosion Of Conformity and Alice In Chains. Most rewarding, however, is the fact that Metallica have transformed so many of these songs so well, that when you hear the originals again, you'll yearn for the Metallica version instead.<br /><br />The second disc, a little more obscure than the first, is still home to some solid material. Queen's \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is perhaps the cream of the crop, as it's interesting to hear James Hetfield's take on a Freddie Mercury track. The Misfits' \\"Last Caress\\" gets some beefing up, and the set closes with four, count 'em, four delicious Motorhead covers. Although the material on disc two isn't always up to the quality or the noteability of the first, it's a great gift to the fans and compliments the first disc quite well. \\"Garage Inc.\\" is simply an album that has an inifinite shelf-life. Metallica will always rock, and their best material will always sound good and transcend whatever genre is popular at the moment. And the fact that they turned a cover album into such a noteworthy piece of music speaks volumes about their talent. It's just too bad they haven't applied that know-how to some of their more recent material. Until they prove otherwise, \\"Garage Inc.\\" is their last great album.s take on a Freddie Mercury track.

B000LXFZ88|5.0|Although the boundaries have shifted in the decades since this album's release, Broken English has lost none of its trenchant appeal. And despite angry grrrl groups using explicit lyrics, Why d'Ya Do It? still sounds fresh, perhaps because it originally was written as a poem by Heathcote Williams.<br /><br />Her version of Lennon's Working Class Hero sounds as sharp as ever, while the brooding title track is still relevant today. On the melodic side, Lucy Jordan has become quite a standard and could easily be considered a country weepie, while Witches' Song remains eerie and anthemic. The sound is typical 80's rock with tight musicianship supporting this classic monument to decadence and despair.<br /><br />This is probably her best selling album of all time for all the wrong reasons! The other two works from the same period, [[ASIN:B000001F3F A Child's Adventure]] and [[ASIN:B000006YM0 Dangerous Acquaintances]], are equally excellent and will richly reward the listener. Nevertheless, Broken English stands tall as a masterpiece of broken taboos, subversive poetics and timeless songs.

B000OHZJKK|5.0|This second album by Elvis Costello is far better than My Aim is True, in my opinion. The tunes are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling. It marks the transition to his wonderfully accessible [[ASIN:B000OHZJKU Armed Forces]] masterpiece.<br /><br />There is even a reggae beat in (I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano - Little Triggers. My favourites are the up-tempo Pump It Up and the poignant This Year's Girl, plus of course the pulsating Radio Radio with its subversive lyrics. This Year's Model is one of the top albums of the 1970s.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OHZJJQ The Best of Elvis Costello: The First 10 Years]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000009VO The Very Best Of Elvis Costello And The Attractions]]

B000I1GQRM|5.0|This classic work explains the miracle of the power of mind in a clear and concise way and leads to continual self-improvement. Explaining the fact that each individual has two minds, the conscious and the subconscious, it proceeds to explain the function of each and how powerful the subconscious is.<br /><br />The great subconscious power must however be directed by the conscious mind, and that is the individual's responsibility. The various techniques for directing the subconscious, like affirmation and visualization, are clearly explained. Many helpful affirmations are provided to kick-start the process of healing and many examples are provided of how people solved their problems by correcting their thinking.<br /><br />This inspiring book is immensely therapeutic in cleaning cobwebs and dogmatic brainwashing from the mind. I recommend this as the very best entry point in the entire field of self-improvement. I also recommend Mind Magic by Marta Hiatt. Other authors whose work is also of great benefit in this regard, include Catherine Ponder, Louise Hay, Emmet Fox and Frederick Bailes. Joseph Murphy's books on cultivating a consciousness of prosperity are very helpful too.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0060628618 Power Through Constructive Thinking]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000QJLXH4 The Hidden Power of the Bible]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0875162010 Your Mind Can Heal You]]

Everyone that I've recommended it too thought that it's an incredibly wonderful, happy, sad. heartwrenching, warm story. It is definately the best book that I have ever read. Even better than Kite Runner, and I didn't think that was possible. I hope Khaled Hosseini never stops writing. He has a special talent that puts you right there in Afghanistan. I could see in my mind the country, the wealth and the poverty. It's a stunning book that tears out your heart and makes you cheer. I never thought that I'd ever read a book better than Kite Runner or The Red Tent. But I have. Keep writing. When your next book comes out I'll be the first in line.

I like all the other classic Floyd music, but it's been soooooo played to death over the years, so hearing this is like a breath of fresh musical air. Some of the soft moments on this CD are really nice, such as \\"Mudmen\\" and \\"Stay\\". You rarely see this in record store bins, but if you like Pink Floyd as a fan or casual listener, this is a good addition.

B000002UAU|5.0|SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND stands at the pinnacle of 1960s record-making, credited for ushering in the psychedelic era, opening up new production techniques, and giving rock musicians the freedom to follow their muses.  Hailed upon its release as a breakthrough, an experience over an album, SGT. PEPPER spent the next twenty years ranking as the \\"Greatest Album Ever,\\" and it still maintains its heavyweight status.    One of the most interesting facets of the SGT. PEPPER experience is that for a record hailed as a psychedelic landmark, it isn't all that psychedelic, at least not when compared to 1967s other flagship albums: SURREALISTIC PILLOW (Jefferson Airplane), ARE YOU EXPERIENCED (Jimi Hendrix), FOREVER CHANGES (Love), THE DOORS (self-explanatory), and THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN (Pink Floyd).  SGT. PEPPER is largely the manifestation of Paul McCartney's pop inclinations matched with peerless production, its an old-fashioned entertainer's album for the rock era.  Even among the more production-oriented records of the era, PET SOUNDS (The Beach Boys) and DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED (The Moody Blues), it still sounds straight forward.
B000AP04OM|5.0|To teach the children to sing Do-Re-Mi is a very good song to remember the first three notes of the music!!
B000P7V45S|3.0|KEEP YOUR 94's. So much sounds so different here, it's like it's not even the same mix. It's out with the cozy and familiar, in with the...scary. Collins' vocals sound too high. The speeds of \\"Squonk,\\" \\"Ripples,\\" maybe other tracks, sound sluggish, actually slower. The keys on \\"Entangled\\" are quite attenuated, and the bass thuds to the ground and stays there in certain places. The vibes are generally weird and bastardized-sounding throughout, and the volume is also cranked way up (usually suspicious when nothing's been done, but here brazen and purposeless). In the light of all this, who cares if you can hear the lyrics better? Or a bell or a whistle... I have my doubts about the validity of the harmonic backing vocals on \\"Dance on a Volcano\\"; again, just be prepared to hear something that either wasn't properly hearable or wasn't even supposed to be hearable before this release. I haven't found much to commend this effort; they've taken a smooth, lovely, and quietish album and made it sound like there're new-agey space mutants tickling their tendrils all over the control board, geekily pushing buttons. They must've pushed one of mine. I'm so glad the recent ELP remasters didn't go this way. You're still hearing Genesis but you might start kicking yourself for humming along.<br />UPDATE 2013: Time has allowed my ears to take this release as not being quite so obnoxious as what I wrote above. I'm glad to have it for the ah-ha sounds, though much prefer the straighter remixes they did of the rest of the 2007 catalogue.
0395631246|5.0|This is an excellent book on negotiation -- for beginners and professionals alike.

0761536434|3.0|The final impression left on me by \\"The Ultimate History of Video Games\\" is that I was actually reading two different books--one on the early history of video games (up to about the time the NES was released) and one on the late 80s to turn of the century era.  The first half or so of this book is obviously a labor of love, and though it does have its limitations the narrative is both smooth and engaging.  The book is not exceptionally well written, but throughout the pre-video game era and all through the Atari years Kent manages to weave a narrative that is entertaining and reads well.      A host of quotes from firsthand sources is peppered throughout the narrative, and most of them serve to add to rather than detract from the overall quality of the book.  Nolan Bushnell, Al Alcorn, and many others provide anecdotes and relate the early history of video games from the point of view of those who made it happen.  The pre-video game era, the rise of Atari, the coin-op arcade business, and the advent of home console gaming is all chronicled here.    But then something happens to the narrative.  Around the time Nintendo breaks into the console market with the Famicom the details become more sparse.  Short blurbs about the Super NES pop up before the NES has even hit American shores, and entire chapters on litigation, with very little narrative and mostly lifted from transcripts, bog the story down.  It seemed to me that I could almost feel Kent losing interest in the project, and my own interest tapered and then almost completely left as well.      The quotes are still there, but the overall feel of the book goes from a man telling the story through the eyes of the people who lived it to that of a high school book report.  That may seem harsh, but the \\"and then this happened, and then this happened...\\" quality of the mid 80s through mid 2001 years left a great deal to be desired.  Some of the most significant developments in gaming are glossed over with surprising indifference, and anyone who hoped to relive their glory days of gaming will be disappointed if those days occurred in the days of Nintendo, Sega, or Sony consoles.    It's hard to blame this entirely on Kent, of course, since the industry expanded so much during the late 80s and 90s that it's difficult to imagine being able to cover things with the level of detail and attention given to the 70s and first half of the 80s.  Still, many of the omissions are glaring and, in my mind, inexcusable.  While Sega's war with Nintendo during the Genesis/Super NES days is covered, very few games for those systems receive any attention whatsoever.  Sonic, Mario, and Donkey Kong are covered, of course, but most everything else is either given scant treatment or is omitted entirely.  Golden Axe is mentioned in passing, the Final Fantasy series is eventually given a couple pages (but not until he mentioned Squaresoft's defection from Nintendo to Sony).  Kent leaves out the fact that there were Zelda games for both the Super NES and the N64 and forgets to mention Super Mario Kart as one of Nintendo's titles for the Super NES (he does mention Mario Kart 64 without pointing out that it was a sequel).  Starfox is mentioned in passing or in a caption somewhere, and I think I saw the name 'Megaman' twice.    In addition, \\"Ultimate History\\" does not deign to discuss PC gaming with anything but a passing nod in the PC's direction.  Myst and 7th Guest are mentioned, and Wolfenstein and later Doom are brought up a few times (mostly in conjunction with video game violence), but that's about it.  Fans of such enormously popular franchises such as Civilization, Quake, Command and Conquer, anything made by Blizzard (Diablo, Warcraft, Starcraft, etc), Age of Empires, or the Star Wars universe will no doubt wonder why their games are not considered part of the 'Ultimate History' of the video game industry, but this question will go unanswered.  Online gaming, which was already very popular when thisbook was published in 2001, is ignored entirely.         In short, \\"The Ultimate History of Video Games\\" is anything but ultimate.  I realize that the title was the idea of the publisher, but in my mind the author, who is very familiar with the industry, should never have conceded to label the book an 'ultimate history.'  In fact, I think Kent should have ended his narrative when the NES console burst onto the scene and billed it as the ultimate history of pre NES video games.  To that I would have conceded, and would have given the first part of the book 4 stars if I could have.  The second half deserves no more than 2 (and I'm being fairly generous) and in my opinion drags this book down from something worth owning to something barely worth finishing.  It's obvious the passion infused in the early part of the book is gone, which is a shame--the first few hundred pages of this book are a great source of video gaming history.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|This movie describes the war in Iraq, how the Marines behave and the problems they face. However it is a bit slow and sometimes tedious.
0374530718|4.0|It is a creative way to introduce philiosophic concepts to high schoolers. A number of important philsophers are not discussed at all or very cursorily.

Much more could have and should have been done with Francis Bacon. But, much is accomplished in only a few hundred pages. A worthy effort

B000T433CO|2.0|I am actually a fan of Jack Black and I think that a movie could be written where he's a romantic lead.  But this wasn't it.  He looked unconfortable and his acting was awkward.    The story was uneven.  It was mostly with the american chick in England and the part with the English chick in the USA was mostly an afterthought.    The download wasn't very sharp.  For some reasons Amazon makes some very good downloads but sometimes they are just not very sharp... This was not a very sharp movie (I mean literarily.. it was a bit blurry)    The part with the English guy crying was very weird.  I would say gay, but I think gays are more macho than this guy.... I mean really.  Guys do cry but not this blathering... sheesh...    Not awful but not very good either

B000063UR2|1.0|I've never been much a fan of fantasy movies with magic, elves and fairies.  Even today I had to force myself to sit through all of the Lord of the Rings movies when in the theaters, knowing this would be the first and last times I would ever see them.  But I try to give each and every movie a try, even years later, thinking that I have changed and perhaps life experiences will make me see the movie in a different light.  This movie, however, was just plain annoying.    Tom Cruise, in perhaps the movie that would eternally put his sexuality in question, plays a sprite named Jack who is in love with a pretty maid named Lilly.  They meet in the woods, hold hands and kiss like live action Disney characters (NOTHING further, much to the chagrin of those wanting to see Tom Cruise el fresco), when he lets Lilly touch a unicorn (some kind of no no in the woods).  The horn breaks off and the forest is cursed in eternal darkness and winter.  He and Lilly are somehow seperated, Jack meets up with a bunch of fellow woodland creatures, and they go to the depths of the NetherWorld to solve things.      I guess it had a good premise for a plot, but the whole thing was hoaky.  The acting was cheesy at best, the special effects can't carry the weak plot, and it seemed to give up at some point.  You knew that good will triumph over evil from the beginning.  I wonder if Tom Cruise acknowledges this today, as he's never done a movie before or since to this extreme.  It never even found an audience among those who loved fantasy media, and has since been forgotten had Tom Cruise not once starred in it.      So get a shovel, you'll need it to clean up after the mess this unicorn makes.

1400063515|4.0|Okay, I'm a member of a cult of anti-Talebites (NuclearPhynance), and therefore everyone is dying to know what I think &lt;cough! cough!>.....NOT!<br /><br />So here goes.<br /><br />I liked it. I liked Taleb's The Black Swan in the same way I like Charles Dickens. Dickens you see, in each of his works, has a single theme, which he carefully develops in the opening chapters and then flogs to death long past when it is obvious. But to keep you engaged in the theme, he creates characters worth following until the novel's resolution.<br /><br />***Begin Spoiler***<br /><br />And so it is with Taleb. His theme is: the standard normal distribution is inappropriate, outcomes really do have weird fat tails of events, measure theory and approximation of real probability curves and spaces is hopelessly naïve and at the level of alchemy, and folks are dangerously lulled into a false sense of security because of arbitrary historical measures that are *sure* to break down.<br /><br />And Popper is a god. (I'm sorry, a scientific theorist par excellence).<br /><br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />The rest is anecdotes and amplifications and narrative and opinions and self-contradiction.<br /><br />\\"Do I contradict myself?<br />Very well then I contradict myself,<br />(I am large, I contain multitudes.)\\"  - Walt Whitman, \\"Song of Myself\\"<br /><br />None of what Taleb amplifies is unknown to anyone who works in quantitative finance. Pretty much everyone I know *knows* that models approximate reality and are not coincident with reality. Everyone knows the limits of probability estimation. Everyone knows a lot of what passes for science is nonsense on stilts.<br /><br />The question then becomes: is it a good read? The answer for me is a resounding \\"yes.\\" Like hearing a familiar tale told with a fresh and welcome voice, The Black Swan is fun to read and has many treasures in turns of phrase.<br /><br />Folks fault Taleb for his arrogant tone, dismissive rhetoric, and contradictory examples, but I find that just facets of an amusing personality and raconteur. I know the difference between a Magician and a Mathematician, a storyteller and codewarrior.<br /><br />As opposed to other reviewers, it was too familiar material to really stretch my mind, but a fun read anyway.<br /><br />I was most disappointed that William Poundstone's \\"Labyrinths of Reason: Paradox, Puzzles, and the Frailty of Knowledge\\" and \\"The Recursive Universe\\" wasn't credited more heavily....it was clear to me throughout that this and Popper have been Taleb's most significant influences.e between a Magician and a Mathematician, a storyteller and codewarrior.

B000CNEO1G|5.0|Of course you can only go wrong with Bach when playing is suspect or the sound quality is bad.    Neither are issues here as Balsom plays with technical command and beautiful phrasings.

I'm not familiar with many other trumpet interpretations of these pieces, so the CD is an excellent addition to the catalog.

006112429X|5.0|I had read a lot of Amazon reviews of We Need to Talk About Kevin in trying to decide whether or not to buy it, and the majority of the reviews (even if they were positive) talked about their open disdain for the narrator, Eva. So starting the book I had a preconceived notion that I wouldn't like Eva and might find it difficult to read from her perspective. So in reading it, I really related to her and felt for her from the beginning. I kept waiting to get to that part in the book where I didn't like her, but it never came. I didn't like her choices and could not understand for the life of me why she did the things she did, but I always felt like she was a sympathetic character. As a woman who has always questioned whether or not to have children, I understand how that essential question can loom over you and how there is no easy answer to it. I did relate to many of her ten reasons for not wanting to have children (including less time for the two of us, social demotion and dementing boredom), but even moreso applauded her bravery for spelling out her feelings against having kids. In our society, that is not always an easy thing for women to do. It is generally accepted that all happily married women will have kids and to go against the social grain and defiantly say that you do not want children is generally regarded as selfish and against nature. Once she did have Kevin, it didn't go as smoothly as the diaper commercials would have us to believe. She questioned whether or not she did the right thing in having him, she didn't fall in love with him instantly, and the maternal feelings didn't kick in as easily as portrayed. Again, this isn't something that we talk about in our culture. We are lead to believe the baby is born, you immediately fall in love with him or her, you go home and live happily ever after. You are happy to give up the life you had before the baby, and in some respects, give up yourself because you are a mother. And that title outranks all others before it.<br /><br />I also felt that this book did a good job of being open to all possibilities. We try to answer the question \\"why\\", when there is no reason or there are multiple reasons. Kevin wasn't just some kid who was picked on and harassed daily, he was often the aggressor. He did not become a mass murder because his mom was cold and distant or because he had a lousy childhood. He did not do it because he listened to heavy metal music and played violent video games. The book was honest and true and didn't try to force an answer to the why question. It really forces you to look at things from many angles and think about those deep questions we'd rather not think about. This novel offers no answers. As there really are not a lot of answers to be found in these situations.<br /><br />It also leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Why would Eva stay in such a horrible situation? Why would she continue to visit her son in prison and accept him into her home? And to be honest, the characters were pretty black and white. Kevin was all evil, only becoming a slightly round character at the end of the novel. Eva was always perceptive, yet detached. Franklin was the blind idiot, blindly following his American dream into tragedy. Other than wishing for more rounded characters, her writing was superb.

1400063515|4.0|I am in the field of psychology and found much of interest here.  Taleb's writing about logical fallacies which ALL humans tend to make about the information presented to them was spot on.  I have taken some basic courses in statistics (geared towards psychology, of course) and was generally able to understand his points about the bell curve and outliers and his \\"black swan\\" concept.  His off-hand style of writing did not bother me in the least (I know it has bothered others), in fact the conversational tone of his writing made it seem much more personal and heartfelt.  I suppose my main reservation would be that the book seemed a bit repetitive...after a few hundred pages, he seemed to be making the same point over and over again and was not adding anything new to the discussion.  This is a minor shortcoming though, and I thought it was a really nice touch that at the end, he thanked the reader for reading his book.  I freely admit I have no business background and yet I was able to understand and relate to much of this book; I found the book to be much more of a philosophy essay as opposed to a business primer.  Recommended, but a bit repetitive (perhaps I should go back and read his first book, which people have said is excellent).

0316067598|2.0|The story of 20 dead SEALs and US Special Forces in the service of their country should be known to every American.  But I'll wager that few people in this country know about this story, and that's a sad commentary of the Afghan war. That said, while Leading Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell is true patriotic sailor, he is not much of a storyteller, and less of a writer. He tells the story of the ill-conceived and botched Intel operation into the Afghan mountains, Operation Redwing. His story is filled with so many contradictions and half-baked political opinions, that it made the read almost an unbearable distraction. What's worse, he comes off sounding like an Ugly American. In Tom Clancy's \\"Shadow Warriors: Inside The Special Forces\\", Clancy describes how the US Army Special Forces work closely with the indigenous people to form a local resistance force, and they try to win their hearts and minds. It seems that the SEALs have no such training and clearly no such intention.     Like most of the military, LPO Luttrell is a stanch conservative. That's fine and understandable. He vows his undying loyalty to the United States of America, and to the Commander in Chief, as long as the Commander in Chief is George W. Bush. However, when he blames the deaths of his fellow SEALs on the liberal media, these rants become truly absurd. He comes from a SEAL culture of teamwork, never leave a fellow SEAL behind, and never leave your swim buddy. One wonders if much of this anti-liberal vitriol is not misplaced survivor's guilt. He needs to get his facts straight. It wasn't the so-called liberal media that put in the Rules of Engagement, (ROE), it was George Bush, Dick Chaney, and Don Rumsfeld. These policies he whines about come from a conservative White House, Congress, and Pentagon. He should think through the entire circumstance that brought him to that mountain top, then he can spout off about how the liberals that have ruined the war, the military, and this country.    **WARNING SOILERS**    The author makes it clear he has no respect for the Afghan people. He repeated ad nauseam how the Afghan and Arab people stared at him with burning hatred.  It appears his Rules of Engagement (ROE) would be \\"kill them all and let God sort them out.\\" This hackneyed John Wayne bravado went out in the 1950s.  Obviously we can't kill them all, that tactic hasn't been used in the last 5 wars we've fought, so get over it. He drones on about how he might be charged for murder if he happens to kill a few unarmed Afghan civilians, when they're all just terrorists anyway and they deserve killing. Well, they're not all Talaban or al Qaeda. He laments that we can't fight the terrorists on their terms. He declares if we fought in their ruthless manner and quit worrying whether everyone still loved us, then we'd win the war in about a week. Would we?  You can't destroy the village to save the village. Most of the population are just farmers, and most don't have TNT in the packs on their camels. That is of little concern for LPO Luttrell. He seems to feel that if he happens to kill a few innocents, it's just  \\"his bad\\"; they'll say \\"sorry\\" to the families later.  What he forgets in these xenophobic rants is it was these very Afghan farmers who saved his life and risked the lives of an entire village to do so.        Some of the writing is truly second rate; they clearly needed a much better ghostwriter.  You really don't get to know his fellow SEALs well. You know they were really great guys with beautiful wives and fiancés, but he skims over the surface of the true persons. There is no real description of the unit camaraderie or real insight into who they were. What's really embarrassing is some of the writing. When he describes how a fellow SEAL is fighting for his life and finally gets his head blown off, the best he can come up with to eulogize him was \\"what a guy.\\" What a guy?     Finally, this is an important story and it deserves to be told.  It simply needed a better storyteller.  It needed a writer who sounds less like Glenn Beck and more of a reasoned, intelligent, and introspective USN SEAL.
B000Q67DEO|5.0|Conceptually, this original Video Album was ahead of its time, and it still holds up today as do the production values. Back then, almost no one was doing videos, and those who did were not into complicated story lines and complex Hollywood-style approaches like present videos. Bands like Blondie were performers, and here they prove that they could - and can - rock better than the best of them. Debbie Harry and Clem Burke (who agrees with me that Clem is one of the most underrated drummers in rock history??) are definitely self-aware and in the moment while Nigel Harrison & Frank Infante might seem a bit awkward what the what and why they are doing this. That's okay, because every video is both a fun and a pleasure to watch, especially the color, graffitti-laden \\"The Hardest Part\\" and the on-location \\"Union City Blues.\\" Check out both audience and band alike breaking loose in the title track and \\"Dreaming.\\" Blondie fans should welcome this arrival.
1593072937|5.0|Frank Miller starts his Sin City series off with a bang.  Marv is probably the best anti-hero since Dirty Harry.  His sense of justice is rough and his means of enforcing it is rougher.  And watching it play out makes THE HARD GOODBYE an excellent introduction to these books.    Marv is not the most introspective man around.  He is as psychologically troubled in his everyday life as he is psychologically untroubled by his use of violence to help and avenge those he deems to be worthy of such.  In THE HARD GOODBYE, he focuses his attention on Goldie, the only woman to ever show him the slightest bit of solace.  After she winds up dead, Marv has no other purpose but to find and kill those responsible.  Woe to those who get in the way.    Though not the sharpest crayon in the box, Marv nonetheless shows more smarts than many would give him credit for.  His ensnaring of Kevin, a truly scary character, demonstrates an ability to plan things out in detail when necessary to accomplish his goals.  If Marv lacks subtlety, it is most likely because, well, he does not need it.      THE HARD GOODBYE sets the tone for the rest of the Sin City catalog.  The action and characters are usually as black and white as the art.  The characters are often archetypes and it is to Frank Miller's credit that they do not become stereotypical.  It may not be the most intellectual of reading, but for those times you just want the action, these books fit the bill.
B000002OMN|5.0|I love this CD.  I had the tape and listened to it until it wouldn't play any more.  The song content may not be appropriate for kids but the beat and the melody I think out weigh the content if you are an adult.

B0001I562I|5.0|This is one of those movies where you finish watching it and think, \\"Why in the world wasn't this more popular?\\" The basic plotline is this: David Freeman, a typical 12-year-old from 1978, is rendered unconcious in an accident. When he wakes up, he finds that he has somehow been transported to 1986 without aging at all. A spaceship who's mission is to study different races throughout the universe turns out to be the culprit, and the two embark on a journey to get David home.  The movie is charming and funny, with knock-your-socks-off music provided by Alan Silvestri. It's a film for fans of Disney and/or the '80s. It's been a family favorite for us for as long as I can remember. Only caution: almost every swear word in the book is used once in the movie. I realize that doesn't faze most people nowadays, but I still feel obligated to mention it.  The fact that Disney plans to remake this is sacreligious. I vote we all boycott it when it comes out and instead demand a re-release of the original. This is a hidden gem that everyone should have in their movie collection.

0743496728|5.0|I'm happy to say Jodi Picoult is back. After being disappointed in her last two books, \\"The Tenth Circle\\"  and \\"Vanishing Acts,\\" I didn't think she was going to ever be able to keep up the compelling storytelling she's accomplished in the past.  My favorite still remains \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" although she has done a fine job with \\"Nineteen Minutes.\\"    Nineteen minutes is the time it took 17 year old Peter Houghton to destroy lives and property in a school shooting reminiscent of the Columbine shooting. A feat which, obviously, should make one despise this character. Yet, what I really like about Jodi Picoult's books, is the fact that she makes it so easy for the reader to sympathize with the \\"bad guy\\" and see both sides of the issue.     I especially liked the journal entries at the beginnings of some paragraphs. They felt so real, so intimate, as if I were really intruding on the privacy of the owner. The construction of the book, with past and present events intermingling kept me intrigued, and especially the fact that the four main characters, mother and daughter, and mother and son, were once friends.  I found all four characters well developed and engaging. What tore those friendships apart, and what caused this tragic event to happen kept me reading until the wee hours of the morning.    Some have criticized Ms. Picoult for churning out novels which seem formulaic. I don't find them to be. Oh, yes, there does always seem to be a trial at the end. But she obviously does a tremendous amount of research on her many varied subjects, she handles difficult problems for teenagers (since she has three of her own), and she tackles both sides of the issue. Having known several bullied teens and middle schoolers, I found this novel both realistic and a gripping read. I would have to admit that I did find the twist at the end a bit unrealistic. Or perhaps I was just unprepared for it.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|This is the best of His best early cuts.  It belongs in every rock collection.
0316067598|4.0|This book proves that America still produces heroes and that truth is wilder than the imagination of any writer of fiction.  The account of SEAL Team 10's final firefight against overwhelming odds and Marcus Luttrell's survival ordeal should be an inspiration to us all and assist us in understanding the nature of our enemies (and allies) in the War on Terror--but even more importantly, to assist us in understanding the incredible courage, skill, devotion, and persistence of America's fighting elite in the face of criticism and critical scrutiny at home and in the face of extremely hostile terrain and a rabid enemy in the mountains of northeastern Afghanistan.    The only objection I have is to the overly long portion of the book devoted to SEAL training, in particular, Marcus Luttrell's.  While it is vital to understand the SEAL culture in order to comprehend the amazing fortitude of Luttrell and his team in action, that portion of the book was a bit tedious.  Otherwise, this account of American heroism is one for the ages.
B00001QGPS|5.0|I'll admit that I didnt want to check out any collabo albums after hearing The Firm but since I like Redman and Method Man , I gave it a shot and its straight fire. The albums starts of with Blackout! as the two work their magic on the mic. They keep things moving with the equally hot Mi Casa and their second single Y.O.U. The first single Tear It Off(which is also on the In Too Deep soundtrack) was great and that video still makes me laugh till this day. LL Cool J and Ja Rule join in on 4 Seasons and I must say that that was the best verse I've heard from LL in a while. Da Rockwilder is cool but they should have made it longer. I dont usually like edited songs but Maaad Crew will get a some listens from me. The only songs I didnt feel is Mic Cheka(butchers the old Das Efx classic) and Fire Ina Hole. The rest of this album is exceptional. Bottom Line: Red And Meth's Blackout! is the best rap collaboration album of all time. The beats were superb, the rhymes were on point and the guests were not too shabby themselves. Standout Tracks: BLACKOUT!, MI CASA, Y.O.U., 4 SEASONS, TEAR IT OFF, DA EOCKWILDER, DATS DA S*** RUN FOR COVER, CEREAL KILLER, HOW HIGH REMIX(off The Show soundtrack), 1,2, 1,2, WELL ALL RITE CHA(off Doc's Da Name) and  BIG DOGS(off Judgement Day).

159562015X|4.0|interesting book, loved the concept, etc etc. The thing I don't like about this is that everyone has to buy a copy in order to get anything out of the book. My kids, their friends & I have spent good times with personality tests, Myers-Briggs especially. If everyone who we wanted to talk to about this could just take a test, we would have ended up big fans. Most of their friends ended up buying 'please understand me' anyways, wanting to find out more about their own & friends' personalities. But with this book we never got a chance to really get into it. It just feels like a money-making ploy to me.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I really liked \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\" with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in the famous roles of \\"Dr. Hannibal Lecter\\" and \\"Agent Clarice Starling\\". The characters and the lines were penned out great, and it was also directed very well, which ultimately led it to win best picture as well as several other academy awards.       However, the sequel is still good, but it is a little bit dissapointing. Hannibal has escaped and he is living in Italy. Ever since the last time, Clarice Starling encountered Hannibal, he has in a way cast a spell on her. She comments saying(\\"I think about him for 30 seconds every day\\"). She isn't doing so well, she is asked to take time off from her job of being a cop, mainly because Clarice messed up an investigation. Hannibal is still living his life, he is very interested in art and he does teach a seminar to other people.       However, his moves have not flawed at all. He still has hunger to kill and eat people. A man who is in a wheelchair, desperately wants to catch Hannibal, mainly because he caused him to have a disfigured face. The story goes on and on, finally Hannibal decides to come out of his shell and he arrives in America.     Before, I continue. I must inform you that Jodie Foster, although she seemed interested in the beginning to reprise her role, she turned it down and gave various reasons. She was apparently concerned about how the character was going to be depicted in the sequel, after she read the book, and after she learned that Jonathan Demme, would not return to direct the film. Julianne Moore beat out several other actresses including Ashley Judd and Helen Hunt to the role after several auditions. I felt that she wasn't that convincing to begin with. The character, as Foster feared was not depicted well.     There is a lot of violence, that creates the fear allusion and leads up to its climatic ending. It is a good sequel.
0143036742|3.0|I was clearly supposed to really like this book. A very good friend gave me my copy. I arrived at my sister's house to find that she had set it aside for me. And I did like it-- well enough, I guess. I didn't love it, and despite the billing as comedy I didn't find it very funny.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about the book is its observations about the experience of families who have gone through very difficult times. The relationship between the sisters was particularly well-done. There's something about how shared experiences can be lived so differently which is rarely handled well in books about siblings-- particularly sisters.<br /><br />Their father, Nikolai, is more painful than funny. His stubbornness and his childishness will hit rather close to home for anyone who has had to deal with an aging and ill parent. His marriage to the bombshell Valentina is appropriately catastrophic.<br /><br />All in all, even though there were parts of the novel which I liked a great deal, I would tend to side with the readers that it would have made a stronger short story than it did a novel. The memories of the past would have been stronger had they been hinted at or implied, and frankly the strength of the novel is in its present. I found myself singularly uninterested in the book within a book which was clearly supposed to provide much of the emotional depth.<br /><br />Not a bad read, not a great one.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|Jesus, at what point in the numerous beige-walled hollywood boardroom meetings over this little-genius script did NO-ONE BOTHER TO MENTION THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEIT OF THE STORY IS F*&$ing S!?@TING COMPLETE F?*$!ING BASELESS.    No, not the forgiveable voiceover gimmick comedy source.  But the author's story itself!    So we have dustin hoffman's professor of literature wringing his hands, emma thompson going all pre-menstrual as a genius writer and Ferrell's character ready to kill himself for one thing: a story about a taxman who falls in love with a cookie woman and then, in a completely unrelated tangent of action - saves a little punk on a bike from getting Greyhound-pancaked??? THAT'S THE STORY THAT'S GONNA CHANGE MODERN LITERATURE!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH....ad infinitum.    Can't you just picture it now: all those high-tower downtown LA suits putting on the chinese-whispers...\\"ITS TRUMAN MEETS CAPOTE\\". Or something - i can't even be bothered to think of something clever now...thats how numb its made me.    But there's a funny line where Ferrell pretends to be someone's brother's boyfriend.  And Maggie G looks super-hot with that left arm china tattoo.    Otherwise a complete waste of talent.  Unless you're one of the above 200 morons who can't differentiate a baseless script from an intact one.    audi.

Think of all the leisure time, satisfaction, and fun we will have!  This is a fun read with an important message. In the style of Blink, the author shares studies and experiences and theory that all converge on one thing: We are not satisfied because we have to many choices.   Then he provides the anti-dote to being overwhelmed by the information age: \\"Satisficing\\"  This book could save relationships, as well as personal well-being.   I am now on the path to recovery. I am a recovering optimizer and on the way to being a satisficer!

0765316978|5.0|While this is the last of the trilogy that includes \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades,\\" it is not necessary to have read the others to follow and enjoy \\"The Last Colony.\\"<br /><br />Scalzi seamlessly supplies the background as protagonist and narrator John Perry describes the bucolic retirement he and his wife, Jane Sagan, and adopted daughter, Zoe, are about to leave behind.<br /><br />Perry and Sagan are both retired soldiers who gave up their highly modified bodies for ordinary human ones. Or so they believe until the Colonial Union offers them a challenging post establishing up a new planetary colony, Roanoke. New colonies are always a challenge since the heavens are filled with carbon-based species who covet each other's finds.<br /><br />And that is about the only true thing the Colonial Union has told them. Even the planet they're sent to is not the one they prepped for. And Sagan soon realizes she is still very much Special Forces enhanced. And it's not just any rag-tag alien army that's after them. Instead, they are pawns in an interstellar battle of empires.<br /><br />With wry humor and plenty of twists and turns that rely more on mental agility than military might - though there's a sufficiency of battles - Scalzi explores the pitfalls of government duplicity on a grand scale, censorship, ego, xenophobia and more. Never heavy handed, Scalzi provides well-written entertainment that can be enjoyed beyond the boundaries of the genre.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I'm definitely too old to be writing this review. Old enough to know better than to state my real age.    I own 3 of these. They're like potato chips, you can't have just 1. It's true, it's a little on the weak side straight out of the box, but Hasbro was thinking ahead. I suspect it was intentionally designed with the modder in mind because there's not a drop of glue anywhere. Just remove the screws and open the case. Once inside, you only need to add an extra spring. Don't worry about removing the restrictor. You'll get plenty of range with just the spring mod. My favorite source of springs? The dollar store. Buy yourself a toilet paper roll dispenser, remove the spring and insert it in tandem with the stock spring in the piston. Voila, you have 100 ft range. (Tish, that's French!) Okay, maybe not. I never measured, but I know I can shoot from one end of my apartment to the other with a nearly flat trajectory. That's easily 30 ft with virtually no drop. I'm sure you could get it to fly farther with a slight incline. If you need help with the mods, just google \\"nerf mods\\" and you'll find plenty of helpful sites. I don't recommend any in particular, but they're all more or less equivalent.    The most attractive feature, which drew me to it in the first place, is the clip-feed. Yes, it's prone to a bit of jamming if you're not careful. As long as you pull all the way back, and push all the way forward, with a smooth even stroke, you'll have no problems. How well you load the darts into the clips matter too. The common snag point is near the front of the clip so try to load them all the way back so the rear of the dart is flush against the flat surface of the magazine. Do that, and you shouldn't hit any problems. I like to quick cycle through my spares just for fun. I'm generally able to feed through 6 magazines without a jam. It's a shame Nerf doesn't sell spare magazines. Thankfully, they sell spare streamline darts. The extra range makes it very easy to lose darts.    The attachment that goes on the nose of the gun is pretty worthless for anything but spare parts. It's only there to qualify the CS-6's claim as the longest Nerf gun. It appears to add a touch of accuracy, but sacrifices a lot of yardage. I've never tried, but I suspect you could harvest the spring if you crack it open. There's some glue on this one, so you'll need to hack into it.    If you're lucky, you may be able to find the Wal-Mart exclusive package: a Long-shot with all the standard accessories + an exclusive \\"laser\\" sight. Look up Nite-shot if you don't know what I'm talking about.    Hopefully, Hasbro won't detune this model in the future. Nerf products have a tendency to become less potent with successive generations. After 2 or 3 generations, the popular Nite-Shot and Maverick are just shadows of their former glory because of the cheaper and/or thinner material they use.    One final warning for anyone considering modifying this gun. Do not attach the bolt lever until you're finished with your modifications. The big orange knobs on either side that cock and load the darts are designed to go on and stay on. I made the mistake of fully assembling it before deciding to modify. I had to force them apart which stripped some of the plastic inside the knob. If you want to see what the stock gun is capable of, just use the half of the lever that has the rod. This should be enough to draw the spring.    I don't condone modifying your toys. Especially because the final product tends to be a bit overpowered for smaller children. I accept no responsibility for product damage or bodily harm caused by this toy. I also apologize if I've repeated anything the other reviewers said. I honestly did not read more than a handful before I wrote this rant. I mean review.    5 stars for being the most entertaining toy I own, and I own many. Way too many.    3 stars for being a good teaching aide on the basics of Nerf modding.    4 stars for durability. I haven't broken anything yet, but as it goes with abused Nerf toys, something has to give eventually.    5 stars overall. I honestly cannot think of a more entertaining toy. The term toy excludes video games and airsoft.    UPDATE: As things normally go at Nerf HQ, they've watered down the Long-Shot. I recommend the new N-Strike CS-6 Recon which uses the same clip system, but also offers modularity.     UPDATE#2: Two have commented to point out that clips are available for sale separately. They're manufactured in a darker shade of orange and a harder kind of plastic than the ones that came with on my Longshots. These were released with the Recons. The harder plastic makes a louder clack when you aggressively insert them. The older yellower clips are softer so the clack is somewhat dampened.    The release of the CS-35 Raider Rapid Fire introduced the 35 shot drum to the Nerf market. As of now, the drum is not sold separately, but it's just a matter of time. In the meantime, nothing in my arsenal (or anyone else's in the office) beats a Recon with drum.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|It has been several years that Tenacious D fans have been waiting for a new album from The D, and as a fan, this album satisfied my hunger for new content but failed to deliver as a worthy successor to their self-titled debut CD.  The main reason for this is that the album plays much more like a soundtrack (which it is advertised as) rather than a full-blown album.  That being said, this has to be one of my favorite movie soundtracks of all time and still captures the unique sound (and humor) that I love about Jack and Kyle.<br /><br />From the moment the first track \\"Kickapoo\\" begins and you hear the signature D-like acoustic riff, you know your in for a treat as Jack playfully weaves a story about a young JB, rebelling against his father by embracing Rock in a way that only he can (\\"Twas I who f---ed the dragon!\\").  Keep in mind that I first heard this CD before even watching the movie, and the first minute of acoustic guitar combined with Jack Black's aggressive, completely ridiculous lyrics brought such a huge smile to my face that instantly felt the wait for this song alone was worth it.  Vintage Tenacious D.  Meatloaf and Dio also contribute to make the opening so strong that it really is difficult for the rest of the album to maintain the momentum this track brings from beginning to end.<br /><br />\\"Classico\\" is the first of several tracks on the album that pays homage to tunes from the band's past work (same Bach piece Kyle played in \\"Rock Your Socks Off\\" from the first album) while adding a new spin to it.  Many reviewers have complained that some of the songs on this CD are too short to enjoy but this is a great example of one that is just long enough to appreciate - once again, brilliant combination of KG's masterful guitar-playing and JB's over-the-top lyrics (\\"When you rule, you f---in school, all of the fools, out of their jewels).<br /><br />Unlike, \\"Classico\\", \\"Baby\\" is one song I really wish was longer than it turns out to be on the album.  It's a soulful tune that provides just enough harmony and guitar that it might have earned some playtime on the radio if it were fleshed out into a full song, especially when you consider there are no swear words involved.  It's of my favorite songs to sing along to, even if it only lasts barely over a minute.<br /><br />Although \\"Destiny\\" only serves as a transition track with a couple lines from the movie, what's nice about the small snippet is that Jack sings the same short vocal riff that preceded each of the HBO specials, the same one that would play as they entered the open-mike night bar - another treat for hardcore D fans.  This is nicely followed by \\"History\\", another song that longtime D fans would undoubtedly recognize from the HBO specials and other appearances.  This version is slightly extended, with added lines like, \\"We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2, even stopped a moving train\\", and it's nice to finally have a real version to play.<br /><br />\\"The Government Totally Sucks\\" has drawn some comparisons to \\"City Hall\\" from the first album, but I find it to be lacking in their trademark tongue-in-cheek humor, as the music seems a little lazy and repetitive and the lyrics are definitely short on inspiration.  It's no wonder this track was cut from the movie.<br /><br />\\"Master Exploder\\" is, just like \\"Classico\\", just enough Tenacious D brilliance and ridiculousness to warrant repeated playbacks even though it is a short piece.  With lines like \\"I did not mean to blow your mind, but that sh--happens to me all the time!\\", this track is a perfect example of why Tenacious D fans can't get enough of them - if you understand the sarcasm behind their seemingly over-the-top arrogance, you can't help but enjoy them for what they pretend (believe?) to be: the greatest band on earth.<br /><br />\\"Papegenu\\" may seem a little strange if you haven't seen the movie, but once you see the scene you'll understand the meaning behind the weird use of a recorder and lots of dialogue between JB and Sasquatch (hint: mushrooms are involved).  Again, longtime D fans should notice the second half of the song is similar to the one played with Sasquatch in another of the HBO specials.<br /><br />More songs follow along with the movie, with \\"Dude I Totally Miss You\\" describing the duos time apart.  Like \\"Baby\\", it's another soulful song but adds a bit of man-crush humor that is a traditional theme in D songs.  \\"Break-In City\\" and \\"Car Chase City\\" are less Tenacious D, more generic rock and roll.  Although Jack still works his unique styling into the songs, the music doesn't seem typical of something him and KG would perform in a club.<br /><br />This all leads into a climactic battle with the Devil in \\"Beelzeboss\\", and MAN what a climax it is!  JB and Kyle challenge the Devil to a rock-off, and the back-and-forth music and lyrics between the foes turns out to be an awesome rock opera that takes laugh-out-loud humor, hard metal, slow acoustic, and head-banging solos to create by far the best track on the album.  Played with a passionate snarl by Dave Grohl (always a contributor to D songs but never quite like this!), the Devil proves to be a worthy adversary to Jack and Kyle, vocally and stylistically.  This song provides an idea of what really happened in \\"Tribute\\" from their first album.  I cannot get enough of this song and would recommend the album for this track alone.<br /><br />The album finishes off with \\"POD\\", which is a fun recap of the movie that doesn't sound very Tenacious D-like but is still enjoyable, and \\"The Metal\\", which is a bit harder than the Bluesy sound we're used to hearing but, again, is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this album and it came out before the film actually was released, and the best compliment I can give the CD is that the movie did not live up to the soundtrack.  I fell in love with a lot of the songs on the album, but I was disappointed that the scenes in the movie that were accompanied by some of the tracks in this album (mainly \\"Kickapoo\\" and Beelzeboss\\") did not live up to the excitement I felt just listening without a visual to go with the lyrics.  Don't let the below average movie keep you from purchasing this CD, as I promise you that if you give it a chance, Tenacious D's music will invade your mind just like it did mine so many years ago.olved).

B000002P2V|5.0|Is crocked!  This is such an important Who album, it doesn't deserve any negative publicity.  IMHO, this album is #2 behind Who's Next.
0385335989|2.0|Once I started this series, I literally could not put these books down.  I was telling all my friends about these books, staying up too late and going to work with circles under my eyes, but loving the characters, the period detail and the twists and turns of the plot.    Then I came to Drums of Autumn.  This is the first book of Gabaldon's series that I thought was unconvincing and could have used more attention from her editor.  And that's saying something, considering each previous book is 800-1000 pages at least.    Generally I've enjoyed the anticipation leading up to a major plot point (i.e. the first 350 pages of Voyager) because what's been in those pages has been well-paced, exciting and led to a deeper appreciation of the characters.  But in this book, when I got to the part where Brianna has left to find her parents, I said aloud \\"It's about d**n time!\\" and by the end of the book I was skipping pages and pages just to find out what happened.  And the characters started doing things that made no sense.  Eventually between the absurd plot twists and the descriptive passages that just went on and on and on, I got to the point where  found myself talking back to the book (\\"Arggh\\" and \\"You've gotta be kidding!\\" are prime, printable examples) and, alas, losing interest.      Don't get me wrong - there are very riveting and entertaining parts to the book but overall I thought that Gabaldon wasted too much prose on things that didn't further the plot or enhance the characters, only to gloss over areas rife with potential.  What about Brianna's memories of Frank (we only learned that he taught her to shoot - what else did they share?), her time living alone since her mother's departure, her arrival/stay at Lallybroch, her observations of her mother's relationship with Jaime and how she finally resolves her issues regarding her mother's betrayal of Frank?  We hear at the end of the book that she's seen one marriage with love and one marriage without, and would choose love instead of settling.  Really!?!  And what were her observations and thoughts that brought her to this conclusion, anyway??    My other gripe with this book is that that Gabaldon obviously thought up the scenario concerning Roger/Jamie/Steven Bonnet simply find a mechanism by which Brianna and Roger get stranded in the 18th century.  Come on!!  These ploys (mistaken identity, misinterpretation of overheard conversations) are shockingly unoriginal, used in TV sitcoms and by lazy writers who can't think of any other way to get the characters do what they want them to.  I know by her previous examples that she's not lazy and has created characters and stories that while they require a little suspension of disbelief, still worked because they at least seemed plausible and in alignment with what we understood about the characters.  It would have been much more interesting if Gabaldon had developed Brianna into a person whose decisions and actions actually made sense.  Instead of taking stock of her situation and making a well thought out decision, Brianna instead had the decision forced upon her, so to speak, and was turned into a victim.  I suppose my disappointment in this book is so much greater because the author had set the bar so high with her previous entries in the series.    I'll keep plowing ahead and read the remaining two books in the series, but seeing that The Fiery Cross has only a 3-star average rating, I'll continue with much less excitement, afraid that I'll be disappointed again.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Even though the this is a somewhat dated movie, the story is interesting and the adventures of the characters are enough to keep the audience engaged and entertained. Ralph Machio isn't one of the most convincing actors of the time and his pouty face can become a bit annoying, he is really the only downfall of the movie. I gave it four stars as the story is excellent, the music is entertaining and most of the acting is reasonably good.
0316067598|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end.  I have a huge amount of respect for Marcus Luttrell, The SEALs, and the military.  I'm glad there are men like him out there.  I'm glad Luttrell is on our side!  This is a great book for readers and non-readers alike.  It's a true, fast-paced, emotional story that makes me so proud to be American!  I might caution young readers for some adult language.
B000PWQPAC|4.0|My copy freezes at 07 seconds into Chapter 15 then jumps to 46 seconds later. If one watches the timer, one will see it did more then freeze. After it freezes you can back up to 8 seconds into Chapter 15 and continue. A few small things do happen in the during the jump. We checked out 4 copies and all were bad.  As for the movie , I am a big fan of Ghost in a Shell and love them all. And as for one reviewer, it is dubbed into English by them same crew.
B000002GWN|5.0|I don't really understand the critism os the band here.  Yes, 30 years later, it sounds cheesy in parts, but remember that they were representing a sound at that time.  And remember that this is essentially the same band that just months later went on to make Court and Spark w/ Joni.  Plus this is not a studio album - of course they are going to try to dress up the songs a little bit.    I own almost all of the Joni albums and this totally worth getting.    - Z
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Snakes & Arrows is the first Rush studo album/CD I have thoroughly dissected since Counterparts in '93, so I can't compare it to more recent releases like Vapor Trails and Test for Echo. That said, I'm finding Snakes & Arrows to be a very solid, introspective body of work. I will say it took five spins through before 'getting it'...but that's typical of any album/CD from an artist like Rush where you expect at least 7-8 great tracks off each one.   The first album I ever listened to was Power Windows in '85, and frankly, it took about five spins through before I liked every track. Rush will never be able to match their catalog pre-Signals because that's just not possible. 'Feedback' from '04 was as close to the early days as you're going to hear in terms of raw guitar rock.   My favorite albums are the standard classics that 99% of Rush fans love - 2112, Hemispheres, Moving Pix, PermWaves, etc. S&A is probably somewhere in the middle in terms of all-time impact, but like I said, it was a worthy purchase. Also, part of my decision to 'geek out' or 'invest' a bunch of time into this album is due to the fact that Rush is playing 9 songs off S&A on their current tour, and I want to 'know' the music when they roll through Salt Lake on August 6th. Without question a concert is better if you know the music!  IMO - All-Time Ranking of Rush Albums:  1. 2112  2. Hemispheres  3. Moving Pictures  4. Permanent Waves  5. Farewell to Kings  6. Fly By Night  7. Caress of Steel  8. Power Windows  9. Counterparts  10. Rush  11. Signals  12. Snakes & Arrows  13. Roll the Bones  14. Hold Your Fire  15. Grace Under Pressure  16. Test for Echo  17. Vapor Trails  18. Presto
B000HA4WT8|1.0|Let's face it, this entire movie is a fantasy. It is basically an MTV video about fancy underground car racing or a \\"Need for Speed\\" movie version.     What did I learn from this movie? well, just because I like to play video-games of this genre, I may not necessarily like watching a movie about it. Don't get me wrong, I have 14-18 year old nephews that love this type of movie due to the cars and of course, the girls. This is why I took them to see it. They of course love it, that is why they have the DVDs and watch it again and again.     The story line, young underestimated underground racer makes move on girlfriend of nince's kingpin, kingpin challenge to race, both make a mess on the way, and he ends up deported to Tokyo, where he practically does the same thing. Of course, he meets his \\"sen say\\" and ends up becoming kingpin at the end of movie.    They are no surprises, you watch this movie because you enjoy watching stunts, girls and cars. It's all about image, and the movie is an entire facade.      My issue with this movie is not that it wasn't meant for me, is that it was meant for lets face it, teenagers, and the message that is being set about value and women, etc. is pretty empty, vain, superficial. Particularly since they tend to watch these movies over and over.    I don't know, maybe I am getting old. Then again, I loved Batman begins. So, Maybe I just like movies with substance.

0618680004|5.0|Some individuals, including a few of his peers, regard Dawkins as arrogant or militant in his Atheism. I disagree. I feel that Dawkins is instead, quite matter of fact about the subject and rather than being militant, he is exquisitely passionate in his Atheism. This book is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time and I would wholeheartedly recommend it. Dawkins sets a pretty high goal in his book that: \\"If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down.\\" I don't know if Dawkins will convince any Bible thumpers to jump ship..(or Koran thumpers for that matter)..but his book is an excellent compilation of thorough and reasoned arguments that are backed up by scientifically accepted evidence. And it should, at the very least, cause any reasonable person to ponder the thought, for a moment, that there just might not be a God. If you are devoutly religious and refuse to accept any argument contrary to your beliefs then you should avoid this book. But for the open-minded...it will make for a riveting read that you'll hardly be able to put down. And, just perhaps, Dawkins may accomplish his goal with at least a few of his readers.
0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor brought to mind another personal favorite from the history/adventure genre, We Die Alone, by Howarth.  But where We Die Alone is a protracted story of extraordinary suffering and perseverance, Lone Survivor occurs over the course of a few days, during which Luttrell, a Navy SEAL, overcomes nearly unfathomable mental and physical hardship: he kills and nearly gets killed, he finds himself completely alone as he is shot, breaks bones, loses almost forty pounds, and looks into the Taliban's hateful eyes.  Incredibly, like Balsraad in We Die Alone, he finds friendship and support where fierce enemies more commonly lurk; one man's incredible sacrifice is soon shared by many.    I was lucky to have read Lone Survivor soon after I read Deep Survival, in which the author Gonzales explains why some live while others die amid the most trying circumstances.  According to Gonzales, \\"Survival starts before the accident.\\"  Luttrell and Robinson go to great lengths to convey the training regimen of a would-be SEAL.  This training wipes out all but the toughest people, of which Luttrell's story confirms unequivocally he is one.  Throughout the ordeal, Luttrell maintains a spirit and attitude so unbending, I found myself feeling that I personally can stand to muster more toughness and resolve as I face my own life's challenges, meager by comparison.    While Lone Survivor's writing is perhaps less formal than that of We Die Alone, its style is effective and funny.  Writing the book must have been a somber return to a deeply saddening ordeal for Luttrell; however, his language suggests he may also have had fun in the process.  \\"Trying to follow a great 230-pound hulk like myself, slipping and sliding, crashing and breaking branches causing minor avalanches on the loose ground - I must have been an Afghan tracker's dream.\\"  A warrior trained to fight with precision and fierceness, Luttrell also seems a person of great humility, as eager to entertain as to protect.  WhileI laughed at these points and others, just as often I found myself deeply saddened at the loss of some of America's finest and grateful that we are protected by men of such caliber.

0385512104|1.0|This book is as dead as the dog. It is filled to the brim with random facts that don't progress the story at all, and make you frustrated as you try to see the link. This book has the feeling it was written by a very intelligent 3rd grader. Your reading about a dead dog when suddenly the writer starts going on about how the stars exploded in the big bang.     This book is given such good ratings because everyone wants to be politically correct and not be mean to the mentally challenged writer.

0930289234|5.0|If you're the kind of person who thinks comic books are for kids, you're like most people who missed one of the most significant literary releases of the 1980's.<br /><br />Alan Moore's Watchmen is a classic among graphic novels. Originally published in 12 issues from 1986 to 1987 by DC Comics, it's now available in its entirety as a trade paperback.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of superheroes who have (mostly) retired from heroics and find themselves dealing with life without the mask while the world crumbles around them. Watchmen takes place in the fall of 1985, although it is a 1985 with a partially different past. In the world that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons have created, superheroes first show up after World War II. That's where things start to get a little different. In their world of superheroes the Vietnam War is won due to their influence, and technology takes a leap forward due to the advanced mind of one of these heroes.<br /><br />The value of the story isn't invested solely in its artwork, unlike many comics out there, but rather the chapters are broken up by two or three pages of nothing but text. This is presented in the form of excerpts from different fictional non-fiction books--such as an autobiography of a character or 0police reports--many of which blatantly examine the work as a whole and reveal insightful details about the characters.<br /><br />On the surface this is a story about superheroes. But it isn't deeds or super powers that are the hallmark of these characters, but rather it is who they are. Who are these people that dress up in costumes and fight crime? (It all sounds silly when you say it out loud.)<br /><br />But the people behind the masks, what motivates them? Just because a person fights crime, is he good? The Comedian fights crime, but beneath that shallow façade is a blood-thirsty sociopath, just as likely to rape or murder as he is to crack a joke. Rorschach is another interesting case. He fights crime with amask distinctly reminiscent to a psychologist's ink blot. A criminal might not need to be thrown down an elevator shaft to punish crime, but according to Rorschach it can't hurt.<br /><br />The setting of the Watchmen sometimes feels a bit removed since it happens within the context of an America in the midst of a Cold War with the Soviet Union in the fall of 1985. Thanks in large part to the newly emergent superheroes, history has been rewritten: The Vietnam War was a successful operation.<br /><br />The setting is gritty and real, aside from the alternative history aspects that is. The artist does an excellent job of creating the look of a traditional comic but infused with a dose of concrete reality. The city is used and dirty, bars are dank holes you can almost smell, and back alleys are dark and ominous.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's vision of this world, tensions start to rise years before the thread of the story even begins. By 1977, in Moore's chronology, all \\"superheroes\\" are either forced into retirement or work for the government. Those who chose to continue to operate are categorized as fugitives and vigilantes. When former superheroes start getting murdered, those who are left must navigate a morally ambiguous path to a shocking (and surprisingly deep) philosophical conclusion about the price to be paid for saving the human race from itself.
0060977493|4.0|I want to start out by saying that I never put a book down.  I always finish them.  This was one of those books that I thought about putting down, but decided to keep on going.  It was defiantly worth finishing because I ended up enjoying it very much.    On reason why I wanted to put this book down was because I found it frustrating at first to read.  I am a seasoned reader that reads quite a bit, but I thought that the author jumped around too much between stories, characters, and most importantly past and present.  At first this may be confusing but after a lot of pages and you get the sense for the characters and time periods you get use to it.  This was confusing at first because it would jump around from paragraph to paragraph, but after looking at the book as a whole the author did this to develop the story.    By time I got to the last 100 or so pages I could not put this story down.  This is when everything starts to come together and what makes it all and all a great story.  I admit it is frustrating reading the story about the secret with tons of foreshadowing that already happened.  It almost makes you feel like you missed something while reading it, but once you get to those final pages everything starts to come together.      I am going to give this book, 4 stars.  The reason for this is because I thought it was a great story that really came together the last 100 or so pages, but at times before that it was frustrating to read because of the authors writing style and jumping around so much early on.    All and all I would recommend this book to everyone because it poses many interesting issues and ultimately is a great story.  If you feel like putting it down I would tell you to keep on reading because everything will eventually come together and make a great story.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|Filmed outside in widescreen before 20,000 fans who gathered along the steep hollow of western Berlin's famous Waldbühne amphitheatre on July 7, 2006, this live concert, featuring Plácido Domingo, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón is a photogenic spectacle to behold and a musically thrilling experience for those who not only enjoy opera, but enjoy the best of opera rolled into nearly two hours of familiar melodies, one after the other. As a technical achievement, this DVD is a high quality offering for those who like the \\"you are there\\" feel of a live performance - large crowds, a colorful stage, beautiful scenic vistas and panoramic sweeps of an appreciative audience gathered to witness a true operatic event. This DVD has it all: clear and resonant digital sound, crisp, colorful video, and smart cinematography. The sun sets and the mood changes at just about mid-point, when the orchestra under the direction of Marco Armiliato begins the Intermezzo of Mascagni's \\"Cavalleria rusticana\\" The intimacy of this show that existed from the opening overture of Verdi's \\"Nabucco\\" got even more intimate when the stage lights came on and the richness and color of the stage grew even more pronounced when lit against a stygian sky. As for the performances, a gray bearded, mature 65-year old Domingo still has the voice and the star appeal, such that even when the younger Netrebko and Villazon shared the stage, it was Domingo who was the center of attention, and who was most attuned to the tempo of the orchestra and the lead given by Armiliato. Both Villazon and Netrebko were each on at least one occasion following their own lead out in front of the orchestra and its conductor. I've heard that Ms. Netrebko has done this in the past. Well, she did it here, too; bad form, really bad form for a DIVA. Still, this is a spectacular DVD and a good one to show friends who wonder what the lure is all about.

1582701709|4.0|I love how some reviewers give poor ratings when they haven't even read the entire book.......amazing!!!  So I will start w/the fact that I haven't read the book but saw the movie/dvd and loved it.  Basically the point \\"The Secret\\" is trying to get across is:  1. positive thinking  2. acting on it  If you want to be rich then do things to make you rich.  If you want to change your life then do things to change your life.  For example, don't say \\"I want to lose weight\\" and then sit around and eat chips all day.  It's not rocket science people.  Positive thinking will lead you to positive actions.  Positive actions will lead you to positive things happening to you.  And yes I will agree w/some of the other reviewers; we do not attract rape, death, etc....  Things do happen.  If we lose a loved one I do not believe that we asked for or attracted that to happen.  All in all, \\"the secret\\" is a wonderful thing and will cause you to re-evalutate your life.  And again, take it w/a grain of salt.

B000E6EGXM|1.0|This remaster of Britten's 1962 \\"War Requiem\\" is flawless in its technical reproduction and a fine example of this style of orchestration and voice. When it was first performed at Coventry Cathedral on May 30, 1962, it became an immediate critical and (curiously) popular success. What were they thinking? Like so much else in this style, the story told here by soloists and chorus is supposed to build an emotional attachment between the listener and the composer, transferable to the characters caught in the horror of war and more particularly, in this case, of man's reckoning with his maker at the end of time. What makes this 2-CD offering so disagreeable is Britten's inability to write music that is even tolerable. I can't think of a soul who enjoys opera or classical music that would sit for three minutes and slug their way through the torture that Britten writes here. It is typical Britten style, the best of which can be said is this: if you like, discordant, non-melodic, somewhat atonal music, this is your cup of tea. If you expect or hope for even a moment here and the hints of a melody that can inspire or soothe (something which the libretto suggest may be in store), this is not the CD for you. Britten is not the worst twentieth century composer; he is merely one of the worst. With that said, there's little more to add. If you liked the equally horrible \\"Death in Venice\\", you will like this. Otherwise, stay clear; the music is grating and discordant and lacking in any melodic saving grace. A review from OperaOnline.us.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I doubt any viewer can legitimately criticize the acting, cinematography, score, etc. of this film.  They are superb, and I regret never having seen it in a movie theater.    The sticking point with the love it/hate it crowd is the actual storyline, or plot.  I found many reviews overlook the fact that the deeply faceted love stories revolve around involutary choices.  The characters helplessly succumb to their \\"organs of fire\\", their hearts, just as they helplessly suffer when their loves are lost.  It is the background of WWII, though, that makes the story so rich.  The film is so long because it shows how many fates are affected and sacrificed in the name of one love during a time of war.  The ending is beautiful because even the bitterest characters realize theirs is not the only pain.  You might say all's _unfair_ in love and war.  So if you like stories that are about emotions and beauty, you may love this film as I do.  But don't expect a patriotic war movie with the ending wrapped in a neat moral message.  There are no heroes in this story, just victims.
0140177396|4.0|this novel is just great and emotional.  The ending is what makes the book great, its undescrible, because you can feel somehow that the whole story is real life. it is a tragedy.
0316067598|4.0|THO I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK YET, I FOUND IT FASCINATING. I HAD NO IDEA THAT THESE SPECIAL FORCES HAD SUCH WONDERFUL QUALITIES AND SKILLS. WE OWE THEM A GREAT DEAL OF GRATITUDE AND NEED TO KEEP THEM IN OUR PRAYERS.
0340822783|5.0|Even after finishing the book I have a hard time telling friends what it's about.  Too many details spoil the plot - suffice to say the individual six tales are subtly connected, though inherently separate, both in voice and substance.  Perhaps the underlying message is that on one level or another, we are connected to the past and future of humanity.      The book demands a lot of its reader: we are asked to step inside the lives of very different personalities, via extremely different styles of writing.  If you didn't like reading classic lit in school, or can't buy into sci-fi, you may have a problem with the overall story.  It bothered me (in a good way) to be torn away from a character I'd just come to love, only to have to start over again with a new tale.  Thankfully all stories are excellently told, and indirectly connected by the end (if you've read Stephen King's Dark Tower series and recognized the referrences to his other stories, then you get a rough idea of how these six tales are intertwined).    I particularly enjoyed the social commentary on a wide scale of subjects (from old age to potential downsides to consumer greed).  My only criticism is that I would have loved to learn even more about some characters' fates.  But perhaps that is the book's very charm, that it leaves you wanting more.  It's definitely turned me on to Mitchell's other work.
0007107927|2.0|This book is too simple to be really effective. So what if you are a tough or nice manager? This book is basically trying to find a balance, and that's nothing new. And it tell you to evaluate your performance with your goals, thanks for the insight, wow, I've learned so much.  Save your money and time. If you must, check it out at the library.

B000JLTRKE|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  It failed to capture the emotion of  9/11 in my opinion.  The only portion that actually gave me a twinge of remembrance was when the stretchers were lifted out and handed down the long row of rescue workers.  I do like that it recognized the often overlooked sacrifices of the PAPD and I thought the woman who played Jimeno's wife did a fabulous job.  Other than that, I could have slept through most of the movie. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing for me.      If you want something that really captures the emotion of that day, try United 93 instead.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is a wonderful version of a wonderful movie.  It is beautifully restored and is crisp as a Fall day in Iowa.
B000002G6J|5.0|Upon receiving this cd and reading the credits and its date of production, I was in complete amazement!  This album was recorded in 1967. I was 12 years old, I am now, well let's skip this part. I can only say one thing,this man was a musical composing genius! I will continue to add more Jobim to my musical library. For human beings that appreciate musical art and play an instrument, this is something special and worthwhile to purchase to furthur enhance musical appreciation from all parts of our world! For me as a songwriter, composer this has been an important lesson in expanding my abilities as a writer. His magical ability with major 7th chords and variations and combinations, has furthered my abilities. And of course, including the fact that I love brazilian jazz and samba. This has been extremely beneficial and advanced my composing techniques!
B000P0J0G0|5.0|In retrospect this DVD collection is the purchase I wish I had made. Having shelled out for all 4 series of 'A Bit of Fry & Laurie' individually, each one more hilarious than the last, I recommend that comedy fans simply invest in this 4 in 1 pack.    Throughout these fantastic series, Stephen Fry's wit and Hugh Laurie's whimsy never fail to hit the spot. The pairing like to mock everything that the eighties held dear including ruthless black hearted capitalism, vulgar fashion sense and the incumbent Tory government. Allied to the ruthless satire is the pair's amusing habit of toying with and manipulating the English language in a hilarious manner. Far from trying to escape their upper class, Oxbridge backgrounds, they instead choose to embrace them as fully as possible.    Many American viewers will have come to Hugh Laurie through his part in the series 'House' and possibly could have come to Stephen Fry through the part he played in the American series 'Bones'. To these Americans I say that it is an absolute must for you to look through all the past works of these two comic masters. As well as this series check out 'Jeeves & Wooster', 'Blackadder' and the many books that Stephen Fry has published. As far as this series goes, don't hesitate, make this all in one box set your one 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie' purchase.
0393061310|5.0|Diamond's book provides a compeling, scientific theory of how cultures evolve and how isolation and material disadvantage has set some peoples at a disadvantage to the Eurasian peoples.  The fact that people benefited from where they originated has been known for generations, however it has been associated with racist theories of genetic superiority of the people themselves.      Diamond points out that there were many advantages due to historical circumstances not based on racist theory.  Europeans conquered the new world, but the fact that they brought horses, guns, germs and steel made a significant difference in success of their invasion; not their marginal genetic difference from the conquered. None of these technological advantages originated in Europe, but farther east in Eurasia.    Eurasia is the largest landmass on Earth and it also has the widest expanse of temperate lands as well.  Thus species and technologies suited to these latitudes could spread quickly. Domestication of plants and animals and the interspecies transfer of their deseases to humans in the eurasian land mass led to better food, better bugs, and better immunity. In the America's and Africa the landmasses are oriented across latitudes, preventing the spread of plant and animal species of use to humans. The fact that the US Manifest Destiny spread east to west is compelling evidence that latitude does matter. This natural cultural evolution provided by Eurasia's latitude advantage provided unsurmountable advantages for Eurasian peoples.    Like many simple but powerful theories these are threatening ideas. The fact that preconceived notions of superiority can be explained away by simple concepts of material chance is not pleasant to some.  In his follow up book Colapse he points to the failure of the Greenland Norse who refused to adopt superior techniques of the Inuit, even as they starved to death.     By challenging the orthodoxy of racism Diamond does a service for Humanity and the natural sciences, even if some refuse to open their minds.
B000002HMH|1.0|hero of the day iz cool but beyond that the sound has changed too much.  Great rock but not great Metallica.  Then Lars started farting around chasing that Napster dude like he caused the end of the world or something, really they were done with the black album because everything after that was more rock oriented and alternative style.  Long live Metallica 1983-1992 and selloutica should find a good new fanbase since most the youth of today are zombies and do not even realize what came before anyways.
0156012197|5.0|This remarkable, little book is an excellent springboard for discussion (parent-child, teacher-student, adult-adult) about both metaphors (which is how I will use it in my 8th-grade classroom) and philosophy (where it is that I hope my students discover the focus of life, and perhaps the pitfalls of becoming, GASP!, a \\"grown-up\\").    I fear that too many readers (especially those without their own children) assume by the cover and its placement in the \\"Children's Section\\" of bookstores and libraries, that this is a \\"kids'\\" book. In reality, this is an intensely mature book that is clearly written for adults as a mid-life check (or for any age, actually) on philosophical attitudes of Love, Possession, Priorities, Relationships, Modernization, and Nature.     Though VERY short, the approach in THE LITTLE PRINCE to \\"what is really important in life\\" should not be taken lightly, frivolously, or quickly. Its commentary on \\"Self\\" is to be carefully considered, weighed in the mind, fermented for days following. There is also an undeniable universality to the messages within. Written in French in 1943, this little read will no doubt remain a timeless classic forever.
B000JVT09C|5.0|Superman Returns was one of my favorite movies of 2006. Bryan Singer nailed it! Not only was Superman Returns a great homage to the Christopher Reeve's movies but it also surpasses them in many ways.   The sound and picture are A+ on the Blu-ray DVD. I originally saw Superman Returns in an IMAX theater (in 3-D). I purchased the standard DVD when it became available and found it a letdown. With Blu-Ray, the picture and sound is as vibrant and exciting as I remember it in the theater.   This is the best-looking Blu-Ray DVD I have seen so far. If you love the original Superman movie this will not disappoint.
