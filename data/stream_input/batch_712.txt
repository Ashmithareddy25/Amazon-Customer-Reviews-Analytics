1400079276|5.0|As a fan of the Wind-up Bird Chronicle, Murakami's Kafka on the Shore provides a surrealistic trip, and an even bigger treat to fans of his previous books. With memorable characters, original story, and Murakami's unorthodox prose and style, Kafka on the Shore is an unforgettable book. Throwing musical, social, and cultural references around, Kafka has an immediate feeling, and makes it seem all the more relevant. Comparing the book to Murakami's masterpiece Wind-up Bird Chronicle is bound to happen, and as a fan I'd have to say I enjoyed both equally.

1582701709|4.0|\\"The Secret\\" inspires positive thinking and high self-esteem. It's helped me to be more aware of what I'm thinking and has helped me to slow my mind down to savor the things that are wonderful in my life. It teaches that attitude is everything and that attitude contributes to the law of attraction. I think it also inspires people to really think about what their true passions are in life. I can see why some people would be skeptical of 'making things happen' through your thoughts, but I think that if nothing else, it helps train your brain to think more positively.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|If you can't set the world on fire, then at least set stages in Europe, Russia, and Japan ablaze.  Rammstein puts on a show like no other band.  And while North America may not get treated to their spectacle live, then we can enjoy the concerts captured here.  The DVD in this set captures one full concert from France as well as moments from concers in England, Japan, and Russia.  An Accompanying CD has 16 cuts from the Nimes concert (but if you get the 4 disc set, the two cds comprise the entire Nimes concert).  The other DVD includes two documentaries.    While the bells and whistles are nice for the price, the main concert DVD is the highlight.  Rammstein is a first class group when it comes to performance - mainly for their pyrotechnics.  But it's not just setting things on fire or having flames rise from the stage.  One of the highlights is Mein Teil, where Til takes a flamethrower to a pot containing keyboardist Flake and then chases him around on stage with a Microphone shaped like a knife.  Elsewhere, Flake is seen riding a segway during Amerika while playing his keyboard, with confetti filled finale.  And there's no shortage of fire in the concert.    But what makes the concert so special is that Rammstein are a classy metal act that actually performs decent songs, and as engaging as this live show is, they still perform the songs well and performance isn't compromised by the spectacle on stage.  The energy and enthusiasm of the audience is also captured well here during songs like Du Hast and Ich Will.      I have to say that I'm not the biggest metal fan, but Rammstein has caught my eye because of their aesthetic appeal.  But if this concert proves anything, it's that they boast an incredible discography successfully combining dance and metal, have great lyrics, and also have a very dark sense of humor.  All those elements show on this set and this concert is probably one of the best representations of the band.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is not great because the story was told so well, it's great because east clashes with west and the west wins. Post 9/11 the message is beautiful. 300 European men stood off your vast army, won a mighty victory in the subsequent war and ended Bablylon in favor of the rise of the western democracies. It took awhile but Spartan steel met Bablylonian(Iraqi) corruption and Spartan steel won then and it will win now......
0307346609|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I could hardly put it down.  For a fan of The Zombie Survival Guide it does not disappoint. It adds a 'real world' side to the Guide.   It's a collection of short interviews of survivors, exploring every aspect of the zombie apocalypse.  A wonderful read.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|First of all, I think the critics were overly harsh about this second album. I bought the first one and I bought this album because the songs are good. \\"1973\\" was my favorite track for its strong lyrics and emotional melody. I've listened to this album five times over and it gets better with each play. The instrumental accompaniments are excellent. The only thing I see that might turn people off of this album compared to the first is the tender, sorrowful, sad undertones, but it's not like James Blunt is crying through each track and it's not like the tracks are unbearable. Of all the albums of this year, All the Lost Souls and Mika's Life... are probably the two most original albums.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I love this CD.  It came w/ a few scratches but plays fine overall.
0143038419|5.0|I am so glad a dear friend of mine leant me her copy of Eat, Pray, Love!  This book struck a chord with me at so many levels.  Like the author, Elizabeth Gilbert, I am going through my own quest for spiritual growth, wanting to let go of the old, usher in the new, and make peace with my life.  What a relief to know that meditation doesn't come easy, that stilling the noises in my head is a struggle for others too, that it takes discipline and self-awareness and loving yourself patiently to grow...and above all...it is so worth all of this turmoil in order to be authentic and true to yourself!  I am so inspired by her relentlessness and honesty - at all points in her year long journey, she is true to herself and keeps doggedly pursuing her cause.<br /><br />The book is so warm and well-written - I devoured it.  The author's journey may seem self-indulgent to some, but that's so relative.  I have advantages that others in this world don't and the author has some that I don't have.  Her struggles are very real to her, though.<br /><br />Thank you, Liz Gilbert, for being so brave and wearing your struggles and triumphs on your sleeve!  I know that it is no accident that this book came my way at this point in my life.  I am getting my own copy now.
159562015X|4.0|I like this version much better.  The book is a nice size to just keep in my briefcase.  It offers suggestions for building up your strengths, and it succinctly describes each strength. I used it with a client group and appreciated the extra online resources as well.<br /><br />My 2 concerns with Strengthsfinder the results are 1) it solely relies [as most assessments do] on the person's assessment - what if that person is not very self-aware? and 2) there is no quantitative reporting of scores - this is a BIG problem for me as I am wondering, \\"how much stronger is my #1 strength over my #2 strength; is my #5 strength only slightly higher than my #6, etc.\\"<br /><br />Otherwise, I found it to be quite accurate with my personal assessment and those of my clients.  Assessments such as these are tools - a great place to start with a conversation about who you are and who you are not.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|When I watch Kanye perform its like he's performing a different song in his head than the one I'm hearing and watching.  He's jumping around like he's elevating our minds with lyrics similar to \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" but I'm watching a hyper-active kid running back and forth across the stage chanting \\"Ole McDonald\\" to a decent musical arrangement, with back-up singers who are clearly related to someone in his entourage, and all arranged like it was a first time impromptu performance.  \\"Ee Aye Ya'll.  Ee Aye!  Ain't nobody puttin lyrics down like this!  Ya'll don't even recognize the significance of what ya'll are hearin' right now!\\"    \\"You can live through anything if Magic made it!\\"      This is one of the many examples of why it is a mistake to listen to hip hop for anything more than ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY!    To be fair he deserves respect for his determination in pursuing his goal of being a successful rapper/producer because he did achieve it.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This album written directly for the Sean Penn directed film \\"Into The Wild\\" (based on the best selling book by Jon Krakaur) is an excellent representation of the film soundtrack. It is not a mis-mosh of gathered songs that just happen to evoke, or hopefully evoke, the emotion and sentiment on screen. These are carefully crafted songs - deliberate in their sparce space, their tone and stripped down production.<br /><br />Take a listen to the excellent \\"Society\\" - my favorite track on the album. It has a discord and yearning that is unlike most other songs I've heard. It rings, in sentiment and proper placement, much like the Bruce Springsteen penned \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\". No, it is NOT like \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\" but it fits much like that song does - the song fits the film, fits the emotion, fits the conditions. That is not an easy thing to do.<br /><br />Finding the correct songs to fill a soundtrack, is not an easy thing and kudos should be sent to those involved with asking/requesting/pleading with Eddie Vedder to make a departure from Pearl Jam and try his hand. His take on the emotions - his vision of Sean Penn's vision - is very true to the film (and to the book, actually).<br /><br />I can whole heartedly recommend this cd. It is NOT a Pearl Jam rocker - but it is a deeply moving accompanyment to a wonderful story. Much as the story goes, so goes the music - whimsical at times, stripped to the bare, reaching, searching, etc. It's a very well done soundtrack.<br /><br />I can honestly say that several of the songs on this collection might be Academy Award worthy. Let's hope others feel the same way.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
0743486285|3.0|Casual fans of Motley Crue probably know Nikki only as the mediocre bass player of the durable 80's glam-punk metal band that's more famous for their hijinks outside the studio than in it. But this would be a mistake, because as any fan who reads their liner notes carefully knows, Nikki is actually the band's chief songwriter and visionary. In \\"The Heroin Diaries\\", we learn the extent to which the entire Motley organization hangs on his shoulders, something which prevents the band members and support personnel around him from holding him accountable for his controlling and self-destructive behavior. And the source of this behavior? Nikki attributes it all to his fragmented childhood, (which, while problematic, let's admit it - you've read worse) exaggerated by a supreme amount of chemical foolishness.<br /><br />How interesting you find this has a lot to do with whether or not you've already read Motley's \\"The Dirt\\", Richard Cole's \\"Zeppelin Uncensored\\",  or, best of all, Dave Navarro's \\"Don't Try This At Home\\". In fact, by the time you get through your third or so heroin-addled rock biopic, you start nodding off over how similar they are. Read one, read them all - and note that they tell almost the same story of addiction, violence and professional immaturity that rapidly becomes very wearying. You can almost reduce these to a few paragraphs apiece based on what they -don't- have in common, and besides - since the author is still alive, you already know how things are going turn out.<br /><br />The best parts of \\"Diaries\\" are the little bits of behind-the-scenes business information where Nikki occasionally stops to lift the curtain of how the concert and recording industry really works; unfortunately, there's not enough of this information to make the book worth buying just for this.<br /><br />Although Nikki has appeared on TV promoting the book as \\"a cautionary tale\\", one can only wonder at the book's presentation - obscured on nearly every single page with garish, sloppy Ralph Steadman-style art and aggro red-font on black color schemes designed to make Nikki's wasted year look as oh-so-rock cool as possible. One of the few high (and unintentionally comedic) points I took from this book was how professional Whitesnake (and heck, by comparison even Guns & Roses!) was and how Nikki couldn't stand the former because... they Practiced,  Showed Up On Time, Put On A Good Show, and/or Were Professional! As a glam rat, Nikki had no time for such things and almost certainly felt that leaving an elegantly wasted corpse would be good enough to reign over his peers.n-style art and aggro red-font on black color schemes designed to make Nikki's wasted year look as oh-so-rock cool as possible.

B000TUXL2A|2.0|I've got all the Mark Knopfler's and Dire Straits' CDs and DVDs. But this one is boring.  More than the Ragpicker's dream.  True love will never fade is the song I liked the most.  But from this one on, the cd is too slow and quiet. Anyway, you could listen to the cd while you're doing anything else.
B000002IOY|5.0|to describe the impact I felt when I first listened to this album. I had only heard of Overkill, but never heard them. So I decided to buy this one on a whim and it was probably one of the best decisions of my life. To start with, the band is easily one of the most talented I've ever heard. Blitz has a pretty good range and an unique singing voice, Gustafson earns every praise hes granted with his fast riffs and interesting solos, Verni has got to be one of the fastest, talented, and audible of all thrash bassists, and Falck fills out the roster nicely with some rock steady and well done drum work. And the best part they all function as an amazing song writing team. But on to the songs.    This album is easily one of the finest thrash album ever recorded. Every song is an enthralling listen and you won't feel yourself moving to skip any particular songs. Songs like 'Elimination' and 'I Hate' come at you with speedy, orginal riffs and lyrics ranging the gambit from frustrated to humorous. The 10 minute epic 'Playing with Spider/ Skullkrusher' follows in the vein of Black Sabbath with a sludgy verse and chrous with the sped up portion right in there to break up any monotony that might have some how accumulated. Even the inclusion of the two ballad-esque pieces 'Who Tends the Fire' and 'The Years of Decay' don't slow this album down as these tunes destroy any compilation album power ballad and show them how to make a truly somber mood. Finally, 'E.Vil N.Ever D.Ies' finishes the album nicely with a fast riff and a memorable chant of \\"Evil Never Dies\\" right at the end accompanied by an enormous scream by Blitz. Its hard to believe that this album was put out in 1989 because it still soundes great even today. If you even have the slightest interest in metal or even a taste for good music, I urge you nay command you to buy this and enjoy one of the finest pieces of music ever recorded by human kind. Words fail to describe it.
0385720920|1.0|I heard so many good things about this book, so many people raved about it, how it \\"changed their outlook on life\\", I felt compelled to read it.  I want my time back.  This book is garbage.  I'm not saying this because it offended me, because it did not in the least (one of my favorite books is \\"Filth\\" by Irvine Welsh for comparison).  What did offend me was that this book was utter nonsense.  If reading about the exploits of a sex-addict makes you want to change the world, go read Gene Simmons biography for christ sake.<br /><br />The message of this book (which I will not give away here even though I should to save you the time and effort) has been done so many times before, it seems as though Palahniuk just used it as a means to convey his idea of obscenity on the reader.  Glorified depravity is fine if it has a legitimate point.  Here it does not.  It's obscene for the sake of being obscene.  It has nothing to do with the story, other than to make the main character seem worse than he is...can he be redeemed in the end???<br /><br />Don't bother finding out.
1594489505|5.0|having read housseini's first book, kite runner, and absolutely loving it, i was anxious to pick this book up.  i personally think i'm a bigger fan of kite runner, but that is not to disparage splendid suns AT ALL.  this novel gives a tutelage of the treatment of women in the middle east. it also, and this is what i like about this author, continues to educate you on the history of the area before, during and \\"after\\" the numerous uprising (\\"after\\" in quote b/c have they ever truly been in an \\"after\\"?). the story is wonderful and warming, despite the brutality inbetween.  i'm still trying to figure out if i liked the ending 100%.  in the same way i wasn't a fan of the slingshot scene in kite runner, i wasn't happy with the father leaving the letter/money in the end.  i don't know why, but whereas the rest of both novels almost reads like a memoir or biography, those two particular scenes really are too fiction-like...just my humble opinion.  great book.  i'll pass it on (already have, actually)!<br />-sp-
B000E2AZ2C|4.0|1982's \\"Blade Runner\\" was a highly original and dramatic sci-fi thriller starring Harrison Ford as Decker, a burnt-out bounty hunter living in a high tech 21st Century Los Angeles.  Decker is a so-called blade runner; his job is to hunt down rogue replicants, human-like androids genetically engineered to resemble humans and who sometimes go out of control.  The replicants have exceptional strengths and abilities, but come with a pre-programmed lifespan.  Only an experienced blade runner like Decker can spot one in a crowd.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Decker is lured out of retirement to track down four renegade replicants, led by Rutger Haur as their ruthless but oddly philosophical leader.  The four rogues attempt to hide in the dark, rainy forest of high-rises that is Los Angeles, a multi-cultural Tokyo on steroids.<br /><br />Decker will hunt down the rogues one by one.  Each confrontation serves to build sympathy for the replicants, who seem only too human in their desire to live, and for Decker, who has come to loath his job.  Decker will get assistance from Rachel (Sean Young), herself a replicant.  Decker's confrontation with his final opponent is a haunting indication of what a replicant might or might not be capable of.<br /><br />This edition of \\"Blade Runner\\" has the ending presented in the original theatrical release, including Decker's explanatory voice-over.  Other editions of this movie, which has spawned its own cult following, have other endings, director cuts, and revisions.  Highly recommended as a ground-breaking example of the sci-fi genre.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This isn't a great film and certainly doesn't live up to the hype that surrounded it (although that was mostly self-publicity). Yes there are some horrible moments but after a while you become immune to the blood and guts and really don't care about the characters. Hitchcock showed us more than fifty years ago that if you want to be frightened don't show the viewer whats behind the door. This gets a few marks purely on a gore level but for most of the time its a remarkably souless venture.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that there are rich people in eastern europe who pay for the pleasure of torturing people. The victims are lured by sex and thats it really. You get the inevitable soft-core for the lads and not much else. If you see it once you probably wont ever want to see it again. So I would rent it rather than purchase.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I was so excited when this came out on DVD. This is a great comedy, definitely the best one on T.V. right know. I can't wait for the release of Season 2.
0316010669|4.0|The premise of this book is how we make split second decisions subconciously without really knowing it.  This is explored in both a positive and negative light.  Sometimes our intuitions are dead on, other times they lead to disaster.<br /><br />That being said, this topic is fascinating and the examples used are, for the most part, an intriguing look into the synapses of the mind.  The book is highly entertaining and presents a bewildering dilemma.  How do we know when these intuitive thoughts are a good thing as opposed to something detrimental to our being?<br /><br />The problem with this book is that there is no real connection between the two.  Beyond the examples of when split second decisions work, and when they don't there is no real explanation as to why they go one way or another.  Understandably, this is a difficult question to answer, and is probably not answerable altogether.  Still, there is no real wrap up to the book, it rather presents itself as a series of examples.<br /><br />Even so, this is a fascinating book about the inner workings of the mind, and it makes you want to dig deeper into the mysteries within it.
B0000028RR|5.0|I be lovin' me some Rage and it be showin' like a mother...! :-) I have several Rage CDs and this is the oldest (and still the best). This is one of my favorite rock/alternative rock albums. Sounded like rap to me at first, which I don't typically like, but people who enjoy rap, tell me this is NOT rap. Okay, so this is great alternative rock. I am sure it will be classic rock of the future!
0143036556|3.0|\\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" examined the environmental reasons for the collapses of various societies including the Mayan civilization in Mexico, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Polynesian societies on Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Island, among other various societies. Not limited to examining failure, Diamond also provided explanations of the ways that societies recognized and avoided environmental collapse.  Examples of these successes include Japan at the time of Tokugawa and the New Guinea highlands.    Diamond arranged his examination of collapsing societies around the five stress points that cause societies to fail: Environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of friendly trade partners, and a society's responses to its environmental problems. Any one, though usually two or more can cause a society to collapse. Obviously, the more problems a society has the more difficult it is to avoid collapse. (The presence of hostile neighbors, climate change, environmental damage and a poor response to environmental problems is usually a more dire situation than just the loss of a trading partner - though not always.)    For all the time spent citing examples from history, \\"Collapse\\" isn't just a collections of facts about the past. Diamond also provides up-to-date evidence of the problems we face now. He exposes our own society as no more permanent than that of the Maya.    Diamond finds evidence of the coming collapse of our society in Montana, which he examines extensively. Lack of water to grow food is one of the great causes of societal collapse and Diamond shows the problems the western U.S. is having supporting its population. He also points to the many other small 'first signs' of coming problems such as the rich insulating themselves in gated communities.    For all the dire examples, Diamond doesn't damn western society. He doesn't declare that we've already driven off the cliff of un-sustainability but he doesshow us that we're quickly racing towards it. His examinations of what worked in the past, what didn't work in the past, and what is going on right now, show that the most important 'point' out of the five is the response a society has to the new environmental pressures. If we can formulate the right response, there's no reason why our society shouldn't be among the list of civilizations that side-stepped collapse.
B000002C25|5.0|This album solidified my love of Oasis from an early inkling of appreciation fostered by the rock radio standard \\"Champagne Supernova\\" from two years prior. Upon my ears' receiving it, I was floored by this album's massive sound. The opening track \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" lifts the minor chord progression from the pseudo-love song and eminent Oasis hit \\"Wonderwall\\" and turns it into a grandiose epic; almost too big of a song to NOT be played in a football stadium at full blast. From there, the tracks remain relentless.<br /><br />The album seems to scoff at you: \\"if rock music isn't big, its not worthwhile\\". Oddly enough,  all of these songs are despised by their author Noel Gallagher, (with the possible exception of \\"Stand By Me\\" which the band continues to play live) who seemed to take the music community's criticism of the album's perceived  pretentiousness to heart and blamed the million-multi-layered guitars and non-radio friendly song lengths on the coke binge that apparently permeated the recording sessions. It is a shame that Noel and Co. decided to become self-conscious, (with the exception of Liam, who is still convinced that he's John Lennon incarnate) and looking at what followed, the general disappointments begin to add up. (Heathen Chemistry, most notably). At least coattail riders JET seemed to have picked up the arrogance slack with their attempt at Oasisism; \\"Shine On\\".<br /><br />Universally seen as the beginning of the end of Oasis' popularity in the states, \\"Be Here Now\\" remains my favorite, perhaps stubbornly so. It is the album of a band who thinks it is the greatest and is out to prove it, but if they ultimately can't convince you of that fact, then the Gallagher bros. kindly ask you to bugger off. Cockiness, while eventually leading to delusions of grandeur in Oasis' case, still can produce a sound that displays no reservations; showcasing only the unabashed verve, (apologies to Richard Ashcroft) of a band holding nothing back.
B000VNMMQ6|1.0|had \\"die hard 4\\" blu ray been the unrated edition, the complete die hard collection on blu ray would have been a guaranteed purchase.  such as it is, i am buying NONE until no.4 comes out unrated on blu ray (stupid marketing decision imo).
B000001GF9|3.0|Then you'll love this disc.  It has the typical unexpected dramatic and sometimes outright bizarre (as in not written by the composer in the score) touches Bernstein is noted for.  The orchestral playing is very good, but I find the choral performance average; the consistency of the singing by the choir is my complaint here.  The highly respected soloists do an admirable job.  But overall, I find the performance bloated, especially in the Cum Santu Spiritu:  After the wonderful and reverant opening the pace is much slower than Mozart's score indicates.  It's as if Lenny was trying to milk the reverence factor by 10.  This disc is not a bad performance, but in my humble opinion I don't feel that Bernstein shines in choral works like this.  Bernstein performs best in works, like Pictures at an Exhibition, where his unique and grandiose views work well, especially in phrasing.  His symphonic Mozart is great though.  This disc is what I would think Stowkowski's version would sound like if he did the Mozart Mass in C min.
B0000027RL|5.0|This has the biggest and most popular Pearl Jam hits that I can remember, but I'd recommend rearview mirror over this one because that one has even more.
B00006L3S3|4.0|John Lennon must have been feeling some pressure after coming of his masterpiece \\"[[ASIN:B0000457L2 Imagine]].\\" This follow-up seems to strain at times to match the effortlessness of that album, and the comparative tracks come up short. The title track seems that John wanted to reach the ethereal peaks of his previous titular track, but it veers off into a thoroughly different direction. It's still a brilliant song, and it is the best thing about the remastered CD.<br /><br />On the other hand, when John wrote the scathing \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" about his ex-Beatle pal, did his own ears start to burn as he recorded the trifling \\"One Day At a Time\\" for himself? And as socially astute as he often was, both the activist tunes \\"Bring On The Lucie\\" and \\"Only People\\" have not aged well. But you know what? Second tier John Lennon beats most wannabes 8 days a week.<br /><br />So you skip the tracks that have lost their luster and home in on those that could have been cut last week. \\"Tight As\\" is the kind of Carl Perkins beaut that Lennon could knock out with ease. The original album closer (and \\"Mind Games\\" B-Side) \\"Meat City\\" could have come out of Seattle 1991. The shuffling \\"Intuition\\" has a charm to it that has stayed on the 34 years since the album originally came out. Finally, the title track is still one of the best things John Lennon ever did as a solo artist. While \\"Imagine\\" will always be that pinnacle of creativity and self-competitiveness, \\"Mind Games\\" is still a very good album in its own rite.<br /><br />The \\"bonus tracks\\" are, as usual, forgettable. Lennon playing into a cassette deck on songs that matured later is interesting once. Otherwise, unnecessary.

B000RZIGUY|4.0|It took two Hollywood films ([[ASIN:0783227892 Hard Target]] and [[ASIN:6305280754 Broken Arrow]]) before John Woo was allowed to cut loose with his trademark style on Face/Off. The result was his most commercially and critically successful American film at that point in his career. However, for fans of his Hong Kong films, this one seemed like a highlight reel from his earlier work as Woo recycled many of his signature shots Birds flying in slow motion? Check. Guy Leaping in the air while firing two guns simultaneously? Check. Unfortunately, Face/Off marks the apex of his Hollywood career. Woo has done nothing since that's been as good. So, to celebrate the film's 10th anniversary, Paramount has revisited the film with a brand new special edition.<br /><br />Woo works hard to sell the film's admittedly outlandish gimmick by throwing all kinds of scientific mumbo jumbo at us and lingering on shots of spiffy looking technology. The swapping of identities also allows the filmmaker to examine one of his favourite themes: how two people can exhibit similar characteristics but be on opposite sides of the law and on opposite sides of the moral spectrum. It is nice to see Woo finally given a decent-sized budget to play with and two big-time movie stars like Cage and Travolta to work with. Despite a few audacious glimmers, like staging a chaotic gunfight around a child listening to \\"Under the Rainbow,\\" we still get a recycling of Woo's stylistic trademarks. However, this can be somewhat forgiven as it was the first real exposure for many North Americans to his work on a mainstream level.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by director John Woo and screenwriters Mike Werb and Michael Colleary.

0066620996|5.0|The heart of my consulting revolves around moving individuals and companies from mediocrity to excellence so I knew I was right at home when Collins started out his book with a chapter called \\"Good is the Enemy of Great\\".  It ends up that this book not only enhanced how I look at businesses, but also enriched our family.<br /><br />This book has become part of our family culture, including having been read by our business-minded 12-year-old.  We see him look around our world and make observations about \\"getting the right people on the bus\\" (highlighting the importance of getting the right people as part of the team before determining where you're going) or the \\"hedgehog concept\\" (the place of simplicity and overlap between your passion, what you can be the best in the world at, and make money doing).  It has given us a common language upon which to discuss our observations about what companies are doing that likely will contribute to their success or failure.<br /><br />Even if you are not in the business world, many of the applications apply to other groups like sports teams or even families.  As parents, we try to exercise Level 5 Leadership, focusing on the larger goal of building a great family over feeding our own ego needs.  We teach that a Culture of Discipline relieves us from being rule enforcers and best supports every individual in our family to become their best.  These concepts have enriched our family (and are an easier sell when it comes from Collins and is based on extensive research than if our kids think we just made this stuff up!)<br /><br />This book is a must read for any company, organization or team leader who is committed to taking their team to a level of excellence.  If this book is not in your library, you need to add a copy soon.<br /><br />Mollie Marti, Ph.D., J.D.<br />Author, Selling: Powerful New Strategies for Sales Success
B000SNUMC0|3.0|Obviously my title doesn't refer to the band's future, but to ours (haha)...  There's no need for me to go over the story; it's in the editorial review, though I do mention a few plot SPOILERS so skip this review if you don't want the details.  Otherwise, bear with me, this is a long review because I've addressed every song...    \\"Overture\\" - a subdued instrumental featuring a sorrowful, somewhat classical cello melody and the skeleton (via clean electric guitar) of the trilogy's closing riff.  \\"Something Wicked I\\" - although any real IE fan knows the trilogy's melodies by heart and they were revisited on this year's earlier release, it makes sense for Schaffer to go through them once more to open his first full-length concept album (The Dark Saga story was a comic book first, I consider Horror Show and The Glorious Burden thematic rather than conceptual, and Gettysburg's long, but it's a trilogy, not a complete album). Immediately after the first verse, I hear trademark IE and, moving into the sub-choruses and chorus, Owens has great power when he hits the highest notes. That's the one thing about him that always gets my attention.  \\"Invasion\\" - gunfire and explosions interrupt the sounds of daily life.  \\"Motivation of Man\\" - a pounding war track, with razor-blade style guitar riffs and an eerie vocal/guitar harmony thrown in to enhance the dark mood.  \\"Setian Massacre\\" - whereas the previous song portrays the destructive greed of human nature, this one is a continuation (musically) that presents the other side of the story. Since the Setians are so peaceful, I guess they have no means of fighting back and can only flee from battle.  \\"A Charge to Keep\\" - the classic power metal song so far, and easily my favorite on the album. It's fairly simple and straightforward in terms of song structure, but also very emotional: here the band slows things down a bit, and I wouldn't quite call it a ballad but the mood fits Tim's voice extremely well, with cool vocal group harmonies in the chorus.  \\"Reflections\\" - the band takes its foot completely off the gas pedal and this is the shortest song besides the instrumentals. Of course you don't need distortion and power chords all the time...  \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" - but I sure as hell like them. In an instant, they're back into high gear with the explosive start; I've covered this song in my review of OOTW.  \\"Execution\\" - the drawing shows 12 Setians on their knees, moments from death, and in the drawing below, another one (presumably the leader/High Priest), is also kneeling, facing up at the barrel of a gun. I'm not sure how the story can continue if the 13 most important Setians are dead. Perhaps the rest of the 10,000 know what has to be done and have the means to achieve that end?  \\"Order of the Rose\\" - takes a while to get to the point, but it says the tale of Christ is a ploy of the Setian race. Since I'm an atheist (and ex-Christian), this is cool fantasy/storybook stuff. The logical and eternal conclusion of spiritual faith is division - humans spend their energy trying to persuade others that they've swallowed lies (of another religion, or even the same religion: see Catholics, Baptists, Episcopals, Assembly of God, Lutheran, etc.) - and these quarrels, in every nation and every era, keep our race from uniting.  \\"Cataclysm\\" - winds howl over a wasteland, with charges of lightning, rumbling thunder, and echoes of one of the SW melodies.  \\"The Clouding\\" - here's the album's epic, just over 9 minutes long. It tackles mankind's existential crisis, brought on by a lack of memory (somehow accomplished by the Setians) - that is, we can't remember our origins as a race and therefore look at life with a \\"sense of wonder\\" as well as a \\"sense of sadness.\\" About 5 minutes in, the music gets heavy to reiterate the Setians' knowledge of the human capacity for deception - the guitar riff in the verses and all the elements of the chorus are very catchy.  \\"Infiltrate and Assimilate\\" - I don't hearanything special here because it doesn't resemble IE. The chorus has a bright, positive feel as it expresses the Setian's hope that they'll live among humans and deceive them, pursuing the \\"divide and conquer\\" strategy.  \\"Retribution Through the Ages\\" - I think this one's a bit vanilla too: it's pretty fast, but it doesn't pack any real punch for me.  \\"Something Wicked II\\" - a fusion of tribal drumming and jangling acoustic guitar chords that seems a little too long. Nevertheless, it has its place in the story because the SW I track that begins the album is the harbinger of mankind's invasion, and SW II seems to foretell the birth of Set Abominae. In sum, each side has a wicked creation...  \\"The Domino Decree\\" - finally the band puts Setian anger into sonic form. This one gets to the meat: revenge, served up cold by killing great human leaders throughout history. It's referenced in the trilogy: \\"Jesus Christ to Kennedy, The Domino Decree...\\"  \\"Framing Armageddon\\" - another fast, hard-driving track, but it doesn't blow me away.  \\"When Stars Collide (Born Is He)\\" - like \\"A Charge To Keep,\\" this one is fairly slow, but with chunky guitar riffs, and these aspects make it another of the most memorable tracks. Describing the imminent scourge of mankind, here we have an outstanding chorus: \\"born is he, 10 millennia... sworn are we, 10 millennia...\\" It captures the ageless quest for revenge - one that has never faltered and that will soon make ancient dreams and prophecies reality.  \\"The Awakening\\" - the last of 6 instrumentals; it's a mixture of classical and mid-Eastern vocals.    In sum, a lot of this album doesn't sound like IE, and while there's a lot of cool stuff going on, there are several songs I can't get into. I think it's on the same level as most of their albums, but doesn't compete with The Dark Saga, Burnt Offerings and Something Wicked This Way Comes. Anyway, this CD should be reevaluated once the sequel comes out: then we can compare/contrast the two halves. I imagine Schaffer will unleash Set Abominae in great, graphic detail as an indestructible and horrible force - one whose very name makes the skin crawl because he mercilessly slays entire armies and nations with inconceivable powers, winning countless battles of unparalleled brutality. After all, he's a 10,000-year old prophecy of retribution come true, \\"born in sacred flames\\" to be \\"the end of man\\" - I look forward to hearing the conclusion...

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is simply a superb piece of film-making: a memorable plot, believable dialogue, touching, tense, and first-class acting, particularly from Ulrich Muhe, who (sad to say) passed away recently. His performance deserves to be ranked among the very best ever.
B0000549B0|1.0|I ordered and promptly rec'd two copies of this movie.  The DVD is a remake of an old Jimmy Stewart film.  Unfortunately, it doesn't play at all.  I kept one and gave one as a gift. Their's doesn't work either. You can see some color but no movie.  Every other DVD I own works on this player fine.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but having just finished watching the last episode of season one, I am so blown away by this series I just had to share. First of all, I love the premise of this character and am sorry I didn't think of it myself . . . A serial killer who only kills bad people. How cool is that? When I first heard that Michael C. Hall was cast in the lead role, I was skeptical, even though I absolutely loved his performance in Six Feet Under. Having watched the show, though, I can't think of anyone more perfect for the role than he is. He totally nails this character. His ability to smile and mimic emotional expressions while at the same time communicating that there is nothing behind them . . . amazing. The supporting cast is all top-flight, as well. This is a richly conceived drama, with comic elements that are understated, but clearly felt, populated by convincing, three-dimensional characters. You will not watch a better television series this year, so pull out your credit card right now and order Dexter - The First Season, and I'm sure you will have the same problem my wife and I have -- we can't watch just one episode in a sitting. You're gonna love this!

B000R7HY0K|5.0|I loved Death Proof.  It works much better on its own than in its original Grindhouse format. Grindhouse was a great idea, but the directors should have stuck with the plan and made two 50 - 60 minutes films. As a double feature, both films were too long.  There was no intermission.  The trailers didn't add anything to the experience (authentic '70s trailers would have been better).  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Grindhouse.  The defects in the soundtrack and film stock, as well as the little touches such as the 'feature presentation' banner and music made me feel genuinely nostalgic for the drive-in movies I loved as a teenager in the '70s.  Death Proof suffered following Planet Terror.  Planet Terror was such a fast-paced, over-the-top thriller that Death Proof seemed slow and conventional by comparison.  Taken on its own, Death Proof is a hell of a movie.  Kurt Russell plays a sociopathic ex-stuntman who builds cars to use as weapons against the women he methodically stalks.  The movie is about his victims.  The first half follows a group of women (played by Sydney Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito and Jordan Ladd) out for drinks at the Texas Chili Parlor.  The second half follows a second group of women (Rosario Dawson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Tracie Thoms, and Zoe Bell) on location and looking to have some fun with a borrowed Dodge Challenger.  The halves are so disparate, Death Proof plays like a movie and its sequel.  The only character connecting the two halves is Stuntman Mike.  The second half is in pristine condition, which adds to the effect of a sequel playing along with the original as a double bill, the original now a much worn film.  The dialogue in the first half is classic Tarrantino, as are the music, the sets, the direction, and the acting.  The second half is a revenge film straight out of the 70s.  The action in the second half is crazy, edge of your seat stuff.  Zoë Bell is amazing.  She is obvious doing her own stunts (at least most of them), new stunts, incredible stunts, stupidly dangerous stunts.  The chase scene ending the movie is absolutely authentic.  I love both halves of Death Proof.  It works better on its own than as the second feature of Grindhouse.  I couldn't be happier that the movies are being released separately (for now).  Tarantino is a great director because he makes the kinds of movies that he loves to watch.  We need more movies like this.

0345494997|4.0|In 1972, I attended a conference at Frank Lloyd Wright's famous house, Taliesin, and I've carried a vision of it ever since: its startlingly flat planes, the Oriental lines of its roofs, the way it snugs into the side of a Wisconsin hill. And indoors, the Zen-like simplicity of furnishings, the wide windows that open onto green landscape, and the glowing walls that seem to shimmer with their own inner light. I can understand why Mamah Borthwick Cheney fell in love with its architect and loved him with an outrageous passion until she died. I may have been a little in love with him myself when I left that remarkable house.<br /><br />Loving Frank is a fictional recreation of the true story of the adulterous affair with Wright that pulled Mamah Cheney away from her young children, her husband, and their prosperous, comfortable life in Oak Park, Illinois. Wright himself was married, the father of six children, and a rising young architect. The two were drawn together in 1903 when Wright designed a house for the Cheneys.<br /><br />Mamah Borthwick was a scholar and feminist when she married Edwin Cheney, and one of the things Nancy Horan does best in this tumultuous novel is to show how the egotistical, charismatic Wright reawakens her desire to be more than simply a mother and wife-to dream dreams impossible for those whose existences are constrained by convention. Horan also brings to life Mamah's terrible dilemma: how to create and sustain a life based on passion when that means giving up her two children, whom she also deeply loves. And Horan tellingly illuminates the conflicted relationship between Mamah and Ellen Key, a Swedish feminist and writer whose liberal ideas about sex, marriage, and child-care were far ahead of her time.<br /><br />Loving Frank is all the more remarkable because it is Nancy Horan's first novel. The pace and intensity may lag a bit in the middle and drop off after the tragic events of 1914. And I might have wished for a more detailed documentation of sources. Still, these are minor reservations about what is overall a fine achievement, a rich, compellingly imaginative work that allows us to see into the private emotional lives of two intriguing people: the man who significantly influenced American architecture for over fifty years, and the woman who loved him. It's a book that will be remembered.<br /><br />Susan Wittig Albert is the author of several historical novels, including [[ASIN:0425210391 Death on the Lizard (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 12)]].

By Dream Warriors Part 3 it gets cheesy but still enjoyable. Part 4 is one of my favorite Nightmare movies but part 5 sucked. 6 is funny and 7 I really didnt care for that movie. I know alot of people hate Freddy's Dead but I did enjoy the film. I know every line that Freddy says in the movie because I love them all. The bonus dvd is really worth buying the set alone for. Its probably one of the best dvd features that has ever been made. I recommend this to horror fans. My favorite movies were Parts 1,2,4 and 6.
0385520298|5.0|For anyone that has ever felt displaced, the moment can feel absolutely overwhelming, never-ending and almost tragic.  It could be moving to a different neighborhood, the first day on the job or starting a new semester at school.  Everyone has been there.  Xiaolu Guo narrates a story of severe displacement, of a young girl from China, Z, moving to London to learn English.  Z not only has to learn a different language and culture, she has to grow into adulthood in a country foreign to her.  The author's voice is paradoxically both, heart-breaking and comical.  I read this book in one sitting and a 15-minute train ride and it had me laughing one minute, crying the next.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|As much as Tarantino loves to over indulge himself by writing way too much dialogue in his films (this being his worst), I'm surprised he never has English subtitles for his DVD's.<br />Oh, well.<br />I would give the film itself 3 stars, but I took one star away for the Weinstein's separating this film from Planet Terror and all of the great trailers (which won't even be on the Planet Terror disc!). I'm sure there's a double-dip on the horizon?

B000ULQV0W|4.0|I believe one measure of how good a soundtrack is how well it stands up on its own without the movie showing.  There's way too many soundtracks where the music sounds great in the movie, but is a complete bore when you get it alone with your stubby little earbuds (especially the instrumental passages).  Thank goodness this isn't one of them.  Eddie Vedder was the right choice for this movie; his distinctive voice adds to the atmosphere of the subject matter, along with the music.  The highlights for me include Setting Forth, No Ceiling (too short though!), Hard Sun and Society.  Like other reviewers have already stated, a few of the songs are a bit short and could probably stand another couple of verses.  Still, 26 minutes of good music is far better than 70 minutes of dreck, which is getting way too common these days.  Most fans of Pearl Jam should be able to get into this album, it sounds a bit like a PJ unplugged EP.

B000784WMW|5.0|There are many adaptations of Charlotte Brontë's classic novel \\"Jane Eyre\\", and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best. The short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min. length, consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel. The TV series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine's life.<br /><br />There are three TV mini series, released in '73, '83 and 2006. The 2006 version is not only the worst of these three, but the worst of all Jane Eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film. The novel's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones, and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel. What it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the Rochester and Jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book, but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set. It is a silly soap opera, in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake. This \\"Jane Eyre\\" (as it dares to call itself) is indeed a slap in the face of Charlotte Brontë.<br /><br />The 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between Mr. Rochester and Jane are rendered in nearly their full length. But what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen. At times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen, and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by Jane's voice-overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess. And despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured. Another problem is the casting of the main characters. Sorcha Cusack's portrayal of Jane as a bold, self-confident, worldly-wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model, and Michael Jayston, although a good actor, does simply not possess the commanding physical presence or the charisma necessary to play Rochester. Although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience.<br /><br />All the faults of the '73 version stand corrected in the TV mini series of '83 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Although from a purist's point of view Timothy Dalton is too handsome, tall and lean to be Rochester, he possesses the essential qualities for the role: He has an imposing physical presence, great magnetism and an air of self-assurance and authority. And despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of Thornfield convincingly. But the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of Rochester's character. Of all the actors who have played Rochester he is the only one to capture them all: Rochester's harshness, nearly insolence, his moodiness and abruptness, as well as his humorous side, his tenderness, his solicitude and deep, frantic love. Dalton's handling of Charlotte Brontë's language is equally superb. Even Rochester's most far-fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when Dalton delivers them. He is the definitive Rochester, unsurpassed and unsurpassable, and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine Rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of Rochester. She portrays exactly the Jane of the novel, an outwardly shy, reserved and guarded young woman, but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will. She catches beautifully the duality in Jane's character: her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand, and her fire and passion on the other, her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong. She and Dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight.<br /><br />As regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the '73 version, but with one important difference: The dialogues are shortened in this version, but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged. Thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech, while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of Charlotte Brontë's language. And in contrast to the earlier BBC version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured.<br /><br />The plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the '73 series. It is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel, where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of Jane's life. It is the only Jane Eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel, and the only one which does full justice to the novel's pivotal and most heartrending scene when Jane and Rochester meet after the aborted wedding. Timothy Dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill. He renders with almost painful intensity Rochester's anguish as he realizes Jane's resolution to leave him, his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him. It is a heartbreaking, almost devastating, scene, which will stay with the viewer for a long time.<br /><br />With even the smaller roles perfectly cast, an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true \\"Jane Eyre\\".
B0001XAPX8|5.0|The Human Stain starring Anthony Hopkins is full of raw emotion, shame, and the power to forgive are the themes explored in this provactive film.

I don't want my ears covered. They just sit comfortably in my ears. I listen to book tapes several hours a day while cooking, cleaning house, knitting, etc. They allow me to hear when the kids come in the house, if the dog is barking, or the phone rings. Great in the summer because they don't cover your ears. Very light-weight. Perfect for a busy mom.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|This is one of the best productions of this opera I have seen so far.  I think that Spagnoli and Bayo are perfect in their roles.  They are great singers too.  They look more innocent and childish than witty though but I think that precisely that is the idea the stage director wants to convey.  Praises appart for the \\"monster\\" Juan Diego Florez who, behind his rather skinny figure conceals one of the most beautiful and portentous tenor voices of the century.  It is also great to see the legendary Ruggiero Raimondi in his cameo role of the music teacher Don Basilio.  The idea of a modular black and white stage that goes from colorless at the beginning of the opera to colorfull by the end works perfectly well.  At times you feel like watching a nicely staged childrens play.  I particularly liked the effect of the waving white blanket in Raimondi's aria  \\"La calumnia e un venticello\\" that is a simple but neat idea, bravo for Emilio Sagi!!!  Since it was staged in Madrid it was a clever idea to introduce some real \\"sevillanas\\" dancing numbers all through the whole opera that worked perfectly well without being intrusive.  However the main course is, definetely Florez final aria:  \\"Cessa di piu resistere\\" that can be described by just breathtaking!!!
B00005CCA9|5.0|with so many glowing reviews of Argerich's early (1982) live recording of the Rachmaninov Third, I can only add that I was happy to see the original coupling deleted in favor of the Suite #2 for two pianos.  Everyone owns a good Tachikovsky First Concerto already. What Freire and Argerich achieve in the suite is without equal -- tis is a pet piece of mine, and to my ears their united sense of style and virtuosity is quite exceptional. If you want more of their collaboration, it can be found on a Philips Duo that includes all the recordings Argerich made in the two-piano format, a favorite of hers wince she gave up much of her solo playing.<br /><br />The only other point I'd like to make is that Argerich's concerto performance has been a bit misrepresented here. She isn't all-out dramatic, propulsive, exciting, etc., as other reviewers claim.  The opening to the first movement is notably laid back and even recessive. Where other virtuosos come flying out of the gate, Argerich bides her time and creates thrilling climaxes a few at a time. This comes as a blessed relief; what makes the Rachmaninov Third hard to take is its relentless showmanship.  \\"Finger-killing\\" isn't a compliment, and Argerich makes the work much less nerve-racking by limiting its thunderous assaults.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I was skeptical at first; Kurt Russell playing a calculating, manipulative madman who uses an automobile to kill girls?  I mean, Russell's great and all...but REALLY?  So naturally, when I saw \\"Grindhouse\\" in theaters (yes, world, I was one of the few) I came in ready to critique. What I found was a surprise (although, in retrospect, not much of one)--Russell pretty much reinvents himself here.  Snake Pliskin and Wyatt Earp no more; here we have Stuntman Mike, who goes around stalking and killing beautiful young women.  That's basically the movie.<br /><br />The great thing about grindhouse cinema is that plot is irrelevant; we come for over-the-top performances, outrageous scenes, a bit of sex and bruality, and not much else.  Of course, this is a Tarantino film, so you DO get something else--great acting, writing, and directing, not to mention a killer (oh dear, a pun!) soundtrack.  I know a lot of people will be unhappy with this movie, as it takes about forty-five minutes for anything to really happen...but when it happens, IT HAPPENS.  And face it--up 'til that point, and ever afterward, it's totally cool.<br /><br />A word about the release...yes, I am disappointed that \\"Grindhouse\\" was not released in full.  Not surprised, though; I left the theater and told the people I was with that there was no way in hell the movie was going to be released as a single unit.  I mean, we're talking Tarantino and Rodriguez here.  What do you expect them to do--follow the rules?  \\"Grindhouse\\" was a THEATRICAL event; I would love to see it again in its entirety, but the effect would be totally lost on a home television set.  Yes, it's a minor tragedy that we don't have the fake previews; and I think it's a shame that some of the \\"lost\\" scenes were re-instated (although I'm giddy as a schoolboy that the scratches weren't edited out; thank God for small favors).  But take \\"Death Proof\\" as what it is--a great thriller, another in a long line of Tarantino cult-classics.  And if you're upset about the absence of \\"Planet Terror,\\" watch the preview for it in the bonus features.

B000008I4Z|5.0|After Marillion moved in a generally more commercial direction for their previous album \\"Holidays In Eden\\" the band did an about face and put out \\"Brave\\" which is one of the most uncommercial albums of their career.  \\"Brave\\" is a concept album that tells the story of a runaway girl who attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge.  The album tells her life story.  The album was augumemted by a film that also fleshed out the tale.  The music on this disc is for the most part dark and brooding.  It tends to be an album that Marillion fans tend to either rank as one of their best ever or as one of their most pretentious.  It is another one of those discs that had to grow on me over time.  When it first came out I thought the concept was solid, but the music was somewhat lacking.  The beginning and the end of the album were great, but it bogged down a bit in the middle.  Over the years I kept coming back to \\"Brave\\" from time to time and appreciate it more with each re-visit.  This is not at album that you listen to while driving down the road in your car.  \\"Brave\\" is an album that you listen to on a good stereo or with headphones while you can sit down and really concentrate on it.  The individual tracks don't work that well by themselves (with a few exceptions), but taken as a whole this is a brilliant piece of work.  As mentioned prior, the majority of the music on this disk moody and dark.  There are a few heavier rock sections such as \\"Hard As Love\\", but you are not going to find a lot of the more high energy Marillion on this one.  The final section of the album consisting of \\"Brave\\", \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"Last Of You\\", \\"Falling From The Moon\\", and \\"Made Again\\" is simply gorgeous contains everything that makes Marillion great.  \\"Brave\\" is not an album for casual listening.  It needs to be consumed as the whole that it is.  The album may not grab you at first, but give it time and you may find it to be a very rewarding listen.

0060557818|3.0|This book was highly recommended, but I found it somewhat difficult to get into.  The characters are very sketchily drawn, and the story just seems to wander with no real point.  There are plays on the names of several London Underground stations, but they seem randomly selected and don't really add anything to the story.  There's no explanation of the talents of the various inhabitants of London Below, or any indication of the alliances/hostilities that require areas/times of safe passage.  Some characters seem to move between the worlds and the main character suddenly \\"disappears\\" from the world above for no apparent reason other than to bring him below as the narrator.  The book is very well written as far as the imagery, but without a compelling story to hold it together, it just doesn't mean much.
0618680004|1.0|I am hugely disappointed in this book because Dawkins is a top scientist and moreover the author of one of the seminal books in my life, \\"The Selfish Gene\\". But his stroll into the field of philosophy of religion has here resulted in a book that's bellow mediocre. The fact that this book proved so popular only evidences how little critical thought there is around, including in atheist circles.     The single biggest error in the book is that it misstates the question as an opposition between theism and science, when the opposition is between the ontological views of theism and naturalism. This is such a fundamental category error that any subsequent discussion is rendered not only irrelevant but also misleading. The trouble starts at page 2 where Dawkins writes: \\"'the God Hypothesis' is a scientific hypothesis about the universe\\", which, I dare say, would be news to almost all theists.     So why does Dawkins believe that the theistic hypothesis is a matter for scientific investigation? Because he assumes that naturalism is true and in naturalism any ontological hypothesis can be investigated scientifically (Dawkins thinks). But naturalism opposes theism (naturalism and theism cannot be both true) so by assuming naturalism Dawkins begs the whole question. And, by the way, he does not explain why he thinks that naturalism is true. Apparently his justification goes something like this: the vast majority of scientists are naturalists; science has proven its truth beyond doubt; therefore naturalism is true.      A second example is his much ballyhooed \\"Ultimate Boeing 747\\" argument for the non-existence of God. It seems Dawkins is so certain that theism is not only false but also trivially false that he fancies himself able to present a killer argument against the existence of God, one that academic philosophers were not smart enough to spot. What's his argument? Well, Dawkins reasons that if God were an explanation for the existence of our complex universe then God would be an even more complex and improbable entity, which moreover would need an even bigger explanation for its existence. As Plantinga notes in his review of the book this argument is so primitive that it would receive a failing grade in a sophomore philosophy class. After all the only reason to believe that an intelligent mind is complex is to assume that it must work on the mechanical principles that a naturalistic understanding of reality posits. But to posit naturalism as an implicit premise is - again - to beg the question. Moreover Dawkins fails to see that an explanation works on its own merits; it's not like an explanation works only if you have an explanation for that explanation too - if that were so then no explanations would be possible at all.     But where Dawkin's systematic begging the question becomes painfully obvious is in his discussion of the so-called anthropic principle. This plausible principle states that reality must be such as to produce any phenomenon we now observe, and specifically must be such as to produce humans like us. Now an as yet unanswered scientific question is the origin of life (which must not be confused with the origin of the species), i.e. how come the enormously improbable phenomenon of life has started on Earth, which is a necessary condition for the natural evolution of the species to subsequently take place. Now instead of clearly stating that science does not yet know the answer and leave it at that, Dawkins notes that some theists claim that the answer is some supernatural action by God which started life on Earth. So he must find an alternative explanation and he thinks that the anthropic principle fits the bill. Here is his reasoning (page 136): \\"The great majority of planets in the universe are ... not suitable for life. ... However small the minority of planets with just the right conditions for life may be, we necessarily have to be on one of that minority, because here we are thinking about it.\\" So, from the premise that life can evolve by itself (i.e. on naturalistic grounds) given the right planet it follows that our planet has had these right conditions. But of course whether life can or can't evolve by itself on *any* planet is the very question under discussion, so here - again - Dawkins begs the question.     He goes on to discuss the far more serious problem of the apparent fine-tuning of the fundamental physical constants of the universe. It turns out that if these constants (e.g. the value of the strong force) were even a little off then life as we know it could not evolve, so some theists argue that this evidences God's design. Dawkins coyly fails to mention how fine that apparent fine-tuning is: if the combination of physical constants were off only 1 part in 10^100 then life would not have evolved. So how does Dawkins explain that strange state of affairs? He writes (page 145) \\"Once again, the anthropic principle does its explanatory duty\\". So, we are here, naturalism is true, therefore there must be some naturalistic explanation for the whole thing. What explanation exactly? Why, just hypothesize anything no matter how implausible or lacking of evidence as long as it is naturalistic. Amazingly powerful that anthropic principle. Anything out there that naturalism cannot explain? Well, as naturalism is true the anthropic principle will always do its duty as the explanation of last resort. A one-size fits all question begging magic wand.     There is no space to mention the many other fallacies in \\"The God Delusion\\". It basically just recycles the theme that theism is false because naturalism is true, and that naturalism can't have any problems because after all it is true. What's really amazing is that so many people would be inspired by such a superficial book. It seems you don't need to be a religious fundamentalist to be able to switch off your capacity for critical thought and to full heartedly (or foolish heartedly) embrace non-explanations.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Some, especially Beatles purists, will question whether this is a legitimate project with new light to shed on the Beatles songbook, or merely a \\"cash-grab\\" to force yet another egg out of a golden goose.  I think the answer is somewhere in-between.  Though the material motivations are obvious, there's no denying that this is an intriguing way to hear some old favorites in this soundtrack.  Apparently, George Harrison's friendship with the founder of Cirque de Soleil was the seed for this project, and bringing George Martin on board for the production and remix was an inspired but obvious move.  Martin dissects and re-assembles the Fab Four's catalog to create an almost seamless program of \\"mash-ups\\", remixes, musical segues and sound collages.  It's fun for Beatles fans to pick out the snippets of songs contained within other songs. (You'll hear about half a dozen of them, for instance, toward the end of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".)  He also used some of the studio outtakes that can be heard in the Beatles \\"Anthology\\" series, like the a cappella version of \\"Because\\" and John's acoustic demo of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  But the real revelation in this collection is \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  Martin takes Harrison's lovely acoustic demo and backs it with a lush string arrangement, and the result is absolutely gorgeous.  This is by no means an \\"essential\\" collection, any more than the recent \\"1\\" collection or the \\"Let It Be\\" outtakes disc were, but if you're bound and determined to have every Beatles CD release, or you'd like to hear their music in a new and refreshing way, then by all means get it.

Anyway I had to return two torturous returns, one damaged and one not damaged and that is a lot of pain and suffering since I've been waiting to watch this DVD for around 2 weeks now...GEEZ give me a break.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|When I first heard James Blunt's \\"Back to Bedlam\\", the combination of brutally honest lyrics with the searing raw vocals had me immediately hooked.  It is an emotional tour de force that captivates the nerve endings.    One would expect with such a massively successful first album based on years of writing, that the sophomore album cannot be expected to equal.  Well that is not the case.  I expected not to like \\"All the Lost Souls\\" with the same intensity, but there is absolutely nothing to dislike.  Yes, the gripping urgency of the voice has perhaps been tamed just a little, but the tonal sensitivity of each of these interpretations grows on me with every listening.  Of course there are favourites such as \\"I Really Want You\\", but after several listenings I have yet to skip any song just to get to the next.  That speaks volumes about the quality of the art and the strength of the lyrics.  The album is rock solid.    With \\"All the Lost Souls\\", Blunt has managed to move on from the cataclysmic nova of \\"Back to Bedlam\\" as a sensitive and lyrical artist of immense talent.    A fine album in its own right, my guess is that \\"All the Lost Souls\\" will be blessed with a potent and entirely deserved staying power.  James Blunt is most definitely no one-hit wonder.

B0000256VK|5.0|This is an excpetional pop record. Escheewing the arty, treated tensions of their earlier material, Ferry carves out an elegant and inspired collection of songs. For all it's romantic bluster and sophisticated chic, conjuring up imaged of yuppy apartments and the devestated, barren plains of Ferry's hopeless romantic element, _Avalon_ is more than just surface. All the tracks here are nuanced and incredibly subtle, the hooks masterful and the instrumental interplay understated. 'More Than This' might be a call to arms for the 80s Roxy incarnation, but gems like the lilting, pleaful 'While my Heart is Still Beating' exhibit a textural, wonderfully evocative and strangely moving pop I heavn't heard anywhere else. Meanwhile' To Turn You On' is one of the most eerily seductive songs I have ever heard, the graceful chrous is gentle but can't quite conceal the forceful eroticism within. Add to this the memorable title track, with those shimmering guitar licks over the chrous, as well as the tour de force of 'Take a Chance With Me', redolent with completely unexpected instrumental intro, and you have a monumental album indeed.<br /><br />Not quite the well framed art rock of old then, but certainly one of the more graceful albums of the decade, as well as one of the most immaculately produced.

0393061310|4.0|\\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material possessions and technology] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" (p. 14).  Jared Diamond says that this question posed to him by a New Guinean prompted him to write this book.  He seeks to answer why Europeans successfully imposed their empires on people in places like New Guinea, Australia, Africa, and the Americas, instead of being colonized by them.  Why did Western Eurasia come to dominate the other continents rather than become subservient to them?    While many treatments of this subject presuppose some form of racial superiority, Diamond searches for what he calls \\"ultimate explanations\\" (p. 10).  \\"Ultimate\\" for him means evolutionary biology.  He is a professor of geography at UCLA and is a staunch Darwinist.  Social Darwinists of the 19th Century used Darwin's theory of evolution to postulate the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race.      Diamond, however, rejects race, religion, and culture as being relevant to the question of the uneven development that prevails in the modern world.  The answer for him lies in evolutionary biology and geography.  He offers some convincing arguments regarding the process of ancient history; when he tries to explain the modern world, however, that his framework lets him down.    The title \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" comes from the historical fact that those societies that had access to better weapons and technology, or that were more immune to dangerous germs tended to conquer, decimate, or absorb other societies.  To illustrate, Diamond inserts historical accounts where one civilization destroyed or absorbed another.  One account, drawn from eyewitnesses, describes how the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Pizarro annihilated the Inca Empire of King Atahuallpa (p. 69-74).  The Incas had never seen horses before, so were mesmerized by the 62 mounted Spaniards who accompanied 106 foot soldiers.  Furthermore, the South Americans had no guns or steel swords to match those of the Spaniards, but only clubs, maces, axes, and slingshots.  That is how a total of 168 Spanish troops defeated 80,000 Incas and captured Atahuallpa at Cajamarca in 1532.  Even before this one-sided battle, Spanish smallpox had killed the previous Inca King Huayna Capac and most of his court in 1526.  Smallpox spread in an epidemic from Panama in advance of the Spanish armies.  While the Spanish troops had developed immunity to this killer disease, Native Americans had never been exposed to it, and hence were extremely vulnerable to it.      The question for Diamond is, \\"Why did the Spanish have guns, immunity to smallpox, and steel technology, as well as horses, while the Incas had none of these things?\\"  His answer is intriguing, as he traces the history of food production and animal domestication, which he calls \\"a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years\\" (p. 9).  Noting that guns, germs, and steel come from urbanized and industrialized societies, Diamond says that food production is the key to this development.  Whereas Diamond believes that all human societies were originally bands of hunter-gatherers, some areas of the world became centers of food production when wild plants were domesticated and cultivated.  The rise of early societies from bands to tribes to chiefdoms to states depended on the native plants and animals more than on the intelligence or race of the people.      It turns out that the best staple foods and the most easily domesticated animals came from the ancient Fertile Crescent of the Middle East.  Other locations where food production originated included West Africa, Ethiopia, China, New Guinea, Eastern United States, Central America, and the northern part of South America.  While the people of those areas successfully domesticated plants and animals, the available varieties did not compare with those of the Fertile Crescent.   For example, 33 varieties of large-seeded grass species were indigenous to Western Eurasia compared to 23 varieties in the rest of the world (p. 140).  Similarly, Western Eurasia succeeded in domesticating 13 indigenous species of large mammals compared to one species (the llama) in the rest of the world (p. 162).  Despite having 51 indigenous species of large mammals, Africa has never successfully domesticated any of them.  Australia had only the red kangaroo to start with.      By domesticating sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses, Western Eurasia augmented the production of its grains through the use of draft animals and manure for fertilizer.  In addition, these animals were useful for meat, milk, clothing, or for military purposes.  This analysis proves that Western Eurasia had a strong head start in food production and hence in the formation of complex societies.  But what about the diffusion of these advantages to the rest of the world?    Diamond relies on geography to suggest why rapid diffusion of ideas and technology happened in some parts of the world and not in others.  He observes that Eurasia has an east-west axis whereas the Americas and Africa are oriented north-south, and Australia is isolated.  Crops, domesticated animals, and the technology that grew up with them were transmitted from the Fertile Crescent to Ireland in the west and to Japan in the east by the time of Christ.  The fact that this transmission went along the lines of latitude ensured the viability of the crops and animals in their new locations.      In the cases of Africa and the Americas, the north-south axis created obstacles to the diffusion of food production and other advances.  Food that grows well at one latitude may be unsuited to other latitudes.  The transition from temperate climate to tropical also prohibited physical movement as deserts and jungles result from the changing climate.  Thus, South American llamas and potatoes never spread to Central America before Europeans invaded the Americas, because of the tropicalforests between these two regions.  Similarly, Mexican turkeys and sunflowers never arrived in South America.  Even Mexican corn, squash, and beans took several thousand years to reach the Southwest United States because of the intervening desert.  The only draft animals in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans were llamas in South America, so when wheels were invented in Mexico, they remained useful only for children's toys since there were no animals available to pull wagons.  The Mexican wheel never teamed up with the South American llama in the precolonial period.      This lack of diffusion in the Americas also made the people vulnerable to the diseases that the colonial powers would later bring.  Ironically, contagious diseases tend to rise from the close contact between people and domesticated animals, so those places like the Americas, Africa, and Australia that were starved of domesticated animals were also the places where European diseases decimated the indigenous populations.    The Sahara Desert hampered the diffusion of livestock from the Fertile Crescent into Africa.  When these animals did cross that barrier, tropical jungles with tsetse flies, which carry a disease deadly to domesticated livestock, inhibited their spread into southern Africa.  Africa had its own diseases, like malaria, to which Africans had developed immunity but Europeans had not, that prevented Europeans from displacing the original inhabitants to the extent that they did in Australia and the Americas.    Thus, Diamond offers a non-racial analysis that explains well why Eurasia had such a strong head start over other parts of the world in food production, domestication of animals, immunity to diseases, writing, technology, and military conquest.  He has done a great service by showing that the different rates of diffusion of important ideas had nothing to do with the innate intelligence, race, religion, or culture of the people.  In this sense, he has rendered racist theories of history obsolete.  Every race had the ability to develop the same technology, but not the same raw materials.    On the other hand, his analysis is sufficient only up to the time when Europeans conquered much of the world.  After that, previous advantages were lessened by the interchange of ideas, technology, writing, advanced food production, and medical science to most nations.  Today, of course, deserts, jungles, oceans, and even diseases offer little resistance to the spread of new ideas.  So if we are looking for an explanation for the world as we find it today, Diamond has more difficulty with his framework.  For instance, he has trouble using his theory to explain why Europe conquered the world and not China.  Since he uses non-racial Darwinism, there would seem to be no good explanation for how the innate advantages of the Fertile Crescent ended up in Europe more than in China.  Diamond's disregard for religion and culture is a weakness when it comes to the modern world and the differences that we find in it.

He offers a few cautions as well, but the tone of the book implies that rapid decisions are more trustworthy than considered reflection.    While there is some discussion of marketing manipulations and stereotyping, I was hoping for more discussion of the tricks the mind plays on one -- heuristics that lead to reasoning errors, confirmation bias, and the large numbers of eyewitness ID errors among the DNA exoneration cases.    While the book is thought provoking, it may be better read in combination with material on the perils of reflexive decision making.

I think the test was most likely right. So, it was fun and it was somewhat informative...now what? Overall the book didn't give me that much insight on the different categories and the suggestions in some cases contradicted each other. I think it is useful to use in conjunction with additional career books or counselors. It is important to understand your strengths and this may or may not help. Alone, however, I do not think it is enough to give much to the reader.

6305841861|4.0|another one of my favorites, one of the best films out there. evil dead was great, and this sequal was almost just as good. these kinds of movies are the kinds that stand the test of time. they were hilarious and scary then, and not much has changed even now. whether you saw it then or you're a newcomer and saw it now. there are things you'll laugh about, find completely impossible, or just downright think it's stupid, but enjoyable. at the same time you still get those unexpected moments, those shocking scenes, and all that exaggerated blood and gore. wicked movie, but extremely worth every penny. my kind of movie no doubt. the setting is one of the scariest ones. takes place in a creepy old cabin in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but a pich black forest surrounding it. at night it comes alive and the fog swallows everything. this is some good stuff, and let's not forget bruce campbell, got to give the man credit where it's due. he's a great actor and these movies are are a success mainly because of  him. defenitly deserves all the props, and if you haven't seen it yet, you really should.
1582701709|4.0|I applaud The Secret for so many reasons.  It brought to the forefront the power of thought and gave some practical ways to approach it.  Yet, there's more... there's always more!<br /><br />For me, it isn't about the car- the relationship - or the job.  It's about opening my mind to the possibilities that already exist within me.  I only have to believe it to experience it.  Every day, I believe we are given the opportunity to make all things new.  And joy is our natural state of being.<br /><br />I sold my book [[ASIN:0806528400 Never Trust A Man In Alligator Loafers]]  in just three weeks!  That was a publishing \\"impossibility.\\"  Yet, the process of it wasn't easy.  I still worked at my highest ability to achieve it - all the while knowing it was possible.<br /><br />I don't belive The Secret is giving us a \\"get out of jail free\\" card.  Manifesting and proper thinking isn't about skipping out of uncomfortable situations.  We still must expand through them and learn the lesson all the while knowing that there is a greater gift waiting for us than we ever expected.<br /><br />All of the teachers of The Secret are highly embraced now.  Yet, most of them have been at this for decades.  I'm sure it wasn't always rosey.  Or maybe it was!<br /><br />For me the real Secret is the inner knowning that all is well.  Life is fundalmentally good.  I rest in the perfection of spirtual law knowing that as I grow in love so does the world.<br /><br />That's my beauty secret.  And what keeps a smile on my face.  Even on the freeway.
B00006JDVV|5.0|to each his own opinion i guess, but this movie couldn't have been any better than what it was. the cast, the story, the dragons. i don't think i need to say more, but i will. i loved it. it had a good point, that suspense of man against creature, and that bit of action that we all enjoy. it's a time of struggle, and with only a handful of people left, with only their will to survive, and a world full of hungry dragons who will win. a constant battle between man and beast. the fact that this is fantasy and the beauty of the dragons is what makes this movie great. matthew mcconaughey did his thing in this one. that shaved head, that strength, and that psychotic attitude of his fit him like a glove. he knew what he was doing and he was fighting these creatures with a fury seen only in his eyes. excellent role play by this man. let's not forget christian bale, another very talented actor in my book. here he saw the first, and lives with that every day, so he tries his best to be the leader and the only hope these people have. he stays strong and he fights for the survival of mankind. give this man a role and he delivers way better than the average actor. lots of stars for this one, it did it for me.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I'm jaded.      I admit it.      I've always adored the music and sounds from the mouth and mind of Loreena McKennitt.  Following her as she developed her sound...her place...has been a quiet pleasure.    Nights from the Alhambra simply confirms her status as an amazing musician with an equally amazing ear.  I was not sure about the same performances on the DVD and the CDs, but they are truly different and complementary.  The DVD provides the commentary and color not provided on the CD; the CD provides the deepest listening experience.  The same...only different.    While you've heard the songs and music before, the new tempos and the clarity of the mic'ing make the old new once more.    This is a 1-Click buy if ever there was one.    Jonathan Kramer
B00005JKL8|4.0|if you're a war junkie in or around that, then this movie is right for you. war movies are sweet. i guess it's all that intense heat it brings, and the bullets, and the guns, and the running, and the pounding. man they get crazy. and this movie behind enemy lines is up there. this movie never gets boring and it has that drama that draws you in. you feel for this guy going through all this stuff, and you want to help and you just get all into it. that's the thing about movies of war or things like that. some are very deep, while others are just a bit about it, but they all deliver this satisfying thirst for heroism, bravery, and survival. this film is another of those. terrific storyline, the actors worked very well. everyone played their part to the tee, and the end results were very good. owen wilson did a fine job, no doubt. he's acting was so good he was believable. in the navy, as a pilot, on the run, being chased. he had that desperation in his voice, that fear in his eyes. nice job. and as for gene hackman he was the man in charge and even though he portrayed a cold hearted navy officer you could see he cared about this man, and he would do what he could to help him. that is acting. he does it here, and in runaway jury, and enemy of the state just to name a couple. this man is gifted. the movie was good, the actors were great, and any better i doubt it could have been.
B00000DG1R|5.0|I love Duran Duran.  This CD is great for your car, so you can drive along, singing and tapping your foot to the groovy music, however, a few of the songs are edited---the endings are dropped off, i.e., the very end of \\"Rio\\".  Also, I would just like to say that if you like Duran Duran and think that this CD is representative of their work, then you are missing out on some great music.  I especially recommend \\"The Wedding Album\\".
B00000JLWW|5.0|i'm not even going to go into detail about this movie, because i don't think there's anyone who hasn't seen it, or heard about it. one of the best movies ever made no doubt. titanic, is a piece of history brought to life on the big screen, and adding a sweet romance to it became a sensation all across the globe. it was a tragedy what happened to this beautiful ship, and especially to all the people on board who lost there lives in this disaster. i can't even imagine what they went through. one minute you're safe and warm, and the next you're fighting for your life. everything is so well and organized according to class, but in the end there's nothing but chaos, and in death there is no class. very real, very sad, and very emotional. the fact that it's hugely based on real events makes it that much more painful. in this movie they bring all that and add a little touch of romance. leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet. beautiful couple, excellent chemistry, and a very believable romance. at all cost they want to be together. it's that love at first sight that surpasses class, fedelity, and wealth. there's not a care in the world as long as they have each other.(sigh)now that's great movie making. they both shot to stardom after these roles. titanic made them who they are. billy zane was a great villian. he did all he could to make her love him, but you can't control matters of the heart. the way the story is told was a great idea, the old rose retelling the best days of her life, wich she shared with the love of her life. then she goes in peace to reunite with her jack. brilliant. lovely. great. if you haven't seen it, i do not know where you've been, but it's defenitely an A+.
0345494997|4.0|What a great read.  I found myself inside this very sad and traumatic love story.
0753820250|5.0|A bestseller in Spain for five years running -- it's actually the most successful Spanish novel since DON QUIXOTE -- this breathtaking debut is at once a sprawling Gothic, a coming-of-age tale, a love letter to literature, a portrayal of a city recovering from madness, and a heartbreaking romance.<br /><br />The story that ties all this together is the quest to discover the truth about a brilliant but nearly forgotten author, whose books seem to be spilling over into the life of the young protagonist. The novel beautifully evokes a Barcelona suffering from the aftermath of war, peopled with characters rich and fantastic. Usually I'm nervous about tackling a 500-page epic originally written in another language, but this one had me from the first line. It's touching, compelling, passionate, funny, and tremendous fun to read.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|it is so difficult to say what fugazi release is their best. for me, it's this or repeater. i love them both, but for totally different reasons. the songwriting on this album is incredible, damn near perfect i think. yes, it's different from the rest of the stuff they've done in the past, but all fugazi albums are like that.     if you need one reason to buy this, it's for break. easily, the best fugazi song ever recorded.
0345479092|5.0|i picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, and i was not disappointed.  the author is a baby nurse and has a \\"special\\" way with newborns and infants, and is passing along her wisdom and experiences in this book.  i found myself agreeing with everything she had to say, and have implemented her \\"e-a-s-y\\" way of caring for infants with my new baby. i also agree with the s-l-o-w technique to determine what your baby might need (why are they crying?), to avoid stuffing a pacifier in their mouth at the first sign of fussiness.  one thing to note, my baby is a \\"textbook\\" baby, and it was fairly simple for us to implement these techniques.  for people with colicy or super fussy babies, using this book may be more difficult and take longer to implement.  ultimately, i totally agree with giving a baby a routine (not an inflexible schedule), and for treating babies like the people they are, and respecting them and their personal space.   i highly recommend this book!
B000N3SS80|5.0|Como Ama Una Mujer is an amazing piece of work, if Laura Branigan had ever recorded a spanish album, i would put my bets on it, that this is how it would sound like. You could really feel the growth in Jennifer Lopez's voice and the maturity in the lyrics! i really won't be surprised if this album becomes a classic.     1.Que Hiciste- A very strong opening to the album, you can actually feel the wrath in her voice, especially when you're reading the lyrics and looking at that amazingly beautiful picture of hers right next to it. and at the same time your wondering: how is it that such a beauty could be pouring out her heart with so much sorrow and pain! 10/10     2.Me Haces Falta-This could easily become anyone's favorite song, the guitars are put together phenomenally. I am COMPLETLY in LOVE with this song because of lyrics and the beat! This song should be a single. 10/10     3.Como Ama Una Mujer-I could really see Latin superstar Lucero singing this song back in her days. it has this 90's Spanish epic ballad feel to it. 10/10     4.Te Voy A Querer-a semi-upbeat song. i really like how they used accordions to creat this stong mysterious sound, and the chorus is quite catchy. 10/10     5.Porque Te Marchas-I love both the English and Spanish versions of this song. Its just such a powerful and moving track. 10/10     6.Por Arriesgarnos- when you first hear Jennifer sing, it sounds like something you hear in a fairy-tale. It's quite touching how both Marc Anthony and Jennifer's voices merge with eachothers 10/10     7.Tu- WOW!! Tu is such an AMAZING love song, you can feel the conviction in her voice with every word she sings. everytime i listen to this song it sends shivers down my spine! The vocals are amazing! 10/10     8.Amarte Es Todo- a smooth powerful epic love ballad that showcases Jennifer's vocals excuisetly. 10/10     9.Apresurate-I really really like this song, it has an amazing vibe to it. 10/10     10.Sola- This is such a haunting song. it sounds like she doesn't give a damn about anything, and like she's at the brink of a breakdown. i love when se sings \\"y esta vez disparaste a matar\\" and then goes into the chorus. it just sounds so convoluted! 10/10     11.Adios-Jennifer could have not picked a better song to end this gorgously crafted masterpiece. Her vocals and the choir really give it \\"goodbye\\" sort of feeling, especially when she sings, \\"adios me voy adios/ y no me dejas ni tan solo una esperanza/ adios amor adios. 10/10     Overall Como Ama Una Mujer is a roughly enjoyable album for everyone.   It's definatley worth every dollar!
B000PMG16U|5.0|Here is the thing on this i am a recent Bluray guy and a big star wars fan. Of course this will sell like hot cakes. However i disagree with the review earlier about nailing the HD wars. From the looks of it this war will go on for a long long time. But its ok folks i found a nifty little solution for this.  Take the one standard that you feel, see, analyzed and understood and stick with it.  Invest good money into that player (look for HDMI ver 1.3 on the new upcoming players either HD or Bluray) the alternative format just buy a cheap used player to compensate for those hard to get titles.  I had invested good money into a Pioneer elite model [[ASIN:B000RO7FA2 Pioneer Elite BDP-94HD - Blu-Ray disc player]] which does a superb job with my chosen Bluray format.  After a few month of savings for HD-DVD i bought a used  [[ASIN:B000E1PTGK Toshiba HD-A1 HD-DVD Player]] which does a nice job with those discs.<br /><br />Conclusion was: i got both formats for less than the new LG combo player which has its own issues.  I will tell u this may sound lavish but it isn't.<br /><br />Sometimes the studios and this is a true story, will release thing like Terminator 1&2 in Blueray. However to watch T3 u need an HD player!<br /><br />Now back to Lucas. Knowing how much of an audio person he is (after all the whole THX thing was no joke) and that extra 15gb's on blue will really help the lossless audio on it, i have a feeling they will go Blueray. However a second release would also be available on HD i am sure; Star Wars has a large base all over the world so better please them all.<br /><br />On a side note: in the Middle East and even some parts of Asia, mainly Bluray is whats taking shape. There is no awareness on efforts placed for HD-DVD formats whatsoever. In this part of the world we even saw bluray being sold through chain stores officially but no HD-DVD.  Thats a big sign on its own of whats coming.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I am sure that there was some bizarre legal reason why they had to re-use the plot of Thunderball -even with the same names - for Connery's return.  While I grew up on Connery's Bond and think he is by far the best (just like 60s rock is the best!!), it is beyond me why they couldn't come up with something more original for his swan song.  Roger Moore just could NEVER measure up to Connery, who is a wonderful actor, believable yet under-stated, and always adding creative detail.  Unfortunately, this is so tightly scripted and directed that little of Connery's creativity comes through.  The result is a plodding re-hash, really exactly the same story, just updated with suitably nubile younger women.  (Bassinger and Carrera are indeed wonderful and alluring, and Connery isn't awful, but he alks through this rather indifferently).  It is just that I had hoped for much much more.
1594489505|5.0|I won't go into much detail as it has already been stated by many viewers. Yes, it is disturbing to see how women are/were treated in such an oppressive culture. But just because it is disturbing doesn't mean that the novel is terrible. It's a great novel - a great read. The style in which it is written is fabulous! Switching between characters for their insights and viewpoints is great.  I think Hosseini did a great job in intertwining his story with real events in Afghanistan. Just because you like the book doesn't mean you support the ill-treatment of people - women especially. It means that you recognize a well-written story.

B000SO7OL6|4.0|(4 & 1/2 stars)  This new Diana Krall best-of CD does what you would hope any best-of would do.  That is, it plays like a near-perfect collection of songs where just about every cut entertains at a high level.  The songs are sequenced very well, with up-tempo numbers mixed in to spice up the slower and more romantic music.  So you get to hear \\"Let's Fall In Love,\\" with its fabulous guitar-and-vocal intro (Russell Malone  ([[ASIN:B0001MZ7JQ Playground]]) on guitar) leading right into \\"The Look of Love,\\" a great Bacharach cover.  And so on.  All feature the ultracool and exquisite vocals of Ms Krall, and her piano playing's not too bad either.  The real highlights for her fans are the three previously unreleased tracks, songs from the sessions for two of her previous albums.  Each of them is good enough to belong on this best-of (a fairly rare thing for a hits collection).  I particularly enjoyed \\"You Go To My Head,\\" which has both a wonderful orchestral arrangement by Claus Ogerman AND some tasty piano lines from Diana.  This album will make a great christmas gift for the jazz fan on your list.  I kind of wish I had bought the deluxe edition with DVD [[ASIN:B000T2PRF2 The Very Best of Diana Krall]], but this music is great anyway.<br /><br />PS - I wanted to title this review with a pun on the lady's last name, such as \\"Krall, Don't Run\\" or \\"Pub Krall,\\" but those wouldn't have made sense, right?

B000VNMMR0|5.0|In \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\",for the fourth time,we meet John McClane (Bruce Willis). While John McClane's past work in treacherous situations has earned McClane the honor of Senior detective,his personal life has fallen apart. This is courtesy of John McClane's divorce from the woman whom we know as Holly,and his two children(John Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character of Lucy McClane)no longer speaking to him.    And then,one night,John McClane's life takes a sudden turn around into precariousness. This is when the last minute arrest that John McClane has to make of a computer hacker by the name of Matt Farrell(Justin Long)puts McClane face to face with a man who matches the characteristics of a person that the U.S. would fear. That man is Thomas Gabriel(Timothy Olymphant),who has the computer infrastructure and the world at the tip of his fingers,and can permanently damage both at any time. Now,with the assistance of Matt Farrell,it is up to John McClane to save America(as well as his own daughter)by defeating Thomas Gabriel and going through some of the detrimental and fearful obstacles that he has encountered before(need I say when and how?)with success,intelligence,and an appropriate amount of style.    \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is a top-notch film that fits perfectly into the \\"Die Hard\\" series. \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" successfully recaptures the action and suspense that one got out of \\"Die Hard\\",while succeeding in the action and suspense not recycling the action and suspense that was in DH,and at the same time,keeping everything entertaining. There is plenty of comedy in \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" that remains true to the comedy that you would find in any film that sits in the genres of comedy and action/comedy,without going overboard. To top it all off,\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" allows itself to be straightforward and realistic. This is by \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" being \\"honest\\" towards the kind of real life situation that it is dealing with,but at the same time,not choking on what is known as crime drama or becoming too much of a reality that people fear. Add all of this together,and you have an irreproachable film that carries the same beauty that \\"Die Hard\\" was able to carry. That beauty? A plausible(if you are able to look past some of the action sequences)film that successfully combines reality with action,never failing to entertain and successfully keeping itself from being a giddy action film.    There are actually two unrated DVD versions of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" that are being released on DVD(the other two not being unrated). One two disc set,and one with only one disc. As we wait to learn ***all*** of the special feautures that will be on these two DVD versions of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\"(which will be released on November 20),I recommend pre-ordering the two disc set(for more special feautures,unless you want to save money). But,either way,it doesn't really matter. Why? Because the unrated version of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" takes the theatrical version of LFDH and gives fans more of what they were hoping to get out of a non PG-13 rated version of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\"!!!!    Overall,the best film in the \\"Die Hard\\" series(in my opinion),and a DVD that remains true to the \\"Die Hard\\" series and gives \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" and fans of the DH series what they really want and deserve--a proficient action film that is what it deserves to be,not an action film that is cleaned up(despite how good \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" turned out to be and still is).
1577314808|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  It's somewhat cerebrally written but not academically so that it's too obtuse.  Tolle does a great job of talking about \\"now\\" and getting out of your mind and into your life.  I'd recommend it for everyone.
1582701709|5.0|Reading the Secret was a wonderful and enlightening experience.  I am a very open minded person, you must be to be to recieve insight.    I am a devote believer, thus I had to really open my mind to recieve this information, you have to be so careful not to read things that may lead you astray.    However the Secret actually helped me to really understand who I am, who I belong to, the power that belongs to me as a believer.    I believe that one of the Seals were opened, as I read the Secret my eyes were opened  to understanding the Bible.  All my life I was exposed to the Secret, but not really understanding or utilizing it to my full potential.  Reading is wisdom and I now know why slaves were not allowed to read, too many secrets were being revealed,if they were allowed to read the Bible they would have become wise and slavery would have ceased immediately. Lincoln would never have had to Free Slaves, they would have freed themselves long ago,    The Secret takes absolutely nothing from the Bible that we have studied, it actually helps you understand what you already know in more detail but perhaps didn't apply.      In the Bible the Scripture indicates that God word is going to spread throughout the  world, not many would be able to say they didn't know the truth.  God would use the stones if necessary to worship Him and His words.  The Secret is one of the stones. By any means necessary His work would get out. People rarely pick up their Bibles, but they will pick up the Secret,  this will lead them to at least see if what is written in the Secret is true, They will pick up the Bible just to see if it says anything that was written in the Secret.    Now the Secret refers to God as the Universe, well that is exactly what He is.  They speak about energy, well God is energy, He is a spirit, He is a life force, and their is much more, but people will miss out because they are afraid  of using the third eye, the mind opener.  The Secret speaks of healing, love, giving, caring, sharing, I didn't read one word that spoke of evil,hate only how wonderful and beautiful we are.    This no Science Space age book, don't be closed minded, you read the newspaper daily and it is full of lies and deception, why not read something that tells you that the world is full of abundance, love, health, caring  and that you are heir to all if you use your mind to change things for the better.    I thank these authors for sharing this information with the world.  They do nothing but give.  They ask  nothing in return.    Secret - definition - Something hidden - If it is all false - why hide it.    People hide the truth to keep it to themselves.    My Life has changed since I have read and understand the Secret     The authors are all very spiritual and caring people at least I found out for myself.  I refuse to miss out on anything else because I was closed minded.  The book is a gift.    Read it - Get the CD - Or Watch it on Cable
038533348X|4.0|Worth the read, particularly if you want to \\"try\\" Vonnegut.  I did this for a book club and it worked quite well since there are infinite interpretations to pretty much every word of Vonnegut.  It's hard to say what it's about other than it's a great outlook on apocalypse.

Trying to create high art that lives up to the legacy of greatness of those who came before. The mixture of Bebop and Hiphop is a win win combination. The entire jazzmatazz series will become a long living classic to be coveted by fans of good music well into the future.
0743243153|1.0|The book was a collection of run-on sentences. The author appearently, has only a passing aquaintence with periods. The most dissapointing aspect of the book was the title. It is written from the perspective, of an upper, middle class, conservative christian; harly the road less traveled. Unfortunatly, the lowest rating you can give is one star; what a waste of money!
B000R8YC18|5.0|There is no other way to describe this DVD than just saying flawless.

I'm glad I waited this long to finally buy this movie.
B000I2J2WM|2.0|Don't buy the HD-DVD version. It has been butchered into a 1.66:1 format, making a nonsense of the multi-image sequences, and the director's original panoramic vision. The standard, and cheaper,  2 disc edition looks exceptionally good on an HD-DVD player and presents the film in more or less the full, original Ultra-Panavison ratio.
0316010669|1.0|I bought this book just because of all the noise surrounding it as being one of the best sellers, etc. Well, all what this book is saying is that you should trust your subconscious because your first impression or decision is basically your best .

B0000UJDLM|5.0|This movie is still funny and it is a riot to see these actors as they were.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|Features 2 new extras: \\"Troy In Focus\\" a 23 minute interview and a new 5 minute introduction by Wolfgang Peterson. Most of the other special features have been ported over from the previous edition.<br /><br />First the most important question is whether or not this double dip is worth it? Absolutely because the additional footage only enhances the film giving it additional depth. The transfer is striking (regardless of which format)as well. In many respects this isn't a double dip because we get a film that is superior to the original version.<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Illiad\\" Wolfgang Petersen's film \\"Troy\\" seemed too short and for good reason; Petersen had to trim the film down to a shorter length for its theatrical release. Luckily Warner gave Petersen the opportunity to revisit this epic film and add more meat to the bones of a film that had the look of an epic but was missing much of the emotional depth.<br /><br />Petersen restores roughly 32 minutes to the film giving additional depth to the various relationships in the film. While \\"Troy\\" isn't a perfect epic, it's much improved. James Horner's score is still occasionally obtrusive but the overall impact of Petersen's film with its marvelous performances from Brian Cox (who steals almost every scene he's in), the quiet power of Eric Bana and even the gravity of Pitt as Achilles is far more effective than the previous version.<br /><br />Image quality is superb for both the DVD and Blu Ray verisons of the film (the Blu Ray, of course, gets the nod because the images are much sharper, crisper with better definition but the DVD isn't too shabby either). Audio for the Blu Ray is presented lossless while the DVD's audio sounds terrific given the limitations of the format. Colors are a bit bolder here than on the previous version to my eyes.<br /><br />It appears that a lot of the special features from the previous edition have been ported over and the only new things are the introduction by Petersen as well as a retrospective 23 minute interview where Petersen discusses the genesis of the original film and this project.<br /><br /> This film version much more closely resembles what he had in mind when he took on the project. Greek mythology purists will find some of the changes disturbing but some of the changes enhance the film pulling the strands of the story together a little tighter.tersen discusses the genesis of the original film and this project.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|Yes, I will say what many have already said, but I don't think that it can be reiterated enough. I just saw the DVD release of Death Proof, and though Death Proof is a wonderfully imagined and executed film that kicks some serious butt, its content is feeble and inferior in comparison with past Tarantino films. As only part of the release of Grindhouse, the deleted scenese have been added back in. This creates a movie that is too long with a premise that is spread far too thin, and one realises it was a better film when these scenes were left out. It is too much, but at the same time not enough. The original cut of Death Proof was perfect and worked beautifully with Planet Terror and the faux trailers that made up the theater release known as Grindhouse. Grindhouse was a masterpiece, an homage to trash, cult film that worked because its various parts added up to a single, fantastic whole. These films are based upon Grindhouse cinema, they are in and of themselves cheap, exploitation films and the directors know that, they love these kinds of films, and what they created in the theater was not just a movie but a theater experience. They created a context in which movies like these are to be viewed and they reminded us, the audience, what is so delicious and fun about going to see movies like this in the first place. Alone, Death Proof is like watching one half of a movie, what is the point of that? Death Proof and Planet Terror need to be Grindhouse, by themselves, they truly are little more than the low budget horror films that they are homage too (which I don't usually think are worthwhile), they are below the tour de force that Tarantino and Rodriguez usually to a cinematic experience, only when they are together in the Grindhouse package does the genius begin to spark. Grindhouse was one of the best movie releases this summer, if this film is not somehow released in its original form, it will be  a terrible loss to Tarantino and Rodriguez fans and to cinema in general.

B000J233SK|5.0|This was the first CD that introduced me to the enchanting music of Loreena McKennitt. I was blown away by her music! She's a great story teller through her lyrics and and they go beautifully with different exotic instruments. It led me to purchase additional works of this talented artist. Great music!
1416523359|5.0|It's sad when readers criticize a book because it's not like an author's previous books. To those who couldn't get into the book because it isn't like King's previous titles, I suggest giving it another try--reading it with no expectations and letting the book stand on its own. It's an emotional, highly imaginative, and entertaining love story, above all else. I'm not a big fan of horror or fantasy, but I, for one, was sorry when I finished this lengthy book.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|After being introduced to Loreena McKennitt by a previous CD and really enjoying it I decided to purchase this CD/DVD. Loreena and her band sound just as good live as they do in the studio. It exceeded my expectations! The setting of the concert, an historic building with stunning Moorish architecture in Alhambra, Spain is gorgeous and it's just perfect for this type of music! The talented Loreena sings as well as plays three different instruments and the musicians in her band just blew me away with their exotic instruments. Great concert, next best thing to being there!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I recently had the chance to see this show in London.  I am not a big fan of musicals (especially when people spontaneously break into song over something mundane...the likes of 'they got the mustard out!') but this show totally won me over.  I was really impressed with the whole thing-the music is quite likeable-even if you haven't seen the show- and the vocals are really amazing on quite a few tracks.  I would see this show again-and I'd even take people who are committed anti-musical types...I think it would win them over.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has managed to put out another great CD. This is a must for any Loreena's fans. Her music is still magical and her story telling is still fascinating!
0312305060|5.0|After seeing the movie nearly two years ago, I read the Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Hours.  I was intrigued with the story and eagerly anticipated certain scenes before starting the book.  Even with the prior knowledge of the plot, I was not disappointed in the least.  Michael Cunningham's sentences flow with ease, gracefully taking the reader through three stories.  The set up of the story is simple: a day in the life of three women in three different locations and time periods.  No one story or woman is more significant than the others; each is intertwined and dependant to the others.<br /><br />As an avid fan of Virginia Woolf's work, including Mrs. Dalloway, I have come to love the stream of conscious writing style. Cunningham pays homage to Woolf, her distinct writing style, and, of course, to her seminal work Mrs. Dalloway.  Cunningham takes Woolf's style and reinvents it to a modern day version.  Unlike the modernist writers that started anew and broke from tradition like Woolf did, Cunningham reuses the famous story of Mrs. Dalloway and Woolf's brilliant writing style in a different and, in some respects, more profound way.  I think Cunningham achieved this through the seemingly trivial details and other lesser known characters.<br /><br />One particular that brought the story together is Lara Brown's son, Richard.  Through Richard, Cunningham takes on the contentious Oedipus Complex and unearths the roots of older Richard's psychological instability.  Richard's indefatigable desire to be loved by his mom is incredibly poignant and tragic.  While I badly want Lara to love Richard back like the way he loves her, I understand Lara's inner dilemma and empathize with her. It's almost magic the way Cunningham makes it easy to sympathize with Lara, a monster of a mother. I know many other writers have accomplished this feat, but it's still amazing to me.  Richard is seen as the aftermath, the destruction that is caused by a mother that thinks independently and, at times, selfishly.  This is not to say that Cunningham advocates for the antithesis: a mother that avoids her inner voices for independence and freedom.  His frequent reference to Woolf's opening line, 'Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself', makes that evident; it is a declaration for the rights of women in some sense. Nonetheless, Cunningham presents both sides without taking a stance on either one, leaving it up to the readers to make their own conclusion.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this book even if you've seen the movie.  And if you have read The Hours, read Mrs. Dalloway and watch the movie!selfishly.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|Folks QT and RR mentioned that the DVDs would be released as separate films. Grindhouse experience was only for the theater as it was back in the days. They are trying to do the real thing. I'm sure you wouldn't be able to find any grindhouse B-movies from 70s & 80s in video together with its double-bill partner movie. So this is part of the whole Grindhouse rule that QT and RR are following.<br /><br />I loved the whole experience but I have been really looking forward to see those purposely deleted scenes from the theater being included in the DVD releases, especially the lap dance sequence in \\"Death Proof\\". I read lot of the fans of Grindhouse are crying 'cash-cow' for Weinstein Company releasing the movies separately but we have to understand that they took a huge risk funding these films and it tanked huge in the Box office. So they deserved to make some money from the fans but ultimately QT and RR never wanted to release both films together in DVD.

B000SNUMC0|4.0|That Jon Schaffer is a busy busy man when he does these things but why does he seemingly retread the old stuff over again when his Epic of the<br />Civil War 'The Glorious Burden' was so good. The concepts he comes up with are sometimes phenominal and I wish he'd keep it up. But trust that I am NOT being critical even though it sounds like I am. I love his band and his stuff and want to eventually see them live in concert even though I own his 'Live in Athens'.

B0000844IT|5.0|Ashe is back once again in this third installment of the Evil Dead Trilogy!  This third installment is higher budget(albeit the special effects are dated of course) yet and much funnier than the last one!  This time we see Ashe traveling back in time to 1300 AD England to retrieve the original \\"Book Of The Dead\\" and of course save the day once again.  While only the original was worth a watch there are such great bonuses as some deleted scenes that never got used in either version.  The original theatrical release as we know is hilarious,action-packed, clever and quotable whereas the Director's Cut I will grant you did come up with some more funny scenes of Ashe being tortured by his miniature selves that's about all it offered.  Not to mention they really screwed up the ending.  So in closing the original version of Army of Darkness was clever however the Director's Cut is only worth one look.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|More of what you expect from the most original band on the planet.  Another step up from Get Behind Me Satan.  Simply flawless.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|As a movie, 300 is near perfect.  And with HD DVD you get the \\"Look and Sound of Perfect\\", so what can I say except 300 is the perfect HD DVD.  One warning:  This movie is not for the squeamish.

B000GW8RX4|4.0|Sound and picture quality are not great, but the lengthy and frequent soloing by Mr.Blackmore is a combination of melodic tact and balls out fret burning.Rainbow delivers some of their best material, all before their foray into 80's pop-metal.  The band is tight. I never liked Dio so much as a vocalist but I can understand Blackmore's appreciation of his range and soul. Late, great Cozy Powell controls the skins like few drummers can.  I wished they opted for an instrumental \\"Still I'm Sad\\" here, as their recording was. A better video transfer job (audio was OK) and few Deep Purple cuts may have pushed this to a 5th star.  But from what I hear, Blackmore was even more fiercely independent and perfectionist in those days and wanted to do it all his own way. Catch the 1974 California Jam video also!
B00000F14B|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  The energy and staging of this movie captured the esssence of Music Man while setting it in a movie setting vs Broadway.  I love the stage version also.
1582701709|1.0|I read this book because some of my patients have been taking it quite seriously and reported that they could derive some health benefits or elements of hope. I had serious concerns that they might be being led down an imaginative pathway that could precipitously lead to disappointment and cause psychological suffering. Unfortunately, the book and DVD, in my opinion, consist of misrepresentations and mainly consist of pseudoscience. The quotes are out of context and the narrative is not eloquent. It is the nightmare book for all those who are serious about the credibility of mind/body medicine. Surprisingly, successful authors, such as Canfield of Chicken Soup for the Soul fame, and others in the positive affirmation industry, taunt those who have not been so successful in life by stating that they \\"do not visualize enough dollars!\\" The worse scenario is the suggestion that \\"breast cancer can be cured by watching comical movies\\"...an extrapolation from Norman Cousins having alleged to cure himself \\"of a fatal illness\\" (ankylosing spondylitis and associated heart disease) with comedy...hardly scientific, and potentially dangerous. Most of the latter part of the book is taken up with self-congratulatory adverts for the contributors who are mainly in the so-called \\"positive affirmation industry\\". I have no problem with affirmative thinking, and some quotes from learned people such as Einstein, are valid when taken in their original context...but, please, this book (and DVD) should have a health warning attached. Please do not take this book at its face value...the only secret seems to be that it is intended to cajole innocent readers (or viewers) into making a lot of money for its various authors (or presenters). The only positive aspect of the book is the quality of the parchment and graphics....the one star. If you want to read appropriate affirmation, my secret to you is to read credible and medically-qualified authors, such as Rachel Naomi Remen MD.

B000PMGS8G|4.0|Ahhh Ahhhh Flash!  My wife and I love these great 80's cult classics.  The music by Queen is awesome!  The special effects were respectable for the day but it was the mix of romance and humor that is the most entertaining part of this movie.  The packaging leaves a little to be desired, we were hoping for a glossy color information pull out cover with juicy information about the movie, maybe words to the songs and some fun pictures, but it is fairly plain, just a 5\\"x7\\" card with a black and white comic book sketch.  If you enjoy music by Queen or the semi-cheesy 80's cult classic style movies I would say Flash Gordon (Saviour of The Universe) is a big thimbs up.
1594489505|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. I found the characters to be richly drawn and complex.  The way the setting and era are described are part of what drives the story.  These women's lives are so dependant upon the environment they live in, that without the amazing narrative...it wouldn't work.  I highly recommend this book for any one wanting a good read and anyone searching for a glimpse into the life of women in Afghanistan.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If I cheered as long and as loud as I wanted to for this movie, I would loose my voice for a month and everyone around me would have temporary hearing loss!  A movie with something to say?  From the point of view of the most imperfect and downtrodden of a society?  A movie with wry humor and sharp wit that treats its audience as if we have brains?!?!  Yes, Yes and YES!  Not that I would expect anything else from Joss Whedon.  His script is brilliant and his cast a wonder.  Buy this movie for yourself and everyone you know!

I was never much of a Crue fan when they were in their prime, but as I got older, I started to like their music and enjoyed reading about their beginning and the typical crazy road that most rock stars take.
0060558121|2.0|After hearing so much about this book, I thought it would be only fair to read it a few years after it has been out.  But as another reviewer already wrote, this book is \\"numbingly SEDENTARY\\".  It's painful to read as there are sentences that don't belong.  There are too many \\"gods\\" who disappear and really have no significance.  Basically, it's about a bunch of people (who are gods), that sit around, drink coffee, smoke, and bull.  Really.<br /><br />I can't believe I paid for this crap.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because the Gods idea is cool.

B00000269G|5.0|Ok, the sound's thin and distant. Other than that, this couldn't be much better.<br />One of the greats at his greatest, this belongs beside the very best of Powell, Shearing, Peterson, Tatum, and Evans. High praise but not hyperbole; Erroll has The Touch, and imagination for days. Autumn Leaves is almost hilariously florid and supple; he's not afraid to unwind all the way. No one else ever played that chestnut quite like this...<br />If there's a jazz bar in heaven, Garner takes the happy hour shift.
0307387178|5.0|I read this book when it came out and now I'm hearing that the Sean Penn movie is framed making the protagonist a hero and unlucky wilderness adventurer. That's not the book I read! I thought Krakauer did a stupendous job crafting a cautionary tale about stupidity and danger. There is no glory in dying a needless death. My husband is a 30 year outdoor educator, former Outward Bound and NOLS instructor. While he read it, I heard him say \\"what a moron!\\" about 100 times. We both agree that Krakauer tightens the noose brilliantly until the ugly death. Terrific writing about a bubble wrapped,naive suburban boy trapped in a web of his own idiocy.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this version of Pride and Prejudice. If you are a fan of the book you will be in for a shock; there is a lot of \\"Artistic License\\" taken in this film.   Kiera Knightly is a very pretty girl but, let's face it, she can not act.  She is constantly giggling in this movie in an obvious and over-acted way. It is very obnoxious. She is an extremely poor actress. They make Elizabeth out to be bookish and unkempt. In the book Elizabeth said herself that she is \\"Not a great reader\\" but that is exactly what they make her out to be in this film.  She is not the only one in this adaptation that seems to struggle. Every time the girl who plays Lydia came on to the screen I wanted to throw something at it. She had a very over-acting-extremely-fake-British-accent. Someone really needs to tell her that overacting belongs on the stage. On Screen it is supposed to look like you are not acting.  I was most disappointed that they destroyed the relationship that Elizabeth had with her sister Jane. In the book they were very close and in this movie they are no more than roommates.  There are two redeeming things in this movie; which is why I gave it two stars instead of none. 1)Tom Hollander does a fabulous and hilarious job of being Mr Collins. He knows how to act, in fact he is a fantastic actor. 2) Mr. Darcy. In this version he is much more passionate about Elizabeth than in any other version I have ever seen.   If you can stand it; see the film and watch the two leading men shine in their roles.
0446677450|2.0|This book really opened my eyes to the fact that you can't be a wage slave all your life, so thanks for that. BUT, and this is a big but, Kiosaki is at heart a huckster. Research it online and you find \\"Rich Dad\\" doesn't exist. Kiosaki made him up. Once you realize this you realize that there's no lessons from a genius entrepreneur/investor but rather the whimsical musings of one man who made his fortune giving speeches and taking people's money in seminars. In interview after interview, he refuses to cite a single real-estate deal or concrete comapny he invested in - it's all nebulous and contradictory, just like his life story. So go ahead, buy a used copy for a buck or two, be inspired, but don't be sucked in. And whatever you do, don't pay for his \\"Rich Dad Coaching\\" scam through his website. I would, however, recommend getting the Cashflow 101 game, but NOT 202.
B00000266S|5.0|Great soundtrack!  This is one of the best soundtracks of all time and the music is just wonderful.  This is rock and pop at its best and the songs just can't be beat.  If you enjoy good music from the eighties then you will enjoy this.  Check out songs such as \\"Danger Zone\\" and \\"Playing with the Boys\\", both by Kenny Loggins, as well as \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\" by Loverboy, \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" by Miami Sound Machine, \\"Take My Breath Away\\" by Berlin, \\"Mighty Wings\\" by Cheap Trick, and the beautiful \\"Top Gun Anthem\\" by Harold Faltermeyer & Steve Stevens.  Don't forget the other songs that are all just as good, such as \\"Destination Unknown\\" by Marietta, \\"Through the Fire\\" by Larry Greene, and \\"Lead Me On\\" by Teena Marie.  Every song on this album is a gem, and again one of the best soundtracks of all time.  This is worth having in any serious music collection.  Excellent music!

B00005JNEW|5.0|WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!<br /><br />I haven't read the book, but I did see the movie.  Has anyone noticed some of the blatant inaccuracies in it?<br /><br />(see below)<br /><br />First of all, Permian did not even advance to the state championship game in 1988.  They lost to Dallas Carter 14-9 in the semis.  Carter went on to beat Converse Judson for the state title, 31-14, but was later stripped of the title due to using an ineligible player (I believe this was the team that Jesse Armstead played on).<br /><br />Also, there is no way Permian played Dallas Jesuit in the early rounds of the '88 playoffs, as indicated in the movie.  Jesuit is a Catholic school, which have their own playoffs (TCIL) as opposed to the public schools (UIL).  And even in cases where Jesuit plays public schools, Jesuit would be classified as a 4A school, not 5A like Permian.<br /><br />Here is the playoff path for each team:<br /><br />Bi-dist: Permian 31 Amarillo Tascosa 7  Carter 21 Plano East 7<br />Area:  Permian 41 El Paso Andress 13  Carter 28 Dallas Samuell 0<br />Region:  Permian 48 Irving Nimitz 7  Carter 31 Lufkin 7<br />Quarter: Permian 21 Arlington Lamar 7  Carter 22 Marshall 18<br />Semis:  Carter 14 Permian 9<br /><br />Again, I don't know if the book made these mistakes, or if this was \\"poetic license\\" on the part of the screenwriters.  I can see how putting Permian in the state championship game is more dramatic, but why couldn't they simply stick to the facts?  Losing in the semis is pretty dramatic, too.<br /><br />OTOH, if movie viewers recall Carter's disqualification, they might rightly ask why Permian wasn't awarded the '88 5A title; and of course, the answer would be: because they didn't make the finals. Judson did, and *they* were awarded the title upon Carter's disqualification.<br /><br />There *is* one thing the movie got right: Permian *did* win state in 1989.<br /><br />Fred Goodwin<br />HS sports curmudgeon

B000R7HY0K|5.0|This is one half of Quentin Tarantino's stylized homage to the dollar theater, GRINDHOUSE, expanded, but without the faux movie trailers.<br /><br />DEATH PROOF has all the blobs, crackles, changes of hue and missing reels that you would expect of any low-budget schlock film that had made the rounds of the so-called \\"grindhouses,\\" those sticky-seated, torn-screen movie palaces with popcorn mutating under the seats, places that showed forgotten classics like PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE.<br /><br />DEATH PROOF is not about a car that eats people, it's about a car that kills people. Kurt Russell plays the deranged Stuntman Mike, who likes to take his specially-adapted car (deathproofed with a harness and roll cage for the driver, and a huge death's-head painted on the hood) and smash it at full speed into cars carrying pretty young girls. The violence and gore is pure classic Tarantino: Burlesqued grotesque.<br /><br />Stuntman Mike always walks away. They don't.<br /><br />They don't that is, until the scarred Stuntman Mike runs afoul of a car driven by a pair of female stunt drivers (Stuntwoman Zoe Bell stars as herself). At first he gets the drop on them, but when they realize he means to kill them they engage him in an amazing eighteen minute high speed chase scene reminiscent of BULLITT, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE SEVEN UPS, and others too numerous to mention, after which the girls take their revenge. It's a case history of Female Empowerment as seen through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />Just like the films it pays homage to, DEATH PROOF starts out with it storyline meandering along at a clip somewhat slower than refrigerated ketchup, but we get to meet and like the girls, even while Tarantino teases us with hints of T & A. Thus, when Stuntman Mike breaks out of his rather bland persona into a leering maniac, we shudder. The last half hour---particularly the chase scene---will keep you hopping.<br /><br />Although its only half of the GRINDHOUSE experience, DEATH PROOF stands on its own merits, particularly if you're a fan of the low-budget films it honors.merits, particularly if you're a fan of the low-budget films it honors.
B000002GBB|5.0|The three mid seventies albumns are by far the best of Styx.  Starting with \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"Grand Illusion\\", and finally this one with the odd time dialated cover.

It has the incredible beats of percussion and drums and the screaching(mid range) voice of James Yong and the elvan sounding Denis De'Yong.  Let's not forget Young's hard mid sounds on gitar and Shaw's masterful leads.  IF you want to be uplifted(or go sailing) this is the music to listen too!

The special features and out takes make this worth the price of admission.  I laughed so hard at Nathan Fillion.  He's hilarious.  I would have loved to have been on the set with him everyday.  If laughter's the best medicine, the cast and crew of Firefly are the healthiest people on the planet.    Still a great movie by the way.  We need a Big Damn Sequel!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Okay...I remember watching this show when it first aired...but in retrospect its importance is  unrivaled..and this presentation is spectacular!  Other than the opening tracks with Dylan which are middling quality on the video side of things...the visuals are typically first rate network quality.  The performances are even a higher level. Some of the musical icons of the century and that is NOT an overstatement... performing  classic repertoire, and doing it well. Whether its a clean shaven Waylon Jennings or glittery Tammy Wynette...long haired (yes he wasn't always bald) James Taylor...you can read the entire roster of guest performers and the list is exhaustive. its a stunning collection of musical hall  of famers!  This is a prime example of finding gold in old film vaults... I  only wish Johnny had survived and could contribute...but his old pal Kris Kristofferson is a great host!

Strangely enough, Death Proof now seems to be a tighter film, even with a longer running time.  The conversations between the girls seem faster, snappier and more involving; less talky. The much-anticipated lap-dance sequence is hot and worth waiting for.    Watching the film again, you better appreciate both groups of girls.  The first group is young, naive, innocent and looking to have fun as young people do, so their fate is heartbreaking.  The second group is more jaded, edgier and definitely tougher.  I like the contrast, and it's easier to see the second time around.     Ignore the negative reviews, and watch Death Proof for what it is: an entertaining revenge flick.
B000VZVT5Y|5.0|If you play guitar this is the one Beatle songbook to own. Every song is really chorded ACCURATELY (with some very small and minor exceptions) from the original recordings. This includes some songs that open with guitar riffs picked out of chords. The text is only lyrics and chord markings (with chord patterns at the top of the page). However, since they follow the recordings you can learn the songs by listening and playing along. I'm surprised somebody did not published such a book twenty years ago. I would have bought it then!!
B00008YLV2|5.0|This edition of Black Hawk Down is well worth the purchase if your a fan. There are plenty of hours of extra features.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|LOVE this CD!  I've listened, almost exclusively, to this CD for over six months and will never tire of it!
B000UX6THK|5.0|I'm a mid-30s guy, work in publishing, and just the other day I was discussing TV shows with two interns who work with me. They are in their early 20s, and so when I mentioned \\"Twin Peaks\\" as my all-time favorite TV show, I got blank stares. OK, they were toddlers then. That's OK. They asked what it was about. And you know, you can explain this show 'til your blue in the face. You can't, really, though. You have to see it. And one really couldn't -- until now. With the pilot, Season and Season 2 all together, now everyone can rejoice in David Lynch's ode to the American Small Town -- all it's glory, beauty, violence, pain, lies, demons (!!) and pie-serving diners. It's weird, sure, far out even. Further out than any TV show then or since. But what I love about Lynch is how REAL his work is. Watch the show, and many of his films, and marvel at the people who populate Lynch's films. They are old, overweight, tired and down-trodden, disabled, wheelchair-bound even. It's more real than any Hollywood product full of young, beautiful, flawless people. Others on this site have gone through the plots, I won't. Embrace Lynch's bizzaro world, sure, but look past it to see how real this world is. It's far closer to reality than most entertainment.
B000TSIK14|5.0|I am one of those who were \\"stung\\" by the Scorpions more than 20 years ago. I instantly loved their melodic hard rock sound and I proudly own their entire 35 year library. I can emphatically say that no Scorpions album has ever \\"WOWED\\" me as this one has. This album, like others have mentioned, is a wondrous mixture of the old Scorpions sound with a more contemporary rock twist. Most of these songs are so catchy and melodic you will find yourself humming them throughout your day. I consider this album a high water mark for their careers and I truly hope there is an Hour II. My take on each song........    Hour I - Just a smash mouth rocking song and the perfect opener to this set. It easily has Matthias' best solo since the Face the Heat album of 1993. I can't wait to hear it live. 9/10    The Game of Life - This song is one of those that just keeps growing and growing on you. It has a very catchy chorus that just makes you sing along. This song is more typical of some of the Scorps sound from the Savage Amusement days. 8/10    We Were Born To Fly - This song is a very powerful and sultry rocker/ballad hybrid. It simply resonates on so many levels and Klaus' voice is fantastic. 9/10    The Future Never Dies - This song is also a rocker/ballad hybrid with a very unique delivery. Like another reviewer mentioned, I also thought of Queen when I first heard this song. It excels in composition and in vocals. 9/10    You're Lovin Me to Death - This song is FUN!!!!! It is a solid rocker with that trademark Scorps melody. The transitions in the song are unique and again you will find yourself singing along. 8/10    321 - Arguably the most contemporary rock song on the album, but ironically probably the most throwback song lyrically. Like Hour I, this song is tuned down and the result is a pulsating rhythm that will simply make you move. Another catchy chorus to enjoy. 8/10    Love Will Keep Us Alive - This is my least favorite song on the album. It simply lacks the lyrical creativity and musical composition of some of the other songs. However, Klaus's voice is so stunning at times in this song that it nearly resurrects it from mediocrity. 6.5/10    We Will Rise Again - Vocally superb!!! This song is another fantastic example of the perfect mixture of Scorpions retro with Scorpions neo. Like most songs on the album the music and lyrics resonate with a depth and maturity that is undeniable. 9/10    Your Last Song - Very moving song about the end of a relationship. This song is well written and more than memorable as another rocker/ballad hybrid. Klaus'vocals again shine on this one, especially at the end. 8/10    Love Is War - This song simply resonates with me on so many levels. It may be my favorite song on the album. This one is more of an acoustic light rocker with another one of those hooks and choruses that make you sing it in your head all day long. The lyrics are emphatic and passionate and again the vocal delivery is superb. 10/10    The Cross - A rocker with a very mature theme about betrayal. This one is an instant Scorps classic and would sound great live!! 9/10    Humanity - There are simply NOT enough superlatives for this masterpiece!!! It has everything you could ask for in a rock song.....strong rock rhythm, beautiful melodic overtones, harmonies that are awe inspiring, and thought provoking lyrics. If this song gets no U.S. airplay it may very well kill the last shred of respect I have for the U.S. radio industry. 10/10    Cold - This song is a bonus track on many imports and on the version you can get at Best Buy. It is a solid melodic rock song with a provocative and mature theme. It should have been on the album anyways, in my opinion, and is definitely worth having if you can pick up a copy that has it. 8/10    This album is simply a masterpiece folks and unless U.S. radio suddenly wakes up,  it's a shame most people will never hear a note of it. Be one of the lucky ones and give this one the many spins it deserves.
B000BCE7QU|5.0|A long time fan of 'When love break down' and 'Appetite' I was surprised to hear a review of the remastered release on NPR. The production is very lush and sounds great. These songs really stand the test of time. Sure I love the 80's bands but Paddy's songs have meaning so many years later. This is a great album, don't think twice about adding it to your music library.
B000068TPN|5.0|One of the best written finest movies I have seen.  The facts were true and honest. The LTC was truly a great leader. One of few.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I have been a life long Pink Floyd fan and a Roger Waters fan and a David Gilmour Fan.  I even like the two releases form Richard wright and that of Nick Mason.  They can not be compared.  I felt like I had to say that.    David Gilmour has been rehearsing.  His voice is much more alive and vital than it was on David Gilnour in Concert.  The song selection here is fantastic and his guitar playing has remained consistent after all these years. He sounds more like himself than he ever did before and he seems truely happy.  The inclusion of Echoes is worth the price of the DVD.  It is done in a much more polished way than the original recording and the climax even surpases the version on Live at Pompei.  David Bowie does a nice job on Comfortably numb and Arnold Lane.  The production and sound on this disc are great.  Camera changes are very fluid.  this is a must have for any Pink Floyd fan (I'm excluding all of you who are negative for the sake of being negative....why are you reading this anyway?).   There is an interesting piece on the second disc where Gilmour and Waters just happen to be working at the same studio.  They meet and are nothing more than cordial with each other.  Not sure what to make of it, but it is interesting.
0743554450|5.0|This was much better than Kite Runner.  The audiobook was very engrossing.  I found myself driving around the block when I got home just to listen a few more minutes.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Without reading any reviews about this movie I immediately decided to type my own.  Excuse me if this is a little redundant to what was previously written.  However I know there are two main arguments most people have about this movie.  My goal in this review is to elaborate with my opinion about these two issues.    The first argument I hear often is that it is a rip off that Grindhouse is being released as seperate DVDs instead of the original format shown in theatres.  I couldn't disagree more.  Personally I believe it's a great move they did this.  Granted I do wish I could have a copy to play these two films back to back with the trailers and missing reels but hey, those who missed out are out of luck.  The whole purpose of showing these two films back to back was to experience what grindhouse movie theatres had to offer.  It doesn't make much sense to have missing reels and advertisements for sloppy mexican food on a DVD.  Not many people have film projecters and stadium seating in their living room.      The second argument I hear often is that a TON of people claim that this movie is bad...really bad.  Their main claim is that there is not enough excitement and too much dialogue.  I don't believe they knew what Quentin was trying to achieve in this film.  Quentin did an outstanding job with this movie.  The dialogue is what you would expect...except this time around it's women doing most of the talking instead of men talking about cunnilingus.  The music really enhances the feel of the every scene.  The stunts in this film are a breath of fresh air in this industry currently flooded with CGI computer animated crap.  The chase scene at the end is one that is truly remarkable and simply classic.  Zoe Bell is AWESOME!!!!  Sit down, grab a beer and enjoy this movie.  It's really not hard to do, even though most people would beg the differ.      Support artists like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.  If you don't the movie theatres will eventually become one big MTV TRL show.
0793542049|5.0|This book breaks down how to develope bass lines to the most essential concepts. Target tones and working from the root and the 5th as a beginning to understanding how to ground yourself harmonically. Execellent for beginner and even those with minimal reading skills. Good Work Mr Friedland, many new or intermediate Bass players (as well as other musicians in general) can benefit from better understanding how a bass line can and should grow out of the progression.
6305897786|5.0|What makes this movie rather unique in this day-and-age is to see a horror- occult movie that has very little action. That may turn off a lot of modern-day viewers and critics but I thought it was refreshing.....as long as the story could still keep one's attention, which it did. It also did it with a pretty long movie: 133 minutes. I have played this movie several times for friends and no one has gotten bored.    The attraction is (1) decent acting; (2) some great sets; (3) an involving story; (4) interesting characters and (5) low profanity.    What keeps most viewers interested is simply wondering what is going to happen next in \\"Dean Corso's\\" (Johnny Depp) quest to figure out the hidden message. Without giving anything away, this is a classy, solid thriller.....and more importantly, fun to watch.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Hadn't seen the movie in, oh, 40 years or so and it took my breath away all over again.  By now I have been to Salzburg and the surrounding countryside and so was able to recognize many of the locations.  I was also able to appreciate more some of the romantic subtleties lost on an 8-year-old (my age when the movie came out.)  To hear Julie Andrews singing at her peak is always divine.  I haven't been able to watch Disk 2 yet b/c I can't get it out of the box, but I'm looking forward to doing that.  Run, don't walk, to get this if you haven't already!!!  It's one of the best movies for all ages of all time, and with the remastering and watching it on a DVD player or laptop with headphones, you'll feel as if you're in the middle of the action.  At least I did.
B00003CXGG|4.0|I was surprised I enjoyed much of this since martial arts movies are okay but nothing I really get into often. Jet Li plays the only likable character in this Asians vs. Blacks gang story.    Some of the stunts were tremendous. Some were so over-the-top, so unbelievable that they were funny. The movie certainly isn't one to be taken seriously.     The wild action scenes, fairly involving story and nice colors and interesting sound track all make this movie a cut above the normal martial arts fare. The excellent surround sound and sharp picture make it a good one for DVD.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|After the masterpiece that was Mullholland Drive, comes Inland Empire, David Lynch's worst film. The first half hour is semi-coherent, as Laura Dern plays an actress living in a very wealthy mansion (and with a very jealous husband) set to star in some film. Her costar is Justin Theroux and the director Jeremy Irons. The feature seems to have been made in the past, but it was reportedly stopped after its main actors were murdered. This is the start, and as the half hour approaches, the films collapses into absurdity, full of unconnected surreal vignettes that test the patience of the audience. For instance, Dern's character suddenly becomes a street hooker (is the actress dreaming she was a hooker or is it the other way around? does anybody cares?). And don't ask about the meaning of the rabbits or polish angle of the film. As a twenty minute short, this material might be OK, but as a three hour feature this is simply unbearable. Even Lynch's previous bizarre feasts (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway) look like a model of lineal clarity as compared to this. Heck, even Dune was a better film than this.
0783225849|5.0|When I watched this in the `90s for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.    I mention the lack of action, and blood, too, because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.    \\"Norman Bates\\" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.    What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later, of course, I got the DVD that is here on this page.  Each time, I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD, the blacks, whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.    I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again.
B000SQJ27I|4.0|If you like the diversity of Manu Chao's music, you will enjoy La Radiolina. His orphans - his description of those musical sounds that pepper his songs - are present throughout the album. My only disappointment is that my favorite orphan, that pito/whistle that is featured prominently in \\"Denia,\\" \\"La Valse à Temps,\\" and others is present only once: In \\"El Kitapena\\" (0:03 and 0:34). The sirens and trumpets are here as is his newest addition to the family: the video game sample.    \\"Tristeza Maleza\\" has a melancholic undertone, particularly when he sings: \\"Y chore, y chore, y chore\\" (and I cried, and I cried, and I cried). It is the concluding line of his haunting song, \\"Siberie,\\" one of his best songs, in my opinion.    \\"Politik Kills\\" features a guitar hook that gives the song its swagger, but the soft melodic trumpet reigns it in. There is no mistaking his political awareness in this song, which in my view makes him an important artist to support.    \\"Me Llaman Calle,\\" a song he wrote for the movie Princesas is a musical departure from the songs that precede it. Caye is a prostitute in the aforementioned movie and appears to be the subject of this song - or at least, its inspiration. She is the woman who is like a little machine walking up and down the city streets awaiting the johns (\\"como makinita por la gran cuidad\\") It is a tender song about her struggles and hopes.    \\"A Cosa\\" features Tonino Carotone (of \\"Me Cago en el Amor\\" fame and whose song I highly recommend). \\"A Cosa\\" incorporates the trumpet melody from \\"Djanfa.\\" I also detect a new orphan here: The two-beat keyboard bit that is played in the latter half of the song. It is featured prominently in \\"Amalucada Vida.\\"    \\"The Bleedin Clown\\" is reminiscent of Iggy Pop's \\"Cry for Love.\\" I would not be surprised if this song influenced its structure. If you enjoy Pop's song, you will more than likely appreciate this one.     \\"Otro Mundo\\" is lyrically reminiscent of Mano Negra's \\"Sueño de Solentiname\\" and features the lyrical orphan: \\"Calavera no llora. No tiene corazón,\\" which he sings in Próxima Estación. It is one of the most peaceful songs on the album.     \\"Amalucada Vida.\\" This song alone is worth the price of the album. You cannot help but swivel your hips to \\"woe woe woe.\\" Its beauty is its simplicity.    Manu Chao's facility with language (there are approximately five different languages on this album) and his creative use of musical orphans continues to amaze me. If you have enjoyed his previous work, you will find something in La Radiolina that will suit your tastes.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Wow, what a strange film. It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird.     I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film several years ago, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character.    At any rate, I find the film fascinating, no matter how many times I watch it. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet.\\" There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it's very well scored.    The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.
0060578793|3.0|I found this book to thoroughly take me through the fundamentals of survival, however, I am always thinking of some very particular situations that I could find myself in that weren't addressed.     For instance, what about the \\"trapped in a cabin by avalance\\" that we're all fearful of? I play it over and over in my head. Most likely it would be 3 or 4 of us on a weekend ski trip. I've always felt that it would be best to go ahead and turn on the others very early on in the event of an avalance instead of waiting for starvation to decimate the group.     For one, each day trapped in that cabin means that everyone will be burning calories, making themselves thinner and thinner, not leaving much of a meal if natural course is left to do the dirty work of finishing them off.  Not to mention, you might be too weak for a death match days later.    Also, turning on them early will almost assuredly be unexpected, since ditching ethical behavior at first opportunity is not the norm and especially with so much food still in the fridge. You're going to need that element of surprise, b/c let's face it, when you start helicoptering that timber axe over your head, the line will clearly be drawn in the sand and its 1 versus 3 at that point. You'll need to mow them all down very quickly. Don't worry that you aren't hungry yet, as there should be plenty of snow at the windows that can be used to keep the bodies from spoiling.     But I definitely liked the informative chapter on which leaves are ok to eat and which are poisonous.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Ok, so this is a 3 hour art film with no sets,or backgrounds, just white lines drawn on the stage floor to represent the houses and the streets of a small town in the Rocky Mountains. Even the dog--a character who helps to open and end the movie is a drawing on the floor. For some of you this may be difficult to adjust to, although I found that after the first few minutes, I was drawn into the movie and was no longer distracted by the lack of objects and visual effects. So hang in, this tale of the darker, greedy side of humanity and capitalism has a strong, stinging message which is thought provoking. The movie tells of a small simple town which is turned into one of greed and cruelty, and the shocking consequence. The main characters, Grace and Tom will raise a variety of emotions, such as sympathy, surprise, shock, and yes, even horror. Nichole Kidman, who plays Grace gives an emotional performace which may be her best to date.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I first watched this movie over a year or so ago at a friends house, and remember getting a headache trying to figure just what the heck was going on in the film!! Now, after re-watching it recently, I found out that this film isn't that hard follow, and above all, it is very good. Like everyone else who has viewed the film, I was shocked by the looks of Christian Bale. Ha, everyone thinks that Tom Hanks did a great job of losing weight for the role he played in \\"Castaway\\", well Bale's weight loss blows that right out of the water! As far as the story, it is very well written, and it keeps you guessing what exactly is going to become of his man who claims he \\"hadn't slept in a year\\"..Yes,that's physically impossible, but the character that Bale plays really believes this (watch the Director's commentary during that scene, and you'll know what I'm talking about)Anyway, I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone that might not have watched it, so all I'm going to say that the movie is about a man that suffers from extreme insomnia  that cause him to have feelings of confusion, paranoia, guilt, and anxiety to the point that he doesn't know what's real and what's not. This film does have a sorta \\"Hitchcock\\" feel to it, combined with something out an old Twilight Zone episode. It's a very dark and slow paced film, and the performance by Christian Bale is riveting. And what many people might not know is that the film was filmed entirely in Barcelona, Spain, and a lot of the exteriors had to be changed to make it look like it was filmed in America. This  DVD has some decent special features. It has a good and informative director's commentary, a 25 minute '\\"making of\\" feature called \\"The Machinist: Breaking the Rules\\", and 8 deleted/alternate scenes (which aren't that different from the original scenes). I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys psychological/thriller/mystery types of films.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|I was very disappointed, especially after all the hype reviews I read before buying it.  I found the sepia not to my liking although I can understand how it was used, for instance, to augment the disgusting make-up of the so call seers Leonides and predecessors were supposed to use before engaging in war. The \\"Hollywood\\" writhing of the beautiful actress was too much considering the atmosphere.   I turned the movie off after that sequence and considered it a waste of money and my time.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|While Diana Krall is not the apex of jazz vocalist when it comes to the instrument of her voice, (that would be Diane Schuur) she makes up for it by oozing sex appeal onto every note. For that... She is unbeatable.<br /><br />This is a great collection for someone like me who really likes Ms. Krall's music but isn't ready to go buy the whole catalogue of her work, as it has the songs I am most familiar with, and thereby my favorites.<br /><br />Great CD!
B000O178BY|4.0|Year Zero is not an instant NIN classic, but I am a NIN fan so I picked it up a couple months after release. Survivalism and Capital G are great songs, but the rest of the album takes some listening to. It is not a complete classic like Pretty Hate Machine or the Downward Spiral.<br />If you are a NIN fan, pick it up and listen to it a couple times. It will grow on you, but it will not grab you immediately. It took a couple listens, but I am digging it now. Pick it up and give it a couple listens, even if it is to only support Trent for his music evangelism.
1594489505|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this as I enjoyed the Kite Runner so much. This was well written but there was no joy at all in the book. It was tragic and then more tragic, then depressing. I did not feel the reader connected with the charecters as much as they could have. The twist really was not, pretty predictable.     You probably will enjoy the prose but I would wait until the paperback.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I have been a Sarah McLachlan for over a decade now beginning with her first album [[ASIN:B000002VGJ Touch]]. I have always loved her gentle vocals and introspective lyrics. I recently got around to hearing her Christmas album [[ASIN:B000HBKCDC Wintersong]]. While I do like the cd a lot, I have to admit I had to listen to it a few times to get used to Sarah's take on songs like \\"What Child is This?\\" and \\"The First Noel/Mary Mary\\". Initially I wasn't really wild about the melodies to those songs but after several listens, I grew to love them. My favorite track has to be Sarah's haunting cover of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\\". I always loved the music and the lyrics. Sarah's gentle vocals compliments the song very well. I also enjoyed the new tracks \\"River\\" and \\"Wintersong\\". Even though WINTERSONG is a Christmas album, I do like listening to it after work. I find the music very soothing to listen to. This album is a must have for Sarah fans I think.
B000QFCD2W|5.0|I'm not surprise about Kind Diamond, it has been always one of the best heavy metal band, but this album is a MASTERPIECE.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|One day before I embark to go see Canada's incredible Arcade Fire in concert, I ask myself: Why rate this album lower than Five Stars? What you get with their sophomore effort is not a sophomore slump at all. You get music that somehow, someway, speaks to you when you close your eyes late at night, when you awaken early in the morning, when you're off doing your own thing in this vast world. A world in which most music nowadays, especially rock music, is full of the same boring stuff that gets recycled over and over. I've read a couple of one to three star reviews here and I will have to disagree with all of them. Yeah, yeah, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but when you're not open minded and can care less about genuine, solid music, you will just not understand a band like the Arcade Fire. This is a different kind of band, a band that will open your mind to music that is rare in these modern times. So close your eyes and be ready to be transported elsewhere and have your breath taken away.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Like many others, I'd much rather have \\"Grindhouse\\" than seperate releases. When that film is released, I'm first in line to buy it.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|It's about time this Diva of the jazz piano put together a nice greatest hits package, from start to finish, this cd showcases the talent that she is, was, and will be for years to come.<br /><br />that voice is in pure form, smokey jazz from a smoldering hot Lady...this cd would make a great introduction to her music and style for those that have never heard....Brava to you Diana, can't wait to see you in concert this year!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Note: Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br />I've watched this movie many times. It really requires concentration, and I think it has to be watched several times. I don't like long reviews for movies I haven't seen, so I'll be brief for those who haven't seen \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"<br /><br />The movie begins with a young women is sitting in the backseat of a fancy car at night. The car pulls over, and just as one of the men in the front seat is about to shoot her, a carload of teenagers crashes into them, killing them all except for the young women. The woman wanders down the hill to Mulholland Drive, sleeps outside behind some shrubs, then sneaks into a condo, where she is found by the new resident (another young woman--actually the same woman).<br /><br />Like I say, you just have to watch the movie several times to catch everything. It's very strange with some fantastic scenes.<br /><br />The cowboy scene is worth the whole movie. It's really funny, but done in a deadly serious manner. Super!
B000TUXL2A|4.0|Don't judge this record on the first listening.  You have to savor it and let it fully steep. This album continues my pattern of experience for each new Knopfler record.  Upon the first listening, I think, \\"I waited for this?\\"  After a few repeated plays, I think \\"Hey, cool narratives.\\"  After about ten plays (yes, this has been spinning in my home and car CD players at least that many times) I think, \\"Knopfler is the best story teller in the business!\\"<br /><br />There are many people churning out songs that are fully digested in one play through.  Knopfler's song-craft is more like a great wine.  It does not knock you over the head, but you know it stands out in subtle ways.  It also has substance, so it will be valid for years to come.<br /><br />There is some derivative music here, similar tone and tempo from previous Knopfler work... see if you can spot the clone of \\"Stand up guy\\" from Shangri-La.  There is a dearth of guitar gymnastics, and indeed there is a simplification of sorts, relegating the guitar the second fiddle (pun intended) to the voice.  None of this is bad, but a nice extended solo or a single up tempo track would have been welcome.<br /><br />That said, this is the most \\"grown up\\" disc that I have bought this year, and one that will go into frequent rotation for my listening pleasure.

B000FTWB7G|3.0|When I reviewed Evanescence's first album Fallen, I ended the review by saying something like, \\"They won't be falling any time soon.\\" But then co-founder Ben Moody left the band almost immediately afterwards (a result of his and Amy Lee's lovers-turned-friends relationship having gone wrong, perhaps?). Then, the lineup of the rest of the band was shaking up so much that it would give Queens of the Stone Age a run for their money. With that, I was wondering if maybe this album should have been called The Revolving Door rather than The Open Door.<br /><br />All in all, though, this is really Amy's band; she's the only vocalist, and she's the only member on the cover of each of the band's albums. But this album still has quality material, especially the lead single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\". Other notables include \\"All That I'm Living For\\", \\"Cloud Nine\\" and the necessary end-of-album acoustic song, \\"Good Enough\\" (well, acoustic PIANO, anyway).<br /><br />But it's not all fun and games: \\"Like You\\" is a bittersweet dedication Amy made to her younger sister, who died at an early age from a rare disease. Speaking of not all fun and games, despite the exceptional quality of the songs on the first half of the album, if you listen to the lyrics you'll discover that they're all about heartbreak, thus resulting in a lack of variety. This is why I knocked my rating down from four to three-and-a-half stars.<br /><br />But The Open Door isn't a bad album by any means. I wonder how long it'll take for Evanescence to make a third studio album; maybe Amy should just go solo (there was actually talk about her releasing a solo album around 2004, but apparently that idea got shelved). But this recording is still worth picking up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B000NA2BEU|2.0|I loved the first season of Veronica Mars. The second season was good despite it's faults. The third left me with a giant mental question mark.  Part of the problem was that the show switched networks and had to accomidate a new audience that would be coming in with little to no knowledge of what happened previously on the show. To deal with that, the writers decided to abandon the season long mystery arcs that the show had used earlier (Lily Kane's murder in Season 1 and the bus crash in Season 2) in favor of 2 \\"mini arcs\\" several episodes each and final five stand alone episodes. While I see the reasoning behind the decision to do this the show suffered from a lack of cohesiveness. But that was a minor problem for this season.    When we first met Veronica she was a high school junior whose world had been turned upside down. Her best friend had been brutally murdered, her boyfriend had dumped her without explanation, her father had lost his job and become a local outcast and her mother had left town. To top it all off she'd been drugged and raped at a party. We see her in that first season, intelligent and determined to put her life back together. And we cheer for her as she does it- she doesn't recreate the life she once had but she creates something new. Fast foreward a few years to the third season. Veronica is begining college at the prestigious Heast College, with her high school friends by her side, including her boyfriend, Logan Echolls. She's still beautiful, still smart and sarcastic, but the good heart and plucky determinism is wearing a bit thin. Her first case: catch the rapist who has been drugging coed's, raping them, and shaving their heads. For Veronica this case should hit close to home. Perhaps a bit too close to home. But it doesn't. She approaches it as just another case, forgetting that she's a survivor of the same crime, and only bringing it up to the victims when it can be used to her advantage. It makes her seem a little cold. A little lesssympathetic. Almost each case Veronica takes on this season involves sex in some way: the hooker with the heart of gold trying to escape her pimp, the faux sex tape making it's way around campus, and much of the time it's exploitive. None of which seems to phase Veronica. Her personal connection to these crimes is quite simply ignored by the writers. That's a huge fault in my book.     The characters have also lost some bite. Logan Echolls, Veronica's soul mate and sometimes nemesis has always had a sarcastic wit to match Veronica's. He's been able to think on his feet and joke his way into and out of sticky situations. That's what makes his scenes with Veronica a treat: Watching their chemisty as they butt heads and occasionally meet in the middle. But when this season begins Logan has lost his sense of humor. He broods, he cuddles with Veronica but there's nary a snarky comment. Veronica and her father once had one of the best father/daughter dynamics on television. They were pals, coworkers, and family. They'd joke with each other but there was always a genuine affection underlying each exchange. But in this season their banter crossed the line from friendly to disturbingly sexual. It was almost as if the writers forgot that they're father and daughter. Meanwhile several new characters are introduced to little or no purpose.     Continuity, never the shows strong point, is pretty much discarded this season. Veronica's best friend, Wallece, disappears for a large portion of this season but his absense is never explained or even acknowledged. He shows up again with no explanation as to where he was and no one bats an eyelash. Such gaps are par for the course here.       We do have some good moments in this season: we have several surprising revelations, a few tense moments, and some witty scenereos. The episode where Veronica uncovers the identity of the Hearst rapist is a winner for example. That's why I'm giving this season two stars. But  when I compare it to what once was it's clear that this show really jumped the shark in it's third and final season.

0553381695|4.0|A Clash of Kings is the second in the ongoing \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, sequel to A Game of Thrones, and the series continues to be entertaining and interesting, one of my favorite ongoing fantasy series.  What makes it different from other fantasy series is that Martin, instead of using chapter numbers and having everything be specifically chronological, has about five to ten characters whose heads you are in.  So you can be immediately whisked away to another battle, another land, another family feud by the turn of the page.  Plus Martin isn't afraid of killing of characters, which can be horrible if one gets really attached to certain characters, but I find it admirable that he has the bravely to do this.  I think it isn't done enough in fiction, specifically fantasy.  Sure the good guys need to win, but not all the time!    Near the end of A Clash of Kings there was a huge battle between two big armies: one attacking the other on a river, so starting as a naval battle, and then once the men landed on the ground moving on to trying to break into the fortress.  Your regular historical or fantasy novel would have you in the head of your main character who would likely be one of the leaders of the armies.  The P.O.V. might switch during the battle to the other leader's viewpoint on the other side and then come back to your main character.  With Martin's literary device, the reader sees the battle unfolding from three interesting viewpoints: from the leader of the army in the fortress (who is an ugly dwarf); from one of the captains of the ships on the other side attacking the fortress, as he leads in the ship and engages the enemy (he ends up getting killed); and from a young girl who is a hostage in the fortress, under the watchful eye of the queen, in a room full of the important women who are just waiting around to find out if they are on the winning side, or if they are on the losing side and the enemy is about to break down the door and the knight will beordered to kill them all so they won't end up as hostages.  So instead of seeing the entire battle from one of possibly two P.O.V.s, the reader gets three totally different viewpoints, and it just helps to heighten the tension and suspense.    Next in the series is A Storm of Swords, with A Feast For Crows due out November 8th.  As Martin was writing A Feast For Crows, passing the thousand-page mark a couple of months before the book was done, he was told by his publisher that they can't have one book be this long.  He'd previously promised that his next book would not be as long as A Storm of Swords, which was 1216 pages in the mass market edition.  Since he's going to long pass this, he negotiated with Random House to split the book in two.  What he's decided to do, and as I get further into the series I can't understand how he's going to do this, is have half of the characters in one book, and the other half in the next book.  Some of the characters can be on their own tangents, meeting different people, and not actually have anything to do with the other main character's whose heads the reader is in, but there are other main characters who interact with each other quite often, and I just don't know how Martin is going to reconcile this.    It's going to be interesting, that's for sure.  And the good thing Martin said is that the new book comes out soon, and the next one is already half done.

B000RG1FMO|3.0|First off let me say that I'm a HUGE Kanye West fan! Being from Chicago yet away from home, in the Air Force, Kanye's music has been the pictures from home I need when I'm away! Now after all of that I have 2 say I'm really disapointed in what I heard when I opened up that creative little package the CD comes in! After Late Registration came out a lot of mainstream media publications complained that the skits were unfunny and annoying. It seems that with Graduation Kanye did something I wouldn't expect him to do, he caved in to critics! There are NO skits on Graduation. What he didn't realize was those \\"annoying\\" skits upheld the theme of the album. I was SO LET DOWN when I started 2 play my Graduation CD for the first time and did not hear Chicago comedian Dee-Ray's Bernie mac impression either bashing Kanye for his poor performance doing his school years or congratulating him for graduating. From that point on there is NO CONNECTION to the first two albums as the title suggest and for a huge fan of those CDs like myself that was something that was hard to get past. Kanye seems to spend a lot of the album answering to critics about past statements he made or past outfits he's worn! Where's the guy who doesn't give a damn what ANYONE thinks and goes with what he feels??? I support that guy! All and all the songs on this CD are very good and MUCH better than anything that's out now! You have to admire someone who's made it without constantly harping on guns, drugs, the club and stealing someone's girl. But I bought into the hype and RAN out and bought the CD as soon as possible so Kanye's 1st week sells would beat 50's \\"and they DID! YES, HIP HOP IS NOT DEAD!\\" and I argued with friends who thought about downloading this CD. But in the end as good as this music is and it IS A REALLY GOOD CD, it was not what I was waiting for and I was left hoping for more.
0307346609|5.0|I've read two books about zombies this year: one I found fascinating, incredibly interesting, and decreed it the best book of the year!; the other was formulaic, predictable, kind of failed in its goal, and ended terrible - one of them was written by Stephen King, can you guess which one?  Being an avid King reader (yes, I've read it all!), you would expect the King zombie book to be the former, but alas.  Cell was abysmal, World War Z is the best book I've read in a long time.    The key to World War Z is in its execution not as a horror book - even though it's about humanity's struggling war against zombies, and even though it's most likely categorized as horror in every bookstore - but as a piece of thrilling and thought-provoking and contemplative fiction.  Brooks' genius with this book is in using a quasi-journal format where the narrator is traveling around the world interviewing a variety of different people from different backgrounds and cultures on how they managed to survive the war with the zombies.  The book is set about a decade after World War Z, giving the reader the reassurance that we survived, and this book is about how.    Brooks' first book, The Zombie Survival Guide, gave step by step preparedness for what to do when confronted by one or a host of zombies: it's a humor book meant to make you laugh and snicker at this outlandish situation.  World War Z is not a funny book, but a deadly serious one.  It's quite shocking to contemplate the extensive research Brooks must have done to find out crucial details not just about the thirty different countries the narrator visits, but to also find out specific slang and expressions to that country and culture, and to know how a member of the military would act as opposed to a ordinary person, or another specifically skilled member of society in that country.  He must have gained a wealth of knowledge about the different societies of the world in general.    Brooks then takes it one step further in coming out with different operations and game plans for the different countries: what the government did, what the military did, and what its citizens did, all pertaining to the current regime of the time.  The book is set not more than twenty years from the present time, so we are all familiar with the regimes and different governments of this world: from Bush's conservative, military heavy America; to a clandestine and mysterious North Korea; to a potent and still racist South Africa.    World War Z is a book about zombies that changes the way you think about the world and its people.  It makes you think about how we're all in this together, we're all the same - regardless of the world-threatening devastation, be it zombies, terrorism, or a pandemic virus.  World War Z serves as a guide book to humanity, so that when the \\"big thing\\" - whatever it is - happens, we'll be a little more caring of other people around the world, regardless of what god they believe in, or the color of their skin.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I did not get to see grindhouse in theaters, due to the fact that my job takes me away from the world more often than not.  So I bought death proof looking forward to another GREAT Tarantino movie.  (since in my opinion everything this man touches is gold!)  Low and behold, THIS FILM WAS HORRID!!!  The only thing good was the first crash and the fact that I could fast forward through the hours of truly mindless banter of this thing they want to pass off as a movie.  Save yourself money, and wait 30 years untill this comes out somewhere for 50 cents........though it may still not be worth it!
0439813786|5.0|Brian Selznick, who previously has done a mixture of writing and illustration, brings us his greatest creation to date: The Invention of Hugo Cabret.  The main character, Hugo, is a young orphan who used to live with his uncle behind the scenes of a Paris train station.  Then his uncle died, and Hugo now spends his time, in the late 1930s, winding up and oiling, fixing and maintaining the many clocks and devices around the train station, all alone.  He is rarely seen and actually lives behind the walls, while thousands of people, day to day, travel to make their trains, or disembark for other destinations.    It is on one day that he gets to know the man who owns the newsagents in the train station, after befriending his daughter.  The story slowly unfolds that the man is actually George Méliès, one of the most important people in the early days of film, his most famous piece being about four men who traveled to the moon known as A Trip to The Moon, with the memorable image of the dough-like moon with a face grimacing as the bullet-like ship is shot into its eye.  Méliès died in 1938, but it is in this story that he lives on working in obscurity at the newsagents.  The story unravels further to reveal an inextricable link between Méliès and Hugo.    While this would be an enjoyable story in its own right, Selznick has created a new medium using not just words, or pictures, or illustrations, but incorporating all three into a chronological miasma.  The book begins like a movie, with fifty pages of gray illustration as we zoom in on the train station, into the clock and Hugo Cabret.  Then there is the start of the story in word form, but instantly switching to illustration again, and then cutting to photographs where necessary.  The difference here is that the illustrations are not revealing the written word, but continuing the story of the word.  You cannot skip one, or you miss the story.  The Invention of Hugo Cabret uses all these forms to make this not justa book, but a collection of illustrations, and a type of movie or flicker-book that are all interwoven to tell the story of Hugo Cabret and his relationship with George Méliès, one of the original geniuses in the early days of film.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Just really excellent, and what a good buy I got on it.  The entire family is sharing it.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.
1401211909|5.0|The fairy tales we grow up listening to and learning from our parents and family are usually old, centuries old, sometimes ancient; all with one thing in common: they have elements of truth in them taken from history.  Every once in a while, a story will come along that seems like it is a great fairy tale like that of Hansel and Gretel; a story that has come down from history with those elements of truth, even though it has been imagined and created by a single writer and artist not too long ago.  Stardust is one of those stories: a story that feels like a fairy tale to be told and taught to children of all ages, everywhere, for generations to come.<br /><br />Set in the time of Queen Victoria and when Charles Dickens was serializing Oliver Twist, there is a small and quaint town called Wall.  It is named so for it sits on the very boundary between our world and the world of Faerie.  Naturally, there is a strong stone wall stretching across the edge of town, along this crucial boundary.  There is one opening in the wall that is constantly under guard; the guard's duty is to let no one pass from the village of Wall through this hole and across the boundary into Faerie.  Except that Dunstan Thorn, a sometime guard of the wall, wishes to see this magical world and one day sneaks through the wall and into another world.  He finds a market, an event that only happens every seven years at this location.  There he finds a beautiful woman who has been made a slave to a witch.  She gives him a gift for a single kiss.<br /><br />Returning to Wall, he knows he cannot stay away from the girl who will not leave his mind, and returns that night to her.  They make love under the stars and then Dustan leaves the realm of Faerie and continues his ordinary life in Wall.  Nine months later, a delivery is left on his doorstep.  It is a newborn baby in a basket, along with an envelope with the name TRISTRAN THORN on it.  This is Dunstan's child, and the message in the envelope for Tristran, his son, when he is old enough.<br /><br />Years pass and Tristran grows into a young man living an ordinary life in Wall.  There is a young girl, Victoria Forrester, who has stolen his heart with her beauty and charm.  They have known each other since they were children, but Tristran has been unable to confess his love for her.  Then one night, under the stars, as they picnic together, they see a bright falling star plunge into the deep lands of Faerie.  Tristran promises then to go out and bring back that fallen star for Victoria, as a token of his love.  Victoria allows him, thinking it a joke, and says if he is not back in seven days she will marry the man who has asked for her hand.<br /><br />So begins Tristran's adventure into the land of Faerie in search of the fallen star.  Little does he know the fallen star is now a young girl who was knocked from the night sky by a jewel, an heirloom belonging to the King to Stormhold.  The King lies on his deathbed with three of his seven remaining sons by his bedside.  Whoever returns with the jewel will become king of Stormhold.  There are also three ancient witches who saw the star fall and seek it.  If they return with the human form of the star, they can sacrifice her and regain their magical powers, their youth and beauty.  And so Tristran must make this long journey, against all these odds; along the way he will meet many strange people - some friends, some enemies, some willing to do anything to get the star.<br /><br />Stardust is a magical story that seems to possess elements of every fairytale ever told.  With the relative success of the movie that did not do the original story justice, this new and beautiful hardcover edition is an ideal addition for any Gaiman and/or Vess fan.  But it is also the perfect gift for those family members wishing to tell this story to their children.  Along with the wonderful layout and incredible illustrations full of color and life, this edition has unique illustrations by Vess never before seen in the development of Stardust, along with the original proposal by Gaiman and Vess with the cover art and further illustrations.<br /><br />Stardust is a story you will want to have on your shelf for the rest of your life, to read it yourself on cold rainy nights, or to read it to you children and your children's children.  It is a story to be told many times over and learned by many.<br /><br />For more book reviews, and other writings, go to [...]ent of Stardust, along with the original proposal by Gaiman and Vess with the cover art and further illustrations.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|This is possibly my single favorite film \\"of all time\\".  Kubrick manages to pull off the seemingly impossible and deranged task of a narrated period film in which 1) every important plot point is given away in advance, and 2) there is no message except something like \\"this is life and in the end it doesn't matter what it really is, does it?\\"  It's just about the sickest, loopiest, best idea ever.  To top it off, the narration is a bit stuffy and droll (not to mention completely literally-minded), and our hero is actually an anti-hero.  But in the end, it's as if everything seemingly negative and vacuous is flipped about and we are able to see it all in one sublime and interconnected moment.  That's a good word for this film: sublime... but perhaps \\"strangely sublime\\" would be better.  It's not \\"overwhelmingly sublime\\".  It's not too profound.  It knows that \\"too profound\\" is not profound enough.  Art that's \\"too profound\\" just makes you feel all tingly and inspired, or perhaps \\"awed\\" or \\"frightened\\" at best... but this is different.  To be really \\"sublime\\" you've got to say \\"screw it\\" to the world and all expectations and drive forward with a kind of blind, relentless madness.  It's even madder than it seems because whatever it is you want to be inspire or awed by just isn't there.  This is Barry Lyndon: the relentlessness of looking and looking, seeing everything, but seeing nothing.  Kubrick says \\"I know everything... I am God... and the joke's on you.\\"      There is an undeniable element of fatalism and determinism here: a kind of Spinozistic single-mindedness that transcends all particulars into a united vision that is simultaneously bad and good, ordinary and lofty, meaningless but somehow still something you can't take your eyes away from.  There are so many things going on, so many connections and events and times and places... but somehow they're all the same too.
1897299214|3.0|This is another book -- recommended to me -- in a growing genre of what I guess can be called \\"illustrated journalism\\" or \\"illustrated memoirs\\": writers telling their stories of real life through the medium of graphic novels. Of course, another big author in this genre is Marjane Satrapi, with her greatest achievement being Persepolis, and her story of living in Iran when the Shah was overthrown and the country went through some devastating times. She followed this with Persepolis 2 -- which I have yet to read -- a sequel of her going back to Iran, and most recently Embroideries, which I did read and while I found it interesting -- a group of women meet for tea to discuss their lives as Iranian women and it seems much like one of the salons on the 1920's, where they discuss in secrecy things that shouldn't be talked about -- though I felt the book too short and didn't go into enough depth.    Nevertheless, Satrapi and Delisle are two of this growing genre and with the way graphic novels and comic books are continuing to increase every year in sales and support, I'm really happy that this nonfiction style is also continuing to grow because, much as you can say a lot with words and you can say a lot with pictures, uniting the true presents a whole new insight: not only do you hear the author through his or her words, but you see the emotion in the illustration and an empathic bond inevitably develops.    The author and artist of Pyongyang, Guy Delisle, works in animation and spends some time in North Korea where a part of animation has now been outsourced and there he works with a company, but the story isn't about the animated movie he is working on, it is much more about his experience in living in this relatively unknown country. One cannot help but get the feel of entering a new and undiscovered country for the first time.    North Korea caters, naturally, to its visitors and especially its tourists, so we see a world where there are buildings, towns and structures everywhere, and yet most are run down and have no power. Yet, when the tourists arrive, all of a sudden an entire floor of the hotel is filled with light and life, as well as two of the restaurants on another floor. While the menus aren't exactly five-star, they nevertheless have fresh goods and Delisle enjoys it, but after some weeks the quality goes down until the next group of tourists arrive, whereupon fresh melon is served once again! His most memorable description is of ordering French toast and being served with a slice of white bread on which has been sprinkled milk and warmed in the microwave.    But one really sees in this book the scary world that North Koreans are subjected to under the rule of their president Kim Jong-Il, and while this is a communist regime, one can't help but see stark similarities with just about every ruler, president, and emperor in the history of civilization. For example, the North Korean government goes to extremes to portray Kim Jong-Il and his deceased father and predecessor Kim Il-Sung as almost looking identical and perfectly alive and healthy. All supporters of the government wear pins of one or the other, or a pin of the two, as well as showing constant voluntary support of their government in building shrines to one, the other, or both, and making paintings and erecting statues, and improving their country by painting a bridge or cleaning a street -- it can be seen everyone, as Delisle travels around the country. The northeast part is off limits, government controlled and where, according to the rumors, are all the camps containing the prisoners and rebels. And each supporter constantly proclaims his blind faith to his president; on the radio are about three stations where songs are repetitively played that cry out the greatness of the government and the president, and the listeners are fully expected to sing along.    Tourists are not allowed to travel alone around North Korean and must be accompanied by an interpreter and staunch government supporter all the time (unless they are with the UN), who's job it is to respect the tourists beliefs and yet to convert and enlighten him or her to the ways of their great president and supreme government. One of the most entertaining chapters of the book is when Delisle visits the great museum made for Kim Jon-Il, where everything within extols his greatest and reveals apocryphal facts about his life, such as his penning over 15,000 works before the age of twenty, and how many leaders around the world support his ideal and think him great. What's funny is that Delisle, viewing these artifacts and gifts, is quick to point out how they are either inaccurate or not actually real. And yet the supporters believe without question and while they may listen to other ideas, never shirk their duty to constantly say good things about Mr. Jong-Il.    The book does fail somewhat in going into depth with this world, and it seems once the astonishment of this unknown land passes, Delisle tends to focus a little to much on his day to day machinations and trying to work with the North Korean people, which while interesting at first, tend to get repetitive when there is so much more to explore and see.    Near the end of the book, he focuses on how he makes paper airplanes out of scrap paper and throws them from his hotel window, hoping they will make it to the river and be free, which is the last image of the story, while a hulk of a building grows on the other side of the river where a movie theatre will be built, and even though Delisle has explained this is what this is, the reader knows it's not going to be used for Hollywood blockbusters, and had Delisle researched and investigated more, we would've been given further details of this mysterious country.    I will, however, add that since reading this, playing a new Xbox game called Mercenaries, where the point of the game is to make deals with all the different factions in the demilitarized zone of North Korea and capture all the wanted military of North Korea, it has at least opened my eyes and awareness of this oppressed and dark country.    It will be an interesting day, when the communist government either collapses, or is more likely overthrown, and the stories, experiences and information start pouring out about what life was like in North Korea during this time.

0143036556|5.0|Jared Diamond, renowned author of the Pulitzer-winning Gun, Germs, and Steel, returns with another piece of mind-blowing work that will simply astonish any reader.  In his last book, Diamond took us on a journey into the history of humanity, with cogent and logical answers for why our ancestors did the things they did, tying it in with geological and biological processes; how location matters very much for why certain of our ancestors did much better than others.  Guns, Germs, and Steel serves as an excellent introduction to Collapse, though it is not required.    In his new book, Diamond tackles the overarching reason for why certain cities and civilizations decline and collapse, while others get through the hard times enough to get by and sometimes even thrive.  What are amazing are the many case studies Diamond uses, ranging from early history with the Anasazi, Vikings, and civilization of Eastern Island; to the modern day cultures of Rwanda, Australia and the area of Montana where Diamond now lives for part of the year.  In his introduction, Diamond clearly lays out his plan with the book - much like a scientist about to run a number of experiments - with a specific list of factors that determine a society's success or downfall, including: geographical location, amount of natural resources, amount of possible food, amount of trees.  Some societies suffer from a lacking in just one of these factors and are still unable to survive, while others suffer from a lacking in a number of them.  What's fascinating with these thoroughly researched and explained case studies is how two societies in close proximity to each other will have different outcomes: one may collapse, or barely survive, while the other thrives for many hundreds of years.    Diamond's reason for writing this book, he explains in the beginning and elaborates at the end, is to help the people of the present day realize the predicament we are in.  With global warming, astronomically high carbon dioxide levels, overpopulation, and dwindling supply of nonrenewable energy resources; Diamond seeks to enlighten us in first world countries (those most likely to be reading this book) of collapses and failures of past civilizations - some in the distant past, some in the not too distant, some still ongoing today - as an educational lesson so that we may learn where others failed and why, perhaps then we can ensure our continued survival.  With the factors mentioned above, like overpopulation and dwindling energy supplies, we are right on course with some other past civilizations that collapsed.  The question is whether the governments of the world will realize this and react soon enough to halt us on this doomed path, and start us on a new and healthier one.  Like many things in our lives: only time will tell.    For more book reviews, and other writings, go to [...]
0060254920|5.0|Read as a child myself, who does not have this book?? If you don't-- get one! My children love it, I love it, even my husband loves it! It's fun, fun, fun! And kids LOVE to act it out quoting verbatim after reading for the 123rd time! Must have for the family library! (hang onto it even after they've grown, let them have it to read to their kids!)
0393317552|5.0|This is one of those books that takes you a while to read -- it's pretty heavy non-fiction -- and yet at the end of it, you feel like Hippocrates, a Muslim scientist, or Leonardo Da Vinci must have felt at the realization of a great discovery. The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.    The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.    With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: \\"Oh, that's how that happened,\\" or \\"that's why it's like that.\\" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.    Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:    Thereason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.    Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:    The Aboriginal people spent many thousands of years keeping to their simple ways due to the harsh conditions of Australia. When the Europeans arrived they were able to educate the Aborigines and share their technology and make it seem like these advanced whites were helping and \\"bettering\\" the Aboriginal people, and therefore making them civilized. And yet it was necessary for the Europeans to bring all their technology, culture and science with them for them to survive, otherwise they wouldn't have lasted a week in Australia. It had nothing to do with the Caucasian as a race, but everything to do with the specific parameters for living in Europe and developing the technology and culture under those conditions. This is made clear when Diamond talks about two European explorers from different background who set out, with all their technology and science, to cross the vast landmass of Australia. Neither of them made it to the other side; they both died under the severe conditions. However, the Aboriginal people frequently cross this landmass on their nomadic journeys and make it relatively unharmed.    Overall, what I get from this book is: Why are we all fighting and killing and hating one another? After all the seemingly random events over the last two million years that led from the ape-like hominid to the homo sapiens sapiens of today, it seems all we should be doing is hugging each other and patting everyone on the back for getting through the whole mess and still being alive to tell about it. A lot of animals and dinosaurs aren't.    But don't take my word for it: read and absorb the ideas of Jared Diamond and have your life and your ideas changed for the better.

0671449028|5.0|This book is utterly delightful! I bought it 3 years ago for my youngest son and it was hands down his favorite book. We read it so much that we still recite it by heart. Sandra Boynton has a way of writing books that not only delight the child, but it's infectious! (My little 1 year old daughter who is fascinated by belly buttons- also adores The Belly Button Book by the same author.) The Going To Bed Book is an absolute must for snuggly, silly bedtime routines (that actually are looked forward to!) with your little ones. It sits right next to another old favorite of ours...Goodnight Moon. =0)

B0000CDLA7|4.0|I have the privilege of writing the 800th review for Dream Theater's Train of Thought cd.  That is really quite a lot of reviews.  As a comparison, that's even more reviews than Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\", an absolute legendary cross-over piece of jazz music from the `60's, that has been on every \\"definitive\\" music list ever compiled on the subject.  It's the kind of album people describe as \\"changing their lives\\".  Train of Thought (TOT), in fact, has twice as many reviews, on average, as Dream Theater's (DT) other top releases to include Metropolis part 2 at 668 reviews.<br /><br />Now the strange part.  Out of those reviews there are 152 one-star ratings.  One Hundred and Fifty-Two!  Many popular music releases are lucky to have over a hundred total reviews.  Unbelievable.  What is up with all the hostility towards this release?<br /><br />First of all, a little background on my exposure to DT.  I've only known about the band for a few years.  I missed their debut in the early `90's, as I was busy listening to more \\"mainstream\\" music and older Classic Rock ( I also moved out-of-state, changed jobs, and got married within a year).<br /><br />Anyway, like a lot of people, Images & Words was my first exposure to DT, but instead of moving chronologically through their releases, I jumped to Train of Thought next, and then picked up Octavarium when it was new.  Man, I could not have picked three more varied musical releases by the same band if I was trying to!  The first times I listened to TOT I didn't think \\"Man this is Different\\" because I was not so \\"locked-in\\" and un-bending about the type of music DT played as their older fans seem to be.  I had not listened to I&W a thousand times and then moved on to Awake and spun that endlessly to create the strict Metal / Prog mindset.<br /><br />I once casually said to a DT fan that I thought TOT (after my first initial listen) was similar to I&W.  He exclaimed \\"You must be Crazy.\\"  But, I only meant that TOT was similar enough musically that I could at least tell it was the same band playing the music, that's all.  On closer listening, I now realize just how different the two albums are.<br /><br />After being disappointed in Octavarium, I began looking closer at some of the reviews written here on Amazon to make my next buying decisions.  I've come to the conclusion that I like \\"early\\" DT and not the \\"later\\" stuff.  Kind of the same way I like classic `70's Rush right up to Moving Pictures, and NOT the `80's stuff with all the keyboards.<br /><br />After reading many of the reviews of TOT, one statement seems to get repeated a lot: \\"This isn't Images & Words\\" or \\"I'll Stick with I&W.\\" Come on people, this is 2007!  I&W came out 15 years ago.  That's the same as wishing Rush would make another Moving Pictures type album.  It's Not gonna happen.  They've been there, done that.<br /><br />Now I realize that the main gripe of the DT fans is that the quality of TOT is somehow \\"beneath\\" their beloved DT.  Many have commented on the album being recorded in just 3 weeks.  Well, maybe it was a little rushed, but did you ever think that maybe the band was tired of the prospect of working on another album for months and months and just wanted to have fun for a change?  Other music artists have put together albums even quicker and had plenty of success.  Rush wrote/recorded/mixed \\"2112\\" in only three weeks.  TOT is definitely \\"Heavy\\" and I personally like that.<br /><br />What's interesting to me is the amount of music reviews seems to reflect the fans discontent for a typical musical offering, instead of it's popularity.  For example: Metallica.  The black album was hugely popular, and reached more music fans than any other previous Metallica album had before.  And this is reflected by the One Thousand One Hundred Eighty-eight (1,188) reviews with a 4-star average.  But, the highly controversial St. Anger cd has almost 4 times the amount of reviews!  4,103 at last count.  With a majority being 1-star reviews.  St. Anger is almost universally hated.  In fact, when you look up the cd on Amazon, out of the first \\"most helpful\\" reviews that show up on the opening page, more than half are 1-star ratings!<br /><br />And I agree, I listened to it once and put it away, and have no interest in any more Metallica music than I already own.  One TOT reviewer, \\"The Screaming Yak Ninja\\" from Feb 26, 2004, had the same reaction with TOT.  He claimed to be a (former) \\"life-long\\" fan, and was really into them a lot.  TOT put the death-nail in his coffin!  Hated the music so bad he \\"ripped up the cover and took a knife to the cd before throwing it away\\".  Incredibly Harsh Dude!<br /><br />Most of the bad reviews start coming in 2004 and 2005 with a few early in 2003.  It's interesting to note that there have been No bad (1 or 2 star) reviews in 2006 or 2007.  I guess Time really does \\"Heal all Wounds\\".<br /><br />But, what seems to be a common thread here is fans that have the most trouble with TOT have built up a pre-conceived musical \\"box\\" that DT fits neatly into as either PROGressive-Metal, Metal only, or a predominantly Progressive band.  Especially if they think of DT as only Progressive.  If a fan of DT thinks they are mostly a Metal band, then they seem to be happier with the whole \\"Heavy-Metal\\" theme of TOT.<br /><br />I, for one, am planning on buying Metropolis part 2 next, based on reviews that I have read and the over-all rating of 4 ½ stars.  I might even check out some Liquid Tension Experiment too, a side-project of two of DT's band members.<br /><br />\\"Dr. D's\\" review, ranked as the most helpful (147 of 246) has the best summary I've read:<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />If you like the old Dream Theater just fine, thank you, and do not wish to experiment on a newer and slightly heavier DT - PASS<br /><br />If you are not as rigid but think you may like the old DT better - IT'S YOR CALL, it's still Dream Theater!<br /><br />If you are flexible and open to new stuff, especially from DT - ABSOLUTELY!<br /><br />If you are an extreme, die hard Dream Theater fan.

0374105235|5.0|Ishmael's tale is one each person living in the West should be required to read. The atrocious war is Sierra Leone is one few people today have even heard of. Ishmael's account of the vicious RUF and his time with the SLA as a child soldier is at times graphic, yet almost poetic. His style of writing is so gripping, I was unable to put the book down until I finished. While some may be squeamish when reading the gory details provided by the author, try to imagine the millions of people this civil war, fought over diamonds, were affected. This is a story that needed to be told, and although I believe Greg Campbell did his journalistic best in \\"Blood Diamonds,\\" Ishmael's first-hand account in his memior is far superior. I cannot imagine how this young man, one not much older than myself, survived. Since he was able to survive, it is our moral responsibility to read his story.
0553106635|4.0|This series is AWESOME! I love the first two books. I havnt finished this book; however, I have already ordered the fourth book.  This book and the others is not for the weak of heart!  Lets just say- George R. R. Martin is not afraid to kill of characters.  I start to fall in love with a character and before I know it, he or she is dead. It has many plot twists and paraphrasing an underlying theme , \\"Life is not a song.\\" I'm hoping the series has a happy ending where the main characters are avenged. Anyone who read this book will agree with me- I hope the Freys burn in hell.
1596680296|5.0|This book gives clear and concise directions/explainations for all tecniques needed to knit socks.  I knit my first pair of socks very successfully with the basic pattern, and the book still has enough variety of patterns to keep me busy for a long time.  I think even experienced sock knitters will find something new in this book.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I purchased this CD for a birthday present for my mom. Anyone who enjoyed the Once More With Feeling episode is sure to love this soundtrack.  It even has a few extra songs in the track, and a really nice, lengthy overview by Joss Whedon himself in the cover sleeve.
0316067598|5.0|This is one of the best military books I have ever read, even better than Blackhawk Down. It needs to be read by anyone questioning the dedication, courage, and perseverance of our military.     The training of Navy Seals is meticulously reported, tough enough to make any grown man wince, and the resulting capabilities of these brave men are clear. The mission, which failed, and resulted in the death of three of the four in the team, as well as many who sought to rescue them, is described with cold, brutal frankness and deep regard and affection for those who lost their lives. I started the book in the morning and finished it the same day. I could hardly put it down. It is a great book about present day American heroes, who found themselves vastly outnumbered because their innate sense of right and wrong did not allow them to kill a possibly innocent herder, who was an informant who did in fact betray their presence to hundreds of the enemy. They were truly good and just men who fought and died bravely and nobly.
B00000J2SR|5.0|It stays intense, song after song, but not by relying on sheer guitar power so much like you find with, say, Rainbow's previous Straight Between the Eyes album.  Turner can't really scream it out as much as other vocalists Blackmore has recorded with, so Turner's screaming it out on some places in SBTE was pushing it a bit.  The vocals and adjusted heavier sound there may have come as overcompensation for the distinctly pop-sounding \\"Difficult To Cure\\" album before it.  But here, the vocals and intrumentals finally come together beautifully, and for the whole disk, not just a song or two.  The creative use of keyboards rounds out the music really nicely and doesn't date it - no more than it dates Deep Purple's \\"Perfect Strangers\\" - as overuse of keyboards has often done with music from the 80s (hence the term \\"80s Butt Rock\\"?!).    Not only is this much too intense to be written off as pop (and too awesome to be \\"written off\\" as anything) you get all the great style and influence that you've come to expect with Ritchie Blackmore and the great musicians he has worked with over the years.  I usually go after staight forward hard rock and roll (AC/DC, VAN HALEN, UFO, etc.).  While some might say this disk may have a \\"softer\\" approach in some ways, it definitely isn't missing anything for pace or intensity, and each song brings something new to the table:  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone with even just a casual interest in Deep Purple, Rainbow, or Joe Lynn Turner.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I recently saw this show in Los Angeles. By that time Wicked had been playing for some time and, if I am not mistaken, had already toured through town once before. So I went with some pretty high expectations. Given my anticipation and the possibility of a let down, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The book and staging were extremly clever and the performances, especially by the two leads, were genuinely exciting. Unfortunately, I cannot say much for the music. It was servicable and got the plot from point A to point B. There wasn't one moment, however, that genuinely moved me. Each song moved along in an inoffensive way, neither contributing nor seriously damaging the proceedings. Given the talent of the singers this is a genuine shame. They worked hard but had nothing really solid to fall back on. The show can be recommended but I can't say much for the CD.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|Been a huge fan since I first heard them in '97 and have never been disappointed.  This album definitely took the band back to the days of Sing Loud, Sing Proud and even The Gangs All Here!  I finally got to catch them in Savannah Georgia last month, (what the hell took so long to come down here?!!), and took a couple of friends of mine who had really only heard The Warrior's Code album.  They seemed to enjoy the show but commented on the way out that the band \\"didn't play enough songs from that album\\".  I was very disheartened to hear someone say such a thing because that means they really missed out on a moving experience.  Plus, I had been waiting 10 years to see this band and these guys got to see them a couple of months after first hearing them.  I tried to get them into the older albums but they just don't seem to get it.  There was even a comment by another \\"fan\\" on the way out saying, \\"Al Barr sucks!\\"  Well what the hell did you pay to come to the show for then?  If you wanna see  Mike McColgan sing then go see the Street Dogs.  Reminded me alot of the straight edge skins that I used to see paying to get into Fugazi shows just so they could flip off Ian Mackaye. Being 37 years old now, I realize that my days of going to punk shows are quickly coming to an end but this was one that I'll always remember and cherish.  As for The Meanest of Times, it's a phenomenol album with the fist pumping choruses of hard honest music that they have mastered with each new endeavor.  This band has definitely got many years of kickin' arse ahead of them and I thank God that I'm alive to to hear it!!  Meanest of Times couldn't have been better!!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|\\"Grindhouse\\" divided the film geeksters (I have a platinum membership, thank you) into two camps - either you love this or you hate it.  No luke warm \\"meh\\" reactions here.  I truly dug it, but I had some issues.    That being said, Tarantino's theatrical \\"Deathproof\\" to me always felt unfinished and ultimately ackward in it's timing, the key element in all of his stuff - from the editing, to the music and dialogue...if it's off, it doesn't really work the way that it should.    I watched this version for the first time last night and was literally dazzled by the genius that is Q and his partner in crime Sally Menke.  Gone are the dead-end moments of \\"huh?\\" and replaced with \\"ooo's\\" & \\"ahhh's\\".  The extra footage (especially the lapdance and black & white parking lot stalking sequence) is what really ties it together for me - it's the grease this piece needed to flow & hum like I knew that it could.    Haven't even checked out the extras on the 2nd disc, but already feel this was the best $22 I've spent in a blue moon.    Hope \\"Planet Terror\\" Unrated & Uncut turns out this cool.
B00000EYHF|5.0|When I was a Freshman in high school and you happened to buy my history book used, you would have had all of the lyrics to all of the songs off of \\"Too Tough To Die\\" as I wrote them all over that book. An awesome Ramones album!!!
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|Not that its a bad CD, but if you've heard the Datsuns, Jet, The Darkness, and the Hard side of the White Stripes, then you've heard this one. Like the Datsuns, this is heavy without a lot of substance or creative riffs. Wolfmother could develope into great things if they evolve their own sound and break away from the pack. Again, not a bad CD. If you haven't heard the bands listed above, this will probably sound ground breaking to you.
1587263963|5.0|Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.    I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.     Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.     In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.
B000QXDED6|5.0|I am not writing this to argue how great this movie was or any of that madness. Personally, I loved it. I have to admit it was to much CGI but other than that, it was pretty entertaining. I did not expect an Acadamy award winner like everyone else. Nor was I expecting something true to history. I mean common, it was based on a comic book people! I laugh at the reviews saying it was not true to history and that it was a Gladiator rip off. Well to tell you the truth, at the end of 300 when he was in the wheat fields with his family, same thing happened in Gladiator. I went to see this movie with a group of men simply just to see some action/killing. Common admit it, some of you all did too. Sure sometimes the movie got repetitive, I will admit that. The movie is not perfect, and a lot of idiots out there are blasting it because its \\"supposed\\" to be perfect. I purchased a copy when it came out and I have yet to watch it again. Why is that? Because I am to busy re watching Casino and Goodfellas. And for Gladiator, I watch that once every two days. There are plenty of better movies out there that will keep you interested. But when that primal instinct for action comes over you, just watch key scenes from 300 and you will be okay. So if this review did not help, its not going to hurt my feelings at all. Just wanted to talk to my fellow movie buffs that all.
B000UBMZ4S|4.0|A Fantastic Movie with muliple levels of meaning.  I love this view of the future.
B000NRPJEW|3.0|Admito que las adaptaciones cinematográficas de novelas que han gustado suelen defraudar al espectador que fue apasionado lector de las mísmas.    Pero es que, Alatriste no es una adaptación de una novela, ... ¡sino de cinco!     Hagamos uso del sentido común, tratemos de imaginarnos qué puede ocurrir al condensar 5 novelas en 2 horas de película... ¿no es razonable pensar que pueden quedarse muchas cosas en el tintero? ¿Que la historia puede resultar demasiado veloz y complicada de seguir?    Pues así es: a pesar de haberme leído -y releído- las novelas de Pérez Reverte, durante la película había momentos en que me costaba seguir el hilo, tales eran los saltos en tiempo y en lugar, y circunstancias de la historia. ¡Con lo que habría dado de sí hacer una saga a lo Indiana Jones, o haber recurrido, simplemente, a basar el guión en una cualquiera de las 5 novelas de Alatriste! Tal vez, de este modo, se podría haber sacado partido a los personajes, y todo...    Porque, lo cierto, es que hay miríadas de personajes, variados, interesantísimos y de mucha entidad en la acción novelada que, traspuestos al cine, quedan sin desarrollar, personajes que pasan de ser elementos clave, a convertirse en gentucilla \\"que pasa por ahí\\" y gracias si dicen media frase. Son mero atrezzo.    En fin, y ya que estamos con los personajes, demos un repaso al reparto, porque esta película es todo un desfile de caracteres:    ->CAPITÁN ALATRISTE: VIggo Mortensen me ha sorprendido. Es un actor al que tengo repelús y admito haber catalogado de proto-guaperas-ñoño para adolescentes, pero lo cierto es que, físicamente, el papel le cuadra. La presencia física es un punto a su favor. Lástima la voz como de haberse desayunado una botella de aguardiente. ¿Y porqué habla tan despacio? En fin, a pesar de la crítica, tiene sus momentos. Es una pena que el guión no entre más en el detalle de analizar la personalidad de Alatriste, la verdad, es demasiado limitado en esesentido. Creo que Mortensen podía dar más de sí, pero no ha habido ocasión, porque se pasa más tiempo descerrajando tajos con la vizcaína que hablando.     ->IÑIGO BALBOA: Unax Ugalde, ufffff,... se han reinventado tanto el personaje de Íñigo que no reconozco al muchacho que debía haber sido. ¿Y ése pendiente a lo jarrai? ¿Y las deudas de juego? ¿Y el trabajo de matarife? ¿Y las ganas de abandonar a los suyos para irse con Angélica? ¿Y los andares chulescos al medirse en duelo con Gualterio Malatesta? Parece que quieren darle un cierto carácter de bala perdida que, el personaje original, no tiene en las novelas, más bien es todo lo contrario. Dicho esto, añadir que Unax es joven y aún tiene que aprender bastante el oficio, a mí no me convence su interpretación.    ->QUEVEDO: Tras los anteojos quevediandos se esconde un, para mi gusto brillante, Juan Echanove. Pero apenas tiene papel, ni el guión le permite profundizar en el caráter mordaz y de poeta genial, un poco amargadete, amigo de sus amigos y temible espadachín, de su personaje. Ayyyy,... ¡¡ Lástima de personaje y actor desaprovechados !!     ->GUADALMEDINA: Eduardo Noriega es otro ejemplo de personaje e interpretación que se quedan en poquito, porque sólo aparece tres o cuatro veces. Se transforma de bueno a malo y, casi, ni te enteras de porqué ni exactamente cuándo, tan rápida es su evolución que no resulta creíble. Una pena.    -> OLIVARES: Javier Cámara... pasa desapercibido.     -> GUALTERIO MALATESTA: otro desperdicio de actor y papel. Enrico Lo Verso está muy convincente, pero le han dado poquitas frases y aparece tan fugazmente que, en escenas como la del barco, sólo te enteras si te has leído el libro. Por cierto, qué curioso el detalle histórico del Grecian 2000, se le oscurecen las canas al pasar el tiempo.    -> MARíA DE CASTRO: Ariadna Gil sale muy guapa, pero su interpretación es muy flojita.     -> ANGÉLICA DE ALQUéZAR: Otro personaje a la basura. Me da igual que la actriz no sea rubia, incluso diría que físicamente da el típo de Angélica de sobra, pero el personaje creado no tiene nada que ver con el del libro, que es mucho más complejo. En la película...¡¡ hasta parece buena !! Y, su interpretación, mejorable.     Otros personajes, como Copons (éste me gustó mucho), Curro Garrote, el alguacil cornudo, Luis De Alquézar, Felipe IV,... pasan de puntillas, y cuando repiten escena ni recuerdas quienes son. En general, los soldados y amigos de Alatriste sí están logrados, qué pena que salgan tan poco.    Tal vez estoy siendo muy crítica, cuando lo cierto es que me ha gustado más que lo que se suele ver en las salas de cine, pero siendo las novelas de aventuras originales excepcionales, yo esperaba ver una buena película de aventuras, y no ha sido así.    Como cosas muy buenas, citaré:    - me ha encantado la fotografía, con luces que recordaban a las de los cuadros de Velázquez, y preciosas composiciones, muy barrocas.  - fenomenal ha sido, también, el gusto con el que se han escogido los escenarios, tanto los interiores como los exteriores, a excepción de Rocroi. Por favor, que alguien le explique al guionista o a quien sea el responsable, que no tiene sentido que los españoles estén de espaldas a una fortaleza francesa y de frente a los franceses, y mucho menos que los franceses tengan tras de sí, a 100 metros, ¡¡sus tiendas de campaña!! Lo lógico es que los gabach... digo, franceses, salgan de la fortaleza y los españoles del campamento. ¿Para qué están ahí las tiendas de campaña de los franceses, son por si les da un apretón en mitad de la batalla? ¡¡QUe no hace falta ser Napoleón para darse cuenta!!  - la caracterización y elección de los actores que interpretan personajes históricos, excepcional, para poner un 10.   - vestuarios y maquillaje: magníficos.     Como cosas menos buenas:    -demasiados degollados y amputados por doquier. La mayoría de los diálogos sereducían a \\"ay, ay, ay,...\\" La historia debe ser dura, los libros lo son, pero también puede serlo sin ser escabrosa (como Psicosis, por ejemplo). Un poco más de elegancia, por Dios.  -que María de Castro esté hecha una rosa y en la escena siguiente tenga sífilis,... huyyyy...  -no queda claro qué pintan los ingleses en Madrid, y no se dice qué acaba ocurriendo con ellos.  - Malatesta a veces parece bueno. ¡Seamos serios!  - ¿quién ha acusado a Íñigo de espía francés? ¿Angélica? No conseguí enterarme.   - Alatriste y Copons jamás llamarían cabrón al Rey (aunque lo piensen). Son enfermizamente leales. No lo he comprobado, apostaría a que han hecho, a Copons, tomar prestado el insulto de otro personaje.    Bueno, creo que el repaso ha sido más exhaustivo de lo que yo misma esperaba. Tengo la sensación de haber visto seguidas muchas fotos, muy aptas para ilustrar las novelas de Pérez Reverte. ¿Os imagináis tomar un libro ilustrado y pasar rápidamente las hojas, viendo desfilar una tras una las láminas (muy bellas, por cierto)? El efecto que produce la película es casi el mismo.     En resumen, la peli es fiel a Alatriste, en el sentido de que tiene luces y sombras. Mi conclusión es que, a nuestro cine de aventuras le falta madurar, aunque la peli se puede ver. Es una forma de apoyarlo.    Y, para concluir, sólo quería añadir una cosa... ¡lástima que no hubiera tenido en sus manos John Ford las novelas de Alatriste!¡ Vivediós... !    Saludos a vuesas mercedes...
B0007TKNKG|3.0|Its just an Ok movie. Sure, you could rip apart the plot, the acting, pretty much anything about this movie, but why? You should not buy this movie to see a great film about overcoming the odds and rivaling Kramer vs. Kramer. Its a movie about driving trucks and arm wrestling guys that drink oil. And in the end, isn't that all that really matters?
B000GYI32M|2.0|Well, this is by far the worst season of the series and possibly the reason why the show lost so much of its fans. They try to reuse ideas that worked for season 1 and the second time around it seems old and boring. Personally, the character of marissa becomes extremely annoying and the series arc is dissapointing. But if you're an OC fan like me you'll probably still end up buying this season
B0002CHIJW|4.0|This was an Ok movie. It is not for everyone and not the type of movie you just watch because your bored. Its a violent, mean film. But vengeance is the name of the game, from a female viewpoint. Revenge flicks will always be made, in theaters now we have Death Sentence and The Brave One. So, if you like revenge films, check it out but please, do not have any children present.
B000UGG3A0|3.0|Thanks alot DKM. I'm sure all the punk purists who were whining over the last 3 albums will just love you guys now. But for me, I can't help but feel ripped off. You release 2 great songs, The State of Massachusetts and Flannigan's Ball, make me so psyched for a great celtic punk masterpiece, and I get this; a bland punk album with a few songs with any Celtic influence.<br />The first 3 songs are phoenominal(sp?). Then it goes to some okay DKM punk rock. Okay, not that bad; but I am waiting for a good celtic punk song. They've completely butchered Flannigan's Ball. The guest singers simply sound terrible and ruin the mood of the song. Also, they made ballads sound good before, but they're just boring now. The bagpipes are absent through alot of the album, which made me hope for more use of the tin wistle, but I was let down there too. DKM can do really great punk; The Gang's All Here for example is an awesome album, with hardly any Irish influenced songs. Take It And Run from The Warrior's Code is by far one of my favorite DKM songs. They can do great punk, but they don't do it on The Meanest of Times.<br />I have to say I was very disappointed. It seems that this album is an answer to all the punk whiners. The great songs are The State of Massachusetts, Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya, God Willing, Loyal To No One, and Famous For Nothing. There are some other songs that are above average.<br /><br />This album really is the meanest of times for the Dropkick Murphys.
B0006GANOQ|4.0|Talk about a WILD RIDE!  Action, explosions, suspense, mystery, twists, turns, surprises, chemistry, romance, its got it all!!!  You'll be very surprised Keanu and Sandra have not worked together again until The Lake House (which is great too!) A mad bomber has started a spree and specifically drags in Keanu to try and catch him if he can.  Excellent movie!
B000002KLP|5.0|A massive step up from the self-titled sophomore album: for one, he massively improved the ballads (the oft-covered \\"When You Were Mine\\", debatably Prince's breakthrough single - it's amusing how so many people have covered a song about a massive orgy; the more underrated, very worthwhile \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" - I gotta say, both pound \\"When We're Dancing Close and Slow\\" into the dirt). But this is Prince, he's bad, he's funky, and he can really lay the x-rated funk down (no pun intended, that one's too easy a shot). You've heard the minimalist (mostly guitar, bass, and drums, with a lot of keyboards) imaginative funk song \\"Uptown\\", right? Come on, who doesn't like that song? And who can't get down to it? I love that one! The third hit was \\"Head\\", another stripped-down funk jam that's about exactly what you think. The keyboards are insane there! I love them! Prince just about invented rap on this album, in my mind (which is considerably cleaner than Prince's) - he doesn't have the delivery right, but he's got the backdrop, the beats, and the subject matter (title song; \\"Do It All Night\\"; the punkish \\"Sister\\" - between its title, and the general tone of the record, I invite you to take a stab at interpreting it). This is one of my First Triumvirate of Prince albums (am I a nerd, or am I a nerd?), along with Purple Rain and Emancipation. But it's in the #3 slot, simply because it's not a total genre-bender like Purple Rain or Emancipation. And \\"Partyup\\" is just okay. Still, this is an awesome record. Be sure to buy it if you like Prince. And even if the subject matter scares you off, you can just ignore the lyrics and focus on the grooves.
B00008L3U1|4.0|If you liked Patch Adams you'll like Jack!  Excellent emotional, heart-warming, you'll feel sad movie.  Story of a child (Jack) with a disease that makes him age about 3 years to 1; so at 10 he looks and internally is 30.  It follows his life and all the positives (created by his family) and negatives created by others, he must face.  10 hankie movie.
B000002KMV|4.0|A lot of people think this is a massively disappointing follow-up to Dirty Mind, a slightly uneven record, and whatever else have you. I disagree. I mean, sure, it's not as good as Dirty Mind, but Dirty Mind was a watershed release, and one can only have so many of those. Let's start at the beginning, with the superb title track. It's Prince's first hyper-extended one-man jam (over seven minutes!), and it's got all kinds of hooks: superb little keyboard riff, the chorus, the melody, and the \\"Some people call me rude\\" chant near the end. Sure, the lyrics are very self-centered, dispelling many myths about Prince at the time, but I don't give a damn. It's songs like this that makes Prince such an amazing artist, see? And those lyrics, self-centered as they are, do have some gems to be found, my favorite is \\"Do I believe in God, do I believe in me? Some people want to die so they can be free... controversy!\\" Then he churns out some trademark Prince funk-rock with the dirty lyrics that are really a \\"free-your-mind\\" type thing, kinda like \\"Uptown\\" (\\"Sexuality\\"). No, \\"Sexuality\\" isn't as good as \\"Uptown\\", but that's because of \\"Uptown\\"'s extreme quality, not \\"Sexuality\\"'s lack thereof. Then he follows that up with one of his trademark sultry, undeniable slow jams (\\"Do Me, Baby\\"). On the second side, Prince gets farther into experimental territory than he ever had been before. \\"Private Joy\\" isn't anything Prince hasn't done before (though the \\"orgasmatron\\" lyric is hilarious!), but the guitar! Listen to the guitar! Listen to the guitar!!! Are you listening to it yet? Good! Now make me a ham sandwich, hold the cheese. So, riiiiiiight... back to the crazy experimental stuff. I don't even know what to call \\"Ronnie, Talk to Russia\\", other than, \\"Um, a bunch of whacko guitars and bomb sounds?\\", but I like it, I guess. And I know I like the pulsating disco-funk song \\"Let's Work\\". Nothing Prince hasn't done before, but good. I don't like the last two songs, though: one is just waaaaaaaay too out-there (\\"Annie Christian\\"), and the other is just way too dumb, stereotypical, clich&eacute; Prince (\\"Jack U Off\\"). Two atrocious songs, here to screw over an otherwise superb album. Why, Prince? Why???aaaaaaay too out-there (\\"Annie Christian\\"), and the other is just way too dumb, stereotypical, cliché Prince (\\"Jack U Off\\"). Two atrocious songs, here to screw over an otherwise superb album. Why, Prince? Why???
B00000IQV7|4.0|One of Robin's best performances!  Very lovable character, that will make you smile many times.  The kind of guy a lot of people would love to be like.  Story of a man at the end of his line, who has a revelation about life and his situation that creates a dramatic change.  Very, enjoyable movie.
B000005RRP|2.0|I've said it before, and I probably will say it again: Deep Purple is a massive joke, and I have no grasp of their appeal. So many other '70s musicians (not to mention numberous acts of the '50s - mostly either jazz or Chuck Berry, '60s, '90s, and even the decrepit '80s) blew them away. I won't make a list, though, because I don't want to turn out like a certain pair of amazon reviewers, but a lot of awesome hard rock, new wave, progressive rock, funk, and jazz came out during the decade (best artists were the Rolling Stones and Stevie Wonder).<br />So what's so bad about Deep Purple? I mean, besides everything? No brains. AC/DC wasn't the smartest band either, but dammit, they were fun! And unlike the Purps, they had an idea of their capabilities: no way would they spin off into something as hilariously inadequate as the \\"epics\\" No, No, No, Fools and No One Came. I suppose I should feel glad that there's nothing as repulsive as Child in Time on this record, but there's also blundering incompetence such as the Dylanesque Anyone's Daughter and the drum solo on The Mule.<br />The good news is that there are a couple genuine butt-kickers on this album. Even I'll admit that Demon's Eye rocks: my favorite DP song, easily. So does Strange Kind of Woman, a single released from the era that was left off the UK version of the album; Demon's Eye, meanwhile, was cut from the US one. Why couldn't they have blasted No, No, No into oblivion and put Strange Kind of Woman AND Demon's Eye on the damn thing?  The title track's kind of good too.<br />For their next trick, this group of legendary dunderheads would pump out an almost-good album (Machine Head) that featured a couple pretty good hits, especially Smoke on the Water, that nonetheless was riddled with all kinds of fillers. Then they'd put out a bunch of albums with David Coverdale and a ton of other people that I don't have and probably never will. Amazingly, they're still going strong today, though thankfully minus partners in grime Ritchie Blackmore (guitar) and Jon Lord (organ) - unfortunately, nauseating frontman Ian Gillain is back in action, screeching away. And THIS is a legendary rock band? Ha! It is to laugh...itchie Blackmore (guitar) and Jon Lord (organ) - unfortunately, nauseating frontman Ian Gillain is back in action, screeching away.

0316067598|5.0|I almost missed the unique opportunity to gain priceless insights into the beginning, middle and sadly, far from the end of the riveting news which confronts Americans with no let-up and that is the seemingly, mystery conflict with ORGANIZED TERRORISTS, be they Taliban or Al Quida but going with 'gut instincts', I bought and read this book in one night and WELL into the morning hours.  Couldn't close the book, literally, on the fascinating, fearsome, frightful and terrifying experiences of a Navy Corpsman and his 3 companions, all U.S. Navy SEALS, who were secretly inserted into the high, wild Afghanistan mountains charged with the task of locating the the Taliban headquarters.  This personal account of these truly heroic men and the detailed and virtually incredible confrontation with the enemy is compelling testimony to the literally selfless dedication of our fighting forces in their weary, continuing battle with an enemy, inevitably indistinguishable, from a Native civilian.  The decisions which must be made should confront no person, ever, but they are so confronted endlessly!  This is a compelling read and is no surprise why it has remained a best seller for so many weeks.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Fracture, which came out on DVD this year, is an entertaining film that will intrigue the audience until all the secrets are revealed.  In the movie a young on-the-rise lawyer is given a murder case that is supposed to be a done deal.  The case is about an engineer who killed his wife and then signed a confession.  However, there is much more going on than what appears.     The director, Gregory Hoblit, has directed other movies like \\"Hart's War\\", \\"Frequency\\", and \\"Fallen\\".  Most of his works deal with law enforcement and legal matters of some sort.     The main actors are Anthony Hopkins (the criminal) and Ryan Gosling (the young lawyer).  Hopkins has played the role of the bad guy in many movies, most notably the role of Hannibal Lecter in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Hannibal\\", and \\"Red Dragon\\".   Ryan Gosling is most famous for his role in the movie \\"The Notebook\\".  He has also played in movies such as \\"Remember the Titans\\", and \\"Half Nelson\\".       This film is an excellent example of a movie that will keep the audience guessing until the very end.  The manipulative power of the criminal in the movie is mind-boggling.  While the determination to prove himself by the young lawyer is a feeling that everyone can relate to.  The storyline of this movie is incredibly calculated.  The audience is given just enough information to make predictions about the outcome and what will happen to the characters.  This movie is more a battle of the mind and wits than of the sword.     Hopkins does an excellent job playing the role of a mastermind who only appears to not have a plan.  Hopkin's ability to make the audience feel contempt for his character is unbelievable.  The words he uses, and even more, the way he says them has a way of making the audience have a great dislike for his character.    Gosling also does a fine bit of acting in the movie.  His role of a young lawyer who is on the rise is very believable.  He shows maturity throughout the film by his willingness torisk his future to do what he knows is right.        The movie rating is R for strong language and a couple scenes of violence that are not suitable for children.  This movie targets teenagers and adults who are looking for a good thriller with a twist ending.
B00005JCAA|5.0|The 3 hours were over in a flash! I am very discerning about what I watch and have never recommended a movie, in writing, before.  I cannot believe that \\"Meet Joe Black\\" was not a movie block-buster. It's richness..... in touching every nuance of human emotion is delicious. The delights of beauty, sound and emotion were fabulous.  The story line and acting stimulated feelings in me that I have not experienced in any other movie.  If you cannot enjoy this movie and all it has to offer..then life must be lacking in some important ways for you.  I have no movie idols or even favorites....yet..  Brad Pitt as \\"Death\\" will remain forever as a powerful characterization for me.  Hardly anyone in reviews I read spoke of the hospital scenes with the dying woman.  This is one of the riveting keys to the plot.  And to all who find meaning in this film, I ask of you  to watch again the last moments and answer this question..\\"did death leave some aspect of itself here to love?\\"  R Newton

B000HEWEE4|1.0|It is not the fact that so many people/reviewers found this movie rates 3, 4 or even 5 stars--to each his own. What I find truly amazing is the tremendous quality of the reviews (especially those on the low rating end).      Some of the better 1 and 2 star reviews exhibit more intellect and display a higher level of quality in their writing than the collaborators of this movie even come close to.    I just had to comment. By the way what was Christopher Plummer's contribution to the plot? I guess that sums up the problem with the whole movie.
B000002KIE|5.0|Perhaps one of the greatest albums of all time. The Pistols are a defining band, with a defining sound and a defining look. Marketing? Yes but name a band today that is not popular becasue of marketing.     This is one that you can listen to over and over and it never grows old.

I always say, \\"everyone has an interesting story.\\"  Well, this writer chose to write a book about hers and I loved it.  Who hasn't questioned their own decisions in life?  Who can say 100% that each one of their decisions is perfect - no regrets.  This writer is saying she's not perfect.  Her marriage wasn't perfect.  Her love life wasn't perfect.  She's trying to figure things out and create something each one of us is capable of...fulfillment in life.  Self-absorbed?  More like humble.  More like honest.  I hope I learn from this to take more chances in life.  Just because her journey is different than you or I would choose, doesn't mean it's wrong.  It's her interesting journey.
B000QEIORG|5.0|I hadn't bought this CD before, so I didn't already have most of the songs, but even if I had, I would have to rebuy it so I got the covers and b-sides added to the end.  They are amazing!  Of course I heard \\"Baker Street\\" on the radio years ago and enjoyed it, but I didn't discover Foo Fighters' version of Gary Numan's \\"Down in the Park\\" and I really think it's right up there in the realm of Gary Numan covers (the St Etienne version of \\"Stormtrooper in Drag\\" and Magnetic Fields version of \\"I Die: You Die\\" are the best).  It is great how they take an electronic song and make it more \\"rock\\" by having no keyboards.    But the piece de resistance of this CD is Foo Fighters' cover of ... wait for it ... Vanity 6!  I don't know that I've seen any Vanity 6 covers before, but the fact that Foo Fighters loved them enough to do a cover of \\"Drive Me Wild\\" is just a testament of what a great band they are.    So you must buy this CD!

B00005JO5L|3.0|I saw this film recently on Sundance (or IFC) after not seeing it for years.  It's a really perplexing work.  As a time capsule, it's fascinating.  It was shot in NYC in 1980 when the city was dying all around, and many of these gay \\"meat markets\\" were in full swing.  The gay bar scenes are incredibly intense and realistic, and they can still shock most viewers today.  The film has a real dirge, detached atmosphere to it, giving it an unexplainable vibe.  The dialogue is flatly rendered, and at first I disliked this.  This may have been due to gay groups very loud protests during the actual shooting.  While they were location shooting in NYC, various gay groups disturbed the filming by shouting, whistling, blowing off sirens, etc., etc., in other words, they made sound recording almost impossible.  On the featurette (which is fascinating), the producer and Friedkin said they took a month and a half to do ADR (automatic dialogue replacement) on the film.  I believe gay groups were angry that the \\"leather scene\\" was the only type of gay subculture portrayed in the film, and I understand their concerns, but that was no reason to attempt and stop the film being made, which is essentially what they did.<br /><br />The film's plot isn't particularly well developed, and Pacino's character is mostly confused (as is his performance, which supposedly he was unhappy with).  Friedkin made one of the greatest gay films ever with The Boys in the Band, but here his film feels exploitative, like he enjoyed showing the bondage/leather gay scene of NYC instead of showing relatively straightforward gay people.  The film feels unfinished, but not by design.  The only deliberate ambiguity I feel is the ending.  SPOILER.  The killer is caught, but a murder happens after the killer is caught which is indirectly connected to the case, and that really leaves a creepy vibe when the film ends.<br /><br />Look quickly for James Remar and Ed O'Neil as a gay roomate and a detective, respectively.  The film is worth watching at least once, but it's not a \\"lost masterpiece\\".is worth watching at least once, but it's not a \\"lost masterpiece\\".
1567315682|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite financial books because it is based on actual research of the affluent, not just one person's opinion or experience. It is very interesting that according to the authors, most millionaires are actually very thrifty people, which is in part how they were able to accumulate their wealth.  What better way is there to try to become wealthy than following the patterns of others who have already accomplished the same goal?  I have this book all marked up and keep refering to it again and again over the years.  I think it would be a great book for young adults to read to help them to get an early start on the road to financial security and thrifty living.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|The tapes of the old Johnny Cash Show are a real snapshot of an era when songwriting and performance were highly prized.  This 2 disc set presents an outstanding collection of performances culled from the series featuring a wide range of artists.  Johnny Cash was a fearless promoter of good songs no matter who was performing them.  So in addition to the country stars you might expect on his show, he also had the major rock bands and folk artists of the day.  You get performances from such country legends as George Jones, Charlie Pride, Merle Haggard, and Loretta Lynn, alongside performers such as Eric Clapton, Dylan, Ray Charles, and Neil Young.  The show was set up such that all the performances are done live-- no lipsyncing here, botched or otherwise!  And Cash often sits with his guests and does a duet, which makes for some memorable moments.  For instance, he does Jimmie Rodgers' Blue Yodel #9 with Louis Armstrong playing trumpet along with him.  And Ray Charles does a seemingly impromptu version of Cash's own Walk the Line.  Another fine moment is when Cash, Carl Perkins, and Eric Clapton team up to perform an old standard song (accompanied by the rest of Derek and the Dominoes, in a rare TV appearance).  Clapton is standing there next to Perkins, one of his heros, and he looks almost intimidated.  To see someone like Clapton be practically shy around one of the people who inspired him to play is a wonderful moment. And of course the one man who could straddle all these various musical worlds and bring them together is Cash himself.  This DVD set is a real tribute to him.
0292701934|4.0|This is a useful book for anyone who is intersested in Richard Avedon's work \\"In The American West\\" and should be considered as a companion volume to Avedon's book.  It gives a lot of background, both to individual images and to the \\"In the West\\" project as a whole: how subjects were found, how the images were photographed, a sense of the time and effort involved, Avedon's method of work, some comments on particular subjects that particularly struck the crew.  My only real complaint about the book is that could have contained more information and would have been more interesting as a result.  For example, almost no precise technical information is given.  Even so, it does help one to understand Avedon's \\"In the West project\\", which I consider a significant piece of work.
B00005JO5L|4.0|The VHS tape I rented of this film was excellent; I bought the DVD not so much for a better print, as to hear Friedkin's voiceover of the film. There are confusing things in it, I thought; perhaps Friedkin will explajn them. Although it is very intersting to hear almost all of what Friedkin says (and he analyses almost every scene in detail), a summary might be: an intelligent viewer will agreee with Socretes that a wise man knows he knows nothing! Things I thought I understood were not meant to be understood, but to raise more questions.<br /><br />This doesn't mzke the film, or the commentary,  any less fascinating. It's also interesting to know that the film was lagely made as a real slice of life in that the leather bars, the hotel, and the minor actors (not acting)--were all real, and filmed on location, in 1979.<br /><br />The opposition to the making of the film, expressed in demonstrations by sections of the gay community in New York, are understandable (\\"Don't we have ENOUGH troubles?\\"), but objectively speaking, for anyone to take this film as representing the whole of gay life, at any time, would be the equivelent of watching an episode of \\"The Sopranos,\\" and concluding that all Italian-Americans made huge amounts of money dealing mostly illegally in mostly illegal goods, and that none of them had any understanding of the value of human life.<br /><br />The following poem came about with the realization that \\"Master and Commander\\" and \\"Cruising\\" end with exactly the same part of the same Boccherini quartet, and my initial consternation that I was not going to be told any more about the plot of the film than I already knew. In fact--less!<br /><br />There is one added line of dialogue, and some minor, but nifty special effects.<br /><br />  Boccherini Quartet<br /><br />  Two men, a captain and his first mate,<br />  Sit in the captain's cabin, and play Boccherini,<br />  The captain with his viola, the mate with an instrument<br />  I would call a cello--were it not so long ago. It is<br />  The most tuneful part of the quartet, ending in a<br />  Feathery lightness, as the scene dissolves to their four-masted ship<br />  Becoming little more than a spot on the great ocean.<br /><br />  A pretty girl puts a phonograph record on--why,<br />  The captain and the first mate are still playing, after all!<br />  They have begun their tune again.<br />  As she tries on a killer's hat, and her boyfriend's leather jacket,<br />  He is shaving in the bathroom mirror, and catches his own eyes there.<br />  Those great, dark eyes, thoughtful at first, and then, questioning: who am I now?  Their question overrides their sophistication, and the scene moves to<br />  The Hudson River, outside the window, as a dirty yellow tugboat<br />  Passes in front of the setting sun, to the feathery lightness<br />  Of the music.<br /><br />ADDENDA: yes, well, that's all very well. But Friedkin's screenplay acknowledges being based on a 1970 novel by Gerald Walker, which is a horror beyond your imagining--according to Russo (who occasionally makes mistakes). According to Vito Russo (\\"The Celluloid Closet\\"--the BOOK), because of the ambiguity of the film, it is possible to interpret the film this way: In Walker's book, a policeman goes undercover to trap a killer of homosexual men, and in the process, discovers his own homosexuality--and starts killing gays himself. According to Russo, homosexuality in the book is spread like being a vampire (one bite does the trick), and the book is not about \\"Cruising\\" being violent (which in itself is bad enough as a theory), but about homosexuality itself being violent.  For homophobes, ordinary, and gay people with this book in the back of their minds, THIS WILL NOT DO, obviously. Friedkin has changed the focus of his film--to soft. Pacino's character's sexuality may change (reveal itself as other than he thought it to be), and it may not. The \\"serial killer\\" turns out to be several killers (the killersare played by different actors)--WHY?, Pacino may have killed his friend (the last murder in the film)--though God knows why.<br /><br />Friedkin perhaps should have hung his script on a less horrifying book. However much he has changed, or softened it, it remains confusing--and open to the interpretation that Walker gave his novel. I like confusion, but being told that my lifestyle, or sexual proclivities, leads to self-hatred and hatred of him \\"who made me that way\\"--doesn't sit well at all.<br /><br />More addenda:<br /><br />A: My mother made me a homosexual!<br />B: Oh! If I buy the yarn--will she make me one too?ave killed his friend (the last murder in the film)--though God knows why.      Friedkin perhaps should have hung his script on a less horrifying book.

B000UJ24SC|5.0|This disc will tear your face off if played loud enough. The riffs on this disc along with the skin pounding and vokills outdo their previous work. Easily my best of 07.

0060254920|5.0|What child hasn't dreamed of being a wild animal, untamed and free? Of having no boundaries or restrictions?     In the magical world of a young boy's imagination, a wonderland can blossom. Sent to bed without supper for misbehaving, the unrepentant and spirited Max lets his imagination soar. His bedroom transformed into an exotic wilderness, Max sets sail across a deep blue sea to where the \\"wild things\\" are. After taming all of these fearsome monsters (turns out, he's the wildest of them all), the newly crowned \\"king of all wild things\\" leads them on quite a romp....until the lonely boy decides to return to the place where he is loved.     This journey into imagination is wonderful, whimsical and extraordinary. Small wonder that \\"Wild Things\\" was named the Caldecott Medal Winner for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year in 1964. Author/Illustrator Maurice Sendak has created a timeless classic - one which will always be among my personal favorites.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Another reviewer mentioned that having Echoes here was worth the price of the DVD alone. I would agree, and add that having Wots..Uh the Deal also makes this worth the bucks. Too many of these songs he has done before ad infinitum (do we really need another take on Coming Back to Life or High Hopes??), but having this great track from my favorite Floyd album \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", is just great! Since that album is probably their least known (and certainly most underrated, in my book), it may serve to convince people to go back and see where this beautiful song came from. Other than that, great picture and sound, and a ton of extras (not to mention what must be 3 1/2 hours of music), makes this one a must-have! And I only paid $11.99!!!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Just bought the double disc version of this.....completely blown away... Bowie and Gilmour doing Arnold Layne & Comfortably Numb...worth it for these two alone...Crosby, Dave, Nash, and Manzanera On an Island?...the rest is all just the icing on the cake...get this one now. Worth Every penny....Sound 10 Vision 7. There is a lot of glare in the lighting at times but I would say that would be almost impossible to compensate for, give the nature of dry ice + intense lighting (no evidence of grain). I still rate it a 5 star...despite this. I would expect that this is pretty much what you would see at the live show.  Over 5 Hours of Gilmour...Who can complain? very Highly Recommended
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Great movie. The whole family enjoyed this. I am never disappointed with Michael Keaton or Katie Holmes. Awesome and I highly recommend this movie.
044661758X|5.0|I love this series.    I started at the beginning and have enjoyed every book.   This is no exception.   Bosch is a great character and Connelly knows how to write a detective novel, no doubt about it.    The plots are always interesting and never predictable or trite.
055358202X|1.0|Where have all the editors gone?    With Feast, the 4th installment of the Song of Ice and Fire series, Martin has begun to get carried away with himself.  Much like what readers experienced with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, Feast represents a serious departure from the tight narrative drive that powered the first three books.    Very little time is spent on the characters we came to care about in past installments and, even worse, the \\"splitting\\" of this volume leaves several major characters out of the mix altogether.  The vast bulk of this book is dedicated to two characters who are either dead or marginalized by the end of the book and I found myself wondering how much of their plot impact could have been accomplished with several hundred less pages?      After all, if you spend 200 pages having someone wander about the countryside only to die at the end, the hope is they accomplished something that will have future plot implications.  If they didn't, you wasted our time.  If they did, then the importance of their accomplishment(s) must be weighed against the time taken to tell the story.  Without seeing the impact in book 6, it's impossible to say how much of book 4 was unnecessary drivel, but I suspect that much of it should have hit the editing room floor.    Eric-
B000UGG3A0|4.0|DKM is growing up and it shows in this album. The real question is - Who is DKM now? Are they a hardcore act or are they trying to become more like Flogging Molly?    If they are mellowing, I LIKE IT!!! No question, this album lacks the rawness and pure energy of some of their previous albums, but the leap forward in the folk sound is well worth it.    Where DKM has kept to their roots, things do seem a little tired. Does every song have to be a sing-along? Let's be real - an album can only have 1 true anthem.    DKM is a great live band and we all love singing the tunes. But when they record, it would be nice to hear 1 voice sometimes!!!    At the end of the day, a great record. DKM keeps getting better and I keep listening.
0780624890|3.0|1998's \\"Blade\\" features Wesley Snipes as the half-human, half-vampire defender of mankind against the predations of a secret race of vampires.  As Blade, the \\"Day-Walker\\", he marries the strength and power of a vampire to the ability to walk in daylight and to wield an array of martial arts weapons and skills.<br /><br />Blade is the hybrid product of a vampire's attack on his pregnant mother, kept from turning into an full-blown vampire by shots of garlic provided by his aging but cunning armorer, Whistler, played with sardonic grit and gristle by Kris Kristofferson.<br /><br />Blade's nemesis is Deacon Frost, the menacing young leader of the vampires, who is hot on the trail of an ancient ritual that will make him and his tribe unstoppable. The twist, unknown to Blade, is the role he will play in the successful recreation of that ritual, and the mortal danger the ritual poses for him and for his friends.  Frost cleverly draws Blade on toward a final confrontation at the site of the ritual that only one of them can survive.<br /><br />\\"Blade\\" is stylish in its theatrics, as the Day-Walker tracks his prey through the darkness, the city underground and the places where vampires play. The dialogue tends to campy; the mythology behind the ritual story is muddled at best, meant only to set up the final conflict between Blade and Deacon Frost.  The movie's strength is its superbly crafted action sequences, as Blade dispatches whole legions of vampires with a lethel combination of martial arts and swordplay.<br /><br />This movie is recommended as a flashy and solid action thriller and an interesting twist on the vampire legend.  Snipes is low-key but entirely credible and dangerous as a vampire hunter.
0066620996|5.0|In a previous review I dubbed a Blanchard text as the Management Bible. Good to Great goes one step further. It teaches how to lead. Leadership is very different from management. Management is about details and processes. Leadership is about creating a storyline, then using it to motivate, overcome, and exceed. Good to Great by Jim Collins is about greatness.<br /><br />The key to the \\"greatness storyline\\" is in identifying your Hedgehog Concept- that singular objective that will define your success. This also the most difficult part of leadership, an ability which most titled executives do not master. It is very easy to fall prey to the excuse that we \\"don't know what the future may bring\\" and we have to be \\"ready for anything\\". Hog wash. Or should I say hedgehog wash?<br /><br />Greatness can only be achieved through singular purpose. The core of Good to Great teaches us not only how to identify it (the hedgehog Concept), but how to embrace it. The remainder of the book tells us how to apply it in broad strokes. This is the essence of strategic planning. Being able to understand and acheive this should be a prerequisite for any leadership position. Or for any aspiring entrepreneur.

0393327655|2.0|Sam Harris's \\"The End of Faith\\" is an assault upon religion, blind faith, and fundamentalist violence. However, clear thinking Christians have little to fear from Harris's social critique.<br /><br />The majority of the book is an exposition of the evils, real or imagined, produced by religion. Harris discusses current atrocities, including September 11 and suicide bombings in Israel, as well as past atrocities, including the Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials. This leads to the natural question- if Harris (an atheist) is so critical of religious horrors, how can he explain the atheistic regimes of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot, which collectively were responsible for millions of deaths? Harris claims that, while they may not have been explicitly religious, these evil regimes were the result of poor thinking. He states in his afterword-<br /><br />\\"While some of the most despicable political movements in human history have been explicitly irreligious, they were not especially rational. The public pronouncements of these regimes have been mere litanies of delusion- about race, economics, national identity, the march of history, or the moral dangers of intellectualism.\\" [231]<br /><br />Thus, we see that The End of Faith does not really support atheism or oppose religion, it simply supports reason and opposes blind faith. Otherwise, his critique of religion is completely arbitrary, as he admits in this quoted passage that the real enemy is not simply religious faith, but irrationality itself. Thus, Harris needs to demonstrate that Christianity inherently necessitates irrational faith if he wishes to demonstrate that it should be rejected. Throughout the book, Harris merely assumes that so-called \\"fundamentalist\\" Christians can only exist through blind faith, but his assumption is both unproven and incorrect. Despite railing on about the supposed irrationality of religion, Harris never once deals with any of the arguments offered by Christians either historically or in the present day. There is no critique of the Cosmological Argument, no consideration of the evidence for the empty tomb, no critique of biblical passages or doctrines. Harris simply assumes that Christianity requires blind faith, argues that blind faith is both stupid and dangerous, and declares victory. The problem is that he has never shown that Christianity requires blind faith.<br /><br />The other problem with Harris's approach is a common one- he assumes that the misdeeds of religious followers invalidates the religion itself.<br /><br />Thus, the majority of Harris's book is simply not relevant for intelligent Christians. Surprisingly, however, there is some value in The End of Faith. For example, he discusses morality and makes a good case for charitable giving, and discusses politics and law, and makes a good case for the legalization of (some) drugs as a matter of public policy. However, as a critique of religion in general, and Christianity in particular, \\"The End of Faith\\" fails quite miserably.There is no critique of the Cosmological Argument, no consideration of the evidence for the empty tomb, no critique of biblical passages or doctrines.

B000AV2G3I|5.0|There is not much to be said about John Lennon that has not already been exhaustively stated. Suffice it to say that \\"Working Class Hero\\" is the best Lennon Anthology to date, a double disc reminder of just what light was snuffed out in December of 1980. There is enough brilliance here to make any casual fan happy, and a great start for the youngsters who may wonder why I locked myself in my dorm room and cried that awful day.<br /><br />Like all the Beatles' solo careers. Lennon's was not without its duffer moments. That means you will find the cream of his albums as well as all the relevant, brilliant singles. Even as history has slowly made Lennon into a one-dimensional icon (he was the serious Beatle with the social conscious!), these songs show the multiple facets of the man's world. Yes, there are the activist songs here, like \\"Power To The People\\" and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" (what would John be doing under GWB, one wonders) but there are the in-your-face confessionals like \\"Mother\\" and \\"Cold Turkey,\\" and the loving optimist of \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Love\\" to help to preserve the wide range of Lennon's worldview.<br /><br />In addition to that broad scope, Lennon was still a world class popsmith. His romp with Elton John, \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" and his joyful return to the charts in 1980, \\"Just Like Starting Over\\" are classical melodic joys, and it is hard to think up a song that has ever been as transcendent as \\"Imagine.\\" \\"Working Class Hero\\" also leans hard on \\"[[ASIN:B00004WGEK Double Fantasy]],\\" making the oddly contented songs like \\"Beautiful Boy,\\" \\"Watching The Wheels\\" and \\"Woman\\" feel like darts to the heart...after all, he was giving interviews and being very public about getting back into the game after his self-imposed sabbatical. Hearing the George Martin (!!!) produced version of \\"Grow Old With Me\\" to close out this set is enough to get you misty eyed.<br /><br />The songs sound great throughout. There are a few alternate takes (I prefer the Cheap Trick backed \\"I'm Losing You\\" to the original) and you can always backtrack and buy the full \\"[[ASIN:B0000457L2 Imagine]]\\" later. There is small comfort in knowing that John Lennon left us in the knowledge that his current music was being accepted and his body of work was still beloved...I guess we will always have that. But we will also always have the music. \\"I don't believe in Beatles, I believe in me...I used to be the walrus, but know I'm just John\\" he sang in \\"God.\\" \\"Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon\\" is a strong sampler of just how vital the music -- and John Lennon -- remains.Losing You\\" to the original) and you can always backtrack and buy the full \\"[[ASIN:B0000457L2 Imagine]]\\" later.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|Little Voice has easily become my favorite CD.  I find myself singing the songs to myself throughout the day.  Sara Bareilles has an amazing voice.  There is a nice jazz quality to her voice and the music.  You really get to appreciate the strength of her vocals on songs such as \\"Come Round Soon\\" and \\"Gravity\\".  Out of 12 songs the only one that I don't love is \\"Many The Miles\\" being a bit to gospel for my taste.  I find the more you listen to this disc the move you discover.  There is a love song on here for everyone, happy, breaking up or even those looking for the perfect mate.  Give this CD a try, you won't regret it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For cancelling this series, but if I get started on that now I'll never stop. The best way to watch this show is to pretend it's a TV miniseries and don't dwell on what might have been. The DVDs are fantastic. You can watch them over and over. The bonus material is fun. This set belongs in every DVD collection everywhere ever.

A 'Best Of' may be a good introduction but these three releases present a fuller, more substantial overview of her musical prowess.  If you have one or two of the above mentioned CDs, complete the trio over this 'Best Of' set.  And while you're at it, pick up the DVD version of 'Live In Paris' to see Diana perform great songs from these three CD releases.  The then-previously unreleased 'Taste Of You' remake will blow you away...
0143038419|5.0|This is a memoir of a successful woman who needed some time off after a bad divorce and went in search of herself and her spirituality. Totally unaware of what she'd find, she was very brave and admirably naiive in allowing these new experiences to happen to her. The writing is deeply personal in that she describes and shares her experiences so honestly. The woman puts it all out there for the world to read.<br /><br />I have come to find a great amount of peace and healing with myself and my own imperfections from reading about someone else's. I loved this book from start to finish and am surprised at the negative reviews about selfishness. (-We are so quick to condemn the things in others that we cannot accept or forgive about ourselves.) I do not know many people who could write so honestly and interestingly, about such personal experiences. So what that she had a book contract waiting. She's a writer! I think she made extraordinary good use of it. It's a memoir for goodness sake. It's her experience and who are any of us to condemn? I think it's great that she was brave enough to do it all so well and then write and share it.<br /><br />When Liz was on book tour with her friend and she crafted a petition to the Universe, I wanted to sign it myself! And, I thought it was a great idea and one that I'd like to try. When she screamed on the page that she didn't believe in God, and then a reply came, I got chills. I loved her descriptions of her depression and loneliness as if they were actual people. The story about the chant that she so resisted that she actually learned from made me think about and look at the things that I have fiercely resisted in my life to see if there was a larger meaning there. And, I cheered when beautiful things began to happen for her in ways that she never expected, it reaffirmed for me that yes there is always hope. There is light at the end of the tunnel.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The Lives of Others is a brilliant depiction of the perils of secret surveillance in East Berlin before the collapse of the wall. It is beautifully directd and acted by a superb cast.  The attention to detail is terrific and the subtle way in which the director builds both character and suspense is truly breathtaking.  It is a movie you will not soon forget.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I see a lot of movies. The lead actor, who died recently, shows his reactions minimally which increases their impact on the viewer. He has a wonderfully impassive face.<br />The story involves the viewer. We like the lovers. We admire the writer. We feel compassion for the actress. But most of all, we watch an inhuman man become human. The last line in the movie should bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded movie goer.

B00003CXCT|2.0|I watched the trilogy just to watch it since everyone has been telling me for years that I simply had to see it. Well I did and I wasn't surprised that I didn't like it. I'm sure it was an awesome thing when it came out, I can just imagine. However, I found it pretty cheesy. I cant even explain it. It was boring to me, none of the characters interested me, except Darth Vader. The one good thing this trilogy has going for it, is the score. Its truly magnificant. I really do love that aspect of it. However, the movies themselves will remain barely decent to me.
B000S0GYRU|1.0|I would buy this film if it was in its original language - that is, Italian - with (hopefully, optional) subtitles - in English to start. Since it does not, I won't buy this version of the film. Does anybody want to watch a dubbed movie anymore...?

038073186X|5.0|I just finished reading this book for my book club selection and I have to say, I couldn't put it down.  It both intrigued and amazed me.  Mr. Lehane has done a powerful job of showing us how two US Marshalls go to Shutter Island off the coast of Boston to look for an alleged escaped patient from this asylum for the crimminally insane.  Teddy, one of the marshalls is running from horror in his own life, only to find the doctors here are performing experimental and horrendous surgery on the \\"patients.\\"  But, what will grip the readers is the unexpected and quite shocking ending to this book.  It definitely is a keeper.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This film invented the Summer blockbuster, however unlike some that have followed this is a classic movie. Directed by Spielberg and with a fantastic cast, how could it go wrong? What we tend to forget now, is that Spielberg in 1975 hadn't had a blockbuster yet, so this was not a dead cert for success. However I think word of mouth and the quality of the film soon guarenteed its place in history.<br /><br />Roy Scheider is the Police Chief who's convinced there is something in the water, but is confronted by town officials only interested in not spoiling the tourist season. Scheider gives us a quietly determined man, whereas Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a grizzled fisherman, is loud, aggresive and energetic. Richard Dreyfuss completes a great trio of leading actors. The mixed chemistry between them is perhaps the strongest point in the film.<br /><br />The film won 3 Oscars, most noteably of course for John Williams evocative music score (which also won a BAFTA as well). If you weren't born in the 70's, the DVD gives you the chance to see a great film in widescreen 2.35:1 with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, which will be somewhat better than seeing the panned and scanned version frequently shown by many channels. A great film.
0061142026|2.0|When I finished reading this book, I felt that I had wasted a few hours of my life.  The characters are not developed at all.  The story barely exists.  There are so many positive reviews of this book that this will probably not affect anyone's decision, but I like virtually any good fantasy story.  This book just does not have a story or interesting characters.
B00005JPFH|1.0|I am not a Spiderman fan but have seen all 3. The second is by far the better out of all 3, and this is definetely the worst. The overblown, boring sappy story is pathetic and being the length it is, I was squirming halfway through, and I never do that. The 'enemies' were laughable, especially Sandman, who was utterly and completely pointless. Toby Maguire is so whiny in this( though that is pretty typical of him in this role). I will not even start on Kirsten Dunst. The one decent thing is the effects. But then again, I've seen it all before, so, nothing new. I would probably never watch this again.

0060763280|5.0|This book is not about how to invest in the market or any get rich quick scheme.  It is a holistic approach to how successful people think and do.  Although the topic is about having money, it first questions how you feel about having money.  The first part is quite interesting as it gives various examples of how, through conditioning, we have opinions which have been formed at an early age, about money.  There are NLP ties throughout this book.<br /><br />Then Eker introduces 17 \\"wealth files\\" which each have various strategies, illustrations and comparisons for those that earn money and those who don't.  The message is still clear that you must go and take action as nothing is going to simply fall into your lap. That being said, it begins with the mindset first.<br /><br />This book is well written, and is a fast read.  It is also equipped with many great one liner's, metaphors and stories.<br /><br />Eliot Hoppe<br />Author - Selling: Powerful New Strategies for Sales Success
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I saw \\"Inland Empire\\" last night and I am totally overwhelmed. It is brilliant, amazing, mesmerizing - you name it. I love every one of its 180 minutes and I did not want it to end. Both, \\"Eraserhead\\" and \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" pale in comparison. \\"Inland Empire\\" quotes them, references them as well as \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Twin Peaks\\" and Lynch's short films but it goes further and looks deeper. I wonder if it will be possible for Lynch to ever surpass \\"Inland Empire\\". It is his crown achievement. I watched it last night alone, in the dark, and at some point I suddenly realized that I was wired to its hellish Universe, that I was transported to Inland Empire of horrors, and I was surrounded and almost swallowed up by its infernal/internal fears, nightmares, guilt and regrets which I had to face all alone just like Laura/ Nikki/Sue did.  I am not sure if I understood the meaning of every image or every frame or every scene of the movie or even what movie I was watching every given moment, \\"Inland Empire\\" or \\"On High In Blue Tomorrows\\"? Or maybe I was watching \\"Broken dreams On High In Blue Tomorrows of Inland Empire\\"? I don't care - not everything should and can be explained. The following is the quote from the review of a Russian film critic, Marianna Shaternikova, the longtime loyal Lynch's admirer. She was not swept away by \\"Inland Empire\\" but I found her opinion of David Lynch and his world very close to what I think of him:<br /><br />\\"David Lynch possesses rich imagination and strange unusual talent. A figure of international fame and admiration, Lynch believes that life is very complicated and the movies should be equally complicated. His is the world of magic and mystery without any explanations. Very often, the plots of his movies are perplexing but Lynch would never offer any interpretation. According to him, \\"people can't accept the fact that the life, the existence has no sense, no reason. This fact makes them nervous and uncertain. Perhaps, Religion and mythology had been created as an attempt to make some sense in the existence.\\"<br /><br />It is quite obvious that \\"Inland Empire\\" would split even Lynch's devoted fans. Some of them believe that their favorite director \\"lost it\\" and indulged himself in three hours of \\"Blatant narcissism\\", \\"Self-Indulgence or \\"Self Importance\\" while the others think his latest film is a unique amazing work of a master and transfixing movie watching experience. I fail to understand why it can't be both? Does it really matter that Lynch returns over and over again to the same themes, that the same memories and images stuck with him and he has to explore them in his every work? As long as he possess his magic power and is ready to experiment with the medium, to create the brilliant, uncompromising, and even sinister films with creepy gloomy yet darkly funny atmosphere, I will be happy.een created as an attempt to make some sense in the existence.\\"     It is quite obvious that \\"Inland Empire\\" would split even Lynch's devoted fans.

B00005JMXX|3.0|I like disaster films, but they are all, for the most part predictable. This is no exception but at least its a fun ride. Its kind of long too, but I didnt mind it so much. The action is the best part in this film. I loved the helicopter scene where they all just froze. Pretty amazing effects. I'm sure this film has a message that we should all be listening to, but it was awfully ridiculously quick how everything happened, and while I'm no scientist, I cant see all that happening in a span of pretty much 1 day. Other than that, its a pretty solid made film.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Tres Hombres (1973) was ZZ Top's third album, and it's what woke everybody up to this \\"little ol' band from Texas\\". The album is full of fantastic blues-rock guitar and rough-edged songs of stoned-cosmic-cowboy mischief and misadventure.<br /><br />Tres Hombres starts out with the blues-rock workingman saga Waitin' For The Bus which crashes into Jesus Just Left Chicago, a blues account of the Messiah traveling cross-country. This 2-song medley is a ZZ Top classic that ranks right up there with the best of anything they've ever done.<br /><br />Beer Drinkers And Hell Raisers is a rousing, guitar-crunching party anthem where guitarist Billy Gibbons and bassist Dusty Hill trade off lead vocals.<br /><br />And how about that song about the best little whorehouse in Texas (\\"They gotta lotta nice girls!\\")? La Grange is classic blues-rock boogie at it's absolute best, with scorching lead guitar solos, hard driving bass, and Frank Beard's pounding drums. It's ZZ Top's signature song and nirvana for any blues-rock guitar fan.<br /><br />Master Of Sparks (a wild ride in a pickup truck) and Precious And Grace (a wild ride with two scary hitchhiking women) are both wild misadventures.<br /><br />Shiek has some cool, trippy Jimi Hendrix guitar chords, Hot Blue And Righteous is slow blues, and the last song on the original album, Have You Heard, is a rocking ZZ Top classic that includes some gutsy slide guitar work and bluesy vocal harmonies.<br /><br />This edition of Tres Hombres includes the bonus live cuts, Waitin' For The Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago and La Grange. All three are good rockin' fun.<br /><br />The remastered sound on this reissue gets a thumbs-up, and the songs all sound better than ever. If you like your blues-rock on the rough side, and want it to boogie with a blazing guitar, some Texas smoke and a few beers, you really can't go wrong with Tres Hombres.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|See the film... then buy the music and it will carry more emotional weight.  Perhaps the best film about the musical creative process in a long time.  Songs full of pathos, longing, heartbreak and hope.  Irglova's voice is magnificent, with unique phrasing and the Czech accent coming through from time to time.  Great stuff!
0385733577|5.0|OK, I read the reviews before I picked this book up and I knew I'd really enjoy this because I'm a big nerd about mythology, anthropology and religion. Michael Scott has done a fantastic job with the research and character development- I'll say that much- also, he has a brilliant imagination. This book is good for us older folks who are aching for a replacement for HP, although I definitely would NOT recommend it for younger readers- the army of the dead in the end might be a little too scary. This is not a book for a person looking for something that will encourage their religion- Mr Scott used many forms of mythology and legend as basis for this story, and if you don't like to read things that don't validate your spirituality, this is not for you. I had the feeling that Christianity was skirted around in the story so as not to offend most of America along the lines of the Da Vinci Code. If you do like religion and mythology, this is definitely one of the best novels of 2007, so far!
B000059XUO|4.0|I love the feel of this movie. It has that dark creepy feel without it being a horror movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times and each time I notice somthing different that I hadnt seen before. I know alot of guys who simply adore this film. I happen to be a girl and also love it. Its definetley a movie anybody can watch.
6305882592|5.0|'Harold and Maude' is the inspiration for all of Wes Anderson's films, from 'Bottlerocket' to 'Rushmore' on down.  His use of music in his movies is a clear homage to 'Harold and Maude.'  Hal Ashby's masterpiece has inspired viewers and creators for 36 years now.      If you don't like this movie, go to a hospital immediately!  You have a missing organ in your body called a 'heart.'  You'll need to locate it quickly.

Every American should stand up and salute Mr. Luttrell for his bravery and courage.  I could not put this book down.  It was amazing.  Having a family member who is a Green Beret (who of course thinks the Green Berets have tougher training than the Seals) I appreciate hearing about the intensive training Seals undergo.  They are one of a kind!  Thank you Mr. Luttrell for sharing this amazing experience with the rest of us who live in a sheltered society.  This book demonstrated the media is a burden during war times and endangering our troops.
B00081U6EG|4.0|In 2004 the Fender Stratocaster turned 50 and a birthday celebration was held at Wembley Arena featuring some of its greatest players. In a little over 2 1/2 hours we get many of the styles og playing that made this guitar great.    Starting with the vintage sound of The Crickets and moving through many of guitar rocks legends this was a great night. Some have complained because their favorite players were left out but the selection offered is great for a low priced disc where a percentage of sales goes to the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Organization.    Highlights include the magnificent Hank Marvin of Shadows fame playing Sleepwalk and Apache. Albert Lee taking the guitar back to its country roots with New Orleans' Theresa Andersson on Country Boy. The blistering sound of Gary Moore doing his best Hendrix on Red House. Joe Walsh took the stage with Paul Rogers  for Can't get Enough before playing his own set which included Funk 49, Life's Been Good and Rocky Mountain Way. The highlight of the evening however was Pink Floyd's David Gilmour who worked the instrument through Marooned, Coming Back to Life and Sorrow.    All in all this is a great disc for fans of the guitar whose birth it celebrates and for music itself.    The disc includes a very worthwhile interview section that runs for about 30 minutes that is well worth checking out.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|This fifth solo album from Mark covers territory that has been sorely missed out of his previous solo albums. A set list of songs primarily influenced by his life in the UK, rather than heavy doses of his always-wonderful interpretations of American music. Knopfler's songs have obviously always had Scottish, Irish, and GB influences, but this is the first, in my mind, which showcases them. Kill To Get Crimson is all at once sentimental, meditative, melancholy, and joyous. A profoundly important piece to the grand jig-saw puzzle that is Mark Knopfler's musical legacy.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you loved Pride and Prejudice, either version, I gaurantee you will love this. It's very similar with Mr. Thornton and Margaret circling each other, she doesn't like him, but is attracted to him and as she gets to know him better she comes to like him as well. I loved this movie and if you like classic English dramas, you will also love this. Plus the added bonus of a rival for Mr. Darcy for your affections. I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Thornton - and the kiss at the end is yummy!!!
B000RG1FMO|3.0|I completely agree with S. Gross \\"Chi-Town Southside's\\" review. I'm from Chicago & support everything from Chicago but the first 2 Kanye albums are much better. \\"Graduation\\" is still a good listen but not what I was expecting.
B000QQFKYE|3.0|Without telling you much about the plot, let me address new viewers who are here on this page to understand more about this DVD and whether they should buy it or not:<br /><br />1. If you're not a fan of \\"Mulholland Drive\\", don't bother. This movie is even more weird and long winded than that one, and doesn't have half the good musical score that one did.<br /><br />2. This is a three hour long esoteric experiment. If that's not your sort of thing, don't get this.<br /><br />3. Most of the movie won't make sense to you if you haven't seen anything by David Lynch. There is a thin plot, but nothing really ties in the way you might expect it to.<br /><br />4. On the flipside, if you like `weird', `cult' movies, this would be right up your alley.<br /><br />5. I personally did NOT like this 10% of how much I loved \\"Mulholland Drive\\" (my favorite English motion picture of all time). I found it meandering and pretentious in spots.<br /><br />6. I find dissection and philosophizing upon this film by `cinephiles' extremely vulgar and snotty. They often look for too much meaning just for the sake of it. If this similarly turns you off, avoid this movie.<br /><br />7. If you're looking for a weekend movie to relax to, this wouldn't be the best place to start.<br /><br />8. Laura Dern is fabulous here, even though she looks out of her element in places. She excels in most her scenes.<br /><br />9. If youre a fan of Justin Theroux, get this. This actor has been getting better and better, and outdoes himself in this movie.<br /><br />10. If you like dark, brooding cinema with an old school noir attached, this just might be the movie for you.<br /><br />I'll be the first to say it, but I found this to be the very weak and delusional half-sister of \\"Mulholland Drive\\", which I consider David Lynch's masterpiece. This movie embarrassed me and tested my patience with its over the top pretentiousness. Its as if the director was so carried away by his penchant for `hidden clues' etc, that he was throwing uselessly un-subtle twists and turns every now and then just to get the avant-garde and film-critic crowd to go `Ooh!'. In fact, much of this film is geared toward fulfilling this demographics' seven course dinner party conversations. I have no patience for this, and I think it disrespects great film-making (something Lynch used to once know how to do). Just my opinion.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Stick with \\"Mulholland Drive\\". Though watching \\"Inland Empire\\" only makes you respect that movie even more. Especially useless here was the pointless `dance' number in the end where the most personality-free group get together to belt out an inane song - all of these shenanigans worked fine on \\"Mulholland Drive\\" - here they just look tacky and out of place.<br /><br />Five Stars for Justin Theroux though.

B0002O7XWC|4.0|the movie was just about as I remembered.  I purchased it simply out of nostalgia, the extra music CD was a nice perk, and it was as entertaining as I expected it to be.  I figure I got what I paid for.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This movie was great in the theater and its great in its extended DVD version.  People whine too much about nothing.  Yes, I'd love to see a combo package with Planet Terror containing the theatrical versions with all the fake trailers too, but until it comes out I'll enjoy the extended versions.  Its not like this is the only DVD to ever come out in multiple versions (just how many versions of the LoTR sets are there?).    Kurt Russell is perfect as Stuntman Mike.  Of course, Kurt Russell is great in every movie he does.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|One of the things that is the big difference between HD and Blu Ray right now is the price of the movies.  Blu Ray movies are 50% more than normal DVDs while HD is usually around 25% more.  I think this is the only thing that's keeping the race going.  The Star trek sereies is great, no doubt, but to charge this much is absurd.  They are alienating those who might be on the hi-def fence by showing them that it's not only a hefty investment in the machines, but that they are going to get taken to the cleaners on the DVDs.  Ouch, this is just a slap in the face to not only Star Trek fans (like myself) but a great way to convince people NOT to go Hi Def.  These need to be $79 a season for me to even consider them.  I got the original DVDs for $40 a season and love them, and would love to have the new Hi-Def versions... but not at thier asking price.  Pretty sad.
0684843749|5.0|This book rocks, I have yet to really digest it but so far it has proven to be a great source of invaluable information regarding how to get in shape (even if you don't want to bulk up like Arnold!)

Sincerely,  Joel.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Just how often does one see a film that does so well in superseding all expectations. I'm sure there are many idiots in the world that will try to put this film down because to them it makes no sense. They are right. It makes no sense. This film is not for someone who looks for sense in everything. There is nothing mundane about Death Proof. In it's unpredictability and unearthly boisterous fashion, this film is overwhelming. Quentin Tarantino threatens to become my favourite director. Is it the car chase? Is it the character building? Is it the music? Is it the fact that his direction is flawless and unapologetic? Is it the heart and soul and the idea? Whatever it is, it is Death Proof.<br /><br />And yes, I have seen my fair share of films this year. Death Proof is a mux of rage, action, madness, eerieness. Kurt Russel was amazing.  I loved all the girls in the film and I liked how it seems to forward itself to the next scene and doesn't wait while you anticipate or let the film grow on you.<br /><br />One word to define this film? There isn't.  My rating - 10/10

0618680004|3.0|I'm a fan of Richard Dawkins and was looking forward to reading the book and getting a step closer to atheism instead of hedging my bets with agnosticism.<br /><br />This book doesn't bring you there. It argues sensibly that believing in God is irrational, but (at least to me) did not argue with sufficient strength that a belief in the absence of a 'God' is the rational position.<br /><br />There is at least one error in the book, where Dawkins seems to think the issues in Northern Ireland were about religion (later in the book he corrects himself somewhat). This is a common mistake. Northern Ireland's 'troubles' were about land, wealth , power - the usual things. You could draw the lines down religious lines - the Catholics were the indigenous people, the Protestants were the ruling classes having been put there by the invading British forces, but the troubles were never about religion.<br /><br />I have read a few chapters of 'God is Not Great' and I see many siimilarities. The God Delusion, at least as I read it, is more an argument that the delusion is that God might be a 'good' god rather than an uncaring cruel vindictive and generally unpleasant entity. It is also an argument that religions are inherently unstable and overall produce a negative effect on society - the Crusades, Bosnia, Northern Ireland, the current fundamentalist Islamic terror outweigh the good of charities and schooling etc.<br /><br />He makes some interesting points about how the presentation of God has changed over time. In the old testament (which is relevant to Christianity, Judaeism and Islam) God punishes descendants for 7 generations for a man's misdeeds, encouraged a man to tie his son and commit child abuse by letting the chiled believe that his father was about to fatally stab him (God likes to mess with your head) and killed off an entire planet through a global flood. Oh - this God seems to approve of women being treated as posessions, who can be raped at will.<br /><br />The Christian New Testament presents a much more forgiving, welcoming, women neutral / friendly entitiy. (Maybe God is moody!).<br /><br />This is a good read, it is certainly thought provoking, but I doubt it will convince many people to embrace atheism as the logical position. It might convince some moderately religiously inclined people that agnosticism is more rational, and that in any case, if there is a God, he/she/it really is a nasty entity unlikely to bestow eternal bliss on any of his human creations.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|In my eyes, James has yet to seize to amaze me.  The entire album is packed with songs that are filled with heart and feeling.  He has once again laid it all out there and hit a homerun.  I feel as though \\"1973\\" is one of his weakest song on the album, while \\"Carry You Home\\" and \\"I Can't Hear The Music\\" are the strongest.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Marketed as a sci-fi-action movie, \\"Next\\" was a huge box office failure. And it's a somewhat strange mix of genres. It starts out as more of a drama about a psychic, Cris (Nicolas Cage), working in Las Vegas, who meets Liz (Jessica Biel), a woman he's previously seen in visions. We're also introduced to Agent Ferris (Julianne Moore) and her team, who are looking for a missing bomb and asks Cris for help. He reluctantly helps them when he realizes Liz may be in danger.    Then the viewer is rather abruptly thrown into fast, but quite uninspired action scenes with lots of shooting. Sometimes, Cris's special gift of seeing into the future seems a bit too convenient a way for him to get out of trouble. Before long, the movie is over, and the ending is something of a letdown.    \\"Next\\" felt like a pretty short movie, and it was not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, although I wouldn't recommend it for those looking for a non-stop action movie. It's entertaining, but not without flaws.
B0009V1GC6|5.0|This is a classic & excellent album (CD)with Eric Clapton & his fellow musicians. Unconditionally recommended.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|Morally disgusting! I bought it $5 because I enjoy movies filmed in Africa and Europe. Profanity, Adultery, Fornication, Idolatry and everything immoral....  Not a family movie. The cursing and swearing starts early. The nudity and love scenes are too much. Why do they have to go to this extent to sell movies... I threw it in the trash!

B000FVQYYK|3.0|Muse is no doubt quickly becoming a sensation in the music world. They have all the elements of a band with a big professional sound. While I give full credit to Muse for all the hard work and passion they're putting into their music, if I didn't know who they were, I would swear I was listening to Radio Head. Does no one else hear the unmistakable similarities between the two bands? I'm a big Radio Head fan, and very familiar with their signature sound. While it is perfectly fine to use influences from favorite bands to help develop one's own sound, the Black Holes & Revelations album sounds like a dead ringer for Radio Head, to the point where it is uncanny, and perhaps inappropriate to call the sound their own.  Not to be indignant to Muse, but I suspect I am not the only listener who feels this may be too much of a ripoff of Radio Head. Perhaps Muse will carve out more of their own original sound with future albums.
0385522401|1.0|This was so boring that I kept skipping pages at a time - which is something I never do.  And, I have always been frustrated when a couple in love don't communicate - and this is a classic non-communication \\"love\\" story.  Very frustrating.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Let me start off by saying ima big 50 cent fan so when it came down to buying 50 or kanye i went wit 50. I listend to the album a couple of times but didnt really find myself being able to get stuck on the album like i was on his past albums. I kept on wondering if i should buy kanye's so i finally did and wow. It doesnt even compare. Kanye's beats are what really makes the album lyrically it aint the best, but i can sit for hour and just listen and reapeat practically every song. I heard kanyes other albums but this doesnt even compare. If your a kanye fan you need to get this album ,and if your a 50 fan sorry but kanye won this contest fair and square.
B000UO338W|4.0|First impressions from a lifelong fan: the Eureka Pile is back! After Paul Barker's withdrawl it seemed like the old, classic Ministry sound--great tunes with killer riffs, highly melodic, etc--was gone. This one's gonna make old fans grin from ear-to-ear--at least if they skip over tracks 2-4 (come back to them later). \\"Let's Go\\" you've already heard, but from \\"Last Sucker\\" on through to \\"End of Days\\" it's non-stop Ministry mayhem with all the trademarks tweeked, buffed, a polished to a high voltage shine. \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is amazing, but so are \\"Last Sucker,\\" \\"No Glory,\\" \\"Die in A Crash.\\" If you love the Classic Uncle Buck sound, no worries here.
B000OYC7A8|3.0|Sound is a 10 And Visual Quality is a 5. Most of the show had to many blue lights. And the smoke for 1 or 2 songs would have been fine but was use to much for most of the show. To many blue lights make the video grainy and to much smoke loses the performance on stage. The song Take A Breathe was overwhelming with to much red lights. Watching the show in person these visual effects would of been fine but filming with cameras have a hard time adjusting to these lights. More white lights and less blue lights would have produced a better video. When filming a Concert all Artists should take this into account! Watch Pink Floyd's Pulse which is a 10 for sound and video quality. I feel this is the reason it took so long for it to come out after filming because they tried to adjust and correct the video part of this concert.
B000UJ24SC|4.0|This album is frickin heavy...and still refreshing in its own way even though the metal community is majorly flooded with crap these days. I would have given this 5 stars but I'm trying to keep my voting more accurate. Get it and support these artists of the gods of metal. I dont know what that means. Just buy it punk.
B00000G3PA|5.0|In 1998, Hollywood was beginning to show interest in the impending new millennium, which led to a fascination with disaster films showcasing the end of the world, as we know it. The first film that year with this theme as its focus was the lackluster \\"Deep Impact\\" starring Morgan Freeman and Elijah Wood. This movie really failed to find much of an audience, mostly because it just wasn't all that exciting or entertaining. This was exactly the kind of reaction that Touchstone Pictures was no doubt hoping for, so that maybe their upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration called \\"Armageddon\\", starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler would find a much bigger audience, a more welcome reception, and hopefully gain huge box office success while avoiding the pitfall of its predecessor.    When meteorites bombard a team of NASA's astronauts during a space mission, resulting in NASA learning that a much bigger meteor is heading on a collision course with Earth. NASA's Executive Director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), with the authorization of the President of the United States, seeks the help of the world's most unlikely group of heroes, a team of oil drillers. This group of roughnecks, led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) is chosen to assist NASA in an ambitious endeavor to save the planet from impending doom by flying into outer space and blowing up the deadly asteroid. With time running out will these oil drillers succeed in becoming the heroes the world needs or will \\"Armageddon\\" prevail?    Where the movie \\"Deep Impact\\" failed to find an audience, Michael Bay's powerhouse action film \\"Armageddon\\" succeeded with flying colors. The impressive visuals, along with the dramatic, emotion-filled story, and talented cast of actors combined with Jerry Bruckheimer's ability to produce excellent action films, and Michael Bay's sleek sense of style and high-octane direction made this the must-see action film of the year.    The story though implausible, was verysolid and highly enjoyable. Delivering to audiences an emotionally heavy action film that didn't feel too sappy or over-dramatic. The comedic elements sprinkled throughout served as nice reprieves from the intensity of the rest of the picture. Excellently written by J.J. Abrams (\\"Alias\\" and \\"Lost\\") and Jonathan Hensleigh, \\"Armageddon\\" did a wonderful job of balancing visually stunning special effects sequences with plenty of story and character development, which no doubt served to make this one of the biggest disaster movies of all time.    The all-star ensemble cast of characters led by Bruce Willis was comprised of an impressive array of acting talent; from the veterans, Will Patton, Billy Bob Thornton, and Steve Buscemi to rising young stars Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, and Owen Wilson. Every actor made each character fun and engaging, taking full advantage of whatever screen time his or her respective characters were given no matter how small. No character felt wasted or underdeveloped, and each actor/actress was given a decent character arc to make their characters more believable and accessible to the audience.    The visual effects were some of the best I had seen at the movies up to that time. Even with the advancements made in technology used in special effects today, I still don't know if anyone else could do the disaster sequences any better than Michael Bay did in this film. Every visual effects action sequence was masterfully put together, firmly cementing Bay's place as one of the best action directors of all time.    \\"Armageddon\\" is the type of 'end-of-the-world' disaster film that \\"Deep Impact\\" wished it could have been, and others aspire to be. The movie is extremely entertaining, and features an emotionally moving story that will take you on a ride that you won't soon forget.    \\"Armageddon\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|So, `The Emancipation of Mimi' has been lauded as the return of the voice.  In fact, that is as true as it can possibly be for this album is certainly Carey's finest since `Butterfly'.  I can't say it's an exact return of the voice since her voice is a lot more breathy than her previous works, but she has definitely returned to form in that she has delivered a track listing worthy of her fame and fortune.  In fact there is not one track here that is not outstanding.  I still feel that `Butterfly' is overall her greatest album to date, but `The Emancipation of Mimi' definitely resides close behind it.  She has a great mix of hearty ballads and club worthy dance tracks and she gives her all too each and every track.  Mariah Carey had received her fair share of flak in the years proceeding `Glitter' and preceding `The Emancipation of Mimi' but here is her answer back to the legions of people claiming she had lost it all and would never get it back.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the single `It's Like That' featuring the likes of Fat Man Scoop and Jermaine Dupri.  It's not the most involving single; it's pretty much a catchy beat and Mariah setting the record straight, that no matter what anyone says she's here to stay.  It's not the best track here but it sets the stage nicely.  She keeps the same club beat mentality on finer tracks like `Get Your Number' with Jermaine Dupri, a track that shines through and through.  On `Stay The Night' Mariah's killer vocals are accompanied by a nice throwback beat that recalls the golden years of R&B while still remaining fresh and new.  In fact, `Stay The Night' may just very well be my favorite track here, but there are so many that resonate high with me it's hard to really nail down a favorite.  `To The Floor' features the talents of Nelly and they work so well together.  The beat is enticing and makes it almost impossible to remain still.  `Shake It Off' has a very bouncy vibe that makes it instantly contagious.  I will admit that radio really overdid this one, but it's still a great track.<br /><br />There are two tracks that are perfect examples of collaborations done right.  `Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg and Pharell of N.E.R.D. is one great vibin' song.  It just has the right atmosphere, the right beat, the right lyrics and the right chemistry between the artists, but if we're going to talk about killer chemistry we have to mention Mariah and Twista's collaborations.  `One And Only is superbly done with Mariah keeping the pace with the fire spitter himself.  The do this again on the bonus track `So Lonely', a track that originally appeared on Twista's album and is revisited and reworked for Mariah's deluxe album.  It works beautifully.  Mariah's voice soars here.<br /><br />`We Belong Together' is a great ballad of lost love.  Mariah's voice is top notch here, as it is in the bonus track (and international single) `Don't Forget About Us'.  In fact, it's on these ballads where Mariah has always been able to prove her weight and she does that to phenomenal heights on this album.  `Mine Again' is touching and there are moments within the chorus where her voice can give the listener chills.  `Circles' is another fantastic opportunity for Mariah to soar, and she takes that opportunity.  `I Wish You Knew' is a beautiful throwback and carries and older vibe that I adore.  `Your Girl' is one of the best songs here.  Resting nicely between ballad and pop track it allows Mariah's voice to excel while allowing Mariah to have some real fun.  It's got such a catchy vibe to it you'll be bobbing your head and singing along on no time.  `Joy Ride' is a decent track but `Fly Like A Bird' is truly outstanding.  Following the `Hero' or even `Butterfly' formula, `Fly Like A Bird' has that inspirational feel to it, and it works beautifully.  This is where the album ends, that is unless you have the deluxe copy and if that's the case then you're blessed with four additional tracks.<br /><br />I've mentioned both `Don't Forget About Us' and `So Lonely' but there is also that catchy and impressive `Makin It Last All Night' and the remix to `We Belong Together' featuring the likes of Jadakiss and Styles P.  Now I'm not a fan of remixing songs like `We Belong Together' but this one works well.  It's not my favorite track by any means, and she could have seriously done without it.  I mean, why not remix a track like `To The Floor' or `It's Like That', club happy tracks that are screaming for revised beats and additional artists?  In the end though this is not nearly enough to complain about.  Mariah has succeeded in reinventing herself and proving to the world that she still has it, never lost it and will always continue to shine.' and `So Lonely' but there is also that catchy and impressive `Makin It Last All Night' and the remix to `We Belong Together' featuring the likes of Jadakiss and Styles P.

B000HT386M|4.0|What would you do if you could pause, rewind, fast-forward (basically all of the functions you can do with a DVD player) with your life? Would you rewind through prior events to relive the glory days? Or would you skip ahead to avoid waiting in traffic or enduring a fight, or would you pause or slow-down a moment to make it seemingly last forever. Wouldn't it be nice if we had such capabilities, just imagine what fun a person could have with that kind of power. In Sony Pictures hit comedy \\"Click\\" Adam Sandler gets to experience what would happen with that power first hand, and sometimes the outcome isn't exactly what he had in mind.    \\"Click\\" is the story of Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), a man without a lot of spare time on his hands. He has a hectic, very demanding job, a boss (David Hasselhoff) who is ungrateful for everything that he does, and a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and kids that deserve more attention than he is able to give. After feeling like life is going nowhere fast for himself, Michael visits a local store and meets a very odd man (Christopher Walken) who gives him what may be the greatest gift of all time, a universal remote. The difference between this universal remote and all others is that this one can not only control electronics, but everyday life as well. Soon, Michael is using the remote to skip arguments or boring conversations, speed up certain activities, even going back through his life to relieve the good times as a younger man. However, the remote begins to go haywire and Michael finds his life spinning out of his control, and the more he tries to fix things the worse they get. Now, he must try to regain what he's lost before it's too late.    \\"Click\\" is a movie that I wanted to see from the get-go. I thought it looked funny, it featured Adam Sandler, so I knew that was a safe bet, plus it had a great supporting cast, and what appeared to be a unique story that we all could relate to (meaning all of us that would like to have this type of control over certain aspects of life). When I finally got around to seeing the movie, I must say that it wasn't all that much like I expected. Sure, it was laugh out loud funny numerous times throughout the film, but there was seriousness to the story that was unexpected, yet a welcome addition at the same time. When the remote begins to mess with Michael's life, the movie shifts gears and becomes mostly a drama, revealing the consequences of rushing through life and how eventually it will just pass you by. It's not often that an Adam Sandler movie actually features a moral or message to the story, but this one did, and it didn't feel out of place at all.    I was really surprised that for an Adam Sandler comedy, it was actually very different from his standard fare, there were his typical off-color jokes and remarks, but his character also had a sincerity to him that was uncommon for him to play. Watching him mature over the course of the film was interesting, because it forced Sandler to play more of his dramatic side rather than his slapstick side that he relies on the most. I haven't seen Adam Sandler's more serious movies \\"Reign Over Me\\" and \\"Punch Drunk Love\\", so I wasn't too sure how all of the serious elements were going to end up playing out when I saw that was definitely where the story was heading, but he handled it remarkably well. The rest of the cast was a mixture of sweet and caring (Michael's wife and kids), to somewhat strange (Michael's parents), to downright kooky and possibly on the verge of insanity (Christopher Walken's character). Each actor/actress was equally entertaining, and delivered very fun, interesting characters that were always enjoyable when on the screen. My favorite supportive character had to have been Chris Walken's, and I was happy that the writers gave him more than just a cameo of screen time. I believe he literally stole every scene he was in, and he did it so effortlessly, which is how it should be done.    If you are a fan of Adam Sandler movies you should enjoy \\"Click\\", it does start out kind of slow, but after 10 minutes or so it really picks up, but there is some seriousness to it as well, so don't just expect to be laughing the entire time. But if you're not a fan of Sandler's films, and I know there are plenty of you out there, this is definitely one of his movies that I think you should see. It's a different type of Adam Sandler comedy, one with much more depth and originality than most of his efforts. Though not my favorite Adam Sandler movie, it definitely ranks up there around the top with \\"Big Daddy\\" and \\"The Longest Yard\\".    \\"Click\\" is rated PG-13 for language and sensuality.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|`Alice in Wonderland' is a story about nonsense.  It makes this very clear within the first few moments.  Alice wants her world to be filled with nonsense, talking flowers and cats, nothing is what it is, what's that is this and what's this is that.  Knowing this makes following and appreciating `Alice in Wonderland' possible because it really has no clue as to which direction it's going.  Nothing really fits together, there's no rhyme and or reason to the sequences of events, to the disorder within Alice's world, and if the audience isn't aware of the concept behind this cartoon they may find themselves a little turned off.  I find this one of the most fascinating of Walt Disney's cartoons just because of the sheer magnitude of its cascade of creations.  Everything within Alice's world is intriguing and interesting and color (literally and figuratively) and it provides one fun, spellbinding good time.<br /><br />Alice gets her world of nonsense when she spots a white rabbit with a clock complaining about being late for something.  She, out of pure curiosity, follows him into a world unlike any she's ever known.  From the moment she crawls into the rabbit hole till she escapes the clutches of the evil Queen of Hearts the story is just about all over the place.  Alice meets a slew of interesting characters, legendary in the world of Disney.  She meets Tweedledee and Tweedledum who tell her the cautionary tale of the Walrus and the Carpenter in a warning of her growing curiosity.  She meets the Cheshire Cat who leads her in directions unbecoming.  She meets the singing flowers of the field who mistake her for a weed and the strange Caterpillar who smokes himself into a butterfly.  She comes across the Mad Hatter and March Hare who are busy celebrating their un-birthdays to help Alice find her rabbit.  And then of course we have the Queen of Hearts and the ultimate showdown between her and Alice.<br /><br />With everything that goes on in `Alice in Wonderland' I'm tempted to say there really is no moral, which is usually consistent with Walt Disney films.  If there is a moral it's that we all need a little order in our lives, but even that could be a stretch.  In fact, `Alice in Wonderland' is really nothing more than good fun.  It's entertaining to everyone, even myself, and it's sure to be a favorite amongst the little ones.  It's the first cartoon I bought for my daughter and I hope as she gets older it becomes one of her favorites.  I have yet to read the novels by Lewis Carroll but from what I hear this cartoon adaptation is a good comparison, which may explain for it's strangeness to a degree.  This is actually based on two of his novels, `Alice in Wonderland' & `Through the Looking Glass'.  I'm anxious to know what a modern adaptation would look like.  Until that day we have this classic masterpiece to watch and rewatch again and again.really is no moral, which is usually consistent with Walt Disney films.

B000055Y0Y|5.0|Eastwood and Malkovic are favorites - but more importantly, I purchased this video as nostalgia - the house on which Eastwood is holding on to Malkovic so he won't fall was owned by my husband's parents and is the home in which he and his bros grew up.  It is just a flash but it is recognizable to us.  It is now a B&B and classed as \\"historic\\".  So thanks for the memories.
0679736646|4.0|The first comparison that came to mind when I started reading \\"Ubik\\" was Don DeLilo's \\"[[ASIN:0140283307 White Noise (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)]].\\"  Not due to any special thematic comparison, but because of the advertisements for great new products named Ubik at the beginning of each paragraph in the story; this reminded me of the constant low-level onslaught of information that came at you while reading \\"White Noise.\\"<br /><br />As far as the story itself - what can one say without spoiling it?  The main character is Joe Chip, a tester for the Runciter Group, which is a group of \\"Anti-psis\\" - basically, they null out psionic power to help protect people's privacy.  I was by stages amused and appalled by the vision of 1992 painted in this novel - apparently we were supposed to have made our way to Mars and the Moon by now, with colonies on each, and we're supposed to be dressing even more outlandishly than we do now.  However, it seems odd to me, as I have been reading through the omnibus in which this story resides ([[ASIN:0739426141 Counterfeit Unrealities (contains Ubik, A Scanner Darkly, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep [aka Blade Runner], The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch)]]) to note the things that are kept in the 50s and 60s.  Women are either young and in the service industry or they are matrons and stay at home.  If they are other than that, then they are shown as . . . strange, even dangerous, such as Pat Conroy in this story.  It is this that makes her such an appropriate foil for Joe Chip, as he stumbles through his attempts to keep the group together after a major fiasco occurs when the Glen Runciter - the owner of the company - takes a group of his most highly skilled workers to the Lunar colony for a job and is there attacked.<br /><br />The rest of the story shakes down while the surviving characters notice a strange combination of entropy and growth - recession and coming into being.  The world seems to be regressing to an older era, but at the same time, they keep getting messages from \\"beyond\\" instructing them on what to do.  Then the question arises - who is really dead?  Who is really alive?  What is reality?  Who is creating it?<br /><br />Not for a light evening's read, that's for sure!  But well worth the slodge if you have the time.  Most intriguing and something to keep the ol' cerebellum stretched.  Give it a try.he same time, they keep getting messages from \\"beyond\\" instructing them on what to do.

B00005QENZ|5.0|Aerosmith enjoys popularity these days decades after they formed their band. Their rock sounds are classic and catchy at the same time; and their rock ballads move me very much. This CD, entitled Get A Grip, gives us Aerosmith at their very best.<br /><br />\\"Eat The Rich\\" gets some of its power by switching back and forth rapidly from major and minor keys; the electric guitars also make this number special. Love that percussion--Steve Tyler and Joe Perry sing like no other duo! The underlying beat from the drums and percussion work to make this a song that rocks hard; and Aerosmith lets people rail against the rich to express their anger that some people are \\"more equal that other\\" simply because they are wealthy. Great! \\"Get A Grip\\" also uses drums and percussion for the underlying main beat of this number; and the use of major and minor chords in \\"Get A Grip\\" proves to be a strong tactic to make this \\"Get A Grip\\" rock hard! You will like \\"Get A Grip\\" very much!<br /><br />\\"Livin' On The Edge\\" gives us a beautiful rock ballad by this stellar band; Aerosmith cries out against everything bad in this world. The electric guitars work to bolster this number; and Steven Tyler sings this flawlessly with Joe Perry helping him well. Great! Good chorus, too. \\"Cryin'\\" rocks hard but remains squarely in the realm of rock ballad; Steven Tyler sings of how he was sad without a true love before he met his girlfriend; but now that she's gone he's equally sad once again. \\"Cryin'\\" uses the drums and percussion very well; and those classic chord and tempo changes make this a beautiful rock ballad. \\"Cryin'\\" is worth the price of admission all on its own!<br /><br />\\"Amazing\\" recalls Steven Tyler's true story of how he used drugs that didn't help him at all even though at the time he thought they were making his life less painful. This passionate ballad moves me with its beauty; and Steven sings with without a superfluous note! The band back him up flawlessly; \\"Amazing\\" is easily a highlight of this album; and I believe that it's one of their best songs ever as well. I especially like the way Aerosmith uses the strings to lift this number even higher; and the band jams like they never did before on \\"Amazing.\\"<br /><br />The CD track set ends with the instrumental \\"Boogie Night.\\" The electric guitars start playing softly and then as they get louder \\"Boogie Man\\" takes off like a jet! Good bass from Tom Hamilton, too.<br /><br />The liner notes include great artwork and we also get the lyrics to all the songs on this CD. Awesome!<br /><br />Aerosmith scored a major coup with Get A Grip; and if we're lucky they'll never stop!<br /><br />Rock on, Aerosmith!d I believe that it's one of their best songs ever as well.

B00005QEO1|5.0|Aerosmith made several excellent CDs along the way; and they still go strong with plenty of life left in them! This CD by Aerosmith, Pump, gives us an excellent collection of more instantly classic rock tunes and ballads by these masters of rock and roll.<br /><br />The CD track set begins with \\"Young Lust.\\" The electric guitars work well to start off the number-- and the CD--just right. Steven Tyler cries out and then starts singing about the lust we all experience when we're young and spend time with someone we find really, really hot. The drums, percussion and guitars make a great musical arrangement that lets \\"Young Lust\\" take off like a jet! \\"F.I.N.E.*\\" rocks hard; the band performs this excellent number about how excited a young man is to spend time alone with his girlfriend. Great! Good subtle changes between major and minor chords, too.<br /><br />\\"Love In An Elevator\\" starts with a few spoken lines to set the tone for this ballad about love, lust and romantic attraction between man and woman. Aerosmith compares love in an elevator to making love; the electric guitars, drums, percussion and bass work wonders for the arrangement. Steven Tyler and Joe Perry sing \\"Love In An Elevator\\" like the pros that they are! The band jams hard, too. Great! \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\" begins with an eerie sounding intro that has some awesome minor chords; Aerosmith sings of a woman who's been so abused by her father that she wants to use a gun to kill him. The drums make \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\" even better; and Aerosmith does this ballad to perfection. The chorus is very well done; and the band jams, too. I predict that you will like \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\" very much.<br /><br />\\"Don't Get Mad, Get Even\\" explores the hatred a person can feel for another after they've been wronged. Steven Tyler sings of a man who wants to \\"get even\\" with the person who hurt him without losing control of himself. The guitars work wonders for \\"Don't Get Mad, Get Even.\\" This rock number also lets Steven Tyler show of his wide vocal range--awesome!<br /><br />The final track is entitled \\"What It Takes.\\" This instant classic rock ballad explores the pain a man feels when he sees his former girlfriend with another man. He reminisces about their love and wonders what he could have done to keep their love alive. Steven Tyler delivers this passionately with all his heart and soul; and Joe Perry helps out on vocals, too. The harmonica adds a nice touch to the musical arrangement as the guitars rock hard with great percussion. \\"What It takes\\" provides a strong ending for this incredible album.<br /><br />The liner notes include some fantastic artwork as well as the song credits.<br /><br />Aerosmith put out many albums--and here's hoping they will continue to do so for many years to come! Nevertheless, Pump glistens like shiny gold amongst all their CDs. I highly recommend this as a \\"must-have\\" for Aerosmith fans; and people who enjoy classic rock will cling on to this album for ages to come!<br /><br />Rock on, guys!

1591841666|3.0|I also felt this read more like a very long magazine article or blog entry and felt that Seth Godin avoided the central crucial issue -- HOW to decide whether to push on when you are in a dip and when to decide to quit that activity.    About the only thing I did get was the concept that one should NOT make that decision in the heat of the moment, the analogy used is don't decide whether to continue on in the marathon at mile 20.  Decide before you begin what circumstances will cause you to quit if you experience them at mile 20 -- you know like, \\"If I can't proceed on two feet, but am crawling by mile 20, then I'll quit.\\"  or \\"if I'm having double vision at mile 20, then I'll quit.\\"  And be specific, don't say \\"If I'm really feeling lousy I'll quit at mile 20.\\"      So yes, I got something out of this book -- the idea to decide on an exit strategy upfront.  Good advice.  But not worth a book, book tour, etc.  For my next trip to bookstore, I plan to check out \\"Free Prize Inside, How to Create a Purple Cow\\"  Or maybe since several reviewers mentionned 4 Hour Work Week, maybe I'll try that.    And to the reviewer who said don't buy it unless you can get it for 1 cent at a garage sale.  That's a little harsh.  I think I'd go up to 99 cents.
0517147688|4.0|I bought this book for a good friend and she went bonkers when she saw it. I did too when I opened the box the day it came in the mail. I wanted to keep it for myself! The cover is beautiful, the pages are gold edged, and it is just a wonderful book!
B000EOTAM6|4.0|In the early twenty-first century, a deadly virus had wiped out 99% of the earth's population. Now, four hundred years later, all of humanity lives in a walled-in city named Bregna and are led and monitored by a group of scientists. But not all are happy with this arrangement and a rebel group called Monicans have risen to oppose those in charge.<br /><br />And Aeon is one of them.<br /><br />At first glance, the main story of this movie is like many others that have come before: a small band of rebels going up against an oppressive government. But this movie isn't that simple and the aforementioned plot is just what gets us from Point A to B. There are other factors that play into the story, complicated ones, taking what could have just been a B-sci-fi movie all the way to A-level.<br /><br />Charlize Theron stars as Aeon, the Monicans' cold, stick-to-business top assassin. The intensity she brings to the role drags you in and makes you want to discover what makes her tick. Yet she also has a warm side, but one hidden and numbed by years of training and running top secret errands for her team. Theron put on a wonderful show in the lead.<br /><br />The supporting cast, though they all did a good job and their characters were believable, were just that: a supporting cast. No one's performance really stood out except maybe Sophie Okonedo as Sithandra (the girl with the hands for feet). She was just plain cold (in that good way).<br /><br />The special effects are astonishing. There is not a single element in this film that is \\"everyday.\\" Everything was built for it, whether physically or via CGI. The action is astounding, part Matrix and part Underworld.<br /><br />Action and sci-fi fans should really get into this movie.<br /><br />A.P. Fuchs

B000R7HY0K|4.0|A lot of the reviews here seem to be people upset at the split on DVD. I'm gonna give my best at reviewing the movie and ignoring the split on DVD.<br /><br />As stated before Death Proof is one half of Grindhouse, which was split upon the DVD release. It's a throwback to 70s exploitation flicks. Death Proof has sparked a pretty big debate among viewers; some love it and hail as a masterpiece others find it slow and boring and a waste of time.<br /><br />As a fan of exploitation cinema I personally wouldn't put Death Proof with that genre of film. While Death Proof is paying homage to those styles of films it really doesn't feel like one. About the only thing that makes it feel like a 70s exploitation flick is the look of the movie at least in the first half. The lines going through the picture the picture jumps. I really enjoyed that in the first half.<br /><br />A lot of those movies do indeed look like that well before they are restored onto DVD so in that sense Tarantino really captures that vibe, but just not with the actual movie. As for the movie itself I thought it was excellent. I'll admit thus far I have enjoyed everything Quentin Tarantino has done so I was quite pumped for Death Proof.<br /><br />As good as a director Quentin is what really makes him stand-out is his dialogue. I think even the biggest of Quentin Tarantino fans will agree while he is a talented director; he's a much better writer.<br /><br />Death Proof is your typical Quentin Tarantino movie with the great writing he is known for among his fans. Though with that said I do believe there were some problems. I loved the first half of the movie; in my opinion it was some of Tarantino's best writing of his career. Sure it's no Pulp Fiction, but I found it well-written and damn entertaining.<br /><br />The characters were well-written and again your typical Tarantino characters. But the 2nd half changes focus on the characters and that's when things get a tad bit messy.<br /><br />The biggest complaint with Death Proof was it was too slow and too much talking. I personally never once in the first half found it slow or boring. The writing was sharp and I found the tension building. We know something was gonna happen sooner or later and the anticipation of that I felt worked amazingly.<br /><br />But the 2nd half is when I did start to find things slowing down and I didn't feel that tension. Honestly, the 2nd half felt like somebody trying to be Quentin Tarantino. I never found Death Proof boring, but I have to admit I wasn't into the 2nd half nearly as much as I was the first half.<br /><br />The characters just in my opinion didn't work as well and again I personally felt as if the 2nd half was written by someone trying to copy Tarantino. The 2nd half is by no means bad; it just doesn't work quite as well and in some areas does drag a bit. It doesn't take a way from the fun of the movie though.<br /><br />The car chase scenes at the end were excellent and that is something we don't see much of today in film. And when we do normally its CGI and even when it's not CG when we do get it I don't know I just find it doesn't work.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to film the guy is pretty much a walking encyclopedia of knowledge when it comes to movies. So not much of a surprise the car chase scenes cam out as wonderful as they did; the scenes were suspenseful and action packed and very much made up for some of the slower spots in the 2nd half.<br /><br />The cast was great here. The girls are all very sexy and excellent and Rose McGowan pretty much steals the show from them. But the real stand-out of the movie is Kurt Russell.I have always been a fan of Kurt Russell and this was his best role in years. He's played a couple of Iconic characters and I think Stuntman Mike is another one to his list.<br /><br />I would very much recommend this flick to fans of Tarantino; if you like his work thus far odds are you'll really dig Death Proof. But for those who aren't fans of QT I doubt this movie will change your opinion of him.<br /><br />Death Proof is a well acted and made movie that has plenty of thrilling and very fun moments. While it doesn't really capture the 70s exploitation vibe Death Proof is a must see.f is a well acted and made movie that has plenty of thrilling and very fun moments.

B000SM7QUC|3.0|Musically, this album is amazing. The orchestrations are reminiscent of Queensrÿche and contain lyrical poetry reminiscent of Leonard Cohen. That's the problem. It's so heavy you just can't listen to it more than a couple of times without wanting to end your own life.     There are no catchy hooks in these songs which is disappointing because he's written such good stuff in the past. Don't expect to hear any of these morbid ditties on the radio.    Now I have to go do something lighthearted like watch Sid & Nancy.
038572179X|5.0|And I read a LOT of books.     At turns I found myself audibly gasping, laughing, and crying.    This is an amazing read full of deeply realized characters whose internal dialogue captures what it is to be a human being.     Yep. I've just decided: \\"Atonement\\" is definately the best book I've ever read.

B000RG1FMO|1.0|Kanye needs to become a better rapper and producer. Most of the songs in this album are sampled off of other artist songs. Look at Strong and Drunk Hot Girls, Im getting images of Gold Digger all over again! His rapping skills are also horrible.   Save your money and don't buy this album.

Highly recommended.
B0000024K1|5.0|WOW where do I start I remember I was chillin in my cousin back yard the first time I heard this album,it was in the afternoon and the sun was just coming out.I hear this beat with a whistle and this guy start ryhmin I swear it sent shock waves through me (BOUGHT ALBUM A HOUR LATER).I want to first say that I love music but hip hop took me where I needed to be because it was more than just music it was a culture.The lengendary group public enemy was the essence of hip hop because their music was about rebellion and not from your parent's or the people who love or anything like that but against destructive outside forces.The icon's also represented self awareness and being who you are to get the most out of life.The simularities to marvin gaye and the last poets are that of having music that is still able to relate to today's issue's.The difference is and this is no disrespect to those legendary artist,Public Enemy is able to take advantage Hip Hop which has more element's than any other music created and less rule's.The only rule's are is that you you have to be original, Funky and that it come's from the soul, but in R&B and Poetry your in a box in a sense,but hip hop if consist of all the elements I just stated the artist or group is able to reach a broader fan base, touch the masses so to speak.I would like to describe Public Enemy's for those who's been living under a rock,Public Enemy's music is political ,human, and a high entertainment element.(As I said before it send's shock wave that causes a rush I can't explain to this day.The era I come from is an era when we thought for ourselves and that was the very essence of HIP HOP SELF EMPOWERMENT, SELF AWARENESS,SEE THE WORLD THROUGH YOUR OWN EYE'S.THAT ERA OF HIP HOP MUSIC WAS LEGENDARY AND IT's MUSIC THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET AS LONG AS I LIVE. THANK YOU CHUCK, FLAV , GRIFF, TERMINATOR X , S1W'S, AND CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THIS ALBUM TOUCH MY SOUL.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|This is a great series, made all the better by Michael C. Hall as the eponymous anti-hero. Without him, the series might have floundered; a lesser actor may not have walked the delicate tightrope between murderous and magnanimous with the same masterful balance. The series is well written, with a very cleverly conceived title sequence, but it truly is the reliable performances which make this show. Highly recommended (especially for those who love themselves a bit of Michael C. Hall).

B00006JQU1|5.0|Unlike many period violin recordings, this one is able to provide a warm, not-scratchy sound even when doing complex multiple stops, and gives you something like the best of both worlds - the bigger dimensions you get from modernised instruments, along with the intimacy of gut strings. Podger's techincal skills are flawless, and though I wouldn't always agree with all her decisions (e.g. how she interprets some of the chords in the central section of the G-minor fugue), her recordings are nevertheless wonderful. I used to prefer Grumiaux (see my review of that for more about the music itself), and it's hard to choose between the two, but I think Podger's my new favourite.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|The fact that this incarnation of the band consists of only two of the original band members, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin, and that the album is as good as it is serves as evidence as to how much the identity of Smashing Pumpkins is encompassed by Billy Corgan as a musician and songwriter. The title 'Zeitgeist,' or 'Spirit of the Age' in German seems quite appropriate as there's definitely a heavy-metallic element in the consistent combination of rapid chord changes and heavy distortion in the tracks - I got a sense that there was a concerted effort to resurrect the Pumpkins with as much ferocity as Corgan and Chamberlin could muster. I would actually classify this as Smashing Pumpkins' hardest album to date, as the mixdown possesses a certain muddiness to it that struck me as being heavier than the psychedelic grunginess of Siamese Dream.     Of particular interest to me were the chord changes and how they were arranged. The arrangments of the first two tracks in particular, 'Doomsday Clock' and '7 shades of black' sounded almost Flamenco-like in melody, like Fernando Sor as interpreted by Rage Against the Machine. This continues, though in more subtle form, in 'Tarantula' and 'United States.' Constant throughout the album is Jimmy Chamberlin's superb drumming, showing once again that he's one of the best rock drummers out there bar none.     Unfortunately, its the very ferocity of the album that prevents it from being as great as it could have been - it almost rocks too much. There are some excellent gems in Zeitgeist, but the general heaviness of it left me with an impression of slight monotony, a bit of a one-dimensionality that I know, as a long-time Pumpkins fan, is out of place compared to the more eclectic MellonCollie or even Adore (the latter of which I believe to be a severely underrated album). Some of the later tracks in Zeitgeist had some pretty interesting keyboard work by Corgan that almost reminded me of 'Scary Monters' era David Bowie, but Ifelt that Corgan didn't explore that angle thoroughly enough. It also left me wondering if James Iha's predilection for tender ballads had infleunced the band's earlier efforts more that I previously gave it credit for.    Overall, if you're a fan of the Pumpkins, Zeitgeist is worth listening to, but I would have to place it as a weaker entry in their discography. Its solid enough, however, to leave me anticipating their future releases.
B000OY8NII|4.0|It's not like any show on TV and that's saying a lot. Like another reader wrote, it's \\"quirky\\".    I haven't seen every episode of Season One but I'm looking forward to it. I already have it in the shopping cart to purchase. I love the comedic timing of Colin Ferguson as Sheriff Carter and isn't Jordan Hinson (his daughter Zoe) a ringer for Rachael Leigh Cook??? It's also great to see Salli Richardson and Joe Morton on the show too... it's really very cleverly written, funny, intelligent and gives the sci-fi lover in me a boost. As one of the characters say in a season two episode, \\"God's gone to Eureka! Hallelujah!\\" ;)    Oh and I only gave it four starts because I've not seen all the episodes ...yet. I'm pretty sure it deserves five stars though.    Eureka's a cool place t'be... I wanna go... sign me up.

It has everything a Bond movie is supposed to have, with Sean Bean thrown in there as a bonus!<br />Pierce Brosnan is perfectly suave, pithy, and tough in this, his first role as double 0 agent James Bond.<br />This, and Casino Royale are, in my opinion, the best Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me.

B00005JLRT|4.0|It took me 5 years to see this movie, and I saw it on DVD. What can I say? I just don't get into theaters much.<br /><br />I thought about this movie awhile before writing this review. I can easily capsulize those feelings by creating two \\"Alternate Titles:\\"<br /><br />1.) Attack of the Clones<br />2.) The Picard and Data Show.<br /><br />Both Picard and Data had \\"evil clones\\" that were involved in a plot that could destroy the Earth. The rest of the Enterprise crew played bit parts, in comparison.<br /><br />I liked their stories, and the way they came together. I like the inevitable \\"death\\" of a major character. (Reminds me of Spock's \\"Death.\\")<br /><br />I continue to be totally disappointed with Worf's performance. This guy is a Klingnon, and supposedly one of the stronger crew members. But I swear he's lost every fight he's been involved in. It was so pitiful to see Worf whining about the after-effects of Romulan wine, and about the upcoming nude wedding for Counsellor Troi and Will Riker.<br /><br />Just once I'd like to see Worf get involved in a fight, and beat the ever-loving tar out of someone. Ok... beat him up, but don't kill the enemy.<br /><br />I've loved all the Star Trek TV shows, even when I missed a few over the years. I love watching the Star Trek movies. I go more for the way they reach me, emotionally.<br /><br />\\"Nemesis\\" reached me, thrilled me, and also disappointed me a bit.<br /><br />I have an idea this may have been the last Star Trek movie. And I waited 5 years to say goodbye.
B00005B1W5|4.0|The first time I saw and heard Yanni was on the PBS broadcast of Live at the Acropolis, and I was hooked.  My wife insisted I get the CD. It is still her favorite CD.    Lost touch for some years, and didn't know that Yanni's concert at the Taj Mahal was available.      Finally got the Concert Event on DVD and the whole magic of his music was back again.  Pedro Eustache (Duduk, flutes..  is there anything this guy cannot do?) and Samvel Yervinyan (violin) are the super talented musicians who helped Yanni create probably his best music concert.  I only wish I could have seen the actual concert.    On Amazon, I finally checked out and got Yanni's Tribute DVD. This is terrific.... I simply love Nightingale.   Having all three of Yanni;s DVDs, I think his Concert Event is the best.    I agree with another reviewer, however, that the Concert Event and other DVDs are most enjoyable on the DVD, but if you just want to LISTEN, then Yanni's CDs like Reflections of Passions, etc are the way to go.  The DVDs have more showmanship and the individual musicians are a joy to watch when they play their magic.  Love Yanni for bringing us this great music.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is truly an amazing and enchanting show. The characters that inhabited Stars Hollow were truly special and unique. The well written dialogue and monologues were amazingly said and acted. Only the Gilmore Girls could launch into their monologues with so much intensity. The witty talk and banter was really another character in the show. Words had their own personality and place in the world of Stars Hollow.<br /><br />All the seasons were excellent, except when Lorelai and Rory stopped talking. I was truly hurting for them. How can you have the Gilmore girls if they don't talk to each other. That aside, all the seasons were excellent.<br /><br />The seventh season was good (except when Chris entered the picture). I was disappointed with what they did to Chris' character. He turned into a jealous (although there was reason for this), immature man-child who failed to support Lorelai when she needed him the most. Luke had kept the secret about his daughter in Season 6 (after launching into a monologue directed at Lorelai about how secrets...hypocrite much?!). Lorelai, who had been a strong woman, flawed but strong, became this even more flawed character that cheated on Luke after he failed to accept her ultimatum to elope in Season 6. She moved away from the Lorelai we knew and loved. Season 6 was a very contentious season and it was a challenge to fix things on Season 7.<br /><br />Although this season was not as good as the previous ones, after all, it was missing the Sherman-Palladino team...it did well. But, the show no longer had the amazing witty banter that characterized the show, what actually made it what it was. I appreciate that they ended the show now, rather than continuing without the Sherman-Palladino team. It would have degraded episode by episode.<br /><br />Still, there were great moments and episodes in Season 7. I loved every moment where Lorelai and Luke talked. When Lorelai sang at karaoke night, \\"I will always love you\\" (directed at Luke), I screamed with delight...It was one of the best moments of the entire show.<br /><br />The show had a good series finale. Luke became Lorelai's hero once again, not that he ever stopped being it, and organized Rory's farewell party.<br /><br />What a truly amazing series. The cast was one of a kind. Lauren Graham did a phenomenal job and so did Melissa McCarthy.

1563898586|3.0|This is an okay graphic novel. It has some interesting story elements and characters but the story never really engaged me. Not a bad read, but clearly not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is not a clear fan of comic books.
0823016714|5.0|I just recently started creating a webcomic and I never could have done it without this book. The expressions range from highly exaggerated to more subtle and, I promise you, will work for almost any expression you want to create. Also, many expressions are shot at multiple angles, making it much easier for me to create the exact image I am thinking of. Perfect.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Kurt Russel is awesome in Death Proof as Stunt-Man Mike, a loser who stalks and kills women with his stunt car. He sure knows how to ditch it out but when some crazy stunt chicks fight back...can he handle it ?<br /><br />  Besides Russel being in great form and the girls being hot, the car chase at the end is great too. But I'm not sure all the talk is needed. The first bunch of girls just talk about guys and sex and then the 2nd batch come along and talk about the same stuff basically. So I don't think it was that needed since all we really needed to know about the 2nd batch is that they don't take crap and that they are pretty wild.<br /><br />  While Stunt-Man Mike might or might not really have done stunts in tv shows since no one has even seen his work. He might just be a wannabe who borrowed his stunt-man brother's car, that's my theory anyway lol. With all the talking we do get some new classic Tarantino lines I admit but most of those I think are in the bar scene when we first meet Stunt-man Mike. Although before the action at the end we do get a brutal scene where we see how dangerous Stunt-man Mike and his car really are. Well that is if he is the one ditching it out. When he's getting it back Russel is hilarious and brilliant how he plays it off which to me is why he should be nominated most of all.
0316168815|4.0|After fourteen year old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered, she goes to heaven where she is able to look down at her family and friends and the rest of the world. As she is adjusting to life in heaven and making friends there, she is also watching her family deal with her disappearance. She watches as both her parents struggle to accept the fact that she is gone and the affect it has on their marriage; she watches her younger sister Lindsay grow and become stronger as a person; and she watches her little brother Buckley, who is too young to understand what is going on. She also watches her friends Ray Singh and Ruth Connors, as they grow closer after Susie's death. As Susie watches her family and friends grow older and mature, she begins to realize how much she has lost and longs for one more chance for life on earth.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a sad, moving, and at times odd novel. Extremely well written by Alice Sebold, it is told in the first person by Susie. This unique perspective means that we not only have insight into what Susie was like as a person, but who her killer was and how frustrating it is for her to not only watch the killer stalk other victims (including someone close to Susie) but watch the police try and find her body and determine who her killer is and prove it. Her ability to look down from heaven to see her family and others (and somehow be privy to their thoughts) adds poignancy to the novel, as each of her family members and friends struggle to cope with their loss in their own private ways. It is heartbreaking to read about how Susie's disappearance and the inability of the police to find her body affects her parents marriage, and how Susie begins to realize she didn't know them, especially her mother, all that well. It's equally heartbreaking to see Susie watch her sister Lindsay grow up and experience things that Susie never will, especially falling in love and having sex for the first time. Sebold makes the characters so believable that at times I wanted to hug them and say \\"I'm sorry\\" and at other times I wanted to shake them and make them aware of how their actions were hurting others. Although the book is sad, it's not as depressing as I thought it would be and there are some humorous moments in the book, mostly with Susie's Grandma Lynn. While I thought \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was well written for the most part, there was a truly odd section towards the end that felt out of place in the book.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a moving novel about love and loss.t times I wanted to hug them and say \\"I'm sorry\\" and at other times I wanted to shake them and make them aware of how their actions were hurting others.

B000VECAEO|5.0|For years, nothing could beat Seinfeld in funny.  Then we get shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm or BBC's The Office.  Seinfeld, however, stands apart as one of the greatest sitcom's ever created.  It broke the mold and refused to follow the comedic forumula previously established by other lesser shows.  Season 9 is one of my favorite seasons, the majority of it's episodes are on my favorite episode list.  Far from declining after David's departure, it surpassed itself and my expectations in continually leaving me rolling on my living room floor each Thursday night.

B000B5XOXY|4.0|Not as brooding as the first Batman and not nearly as dark and disgusting as the second (I'm thinking here of Penguin's constant sliming-at-the-mouth) but this is a pretty solid entry into the series.  While the brooding Batman worked great in the first one, sequels are not required to remake their predecessors.  Taken on its own merit, Batman Forever works very well as a fun (yes, a little bit campy) adventure into this comic-book-movie franchise.  With this one, they wanted to distance themselves from the very dark atmosphere of the second movie and it works for them.  There's nothing wrong with a little camp in a movie that is meant to be this visual. (They unfortunately went way overboard with the complete sillyness of Batman & Robin.)<br /><br />Kilmer works well in the bat suit but it's not necessarily that hard since almost everyone looks the same when all you can see is their chin and the suit only allows a certain range of movement. His Bruce Wayne doesn't seem quite as charming as Keaton's, though, but that's okay.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones obviously enjoys his role here.  It's just a pitty that he doesn't get more to do since the movie favors Carey's Riddler character. Two Face, the established villain, ends up playing second fiddle to this new-comer screwball.<br /><br />All in all, though, it's an enjoyable film as long as you don't expect a retread of the ground covered in the first two.
0743277457|5.0|What a relief to read a book on peak performance that is not solely about a business or sports leader.  For me, those books seem to follow a cookie-cutter approach and in many ways do not speak to our day-to-day living.  What is unique about Waitzkin's book is that it leaves you with practical approaches that you can apply to any aspect of your performance.  He also convincingly explains how you can be more alive to, aware of and appreciative of everyday, \\"routine\\" living.  He achieves this by telling the story of his childhood chess prodigy, from his initial interest in the game at Washington Square Park to his eventual rise to national and international championships.  Waitzkin genuinely comes across as a supremely gifted chess player without the usual arrogance that is found in some child prodigies.  His persona thus allows you to be more open to his suggestions and philosophies.    Waitzkin shares his trial and tribulations not only in the world of competitive chess but also in the accompanying celebrity from his \\"chessic\\" successes and from his portrayal in the film, [[ASIN:6305910340 Searching for Bobby Fischer]], based on his father's book by the same name.  He goes deeply and instructively into his own psychology, sharing with the reader a valuable perspective on how he grew through his chess experiences.    After conquering the world of chess, Waitzkin moved on to the martial arts, especifically Tai Chi.  He weaves together his chess experience with his Tai Chi development, which eventually led to his winning the international championship.  Throughout the recounting of this journey, he relates the various techniques and mental insights he learned that helped him achieve his goals.  He gives these teachings various names - Making Smaller Circles, Slowing Down Time, etc.- and demonstrates how they can be applied to everyday living. My only disappointment was that these major lessons are not summarized anywhere.  They are weaved in and reinforced throughout the book, which is good, but a summary table or chapter would have been useful.    Waitzkin is a terrific writer and his storytelling ability keeps the reader fully engaged in the various dramas.    Finally, in some ways, the book is a parenting book, as Waitzkin describes the way his parents related to him during his life of chess, allowing him to be a child, while encouraging him to follow his passion in a field that often turned children into ogres.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing too complex to be found but even simple arrangments can sound good if done right.
B00001OH7G|5.0|Before buying Rory's \\"Irish Tour\\" album, I only knew a couple studio songs such as \\"For the Last Time\\" and \\"Just the Smile\\".    Let me say this- I don't know much about playing the guitar.  I never got the urge to learn the instrument, and I just figured it would be more exciting to listen to OTHER people play the guitar.  I'm heard just about every major classic rock artist from the 70's and can say without a doubt *many* of those classic rockers had a distinct tone and style to their guitar playing.  Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Ritchie Blackmore, David Gilmour, the list goes on.  Rory Gallagher was another guitarist who had a distinct sound and style, and as a result he's considered an extremely talented guitarist from those who've heard his music.  I agree.    Despite having a humongous discography, he isn't played on any classic rock radio station in America.  Those stations insist on playing the same few songs over and over and wouldn't DARE dip into the experimental vaults and pull out some Rory Gallagher stuff.  I guess those stations believe people who grew up in the 70's only want to hear the songs that were popular at the time.  I know from talking with many people who have an appreciation for classic rock that's completely NOT true.  Rory deserves to be remembered.  Thankfully, I can find a tall list of reviews on the internet from people all over the world who respect and admire Rory's talent.      \\"Irish Tour\\" is truly magnificent for its entire length (about 72 minutes).  I can't really explain what kind of rock and roll he's a master at, though.  He seemed to have invented his own sound.  Sometimes I think I hear Zeppelin influences in his music, along with Deep Purple's famous keyboard jams.  Moments of these two artists can be heard occasionally in Rory's music.  However, Rory is definitely MUCH more than just some forgotten musician who copied a few Zeppelin licks.  No, not at all.  He has a very energetic, exciting, experimental and emotional style to his guitar playing that I honestly have never heard before.  All the reviews that say he's a genius guitar player are exactly correct.  He deserves to be remembered the same way Led Zeppelin does.    \\"Cradle Rock\\" begins the album.  For the first couple minutes, you'll think to yourself \\"Okay, I don't see what the big deal about this guy is\\" because the track starts like it's going to be a typical energetic rocker.  However, if you're patient, you will eventually hear some guitar soloing that is simply amazing.  His guitar work is packed with so much emotion and melody, you can't help but fall in love with it.  Let me also say that I absolutely LOVE the way this album was produced.  Clear and clean production with some extremely heavy bass that rocks my speakers right off the stereo!  It's amazing because lots of other live albums from 1974 were dirty and messy.  Not this one.    I can't explain how much emotion this guy puts into his guitar solos.  His solos are always in between a solo and a jam.  That explains why every song on here goes over the 5-minute mark- he's spending most of his time on this album displaying some truly phenomenal guitar work.  If you believe you hate guitar solos, Rory Gallagher will make you change your mind.  Seriously.  I've never heard anything quite like it before.  Just when you think you're going to understand which direction he takes his music, he changes style.      Every song on \\"Irish Tour\\" is loaded with little creative goodies that never stop.  His guitar playing is all over the place and the keyboard solos are quite nice as well.  Songs like \\"Tattoo'd Lady\\" show a musician giving us a blend between a hard rock pop song and a display of guitar greatness.  \\"As The Crow Flies\\" displays brilliant acoustic work, and having a lengthy version of \\"Walk on Hot Coals\\" play immediately after \\"A Million Miles Away\\" is perhaps the greatest back-to-back live performance ever made.  Those two songs go together extremely well.  Songs like\\"Back On My Stompin' Ground (After Hours)\\" remind me of the Allman Brothers Band.      Every song on this disc is creatively addicting.  You will play this album over and over just to hear more exciting guitar work that you didn't catch the previous time you played the album.  A guitarist that truly was one of the greatest, and displayed brilliantly on \\"Irish Tour\\".  Please, I'm begging you, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!

B000002WPI|5.0|Honestly, I won't add anything new to these reviews but I feel I have to give my props.  Has to be the most original hip hop album ever created. I love people who say they love rap like TI and all those Lils that overpopulate the mainstream (Lil Wayne ain't bad tho), and have no idea who the Wu is.  The beats on this are very simple, the lyrics are incredible, and overall you can never get sick of it!!!! Defintiely one of those albums u may not completely get at first, but keep listening, its timeless.  Can't wait for 8 Diagrams to drop!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006FDCD|4.0|IT, by stephen king, well if this man is behind it then you know what you're getting. this man is genious, his books are good, and his movies are better. it's hard to do it like king i'll tell you that. if you're a fan, i'm sure you'll enjoy the films based on his books as well. most have a long running time, but there so good you harldy notice. once you start to watch you can't help but finish it. just to name a few storm of the century, pet semetary, misery, needful things, thinner, and desperation. all great movies, and they all have his touch. much respect for this man, because he knows what he's doing, and i hope he doesn't stop anytime soon. IT is just another of his that will remain a classic, as well. what's scarier than having your worst nightmare come to life. freaky. and this is what it's about. being chased by IT the clown since they were children. they must reunite once more to fight the evil clown once again. it delivers the creeps, and keeps you wanting more. although if we put all of kings novels into movies exactly how they're written they'd probably be a day long movie, well worth it i'm sure, but since they have to cut out this and omit that, the ending results are brilliant. this film is very good, and everyone's worst nightmare.
B0002TKFGI|2.0|I have heard much about these RCA SACD releases and this is my first purchase and might also be my last. Both the performance and sound quality are at best mediocre, quite the opposite of this disc's reputation.<br /><br />Recording balance is odd: percussions are loud, dry, in your face; winds are next; strings are further back; in other words, it's the opposite of a natural concert hall perspective. It's so unnatural, the performers don't seem to be in the same space.<br /><br />The sound is coarse, perhaps from frequent tape drop outs, or old tapes that were stored improperly.<br /><br />Ensemble playing is untidy, i.e. not together.<br /><br />The above comment relates to the Saint Saens played on CD, not SACD. The Debussy is even worse, sounds like a cassette tape!

630522577X|4.0|Even though the film \\"My Fair Lady\\" may seem a bit slow for our modern times, to those who enjoy musicals it will be a very pleasant experience to watch Bernard Shaw's amusing characters from Pygmalion singing while presenting us a satirical point of view of the distinction of social classes in England. Pygmalion is a play about a phonetician called professor Higgins and a linguist of Indian dialects called Colonel Pickering who make a bet that in a couple of months they can make a flower girl with a cockney accent, learn to be well-mannered and to speak as a duchess. With Higgins's overconfident attitude and Colonel Pickering's patience, they manage to transform the poor flower girl, Eliza, into a sophisticated lady.<br />The film has a different arrangement of scenes and dialogue lines from the original play \\"Pygmalion\\", but it catches the viewers interest by having a musical full of elegant costumes, humoristic lines and most importantly memorable and catchy songs played by a wonderful cast. This cast included Audrey Hepburn, who didn't really look like a low class flower girl in the beginning but appeared spectacular after the transition into a duchess. Her fine acting made the character come to life, brought spark to the play and provoked laughter to the audience quite a number of times. No one could have interpreted the new Eliza as charming, stylish and beautifully as Hepburn.  Rex Harrison also does a fine job at playing his arrogant character, Professor Higgins. Higgins always treated Eliza with a terrible attitude but as the movie develops, the viewer catches the spark of love that always existed between Eliza and Higgins. This relationship makes it a romantic musical and makes the film distinct from the original Pygmalion. In \\"Pygmalion\\", Eliza marries Freddy, but in \\"My Fair Lady\\" the producers decided that Eliza comes back to Higgins to live as a couple happily ever after. This was a typical move for the producers since most audiences prefer happy endings.<br />To sum up, \\"My Fair Lady\\", is a must-see classical for musical lovers. Songs like 'Wouldn't It Be Lovely?',  'Why Can't the English Learn to Speak' and \\"The Rain in Spain\\", make the film come to live, and allow the characters to express themselves and develop in a particular and creative way instead of just having plain, old dialogues. The actors were fantastic, and had a lot of chemistry with each other, especially Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn. The film could appear somewhat slow and dull for some people since it is old, but if you appreciate musicals and humor this is the movie for you.
B000UJ24SC|4.0|This release is just what you'd expect from one of America's best Death Metal bands, with lightning fast guitars, dual-vocals, and killer riffs. I was a little unsure about the packaging concept with album, though. With bands out there like Behemoth and Gorgoroth, who take themselves and their \\"evilness\\" so seriously that they can be downright comical at times, I was somewhat surprised by Nocturnal's Black Metal look. While it looks pretty cool, I'm somewhat suspicious of its sincerity.    While a little predictable in my opinion, this album far from disappoints. Darkness Spawned simply crushes, while seemingly speeding by without giving you a chance to breath. The surprise track is To Breathless Oblivion, with its epic scope and sweeping guitar lines. Black Dahlia has a bad habit of holding all their cords for the same amount of time on every song, while the cords on this song are held longer giving it a more epic feel. It also has the best lead on the album. For these reasons, this track stands head and shoulders above the rest of the album. I think Nocturnal would have flowed a little better had this track been the closer instead of Warborn, which is somewhat overshadowed by To Breathless Oblivion, despite its unique 3/4 section towards the end. However, there is much here that needs multiple listens to fully digest - another excellent trait of this band. The production on this album is an improvement over Miasma in the same proportion as Miasma was over Unhallowed, and the tone of Nocturnal is darker than both - a big improvement in my book.    While the packaging art is certainly a \\"new\\" step for Black Dahlia, Nocturnal really doesn't deviate much from Miasma. Judging from the fact that there seems to be a new Black Dahlia clone every week, I can't really blame them for sticking to their guns. But for my money, I'd like to see Black Dahlia take a chance with their forth album. With two excellent releases in their discography, this album is a little safe for mytaste.

0374530718|5.0|What could we say about the \\"Sophie's world\\"? It's trully increadible, for anyone who hadn't taken any advanced philosophy lessons. Reading it beguins as a magnetical curiosity (both because of the novel and the philosofical lessions in it) and ends almost as a reading addiction.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I must admit I was stunned to read the various scathing reviews of this movie, since I absolutely do not agree with them.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film and strongly feel it stood up quite well to the much-lauded 1995 BBC mini-series, even though it seems patently unfair to use another film version (which contained its own fair share of casting mistakes and flaws) as the benchmark to judge another.    First, Keira Knightley gives a remarkably convincing performance (reflected by the fact that she received well-deserved Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for this role) as the \\"not yet 21 [years old]\\" Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley was not only physically suited to play the part of Elizabeth, but she absolutely managed to capture some the spirit/petulance that is as much a part of the personality of the Austen heroine as the sharp intelligence and wit that traditionally characterizes Lizzie.  Knightley particularly shines in the well-directed rainy scene in which she lambastes Mr. Darcy, following his reluctant marriage proposal to her; Knightley is articulate and passionate in the scene and clearly demonstrates she is not only a photogenic presence on-screen, but has the chops for acting, as well.    I was initially ambivalent about Matthew Macfayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, but after watching the movie a second time, I found Macfayden's interpretation of the character to be fresh and compelling. Macfayden's distant, slightly awkward Darcy works well opposite Knightley's fiery Lizzie.  The mutual attraction between the two characters is palpable, but clearly hampered by their strong personalities and the proper decorum dictated by the period.    I particularly enjoyed the glimpse into early 19th Century life in rural England that this movie provided.  In other film interpretations of Austen's classic novel, the Bennets lived on a lavish (and hence somewhat unlikely), extremely formal and upscale style, which quite frankly, did not seem consistent with the family's alleged circumstances and situation.  In this particular film version, all of the Bennet girls looked lovely (for instance) when turned out in style (with curled hair and fresh frocks) to attend the ball at Netherfield; however, when the viewer is permitted a peek into everyday life in the Bennet household, the house itself is not only rather topsy-turvy, the Bennet sisters themselves are slightly disheveled--their clothes are suited for doing light housework and their hairstyles are mussed and flyaway as would be suited to the quiet and unpretentious lives they lead in the country.    The supporting cast is excellent; standouts would include: Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet; Dame Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourg; and Rosamund Pike who plays, as well as looks the part of Jane Bennet.  This movie version of the much-loved Austen classic stands well on it own merits and does not disappoint; it is beautifully filmed on location in various parts of England and is definitely well worth seeing.

B00007LTIB|5.0|Yes felt that they had some issues to clear up after Topographic Oceans, and Wakeman's departure. Enter Patrick Moraz, Yes \\"he's Swiss folks\\". That's the lame excuse Alan White (Yes's drummer) gave people for why Patrick really didn't fit in. Folks, this CD is One Of Their Best. And for the 2.5 years Yes toured with Relayer, the shows were Brilliant, and they knew it too. Sound Chaser will stir you up, it was thrilling as a live opener. They are fireing on all cylinders with Steve Howe's Flaminco Guitar and Patrick's European Keyboard Flair Blasts this tune off. To Be Over is a Yes Fave, Steve Howe has been  playing it SOLO in recent years at Yes shows. It's truly A Beautiful Yes song. Gates Of Dilerium is a Big Strong Yes Masterpiece, with the beautiful \\"Soon, oh Soon the Light\\" closing the big song with Hope For The Future. Yes played this on their Masterworks Tour, after resting it for 25 years. And All the Yes fans were Thrilled. Gates was so good live Yes included it on the Yesshows CD, live with Patrick. Yes fans, Buy this CD, you will love it. Certain Yes members still say it's their Favorite Yes CD! Can you guess which members still talk about a 33 year old release they played on?
B000QUCNP4|4.0|In the Sixties horoscopes and a persons zodiac sign were a big deal. So much so that it wasn't uncommon to ask someone's sign when first meeting them. The Zodiac killer filled the news especially on the West coast for some time. Between his grisly murder methods and the police's inability to stop him, the general public was in a state of disbelief. This follows the case closely from many perspectives. The acting is superb with excellent performances by Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Ruffalo, and the rest the cast. When I first heard about this movie I wasn't interested because many movies like this try so hard to be factual they lose the realism.<br /><br />This movie does an excellent job of giving facts from the case, but making you feel you were there. The acting, directing, sets, and music all make it seem as though you have travelled back in time to those moments in history around this one baffling case. I'm glad I took a chance when a rental store employee recommended it. I ended up buying it because it is thrilling and interesting to see how the police tracked him down after years of his killings and cryptic torment. I highly recommend you at least rent it if you enjoy movies like \\"Suspect Zero\\" or \\"Citizen X\\". The DVD quality is great and it comes in a nice plastic case.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|20 years ago another act like this was made by Bob Geldof to bring new attitudes against one of the most biggest problem of mankind... Well, twenty years later we're seeing that the poverty is growing and now many countries have been \\"shoted\\" by this problem...     It's very hard to say if this act, to promove shows around the world against the poverty, using singers and famous groups it's the best thing to do... But I think we need to have a position about this subject using some kinds of \\"guns\\", and the music is good way to touch or even to send a message for the people and to the government...     Well, about the dvd what can I say? A great box with a lot of music... You'll have about 10 hours of music and shows.. I liked that they promoted this stuff including all the main languages on the subtitles, english, german, french, and portuguese (thanks god!)! Great sound and a great images from the shows around the world...    I can give an important value to this event to get the reunion of the Pink Floyd after so many fights and discussions through the years.. Well, if they could come back and play again, why we can't believe that the poverty can disappear?? : ))    Great show and package... Buy it.. You won't be disappointed...
0330412744|3.0|Don DeLillo is serious, engrossing, remarkably talented writer.  But as much as I enjoy reading him, as much as I'm mesmerized by his breathtakingly masterful use of language --I'm disappointed. ... Let me try to explain.    DeLillo describes one of his characters in \\"Cosmopolis\\" as follows:     \\"She talked.  That was her job.  She was born to it and got paid for it.  But what did she believe?\\"     This is what frustrates me about Don DeLillo: he writes, masterfully; indeed, he was \\"born to it\\" -- but what does he believe?      Like many talented wrtiers nowadays, Don DeLillo knows and understand the pathologies of modern life, but the *cure* either eludes him or else he's not especially interested in exploring those pathologies.  And that leaves him and his, albeit talented, brethren profoundly incomplete as writers.    Put another way: \\"Et tu, Don?\\"      Ideology is not something that concerns many modern-day novelists and that, for me, is the fundamental problem with contemporary fiction.  One has no problem saying: \\"Sure, I get it, Orwell had an ideology; Hemingway had an ideology; Doestoyevsky had an ideology.\\"  But modern-day novelists \\"play it safe\\" when it comes to an overarching socio-political point of view.      In fact, taking a strong ideological stand would probably alienate a certain percentage of these writers' potential audience (read: market share), and where's the profit in that?  (After all, beliefs may be sacred, but profits are divine.)     Still, if Don DeLillo isn't secure enough financially to step out onto an ideological limb, who is?  He has the talent, he has the insight, but he wants to live forever -- knowing that \\"death\\" can only come if he too greatly upsets the guardians of the status quo.     And so novelists today, novelists such as Don DeLillo, \\"play it safe.\\"  While outstanding in their craftsmanship, we're still left to wonder: Yes, libermeister, you've characterized the problem brilliantly, but what's the cure?  Are you outraged by all this, or is it simply more grist for your literary mill?      Where, for example, can we place Norman Mailer nowadays, ideologically?  He was FOR the first Gulf War -- AGAINST the current one -- but supports Hilary Clinton for president, Hillary being FOR the current Gulf War!  Bing-bang-boom, he's all over the ideological map.  Many things to many people.  To quote The Church Lady: \\"How conveeeeenient!\\"      Evidently, self-professed \\"tough guys\\" aren't tough enough to stop dancing around the ideological middle, Mailer quite proudly labeling himself a \\"liberal-conservative.\\"  (Uh-huh.)    Or Philip Roth.  How, one wonders, does Philip Roth feel about the current state of affairs in and around Israel, as they relate to the Palestinian question?  How much mileage (read: fame, wealth & popularity) has Philip Roth accrued writing about Jews, and yet where has he written about the Israel government's relationship to the Palestinians and the West Bank?      I'm not saying he should take this, that or some other stand on the matter, where he stand ideologically is up to him; but, as far as I'm aware of, he hasn't taken ANY position on the issue.      Here's how desperate Philip Roth is for grist for his literary mill.  In his autobiography, \\"My Life as a Man,\\" he confesses that he married his first wife knowing beforehand that she had diabolically tricked him into marrying her by faking a pregnancy.  Why then did Roth go ahead with the marriage knowing, in advance, his wife's deceit?  Well, as Woody Allen put it at the beginning of \\"Annie Hall\\" -- he needed the eggs.  That is to say, Roth freely admits that, diabolic though she was, by going ahead and marrying his scheming wife, she would provide him with \\"interesting experiences\\" that he could transform into so much literary gold.  (Oy, the humanity!)     Lenny Bruce once said: \\"Never trust a preacher who owns more than one suit.\\"  And so to the extent novelists are our secular preachers, from a strictly prescriptive point of view, you'll excuse me but I prefer those novelists who don't know one yacht wax from another.  I rather prefer those writers who have the guts to disturb their readers by taking a stand and in doing so offer a *cure* for the pathologies they (so promiscuously) write about --  as opposed to a cleverly written play-by-play of our contemporary maladies.      Writers such as DeLillio, Mailer and Roth all profess to be \\"progressive\\" in their political point of view.  In other words, soft liberals -- reformers as opposed to radical.  But from where I sit, it takes guts to be truly progressive; it takes ideology and, with ideology, prescriptions; not just grist and talent.    Unless a writer speaks to the social, political and economic forces that profoundly influence our lives, and profoundly affect the human condition, then talented though they may be, history will see them as nothing more than skilled craftsman.  Not artists.  Not relevant to what matters to the \\"felt-lives\\" of millions upon millions of people.       Alas, Don DeLillo, you have my fullest respect as a master craftsman when it comes to the English language; and your books are full of delight and intelligence but ... I hardly know ye, paisan. ... Upon what rock do you stand?

B000AXSN5G|5.0|I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud. on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience. I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD. However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD. This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH -V by Johnny Cash. I would hope that Neil's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future. I recommend both to all Neil's fans.

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|This movie was good but frustrating if you have read the Stephen Hunter book that it came from. It may have been one of the more faithful recreations I have seen of a book into a movie. The only problem is that pretty much everything from the book was in the movie except most of it was out of sequence and out of context. For instance they use Sam Vincent's name from the novels and gave it to his dog, who's name was Mike in the book. Donny Fenn's wife was a nurse not a school teacher, this is why he went to her door in the book. Etc. Small things that made me go wow and say that as in the book all in the same sentence. I believe that if they would have followed the book faithfully that it would have been a better movie because it was one of the best novels of it's genre.
0440238609|1.0|I won't place any spoilers here but I was greatly disappointed by the trilogy.  While I found \\"The Golden Compass\\" endearing and intriguing, I was let down by \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\"  Especially \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\"  I felt like Pullman was neglecting the story in order to put forth his own religous and political views.  Many times the characters and/or story is contrived in order to further Pullman's agenda.  I also was disappointed in the many issues left unresolved.  It's unfortunate because it's an interesting premise and the characters (especially initially) are well drawn and captivating.  I found myself really caring about them.

B0000DYJM6|3.0|A loyal and sweetly put together rarities double disc from Pearl Jam is an undeniable must in any fans collection simply for the handful of amazing tracks which sometimes even go further then their best (ten-era) material ever has. Tracks that any fan already probably heard from singles (Alone, Yellow Ledbetter) remain some of their strongest rock, capturing the underutilized McCready at his fiery best before the post-Vs, Vedder-induced subduing kicked in. For fans Lost Dogs undoubtedly scores big, and even first time listeners will enjoy a minority of The Jam in it's essence, but the majority remains fans-only turf. As a single disc the material definitely would have avoided the typical B-sides stench which plagues many artists, but as a double even Pearl Jam's impressive vaults yield some unspectacular riffs and slightly silly outings. The first disc has a higher ratio of these genre-stinkers, but as Ledbetter fades out and the superior disc two kicks in we are once again reminded of why there are many treats amongst the tricks.
B000B8QG22|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful movie, both hilarious in classic Robin Williams style and emotional.  I think this is Robin Williams best movie of all time, and i've seen all of them.  The special features are nothing to write home about (Pretty much just talking about how Robin improvised nearly the entire first half of the movie), but that doesn't change the fact that this is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time.  So get the special edition if you want the features, don't if not, but regardless, this movie is a must have for anyone who has ever even chuckled at anything that has ever come out of the mouth that is the one and only Robin Williams.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|If someone described this movie being simply about a stoner who bowls and lays on rugs, well... they would be right.  But don't let that scare you, it is a surprisingly compelling movie.  I would feel comfortable calling this the best bad movie I've ever seen.  I can understand where this would be a hit-or-miss movie, but if you like rough, crude humor, this is a must see.
B00005JPTA|5.0|It is about time that Viggo Mortensen gets is due. He and Naomi Watts light up the screen in this film, as they are two of the best in the business. Vincent Cassel is also convincing in his role as the son of a crime boss. Basically, Watts is a midwife who is trying to do a good thing when she stumbles across some information that gets her tangled up with an underground crime organization. There are several shocking, emotional scenes, and enough plot twists - consistent with Cronenberg's earlier works - to keep you guessing and keep you glued to the screen throughout. If you are a fan of Cronenberg (or Mortensen or Watts, for that matter), you will like this film. Don't expect a bloodbath along the lines of Goodfellas or History of Violence, though. This film is all about the plot, with the backdrop of beautiful scenery and tension you could cut with a knife. This film will make you think, but it will not confuse you, either. These actors are insanely good, and Mortensen, in particular, gives the performance of a lifetime, which makes the film more than worth the price of admission. This is entertainment at its finest, and anyone who thinks that Hollywood is not making any good original films these days should see this one. Sick of all the remakes and summer sequels? This is your remedy.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|Season 1 of the series Heroes on HD DVD has a similar number of episodes and sells for $59, less than half the price of this money-grubbing Trek release.  Furthermore, Heroes is new and was shot directly in HD with the highest possible quality.  Trek is 40 year old celluloid film full of age defects and warmed over with some new special effects which are few and far between.    Nevertheless I was looking forward to a high-def Trek release, but I'm not going to pay more than double the going rate for a TV series on HD DVD.  This is the worst type of cynical marketing, I can only imagine their HD-ignorant execs decided that only hopeless fanboys would buy this release and would pay no attention to the price.  I don't care how much of a Trek fan you are, avoid this release to send a message that this pricing is not going to be tolerated, or look forward to similar extortion for future Paramount series in HD.

B000OCY7JE|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />From Denmark comes \\"After the Wedding,\\" an unusually rich and complex human drama, marked by superb performances, insightful writing, and stylish direction by Susanne Bier.  Nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Foreign Language Film of 2006 (but not released commercially in the U.S. until the following year), this is one of the true unheralded movie gems of 2007.<br /><br />Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) is a dedicated social worker from Denmark whose orphanage in India has caught the eye of a Danish philanthropist named Jergen (Rolf Lassgard), who summons the young man to Copenhagen to discuss his plan for donating a substantial sum of his own money to the project.  While in the city, Jacob is invited to attend the wedding of Jergen's adopted daughter, Anna, only to discover when he gets there that Jergen's wife is, in reality, his old girlfriend, Helene, and that Anna might, in fact, be the child he never knew he had.<br /><br />With a screenplay by Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, \\"After the Wedding\\" transcends the \\"soap opera\\" nature of its premise to become a deeply moving study of the compromises and sacrifices all of us are forced to make throughout the course of our lives.  The characters the writers have come up with are admirably complex, credibly three-dimensional, and never all that easy to peg.  With his somber, deeply lined face masking the emotional turmoil within, Mikkelsen gives a darkly brooding performance as a man who finds it easier to give of himself on a grand scale - i.e., trying to save the world - than to make a meaningful connection with any single individual.  Sidse Babette Knudson is poised and lovely as Jacob`s deeply conflicted former lover and Jergen`s wife, while Lassgard hits amazing dramatic heights as Jergen, who is, in many ways, the most enigmatic of the three main characters.  For much of the film, we are left to ponder whether Jergen is a genuinely good man or merely a world-class manipulator who enjoys playing god with the lives of those around him.  Finally, Stine Fischer Christensen delivers a deeply touching performance as the vulnerable young woman whose wedding serves as the catalyst for much of the drama.  There are no heroes or villains in this piece, only flawed but well-meaning and believable individuals whom we come to care deeply about throughout the course of the film.<br /><br />In her direction, Bier brings a great deal of texture to the work, focusing on the subtle details of the scenes and boring into the very souls of the characters through intense close-up concentration on the actors' pores and eyes.  The music by Johan Soderqvist is subtle and haunting and adds tremendous flavor to the drama.<br /><br />\\"After the Wedding\\" is a beautiful film that sweeps us up in its story and characters and makes us intimate participants in the world it is showing us.

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|This movie is all about one man done wrong twice & both times by his own government. Mark Walhberg's character, Bob Lee Swagger, is the best sniper/marksman out there & trained by our government's military.     When Bob Lee Swagger is left to fend for himself while in combat by our country's military, he decides to retreat from society disillusioned that his own country would leave him to possibly die in enemy territory while serving his country.     Three years later, the government comes a knocking once again on Bob Lee Swagger front door, asking him to serve his country once again. This time they want him to figure out how and where a sniper might hide in order to kill the president during a set of public speaking engagements. In doing this task, Bob Lee Swagger becomes a prime suspect in the conspiracy to kill the President by the very same people whom have asked him to help them! Bob Lee Swagger must flee for his life after being shot, avoid being captured, and attempt to clear his name with the aid of two other people.    It seems highly likely that Bob Lee Swagger could survive being shot, avoid being captured by the FBI, and attempt to clear his name with ONLY the aid of two other people.... One of whom is an amateur! This movie is all about revenge, vigilante style. It is sort of a modern day version of a Charles Bronson flick, but with Bob Lee Swagger having a little more compassion and depth of character then Bronson's characters.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|For my money, the third season of Stargate Atlantis is the best thus far. All of the seasons have been somewhat hit-and-miss, in terms of episode quality, but I think season three brings a wealth of much-needed character development. We learn more about the mysterious Sheppard in \\"Phantoms\\" and the taciturn Ronon Dex in \\"Sateda,\\" while the episodes \\"McKay and Mrs. Miller\\" and \\"The Tao of Rodney\\" provide new dimensions to the brilliant and blustery Rodney McKay. McKay's character arc alone -- looking from his original guest appearances years ago on SG-1 to the newest Atlantis offerings -- is staggering, and David Hewlett greatly deserves the praise he's received for his performance. Outside of something like Firefly, I think it's rare to see a show in this genre explore so much of the characters' backstories, and it's gratifying to see it finally happening for SGA.     Teyla is certainly underutilized, and I hope that this season will bring new depths to her character. From what I've heard, there is definitely the opportunity for that to happen.
0975991477|3.0|I certainly applaud the author, especially one from such a science-oriented background, for writing this book. He attempts to \\"prove\\" the power of the mind with scientific studies, etc. On some levels he succeeds; there are certainly some surprising and interesting studies he cites.   However, the book is entirely too filled with tedious, dry scientific discussion that, in my opinion, really didn't need to be there. He could've greatly shorted that part of the book. Also, I can't help but raise and eyebrow at parts of the book where the author says things like \\"I discovered the secret of life.\\" His \\"secret\\" is something that, if you've been involved at all in \\"alternative medicine\\" for any amount of time, you'd already know. Also, I think that comment was entirely inaccurate. I didn't come out of this feeling there was any ground-breaking, belief-shattering discovery. Compelling, yes, powerful, yes, but come on, don't go overboard.  In the end, he provides very little that you can actually do to change your biology, other than \\"think positive thoughts\\" and similar things. Again, something energetic healers have known for decades, if not centuries. Almost as an afterthought, he has a section at the end, about two pages, where he mentions an exciting new science based on energetic psychology, that can greatly change peoples long-standing beliefs, and reprogram their subconcious, leading to true change. THAT is what I was lead to believe THIS book was about. So, overall, I would skip this book and get another book that actually expands on this idea.

B000UJCALI|4.0|The only reason he preferred 1:33 for video release was TVs were at that time 1:33 and he thought the letterboxing made the image too small.    But now TVs are an approximation of the 1:85 theatre aspect ratio, so the films should be presented on DVD as they were conceived.  Kubrick composed the shots for THE SHINING to be 1:85.     Think about it...Having a 1:33 image on your widescreen TV is EXACTLY the kind of letterboxing Kubrick didn't want...Black bars around the image making it smaller.    So chill out...This is how it's meant to be seen.  Otherwise, SHINING would have been 1:33 in the theatre.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|I purchased Riot! after seeing Paramore perform live on TV.  I was attracted to the energy of the music, the chemistry between band members, and the vivacity of the performance.  They were able to capture all of that and more on this CD.  It's amazing just how young this band is.  Despite their age, and this being only their second full-length album, the songs are expertly crafted and the lyrics are maturer than those of many of the top pop-punk bands who have been recording for years.    The album features a number of rip-roaring rock anthems including the opening number, \\"For a Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic\\", the first hit single, \\"Misery Business\\", \\"Born For This\\", and the second single \\"Crushcrushcrush\\".  The album also features softer tunes which really let lead singer, Hayley Williams, voice shine.  The vocals are particularly good in \\"We Are Broken\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\".  Hayley's voice is truly one of the best in the business.  She exhibits great range, has tremendous energy, yet still has the power in her voice to really rock.  One track that really caught my attention was \\"Fences\\" .  It features a swing sound that is quite different from the rest of the album.  It gives me hope that Paramore will be able to continue to grow musically.    This is a very strong sophomore album from a young band.  The best thing I can say about this album is that it's tons of fun to listen to.  I plan on seeing them live the first opportunity I get.  Take a chance with this album, its much better than most of the pop rock out there.    Best Songs: Misery Business, For a Pessimist,I'm Pretty Optimistic, Crushcrushcrush   For Fans Of: [[ASIN:B000NA283O The Academy Is]], [[ASIN:B000LC4ZIK Fall Out Boy]], [[ASIN:B000FFP00A Cute Is What We Aim For]]
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Yes, the title reveals my bias. I am a Browncoat. So why wouldn't I love this product? I realize that some of the extra goodies are simply things that any astute searcher could locate via the internet (the River Tam sessions), but the packaging alone is a marked improvement over the original release. Even for the non-Browncoats out there, this is a special edition worth stuffing in the birthday or holiday gift bag. The extra DVD commentary is light-hearted fun that illustrates the joy and love that the creators and actors had for this project. Overall, a purchase worthy of space on your DVD shelf.
0679805273|5.0|The all-time BEST book by any author for any age. How true to life this classic story is. Could only be sequeled by \\"Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky  You Are\\"? A must for every household.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I thought this was one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen.  The story-line was was funny, action-filled, and suspenseful. The characters felt like real people. The performances were so nuanced that at first I thought that this movie was based on a book. I started looking for the book and found the Firefly TV Series (which I also enjoyed and am very mad that the best TV show I never saw got cancelled.) I landed up buying not only this movie but the Firely Series and have watched all of them over 3 times each. I am hoping there will be a Serenity sequel!
B000063DI8|4.0|I would consider No Prayer a classic Maiden release, and to me anyway it can be listened to along with everything before it...and it holds up just as well. It's not as good as the early stuff, but it has all the aspects in some form or another here.  Straight ahead stuff like my favs \\"Tailgunner\\", \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"Hooks In You\\", and \\"Bring Your Daughter...\\" along with some mini epic songs like \\"Fates Warning\\", \\"No Prayer for The Dying\\", \\"Public Enema Number One\\". \\"Mother Russia\\" that closes the album is probably the most epic of the songs on here, it's no \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\"; but it has a nice feel to it I think, classic Maiden nonetheless.    This album manages to capture a dark feel to it also, perhaps not as dark as Number Of The Beast or the first two CD's, but it to ranks up there I feel. Not a dud on here IMO, and something for everyone, and no matter what mood you are in, you can enjoy this one....I prefer the September - October to listen to this along with the first 2 or 3 Cd's myself.
B000005RST|4.0|This is my second favorite Enigma album after \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\" (mainly because the \\"New Age\\" vibe is more present in the later one). But since MCMXC a.D. was the first Cretu project as \\"Enigma\\" it has something special that the later projects do not have: the discovery of a new sound. I would rate this album with 5 stars, but there is a track in the album that I dislike (\\"the voice & the snake\\") which resembles some sort of spoken ritual and it kind of ruins the mood of the album since all tracks are continuously mixed (no gaps). If you already own the original CD and not the \\"limited edition\\" one, it's worth getting it because of the 4 bonus remixes (which are only available in hard-to-find Singles) and the special track \\"The Rivers Of Belief (The Returning Silence)\\" which is exclusive to this edition of the album. The bonus tracks are also mixed continuously (no gaps) and the rest of the album is split in more playable tracks (unlike the original CD which plays the tracks as segments/chapters).

B000VZUWZW|1.0|The sitcom version of \\"Beauty and the Geek\\", this will be gone faster than you can split an atom.  Kaley Cuoco might be easy on the eyes, but the two geeks plus their friends have dialogue that's way over the heads of the intended audience (think \\"Numb3rs\\" without the explination).  It's hard to concieve how the writers could evolve this past the second or third episode.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes might wind up on pop radio and have their share of hit singles, but in a way they really defy the direction that pop rock has gone in the past few years. Rock music has become dangerously stale, with very few artist that can say that they sound unique or different from other bands. Take Nickelback for example. There are at least four other bands that sound exactly like them, both vocal and song stucture with the likes of Hinder, Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, and Seether and once again this is a small sample. Even though I will admit the Stripes use simple chords and have limited amount of change from song to song, they do bring a certain flavor to their music. For the most part they are a bluesy retro rock band with small flavors of punk, but Jack and Meg bring something more to table with \\"Icky Thump\\". \\"Icky Thump\\" has less pop and technical aspects then the subpar \\"Get Behind me Satan\\" and goes back to a more in your face rawness of garage rock. They album also has a strong mexican musical flavor to it, which Jack and Meg intelligently infuse in their music. \\"Icky Thump\\" isnt perfect, as there are some tracks that are pretty close to horrid, but for the most part, the Stripes pull off another great effort, without sounding stale and like everyone else in the pop/rock/punk world.
0671027344|4.0|I had to read this for school and let me just say, you will probably feel pretty depressed at the end of this book. The whole book has this cloud of dead always surrounding it. Another than that, it's a pretty good book. It's got alost of teen issues and sexual things in it, so I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 14 or 15.

0440238609|2.0|Just wanted to put a warning out there for folks interested in reading this series: it ends with a flop!    What begins as character development and an exploration of the author's perspective of coming of age and the human experience becomes a contrived soap box in the final book.    The first couple of books are engaging and interesting - but the mystery of the story line is consistently put off in expectation of the books conclusion. But, unfortunately, the author seems unable to solve the mystery he created. How unfortunate that his theological views lack the mystery that is inherent in our experience! He instead tries to conclude the series with a rather dismal attempt at verbalizing his own (rather contrived, in my opinion) view points about the nature of the universe and God. And he does so very unconvincingly.    What blows my mind is that, though he claims at explaining God, he never really addresses who god (the creator) is. Instead, we are given a description of satan, who was supposed to be God's imposter? The purpose of creation, explained in dust, etc... open-ended and very dissatisfying! In retrospect, I would say that Mr Pullman communicates only a distrust and antagonism to the church and religion, without providing a convincing argument to what he beieves to be the truth regarding the subject.    For those people with children - save them the effort and confusion, because that's all this book will give them! The deeper subjects of the soul, god, the church, etc are very poorly addressed. You're left wishing he would stick to the subjects he started with - namely coming of age and the human experience, rather than endeavoring to address the subject of truth, God, and religion.

John Steinbeck's [[ASIN:0142000663 The Grapes of Wrath (Centennial Edition)]], about a man returning home from prison and dealing with his world around him.    One of the best movies I've ever seen.

B000J103X4|5.0|The Game's official sophomre release is an excellent CD.  The production is tight and the lyrics are just as amazing.  The Game returns in style, from the beginning of Lookin' At You to the end of the CD.    My favorites are Da S***, One Blood, Compton, Remedy, One Night, Doctor's Advocate, Ol' English, California Vacation, Why You Hate the Game, and the bonus track I'm Chillin.    Highly recommended.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Having seen this program from the first BBc showing, it is the finist the Beeb has yet done.  NOT FOR CHILDREN the language is very street, and some words are being changed for the US TV release.  13 episodes leave you wanting more, and the drama that starts with the return of a group of air passangers from the 1950's is unbelevable.  Having seen teh end of the trird season of the New Dr. Who, now we knnow more about Captain Jack and his background. With lluck this will help others understand this person leading Torchwood better. CSI + X-FILES just don't do it justice. As stated above this show is not for children, The BBC has stated Dr. Who can have Torchwood on it, but due to the adult nature of Torchwood, the Doctor will not be allowed on it.  The Dr is for families, this is not. The Sci-Fi is very hard-core, in more ways than one, and if your looking for a friendly new spin-off of Dr. Who try \\"The Adventures of Sarah Jane\\", which should be on DVD soon, it just finished in the UK. If you like Battlestar's new look, and can deal witht eh fact the world is not going to be green and happy every episode this show is for you. I'm very much looking forward to season two, and hope you will also.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Graduation is a good release.  It's not as good as his others but it is definitely one of the better CD's of the year.  From the opening of Good Morning, it's evident this is a different Kanye West.  His music has matured but a little too much.    My Favorites are:  Good Morning  Stronger  Good Life  Can't Tell Me Nothing  The Glory  Homecoming    Highly recommended
1931559317|4.0|This is a wonderful little star atlas. Very useful for doing the Astronomical league's Messier Club. In the back of the book (last page, very easy to find) is the messier list with the page number of the item.    In the front of the book are other lists.    It's very portable but at the cost of small pages and constellations often run off the page. The pages do have a decent amount of overlap which helps when star-hopping.    The one thing I wish it had and was why I gave it four stars instead of five, I wish the pages were somehow coated so that dew wouldn't make the pages soggy. The pages are tougher than standard paper, but not dew proof.
0785123490|5.0|I had already read this story before I got the compilation version. Thanos is by far one of the best villians I have ever read about. He appears to be a villian but from his point of view, he doesnt really see a good or bad in anything. The action is great and does make sense in the marvel universe. This story is meant for animation and would easily be on a higher level then the previous cartoon movies that have been released. The story of thanos getting the infinity gems is just as much fun as seeing him use them to mess with everyone including the cosmic beings.
1594489505|5.0|Unlike most readers, I read A Thousand Splendid Suns without having been introduced to Hosseini by The Kite Runner. I was thoroughly impressed by his storytelling ability and the way he gives depth and detail to his characters. I do think that the motivations of the male characters are not really explored (I'm thinking of Rasheed, the foremost male character in this novel) but I've heard that The Kite Runner focused on male relationships and that \\"...Suns\\" is about female relationships. I liked this book so much that I just bought and have begun reading The Kite Runner. A Thousand Splendid Suns inspired me to send donations to an Afghan refugee aid organization. I realize this review is brief and disorganized but my point is this: it's an excellent book, worth every second I spent reading it.
6305428352|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I saw this movie when it first came out which was several years ago, and I still cry. It is so inspiring, and even though it is just a movie, it does show you real life experiences about the emotions that you have to face being a teacher and also a father. In this situation, a father with a special needs child. Anyhow, if you haven't seen it, you need to see it. Enjoy!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is such a great movie on so many levels. I love Jane Austen and all, but this story has more than just the strivings of the few who really matter to the story. The \\"background\\" characters hold their own and you are just as interested in them as the main characters. There is also quite a bit about unions and working conditions in this day and age of industrial revolution. No, it is not Marxist, it is \\"Smithist\\" in it's portrayal of masters and workers. Bottom line: it's four hours of pure enjoyment. Great movie, great cast, great music, great everything. Fanny is my favorite portrayal, but everyone does an excellent job.
0307346609|5.0|The only thing I don't understand is how I missed this. I would think I would remember this happening, but I guess I must have been in college or something. Anyway, it's pretty good reporting - it's obvious that Brooks did a ton of research, and he interviewed a pretty impressive number of people. Their stories are amazing. I can't believe I missed a global catastrophy like this. Did this happen before I was born? Why don't they teach about this in highschool? Is it some kind of government suppression? I just hope it never happens again.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|Director Frank Oz [aka Oznowicz] was actually born in England, and he was raised in America. A very talented actor, with 104 film appearances on his resume -he also specialized in \\"voice work\\". He and Jim Henson created the whole MUPPETS phenomenon. He created multiple characters, the most famous of which were Kermit and Miss Piggy. He is equally well known for being the voice of Yoda for the George Lucas STAR WARS series. As a director he has made 14 films, varying from THE DARK CRYSTAL (1982), through the classic fun of WHAT ABOUT BOB? (1991). All the way across the spectrum to the crime thriller, THE SCORE (2001), with Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Marlon Brando. DEATH AT A FUNERAL (2007) represents his triumphant return to comedy; and what a dark and delicious foray it is.<br /><br />A farce of the first order, this film is about a normally dysfunctional family who are forced to confront each other at a patriarch's funeral. The amazing script was written by Dean Craig. He is a young writer/director with only four films to his credit. In 2003 he gave us DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS. His script for FUNERAL was filled with wafts, even wads of wit, had terrific internal timing, a solid structure and plot, with a delectable and irreverent sense of humor. It is a film so completely farcical that I believe it could be produced on stage, in live theatre. All those slamming doors, crossed-over plotlines, and zany characters would lend themselves to some outrageous theatrical moments.<br /><br />Attending the film I was happy to give in to the instant giddiness that most of the audience immediately lapsed into -beginning to titter and then guffaw while the opening credits were still rolling.

B0000033IS|5.0|monster killer album. Aretha smokes on this one!!! She's made some excellent albums and had a seemingly inexhaustable run on various singles charts, but the fire, energy, and intensity she puts forth here takes some beating, and is a joy to behold. Is this the best soul album of all time? Probably would spark a huge debate, but I tell you what, in my humble opinion, it's close, and quite frankly, the real deal is that it's one of the best albums of all time period. Released uh, shall we just say, waaaaay back in the day, ok 40 years ago and it's STILL an incredible listen now. It truly doesn't get any better than this.

B00008FRRE|5.0|back in 1991 Michael Jackson re emerged with a new sound and vibe.  He came back with a New Jack Swing and  more edge to his sound.

075640407X|5.0|[[ASIN:075640407X The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day One)]]<br /><br />We've all heard the phrase \\"the art of storytelling.\\" It's used so much, it borders on being a cliche. However, after reading this wonderful first novel by Patrick Rothfuss, I suddenly understood where the phrase had come from.<br /><br />I've always been a sucker for a well-told tale, and The Name of the Wind is that and more. A story wrapped in a story wrapped in a story, ...Wind is an astounding feat of storytelling. While it's not a perfect book (there are some repeated lines in several places in this nearly 700-page book), I was easily able to forgive any speedbumps I happened across, as the story itself drew me in so deeply, I do believe I misplaced an entire week of my life while engrossed in this beautiful fantasy novel.<br /><br />If you're an avid reader of fantasy and haven't picked this one up yet, do so as soon as you can. It's a delicious tale, deliciously told. I can't wait for the next one in the trilogy, The Wise Man's Fear, due out sometime next year.
0375831002|5.0|What a powerful, wonderful book! It was heart-rending, heart-warming, wonderful, painful, compelling... all these things and more. I've just finished listening to this book and I feel stunned and rather bruised. It is such a powerful, wonderful book, yet the subject matter is very sad and at times horrific. I am pretty amazed that this is supposed to be a children's book (first of all, it is huge!). It is so very well written, and the narration was absolutely beyond perfection. In all my years, I have never deeply considered what it must have been like as a young child or teen living in Nazi Germany. This book is vividly written, and I feel as though I lived with the child characters. As a book lover and collector, this book spoke to my spirit and soul. All I can say is \\"READ IT.\\"  On a practical note, I think that a person who listens to this book should also have the hard copy available so that they can see the drawings within its page
B00005LC1H|5.0|Very little of what has ever been on TV can accurately be called essential viewing, but this brief but magnificent series is surely one of them. For those who have never witnessed an episode of \\"Fawlty Towers,\\" you will want to forget most of what you thought you knew about John Cleese from his immortal Python days. Certainly all of the physical comedy is intact, as well as Cleese's love of humor derived from the fertile fields of embarrassment and miscommunication. But in \\"Fawlty Towers\\" all of Cleese's best instincts as both a comedian and a humorist are refined by orders of magnitude, and more prominently on display than they ever could have been in the crowded Python collaboration.     This is screamingly funny stuff. But even more importantly, the material resonates deeply on a human level. Basil Fawlty may be the rudest, most obnoxious, impatient, pigheaded and vein individual ever portrayed on the tiny screen -- but if we don't see just a little bit of our own vanities and foibles in Basil, then we're probably not being entirely honest with ourselves. Much of the astonishing intensity of the humor in \\"Fawlty Towers\\" springs from the little voice inside our heads that says, \\"There but for the grace of God go I.\\"     To Cleese's great credit, he hold Basil up more for examination than ridicule. Although clearly Basil is his own worst enemy, and while we could not possible feel any real warmth toward him, we nevertheless sympathize with his plight. This sharpness of observation is why \\"Fawlty Towers\\" is more than just a funny TV series, and why it soars to very special and rare heights. Simply said, this series is a work of genuine comic genius.    As far as the DVD set is concerned, American viewers have to be continually disappointed with the decision of BBC Warner to release British TV shows on DVD in the US 4:3 (1.33:1) format instead of their original PAL screen ratio. In that sense, American viewers have never actually seen the complete \\"Fawlty Towers.\\" What a shame, and how completely unnecessary. This set comes with special feature cast members interviews which were produced in a surprisingly amateurish manner. They're better than nothing, but such an important TV series certainly deserved a higher quality treatment.
0743496728|5.0|I read the hardback version along with listening to the audio version which was very well narrated by Carol Monda. What an emotionally wrenching book! And I mean that in the best possible way. Writing is good writing when it moves you, when it causes you to feel and to have emotions. This book certainly did that for me. It is powerfully written.  Many people have said they didn't like the ending, but I thought it was well written and very plausible. Very true to life in my opinion.<br /><br /> I read this book over many weeks and find myself missing the characters now. I keep wondering how Josie is doing....  I started reading this novel just after the Virginia Tech murders happened, so I kept seeing the images from the news in my mind's eye as I read. It brought it all very close to home. I found it difficult to read at first, for that very reason, then it helped bring some sort of healing somehow.<br /><br />As I read it, I was continually drawn to Laci, the shooter's mother. I felt that Picoult really captured her side of this story, and portrayed it realistically and compassionately.<br /><br />Powerful book. Read it!
0876852630|5.0|Charles Bukowski (1920-1994) was an underground writer of poems stories, and novels who has exerted a fascination over me for many years. He is best known for his portrayals of the shabby, dingy side of Los Angeles. His reputation has grown subsequently to his death. Many of his works originally were published by a small publishing house, Black Sparrow Press which specialized in unusual writers, A few years ago, Black Sparrow was purchased by a HarperCollins which continues to maintain Bukowski's works in print and to publish posthumous works.<br /><br />Last year, an independently-produced film of \\"Factotum\\" was released starring Matt Dillion and Lili Taylor.  The movie sparked substantial interest in Bukowski and in his novel. Earlier Bukowski movies include \\"Barfly\\" (1987) and the documentary \\"Bukowski: Born into This\\" (2004).<br /><br />Bukowski's novels are autobiographical in character and feature an alter-ego named Henry Chinaski. Factotum (1975)was Bukowski's second novel and was written when he was already on the path to success as a writer. He had left the life he described in the book behind almost three decades earlier.  As a result, the book gains a great deal by a measure of artistic distance.<br /><br />The word 'factotum\\" means \\"A person having many diverse activities or responsibilities\\" or \\"a general servant\\". These definitions, particularly the second, capture much of the spirit of the novel. Chinaski is a young man, down and out, who has been rejected for the draft during WW II. In short, fast-moving chapters, the novel chronicles Chinaski's search for work crossing back and forth throughout the United States.<br /><br />The novel is gritty, raw and tough. Chinaski is hardly a hero as he loses one dead-end job after another and throws away the few possible opportunities that come his way. Chinaski is solitary and anti-social. He drinks heavily and plays the horses. He takes up with women and generally drops them as quickly as he meets them. He leads the life of a drifter, loner, and outsider.<br /><br />Without prelude or introduction, the book opens as Chinaski arrives \\"in New Orleans in the rain at 5\\"o'clock in the morning\\" and is quickly accosted by \\"a high yellow sitting on the porch steps swinging her legs\\". He goes through a series of jobs and shabby hotels before embarking on a journey that takes him to Texas, Los Angeles, his hometown, New York City, Philadelphia, St Louis and, finally back to Los Angeles. At the end, we see Chinaski, frustrated and angry fantasizing over a dancer in a burlesque house.<br /><br />Chinaski loses a litany of jobs, including working as a janitor, window washer, shipping clerk, baker's helper, assistant in a dog buscuit factory, and similar ventures. He either quits, or, more often, is fired for absenteeism, attitude, fighting, and drinking. He has affairs with a variety of women, the most prominent of whom in this book is Jan, with whom he has an on again off again relationship punctuated by alcohol, horseracing, fighting, and Jan's affairs with other men.<br /><br />Chinaski is an aspiring writer, when he is not drinking or otherwise occupied, and the book includes a scene in which a short story is accepted for publication. Writing and reflection are used, as is so often the case, as a way to understand and distance oneself from a shabby, difficult life. There are many lively, funny scenes in Factotum. Chinaski does not ask for sympathy and gives none. The story is toughly and unapologetically told. The book gives the impression of an individual deeply down on himself and on others who sees himself as fighting and carrying on simply to live his life for what it is.<br /><br />Bukowski is a vulgar, raw author who will not appeal to everyone. But I continue to be taken with him and with Factotum. The book exerts a pull that I can't shake off.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanner, and outsider.

1594489505|5.0|While this was a very painful book to listen to/read, it was well worth it by the time the end came near. It is a very profoundly sad at times, and horrifying as well. It is indeed haunting, heartbreaking and compelling. Hosseini is able to take his reader right into the story, and it feels as though one is right there with the characters experiencing it alongside of them. Although this was set in Afghanistan with all the horrors of being a woman there, I believe there is a universality to some of the themes within the story: domestic violence, abuse, helplessness, etc. Hosseini's books have opened up a new culture and experience for me and caused me to have a deep appreciation for Afghani women and their suffering. Even though this is a painful story, there is much beauty within its pages.
B000SQFC0E|5.0|Great movie and great HD DVD disc.The Last Star Fighter is one of my favorite movies from the 80's.It is one of my must watched DVD's that I have.When it was anounced that The Last Star Fighter was coming out on HD DVD I wasnt so sure if I wanted to double dip as the picture quality on the DVD was good,but not great.Well I decided to get it anyways and right from the start of the movie I knew I made a wise choise.The Last Star Fighter looks great in High Def and it blows the standard def DVD version away.The sound is not bad either and Universal has included a Dolby True track.The special features are the same as the previous DVD version-Making off,commentary with Nick Castle.Universal has done a great job with this HD DVD and I'm sure I'll be playing my copy alot.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|I bought Get born because I knew that I liked the 4 singles that I had heard on the radio.  It turns out, those were the only 4 songs I liked on the cd.  It wasn't that the other songs were bad or boring, I just wasn't into them like I was the singles.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Great movie about an unemployed, divorced, injured woman with 3 children.  She feels abandoned by the lawyer she hired to get her compensation for her injury, so she pushes him to hire her, complete with her unconventional ways of working.  Highly recommend it.
055358894X|2.0|Mr. Lynch has some decent ideas but this book is a tough read.  The story jumps around with very little transition and can be tough to follow.  It is also filled with gratuitous vulgarity from curse words to obscene comments.  I am not easily offended but the language shocks you away from the story.  This book desperately needs an editor and a rewrite, until that happens don't waste your time.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|The filming, set production, acting, and costume pieces are all fantastic and well done. I've seen this movie a dozen times at least and will continue to watch it through the years. Gweneth Paltrow is right on target with her protrayal of Emma and I think you will agree.
B00004YA66|5.0|Wow, what a suspenseful film! This is a combination crime and fantasy story, a time-travel theme employed as a son is able to talk to his father 30 years in the past and help change history for the better. Far-fetched? Oh, of course, but it's not meant to be taken seriously as something that could happen. Like \\"Field Of Dreams,\\" it's pure fantasy but a nice father-and-son vehicle that makes you - or at least it did me - bring a tear or two to your eyes.    The young guy is played by Jim Caviel and his dad is played by Dennis Quaid. Both are excellent and likable guys, as they usually are in the films they play.     I've watched this four times in the last four years and totally enjoyed it each time. It''s highly recommended.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is not a fast paced Jane Austin with sassy dialogue and intrigue but it's calmer pace is delightful. It's a beautiful story and this adaptation is excellent. The book of course lends much more to the story but for a movie this does a great job of telling the story in a short time frame. Love it
B00003BDXG|3.0|This is so stylishly-filmed it's unbelievable. The wild camera techniques - quick flashes, sudden changes from color to black-and-white and back, distorted sound bytes, tilted camera angles, wild colors and symbolic images, distorted sound bytes - are all fascinating to watch. Then there's the crazy story, which ranges from really good to really bad. It's good to see the tabloid media mentality mocked for the trash it is, glorifying evil just to get ratings and the evil killers feeding off that media frenzy. Most of the characters in this film, as bad as they are, are definitely attention-getting. The two leads, \\"Mickey and Mallory\\" are two names that now go together, thanks to this film and the ultra-sleazy portrayals of them by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis.    The \\"bad news\\" is that most of the people in this film, if not all, are so vile, so profane, so morally bankrupt, so disgusting you may want to take a shower after watching this film. Even the film critics who gravitate toward evil were repulsed by this movie. I actually enjoyed the story up to a point: about the halfway mark. After that, it becomes one gigantic mess, almost too difficult to watch in one sitting. I am mainly referring to all the scenes in the prison including the drawn- out riot/prison break, which goes on way too long.     Overall, in order to stomach this film, you have to look at it as some outrageous satire on violence and the media and take these characters as extreme cartoon-like people and nothing else. Take nothing seriously here.
B000EEX93M|5.0|MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING may have been the first cookbook I ever bought--as a new bride, way back when--and, decades later, it remains the best.    Though the authors now are cooking in heaven, in their day, during the early 1960s, Julia Child and her partners changed the way that America thought about food.    They broadened the awareness of American cooks, and taught us that there was more to cuisine than roast beef and overcooked vegetables: radical concepts at that time. They introduced us to a new battery of utensils, and a new palette of seasonings. Our kitchens never have been the same.    Even today, their recipes remain the best of class and their dissertations on technique remain unequaled in contemporary food writing.    If you are going to have just one cookbook, then MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING is that book...if you are going to add a second cookbook, go for Volume Two.
B000TLMWMY|3.0|Having been a Johnny Cash fan since I was a teenager, and having watched his variety show on television when it was first aired, I was delighted to hear about this new, two DVD set containing many highlights from his variety show.  And although it contains a lot of wonderful music--such as Johnny and Louis Armstrong singing an old Jimmy Rodgers standard--it's puzzling as to what the producers decided to leave out.   I can think of quite a few superb examples of performances that have not been included in this set that I remember seeing on the show when first aired, but let me just site two.  On the very first program of the series, Bob Dylan did an amazing version of his song \\"Living the Blues\\" which was far superior to his studio version on \\"Self Portrait,\\" which came out around the same time.  Yet, instead of  \\"Living the Blues,\\" we get \\"I Threw It All Away;\\" a nice number to be sure, but very similar to the version on Dylan's \\"Nashville Skyline\\" album.  The live \\"Living the Blues,\\" that Dylan did has never had an official release, either on video or on audio, although it's shown up on many Dylan bootlegs.  Similarly,  on that very first show of the series, Johnny and Joni Mitchell did an unforgettable version of Johnny's own song \\"I Still Miss Someone,\\" and yet instead of this, we get \\"The Long Black Veil;\\" it too is nice but hardly compares to their heartbreaking rendition of \\"I Still Miss Someone.\\" Although this DVD set remains a good  sampling of what the series had to offer, and contains some very remarkable music, I would hardly call it \\"the Best\\" of the Johnny Cash variety show.   Perhaps if there's a Vol. 2 DVD, it will include the two numbers I've sited above as well as other remarkable numbers that were left off of this set.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I'd been looking and hoping for a new Loreena McKennitt CD for years. I'd given up hope. Stopped looking...<br /><br />Then -- there in The Lyric (the Baltimore opera house) -- Loreena McKennitt on tour! First I bought the tickets. Then I bought AN ANCIENT MUSE.<br /><br />Having moved on from my \\"new age\\" phase of some years back my head's been in different musical spaces: serious/wondrous jazz, guitar virtuosos, classical music... So when MUSE arrived... I was in the wrong \\"gear\\"...<br /><br />But with a concert fast approaching I had to find the set list, compile my own iTunes version of the concert, \\"get ready.\\" And what a world Loreena McKennitt weaves! Ahh... I'd forgotten...<br /><br />MUSE has been on repeat all afternoon as I worked and thought about what to say. (Ahh... I'd forgotten...)<br /><br />Once you're in the right musical head space -- world music not jazz, poems set to music not motif development upon development, etc. -- Loreena McKennitt stirs the heart like few others. For me it's her voice, the courage to set long poems to music, the richness of the instrumental sounds... and did I mention her voice?<br /><br />Having devoured her earlier CDs -- I've got them all! -- I feel confident when I say AN ANCIENT MUSE is right up there with the best of them!<br /><br />Enjoy... and feast your ears!<br /><br />Dr. Kirtland C Peterson

B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|I've read all of Robert B. Parker's Spenser books, and then my ladyfriend picked me up one of his Sunny Randall books - mistakenly thinking that's what I liked.  I'd actually been getting a little tired of the Spenser books as I think the basic concept's getting a little dated - really, who would actually answer to the name \\"Hawk?\\"  I didn't much care for Sunny Randal either - but Jesse Stone made an appearance in the book.  Here, I thought, was a character with some depth.  Moving through his life trying to adhere to a set of principles values while, at the same time, also struggling with his inner demons - now that's a flawed hero I can identify with.  I found \\"Death in Paradise\\" at my local Blockbuster, loved it, and have since bought it, this one, and \\"Night Passage\\" - and loved them all.  I think Tom Selleck did a much better job in these movies than he ever did in his 'Magnum PI' series.  I'm also anxiously awaiting the DVD release of \\"Sea Chase,\\" having missed it's television airing.  The only reason I rated this, and the other two movies four stars instead of five was because of some continuity flaws from movie to movie.
0553804367|4.0|For as simple as Hawking was supposed to present the complicated theoretical physics concepts, at times I still found myself as confused as Adam on Mother's Day.  Dr. Hawking's work is caught between a rock and a hard place in \\"A Brief History of Time\\" and the subsequent \\"The Universe in a Nutshell\\"; he provides neither the technical language to satisfy the experienced readers, nor the sufficiently simplified rhetoric to appeal to the uninitiated.  Not to worry as the theories and supporting arguments in both books can still satisfy the curiosity of the inexperienced, and his celebrity status in the world of physics keeps the experienced audience engaged.    There is one update to this book not mentioned, and that is, Hawking eventually admits that he was wrong about his theory of loss of information in black holes.  This idea of his had put him at odds with many theoretical physicists.  Instead, he puts forth the unproven theory that information in a black hole is transferred to a parallel universe.  Unfortunately, time may not permit Hawking to complete his work on the proof or supporting evidence of this important theory.  His terminal illness appears to be finally catching up to him.  I wish him well and thank him for his important contributions to the science of understanding the universe.    Despite its shortcomings, A Brief History of Time succeeds in shedding light on the mysteries of the creation of the universe at the point of singularity, what happened subsequently, and what may or may not transpire in the future.  Hawking discusses in length Einstein's general theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and the attempt to combine these into a grand unified theory, a lofty goal that has eluded theoretical physicists to date.

B000TGQDZQ|5.0|This release has put Epica into it's own.  This is one polished piece.  The vocals, supported by tight bass, rhythm, guitar, and orchestral highlights puts the listener into an adrenaline soaring, head banging, yet refined euphoric state.  I did not think it was possible to mix dark metal, classic vocals, theatric orchestration, and synthesizers together with success.  I have been proven wrong.  I have been blasting this CD with my with my windows down for a month now.  More than once I have been asked \\"who is that?\\" by an instant Epica fan.  I just hope the band recognizes what an achievement they have done with this release and will continue to evolve this creative style.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I loved this movie!  I felt as though I was watching a movie about myself half the time!  I mean come on, Stuntman Mike is so much like the character I portray in real life it's downright uncanny.  He's a former Stuntman, I'm a former Stuntman for Universal Studios Hollywood (early 70's).  He's got a muscle car, I've got a muscle car.  He's got a skull & crossbones on his car, I've got a skull & crossbones on my car.  He wears cool shades, I wear cool shades.  He enjoys his road rage antics, I enjoy my road rage antics (However I haven't killed anyone out on the streets as of yet) Nor do I plan to so I'll have to draw the line there.  Yeah, I'm a Kurt Russell fan, I like his look in this movie because it reminds me so much of myself.  This movie really captures that 70's B movie drive-in theater look, awesome!  I laughed my proverbial buttocks off during the entire affair!  The Stuntman Mike character is my new anti-hero!  All the chicks looked great in this movie, and they all acted great too.  Top notch stuff.  If you didn't like the movie, and if you don't agree with this review I have only one thing to say \\"You really need to be sitting where I'm sitting in order to understand and get the full benefit of how great this movie is!\\"  :)  VROOM VROOM!

B000AYEL6U|2.0|After reading the novel and greatly enjoying the story and characters, I was excited to find that there was a BBC production. It was extremely disappointing, however, when I realized that great liberties were taken with the plot. Many scenes are placed in completely different settings; many of the important philosophical dialogs are omitted; Nicholas Higgins is portrayed as much more refined and good-natured than in the novel; the final scene with Margaret and Mr. Thornton would have been much less Hollywood-like had the film faithfully followed the novel; and the list goes on. The one part of the movie that I actually did love, though, was Richard Armitage's portrayal of Mr. Thornton. It was on par with Colin Firth's amazing representation of Mr. Darcy in the Pride and Prejudice BBC production. Overall I think this film adaptation was disappointing, which is almost entirely due to its failure to accurately represent the novel. Had I not read the novel first, I probably would have enjoyed the movie much more.
0307387178|4.0|I finished the book last night and had the same reaction as reviewer \\"CJ\\". The side stories were unnecessary and completely halted the pace of the book. Krakauer is an excellent writer, and I loved Into Thin Air, but I thought he over-identified with his subject and lacked objectivity.<br /><br />We are presented this journey as a male rite of passage--young man from privileged background hears the call of the wild and must go off in search of his soul. Krakauer weaves his own experiences as an adventuresome young man through the book and while that's interesting, it also makes it hard to tell whether he's defending/explaining Chris or his own youthful self. He seemed to see Chris as some great mythic figure that cast a woo-woo spell over every person he encountered. This characterization seems a bit odd and forced, because I thought Chris came off pretty clearly as a bright, intense, but troubled young kid.<br /><br />Krakauer spends much time defending Chris. He defends Chris from the Alaskans who (quite reasonably) thought his ill-fated journey was reckless and arrogant. He also finds the need to repeatedly assure us that Chris wasn't gay, although he had no female lovers. Well, fine, whatever works (if the character of Ron Franz wasn't in love with Chris, then I don't know what you'd call it). And finally, in an incident that throws the whole sad episode a bit off-kilter, near the end of the story it is mentioned almost in passing that three remote Alaskan cabins near the area Chris occupied were severely vandalized and nearly destroyed during the time Chris was bus camping nearby. At least one of the cabin owners believes the vandal was Chris. Was Chris a very special heroic figure on a brave and manly spiritual quest, or an intelligent and likable but confused adolescent, or both? We report, you decide. I give it four stars because it's an interesting story and Krakauer is a fine writer.

0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's new book, \\"The Shock Doctrine\\", revisits the past thirty years of world history to argue that capital, large and small, has developed a set of techniques for exploiting disasters to pull off power grabs.  She identifies Milton Friedman, University of Chicago economist, Nobel award winner, and militant \\"free market\\" crusader, as the intellectual mentor of today's neoconservatives and privatizers.  Their argument, that free markets and democracy go together, is painstakingly dissected and refuted by Klein's analysis.      Her conclusion is that free markets are fundamentally incompatible with democracy.    \\"Free markets\\", as implemented in today's world, mean people are not allowed to use government to take care of one another's needs.  Nothing can be done unless a capitalist enterprise is doing it for a profit.  All restrictions on capital - minimum wages, safety standards, union contracts and the rest - are done away with.  The public sector - schools, utilities, transportation and the rest - is handed off to private ownership, often for free, or at least at fire-sale prices.  The social contract - social security, medical systems and the rest - is destroyed.  The cost of labor is driven down to bare subsistence, millions of people lose their homes and livelihoods, and they pile up in slums and shantytowns.      Naturally, these wrenching changes are not adopted democratically.  It is no accident that this kind of \\"freedom\\" so often arrives in a hail of bullets, as in Pinochet's Chile in 1973, or behind battalions of riot police, as in Thatcher's Britain ten years later, or in the wake of economic collapse and foreign invasion, as in Iraq today.      In the ongoing struggle, capital and the governments that support it have learned to take advantage of shocks, like coups, hyperinflation, debt crises, natural disasters like the Asian tsunami of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina, or terrorist attacks like 9/11, to push through this kind of \\"reform\\".  Hence the term \\"disaster capitalism\\"      \\"Free markets\\", in Klein's analysis, are a coded way of saying that capital gets to treat the rest of us any way it wants.  It means freedom for capital and poverty for society.  She quotes Uruguayan author Eduardo Galeano: \\"People were in prison so that prices could be free\\".  Iraq may be a bloody mess, but Halliburton and its ilk are doing very well there.    It is not a coincidence that the governments that practice these policies most enthusiastically are the most likely to arrest and torture masses of their opponents.  Nor is it a coincidence that, once these dictatorships are overthrown, the people promptly elect representatives who try to resist and undo these policies, as in Latin America today.  The neoliberal agenda offers nothing but suffering to most people, so it is no surprise that its projects tend to break down over time.  Its most ill-considered efforts, like Bush's Iraq war, wind up making global capital less secure than it was before.    As Klein points out, shock will eventually wear off.    I recommend this book very highly.  It is one of a very few books that illuminate our modern age.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Yes, I LOVE Interpol, and I'm not ashamed. I can listen to their CD's from beginning to end, with a smile on my face and my head held high.  Their sound is exciting and new, considering what we've had to endure for the past 25 years...I recommend to anyone who wants some fun music to drive to, and music thats sound takes you back.  In itself, it is of value, not only because it reminds me of the past.
B00005JPFH|5.0|I know this is a rather unpopular opinion, but I loved this movie--it was my favorite of the trilogy. I aknowledge that it did have its' problems--too many subplots, too many villains, too much silliness from Peter, too much whining from Mary Jane.  On the other hand--what worked, really did work.  Bryce Dallas Howard was wonderful, the Sandman rocked, and the special effects were fab. By far, though, what really made this movie for me was the buddy aspect between Peter and his best friend turned villain, Harry Osborn.  James Franco has really come into his own as an actor, and the transformation he undergoes in the film, from spoiled rich boy to gentleman and friend to New Goblin to redeemed tragic hero, was unexpected and skillfully executed.

0192802380|5.0|Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero.  None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.<br />  The main characters are:<br />The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.<br />Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.<br />Jane Bennet is the oldest \\"Miss Bennet\\". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.<br />Elizabeth Bennet is the novel's heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.<br />Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.<br />Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.<br />Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.<br />Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.<br />Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.<br />Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.<br />Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy's aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.<br />  The novel was written during the period of England's life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation's affairs<br />Austen keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.<br />  Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author. No wonder this is true! Janeites have adored her beautiful writing and well crafted stories for generations! Enjoy!.<br />Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth.

0805053883|5.0|My girls and I so enjoy reading the other book in the series, \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see?\\".  My twin girls are 2 and they would actually sit with the other book and read it to out loud to each other, so it was a great find to have another book in the series for us to read, the illustrations are colorful and a great book to learn new vocabulary words.
0307277887|4.0|After ordering the book, I learned that it has been made into a TV series, and one review of the TV show mentioned that it kept to the book's descriptions of graphic violence. I was worried that the book would be too graphic for my taste, but the author doesn't really make the killing scenes too horrific. The main character is quite unique to the mystery genre, and the author's development of the supporting characters is also entertaining. I enjoyed the story quite a bit.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Well, this would be the first review I've ever put on here only because I just felt so compelled after listening to this CD a few times.    I have never... and I mean never... had a CD affect me in the way that this one has. Coupled with the book for this that I just finished, I'm left with a feeling of overwhelming emotions that range fro sadness to disgust to relief. I lived my teen years through the heyday of Motley Crue and have to honestly say that I admired and idolized them back then for all of the wrong reasons. Now I can say I admire Nikki Sixx for all of the RIGHT reasons.    This CD is a whirlwind tour of the hell and depths that he went to with his addictions. Don't be fooled. Although heroin was what he had the worst of his times with, he was a garbage head and put everything into his system that he came across. You can -feel- this in these songs.    I'm not going to detail every song but talk about what I thought were the most powerful of them. All of the tracks on this CD are beautiful and tragic but these just stood out to me.    \\"X-Mas in Hell\\" is just a simple introduction with spoken word and a twisted Christmas carol that really sets the mood for what's to come.    \\"Van Nuys\\" is just an unbelievably powerful song that draws you into his heroin den immediately and gives you the feeling of how tortured he was right away. The vocals and bass line in this song suck you right in.    \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is his coming through the other side. Call it preachy if you want but it's meaning is to say that you need to go through all of the bad times in your life to truly enjoy the good times. The song itself is a wonderfully powerful arrangement.     \\"Accidents Can Happen\\" is a fantastic ballad about relapse and the fact that it doesn't have to be the end of the world unless you allow it to. This is the closest song on the CD to a \\"power ballad\\" and James Michaels' vocals are probably at their best on this song. It showcases his range, his talent, and his ability to bring emotion across.    \\"Girl With Golden Eyes\\" is the love song on this CD. The only difference is that this love song isn't dedicated to any woman. It's dedicated to what his true love was and that was heroin. He likens it to being so in love with a woman that he found comfort and ease in the arms of his \\"lover\\".    All in all, this CD is probably the best I have heard in -ages- and I would have paid twice what I did for it. Nikki's songwriting is the best I have ever heard from him and the best I have heard from almost anyone. It's one thing to hear a song that you can relate to. It's another when a song sucks you in and doesn't let you go and that's exactly what's Nikki's songwriting does on this CD. Michaels' vocals are truly chameleon-like and fit each and every song perfectly. DJ Ashba's guitarwork is a thing to behold as well.    In closing, this is easily the best and most gratifying CD I have bought in years. And make sure to pick up the book as well. As unbelievable as this CD is, the book is even better.    -Jeff Gish
0375836675|4.0|Though many people dislike the book's ending, I found it quite fitting.  Zusak inspires readers with his creation of an ordinary hero.  Ed motivates adults and teens alike to save the world.  Just as Ed receives minimal information outlining his mission, we too must emerge from our lives of self-absorption and extend ourselves.      How does Ed save others?  He watches, waits, and delivers.  Though the action may be small, the kindness is powerful.  This taxi-driving youth's understanding of people's needs is astounding.  Telling a young runner she possesses beauty.  Bringing an old woman a past love.  Reuniting a friend with his lost child.  And, ultimately, giving himself the greatest gift of all.       This book is a fast read, not only because of the simple writing style, but also because of my lack of patience in awaiting Ed's next mission.  Few can read this book and not be encouraged to create their own lives full of LIFE.
B000SZLSB2|1.0|James Blunt's second release was arguably one of the most disappointing follow-up albums in modern rock history.     All the Lost Souls left me confused, irritated and frustrated. It reeks of minuscule musical talent and over-urgency.    Half of the songs repeat one lyrical sentence without musical diversity.    An unfortunate waste of subconscious musical intellect.
1594489505|5.0|Unlike many who read the book, I don't see the need to compare this to the Kite Runner.  I've been to Afghanistan a few times and have worked with the locals quite a bit, and many of the tragic scenes Hosseini paints are (unfortunately) accurate.  I think this is a must read for westerners for several reasons.  For pluralists and liberals who are under the impression that we can somehow just 'get along' with the disciples of radical Islam, read this book and get a glimpse of the life of women in Afghanistan.  As a health care provider I've treated many of them, and could add many experiences worse than those painted here, but I don't have Mr. Hosseini's gift.  This book also gives insight to what the people here have endured over the past 40-50 years.  I believe it is a must read for soldiers and aid workers alike.  It is difficult to relate to the people of Afghanistan, especially those who live in very remote areas.  However, this book helps give a little perspective as to what many endure, and a woman in Afghanistan potentially endures the most miserable existence imaginable.  In my opinion, if you do not walk away from this book with genuine sorrow in your heart for the people of Afghanistan (especially if you work with them), there must be something wrong with you.  And for those who want to run away from the conflict with pan-Islamic Jihad, read it and get a clue.  But beyond the historical reflection, I think it is also a beautiful story of love, courage and how devoted friends can be to each other.
B000N3STBQ|5.0|Black Celebration is the culmination, in this author's opinion, of all of themes of love, depression, darkness, loneliness and otherwise alienation that Depeche Mode could have possibly enumerated on. From the start, with the punching keyboards and bass line, the album begins to envelope you in it its \\"darkness.\\" What is so stunning about the \\"black\\" nature of it is that it's really not that frightening as the title makes out. Sure, it's not an album \\"for the masses\\" as others were, but it touches on subject matter that would affect even the most mildly emotional person. The start of the album, \\"Black Celebration\\", which finishes with \\"A Question of Lust\\" is one of the best Depeche Mode uninterrupted segments I have ever heard. As I said it was Depeche Mode, I would say that it is the best regarding any album I've heard. Granted, my taste is quite narrow (late 70s through the 80s and a few 90s to modern bands - very few), but I deeply feel this is the best. Perhaps it speaks to my feelings about relationships, life and interpersonal business better than other albums do. For some people, that's a massive turnoff and they want nothing to do with it. For Mr. and Mrs. Lonely Heart, this album is your ticket to relief - at least for the evening.    The songs of the album are generally introspective, romantic and otherwise personal. They deal with relationships, unrequited love, immoral (stachatory) love and finally public infatuation. For the most part, it is a romantic album. Not in the beautiful, flower oriented and otherwise idealistic romantic notion. Rather, it is love that is difficult, upsetting and painful. I find it cathartic. Perhaps that is its biggest downfall; you might require a certain mindset to appreciate all of the nuances and pain that is laced throughout its eleven tracks.    Regardless, I think it is a beautiful album that any synth fan should own. Also, anyone who is perhaps suffering from unrequited love should listen as well. Per the remaster, itis incredibly well down. Simon Heyworth is no slouch. The gentleman has perfected his technique especially with SACD (only available on import editions) but even with remasters. He knows not to maximise and consequently make albums as loud as possible. The disc is tastefully done in a fashion that is \\"loud\\" enough for today's market without being offensively so. I strongly encourage all to order the European import edition as it is a Super Audio CD. The price is prohibitive, I admit. But if you ever own a 5.1 multi channel system with SACD, you will discover the beauty of Mr. Heyworth's remixes. Not only do you get the stereo mix in an uncompressed fashion, but you get a 5.1 one mix (much like any modern film mix in five channels),  as well as having been overseen by Alan Wilder (in the band until 1995) and given his consent. I love SACD and thus own the import editions myself. I have the privilege of owning SACD compatible hardware. Even if you don't have the hardware, SACD allows you to listen like a regular CD and if you get the hardware one day, you'll be able to enjoy! So you win either way. Enjoy. Depeche Mode creates beautiful music.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|This sweeper can only pick up a little bit of dust and dirt at a time.  The area containing the dirt is no bigger than a deck of cards.  That means that if you have pet hair, you can only make a swipe or two before it is full and you need to empty it.    It may just be me, but I expected this to have some suction or something. It does not.  The battery powers the brushes and that is all.    I didn't feel that it picked up well and I was just using it to run over our hard wood floors each night.    I ended up returning the item.  I thought it was junk.
0805079831|5.0|My copy was barely delivered yesterday, and I slept last night, so I haven't finished it.  That will come soon, though.    This is an expose of the evil that is the modern American policies.  The descriptions of how torture is used in implementing radical economic change are enough to make you feel sick to your stomach.  The author tries hard to expose what goes on underneath the friendly veneer of public policy and shows that history is repeating itself.  The people the CIA tortured in MKUltra were just guinea pigs for the people that the US Government is torturing now.  The people of Chile, who had their government overthrown  by US influence and support, were just guinea pigs for the people that the United States is currently overthrowing and democratizing.  And it just goes on and on, as if there is a never ending spigot of evil that is washing over the world.    I find this to be an altogether frightening look at the world today, and it makes me even more ashamed to be a citizen of the United States of America.  Everyone should read this book.
0316010669|3.0|The premise IS interesting. The process is not. Author relates one study after another, after another, after another. These articles are meant to establish that we know what we know instinctively.    The big turnoff in this book was the author's heavy racial bias.

1426458975|2.0|Chesterton no doubt was a brilliant man! In Orthodoxy he does not write for the common person, but for philosophers and intellectuals who enjoy such semantics. I had wished he had expressed his ideas more simply: i.e. in parables and analogies, like his Lord did, but such is very hard to do! As a preacher of the gospel I was disappointed with much of the book for this reason.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|This release is garbage.  Seems like AFI peaked with Black Sails in the Sunset and Art of Drowning.  Sing the Sorrow had a few good songs, but overall marked a turn for the worse.  Now this Decemberunderground is just totally garbage.  And to think AFI was my favorite band at one time... neveragain.
1416500294|5.0|RL Stevenson was born in 1850, and died in 1894. \\"Treasure Island\\" was first published in 1883, though was originally written for the amusement of Stevenson's stepson, Lloyd Osbourne.    Set in the 1700s, the book's hero is Jim Hawkins. Jim is, apparently, an only child whose parents run the Admiral Benbow - a quiet inn, though with a good reputation, not far from Bristol. His troubles begin with the arrival of a mysterious sailor - a rather intimidating, poorly dressed and generally filthy character, though not one who was short of money. He's reluctant to give his name, though claims to hold the rank of captain, and he generally says little. However, occasionally his tongue is loosened a little by his fondness for rum - upon which he would either burst into song or tell the most terrifying stories. At the mysterious sailor's request, meanwhile, Jim keeps an eye out for another salty old sea dog the nameless captain seems keen to avoid : the unwanted visitor's most notable feature is his one leg.    Things change with the arrival of an even nastier sailor named Black Dog. He's obviously acquainted with the Admiral Benbow's resident sailor - whose name, Billy Bones, is soon revealed - though they're not on the best of terms. Things turn nasty, one thing leads to another and before you can say \\"oh, arrr\\", Billy has died of a stroke. Jim and his mother quickly rifle Billy's sea chest - he'd left a substantial bar bill, and Mrs Hawkins meant to collect payment - though among his possessions they also find a mysterious sealed packet. When eventually opened, the packet proves to hold treasure map of a notorious pirate called Captain Flint. Shortly afterwards, Jim joins Squire Trelawney and Dr Livesey on a mission to retrieve the treasure. Unfortunately, their ship proves to be manned by a crew of treacherous pirates - including the one-legged Long John Silver...    A very easily read, fast-moving and enjoyable book - and one that (presumably) has had a huge impact on howwe still see pirates : lots of songs about rum (naturally with a few yo-ho-hos thrown in), treasure maps where X marks the spot and one-legged salty old sea dogs with parrots that scream \\"pieces of eight\\". Highly recommended.

B000B8QG22|4.0|Set during the vietnam war, Williams is a private who's job is a DJ for the base radio station.  He brings his own brand of humor and music to the station, which the troops in the field are thoroughly enjoy; however, his immediate superioirs are against it.  Good personal interaction story, many subplots, Williams humor is fantastic!  You will enjoy the show!
0060512806|5.0|there is a great, if challenging, book on codes and code breaking, Cryptonomicon, by Neal Stephenson. The Nazi's had the supposedly unbreakable code, generated by the Enigma machine. To make a long story short, The English broke the code using the newly created first computers. Alan Turing. The Allies could now, unbeknownst to the Germans and Japanese, decipher their messages. They discovered that many Japanese boats were in Truk, (Chuuk)which is shaped like a horseshoe. They sent bombers way way south west and bombed the entrance to Truk and then leisurely sank the rest of the boats.<br /><br />Truc Lagoon is now a scuba dive destination, boats, coral, skeletons and sake bottles inside the portholes.<br /><br />There is this grimly comic story in the book where Japanese Adm. Yamamoto, arguably the best mind in the Japanese military, is flying in the south Pacific and he is thinking, how can the Americans always be in the right place all the time? Midway? Gaudalcanal? Then he suddenly realizes they have must have broken the Enigma code! Just then an American fighter comes out of the sun (Allies knew where Yamamoto's plane was expected to be, too), before Yamamoto can radio anyone and shoots his plane down. True story (the mental dialog is conjecture of course).<br /><br />two stories (and plot lines) in one, which reflect each other.<br /> yeah it's too long and needs and editor, but I still think it is<br /><br />Highly recommended

0743243153|5.0|I had to write a quick review simply because the one that shows first is so negative. This is my favorite book. The writer below seems to be inferring things from the book that I never did... I completely disagree with the author of the last comment. I do not think Peck is endorsing religion, but rather spirituality, but if you get yours from religion, so be it. Why was he so shocked about the patient and sex comment?.... I am not going to even expand on each aspect of his comment... it would just be a jumbled mess...  I recommend this book to anyone. It reveals universal truths and every line... almost every line rings true to me and to many, many people. I understand, after reading the last comment, that it may fly in the face of what is generally accepted by the field (when necessary)... just my kind of book.
B000P2A256|4.0|This album is not a progression from their previous, its more of an extention.  Be that as it may, i emjoyed the last album and i enjoyed this album, so they made me happy and got me to part with hard earned cash to buy this album.  WELL DONE!!
B000CFLFX4|4.0|I've been using my Swivel Sweeper daily for almost a year now, and it still works very well. The keys to that success are that 1) I never charge the battery more than 6-8 hours; 2) I charge it only when it starts to run down, and 3) I don't slam the sweeper around. As I said in a review elsewhere, this is not a $600 built-like-a-tank Electrolux. If you abuse it, it will break. But if you treat it with reasonable care, it'll keep working for a long time. After ten months of use, I still love my Swivel Sweeper!
B000SZLSB2|4.0|James Blunt had a difficult task at trying to match the sucess of his previos album, but i think he has achieved his aim on this album.

1596912855|2.0|I unashamedly adore all of Shannon Hale's previous books. Everything from Goose Girl to Princess Academy. Unfortunatly this book falls short of the high bar she set with her YA work.  The main character is slightly annoying and definitely not as funny as others books of this same style. I thought the premise of the story was great, but the plot and scenes were somehow lacking strength and realism. Perhaps I would have liked it better if I'd read all of Jane Austen's works multiple times rather than just having read the majority of them once.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|As much as I hate when studios yank every hard-earned penny from us with version after version of movies in this instance I will forgive them.  I was very disappointed when Serenity did not have a 2-disc version when it was first released and I am glad to see the treatment now.  If nothing else it shows that this property has made money for Universal and I will keep my fingers crossed that it will lead to a sequel.  But if not, well I will always enjoy my Collector's Edition with a great DTS audio track and great extras (I especially love the R. Tam Sessions, a low budget but brilliant look at River's character).  As rough as the road of Firefly/Serenity has been, at least we have what we have, we're still flying, and sometimes that's enough.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, the second film that played after Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror as part of the original theatrical Grindhouse feature, is a brilliant homage and twisted trip to say the least.  Kurt Russell (in a role originally slated for Mickey Rourke) plays the psychotic Stuntman Mike, who doesn't kill his victims with a gun or a knife like a typical serial killer would, but instead he uses his souped up muscle car to stalk and murder his prey, and he does it quite well.  All goes great for Mike until he comes across the wrong group of girls (including Rosario Dawson and stuntwoman Zoe Bell in her acting debut) who strike back in a big way.  While Death Proof is pure Tarantino all the way (the dialogue is top notch and instantly memorable), it's the car crash and chase scenes that are what's worth noting the most.  With some incredible stunt work at his disposal, Tarantino crafts the trashy homage he set out to do, and he does it perfectly.  Also featuring Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Hostel director Eli Roth, and the incredibly hot Vanessa Ferlito.  On a side note, you'll no doubt notice that the negative reviews here are due to the fact that Death Proof and Planet Terror are not being released together on DVD as they were in theaters.  It's a crying shame that this has happened, because this isn't what Tarantino or Rodriguez wanted.  The whole point of Grindhouse was getting two movies for the price of one, and the fake trailers sprinkled before and in between (directed by Roth, Rob Zombie, Rodriguez, and Edgar Wright) are nowhere in sight.  Whether you purchase them both seperately is up to you, but it's inevitable that further down the line both films will be packaged together with the trailers included.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|. . .\\"Greed is good.\\"  And the Brothers' Weinstein know it by heart.  The double feature tanked in the theaters because Miramax didn't take the time to educate the general public as to the delight these films were.  After the first week, Harvey & Bob were whining to the press, already talking about how they were going to pull it and re-release them separately.  Good press and patience would have made this incredible piece of film making a hit.  So now they have their chance to release the films separately and see that the die hard film geeks will wait.  Patience will win out and greed will get the best of them - this will be released as shown, eventually, and I am willing to wait.  When will the home video arm of the studios realize that fans want extras, original material, that little extra something?

I saw his concert in Sydney without having heard \\"Modern Times\\". Now I wish I was back there with the knowledge of these newer songs. I listened to the preview songs on Amazon and just had to get the CD immediately - which is pretty much how Amazon dispatches their CDs - even to Australia. Forget the \\"4-6 weeks\\" - I always get deliveries within 10 days, and usually cheaper than if I had time to trawl the shops here. I love the way you can listen, then buy, online. It's another life since I had to wait for the latest vinyl album to arrive from overseas! Thanks, younger generation! hehehe

B000GIWRIY|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - After nearly 5 years of touring and compiling, Jethro Tull continued their brilliant career with an stunning musical top return, the 1995 Roots To Branches. Following the acclaimed Catfish Rising, Roots To Branches is definitively one of their top most exentric, intriguing albums, much more consistent and cohersive, the album possesses a wide variety of moods and styles, with their very best significant touch of world music, it may stand as their closest to metal (of course, not a metal album but it gets closer than Crest Of A Knave!), and it may be their best album when it comes to its poetic, coherent lyrics and focused themes. Roots To Branches assumes throughout its songs some of their greatest recalls onto their early '70s music, while still a shadow of their early works, Roots To Branches is completely consistent and it may stand better as some of their '70s works. It possesses a wide open range of moods, styles and atmospheres, but its most intriguing details are the album's most present arabic, saharian, middle east style definitively much more better presented in the completely correct stylish, arabic, foreign flavoured \\"Rare And Precious Chain\\", while this is even present in the fierceful brutality of the opening title track \\"Roots To Branches\\". This 'pervasive' pattern of arabic-style rock is present until the 7th track, and most of the songs in this mood are notorious attention keepers and they can even stand as really memorable songs, some sudden turns and twists onto their early, more catchy fashion can be identified on \\"Out Of The Noise\\" and the least \\"Valley\\", but even though this foreign, arabic presentation is fabulous and very enjoyable, the songs' music capture a strong style, but its still notorious that the songs could've been kept as normal songs without this, I mean, there isn't present a strong, recognizable theme around the songs' mood, so this may stand quite dissapointing, the only song that assumes a superb musicianship mixed with a recognizable theme is the memorable, long lasting, notorious \\"Beside Myself\\", which talks about certain Middle East facts and sights.<br /><br />Entering aside the first 7 tracks, the next 4 songs are much more of truly recognizable styles around Jethro Tull's early styles, each of them have its own unique recalling style and fashion, though this affects the album's cohersion and it seems each of this songs coud've been released at any time, separated, on any album. This last 4 songs of course they will be much more appreciated by long lasting fans, swinging from many of their roots, \\"Wounded, Old And Treacherous\\" even recalls their very first jazzy roots onto the album This Was, is quite talented, while \\"At Last, Forever\\" keeps their more firm progressive rock interests onto Thick As A Brick and A Passion Play, this is one of their most wonderful songs they've made, it seems more like a Thick As A Brick fragment, mixing blues rock with prog rock features and quite confusing romantic themes. \\"Stuck In The August Rain\\" is the most beautiful and melodic song in the album, its tender, sensitive style make it a really beautiful composition, maybe their only one that could stand as soft rock, so don't miss it, while the final \\"Another Harry's Bar\\" keeps a comfortable bluesy style with some late Rock Island/Catfish Rising moods. All in all, Roots To Branches point is quite confusing but very solid, for casual listeners is one perfect album because its fierceful, attractive rock style and present exentric moods with a wide variety of their early styles, and for long time fans this is even better because it recalls a recognizable number of their early styles with some top class original, exentric material best shown in the first 7 songs, so if you are expecting a slight revival of their classic roots, mixed with fierceful, potential and original material, plus an stunning, hard rocking, memorable performance, but you're still in doubt because of its critics and still scared of their mid 80's experimentations, don't doubt on buying Roots To Branches, as it is pleasing in a number of senses. [this remastered edition has a fantastic sound quality although it does not possess bonus tracks].l scared of their mid 80's experimentations, don't doubt on buying Roots To Branches, as it is pleasing in a number of senses.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|Love this CD.  After I saw the movie I had to have it. Music is great.  You can feel the emotion in each song.  Glen Hansard and and Marketa Irglova's voices together are beautiful. It was great to be introduced to two young singers I knew nothing about.  I play the CD all the time in my car and never get tired of it.
B000OYC7A8|3.0|I absolutely love Pink Floyd and all of their fine DVDs and albums, but this item was a bit of a disappointment for me, all because of the heavy use of smoke, color, and bright lights that washed away my ability to get a clear view of the musicians' performances.  The horrible use of excessive lights and smoke simply ruined it for me.  The tags on the package emphasized the use of HD cameras for the video - I don't know why they even bothered.    If you can \\"look past\\" the shoddy video, the audio & overall concert performance is very good.    But if great video is important, pass this one up and get \\"David Gilmour in Concert\\" or \\"Pulse\\" instead.
0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read.  If you have not read this then you have to get this book right away.  This book will keep you reading for hours, as you read unexpected twists in it.  Percy goes on adventures with his other half-blood friends and every one is very interesting.  So, if you are looking for a book to read, then this is definitely one that you have to read.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Eddie could sing \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\" and it would be perfect.  In the 12 years that I've been a PJ fan, there isn't any song I've heard him sing that isn't brillantly done (even when the particular song hasn't been that great). This CD showcases his song writing and vocal talents so simply done, yet so powerful and moving. Can'd decide which song I like the most. They all speak in different ways.  Thanks Eddie for sharing your awe inspiring talents with us. We are so not worthy. :-)    CD con:  33 minutes is way too short!  We want more!!!
0385338902|3.0|Ever since I read Plan B, Jonathan Tropper's first novel, I've thought he is a writer who's going places. I've read every one of his books and was happy for him when I heard that How to Talk to a Widower (under its previous title, About Hailey, which I think is much better than the current one) had been sold to a movie studio for a million dollars.  I looked forward to reading his latest novel, but I'm sorry to say I was a little disappointed.    No, this is not a bad book by any means. In some ways, it's vintage Tropper, full of his dysfunctional characters: boys trapped in men's bodies who, for some reason, you can't help but sympathize with. But in other ways, I felt Tropper lowered his standards to those of Hollywood. There are parts of the book that feel as if they were written with a movie in mind--and others (like the ridiculous scene at the ob/gyn) that belong in a bad sitcom. The only thing missing is the laugh track.     I do look forward to reading Tropper's next book. I just hope he doesn't end up selling out; he's much too talented for that.
B00005ASOI|5.0|The biggest complaints about this film I hear are the dubbings, the over-the-topness of the violence and just how old the movie is on the whole and how it doesn't stand up well in today's movie society.<br /><br />The movie itself is an excellent rendition of a true nightmare, despite what people may say. This is done through the lighting, which gives it the same dream-like feel as the Wizard of Oz...yet it is darker and much more graphic. It also does well in depicting the occult and the ways many in this  field attempt to hide themselves, evil or otherwise (contrary to popular belief, there ARE light witches).<br /><br />The deaths are rather extreme if you can stand to watch them and the story itself is rather creepy, but it's nothing compared to many of the gorefests put out today, it's not extreme by any means.<br /><br />Still an excellent story with the only downside being the flat and rather abrupt ending and the dubbing between the two women right before the first murder scene.  Goblin's music score is EXCELLENT and makes the movie feel just that much creepier.  A must watch.<br /><br />--- 5 out of 5 stars ---
0743454537|5.0|An absolute work of art. I do not understand why people are complaining about the ending. Not every story has a happy ending; which is what makes this novel so riveting. It is based on what can happen in real life. Life is not a fairy tale. The novel is written beautifully and keeps the reader intrigued from the first page to the last.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  NICHOLAS CAGE IS FABULOUS AS USUAL. LOTS OF ACTION, MY KIND OF MOVIE.  I RECOMMEND IT FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE NICHOLAS CAGE AND LIKE SUPERHERO TYPE MOVIES...
B00004TX5F|5.0|Farinelli is an amazing movie, the music, the sets-everything.  It is well written, well acted and beautifully sung.  You don't need to be an opera fan to love this, in fact, if you think you hate opera then see it, I think you will change your mind!
B000002KY8|4.0|Okay, first six tracks? Can't be beat. Three funky, eccentric, quirky, full of Prince's personality, and just plain, flat-out astounding. \\"1999\\", with its \\"apocalyptic dance-party\\" theme; \\"Little Red Corvette\\", an all-out funk-rocker with some infamously foul-mouthed lyrics that is nonetheless impossible to sing along to; \\"Delirious\\" takes \\"Little Red Corvette\\" and adds bits of rockabilly. Then the next three songs totally eschew the traditional extended funk-song formula. They may be enormously long, but all three offer enough weird twists to keep them from getting anywhere near monotonous (\\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\"; \\"D.S.M.R.\\"; \\"Automatic\\"), and all three are also strikingly individual. They don't feel like parts of a three-song suite, they actually stand out on their own. After you get past those three is when things start getting just the smallest bit shaky. I've never cared much for \\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)\\", because I've never liked the squiggly keyboard tone; \\"All the Critics Love U in New York\\" is an attempt at irony that goes off on the wrong foot; and \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" slogs on with no foreseeable end. The good news is that the two ballads near the close are wonderful; the moving \\"Free\\" and the even more emotional \\"International Lover\\". Stick around for those. This was Prince's breakthrough album, and while he's done better (Dirty Mind; Purple Rain and Emancipation come to mind), this is in the first class of his albums just the same.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|5+ stars easily.  A great sci-fi book by P K Dick was turned into a great movie directed by the talented Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, ...)   Harrison Ford is perfect and there are a number of other well-known actors in this such as Rutger Hauer, who is amazing in his role.  I think I read that he came up with part of his closing monologue. The music is by Vangelis.      The tempestuous story of its filming has been documented in books.  I really think that this is a sci-fi movie that can be put on the level of, say, Metropolis in terms of its influence, themes, and being ahead of the curve.  This isn't Wookies or Jar-Jar (Lucas' closest film to this was THX 1138).  This is a man who is starting to wonder what separates him from the humanoids he is supposed to \\"retire\\".      About the book vs the movie-- I think Dick's writing can be very uneven  but this novel is first class.  While remaining largely faithful to the book, the movie does simplify things a bit by leaving off some of the book's religious/psychological themes.  There's a religion called Mercerism in the book that is based on empathy, and people have a fetish about owning live animals although mostly only replicants are available.  (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?)  People also frequently use a Mood Organ to give themselves synthetic happiness - in the novel, Decker's  wife is in a haze.
B00005JLMH|5.0|Ridley Scott, who also directed Blade Runner and Gladiator, had an equally impressive take on the great Columbus.  Columbus was really a great mariner and that is all; the movie shows this richly, as he is at a loss amidst the political infighting in Spain and later in the colonies.  Tapped to be the first governor of Hispanola(now Haiti and the Dominican Republic), he was so inept as to antagonize the native peoples as well as his own fellow Europeans.  The movie captures this with vivid outdoor vistas, driving traditional music, actual natives(brought to the islands from South America for the filming), and the beauty attached to seafaring.  Historically, it is as accurate as Hollywood gets(50%?), which is fine.  This is 500 years ago+, and the history has segued into mythology by now, anyway.    As a history grad, I was fascinated with the university(Salamanca) discussion of the world and the perils of distance.  Far from being wrong as history has tarnished them, listen to the discussion.  To go to Asia as Columbus wanted, they were right and he was wrong; the voyage was far longer than he expected and they could never make it.  However, Columbus stumbled onto a land mass that got in the way, called North America. Fortunate for him as the water and rations could never have made it all the way to the Asian spice islands that he was aiming for...

B000P2A24W|4.0|I would call myself a \\"new\\" Bon Jovi fan.    I am only 20, but I do like to listen to many \\"classic\\" rock songs.    A few days before I purchased 'Lost Highway', I had been listening to some Bon Jovi songs on the internet. I had heard that they were coming out with a new CD and I was interested.    Then I started to listen, to really listen to some songs, such as 'You Give Love a Bad Name', 'Livin' on A Prayer', 'It's My Life', 'Have A Nice Day' and 'Wanted Dead or Alive'.    While out with my friends, I saw this CD and I grabbed it. We listened to it on the way home and I love it.    My favorite track on the CD: '(You Want To) Make A Memory'.
0691126658|4.0|At Last a concise well illustrated easy to manage field guide for bird watchers travelling to East Africa. Previous reviews although excellent are to heavy and bulky for international travellers with serious weight limitations on the luggage they are allowed.  The illustations are excellent and there is adequate factual information and good maps to accompany them.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I watched the first version of this film when it originally came out on dvd and I was not blown away. Few months later I bought this version and I'll tell you it is a world of difference.    So much is added to the story including scenes with the Liam Neeson. It paints a greater picture of the characters and the way they are entangled with each other.    If you like the original version, I highly recommend this version.
B000001A3H|4.0|Kyuss creates music that no one else can duplicate.  It's perfect for those long hot summer days and even better for the humid nights that follow.  Listening to this album makes you want to hop in a convertible and drive through the desert \\"Fear and Loathing Style\\".<br /><br />Kyus has a groove like none other, and here they begin to perfect it.  The openers \\"Thumb\\" and \\"Green Machine\\" rock you hard.  With his tuned down guitar, Josh Homme creates riffs that resemble an egg frying on a driveway.  Songs like \\"50 Million Year Trip\\" and \\"Allen's Wrench\\" rock the same.<br /><br />However, the best song on this album without a doubt is \\"Freedom Run\\" which starts out slow and builds into a smooth riff and jams you into an euphoric oblivion.  The instrumental jams here stand out as well, \\"Caterpillar March\\" has a flow that will have you rocking.<br /><br />Kyuss prefects their sound on their next album, \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\", but this is album is right on that threshold.
B00004W221|5.0|Great story, and true! My kids liked it a lot. There were a few words like S.O.B. thrown in, but it wasn't too much. Teaches some great lessons, such as dedication, respect for others, courage, etc.
B000Q67DEO|5.0|I'm ecstatic that I'm finally able to watch the DVD version of this album without paying exhorbitant online auction prices for the VHS version (note that the prices for those VHS versions have dropped substantially with this DVD release).  One nit: I wish the audio quality of the DVD was as good as the CD. I'm sure it was just transfered from the original master video, so it's a faithful re-release, but how hard would it have been to get the CD audio quality transfered to the video version? Listening to the DVD audio even through an excellent sound system, sounds like you're listening to it through TV speakers. It isn't terrible by any means, but it pales when compared to the CD audio.<br /><br />Otherwise, no complaints. Video quality is excellent, considering the age of the source material, and audio quality of the CD is superb. Easily the best money I've spent all year. A must-have for all Blondie fans.
0805047905|5.0|We bought this for our daughter for her first birthday.  The text is simple, teaching colors and animals.  The illustrations are, of course, beautiful.  She loves this book!
B000002HEP|5.0|The album is an absolute classic.  If you enjoy good music, you NEED this album.  For people who are new to the band, this is the album to start out with.  One of those rare albums that you can throw in and listen all the way through, EVERY time.  I'm not kidding, I feel like I'm cheating myself if I don't listen to it all the way through.  The album is broken into three parts, each feeding off the other.<br /><br />The album starts out with \\"Gardenia\\", a hard rocking tune that breaks into a funky jam halfway through before returning to the original pavement crunching riff that starts the song.  An epic beginning followed by the spacey instrumental jam \\"Asteroid\\" that gets furiously heavy in the end.  \\"Supa Scoop\\" is another that starts heavy, then gets drops out, and into a rich, funky groove that will make your head bounce and your hands grab for your air guitar.  End Part 1<br /><br />\\"100 Degrees\\" rocks hard all the way through.  Enter \\"Space Cadet\\", a trippy acoustic jam unlike any other Kyuss song, and completely wicked. Then comes the epic \\"Demon Cleaner\\", possibly their most recgnized song due to a Tool cover of it floating around on the internet.  Another track a groove that will get you going, the drums here are sweet.  End Part 2<br /><br />\\"Odyssey\\" follows a familiar formula, start heavy, get the funk out, end even heavier. Segue into \\"Conan Troutman\\" which is the shortest, and probably fastest paced song on the album.  \\"N.O.\\" has a different groove entirely, feeling more bluesy than the rest of the album.  Then onto the epic closer, \\"Whitewater\\".  A slow build up to an unforgetable riff, a jam out similar to \\"Gardenia\\", but way different, which drops to a slow and sweet ending.<br /><br />Overall, a masterpiece.  As a matter of fact, writing this has made me want to listen to it right now.  I'm gonna grab some beers, a couple smokes, closes my eyes, crank up the stereo and fade away into sonic euphoria.  Adios.
B00005JO9J|1.0|Yeah, you just have to sit back and scratch you head in awe at the popularity of this visionary abortion, I remember seeing the first previews of this show, and knew it was junk, and I was right, it is just another med show, don't be fooled, and to make it worse there's some kind of humor to it, better shows fell before this one and it goes to show that sometimes viewers like mindless T.V., I try to watch the show, but I can't seem to get past the first few seconds, even the T.V. spots are anguish
B000784WMW|5.0|I've long been a fan of The Bronte sisters and Jane Eyre was always my favorite book.  Its not easy getting a full feel for the book in a movie, without losing important information.  The first version that I remember seeing starred Orson Welles and was an old version.  He did a fantastic job as Rochester but because of the time it was made, it didn't fully express the book.  This version, with Timothy Dalton as Rochester is beyond words.  He plays the role perfectly, showing the dark, broodiness of the character as well as the softer side that truly loves Jane.  His situation is sad as he finds himself in love with his young governess while still married to a woman who isn't in her right mind.  The actress that plays Jane, Zelah Clarke, also does an incredible, believable job.  The book is most completely shown here, from Jane's childhood, to her education and then teaching responsibilities, to becoming the young woman that sees through the cold exterior of her employer.  Truly a fabulous version and a must see for anyone that loves the classics as I do
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Now that Tony and Carmela have shared their last dish of ziti, the title of television's finest hour flips to Showtime's Dexter, a remarkable dissection (pun intended) of America's first serial killer crime fighter.      The twelve episode first season provides the most intriguing television in years, with the beguiling Dexter as mesmerizing to audiences as he is deadly to his victims.       To summarize the story, I'll explain the three references in my title...    CSI: Miami - Dexter works as a blood-splatter analyst in Miami's forensics crime unit.   The episodes provide the same graphic crimes and creative plots that attract viewers to the forensics shows on broadcast television.  Fans of David Caruso's pretentiousness and exaggerated emotional response will be disappointed in Michael C. Hall, however...because he can actually act.  His sly smile, his charm, his wit.  All hook viewers immediately.   But even though Dex is the kind of guy everyone seeks out when in need, we know his true essence is different.      American Psycho - Beneath his nice guy image lurks a soulless killer, a monster lacking basic human emotions.  While investigating crimes, he is unaffected by horrific murder scenes, sometimes even bedazzled by the creativity of killers while standing next to pools of blood and sliced-up corpses.    He also has an unquenchable thirst to end human lives, dissect bodies and keep a blood drop souvenir of his activities.  Dexter is upper middle class, mid 30s, lives alone, and detached from his emotions; he fits all the criteria.      Batman - What distinguishes Dexter from most serial killers is his code; he only kills people who deserve it.  His proximity to the police department criminal records gives him access to all the pedophiles, murders and mobsters who have beaten the system.  To satisfy his bloodthirsty urges, Dexter preys on these victims, and in affect, performs a great service to the community.   Batman and other crime fighters also target theworst of the criminal world, but when they \\"get their man,\\" the bad guys usually end up behind bars.  Dexter sends them to the bottom of the Ocean.
B000002HJA|5.0|Many people will tell you that this album does not stand up next to \\"Blues For the Red Sun\\" or \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\".  I strongly disagree.  The groove on this album is easily as good as \\"Sky Valley\\", but I think the best thing that sets this album apart if the different directions this album takes.<br /><br />Example 1: \\"Catamaran\\".  Easily my favorite song on the album, precisely because of how different it is.  The bass riff has an islandy/calypso feel to it.  First time I heard this song, I listened to it at least 10 times in a row.  I couldn't get enough.  Even when I listen to the album now, I still have to listen to this one three or four times.<br /><br />Example 2: \\"Phototropic\\".  The intro is really smooth.  Has a really relaxed intro, before jamming full on.  The whole song is fantastic, but the intro is what really makes this song stand out.<br /><br />With the exception of \\"Space Cadet\\", \\"Sky Valley\\" pretty much rocks you straight through.  This album has many more twists and turns.  It still has it's straight forward rockers like \\"One Inch Man\\".  Like all Kyuss albums, it has its share of instrumentals.  But there is a vibe here that isn't present on other albums.  \\"El Rodeo\\" is another really different song that stands out.<br /><br />It's a shame that they broke up after this one because it would have been really interesting to see where they would have good from here.<br /><br />For people new to the band, I would recommed starting with \\"Sky Valley\\", then going here.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am a big fan of Gregory McQuires novels, 'Wicked' and 'Confessions Of An Ugly Step-Sister' being by far the best. The way he looks at the questions of good and evil is a recurring theme. No one truely thinks they are evil, just misunderstood. And 'Good' people (bible-waving happy clappers, et al) are equally questionable. In reality everyone thinks their actions are justfied and for the best.    The news that 'Wicked' would be made into a musical floored me a little. I was eagerly awaiting the mega-bucks Hollwood adaptation that has been in the works for years with Demi Moore's production company. But a musical makes sense - Oz has always been a muscal world, and the medium it lends itself to colourful fantasy. Plus the characters can speak directly to the audience and tell us what they are thinking; hard to achieve in film.    Being in Australia I knew it would be years before we got to see 'Wicked' on stage, so  ordered the cast recording from amazon. At first I wasn't a fan of the music. I thought it was a little too Disney, and once I discovered the composers credentials lay in 'Beauty And The Beast' and 'Poccahontas', I shuddered. Elphaba sounds more like Arial from 'The Little Mermaid' than the dark and deep creature created by McGuire. But credit to Stephen Schwartz, what seemed poppy and pretty on the surface soon turned out to have a very dark heart, which beautiflly reflects the themes. The songs get better and better on further listening, and the vocal performances are sensational, especially by Kristin Chenoweth (possibly the best name ever), who has a devilish sense of comic timing and manages the different faces of Glinda (sweet Valley Girl 'Clueless' to the operatic high As.) She is hilarious and a stand-out talent. She made this recording for me and I would hate to be another performer stepping into her role.    Beautifully scored and performed, packed full of humour, and wth a story line that has been even further developed by the remarkable Winnie Holtzman, 'Wicked' is a fully realized and magical experience. Now if it would just head Down Under...
B000HIVO64|5.0|Plain and simple - it's not complicated, but it is clever and hypnotic and proof that good music doesn't mean it has a to be a chart topper (and thank God for that).  Just different enough - and yet in a league of it's own.  Quintessentially Beck music, just a tad bit more mature.    Thanks Beck!
1594837929|5.0|The book was great I could not put it down.  Nicholas Sparks did it again, another great love stories.
1594489505|2.0|While no one can doubt that at times Hosseini can vividly instill a picture into the reader's minds, his lack of themes and especially plot continue to grow old in his newest novel A Thousand Splendid Suns. While this book, unlike his first novel Kite Runner, is told from a female point of view, the story is still very reminiscient of the events described in the Kite Runner, especially the descriptions of Kabul, Afghanistan, and the Pakistani refugee camps. These repeated descriptions, plus the complete lack of plot or direction (for both novels, but especially in A Thousand Splendid Suns), makes Hosseini's writings nothing more than something to cry over, something to tell us how great we Americans are for \\"liberating\\" Afghanistan and saving them from themselves.   If you are looking for a quality piece of literature from a bestseller author (i.e. Theroux, Mahfouz, Naipual, Gordimer, even Twain) then I would strongly discourage you from picking up either book and instead cutting the corner and attending the commercialized movies for which they are clearly written.
B00018TI5E|4.0|i purchased this album when it first came out, i played it 4 or 5 times trying to get into it, but i couldn't... needless to say i was disapointed (at that point i would have given it a 1 star rating).     after listening to \\"Ataxia I\\", \\"the will to death\\", \\"dc ep\\", \\"curtains\\" and \\"inside of emptiness\\"; i was so blown away that i was left wanting more from Frusciante... so i revisited Shadows Collide With People, and only then was i able to see what John was trying to accomplish with this album. <<this is actually an outstanding album that was ruined by over-production and the fact that Flea and Chad both contributed on this album giving it a RHCP feel>>. i think if John were to revisit this album he could do a much better job and it would be the best of his solo projects. he just needs to losen the production and leave flea and chad in L.A.    4 stars because he allowed his creative passion to be overwhelmed by over-production and loyalties to the RHCP otherwise would have been 5    .

The<br />acquisition would make a perfect gift for the young child in<br />your family. It is large in size with big print. This is another important advantage for both parents and their children.

0374105235|5.0|As an over-privileged white American, it can be tough to even begin to fathom the struggles and atrocities that Africans face. When I started reading this book, I wondered if the stories Ishmael Beah would tell would be so horrific that I couldn't continue to read, much less comprehend, them.    However, Meah tells his tale with a blend of humor, distance, and insight that took me right to the edge. Any further, and I think I would have shut down. Any less far, and I believe I wouldn't have gotten the severity of his plight.    As a rule, I resist saying, \\"this is a book everyone should read,\\" as it sounds so hyperbolic. But this is definitely a book everyone should read.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|Cheap Trick made a live cd in Japan once and it was a huge success for them. The Scorpions Tokyo tapes rocks just as hard or harder really but never go the same fan fair the Cheap Trick release did.<br /><br />If you love old school Scorpions and just dig those old live of the floor recordings, then you need this disc. It crackles with excitement and pure energy that makes you can feel like your there. You will not find any lipped synced lyrics or pre-recorded tracks on here, just pure energy and passion for what they are doing. The song selection is frikin' great and the musicianship is excellent as always. Hell even Herman gets a solo on here and Francis sticks out beautifully in the mix unlike many of their big hit release etc. The dude could play, how come we never could hear him?<br /><br />So their you have it, a great live cd that still has it all these years later. In so many ways it sounds so refreshing compared to what's out there today. Just sit and listen to this good old school hard rock band doing their thing and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />A great cd that has never really gotten it's just do!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble is one of the fine young singers around today, and the job he does with these old favorites is perfect...if you like classic easy listening music, this is the cd to get...
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Although, as everyone here has already stated, Jeff Bridges is perfect for the role of the Dude...this also has to be John Goodmans finest hour. The man is absolutely hilarious and his timing right on the money as the know it all Walter. Add to that the great cameos by Sam Elliot, Flea, and Torturro, and you have a movie that you can watch over and over and still laugh yourself silly! One of my favorites.
0142501123|5.0|This is absolutely a fun book to read to your kids.  They will be riveted from start to finish.
0743201140|2.0|Very dissapointed as to what the title leads you to believe about the book. Though the authors have done a tremendous amount of research, it flaws in 2 major issues which it forgets:  a) the profile though quite specific, is similar to other profiles out there  b) 90% of the book is about why we should concentrate on our strenghts. Now lets face it, if you are a small business person like me who wants to grow his business, i already understand that i should be concentrating and exploring my strenghts and that of my organisation. I dont think i need to go thru the majority of the book to learn the concept.    If you are a small business owner like me who wants the \\"how to\\", just read chapter 7 which goes to practical issues. If on the other hand you have nothing else to do, then yes do go ahead.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|Like most people writing a review of a record right after it comes out I am not particularly objective - These guys rock and I love their music.  To me this album seems much more like \\"The Gangs All Here\\" and much less like \\"The Warriors Code\\".  \\"The Meanest of Times\\" sounds more straight ahead in your face punk than \\"The Warriors Code\\" while still infusing instruments and melodies of Irish music.  The DKM have been a band for over 10 years my greatest fear when sticking this CD into the player was that \\"The Meanest of Times\\" would be a bunch of radio friendly bubblegum punk (Blink, NOFX and the host of black shirt, red tie bands that claim to be punk) but these guys are sticking to what works: Heavy guitars, bass and drums - on top of that throw in some folk instruments to stir things up.  Yes, this is well traveled ground but I for one do not want to see them go in any other direction.  This CD is very representative of who and what the Murphy's are and should be and I hope to hear many more just like this!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I remember the first time I saw the film `Closer' and hearing this beautiful and intoxicating song culling me while the beautiful Natalie Portman walked towards me as the film came to an end.  I remember it so well because that song was `Blowers Daughter' and I immediately looked up this album.  Damien Rice has since then become my all time favorite musical act.  I've seen him perform twice now and each time leaves me wanting to hear more.  I own all of his albums and even his rare and unreleased work and I just can't get enough.  Everything he touches is golden, and here, on his debut album `O' he delivers his best work ever.  This album is so emotional and so well rounded it's hard to think of anything that comes close to it.<br /><br />What I really appreciate about the artist that is Damien Rice is that he is above everything else an artist.  He's creative and raw, not glossed over and perfected.  He works with what he has and does his best to infuse imagination into his work.  Not one song sounds the same.  He also lays his heart out with each and every cut.  He puts all he has into his music.  Whether he's singing about the birth and or the death of relationships or the struggle to move on with your life he is convincing because he stays true to himself.<br /><br />The album starts off with the beautiful `Delicate', a song that relishes in the simple things that make relationships so special.  It's the tale of new love, that lustful adoring love that blossoms from something rich and pure.  He sings about how they express their love in private because to them it's a delicate beauty, something only they share and thus is not for the world around them.  On `Volcano' Rice invites singer Lisa Hannigan to join him in what proves to be one of the best tracks on the album.  The song seems to be about a relationship gone sour and as Damien recites towards the end that \\"like a new disease she's still too young to treat\\" it becomes apparent that the damage done is long lasting.  That brings us to `Blowers Daughter', such a brilliant song and the one that brought Rice to the attention of thousands (I say thousands as apposed to millions for the reason that he is still what I consider a hidden treasure).  It's a haunting almost ghostly track that easily finds its place in your skin and stays there.<br /><br />`Cannonball' follows `Blowers Daughter' beautifully.  `Cannonball' falls more in the vein of `Delicate' as in the fact that it speaks of the beautiful side of relationships, focusing on the feeling love can give you.  The lyrics are so true.  When you think about that weightless feeling inside when thinking about the one who takes your breath away we hardly ever realize the speed in which we could fall.  `Older Chests' was the one track here that took me some time to get used to.  It's probably my least favorite but it's still a great song, speaking of the need to grow and learn from your mistakes and how time, the one thing we need in order to accomplish that, is always slipping away.<br /><br />`Amie' is without a doubt my favorite track on the album.  When I saw Rice the last time he explained this track saying that Amie was a close friend of his whom he happened to fall for.  He said he was having a crumby day and just needed to talk and so he went to see her, they sat around and drank and comforted each other and then he retreated to her guest bedroom and just couldn't stop thinking about her.  He wrote the song that night while staring out her window.  It's such a beautiful song about falling in love with the person you least expect, but having that love be the most amazing experience of your life.  The arrangements for this song also carry it to a new level, with orchestral delights and otherworldly sounds.<br /><br />`Cheers Darlin' is a great breakup track.  Here Rice is lamenting over a lost love and the fact that she has now moved onto someone knew.  In fact, she's getting married.  He's drinking his pain away here, as is made obvious by the sounds of clinking glasses and drinks being poured.  `Cold Water' is another track that perfectly captures atmosphere.  It's one of those moving songs that when really analyzed can take your breath away.  As Rice sings the first verse in a raspy, breathless voice he sounds as if he drowning and that adds so many layers to the track, and when Lisa chimes in its just breathtaking.  `I Remember' is supposedly about the worst person imaginable, about the single most detestable person to you.  Lisa sings the majority of the song before the track almost comes unhinged and changes direction drastically when Damien takes over.  It actually feels like two completely separate songs.  It's within Damien's part though that the song really comes to life as he bellows about wanting to know what this person thinks about him.<br /><br />The album officially closes with `Eskimo', a brilliant adaptation of an Opera ballad complete with Operatic samples and recordings.  It's a somewhat silly song upon a first listen as Rice sings about his Eskimo friend but when you really take the time to listen to it for what it is, experimental, it becomes the most evocative and imaginative track here.  This is the cut that proves Rice is a musical genius to me.  He takes something that not many people would consider listening to (at least not many that would listen to him...it's a different fan base) and incorporates it into his music making it accessible and enjoyable.  The album doesn't technically close yet though, it still contains two bonus tracks.  First we have `Prague' which is one of my favorite songs he's ever gone.  The lyrics are interesting and the music is brilliant.  The album finishes with Lisa singing an acappella of `Silent Night'.  This really showcases her beautiful singing voice.  It's a shame she no longer is a part of Damien's music, but I'm sure her solo venture will prove successful.<br /><br />So, this is just the first from a musical mastermind, there is more in store for the listener.  His follow up `9' is brilliant as well, while not as utterly masterful as `O', and `B-Sides' is a great addition to the collection for it showcases some great rare material as well as some demos.  But `O' is surely his finest moment and it's this album that will continue to draw in fans.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|I'll apply to this 2-disc set a frequently abused adjective that in this case is altogether justified: incredible.    A word on format: Disc 1 is more a documentary, with narrative--aptly hosted by Kris Kristofferson at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium--and interviews presiding over excerpts from the ABC Cash series. Disc 2 reverses the angle: It's a compilation of many \\"greatest hits\\" from among the 57 hours, with only occasional commentary. Among those interveiwed are Marshall Grant and Bill Williams, the arranger and director of the series' pit orchestra. Predictably, both are very informative. Excerpts from the series are well balanced, reflecting the original's spirit: Cash at the center, country-heavy yet eclectic, a spot of gospel here, a touch of Opry farce there, \\"Ride This Train,\\" and the ensemble conclusions.    A word of rebuttal: Already there are those complaining that we haven't been given every installment in its entirety. Let's curb our impatience and be grateful for what we have: beautifully restored, well edited, representative samples of the show, whose purchase now might pave the way for more to follow. Those who may complain that there's not enough Cash and too much (fill in the blank) should remember that this star was extraordinarily gracious in giving so much time to his guests and to duets with them. Furthermore, let's remember that there are few legal knots more tangled than the reproduction of music, because the rights for use are so complicated: the songwriter, the lyricist, the publisher, the arrangement, the performers, their unions, etc. I consider it a miracle that we have been given here so much, not so little. To pronounce a rare benediction: God bless the lawyers in this project!    As to the DVDs themselves, I repeat myself: incredible. We have Cash, at the very peak of his mid-career height, who was never better than when performing live before an appreciative audience. We have the unsung yet ever reliable Carl Perkins with the Tennessee Three (Grant, Bob Wooton, Fluke Johnson), tearing up the pea-patch. Mother Maybelle Carter and the Carter Sisters, all still young. The Statler Brothers, beginning to make their own name with \\"Flowers on the Wall\\" (which they perform here, after their Grammy Award). Those are \\"only\\" the regulars. The guest stars nearly comprise a Who's Who of American music in the '60s: Bill Monroe, doing the \\"Elvis version\\" of \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky.\\" Louis Armstrong. Bob Dylan. Joni Mitchell. Chet Atkins. Ray Charles--whose soul version of \\"Ring of Fire\\" has to be heard and seen to be believed. From Cash's Sun days, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. Derek and the Dominoes (representing country music's influence on America's British Invasion of the 60s). And on and on and on.    A must for Cash fans, this set should be purchased by anyone wanting a time capsule of popular music in the mid-twentieth century. Utterly entertaining and, at almost four hours, cheap at the price.
1416914285|5.0|My friend and I read this book and both loved it. It was hilarious and a really lovely book. There are many books with duller plots/beginnings, so why is everyone moaning and crying about that? Oh well, I totally recommend this book to everyone.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I have never even seen the video game, so I went into watching this with the advantage of being totally unbiased. That said, this is a wonderfully shot film. Very atmospheric, at times it reminded me of Tim Burton's \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" but minus the charm. In many scenes it rivalled Tarsem's Jennifer Lopez starrer \\"The Cell\\" for visual excellence (thats another movie you should definitely watch for 'real' horror).<br /><br />The story Im sure you know about. However, I wasn't scared even ONCE during this film, not even at its most 'inventive' moments. The premise itself was dull (how many times are we going to be subjected to the worn plot of a disgruntled little girl who was killed off and is now seeking revenge - \\"The Ring\\" anybody?) and the execution seemed to be focussed on the special effects rather than the real elements of horror.<br /><br />Radha Mitchell is a gorgeous woman and she does a fantastic job here (considering she mostly had to act scared in front of a blue screen - pretty darned impressive). But theres only so much that can take you. By the time you wind through mazes and labyrinths with her trying to find her daughter - you realize that this film is not a horror film, but a very, very stylish adventure-mystery. If you take it for what it is, it could work.<br /><br />The end was very convoluted. I mean, this whole 'parallel universe'/'existential angst' thing works well and much better in some of the darker Japanese horror films I've seen. In the last scene on the sofa, the lead actress actually looks relieved that the movie is over. This was one element I had a problem with. However, the moods of the two parallel universes were beautifully captured as one was smoky and gray and the other awash in technicolor just to make a point.<br /><br />Heres the thing - I would not call this a horror movie. Most of its horror moments are just very funny (and unintentionally so) - for example a scene where the lead actress is mauled by a dozen or so burnt baby corpses that come to life and suddenly they all turn into ash. The CG on this wasn't very good. Either way, its better than other films in the genre when it comes to special effects.<br /><br />This was definitely better than \\"Pulse\\" and \\"Sublime\\" that came out around the same time. However, its still a C-Grade horror film. Keep that in mind before you rent it, and go in with very low expectations, and you might have a good time.uddenly they all turn into ash.

B00005JPAJ|5.0|This is an artistically and technically brilliant movie. But what most impressed me was its emotional power: I cannot remember a movie as emotionally gripping as this one; I mean gripping to the point of unpleasantness, that feeling of impeding doom sitting heavily on one's chest. But this is the point of the art form of tragedy: the insight that comes with emotional catharsis.
B0001GH7KY|4.0|The movie starts out with one of the most brutal death scenes ive ever seen. The movie then drags into a little mystery and then a little gore here and there, but nothing like the opening sequence. The price is right for the movie and you cant go wrong.
006054094X|1.0|This is a terrible book that is supposed to be based on credible research but which is mainly filled with guessing and conjecture.  The book revolves around a map that could describe, with proper stretching, changing of markings and such, the New World, reminding me of the \\"science\\" that is the translation of Nostradamus' prophecies.  Menzies links any unexplained artifacts around the world that may date to the early 1400s to this particular expedition, and repeatedly discounts without argument other logical explanations that would likely have created these artifacts.    The likelihood of this story being true is further degraded by fact that the Chinese, a civilization known for keeping detailed records of its history, have never, before or after the publication of this book, attempted to claim any role in the discovery of the Americas.    Placed in the fiction section I would give it two stars.  Promoted as a serious piece of research and historical fact, it deserves zero.
B0002HMQUS|5.0|I initially purchased a cheap, lower quality monopod for $25 and let me tell you... I was not at all satisfied with it.  While it was compact, it was flimsy and one of the locking levers for the legs promptly snapped off, not to mention the fact that it didn't have a swivel-tilt head, which made it very difficult to use.        After reading the reviews on this Bogen-Manfrotto model, I decided to give it a try.  I'd have to say that I agree with all of these positive reviews about the product.  The only down-side to this product is that it is a tad longer than some cheaper models and a little heavier, but I can't deny that this thing is built tough!  The locking levers are beefy and really lock the sections tightly into position, when extended, with no worries of them slipping.  They hold the sections so tight, you could even use this thing as a walking stick on a hiking trip, if you wanted to.  The swivel-tilt head is big and solid, as well.  The thumb-wheel for the camera screw (comes with both 1/4\\" and 3/8\\" size screws) is large, which makes it quick and easy to screw to the camera, as well as allowing you to really torque the camera down to the base.  I have a Canon EOS XTI with a large 300mm lens and the swivel-tilt head held solid as a rock.  I'm sure you could use it with a larger / heavier camera with no problems.     I guess the moral of the story is that you get what you pay for.  Sure, this is  a little more expensive than some other models, but if you want a sturdy monopod that will last, this is a model you should really consider.
0767903862|5.0|This should be required reading for anybody heading to Australia.  He is an astute observer of human behavior, and relates his findings in the most humorous way.  His description of the game of cricket is the most accurate and hilarious I've ever read, and his constant reminders of how everything in Australia will kill you provides nice continuity throughout the book.
B000RG1FMO|2.0|Is it just me, or is this album a big disappointment?<br /><br />After the heat I heard on the Alter Ego Mixtape as well as one strong single (\\"Stronger\\") and one weak one (\\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\"), I thought Graduation would be at least as good as Late Registration. I was wrong.<br /><br />If Kanye did graduate, it's with a D+. There aren't any really strong/amazing/mind-blowing/infectious/catchy tracks on here, with the exception of \\"Stronger,\\" and the last track on the album \\"Big Brother\\" which is about his relationship with Jay-Z. Outside of those two, the rest I could delete from my ipod and never miss them. I was surprised the amazing track \\"Bittersweet\\" ft. John Mayer was not on here.<br /><br />Also, there are no skits about him graduating, about his fraternity broke-phi-broke, so even though Graduation is the logical follow-up to College Dropout and Late Registration, there's very little continuity between the three. Another thing I noticed was that lyrically this album was pretty pointless - he still talks about awkward/self-conscious moments, his money, etc but didn't have anything profound to say on this album.<br /><br />His collabo with Lil' Wayne on \\"Barry Bonds\\" is, to put it bluntly, trash. From the track title, I thought it would be some insightful commentary on the (racist) lynch-mob atmosphere that's been generated in the media lately around him. Instead, I got a lot of cheesey weak one-liners and only one slight reference to Barry Bonds.<br /><br />This album, along with Saigon and Papoose's, were the only albums I was looking forward to this year. A big disappointment.

I was about to buy these on DVD the first time at 99.98 each season as each came out,now you see they are cheaper than that.Good thing I said NO and just stuck with my VHS tapes...and bought the other seasons of the other ST shows.As much as I would like this all-in-one set,it still doesn't have the \\"Next Time On ST:TNG\\" previews according to a review by a editor on another web site,but does have 2 new Docs. something about TNG 20 years later and something else...I can do without and will wait until 2009 or 2010 for the HD DVD or Blu RAY copies...which ever one PARAMOUNT uses.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Let me begin by stating that while I am a fan of Rush, I probably am not as knowledgable as most of you hard core fans who have posted here. That being said I have always included Rush as one of my favorite bands and have followed them throughout thier career. It had been quite a few years since I had purchased a Rush album (CD), but I was amazingly pleased as I went through each track of S & A. I agree with a lot of fans who have stated that S & A requires multiple listenings on a good system preferably at higher volumes. S & A has received some criticism for being dark and too mid-tempo. When I listen to S & A, I hear a lot of DYNAMICS in each song - harder sections that coexist with acoustic parts that build tension in each piece which ultimatlely adds to the listeners enjoyment. There was another band that did this in their music back in the day - Led Zeppelin. I really feel that Rush has put it all together on this one - finally blending lyrics that matter with great musical scapes. We even get some chord progressions from FTK and Hemispheres. I feel that this is Rush's version of the \\"White Album.\\" Any Opinions?
B000UJ24SC|5.0|Nocturnal is amazing. its better than miasma wich is my favorite metal cd of all time!They mixed it up alot the experimented with black metal in a couple of there songs. And they hit it out of the park each song on the cd is a 5/5! Any metal fan must own this!!!!

0618680004|3.0|Dr. Michael Persinger of Laurentian University has spend decades demonstrating that certain strength fluctuations in natural type geomagnetic forces can create visions, startlingly like religious experie nces and Near Death Experiences reported by thousands.  His conclusion then is that there is no God.  Halberg and Burke showed that Native Americans have long used, and continue to use similar strength fluctuations at certain spots in the geomagnetic field to produce religious visions.  This experience strengthens their spirirtuality.  Just because there is a certain physical trigger that produces spiritual -seeming events need not mean that these esperiences are bogus. It's partiuclarly interesting when viewed in light of the fact that most Native American religions did not distinguish between the physical and spiritual.
B000002KOO|5.0|I was as captivated then as I am now by this thing that  is Then Play On. It is Fleetwood Mac at its practiced, exercised,  rehearsed studio blues best. Not a slack track, each take  is breathless, Coming Your Way introduces a lucid and yearning  sound that is rarely heard, rarely recorded and just not praised  enough. The long version of Oh Well is epic in scope and feel,  who hasn't talked to god and learned that his legs are thin?  Humor and the blues, pathos and the blues, Britain and the Blues  was the best thing to happen to Peter Green that could have   ever occurred. This album is a MUST HAVE to any collection.  Madge/Searching For Madge has all the mystery of Pink Floyd  at their Gilmore finest. Three guitars, bass and drums, the masters  Mick Fleetwood and John McVie have had their ups and downs over   the years, mostly monetary ups, but none of it would have ever   been possible without one the greatest blues guitarists of the   latter 20th century, Peter Green.   I wish there were more stars, and Although The Sun Is Shining  will capture any heart, Rattlesnake Shake will roll any blues away  with it's sweaty booze drenched boogie and slide that really does  remake the Country Blues into a British Blues, and that's a great thing.    No need to praise the Stones, Mayall, Clapton, Groundhogs, Hendrix,  Rory Gallagher/Taste(second greatest electric blues), Jeff Beck, Yardbirds,  or early Zepplin for British blues here, we all know the score, we all know  that at some point Peter Green, Rory Gallagher and Jeff Beck can bring  you to tears, rolling salty late night dancing tears of happiness to feel  and hear such extraordinary musicianship.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Eddie Vedder fans have been waiting a long time for a solo album, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Without the confines of writing for Pearl Jam, Eddie truly stretches out in his writing.  The material is challenging, but somehow accessible.  Every (I'm sure there's a muscial term for it) nuance, style, characteristic, property of his voice is highlighted here, and a few qualities I've never heard.  A lot of his yummy deeper register, and the deep humming at the end, wow. He sings the heck out of this material.    I've always felt that Eddie's voice was an instrument and that words were just something for him to wrap his voice around.  He proves it with a few songs on here... the songs without words and just pure vocalizing, humming, etc. are the best things on here (vocal-wise).  That being said, the lyrics are great and truly express the feelings the character in the movie must be experiencing, with a little left-over angst from Eddie's own experiences.  My favorites are:     I'll take this soul  That's inside me now  Like a brand new friend  I'll forever know    and    I knew all the rules  But the rules did not know me  Guaranteed
B000QUCNOK|4.0|I was completely glued to this movie for the the entire 2+ hours, in fact I may not have blinked.  It is unlike anything you have seen before.  To begin, there is very little dialogue. Instead the majority of the film is expressed visually and physically.  There is a narrator who gives insight into the main character's thoughts.  Visually it is unique. Often beautiful, sometimes disgusting, always magnificent.  The story spans the genres of drama, horror, suspense, fantasy, and period film. It's kind of like a twisted fairy tale. I gave it four stars because I think the ending seems slapped together, like the filmakers were trying desperatley to give our madman main character some redeeming quality at the last minute.  Up until that point, he is a creepy, obsessed, and insane serial killer with a one-track mind, and there is nothing in the movie to make you feel differently. Then in the last five minutes they throw this \\"He did it all for love\\" twist at you, but it's too little, too late. The BIG orgy scene is done in a way that is not profane, and in the end it has meaning and purpose. The scene is really about love and connection, not so much about sex, which helps you get over any strange feeling about watching it.  All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and likes to escape to a different world. It's not for the unimaginative, or anyone who values reality above good storytelling and fantasy.  Also not for the easily disturbed, or faint of heart.

B000PY52EU|5.0|Okay, so I'm a good lil' boy who grew up in church. Okay, so this movie had all the signs of something quite...uh...un-churchlike. Here's the funny thing: Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci take part in a fantastic redemption tale.<br /><br />\\"Black Snake Moan\\" starts its story with two hurting people who deal with their pain in very different ways. Rae, played by Ricci, is left alone when her boyfriend heads off to war, and finds herself giving way to her fleshly desires. There's not much hidden here, the rating is well-deserved, and yet there's little that's gratuitous. This is a woman looking for unconditional love in all the wrong places. Lazarus, played by Jackson, also wants the real deal of love, but he's been burned by his cheating wife and brother. He's withdrawn from everything.<br /><br />Two people. Two lives, caught in the black snake's coils. And somehow, through a set of circumstances that are at once over-the-top and wholly believable, Rae and Laz forge a chaste relationship that leads them both through the storm of evil to the light on the other side. Both see glimpses of hope, but neither is guaranteed of grasping it. They must act in faith and move forward.<br /><br />While jerking the chains of all who want to criticize, \\"Black Snake Moan\\" actually hides a beautiful tale of love and forgiveness. Even while performing his own tough love and intervention with Rae, Laz admits to his own weakness and deals with it. Both do a wonderful job of acting, with the music and the direction providing superb counterpoint to their emotional and spiritual journey. Timberlake is okay in his role, and the other supporting players do credible jobs.<br /><br />This here is not only a well-told story, it's also much closer to the Jesus I know from the Bible than the one we often see camouflaged in overly pious renditions. When this black snake moans, it's good to know that Rae and Lazarus still want to keep that little light shining.
B000SNUMCU|5.0|\\"The end, the songwriter's dead...\\" begins the first track of the album.  Despite the presentation of these chilling words, they are far from the truth concerning Dark Passion Play and Nightwish.  Nightwish, replaced former vocalist Tarja Turunen with Anette Olzon, have released their sixth studio album and the first in three years.  As the thousands of Nightwish fans groaned when Tarja was fired, we all wondered whether the new vocalist could fill Tarja's shoes and if Nightwish could live up to what it had become, one of the world's best symphonic metal albums fronted by one of the best female metal vocalists.      Well most of the jury is still out, but this one says there is absolutely nothing to worry about; Dark Passion Play is my new favorite Nightwish album.  Oceanborn and Once were my favorites before, but no longer.  And astonishingly enough, one of the reasons may in fact be the vocals.  So really there are three reasons why I enjoy DPP more than all of the other Nightwish albums: Anette Olzon, more epic, and the Poet and the Pendulum.      Beginning with Anette.  Anette is...not Tarja.  For me, in a very good way (though I will concede that many will take this in a very negative way).  She is a completely different vocalist and I look forward to hearing her sing the old songs live.  For one, she is an alto rather than a soprano, uses very little vibrato, and sounds like a rock singer rather than an operatic vocalist.  That is not to say I don't like the operatic vocals that Tarja utilized so admirably--far from it, as groups like Epica are still among my favorites and Tarja is one of the greatest female metal vocalists of all time.  Perhaps one of the reasons I like Anette so much is that she is a change from the operatic-soprano vocals that are very often found in symphonic and gothic metal bands (which I listen to a lot of).  Her voice, I find, is much better at conveying emotion than Tarja's was (again, personal preference).  Ultimately, each person will decide on the vocals and that will make or break the album for them because really, the rest of the band has not changed unexpectedly.  The band continues on the deviation that began with Century Child from the symphonic metal \\"standard\\" that they set with Oceanborn.  Each album has grown steadily more progressive and DPP is no exception.    More epic...My favorite Nightwish songs have been pieces like Ghost Love Score, Beauty of the Beast, Creek Mary's Blood, and Dead Boy's Poem.  For the same reason I like groups like Rhapsody of Fire, I love songs like these for the epic feel.  With Once and the addition of a full, large-scale orchestra and choir as an everpresent force, the epic feel has grown larger and larger.  The album has five tracks that are nearly six minutes long, it starts and ends with two massive works, and the most epic-feeling song ever written by Nightwish is in this album in the form of The Poet and the Pendulum.    My track-by-track analysis of the album:    1) The Poet and the Pendulum: Reason 3 for why DPP is the best of the Nightwish albums.  14 minutes of London Session Orchestra + Anette + Nightwish + Full Choir + A Boy Soprano (or two).  I could write a whole review/analysis on this song alone, but since it's part of an album, I cannot.  As the longest ever written and the Tuomas' favorite, the song is divided into five parts, changes pace many times, and includes basically everything you could imagine could fit into a song.  It begins with the wailing vocals of a boy soprano, reading off an obituary of \\"the songwriter.\\"  The tension already present in this introduction suddenly bursts when the full orchestra explodes into action, followed shortly by the heavy metal guitars of the rest of the band.  It subsides a bit when Anette begins the first verse, singing from what sounds like Tuomas' perspective.  With the powerful, awe-inspiring chorus, the orchestra, choir, and band erupt once again.  Part two continues in this way, bombastic andepic until it truly subsides into the same feel the introduction had with the boy soprano returning.  When Anette joins in, it is clear that the soprano vocals of Tarja are gone with Anette singing in a lower octave.  Then the brass sounds and ominous words are whispered loudly before switching gears immediately into Marco howling.  Anette returns, however, and the chorus is played for the last time before Tuomas' obituary is completed.  The fifth part is truly beautiful, sounding almost like a whole new song (almost three minutes long) and all traces of the violence and power played previously are gone.  The lyrics are for all intents and purposes Tuomas writing his death (and resurrection in part five) into a song.  They are profound and powerful and though, obviously, he is not dead, he was feeling immense sadness and was heavily weighed down as he wrote the album.  This is truly the heart and soul of DPP and is one of my favorite Nightwish songs ever written.  10/10    2) Bye Bye Beautiful: Bye Bye Beautiful is, as many would guess, a musical farewell to Tarja.  It is not an offensive or hate-filled farewell but is more of a sad and bittersweet farewell.  For Tuomas, it was a song that \\"needed to be done\\" and he says it sounds much more aggressive than the meaning behind it actually is.  There are many references to the grievances that the band listed in the open letter that announced Tarja's firing.  Musically, it is an aggressive track with Anette singing the verses and Marco singing the powerful chorus.  It feels completely different from The Poet and the Pendulum, but knowing what had happened to the band, it does not come unexpected.  8.5/10    3) Amaranth: Amaranth itself is, as Tuomas and the band have said, very catchy and has a nearly-pop-sounding chorus, very much an ideal song for a single. Anette is the sole vocalist on the track and most of her vocals are accompanied with a strong drumbeat with the orchestra playing lightly in the background for most of the song. The chorus is basically the song, very catchy with Anette's vocals layered on top of each other for a very nice-sounding harmony. A fun song, much lighter than the two previous songs and is much more easily accessible than the rest of DPP.  9/10    4) Cadence of Her Last Breath: One of Anette's favorite songs (and one of Tuomas' least favorite), Cadence begins with burdened breathing, soon followed by guitar riffs and keyboards.  For me, Cadence's verses and development are very powerful and there is a short, but sweet guitar solo, but the chorus never really did it for me, almost as though it went away from the phrases that get built up by the verses.  Anette sings this song with Marco shouting \\"Run away\\" in the chorus.  8/10    5) Master Passion Greed: The hardest song Nightwish has ever written is about the other half of Tarja's dismissal, her husband Marcelo Cabuli.  Unlike Bye Bye Beautiful, this is not a bittersweet song, but a bitter song since the band believes the business-first attitude of Marcelo is what brought about the break between Tarja and the rest of the band.  It is sung entirely by Marco (who also shares writing credits) and there is a good amount of screaming, thrash guitar, and growling (by Tuomas?).  One of the longer songs and much heavier than anything ever done before by Nightwish, it is an interesting song that, like Bye Bye Beautiful, does not come unexpected and is a definite change of pace.  8.5/10    6) Eva: The first single released from DPP and the first song released featuring Anette's vocals, it is also the first ballad on the album.  It is a beautiful and primarily orchestral piece.  The lyrics are something to note as well.  They are exquisite and very well-written, even for Tuomas's work.  Mix in a strong guitar solo and backing vocals by a gospel choir (which will be heard much more later) and you get a very solid ballad.  9/10    7) Sahara: Sahara is a breakaway piece written with an exotic African/Egyptian sound.  A bit reminiscent of Creek Mary's Blood from Once, it is a diverse track, utilizing Anette's vocals in many different ways.  The riffs are heavy and the orchestra and choir play a major role as well.  It is an epic and powerful song and is another change of pace from the rest of the album.  It is one of my favorites from the album.  10/10    8) Whoever Brings the Night: Written by Emppu (lyrics by Tuomas), this very much sounds like a guitarist's song.  The intro kicks in with heavy guitars, the riffs are dominant and powerful, and there is a lengthy guitar solo.  The vocals are much less pronounced and the vocals speak of deceptive love and falsehood.  Not one of my favorites, but it adds to the diversity of the overall album.  8.5/10    9) For the Heart I Once Had: A sad and mournful song, Anette's vocals are the feature of this song.  At times it seems that the notes of the song are at the edge of her range, but she carries the song admirably.  She puts a huge amount of emotion into her voice for this piece, which would otherwise be a bit flat.  8.5/10    10) The Islander: Yet another change of pace.  A Celtic ballad written by Marco and sung primarily by him, the Islander is all very folkish and serene.  Sung very much like something out of Ireland, it is a well-written piece and very different from the rest of the album so far.  There are a wide variety of instruments, from bodhran drums to flutes to fiddles to uileann pipes.  9/10    11) Last of the Wilds: The only all-instrumental piece on the album, Last of the Wilds is a treat to the ears.  It is basically a duel between Finnish and Celtic instruments joined in by the electric guitars and drums of the band.  It is an awesome piece with instruments diverging everywhere from the main melody.  It resembles a jam session I participated in not long ago, mixing many different kinds of instruments and improvising in many different directions.  An excellent piece.  10/10    12) 7 Days to the Wolves: Inspired by a Stephen King novel, 7 Days to the Wolves seems to be somewhat of Beauty of the Beast's successor.  Starting out with some simple drumbeats and string parts, it launches into a dark and heavy verse and chorus.  There is a long instrumental section heavily reminiscent of part of Bless the Child that builds up to one of the most powerful and aggressive vocal lines Anette sings on the whole album.  It's a lengthy, 7-minute song with a good bit of power behind it.  9/10.    13) Meadows of Heaven: The grand finale of the album, it comes with a gospel choir (that was allowed to sing \\"heaven\\" in as many ways as they liked but nothing relating to Christianity) in tow.  The ending of this song is simply breathtaking.  It is difficult to describe (funny considering how much I went off on the Poet and the Pendulum).  A very powerful and emotional finish and an excellent conclusion to the album.  10/10    Concluding Remarks: For those who doubted Nightwish's ability to come out with something new that could match their old material, DPP proves them wrong.  Then again there always are those who will put down this album regardless.  As a hardcore Nightwish fan, I had very high standards when I began listening but they were all met.  Anette is a great vocalist and Nightwish is as good as ever.  Recommended for all metal fans.      9.5/10

I make it an annual event to watch it as a personal reminder of what Jesus Christ did for me nearly 2000 years ago.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth is one filled with love, serenity and, yes, passion. You can see the love of Jesus for all people in his eyes when he speaks. You can see the hurt when he is treated unjustly. If Jim Caviezel did so awesome a job portraying Jesus, one can only imagine the Lord's expression when the events in this film actually happened a couple millennia ago.<br /><br />Based on the Gospels and Roman and Jewish history, Mel Gibson has crafted a well-executed account on what Jesus Christ went through on our behalf.<br /><br />Many complain the film is nothing but sheer gore. Yes, it is bloody, but if you look into Roman history and discovered what Roman scourging and crucifixion entailed, you'd find Gibson's film is bang on. He also made the right choice to display what happened how it happened instead of just putting a few scratch marks on Jesus and a robe splashed with red paint like other films have done. By seeing Jesus murdered as He was, the audience feels the impact of that day long ago. It forces them to pause and reflect.<br /><br />This film serves as a reminder for believers in Jesus, and serves, hopefully, as a touching account of the ultimate sacrifice from the ultimate Love to those who don't believe.<br /><br />It would take a terribly cold heart to not be moved by this film.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />A.P.

0375836675|3.0|A very good concept, tight writing, interesting characters -- and an absolutely awful ending. That's a shame -- the idea of a young man being forced by a mysterious stranger to engage with the people around him and become an active participant in his own world is marvelous. The characters are crisply drawn, the plot is novel and charming, and the prose is quite well executed. So: the author couldn't sustain it, and didn't really know how to end it. Big deal? Yes- when the cop-out is of this magnitude. Don't bother with this one -- it's just too long a book and too compelling a mystery to invest your time in for such a terribly misguided denouement.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I can see people hating this album, but I really like it and it's really modern sounding. Finally a good album after all those years! I really wanted to like No Prayer For The Dying and Fear Of The Dark, but they were just depressing and slowed down and cluttered with needless songs like \\"Public Enema Number One\\" and AC-DC wannabe songs like \\"Hooks In You\\" and \\"Judas Be My Guide\\". Virtual XI was caca at best, But then Brave New World was their BEST album yet. Then this comes along, and I love it. It's in my top 5!<br /><br />WILDEST DREAMS: 5/5: A good opener. Catchy and singalong-able.<br /><br />RAINMAKER: 4/5: A very bluesy and catchy song, definitely very biblical sounding.<br /><br />NO MORE LIES: 5/5: This is a very cool track, and sounds different tha anything else they made.<br /><br />MONTSEGUR: 5/5: Sounds like classic Maiden! I love when he yells \\"AT THE GATES!!!!! AND THE WALLS!!!!! OF MONTSEGUR!!!!! BLOOD ON THE STONES OF THE CITADEL!!!!!\\"<br /><br />DANCE OF DEATH: 4/5: What a great track.<br /><br />GATES OF TOMORROW: 5/5: Very raw, meaty, and great. Bruce is at his best. I love the chorus, and the solo from Janick.<br /><br />NEW FRONTIER: 10/5: The best song on the album! Catchy, great rhythm, plus Nicko wrote it!<br /><br />PASCHENDALE: 4/5: A good song.<br /><br />FACE IN THE SAND: 5/5: I once said this song was crap, God did I make such a stupid mistake! This song is AWESOME! Especially the intro.<br /><br />AGE OF INNOCENCE: 5/5: A great song.<br /><br />JOURNEY MAN: 5/5: Awesome! One of the softer tracks, plus it has one of the best choruses.<br /><br />So this is a really good album, and buy it if you're a die hard Maiden fan, I say!
B00005JPVL|4.0|Shoot `Em Up was not at the top of my list to see but my wife and I like Clive Owen so we decided to give the film a look.  The story is as flimsy and ridiculous (a gun-control Senator creating a baby farm so he can have a supply of bone marrow) as they come and the characters are equally shallow: the entire point is to create as many different shoot outs as possible.  Humor in violence is nothing new in the cinema and what makes this film work is Clive Owen's performance as the carrot chewing Mr. Smith, an unlikely dark knight for the newborn he is protecting but certainly a cut above the odious Hertz (played with snarling fury by Paul Giammetti).  Monica Bellucci makes a great partner and foil for the indestructible Mr. Smith as they dodge bullets with the baby in tow.  The film takes in some situations that some of us will have empathy with, such as the driver of a Mercedes who doesn't use turn signals and cuts off other drivers, the final insult coming when he throws a paper cup out of his window.      The film comes off more like a PC game with its impossible situations and one-dimensional characters but also has the element of perverse fun that goes with a game.  However, some viewers will find the seemingly endless killing disturbing as the film tries to be more inventive as how to do away with the endless supply of bad guys.  I am not sure that this is a movie that I will want to see again but it was entertaining the first go around.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Iron Maiden have definitely matured, and AMOLAD proves it. AMOLAD, Iron Maiden's 14th studio album, is ther best since Seventh Son, IMO. Whilst most of the songs use the E note as a base for the songs, it does it very well!<br /><br />DIFFERENT WORLD: 8/10 This is the first single from the album, pretty catchy and overall very worthwile.<br /><br />THESE COLORS DON'T RUN: 9/10: This song starts off very slow, then after that, speeds up and becomes catchy. A very good song about war. \\"These colors don't run from cold bloody war!!!!!\\"<br /><br />BRIGHTER THAN A THOUSAND SUNS: 10/10 My third favorite from the album, about The Manhattan Project. When Bruce sings \\"Out of the darkness, Brighter than a thousand suns...\\" then after softly singing it for a while SCREAMS it, it blows me away.<br /><br />THE PILGRIM: 10/10: The 2nd best song IMO. Has a very egyptian-flavored vibe to it, and the guitar solo is Maiden's best! Long live Adrian Smith!<br /><br />THE LONGEST DAY: 10/10: A very intense, frightening song about WWII. Very cool.<br /><br />OUT OF THE SHADOWS: 10/10: Very good slow-ish song about birth. I like the guitar work on this peice, and Bruce's voice has never been better.<br /><br />THE REINCARNATION OF BENJAMIN BREEG: 10/10: Who IS Bejamin Breeg???? I guess we'll never know, but that aside, good song. I like the slow intro, and the chorus. Also a great source for moving, meaningful lyrics.<br /><br />FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF GOD: 7/10: Dissapointing at best, but an OK song. Takes almost 3 minutes just to cut to the chase.<br /><br />LORD OF LIGHT: 9/10: Great song that lets you imagine places between Earth and Hell, and that Lucifer is the Lord of Light.<br /><br />THE LEGACY: 20/10: They saved the best for last! Great acoustic intro, plus this has Bruce's best vocal work ever!!!<br /><br />So this is, IMO, their best album. If I were on my death bed, this would definitely be playing in my room. Keep up the good work guys! UP THE IRONS, FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|what can i say, it just the best, its art,,,i wish were }capture on film.
B000B8QG4A|4.0|Don't be fooled by the misleadingly kitsch covert art: The movie inside is not as gaudy as you could think: It is an exercise in good taste.<br /><br />There is a certain charm present in this movie that has not been recaptured by recent animated features. Perhaps it's just nostalgia, but I really feel that these golden-era animators put their very best in the creation of these films. It was something of a more personal work, especially for Walt, who grew up in a town very similar to that seen in the movie. The only recent movie that tries to bring that magic and personal touch back is Ratatouille, and I really hope Pixar considers bringing hand-drawn animation back from the grave.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this edition only 4 stars because of the lousy DVD cover.

B000S0GYRU|4.0|****1/2   Half A Star Taken Off For Lack Of Subs And A Brief Cut    As much as i'm disappointed about the lack of subtitles, everyone seems to forget or be ignorant of a production fact about Itallian Horror and most noteablely Argento Films. EVERYTHING in an Argento film (with the excpetion of Trauma and sections of Phenomena) is dubbed! They film the scene first (without recording audio) and then dub in the diogloue later. This is especially evident in Lucio Fulci's Zombie where the English track seems to favor the Male and Female lead and the professor, while the itallian track seems to fit the supporting cast better. But as much as i would have liked Subs for this film, the Itallian track is a dub as well. Given this fact, it's up to you which you prefer, I personally like Itallian tracks, though Planet Of The Vampires just...i don't know it got on my nerves, something seemed really off about that Itallian.
B000002G87|5.0|Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs has long been neglected as a full body of work. Focus has always been on the title cut, Layla, with its mythological connection and present-day love story. The piano solo and the guitar singing at the end of the song certainly stand alone and stand the test of time.<br />There's more gems on this album than that, though. The welcoming of fellow guitar legend Duane Allman into the studio set off some six-string fireworks that are rarely approaced.<br />\\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" was born on this album, as was \\"Why Does Love have To Be So Sad.\\"<br />The Dominos form a tight, up-tempo rock group that puts a personal touch on \\"Nobody Knows You When You Are Down And Out\\" and Hendrix's \\"Little Wing.\\"<br />It's a must-own for Clapton fans and guitar groupies alike.

I was unable to watch the movie in theaters (so bad!) in Detroit area simply because it wasn't shown there, so I waited 9 months since it's DVD premiere to buy and enjoy it! The Italian dubbed versions on the Internet only made my interest rise. As a great Lynch cinema lover and professional musician/composer/engineer/producer I highly admire this great production. The second DVD with extra features deserve special attention and hats down to David for bringing us these details of his movie-magic! I wonder what will follow next after this extraordinary desection of human intellect and the World we're living in?
B00008GKEG|5.0|From the Beatles' own mouths, this is the ultimate insider view of a cultural phenomenon that changed the world. The only downside is that, because the series was originally made for TV, the DVDs aren't in widescreen format. You can compensate with the \\"zoom\\" aspect on your widescreen TV, which usually looks great, but on some of the old footage, heads might be cut off. Viewing in the \\"Just\\" (justify) aspect ratio gives you the whole image in widescreen, but the Fab Four (and everything else) look a bit squished. Or just watch in undistorted 4:3 aspect, with bars on the side. Any way you view it, The Beatles Anthology is a must for any current or former Beatlemaniac, as well as rock musicians or students of the art who want to know how we got to where we are today. And hearing the lads in 5.1 Dolby Sound is a thrill. The extra disc of special features offers Beatle perspectives filmed years after the original series aired. You can buy a coffee-table companion book to the Beatles Anthology series, which adds lots of color and detail not in the DVDs, and I recommend it to the serious fan, but it's so big and heavy that it isn't easily read in bed, or in any position, for that matter.<br /><br />Update Aug. 15, 2011: Ignore my comments about aspect ratio issues (I had an old DVD player and widescreen TV back then); my newer Oppo DVD player and Panasonic plasma TV seem to have much better capability to fill the widescreen with a 4:3 image in the \\"full\\" aspect ratio without causing much, if any noticable distortion. Looks great!

Dialogue and all other sound was put in later in the studio. The actors are spoke their lines in their native tongues(the star spoke english) when filming, and none of those lines where used. That said, this is the best Suspiria has ever looked, and the sound is great! The extras with Dario are all one could ask for.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|The Ascent of Man (1973) is a 13 part documentary about the history of science by Jacob Bronowski. It inspired Carl Sagan to make Cosmos (1980). The format for The Ascent of Man is based on Kenneth Clark's Civilisation (1969). It is hard not to mention The Ascent of Man without talking a little bit about Cosmos.<br /><br />The Ascent of Man is widely regarded as a milestone in documentary film making. It maybe the best history of science documentary series ever made. More than 30 years later Bronowski's intensity to describe a world history of science remains unparalleled in the annuals of educational television. It will remain powerful for quite some time to come. The Executive Producer Adrian Malone went on to direct Carl Sagan's Cosmos after it.<br /><br />The Ascent of Man remains an indispensable series for the human condition. It changes the way people think about themselves, their lives and the world they live in. It is a major conscious raiser. The Ascent of Man also has a bigger impact on the human condition than Cosmos does. While Cosmos treats us as the universe's way of understanding itself, The Ascent of Man is about humanity's hope in getting the right knowledge in the right way, to all individuals across the globe. That knowledge is the scientific method and its results.<br /><br />The Ascent of Man is also harder hitting than Cosmos in terms of its psychological impact. Cosmos is a gentle going voyage through the universe while The Ascent of Man brings us right into the thick of it with the struggle of mankind through primitive life to liberation through logical thinking.<br /><br />The Ascent of Man will reveal how life really is and what you need to do about it. Bronowski is also more abrupt than Sagan in how he reveals things. Death is death and sex is sex. Nothing is buttered up. Nothing is omitted. The facts are laid bare for all to see. If you can learn what The Ascent of Man teaches and retain the information (by repeat viewings) you will find yourself a lot more alert to the world than the average person. These are the things that matter so that we can live life. Without them, we simply wouldn't be here to make and watch programs like The Ascent of Man.<br /><br />The Ascent of Man slowly builds up to directly challenging the ideas of absolutist politics and dogmatic belief structures without offending but by simply being subversive with the application of critical thinking and thus revolutionary in thought and practice from construction of the arch to developing the atom bomb. Bronowski has no time for anything less than the reevaluation of everything humans have learned to date. While Cosmos demystifies, The Ascent of Man upsets stagnation. It is about the history of those who don't strive for improvement when faced with those who do. It is about the harshness of survival but continued existence also needs to incorporate cooperation and the freedom of information.<br /><br />Episode 1: \\"Lower than the Angels\\"<br />Grunion fish.

1596912375|3.0|This is a well enough written book, as one would expect from William Boyd. That said, its the weakest Boyd I've ever read. This time his portrayal of real life characters in interesting times and extraordinary circumstances falls flat. I found it very hard to care even a bit for the daughter's story. I found it only a little harder to care for the mother's pretty-girl-turned-murderous-spy plot. Even the wartime situations the mother is involved in and that lead up to the climax of the novel are very far from enthralling. Its almost as if this is a novel without protagonists, since the protagnists themselves and the plot around them is so uninteresting. Emphasizing all this are the surrounding characters (ie the Iranian english student, the estranged german father of Jochen, his brother and Ilse) who not only add nothing to the plot but provide no really interesting subplots of their own (actually, to the contrary).     Boyd can be wonderful. But for wonderful Boyd please go for \\"An Ice Cream War\\".
B000SM7QUC|4.0|I believe we have seen the best Motley Crue will ever have to offer but would not mind being surprised in the future by a new CD or reunion. (doubtful though). I had major doubts about this album, and half expected to hear a reach for the golden Motley years. MAN! Was I pleasantly disappointed!<br /><br />What I heard was a dark, raw treatment of SIXX's life, overwhelming anguish, wasted years and the elation of surviving a life and death struggle. It tugged at my soul. It made me feel for this guy's life.<br /><br />You immediately get drawn into a dark, intense snapshot moment in \\"X-MAS\\" (*****) your heart broken in \\"Van Nuys\\" (*****) and catapulted to joyous heights with \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" (*****). It might be the story, but it also can be the awesome vocals. I'm singing these songs out loud and I never was a heroin junkie! The rest of the CD has very enjoyable moments with very few low points:<br /><br />\\"Pray for me\\" (*****)<br />\\"Tommorow\\"(*****)<br />\\"Accidents can happen\\" (****)<br />\\"Intermission\\" (**)<br />\\"Dead Man's Ballet\\" (***)<br />\\"Heart Failure\\" (****)<br />\\"Golden eyes\\" (*****)<br />\\"Courtesy Call\\" (****)<br />\\"Permission\\" (****)<br />\\"Life After Death\\" (***)<br /><br />Do not buy this CD looking for Motley Crue. Buy it to experience something alternative, different, outside the mainstream, although some will accuse it of being a bit pop and commercial. The first three songs are worth the price of this CD alone, but you will enjoy the rest. I hope this is not a one album fluke. Mr. Sixx, the potential is awesome. Give us more please!<br /><br />In case you're wondering:<br /><br />(*) Sucks<br />(**) Ok<br />(***) Good<br />(****) Better<br />(*****) Great<br /><br />\\"everyone's eyes are blue, everyone's mouth is dry, and nobody wants to die in Van Nuys.\\"
B00006JMQG|4.0|If you want to see the film with the best possible presentation, buy the KINO version.<br /><br />-The video is sharper<br />-Properly colour-tinted<br />-Has scrolling inter-titles to better replicate the original German ones<br />-Looks better than any other copy available. Yes I'm referring to the Image disc.<br /><br />One negative:<br />-The first segment looks fairly poor in quality.<br /><br />The Image discs main advantages are:<br />-A better musical track<br />-A commentary track.<br />Major disadvantages:<br />-A transparent line going through the top of a few scenes.<br />-A window boxed transfer<br /><br />Still, I won't give either set 5 starts because a better version can be made of either. The ultimate Caligari set would inlcude the best of both discs.

B0000025D0|5.0|Darkness On the Edge of Town is EASILY one of Bruce Springsteen's best albums.  Haunting and honest lyrics make up one portion of the listening experience- quiet, laidback songwriting giving the atmosphere a familiar homemade sound makes up the other.  Even the vocal melodies (which are normally the weakest parts of a Springsteen album) are pretty darn good for the most part.  All the instrumental sections are wonderful as well.  It really seems like Bruce and the band put extra time and devotion into Darkness On the Edge of Town compared to previous albums because the songwriting is just superb overall.<br /><br />\\"Badlands\\" chugs along in an upbeat kind of way with passionate and relatively sad vocals, \\"Adam Raised the Cain\\" continues the theme of being overly emotional but in this case I sense anger in Bruce's vocals and the presence of an electric guitar is a surprise, \\"Something In the Night\\" is a slightly overlong beautiful and honest ballad, \\"Candy's Room\\" is a highlight not just for this album but *my favorite Springsteen song ever!* thanks to the quiet way the piano builds into a crashing chorus with a ton of vision and imagination, \\"Racing In the Street\\" contains relatable lyrics for those of us who grew up near (or in) New Jersey and worked on vehicles at some point in our lives, \\"The Promised Land\\" carries an upbeat melody with lyrics about the harsh and relentless daily routine of getting up and working, \\"Factory\\" is short and highly melodic with more lyrics about the hardships of working day in and day out, \\"Streets of Fire\\" continues with the memorable vocals (based around a simple but effective melody in this particular case), \\"Prove It All Night\\" has an excellent chorus and is probably the most popular song here (classic rock radio still occasionally plays it) and the title song is just awesome by being a well-made tune, 'nuff said.<br /><br />I love this album!
B00005JPLW|5.0|Greatest visual performance in movie so far!  Perfect adaptation!  Great music.  First class action!  Simple and entertaining plot.    Excellent extras on the 2nd DVD.
B000IMSPE8|5.0|I am not a historian, but I am enormously impressed with how successfully Mr. Rutherford relates history through the rich personal dramas of the characters he creates. For instance, I recently picked up a book by William Miller entitled \\"Eye for an Eye\\" which studies the medieval practice of putting prices on body parts. Miller wants to make a point about the role of reciprocity in \\"honor cultures,\\" because he feels that moderns also live by the rules of reciprocity without being fully conscious of how deeply they are committed to these rules. Interesting stuff for the ethnologist or perhaps (my area) the amateur moral theologian, but for everyone else, let's face it, pretty dry stuff. But RUTHERFORD makes the system of putting prices on body parts in Saxon England COME TO LIFE!! He relates the ambitions of a family descended from the ancient (Celtic) Britons whose social status falls between Churl and Thane, and if only he can buy that 5th acre of land he wants, he will move up to the social rank of thane and dramatically alter the standing and fortunes of his family!! Finally, his opportunity comes unexpectedly when a neighboring farmer severs his hand in a drunken fit and is obligated by Saxon \\"law\\" to pay him the wirgeld, a sizeable sum of money. Thus you learn about the beginnings of AngloSaxon Common Law through a story that is pretty darn entertaining. I intend to use this book in my homeschooling program. In fact, I'm logged into Amazon right now to buy some extra copies for my wife & teenagers. (What a pity that Amazon does not list any paperbacks!!!!) By the way, this book is very much like Mishner's The Source, but in my opinion, it is better written and the characters and story lines are richer. If you loved the The Source, as I did, you will love this book. The stories contain sensuality, but always in the context of a substantive treatment of the character's personality, never as some 2-dimensional fantasy. The author is intelligent & wise about the human condition, and man, does he know his country's history!! Is this guy from Salisbury, I wonder?
1569242739|5.0|Words cannot explain how good this cookbook is. Isa and Terry have done it again! First let me explain that my husband and I are not vegan (gasp!). However, we do strive toward a more healthy lifestyle having stumbled upon Isa's first book VWV. Within the pages of VWV is a recipe for a veganized version of the famous Hostess cupcakes. I have made them for several events, all to rave reviews. When the 'cupcake book' (as it is known in our house) came out, I just had to give it a try. We have been cooking our way through it and I can honestly say, it ROCKS. You won't be disapointed. The recipes are easy, they don't take special equipment, and offer plenty of alternatives and suggestions in the event you don't have a particular something or other in your pantry. It is hard to not love this book. Can't wait for the next one ladies.  You are going to make a convert out of our household yet!

075640407X|5.0|This story is told from the perspective of a grown orphan, who became a foster child, who grew into great magical power while coming of age . . . sound familiar? Well, if anything, I enjoyed this book more than the Potter series. It is darker, and more 'real' even though it is in an alternative reality. Kvothe winds up at University, which is all things Hogwarts, but has different adventures, and learns different lessons. All in all, one of the best books I've read in the last year.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Someone changed the title music, to begin with. If you leave the menu on your screen and listen, you will hear the original title music, a brief rock interlude followed by a wistful jazz piano. The strident, cacaphonous trumpet you hear under the titles is the wrong music.<br /><br />If Blowup looks and feels different from the four Antonioni films that preceded it, one reason may be that Antonioni used an English editor, Frank Clarke (uncredited). The pace of the movie is far faster than what a viewer of L'Eclisse or La Notte would expect.<br /><br />In many scenes there are sudden, apparently pointless cuts. These are inserted to give the movie a more nervous look than we expect from Antonioni. Perhaps, knowing he was making his first mystery, Antonioni planned this new style with his editor.<br /><br />There are other mannerisms, not unique to this film, that are always interesting. The camera follows a receding car for some distance, then slows down and lets the car get further away.<br /><br />A burst of music will suddenly be heard, and just as suddenly fade away. In the studio this seems to signify the photographer's preoccupation with the photos, causing him to forget the music.<br /><br /> -- Critics and the public are correct in viewing Antonioni as a dark pessimist about human nature. He sees us as sadly unequipped for the challenges of reality, relationships, moral judgment, etc. The theme of the movie is how easily the photographer is distracted from the serious business at hand, i.e. the apparent murder captured by his camera. He is no match for the reality before him, and drifts from one diversion to the next. The wonderful scene of the Yardbirds playing to a catatonic audience, and our hero coming away with the worthless trophy, sums up the director's view of him.<br /><br />But the key scene of the movie is when the photographer, suspecting the murder, leaves his studio without his camera, finds the body in the park, can't photograph it, and returnsto the studio to find that all the prints and negatives of the event have been stolen in his absence. One false step and everything is lost. The record of the reality, and perhaps the reality itself.<br /><br />Antonioni invited the debate about whether anything at all happened -- the murder, the photographs, the scene in the park, etc. -- by having the imaginary tennis ball at the end of the film begin to make plocking noises, and by having the photographer disappear. Why Antonioni called this moment his &#34;signature&#34; is a mystery to me. Possibly to bring more people into the theaters.<br /><br />The scene in the park is a classic of form and color and movement. Nothing like it has been done before or since. If you turn the volume up on your TV during this scene, you will realize that the trees and bushes, being blown by the wind, are definite conspirators in what is happening to the man and woman. Similarly, in the final scene, the sky has turned grey and the trees and bushes seem to mock the photographer who has returned to the scene of his greatest failure.<br /><br />I had to watch the movie 50 times before I realized that the killer behind the fence is the grassy knoll assassin in Dallas. The movie was made three years after the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />The scenes in the studio, discovering the truth hidden in the photos, have been much imitated. They are wonderful, breathless, dramatic.<br /><br />Today the question of reality seems far less pertinent than the shallowness of the photographer [who may also be the artist, according to some] and his inability to confront the real in an adult, responsible way. But it can be argued that if human perception is so skewed by selfish concerns and shallow desires, the human race never really perceives a real world at all. Only the next pleasure, the next gratification, the next need or project. The human world we see around us, colored by war, famine, violence, and the colossal indifference of man to his fellow man, may be a world built by creatures who do not have a reality. Only a stubborn need to be safe, to be blind. Possibly this is the sense of those last troubling images.<br /><br />Incidentally, I saw the movie four or five times in the theater, and I saw no scenes that have been deleted, as the reviewer above claims. As far as I can remember, the movie is completely intact in this DVD.
B0000700KL|5.0|Baraka really has to be experienced. It is not a conventional film in any aspect, as there are no spoken words, no plot, no special affects but a visual and cultural spin around the globe with absolutley stunning visuals and highly effective sounds. I like to watch it every so often and I still get amazed by it. Ron Fricke has done an astounding job at making us realize that in every part of Planet Earth we are all connected by this living experience. We are all connected to life. So watch and draw your own conclusions.
0143039881|5.0|I am delighted to see this classic back in print. Jewish author Hannah Arendt has provided a wealth of timeless information that goes far beyond the trial of the German war criminal Adolf Eichmann. This review is based on the original (1964) edition.<br /><br />Arendt (p. 39) gives the readers a taste of the scale of the Kristallnacht (November 1938): 7,500 Jewish shop windows broken, all synagogues burned, and 20,000 Jewish men incarcerated in concentration camps. In common with many others who wrote during the first two decades after WWII, Arendt (p. 5, 11-12) addresses the issue of Jewish passivity in the face of death during the later roundups and transports to the death camps.<br /><br />Arendt briefly discusses the fate of Jews of some individual European nations. She mentions the conniving of the Bulgarians (with, of course, the implied freedom to do so) performed in order to avoid sending their Jews to the death camps, and the fact that Finland, Germany's ally, was never seriously pressured to turn over her 2,000 Jews to be murdered (p. 170). Clearly, the latter part of the oft-repeated statement, \\"Not all of the victims of the Nazis were Jews, but all Jews were victims of the Nazis\\" is incorrect.<br /><br />Throughout this work, Arendt gives various biographical details of Adolf Eichmann. For example, she mentions that he was a Gottglaubiger (p. 27), a Nazi term for those who had broken with Christianity, and which Eichmann maintained right up to the very moment of his hanging, having refused the solace and Bible reading of a Protestant minister (p. 252).<br /><br />Arendt briefly discusses Hitler's flouting of the Versailles treaty and his rise to power. While Jan T. Gross has asserted that there were Poles who praised Hitler in the 1930's, Arendt makes it clear that this was far from limited to Poland during that time: \\"...Hitler was admired everywhere as a great national statesman.\\" (p. 37).<br /><br />While most recent Holocaust materials focus on the real or imagined collaboration of locals in the sending of Jews to their deaths, Arendt is unsparing in her criticism of Jewish collaborators in this regard: \\"Without Jewish help in administrative and police work--the final roundup of Jews in Berlin was, as I have mentioned, done entirely by Jewish police--there would have been either complete chaos or an impossibly severe drain on German manpower. (p. 117). She adds that, because of this collaboration, only a few thousand Germans, most of whom furthermore only did office work, were able to send hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths (p. 117). Finally, Arendt concludes that: \\"Wherever Jews lived, there were recognized Jewish leaders, and this leadership, almost without exception, cooperated in one way or another, for one reason or another, with the Nazis. The whole truth was that if the Jewish people had been unorganized and leaderless, there would have been chaos and plenty of misery but the total number of victims would hardly have been between four and a half and six million. (According to Freudiger's calculations about half of them could have saved themselves if they had not followed the instructions of the Jewish councils...\\" (p. 125).<br /><br />Arendt (p. 42, 118, etc.) elaborates on the actions of a Jew, Rudolf Kastner (Kasztner). He made a deal with Eichmann in which 1,684 Jews were allowed to go to Palestine in exchange for Kastner's silence before and during which 476,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.<br /><br />Jan Tomasz Gross, who has gotten a great deal of publicity for his books (NEIGHBORS and FEAR), has stated that the 2-3 million Poles who died in the hands of the Germans were largely the collateral victims of military action. Arendt knows better: \\"...Eichmann knew that right behind the front lines all Russian functionaries (\\"Communists\\"), all Polish members of the professional classes, and all native Jews were being killed in mass shootings.\\" (p. 95). \\"At no point, however, either in the proceedings or the judgment, did the Jerusalem trial mention even the possibility that extermination of whole ethnic groups--the Jews, or the Poles, or the Gypsies--might be more than a crime against the Jewish or the Polish or the Gypsy people, that the international order, and mankind in its entirety, might have been grievously hurt and endangered.\\" (pp. 275-276). Arendt realizes the alternative future: \\"The measures against Eastern Jews were not only the result of anti-Semitism, they were part and parcel of an all-embracing demographic policy, in the course of which, had the Germans won the war, the Poles would have suffered the same fate as the Jews--genocide. This is no mere conjecture: the Poles in Germany were already being forced to wear a distinguishing badge in which the \\"P\\" replaced the Jewish star, and this, which we have seen, was always the first measure to be taken by the police in instituting the process of destruction).\\" (pp. 217-218).<br /><br />Arendt praises the Danes for saving Jews during WWII and then, without mentioning the incomparably more difficult conditions under which Polish rescuers of Jews labored, nevertheless gives the Poles their due. After listing some individual examples of Polish assistance to Jews, Arendt adds the following: \\"One witness claimed that the Polish underground had supplied many Jews with weapons and had saved thousands of Jewish children by placing them with Polish families. The risks were prohibitive; there was the story of an entire Polish family who had been executed in the most brutal manner because they had adopted a six-year-old Jewish girl.\\" (p. 231).ment, did the Jerusalem trial mention even the possibility that extermination of whole ethnic groups--the Jews, or the Poles, or the Gypsies--might be more than a crime against the Jewish or the Polish or the Gypsy people, that the international order, and mankind in its entirety, might have been grievously hurt and endangered.\\" (pp. 275-276). Arendt realizes the alternative future: \\"The measures against Eastern Jews were not only the result of anti-Semitism, they were part and parcel of an all-embracing demographic policy, in the course of which, had the Germans won the war, the Poles would have suffered the same fate as the Jews--genocide. This is no mere conjecture: the Poles in Germany were already being forced to wear a distinguishing badge in which the \\"P\\" replaced the Jewish star, and this, which we have seen, was always the first measure to be taken by the police in instituting the process of destruction).\\" (pp. 217-218).

B00004W221|5.0|In this dismal Notre Dame footbal season, thank God we still have Rudy! I am also of Irish descent, and rather short and have always been adamant about proving others wrong when I said I was going to do something and they said I couldn't so I identify rather easily with this film. A wise man once told me talent is overrated, it's hard work that counts. That sums up Rudy. The kid that wanted to play for Notre Dame. While blue-chip, highly recruited, super atheletes stew and mope about not playing and giving half-hearted efforts in practice, Rudy gives it everything he could possibly give and more, all in the hope on one day dressing up in a game uniform and running out of that tunnel on a Saturday afternoon in South Bend while his dad watches on. I feel a tear coming on, I cry every time I watch this film and I ain't much for crying but to see this little man make his dreams come true, it just gets to me. Jon Favreau plays his tutor, mentor and has a great role as watch for Vince Vaughn in a small role. This is where Vince and Jon met and came up with the idea of SWINGERS. Ned Beatty is as always terrific.
0375842381|5.0|Philip Pullman's dark fantasy trilogy, His Dark Materials, ostensibly written for children, is actually literature of a much higher order. The title of the trilogy comes from a particularly powerful passage of Milton's Paradise Lost, the great religious epic poem whose central story is the thematic basis for this trilogy. Another important influence on these three novels is the Christian Parsifal or Sir Percival story, which dates back to the early middle-ages as part of both the King Arthur and the Holy Grail cycle of tales. From its very first page, Pullman's crisp, evocative writing creates a world not quite like ours but just similar enough to be uncomfortable and strangely familiar. As readers of the trilogy know, most of the events in these books do not occur on our world or even in our universe. Of course, because this is post Tolkien fantasy, Mr. Pullman has absorbed all of the usual fantasy tropes and has no desire to repeat them. So what he writes is new, deeper, with fully rounded characters that come alive on the page. His courageous young heroine, Lyra Belacqua with her daemon familiar, Pantalaimon, always by her side, is one of the great creations in \\"children's literature\\". Lyra and Pan make an especially entertaining, often very amusing, pair. Her fearsome Uncle, Lord Asriel, is one of those rich, ambiguous creations that keep you guessing as to their motives, reminiscent of Professor Snape in J. K. Rowling's Potter novels. Pullman's writing is lean and well crafted and exciting to read. Once started, it is very difficult to set aside.<br /><br />This three volume boxed set contains the books in hardcover with their original dustcovers. Their artwork is lovely. It also contains a map: a necessity in today's complex world of fantasy. The first volume, The Golden Compass, has been filmed and was recently released on DVD. The two succeeding books, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, will presumably follow thereafter. This set makes a lovely gift for an older and mature reading child or an adult who still retains memories of childhood and all of its dark mysteries. Strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmaner and mature reading child or an adult who still retains memories of childhood and all of its dark mysteries. Strongly recommended.    Mike Birman
0061120073|5.0|I'm so glad that I decided to read this book. I'd initially purchased it because it was on sale (and I really needed something new to read). Nonetheless, this book has become one of my, if not all time, favorite novels. The characters and situations are so real, and I'm a firm believer that ANYONE (male or female, young or old) can somehow relate to Francie Nolan. In this day and age where the youth seldomly read and are exposed to terrible mediums of entertainment (reality tv--Paris Hilton??) we need books such as \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\\" It's so genuine and full of spirit and heart, despite the characters' dismal situations. This book has the ability to inspire readers to live their lives with integrity and to persevere--especially in seemingly hopeless situations.
080701429X|5.0|This is the best book I have read! It is: easy to read, a nice blend of thoughts and drama, inspiring, and comes with great ideas. I recommend it to everyone.
B000001FSR|1.0|Tom Waits definitely inspires extreme opinions.  Many of my friends think he is one of the all-time greats.  For me, the emperor has no clothes.  One star is being kind.<br /><br />However, it's not enough to just say this album is one of the worst I've ever heard.  It's not enough to say Tom Waits is a pretentious fop.  It's not enough to say that he sings just like Cookie Monster.<br /><br />Those are all cheap shots and name-calling, which you can easily find on the message boards of TMZ.com and ESPN.com.  No, my challenge here is to explain why I hate Franks Wild Years, in clear and precise language that will change your mind.  A thesis on the musical stinkery of Waits that will make you realize you've been living a lie.<br /><br />Of course, I can type and type and type, and it will all be in vain.  You'll all laugh and snicker, and shake your heads sadly at me and tell me I don't get it.  And you know what?  I don't.  I boldly assert my own ignorance of the supposed genius of Tom Waits, the two-bit troubadour.<br /><br />So let's examine the themes of Franks Wild Years, which Waits desperately, almost pathologically wants you to explore.<br /><br />Of course, this is more than just an album.  It's \\"Un Operachi Romantico In Two Acts\\", and completes a trilogy of albums.  Really, Tom?  I'm already not feeling very smart now that I've entered your whimsical world.  Sorry I missed the play that accompanied this very important piece of art.  Maybe then I would truly understand it.  Right now I am just hearing some accordions, some off-key horns, that gravelly, straight-from-Skid-Row voice of yours, and I'm already getting upset.<br /><br />Franks Wild Years tells the story of Frank, a doomed loser dyin' to get out of his one-horse town and go \\"straight to the top\\" (NOTE TO TOM:  Springsteen already covered this lyrical ground about 12-15 years prior).  Actually, Waits' lyrics by themselves are kinda like a more arty Springsteen (Mary's on the black top/There's a husband in the dog house), but WAY more pretentious.<br /><br />I mean, what is Waits actually trying to say?  I mean, I get that he's an avant-garde poet extraordinaire.  Jeez, that's beaten over my head with each song.  \\"Look!  Here's a cheesy waltz!  Now look!  I'm familiar with Django Reinhardt and you're not!  Wait, there's more!  I'm like Sinatra, only I'm off-key and drunk!  I literally can create an entire cast of characters with clever wordplay in one album -- sorry, I meant in UN OPERACHI ROMANTICO IN TWO ACTS.\\"<br /><br />But even that musical chameleon quality of Waits doesn't accurately explain my hatred.  Waits definitely creates music on his own terms.  He doesn't come to you, but instead makes you come to him.  I'm sorry, but I hate that about artists.  Music has to be a two-way street.  Unusual does not equal good.  The only mood that Waits creates for me, anyway, is \\"What kind of garbage am I listening to?\\"<br /><br />The album is WAY too long.  How pretentious of Waits to play us two versions of two different songs!  It's like he is saying, \\"Did you enjoy my genius on the first rhumba version on Side One -- sorry, I meant in Act I?  Now sit back and MARVEL at how effortlessly I can switch to a Vegas version! What a poignant commentary I am making on the broken promises of the Sin City!\\"<br /><br />No, Tom, it's just long!  I already heard this song!  Just get to the end of the record and let me get back to my Kinks albums!<br /><br />I'm not going to go song by song here, cause I rate them all 0 out of 10.  All of them.  However, special dishonorable mention must go to \\"I'll Take New York\\", which I give negative 1,000 out of 10.  The U.S. Army should set up giant speakers throughout the mountains of Afghanistan, and just play that song at ear-splitting volume on a continuous loop.  The Taliban would be completely flushed out in about a day.<br /><br />I expect I will be skewered by the Waits-lovers on here, but bring it on.  The truth deserves to beheard.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Not only was the animation the best I've seen yet from Pixar, but the story of Remy the French rat trying to be a 1st class chef was great. Amazing performances, great action which surprised me. I absolutely love this movie! Easily the best Pixar movie to date w/ The Incredibles a close 2nd. Can't wait to pick up the Full HD 1080P Video & Linear PCM Audio Blu-ray disc of Ratatouille!
B000OYC7A8|3.0|I'm going to write a quick \\"buyer beware\\" review of this on.     1. The content itself is impeccable.  The live Echoes alone is worth the price of admission.  On an Island live is also fantastic.  This is the best live Floyd related release ever.  Better than Pulse.  Better than Roger's DVD.  The music and visuals are that good . . .     2. . . . if the disc actually works.  Mine doesn't.  It's not scratched or anything, but it's failed on two DVD players.  It plays just fine till Fat Old Sun.  Then it skips like mad.  Its unable to play most of Fat Old Sun, any of Coming Back to Life, or the first half of High Hopes.  And looking on a few message boards, I'm not the only one with this problem.
0553801503|3.0|Not since the Lord of the Rings has an author written a series that has such amazing SCOPE as GRRM has pulled together with these books.  While arguments will be made for YEARS about the contributions of Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind and others, it seems hard to place them in the same league simply because I consider those books good and entirely worth reading, but Martin has created one of the few Fantasy series that can also be considered true Literature.  Again, some may disagree, but that is essentially how I consider it.<br /><br />I finished this book quite a long time ago and while I normally post my reviews within a day or so of closing the last page, I kept putting this one off as I attempted to just figure out exactly what I thought of it.  I believe the bulk of us Song of Ice & Fire readers have all heard that this book originally began as a single novel, and due to several unforseen circumstances, ended up being divided into two separate-but-equal parts of basically the same book.  You can REALLY tell, too.  The obvious omitting of several MAJOR POV's is the first and biggest obstacle against giving this a full 5 Stars.  As MANY have also noted, even though there ARE some incredibly important issues brought up which help the plot move forward here, again it is nearly impossible NOT to notice how LITTLE forward the book takes us overall.  Several reviewers have noted the possible absence of an editor with the stones to actually trim the fat, which this novel really needed.  I would have rather waited an extra year and had what was cut out to make 'A Dance With Dragons' ADDED and then properly edited in order to seriously move the overall storyline AHEAD.  There is little doubt that GRRM is likely the most talented Fantasy Author writing today (although the debate continues...), but if this series is expected to finish up before the end of the next century, I sincerely hope that GRRM steps up the pace--even if by just a little.  Robert Jordan recently passed away, and so far (at least as I write this) the end of the Wheel of Time Series remains unfinished...now he may have finished writing the last novel before he passed away (gosh I hope so...) we can see what happens by doing this and dragging things out longer than necessary.  While I honestly believe GRRM really DOES have a handle on where the story is going and he honestly does know the end from the beginning, I also hope that the end is in sight.  Making us all wait what seems like decades in between these books is nothing short of torture and possibly against the Geneva Convention if I am not mistaken...<br /><br />With that said, I STILL had a great time reading AFFC.  Yes it dragged and lost momentum and I felt that my journey was basically 'Hurry Up And Wait', I have invested so much into these characters, (although through sad experience I have also discovered not to become TOO attached to any one character in particular) that even a SMALL glimpse into their world is better than none at all.  I anxiously await the arrival of the 2nd half of this tale begun in 'A Feast For Crows', I also bite my nails wondering if part 2 isn't just more of the same here.  I have learned to give the benefit of the doubt in a lot of instances, and because GRRM is so dang good at writing, I feel compelled to extend it here as well.  But hopefully my patience won't have to be tested quite to this degree much longer...and so far (at least as I write this) the end of the Wheel of Time Series remains unfinished...now he may have finished writing the last novel before he passed away (gosh I hope so...) we can see what happens by doing this and dragging things out longer than necessary.

B00004VVNB|3.0|Saw this years ago and really dug the thought that 2007 or 08 might look like this. I'd be dead with the \\"terminate life at 30 years\\" rule that is one of the foundations of the futuristic society here, but still when I saw this I was sure domed utopian cities and monorails everywhere were just around the bend.  Intersting enough premise about future society where all life ends after 30 years old, a law enforced by  \\"Sandmen\\" who grab those in their late 29's and take them to a ritualized slaughter called \\"Carosuel\\". Michael York plays a Sandman who has his own doubts and suspicions when his number comes up.  The effects and the plot look bad thirty-some years later. Effect wise, the chinks in the armor show soon, with a neat little future city shown with a lake that ripples like a baby pool. A then modern shopping mall was used as the city interior and it's pretty hard to force oneself to believe that there's not an Orange Julius or a Spencers Gifts just around the bend.  Basil Expostion..I mean Michael York is not convincing, particularly in the final scenes. Peter Ustinov is unbearable and I wonder if he was as old and feeble in real life at the time as was his role.  If you like sci-fi and BAD sci-fi, it's not without merit. Like bad Christmas decorations-most of us still like to see 'em....
B00000729S|5.0|Black Monk Time is definitely a 60s garage record, but it doesn't sound like a 60s garage record. It doesn't sound like anything that came before, and it sure as hell doesn't sound like anything since. There's really no describing this record in a just way; you just have to experience it.    One of the \\"best\\" and \\"most important\\" records ever made. No freakin' joke.
6305922756|5.0|If you're not a fan of British hard album rock from 20-30 years ago, you might not get the jokes. But if you love bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple,Black Sabbath, Uriah Heap and so on, this \\"rockumentary\\" hits on so many unintentionally comical traits of that rock genre and fans.  The music is sometimes listenable, I am embarrassed to admit humming \\"Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You\\" more than once.  If you've only seen it once or if it was a while back, check it out again- there are many little hidden gags (cold sores,spilling cocaine,Yoko influence) that I didn't catch at the late show where I first saw this gem...
B00000JTB2|4.0|Great CD - great songs, great performances, and interesting dialogue clips between some tracks.  Highlights are Stormy Monday, Pride and Joy (SRV's only vocal), and the long, simmering Blues at Sunrise.    I bought this CD primarily because of SRV, however, after I couldn't stop listening to it over and over again, I started collecting several Albert King titles - the classic Born Under a Bad Sign, Hard Bargain, Live Wire, the Stax Profile.  All are consistently excellent and recommended if you enjoy this session.
0790729725|5.0|Go to the bathroom and have your snacks ready BEFORE you pop this disc in, you will not want to leave during this very fast paced and rewarding 2 hours of gripping drama.  Dialogue is great,action served up stylishly and tense mood of ambitious and motivated Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is captured brilliantly. Hill is a man with a million things on the to-do list, very few of them legal or moral. Even the romantic scenes where he meets his wife (Lorraine Bracco), an area where directors do an obligatory slowdown, have  a fast pulse.  If I can criticize anything about this fine film, it would be-  *There is no Harvey Keitel cameo.   *The accuracy of the tales of real life mobster/writer Henry Hill are disputed; after all he did become a government informer, and snitches often have low credibility.  *There is a coke deal scene in a crummy motel-with the windows WIDE open-guess Marty needed the lighting more than the dope dealers needed their privacy!  Regardless of my nitpicks, this is one of my top 20 favorites of all time.

I have a personal bias toward \\"Song Remains the Same\\" as it was my first sights of Zep live. That said, these are both worthy projects. This one offers a greater time frame than \\"Song Remains the Same\\" that is limited to one show in 1973. Here you'll find shows and clips from shows in Scandanavia, Tampa,Florida, London, the Knebworth Festival- a great collection of the bands strong years little of the later fade.

0786930640|1.0|I will keep this short.    In style and use of the English language I would have to call this one of the worst books I've read in years.    The characters were intriguing and somewhat endearing but the plot rambled on like a bad road trip.  Its simplistic writing kept me wondering if I'd picked the book out of the juvenile section.  Compared to the work of Martin or Bakker, which I consider astounding, it is extraordinarily transparent.  The punctuation, especially the overuse of of exclamation marks in narrative no less, along with inconsistencies and awkward analogies kept reminding me that I was reading a book rather than being allowed to be carried away by the story.    In short, don't waste your time.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Deep down in the oceans in the wonderous kingdom of Atlantica where the Mer-Folk live, a beautiful Mermaid princess named Ariel always dreams of living on the land with humans for she believes that they are not dangerous as her strict father says they are. One lucky night, she rescues a human prince named Eric from drowning and falls in love with him. With the help of her friends Flunder and lovable Reggae crab Sabastian, they want to help her dreams come true as they seek the sea witch Ursula who makes a deal with her to sell her voice and to make her human, but if she can get the kiss of true love then she will be human forever and if she doesn't within three days then she will become a Mermaid again and will belong to Ursula forever. She does the deal for now she is speechless (literally) and is human, she is taken in by the prince she desires and they both begin a relationship that seems magical, although Ursula is jealous as now she wants vengeance and the kingdom to herself until Ariel must stop her.<br /><br />One of Disney's most beloved and magical movies of all time! sure after \\"Black Cauldron\\" and \\"Great Mouse Detective\\" flopped in theaters and \\"Oliver and Company\\" being a minor hit in 1988, it wasn't until late 1989 when this motion picture based on Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale become a major blockbuster for the disney studios and proved to be the ultimate ray of hope. The animation is nothing sort of breathtaking considering it took 4 years to make with some early CGI and excellent voice acting by Jodi Benson (Perfectly gorgeous voice), Pat Carrol as Ursula, Rene Aubejenos as the goofy French chef, Buddy Hackett as the moronic but charming Scuttle, Ben Wright as Grimbsy, and Samuel E. Wright as the show-stopping crab Sabastian. It won two oscars and become a true milestone in disney animation for a long time thanks to the unique songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, a must see! Ariel is quite an animated dish and guaranteed to make any man drool.<br /><br />This 2-Disc special edition DVD offers quality picture and sound with excellent extras like audio commentary, behind the scenes footage, a look behind the special effects, deleted scenes, art and photo galleries, music videos, and more in this must have DVD for any animation fan.his 2-Disc special edition DVD offers quality picture and sound with excellent extras like audio commentary, behind the scenes footage, a look behind the special effects, deleted scenes, art and photo galleries, music videos, and more in this must have DVD for any animation fan.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|First of all; FIVE stars.  I loved, loved, loved it!  I hated, hated, hated it!  It couldn't have been better!  I'll explain.  (And a spoiler warning)     I loved that Serenity and crew were flying again! \\"Serenity\\" picks up the story at a point where the crew is embarking on almost a crucible of a sort; no one's coming out the same. Some may not come out at all.  While darker than the series, \\"Serenity\\" still retained most of what I loved about \\"Firefly\\".   The cast, characters, the story and the style were as welcome as old friends.  Heists, Reavers, government assassins and conspiracies, and the \\"truth about River\\" (alas, it appears we will never know the tantalizing truth about another mysterious character); my husband and I enjoyed it immensely.  For an hour and a half, all was right in my `verse.    During this rather dark chapter, I missed the humor that was more prevalent in the series.  The length of the film prohibited the quieter kind of individual moments between characters that I found appealing and gave them cliché-killing depths (Before live-in-the-moment-mercenary  Jane's conversation with Book in the Firefly episode, \\"The Message\\", who would have pictured him giving much thought to his life, death, or God. Or giving much thought to anything really!).  But this movie deals with hard times on Serenity.  As with many of my favorite shows, books, or movies, at the end I had the feeling that the story could not have been done better any other way.  \\"Whedon and Co.\\" are Storytellers; they have stories to tell and they know how to do it.  A smart network or studio would just get out of their way and let them do what they do.    (Warning Mini-Spoiler coming)  Before the movie's release, I dreaded the rumored loss of any of the main characters.   I've always found it difficult to choose a \\"favorite\\" character; they all appealed at different times for different reasons (a rare hallmark of good writing and acting).  Dramatically speaking, it did raise tension; literally no one was safe.  (Still, something in me insists that it sucks.)  But all is (almost.... mostly...) forgiven. I'll miss those irreplaceable characters and what they added to the mix (One has always reminded me of someone very special in my real life).  But most of all, I hate, hate, hate that this is the end of the story.

0375701427|4.0|I read Philip Roth's, \\"The Plot Against America\\" and \\"Goodbye, Columbus.\\"  With these books in mind, I started \\"American Pastoral\\" expecting Roth's prolixity, as well as such themes as American Jewish identity, factious race and class relations, sex, and Newark, NJ.  American Pastoral, in many beautiful sentences and passages, has this and much more.<br /><br />Roth skillfully guides the reader through Seymour \\"the Swede\\" Levov's life.  The Swede has everything: a beautiful wife and endearing daughter, an idyllic home in the country and a prosperous company, not to mention good looks.  He is the epitome of the American dream. Then his gentle daughter, Merry, turns into a revolutionary fanatic and blows his pastoral life up with a bomb.<br /><br />Such a tragedy is needed to reveal that the American dream is just a dream.  Many Americans live under the conception that anything is possible, dreams do come true, and hard work pays off.  The founding fathers encouraged such thinking and it has helped our country greatly.  Such thinking is ideal but isn't always realistic.<br /><br />Things go wrong.  People go crazy.  Some, like Merry, bomb a local post office to protest the Vietnam War.  Viewing America only in the pastoral light is willfully ignoring the bad stuff.  Many people wish to see their country as an Eden-like place, a pasture (I admit, I do at times).  But by doing this they are closing their eyes, covering their ears, and keeping out any negative, perverse reality that actually exists.  Life isn't carefree nor has it ever been.  In American Pastoral, Roth forces his reader to take in all the craziness of the world and deal with it.<br /><br />Read American Pastoral.

0060849827|5.0|I love survival and have a ton of survival references. I have both the \\"Survival Handbook\\" and the \\"Survival Guide\\", by Lofty. The Handbook is by far the best reference I have found. Most other survival books are just knock-offs of old Army survival manuals. The Guide is an abreviated version of the Handbook. The Guide is an excellent size to carry with your survival kit. Most of what is cut out of the Guide is foundation to make for easier reading and is not very noticable unless you actually compare each book side-by-side. There are a few exceptions. To save space, some of the pictures of useful plants that are in the Handbook are missing from the Guide.<br />Overall, a solid buy!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|...AbsolutelyPositively Stunning!    Try not to sit there in complete awe as Gilmour and his band (and a few guests) flawlessly execute the entire ON AN ISLAND album, as well as a goodly portion of PF material that will have you scratching your head and saying to yourself...Hmmm...Waters / Gilmour...Gilmour / Waters...    I was a bit skeptical of this offering initially, and having seen Roger Waters and HIS band back in June, I was prepared to accept Gilmour's show as \\"another\\" in their little back and forth.    But I realize, and happily, that there's more than enough room for the two of them, and you can never get enough great music, no matter who's interpreting it.    The full-length ECHOES alone is worth the cost of this package.    What does that tell ya?    And when rock royalty (Gilmour) invites Rock Royalty (David Bowie) in to participate...you feel a bit privileged just to be a part of the action.    A stunning package and a must-have for any David Gilmour or PF fan.    One thing that does puzzle me tho' is this...why does he virtually ignore the first two solo records...DAVID GILMOUR and ABOUT FACE?    I'd love to hear anything from either of those two albums.    BUT.........I ain't complaining...jessaskin'...    ...is all.    Enjoy.

Ian Rider was too careful.  He wasn't careless enough to die in a car crash.  As Alex inspects his uncle's car, he discovers bullet holes.  Bullet holes in a car crash?  What's happening?  As Alex is almost crushed, then cut, then pulverized in a compacter, he also notices a label, Royal & General Bank, supposedly the bank Ian Rider works for.  It seems unlikely, but what other clue does Alex have?  He finds Royal & General, and discovers that his Uncle's whole life was a lie.  He takes a job for them, but it's far from banking as you can get.  As the book unfolds, Alex in whisked away on a crazy adventure for Britain's best, and most secretive, intelligence agency that he, and readers, will never forget.  The nonstop action and adventure in this series will leave you wanting more Rider.  It did for me.  I thought these books were amazing; so what did I do?  I read the next one.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes action, adventure, or cool gadgets.    Matthew H.  Grade 6  Ms. Kawatachi
B000001ESP|3.0|For me, this was the beginning of the end for Rush.  The first half of the album is what I've come to expect from this super 70s group:  inspired lyrics, sizzling guitar, thumping bass, and, of course, Neil's genius percussions. The second half is just downright lame:  too much synthesizer (Don't get me wrong; I love synthesizers), songs that drag, and half-baked lyrics.  If it weren't for the first half, I'd probably only rate this album with 2 stars maximum.  A farewell to the Rush of 2112 and Hemispheres.
0618680004|2.0|I was disappointed in the book, after reading The Selfish Gene and hearing him in interviews I was excited for this book.  Unfortunately the first half is trying to use science to disprove the existence of God, which misses the entire issue of \\"faith\\" and the fact that believers are hostile to the concept of \\"God needing to prove himself, it is for us to believe not question\\".  Arguing the science of God's existence or lack-there-of is totally futile.  The second half was entertaining and interesting, and almost worth the whole book reading.  Overall I was disappointed.

I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, but this is the lamest excuse for a progressive rock album since Yes in the middle 70s.  The lyrics are inane, the songs drag, and David Gilmour's voice gets on my nerves after 15 minutes into the album.  \\"The Final Cut\\" is not inspired either, but this one has even less to offer.

After the lyrical success of their past few albums, I knew it was coming.  Finally here, Into The Wild has to be one of the most mellow CDs that I have ever listened to.  I bought it and just sat in my car, parked in an empty lot, and just listened to the CD (it's only a little over half an hour long).  I can't wait to see the movie if this CD will accompany it.
B000001GS0|3.0|Beware of the mono sound which is too much for me to really enjoy these performances unfortunately. I am not someone who needs the latest digital, noise-free performance either however.     For a great Brahms 1 - get the Karajan \\"DG original\\" coupled with Schumann's 1st symphony. It is truly a wonderful performance and the bass in the opening first movement is powerful. Ignore David Hurwitz's comments on this symphony. Walter on Sony is also superb for 1st through 3th symphonies.     As many have already said, Kleiber for Brahms 4 is the standard although some like Karl Sanderling's 4th too.

1567315682|5.0|This book isn't really an economics book and it is not about the super wealthy as a social radical would define that group. It is a cute book and it is reassuring to those of us who really aren't all that wealthy but have watched our pennies and been reasonably conservative in our spending habits.<br />It follows the misleading old adage that if you wish to be \\"something\\" study those who have already become what you would like to be and follow their example. This rarely works and is a very boring, non-creative, yet common behavior practiced by almost everybody. This is why we have a never ending variety of burger stands, shopping malls, rap hoodlums, celebrities, writers and movie stars who all look, sound, and act alike everywhere we turn.<br />I was very pleased to find out that I was actually wealthier than I thought I was and that most of my neighbors think that I am.<br />I was nevertheless pleased to learn that most of \\"us\\" wealthy people believe that a penny saved is a penny earned; that it is not what you earn but what you are able to save that counts; and that charity should begin at home. I think that's all true - my wife disagrees with at least two of the above.<br /><br />Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />\\"A Summer with Charlie\\"
B000NDIAWO|1.0|Okay Beyoncé, I admire your motivation and drive but to think you are serving the latino audience is absurd. Think about it... The writing is on the wall... GREED..... A talented singers but shame, shame I know Shakira inspires you but there is only one SHAKIRA that is able to crossover and succeed. Take a break and find yourself and your craft because you are lost...Where is Beyoncé??.. Stick with the original release.
B00005JPRF|3.0|\\"Project Alice, activate\\": these words were spoken by Iain Glen at the very end of \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse,\\" and it set into motion the premise behind the next chapter, \\"Resident Evil: Extinction.\\" Or at least, it set into motion one of the premises, which is somewhat annoying. This is an action/horror/science fiction film that's overly condensed and needlessly complicated, with an intricate structure that was improperly handled. What we have here is a rare case: a movie that actually needed an extra thirty minutes for every plot point to be clear and resolvable. There's no point in criticizing the heavy stunts, the excessive gore, and the unrealistic story; I expected nothing less from an adaptation of a video game. But when it comes to character development, pacing, and stability, there is something to complain about.    The film opens the same way that many films starring Milla Jovovich do: by her awakening half naked in a strange place, confused but able to stay in control. Her character, Alice, now finds herself lying on the floor of a shower, wearing nothing but a plastic curtain. She then dons a red dress and attempts to escape; based on the sterile hallways and the advanced technology, it's clear that she's once again being held at the Umbrella Corporation's research facility, a laboratory built deep under Raccoon City. As she reaches a doorway, she's gunned down by a cleverly hidden booby trap. We're meant to think that the main character has already been killed off, but wait a minute--her body is dumped in an open grave filled with Alices, each one wearing the same red dress. Somehow, our genetically altered heroine has been cloned, and the ones that die end up in a mass grave.    At this point, we're given an insightful (if brief) update as to the state of things, courtesy of Alice's narration. Apparently, the Umbrella Corporation's attempt to quarantine Raccoon city and eradicate the dreaded T Virus failed. It actually managed to spread throughout theentire world. Remember that the T Virus can re-animate dead tissue and mutate living tissue, in essence turning anything it infects into a flesh-eating zombie; an epidemic of this scale has collapsed governments and laid waste to heavily populated cities. The virus has also destroyed plant life and lakes, meaning that the earth is now a planet of desert continents. The world as we knew it is over.    Those that survived have learned to stay on the move, because remaining in one area will only attract the infected. This is how we find Alice; she travels alone across the deserts of the Western United States on a motorcycle, stopping only for gas, weapons, and an encounter with a sadistic family of mutant-dog owners. We also meet a mobile group lead by Claire (Ali Larter), a dedicated, efficient young woman. Joining her are \\"Apocalypse\\" survivors Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps). They reunite with Alice as they're being attacked by a swarm of infected crows; it would seem that her genetic modifications have allowed for supernatural powers, such as forming force fields and spreading fire. How these powers developed is never adequately explained, but whatever the reason, she uses both abilities to save the remaining group.    That's when they decide to head for Alaska, a state so isolated that it's possibly not infected. But before they can make such a long, difficult journey, they have to stop for supplies. And since every small town has been drained of its resources, they're forced to rely on a major city, which is most likely swarming with zombies. They settle for Las Vegas, which has since been consumed by the desert.    Meanwhile, back at the Umbrella Corporation, the overdriven Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is desperately trying to track Alice down. Because her body has been able to tolerate the T Virus, he believes that her blood is the key to finding a cure, one that may be able to \\"domesticate\\" the infected. Unfortunately, his slew of Alice clones has failed to be effective. Effective in what way, I'm not entirely sure; I still haven't figured out why they were needed in the first place. There might have been an explanation hidden somewhere in the film, but with a story this dense and meandering, I can't help but believe that I missed a couple of things.    Such with the way with \\"Resident Evil: Extinction,\\" an overly ambitious film that tried to fit too much into too small a space. The battle sequences are fun, and the makeup effects make for more than a few genuinely frightening moments. Milla Jovovich gives yet another decent performance as an action heroine (although I'm beginning to wonder if she's capable of playing any other role). Missing from the equation is a cohesive, well-developed story, something adequately suited for a film only ninety-five minutes long. When the fourth film is released--since the end of \\"Extinction\\" makes it clear that Alice's story is far from over--I can only hope that the vague plot points and unanswered questions will be dealt with. Of course, I'll also be wondering if the story will ever come to an end; movies like this prove that words like \\"extinction\\" have no finality to them whatsoever.
B000BCE918|5.0|Recently I started thinking about my grand children in the future. I immediately ordered three boxed sets I would like to share with them in the future. The Jurrassic Park trilogy was one of them because of the excellent special effects that brings a part of the past to real life. The prehistric creatures are brought to life and put in situations with real people so we can relate to the size they actually were and the perils of survival for our ancient ancestors. Great Movies I look forward to sharing with my grand children someday.
0895260131|5.0|A MUST READ for every person living in Western Civilization! This book exposes this 'religion' as the expansionist political movement it is and the underground quiet revolution that is taking place using our legal system, our schools, our media, our gullibility and the mathematical inevitabilty of population demographics to impose their will on our society.   Even right thinking Muslims who practice only the spiritual and moral precepts by which they live their lives I doubt know the underlying and nefarious principles of Islam. And if they do shame on them for not publicly rejecting them.  Eye opening reading. Spend the money to buy this book. The more you know about Islam will allow you see through the politically correct smokescreen that the Islamist apologists (CAIR), our media and our government is putting forth. Our civilization and the future of your grandchildren are at stake. Buy it but more importantly read it cover to cover and then pass it on to a neighbor or friend.

B00005U122|4.0|I like this concert: excellent music, serious musicianship, good arrangements and sound and of course, Roger Waters. However in some parts, as in the awesome 'Dogs', I miss Gilmour very much (in the legendary 1977 bootleg, Pink Floyd plays an amazing live version of this song). But of course that is thing of the past and Gilmour is not an easy treat to imitate, it is very good to see this guys solo playing Floyd backed by very good musicians, is better than nothing; also, Waters' solo songs are excellent here, I recommend this DVD to any serious rock fan.    Anyway let me tell you, I saw Waters live this year playing Dark Side of the Moon along with some songs of this In The Flesh set, and it was so much better than this DVD, in every aspect, specially sound and lighting with flying pig wandering over the city skies! I hope that the latest tour gets DVD treatment as this excellent production.
0345494768|5.0|I think I've been waiting 30 years for this book.  It is excellent and packed with really cool behind the scene photos and notes.  It is exactly as it should be given the lack of \\"marketing\\" tools of movies back in the late 70's.  It has a lot of information and will add nicely to any Star Wars collection for years to come.
0767847431|5.0|Just a quick note to anyone who sees this: as usual, these are not the true widescreen presentations.  If you watch the full screen presentation and pick any scene with good border definitons, and then find the same scene in the widescreen version, you'll notice the edges have been edited over with black to create a widescreen appearance.  In other words, instead of viewing MORE visual borders of these movies, the widescreen print is actually presenting much LESS than what was filmed.  Stick with the fullscreen viewings so you don't miss anything.
B000RJO578|3.0|This is one of those movies that starts out great, in fact, the first hour & 25 minutes are fabulous & very witty!!     Then this movie goes down hill and fast, as the last 30 minutes were the cheesiest and most unbelievable ever! The last 30 minutes of this movie totally ruined this movie for me. It just didn't jive with how the main character would act or the rest of the movie in general.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|Like Robert Koehl states in his review, I also have gone thru 2 discs because of the skipping issue.On the second disc I can get thru most of Fat Sun with a couple of skips but the next song (Coming Back to Life) is unplayable.High Hopes plays fine for me.    as far as the concert goes... it is great.I have much more appreciation for On A Island after seeing it played. David is the master of the spaced blues guitar.Echoes is better than the original to me and I like the understated \\"Shine\\" with the vocals of Crosby and Nash. You can't help but notice that all the musicians are smiling alot during the concert.    Even with the skips I would not hesitate to buy this dvd.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|If you have ever loved pink floyd, you would have to be deaf or dead not to fall in love with this concert.<br />The quality of the music, the enormous amount of material, Crosby, Nash and David Bowie, David Gilmour<br />Rick Wright, Jon Carin - I thought I had died and went to heaven.The inclusion of a full length rendition of Echoes live on DVD is worth about twice the cost of this DVD.<br /> This is the best music DVD released since Pulse. God bless you David, keep making music for this<br />old Floyd freak.

0143038419|5.0|The fact that some people have rated this fantastic book as a 1 star-read is proof that you can't please all the people all the time. I found the book to be an amazing read on many different levels, but the most inescapable fact is that this author is just a gifted writer. She has the ability to transport you with her prose and make you forget that you are reading a book. A definite 5-star book if ever there was one.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's third release is somewhat different from his first two.  It showcases a matured artist miles away from the pop soundings of No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland from [[ASIN:B00005OAIE Room for Squares]].  This album improves upon the style and mood of his second release [[ASIN:B0000ALSDR Heavier Things]].    The CD begins with the wonderful Waiting for the World to change.  A nice mix for John Mayer that showcases his songwriting and musical skills.  In fact, the lyrics in this CD top everything he's ever done, especially Waiting on the World to Change and Belief.    My other favorites include: I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You), Belief, Vultures, and Slow Dancing In A Burning Room.    An incredible masterpiece.    Highly recommended.

B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather contains two of the greatest movies ever made and one extremely well done follow-up.  The first movie contains, arguably, the best cast ever.  Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall.  This alone is worth the price.  It's famous and still exciting with a near three hour runtime.    The second film builds on where the first left off and is my favorite in the series.  Robert De Niro adds to the cast but Marlon Brando does not return and James Caan is only seen in a flashback.  The contrast of Vito's rise to power and Michael loss is wonderfully scripted, acted, and directed.  Vito's scenes alone could be an excellent movie.    The third features Michael, an old man, trying to keep a hold on his business, and family with the ever changing times.  Robert Duvall is no longer there, but Andy Garcia plays the most of his part.  Some of the third movie's casting choices are a problem but it is still a very enjoyable, well acted, directed movie.    The fourth disc is the real thing here.  The many featurettes, additional scenes, and Coppola's notes are what pushes this product past the single discs.  It definitely a must have for the three movies alone, but the additional disc makes it a must buy right now.  If you don't have this you are missing out on one of the best, if not the best, movies off all time.    Definite Must Have.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Mystic River is a director's dream when it comes to the cast.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon all give excellent performances in this flawed masterpiece.  The supporting casts exemplifies the material perfectly.  One of the best of 2003.    This particular DVD is such and upgrafe from the barebones disc.  The DVD features a commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon and a few featurettes.  Also included in this three disc release is the film's soundtrack.    Must Have.
B000LPS4BQ|3.0|A fun adventure, every character was casted perfectly, you can see it when the gang is together, it feels like a group of friends. Now that it is in high def you can enjoy the small amount of special effects that Scooby-doo offers. Overall this is great family film for the growing high definition age.
B000070IXT|5.0|Those who panned this movie need to watch something else.  I am a devoted fan of the genre and this is right up there with \\"Dead Alive\\", \\"Return of the Living Dead\\", \\"Cronos\\", and \\"28 Days Later\\".  Add the babe Milla and it tops the list.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I had high hopes for this film because I've enjoyed Tarantino's work in the past.  I don't know WHAT he was thinking with this.  What a mess.  Many of the action scenes were actually boring as they went on and on.  Tarantino beats us over the head again and again with the whole revenge theme.  Yes...We get it!  I hope this isn't a sign that Tarantino has lost his edge because Kill Bill 2 was just as bad.
B00005JPRF|4.0|After the solid debut of the 1st movie of Resident Evil, followed by the terrible follow-up debacle of the 2nd movie in this franchise - Resident Evil: Nemesis - This brand new movie is better than both!    If you liked or loved the 1st movie, and for some horrific reason you liked the 2nd, then you will definately see a HUGE improvement in Extinction.    Alice is back, looking much hotter and better than she did in Nemesis, and her new director - Russel Mulcahy of the original Highlander movie - does a better job than the last 2 directors did, both in action sequences and camera angles and showing us a grander scale of the earth now in a post-holocaust scenario.    Resident Evil:Extinction feels like classic pulp post-holocaust-zombie fest, in the grand style of a more modernistic Max Max meets 28 Days Later. The mutants and zombies are well done, the action sequences get better and better, despite some of the lacksidasical characterization.     But if you are a gamer, and not a hardcore reader, and like above average B-movie zombie action/adventure type movies - then Extinction will definately fill your bloody bill!    Mulcahy's directive style is truly unique, both in scenic beauty and savage bloodlust. The movie is paced very well, with nary a dull moment.     And the ending is different, along with new powers that Alice is embued with, and a stand-off with the lead mad scientist played by the same actor in the last 3 installments.     Bottom line is: For both fans of S. D. Perry's fun novels, and for the gamers who still think the movies are still too different than the games, both audiences will agree that Extinction mixes both medias well, and truly stands alone as just a fun and exciting and top-notch zombie action movie.    Let's hope for another stunning sequel. The movie is smart in leaving it wide open for one. And with solid writers, actors and directors like this onboard, then the thriving audiences of this franchise will follow...
0743486285|5.0|As a public defender, I thought I understood addiction.  I have seen what happens to good people who make bad decisions.  It is truly a miracle that Mr. Sixx is alive and not dead or in prison.  I too am a fan and bought the soundtrack which is amazing and brilliant.  The reading and listening are beautiful, but painful.  Listen to \\"girl with the golden eyes\\" and you will hear the most beautiful melody, Michael james' voice is amazing, and lyrically, some of the most devastating words ever written.  While the substance is \\"behind the music\\" style, the texture is rough, these are his words and are real.  Hit you between the eyes real.  Makes you cry and your heart ache real.  Leaves you reeling when its over real.  How can a brilliant, talented, gifted, rich successful rock star end up naked and alone on Christmas \\"watching my holiday spirit coagulate in a spoon?\\"  Nikki does not hold back or glamorize his drug use.  It is a long harsh road to hell.  \\"It takes a funeral to make you feel alive.\\"  Fortunately he found his way back to gift us all with the blessing of understanding.\\"Cross your heart and hope that I don't die.\\"  Only through the understanding and treatment of addiction can we solve many social problems.  Mr. Sixx, you are an activist, a Martin Luther King, and a Gandhi, and you probably don't even know it yet.  Thank you for this gift.  I finally get what addiction is.
0060955775|1.0|This is  NOT literature. If you thought the Da Vinci Code was a great book, you will probably like it. If you're into REAL literature, don't even try. Read something by Saramago instead, now that's a real writer.
1569474680|2.0|The ingredients for a good psychological thriller are all there:  Alice, the mother who's convinced that her newborn baby daughter Florence has been switched with another baby in her own home of all places.  David, her husband, who's convinced his wife has gone mad with post-natal depression and refuses to even acknowledge Alice's doubts.  Vivienne, David's mother, perfect organizer of his and Alice's lives, after the tragic murder of David's first wife, Laura, whom he had divorced some time before.  Felix, David's and Laura's child, is now living with them all at The Elms, Vivienne's huge and stately home.    The alleged kidnapping/switch takes place at The Elms and the police get involved.  This starts off a series of considerations for all involved, including the two police detectives assigned to this peculiar case, Simon and Charlie.  Psycological twists & turns ensue, which also lead to the reopening of Laura's murder case, despite the confession of her killer, now serving a sentence.  A gripping start.    Why the 2 stars then?  I admit I was hooked from the very beginning of this book, which is written in two \\"voices\\": Alice's, self-describing her actions and anguish, whereas the rest of the characters and circumstances are reported as seen from the outside.    Up to a certain point, I would have given this book 4 stars.  What disappointed me was that, upon approaching the end, I realised that the facts had not been fairly and truthfully presented from the beginning.  True, one could still guess and make assumptions -after all, isn't that the... thrill of thrillers?- but in my opinion this book was deceiving for the way it started and ended.  I could tell you in more detail what I refer to specifically, but that would give the story away.  If you buy it, you'll find out.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Perhaps director Shekhar Kapur intended the look of _Elizabeth_ to be dark, with very soft focus and muted colors. To be sure, the original Polygram DVD exhibited all of these traits.    On the other hand, the new Universal DVD has much more vivid color and a brighter look overall. The soft focus remains, but it is still much more detailed than the Polygram version, and only occasionally seems over-enhanced.    The video image is not perfect in the Universal DVD, but I prefer it to the image of the Polygram DVD. The price of the new Universal DVD is certainly an advantage, because the original list price of the Polygram DVD was $34.95.
0385333846|4.0|I'd have to say this is one of the best \\"sci-fi\\" books I've read but honestly I don't think it's really a sci-fi book at all.  It's almost a poem, yet written in easy to understand prose.  It's fantastic but only illustrates the realities and absurdities of day to day living.    This book is quite a unique experience, and even if you hate sci-fi you might pick it up since it's a different experience than the genre implies.  Even satire doesn't seem to sum it up as there is a human warmth here that is absent from many other books labeled \\"satire.\\"
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Kudos on the premise but any discerning movie watcher will be hacked off to no end by the direction the movie goes. It's not clever- it's an unabashed waste of your time.  You can just hear the film makers patting themselves on the back after the \\"twist\\".  Blecch.    Instead of watching this cop-out of a film, use the ninety odd minutes to vacuum your stairs or clean the garage.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I watched it the first time when I was little on Laser Disc. I have the VHS, DVD, and now the latest DVD. The old one does not have the extras.

B000002KY8|3.0|It would not be until his sixth album where Prince struck gold and international superstardom with his 1984 album, \\"Purple Rain\\".  However before \\"Purple Rain\\", Prince was beginning to carve a niche of his own in the music industry.  Prince was one of the leading architects in a music movement known as the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".  The \\"Minneapolis Sound\\"  contained a mixture of Funk, Pop, R&B, and Rock.    In addition to architecting his sound, Prince was making a name for himself on the albums he released.  1979's self titled sophomore album, \\"Prince\\" saw him make a name for himself on the dance floors with the hit single \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\".   1980 saw his third album take a decisive turn away from commercialism with his album \\"Dirty Mind\\" - an album by its title that was infused with many sexually explicit lyrics.  In 1981, Prince continued down the path he started with \\"Dirty Mind\\" and released \\"Controversy\\".  \\"Controversy\\" continued down the road of the explicit lyrics that started with \\"Dirty Mind\\", but now infused politics into the equation.   In \\"Prince\\", \\"Dirty Mind\\", and \\"Controversy\\", Prince would continue to develop the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" while making a name for himself.    It wouldn't be until his fifth album, \\"1999\\" that would really be the breakthrough album for Prince.  \\"1999\\" would perhaps solidify the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" and set the stage for what he would do in \\"Purple Rain\\".   While \\"1999\\" is a breakthrough album, I would stop short at calling it a \\"landmark album\\".    \\"1999\\" was originally released as a double album.  Prince tends to develop a lot of material and as a result, it hasn't really been a problem for him to release an album every one to two years - or to put out a double album.   While \\"1999\\" contains only 11 tracks.,5 of the 11 tracks clock in at over 6 minutes long.    It is worth noting that while this is a double album, it was released as a single CD.   However on certain issues of the CD, one track was omitted - \\"D.M.S.R\\".  Itis a shame that this track was released, because when it comes to the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\", this track is at the core of the sound.  However some versions of the CD do contain this track.    When looking at the \\"1999\\", I almost look at it as a tale of two albums.  There is a \\"Radio Friendly/Commercial\\" portion (first three songs) and there is a \\"Less Commercial\\" (remaining songs) portion.    Each of these portions are representative of the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\", but it would probably be the \\"Less Commercial\\" portion that is more indicative of that sound.   Many people are familiar with the the \\"Radio Friendly\\" portion with the three hit singles \\"1999\\", \\"Little Red Corvette\\", and \\"Delirious\\" - all of which were Top 10 singles for Prince.    The best track on this collection is \\"1999\\".   This is a pure masterpiece by Prince for a variety of reasons.  For starters, Prince shares co-vocals with his some of his band mates, \\"The Revolution\\" - namely Lisa Coleman, Jill Jones, and Dez Dickerson.   I've always found Prince to be very strong when he is sharing vocals (i.e. \\"Take Me With U\\" with Apollonia Kotero, \\"U Got the Look\\" with Sheena Easton, and \\"Graffiti Bridge\\" with Mavis Staples are all great examples).   The synthesizers on this song that really are showcased on the chords, but there is still enough of a Funk beat.  While the melody is top-notch, the multiple vocals by Prince and his group demonstrate pure passion giving this song a three dimensional sound.  Dickerson really shines and I'm shocked he didn't end up having a big solo career after leaving the band.  Listen to the extended version on the album that was often omitted on the radio - namely the ending that starts with \\"Party...\\" and goes to \\"....Mommy.  Why does everybody have a bomb?\\"    \\"Delirious\\" is probably the one song that has the least \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" of all of the songs on \\"1999\\".   I've always considered this an average Prince song as well as an average pop song.  Overall, it doesn't have me doing handstands.    The third song that became a hit was \\"Little Red Corvette\\".   This song has more of a Rock feel to it.  It is some of amazing guitar work (It is Dickerson that does the song's guitar solo) that really gives this song the edge.   Like \\"1999\\", there is an extended version of this song not heard on radio.  It is worth noting that Prince builds an analogy of a car and a woman in this song.   While the lyrics aren't very explicit here, it does go on the borderline in this song - particularly on the extended verse not heard on radio.    For the \\"Less Commercial\\" part of the album - as mentioned, this will have much more of a \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" feel.   Overall, it is worth noting the lyrics are much more explicit on this part of the album.  This isn't to judge what Prince is saying here, but just to make the listener aware.    These songs might not be appealing to the Prince fan at first, but they tend to grow on you the more you listen to them.    Prince does mix it up a bit on the \\"Less Commercial\\" part of the album. \\"Automatic\\" does contain a pretty good guitar solo.  \\"All The Critics Love You in New York\\" very much is a song that can be played on the dance floors - past or present.   \\"International Lover\\" has much more of a classic R&B\\" feel to it.   However, the best song on this part of the album is \\"Free\\".   This song almost has a gospel-like melody to it - and Prince pulls it off perfectly.  It might be the one underrated song from this album.    Overall, this album does a good job at representing the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".  Prince fans will enjoy this album.

B000O75F7C|5.0|What do you get when you combine Pink Floyd with Rush and sprinkle in a smidgen of electronic polish? What happens when you take that formula and create a concept album featuring young British harmony's with well crafted melody's which will haunt you all day long until you listen again? I have to wonder if similar thoughts were entertained among the members of Porcupine Tree as they developed  what would become \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\".     Remember what it was like when you first heard Rush \\"2112\\" or Pink's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". Think these comparisons are unrealistic. Perhaps only in the sense that they still fall short of the mark! I've been into Prog Rock since Yes \\"Fragile\\" and I'm going to declare that this is the most excited I've been about a new Prog rock concept album in decades!!! ...and this is the first PT album I've heard! If you are like me and have been hungry for a fresh progressive sound which gives a nod to old school yet blends in the new, you really should get your hands on this one! Just look at the other reviews here. If you have a pulse, you will be hooked just as we are.
B00023B1LC|5.0|What a great action movie!  But it's also about his mental struggle to figure out what's happened.  As the onion peels off layer by layer, we see more than just Bourne, we see those he worked for.    The direction of the movie was great, not heavy handed.  When the police are closing in, Bourne tells the girl to leave him, she'll be safe.  The director has the girl say nothing, she just buckles up her seat belt as if to say \\"I'm with you!\\"
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|The new print looks amazing - theirs plenty more detail, and the sound is also excellent.    It comes in the usual Blu-ray case, but also with an outer slipcase cover.  The 28 or so minutes of deleted scenes are really interesting but are of a lower quality - they have not been added to the film as some had hoped. I'm not complaining, I love the film as it is.    The behind the scenes documentary runs over 70 minutes and looks really interesting from the few minutes I've watched so far.    There's also the original Teaser, and theatrical trailers.    Finally there's a commentary with optional video introduction.    There's supposed to be the trailer for Coppola's new trailer too, so hopefully that'll be good.    Overall I'm really pleased with it. The film hasn't looked or sounded this impressive in years, and at last we have extra features.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I have several copies of this wonderful Cuban Music, one for the car, one for the house, etc.  I have also purchased the DVD on the making of the CD by Ry Cooder.  This is a lasting memory of what was a beautiful era in Cuban Music.  You don't need to understand Spanish to appreciate the glory of the sounds that come out of this band of legends.  A must have for any music collection !
061861169X|4.0|What this book speaks to me about is the magic of Christmas, not the commmercialism, something I try hard to capture each year amid the avalanche of enticements to buy and consume.  I grew up not believing in the Santa that just brings presents but in the magic and spirit of giving and receiving and the joy and wonder of the season and by reading and sharing this book with my family each Christmas, I hope to capture some of that magic and wonder, for each of us to hold in amongst the chaos that surrounds us at this time of year.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|Roman Polanski's finest work takes place in a prewar Los Angeles where everyone has a past they would just as soon keep hidden, where morality is fluid, to say the least, and where respectability is generally always fraudulent. It also happens to be the most interesting film ever made about water...although to the extent that it is really about anything, it mostly seems to be about secrets: the cost of keeping them, what happens once they're in the open, what happens when you try to find them out. As one might expect from the arthouse days of the 1970's, this movie is a bit more intellectual than your average movie, but that's hardly a strike against it. In fact, there have been few films quite as exciting and engaging as Chinatown ever to come out in Hollywood. It has a masterfully-constructed plot, clever-but-still-believable dialogue, virtuosic acting, editing, scoring--it's a rare kind of film that has everything working for it (Citizen Kane is another example) and it single-handedly revived film noir while adding countless new, imaginative touches (such as the infamous Jack Nicholson nose scene). Needless to say, it's a great film. The one question that remains is this:    What does a movie have to do to win a Best Picture Oscar, anyway?    Yes, Chinatown lost to The Godfather, Part II, which is another near-flawless film. Still, the creative staff could, at the time, have savored the fact that it had another parallel to Citizen Kane--both films only won Oscar honors for their screenplays. It's quite a profound drop we've seen in film since 1974--a year where three undeniably great films were nominated for Best Picture (GF II, Chinatown, and The Conversation). These days, it's usually unlikely that even a single Best Picture nominee will have any sort of staying power. It might be the way of things, but watching Chinatown is a way to see that they weren't always this way.    The setup of Chinatown [spoilers] involves a man by the name of Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private investigator who takes a simple job to investigate if a man (a very high-ranking city official) is cheating on his wife. After taking some photographic evidence of the affair (or so he thinks), the man's real wife (Faye Dunaway) comes forward to let Gittes know he's been duped. They try to figure out why Gittes was framed, and the case leads in a number of different directions, most of which involve Dunaway's wealthy, shady father (John Huston), before all the threads come together at the end of the film, which truly has to rank high on any list of the greatest film endings of all time. It's all wrong--not a single person deserves what they get, though it all seems like just a matter of inevitability. [/spoilers]    I'm gratified that we're finally getting a special edition of the film--the edition currently in existence is hardly outstanding. There seems to be little information available about the details as yet, but you owe it to yourself to purchase a copy. This is one of the greatest of all films--it's entertaining, enlightening, and emotionally resonant in a way that few works of art are--it's right up there with Greek tragedy. Seriously.
0634022296|4.0|Well done. All the good songs with guitar chords and words. But the binding is murder. I took it to Kinko's, where they sliced off the binding, punched the book for a 3-hole notebook and slid the cover into the clear envelope on the outside of the binder. Now the black binder lies flat against the music stand and everyone is happy.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt was recently asked which artists material he enjoyed listening to and quickly responded he very much enjoyed the Killers although he frankly admitted he had not yet had an opportunity to pickup or listen to their sophomore effort Sam's Town.  I'd like to point out to Mr. Blunt that when he does get around to it, as is the case with another band with an incredible debut effort, Maroon 5, he is likely to be somewhat disappointed by their follow-up efforts.  Such is not the case with Mr. Blunt.  Having just completed three successive listens, I believe Blunt has outdone his absolutely brilliant debut effort.  He has assembled a talented tight band that shines throughout the album with nary a weak moment.  I imagine his multitalented bass player, Malcolm Moore, who like Blunt possesses a remarkable voice, must be in heaven playing the heavy bass led song 1973, the first of many singles to come off this rich and inspired album.  I eagerly anticipate hearing this new material live at his show next week here in Los Angeles and can only imagine what wonderful James Blunt songs the future  holds for music lovers the world over.  Bravo and thank you very much Mr. Blunt!
B00005JPTA|4.0|From the first frames, \\"Eastern Promises\\" grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.<br /><br />\\"A History of Violence\\" is one of my favorite films. Director David Cronenberg brings together a top-notch cast, including Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello as a married couple living in small town America who has to contend with some new and unexpected violence. William Hurt turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a mobster and Ed Harris is pretty scary as a determined gangster ready to extract revenge for past misdeeds. What makes \\"Violence\\" so great is Cronenberg's ability to make everything seem so real. We believe Mortensen and Bello are married. They are sexy, happy, love each other, have kids they love, seem content. When the act of violence occurs, and Mortensen's character becomes a hero, he earns unwanted media attention leading to a confrontation with the gangsters. As the danger escalates, and secrets are revealed, we care more and more about Mortensen's and Bello's characters. Is the film violent? Yes, but these scenes play a significant role in the overall story. Amazingly, \\"A History of Violence\\" is based on a graphic novel.<br /><br />Cronenberg and Mortensen apparently liked working  together so well they reteam for \\"Eastern Promises\\".<br /><br />Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife at a hospital in London, treats a young pregnant woman a few nights before Christmas. When the mother dies, the midwife looks through her belongings, trying to find the address of family, to care for the newborn child. All she finds is a diary filled with entries written in Russian and a business card for a restaurant called Trans-Siberian. The next day, she rides her motorcycle to this restaurant and meets the owner, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). He is preparing a large feast for his extended family but can spare a few moments. He listens to Anna's story and is sorry he can't help. Anna thanks him for his time and mentions she will have her uncle translate the girl's diary, to see if they can find an address. Diary? Semyon tells her to bring the diary to him the next day, he will help translate it. As she leaves the restaurant, Anna meets Nikolai (Mortensen) and Kiril (Vincent Cassel). Kiril is the son of Semyon and considers himself the prince of the crime family his father has built. Nikolai is his friend, and a `driver' for the organization. Anna realizes these people are part of the Russian mob, but continues to run into them, ignoring her mother's pleas to stay away. As if the problem of the dead girl is not enough, Semyon must deal with Kiril's murder of a Chechen gangster. How can he protect his son?<br /><br />I read a story about \\"Eastern Promises\\" quoting Cronenberg disputing the film is very violent. His argument was something along the lines of \\"There are only three scenes of violence\\". It's enough, David. It's enough. Cronenberg is a very good director, one of the most consistent working in film today. When he makes a film, he strives to make it as authentic as possible. If the film contains violence, he wants it to be authentic. Those three scenes are graphic, scary and very believable because they are portrayed in such a believable fashion. This is not the only aspect of the film worth mentioning, and the violence is an integral part of the story and these characters lives, but these scenes will linger in your memory for a while, much as they have mine. One scene in particular is so memorable, and something I am sure you have never seen before, that it might just become one of those scenes people keep referring to. It involves Nikolai fighting with some gangsters, in a steam bath, and Nikolai is buck-naked. Yes, Viggo Mortensen is buck-naked. I think I just sold a number of tickets. I want a commission.<br /><br />But Cronenberg doesn't shrink away from showing the consequences of violence. If someone gets slashed with a razor, they bleed. If someone gets punched, you almost feel it in your gut. Anyone who has seen any of Cronenberg's other films realizes this is mild in comparison to some of the things he has showed in his earlier work. But it is no less effective considering his current films deal with more real people and their situations.<br /><br />Cronenberg has really been exploring the relationships of his characters in his last few films, to a greater extent than he used to. Or perhaps his skill has developed to the point where these elements of his films seem to take a more prominent role. In either case, his films seem more human, the characters more vulnerable.<br /><br />One such character is Nikolai, played by Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen's roles in each of Cronenberg's films are similar in one regard; each man has a streak of vulnerability. In \\"A History of Violence\\", it is much more noticeable. In \\"Eastern Promises\\", Nikolai is a tough guy, a `driver' who processes their victims to make sure they are unidentifiable. But there are moments when we become aware of his vulnerability. When he meets Anna, he tries to protect her from what he knows is about to happen. He realizes she is an honest person, a nice person, and doesn't belong in this world.<br /><br />Nikolai's vulnerability is almost always revealed just before or just after an act of violence which helps to show why he is so good at what he does, why he is such a ferocious fighter, determined to win. He has to prove he is a tough guy, to stay in this crowd.<br /><br />As the film continues, we begin to learn little things about Nikolai, making him a more complex character. Nikolai is very interested in becoming a soldier for this `family' and will do just about anything anyone tells him to. This means he has to listen to Kiril and follow his sometimes crazy, out of left field instructions. He also has to do whatever Semyon says, to prove he is a worthy addition to the family. But why is he so interested in joining this family?<br /><br />Naomi Watts does a good job as Anna, the second generation Russian who is completely British. When she initially confronts this problem, she cares for the dead girl. But she goes beyond this, to try to help reunite her orphaned girl with family for more complex reasons. We learn she may have more in common with this girl, giving them a stronger bond, making her efforts more meaningful.<br /><br />Anna lives with her mother (Sinead Cusack) who worries about her daughter's involvement with these people. She knows they are part of the Vory V Zakone brotherhood and her late husband related stories about their notorious deeds. Her brother-in-law, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) is a more recent Russian immigrant and stays with them on a frequent basis. When he first learns of the diary, he takes a look through the pages and becomes horrified at what is described. He wants nothing to do with it. But then his interest gets the better of him. When he realizes whom the young lady was dealing with, he tries to protect Anna, as much as an old man can.<br /><br />Armin Mueller- Stahl (\\"Avalon\\", \\"The Music Box\\", \\"Shine\\") plays Semyon, the head of this organized crime family. His ornate, elaborate restaurant is both a sanctuary and a place to hold court. Filled with rich red velvet, silver place settings, huge paintings and tapestries, it looks like a restaurant that has been around a long, long time. How else could it make any money? But it also looks like a festive place, a place for family celebrations and parties. Semyon is the head of this empire and he reflects all of these images as well. He is the benevolent host, the stern businessman, and the dangerous head of a criminal organization.<br /><br />Mueller - Stahl is very good, perhaps Best Supporting Actor good. Semyon is a man of many faces and Mueller - Stahl is able to portray these in a way making his character both more realistic and more interesting. When he first meets Anna, we realize he is holding back information, trying to see what she has. When he realizes she has the young girl's diary, he triesto get it from her through friendly persuasion. He doesn't want to harm her. But we know he could. He simply wants to protect himself, his family and his `family'. And we recognize that he will do whatever is necessary to do this.<br /><br />Semyon is the head of the organized crime family, but has to play ambassador to the other people in the family. He has to pay heed to what they want and need. But if Semyon wants something done. It gets done. Semyon is an interesting character because Mueller - Stahl is able to make all of the different facets of his character known, yet in a subtle way.<br /><br />And Semyon has to deal with his son, Kiril. Played by Vincent Cassel (\\"Read My Lips\\", \\"Derailed\\"), Kiril is the least successful character. The most dramatic, he is also the most excitable, and can be seen as the most over dramatic. I get it. He is supposed to be immature, impulsive and insecure. But Cassel waves his arms around like a cartoon character. Kiril is over the top, but we also get it, a little, so this makes up for the over-the-top aspect, a little.<br /><br />I have given a number of reasons in support of my claim that Cronenberg is one of the best filmmakers working today. Let me close with one last reason. As we watch \\"Eastern Promises\\", a sly shift in the narrative happens. Actually, there are a few. In the hands of a less accomplished filmmaker, these moments would simply fall apart and make us groan. In \\"Eastern Promises\\", they serve to excite the viewer of the possibilities. Naturally, to talk about either, and they are related, in a way, would spoil them. You shall have to experience them for yourselves.l.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|i have always loved this movie, when I was smaller I would beg my father to rent the VHS from Blockbuster, however someone had rented it and never brought it back.  Eventually in college I had bought the VHS and watched it numours times....    This movie is great and has great characters, I have never read the books by L. Frank Baum, but this movie def drove me to do so.  My favorite part is the gallery of head and the best characters are the comical wheelers
B000001DU5|4.0|\\"Tears for fears\\" are a band with a style of music that I really appreciate and I tend to lump them with the like of Australian acts such as Mondo Rock [just put up a review of one of their albums today] and Alex Lloyd. All these acts have one thing in common-either a few pop/rock masterpieces, or the same, but with some forgotten gems. Tears For Fears falls into that latter category.       Before I bought this album, some months ago, I used to list as my favourite Tears' song \\"Mad world\\". After I bought the album, I was reminded at how absolutely brilliant the song \\"Head over heels\\" was, with its georgeous piano melody, as played by someone with a sledgehammer, and the Beatle-esque and sing-a-long-able chant at the end. \\"Head over heels\\" is my idea of a truly great pop song-right up there with Mondo Rock's \\"Chemistry\\", Alex Lloyd's \\"Green\\" and Coldplay's \\"Clocks\\". It's that good. Reading the lyrics for the song, it is surpising to see how weird and slightly disturbing the lyrics are! Not exactly conventional pop! Just by the by, there is a magnificent scene in the great movie \\"Donnie Darko\\" where \\"Head over heels\\" is used for a sequence in the movie. It's like a video clip, in some ways...but it's a total visual treat. Forgot to mention that the song also has a really cool guitar riff in it too. Might be the same melody as the chant at the end of the song.      \\"Mad world\\" is probably my second favourite track. It is poppy and dreamy. Again, it has very unusual lyrics for a perfect pop song: \\"The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\\".       There was a time when I would have counted \\"Shout\\" as a great track, but over the years, its charms have diminished for me. Perhaps for someone listening to it for the first time, its chanting, stadium frenzy inducing chorus will entrance.       One song whose charm totally eludes me is \\"Everybody wants to rule the world\\". Here in Australia, this is an FM stereo staple. I never listen to this song when it's onthe radio, and I can't understand how a pop masterpiece like \\"Head over heels\\" gets so relatively little airplay here.       I've pretty much mentioned all the stock standard songs that people list when discussing this band. But, like Mondo Rock, you'll sometimes hear on the radio one of their songs that you'd forgotten about and regret not hearing more often. For instance, the delicate pop of \\"Change\\" or the Beatle-esque \\"Sowing the seeds of love\\". These are all very good songs.       It has been quite a few months since I've listened to this album. I do remember finding some of the unknown songs to me listenable, but, I should point out that they haven't really left an impression on me-I just kmnow that I found them 'listenable'.       If, like me, you loved \\"Head over heels\\", you might want to check out other acts which have songs of a similar calibre which I've reviewe here:  Mondo Rock, The Go Gos, and Alex Lloyd. These are truly great songs of the pop genre.

Thats sucked, so just be careful of the vendor you choose.
1400032717|5.0|\\"This will not be a funny book.  I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them,\\" says Christopher Boone, who is writing a mystery novel while investigating the death of his neighbor's dog, Wellington.  Modern day Sherlock Holmes?  Not exactly. Christopher John Francis Boone is an autistic teenager who just happens to know every prime number up to 7,057, all the countries of the world and their capitols; he cannot stand to be touched, and detests the color yellow. He lives in the suburbs of London with his father, and likes to walk up and down his street in the middle of the night because it makes him feel like he is the only person in the world.  But this isn't just a regular mystery novel, for Christopher also learns about life, love, and the importance of family.  English author Mark Haddon tells the tale of a boy who loses his way, finds it again and solves the mystery of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.     Seven minutes after midnight Christopher finds Wellington lying in the middle of his neighbor's, Mrs. Shears', lawn with a garden fork sticking through his middle.  Mrs. Shears accuses Christopher of killing the dog and since he knows he didn't, he begins his own investigation.  However, his father says that he's not allowed to ask Mrs. Shears about who killed her dog, or ask anyone else about who killed Wellington. Christopher's father also demands that Christopher not trespass in other people's gardens, and eventually, \\"to stop this ridiculous, bloody detective game.\\"     A couple of days later, Christopher explains to Mrs. Alexander, the old lady from house number 39, that he thinks that Mr. Shears killed Wellington because he doesn't live with Mrs. Shears anymore.  Besides, Christopher's father always says that Mr. Shears is an evil man. Christopher's father and Mrs. Shears have grown quite close ever since Christopher's mother passed away and Mr. Shears left Mrs. Shears.  Mrs. Shears has helped Mr. Boone around the house, andbeen his constant companion through their difficult times.  When Christopher asks if Mr. Shears killed his mother, Mrs. Alexander lets out a huge secret that Christopher's father has kept from him for two whole years.     Since Christopher has a mental handicap, everyone doubts that he is capable of taking the math A-level in school.  What everyone doesn't know is that Christopher is a mathematical genius. He can do complicated equations as easy as I can tie my shoes.  Throughout the book Christopher's math equations and formulas are followed by pictures and descriptions relating them to his life.  Christopher has proven his mathematical abilities to his teacher, Siobhan, and she arranges for him to take his math A-levels a few weeks after Wellington is killed.  However, Christopher loses concentration on taking the test because of all the major distractions he's facing like Wellington's death and his issues with his father.     Christopher inquires about his life, his dead mother, and other mysteries of adolescence while investigating Wellington's unfortunate fate, make The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time a great book for all readers, young and old.  This book receives an A-plus for me because it's relatable, and even though Christopher and I have almost nothing in common I find myself sympathizing with his situation.  You will love this book enough to read it multiple times because every time you read it you'll find something new, whether it be a new quirk of Christopher's, an eccentric new picture, or a new piece to the puzzle of who killed Wellington.  Get inside Christopher's head to solve the mystery of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.
0316067598|3.0|I by no means know how tough Navy Seals are but I have watched documentaries on the training aspect and in reading what Mr. Luttrell wrote it read just as bad as it looked and I can only assume that it is 10 to 100 times worse.  That being said, I too had my BS meter going throughout the book.  And maybe it was the ghost writer who set the tone that way and it worked for the majority people (hence all the lavish praise for the book) however there are a number of people out there who question the authenticity of the book.  And since he is the \\"Lone Survivor\\" we must take his word for it and I have no reason not to beleive him.  I agree with RVJ that it would have been murder if they are unarmed and not posing a threat and what if they were going through the passes WITH guns, most Afghanistan travelers through the passes probably ARE armed, that's the nature of the environment and the country.  HELLO!  But if they should shoot at him or show aggression then blow them away without hesitation.  He makes a lot of speculation about those goat herders, and spins the story for us to beleive that they notified the Taliban.  We can assume that is the case to make the story fit.  Here's a question for all you \\"kill'em now, sort it out later\\", what if he came upon the same type of people but instead of the \\"bad\\" guys what if he came upon the guys who eventually saved him.  I don't think he would have know the difference between the two.  Both groups held guns, both groups traveled through the mountains, both groups had beards, both groups did not shoot at him nor engage him with aggresssion, and both groups are Afghanis.  But one was good and one was bad.....how are you to know?  A lot of why's also cloud my mind that as a civilian I wouldn't be able to know the answer to but I'll put them out there for you to critique: Why did they wait so long to use their alternate communication?  Both times!  This is a great read and I've enjoyed a lot of it and I am grateful for our armed services for their dedication and bravery.  I am also happy that Mr. Luttrell was able to get back home to this wonderful country and I feel for him and the families for the other fallen soldiers.  It's nice to see that he was able to memorialize them in this heroic book.services for their dedication and bravery.

0684874350|5.0|Imagine being crammed into a one bedroom home with two siblings, an alcoholic father, an exhausted mother, a flooded downstairs, and the constant threat of tuberculosis, or even worse, death knocking at your door. On top of it all, imagine being so poor that going days without food is normal and an egg can be considered a delicacy. No matter how difficult that is to imagine, it was nevertheless the life of young Frank McCourt.      Frankie grows up in the slums of Ireland where begging is commonplace and children must find jobs at the age of 14 in order to support their entire family. Frankie struggles to overcome his destitute life, the death of three siblings, and a father who drinks away all of the money needed in order for the rest of the family to survive. This is the world that you experience as you begin reading Angela's Ashes, a true-life memoir of Frank McCourt.     Angela's Ashes takes place during the Great Depression where poverty runs rampant through the streets and even the most proud of families is reduced to begging in order to get a simple lump of coal. However, Frankie has the seemingly unrealistic dream of eventually travelling to America and starting his life anew. Throughout the course of the novel you are left wondering how Frankie can gain the physical or mental power to accomplish his goal.     One aspect of the novel which I found very intriguing is Frank's use of \\"comic relief\\" in order to keep his otherwise depressing life hopeful and at least somewhat upbeat. Mikey Molloy, a cross-eyed friend of Frank who suffers from \\"fits\\" (seizures), is one such example of this sporadic humor. Frank even recounts one time when Mikey fakes one of his fits in order to sneak into the movie theater. \\"...I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream...That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.\\"  Scenes like this really kept me smiling throughout the sadness in Angela's Ashes.     McCourt's writing style also provides a relieving mixture of both comedy and sorrow. At one point, Frankie contracts typhoid fever and describes his experience with the doctor in charge. \\"It's dark and Dr. Campbell's sitting by my bed...He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.\\" Through the innocence and naivety of Frank's voice, I felt as though I could really understand and feel what the author was feeling while recounting his life.     Despite all of the comedy throughout this novel, the author never loses sight of the main aspect of the story: the sorrow. Frank basically has to support his entire family by himself at a very young age because his dad is always at the bar drinking away every penny he earns. From the age of three to nineteen, Frankie moves from one house to the next, and each time the conditions get worse and worse to the point where Frank and his family have to live next to an outhouse which is shared by the entire street they live on. Not only that, but Frank's mother, Angela, has to spend all day scrounging the streets for whatever scraps she can find to help her family survive.      Angela's Ashes has become one of my favorite books. Although I would suggest it to a more mature audience due to some of its scenes, I would still recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Frank McCourt's struggle growing up in Ireland. I would easily give this book an \\"A.\\" I never lost interest in the plot no matter how depressing it was and the characters always kept me compelled to learn more about their plight and hardship. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and most importantly this book will make you appreciate what you have and realize that we have it pretty good here in America.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|The Plot,    Fast Cars, Hot babes and good dialogue is what is in this movie. Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russel) drives a car called / entitled Death Proof, it proves the driver with a almost safe guard againist any accident the driver get himself into. The movie is a play on the old school Grindhouse cinema style so you will notice that the film does jump or is chopped at parts why, back in the day Grindhouse movies were made for almost nothing and had no real big productions behind them so often they did have jumps and bad editing. The Movie is Set in Austin, Texas and trys to make you feel like back in the day, you will notice a old 45 record player at the Bar, this trust me is a Classic and is hard to find them now of days, I mean 45 the record player ask your parents kids what a 45 is if they don't know ask your grandparents then.    The movie goes through a lot of trouble to make you feel like back in the day, old movie posters and classic signs are littered throughout the movie look for them its a great touch to the movie. The movie starts out following Three hot babes going to a bar, and talking and just having fun so far, later on Butterfly(Vanessa Ferlito) notices a certain car following them, its in fact is a Jet black 1970 Chevry Nova supercharged, driven by Stuntman Mike. As the girls at the bar are drinking and enjoying themself's one patron asks for a ride, Pam(Rose McGowan) has been chosen by Stuntman Mike, he offers her a ride home when he is ready, meanwhile the back story here is that Jungle Julia(Sydney Tamiia Poitier) runs a radio show in Austin and has said that for anyone who asks Butterfly her name and offers her beer and says a certain line she would give them a lap dance. Well guess who takes up that offer, Stuntman Mike does and after he does a old John Wayne line he gets a lap dance from Butterfly. After the seductive lap dance they all start to depart the bar, now the fun starts for the film.    Remember Pam is riding with Stuntman Mike, and after he goes over why he calls his car Death Proof she decides to go along with it. But soon learns she made a real bad choice, as Stuntman Mike starts to scare the living hell out of her, and finally he kills her, and now he goes after the other girls from the bar and after finding them on a lone stretch of road, he turns his Chevy Nova around and rams them with the lights out, for a touch of Class he turns them on just before hitting them, you will love the car crash and the mulitangles its shot in, great cinema on this crash truely.    Well after that, Stuntman Mike is in the Hospital recovering from the crash, he is the only survivor of the crash. Well after a short stay at the Hospital he can now be found in Tennessee, now you will meet up with Abernathy(Rosario Dawson), Kim(Tracie Thoms), Lee(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Zoe(Zoe Bell). First off both Kim and Zoe are gearheads / stuntwomen so they know there way around a car. Well Zoe says why she wanted to come to Tennessee is to find a 1969 Dodge Charger with a 440 under the hood and it happens to be that there is someone one with a stack one and is up for Sale. Now the Girls just want to drive it to recreate a scene from Vanishing Point. So after Abernathy, Kim and Zoe talk it over they decide to leave Lee with the owner, hoping that her charm will keep the owner distracted. So after they start off on their recreation scene soon Stuntman Mike who has been stalking them so far, starts to begin ramming it, big thing to remember is that Zoe is basically hanging on the hood of the car, so as you can tell Zoe is hanging on to the hood of the car as Stuntman Mike is ramming and banging the car. Well after a couple of minutes Zoe is thrown from the car's hood and into a bush, and after that Stuntman Mike gets out of his car to congratulate himself but Kim shots him in the arm, so he leaves but Zoe is ok so the girls decide to take it to Stuntman Mike at his own game.    From there you can imagine the next car chasescenes is one of a kind, with both the girls and stuntman mike not giving a inch, well from there you have to see the movie to see what happens next, I can't give away the ending just like that its a good movie so check it out for yourself.    The only problem I got is the fact that these movies both Planet Terror and Death Proof where billed as a double feature meaning a two for one, and now I have to buy each one sperately is totally crap to me and everyone else.
0316191299|5.0|\\"This afternoon I sat in the eighth-floor SantaLand office and was told, ` Congratulations, Mr. Sedaris.  You are an elf.'\\"  This is one of the many hilarious quotes from David Sedaris' novel Holidays on Ice which contains six enlightening Christmas stories.  Also known for his other hilarious books Me Talk Pretty One Day and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, middle aged humorist Sedaris writes about his own experiences and thoughts on the Christmas season.     In the first essay entitled \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" Sedaris tells his about his crazy encounters working as an elf in the department store Macy's after getting rejected from UPS.  He describes the shoppers and fellow employees with sarcastic humor.  He tells about his various jobs that he works, and explains about the Magic Window position.  He has to stand there and exclaim, \\"Step on the Magic Star and look through the window, and you can see Santa!\\"  One day he gets bored of saying the same fifteen words over and over again, so he decides to mix things up a bit. \\"Step on the Magic Star and you can see Cher and Mike Tyson!\\"  People start to get upset when they sacrifice their spot in line to see Santa to go into the Magic Star line.  Needless to say, David Sedaris is never positioned in the Magic Star line again.       The next essay, \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" is a fictional story about the ridiculousness of long family descriptions on Christmas cards.   \\"He's made the honor roll every semester and there seems to be no stopping him!!!  A year and a half left to go and already the job offers are pouring in!  We love you, Kevin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" exclaims the narrator Mrs. Dunbar.  Mrs. Dunbar's ideal world, however, soon comes crashing down when a stranger named Khe Sahn suddenly comes to live with them.  As it turns out, Mrs. Dunbar's \\"perfect\\" husband had a daughter in Vietnam named Khe Sahn.  As the story unfolds, Khe Sahn turns their world upside down.       \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" is another essay describing the bizarre world of David Sedaris.  He tells how his sister Lisa brought her friend Dinah home one day four days before Christmas.  He describes the humorous way in which his family reacts to her, and the questions they ask her about her interesting life in prison and about her experiences as a prostitute.     Another essay, \\"Christmas Means Giving,\\" tells the fictional story about one family's competition with their neighbors, the Cottinghams.  Every year, the neighbors try to out-do the other's Christmas deeds, and as you will see it gets pretty crazy as the families try to be the best and most \\"giving\\" in the neighborhood.     Holidays on Ice is a hilarious book of essays that will keep you laughing non-stop.  I recommend this novel for anyone who wants a good laugh, young or old.  I personally give this book two very enthusiastic thumbs up for its dry humor.  Each sarcastic and humorous essay will make you want to read the next.   By the way, this collection of essays would make a great Christmas gift!
1594200823|5.0|This is the sort of book that it is impossible to read and not fundamentally reassess the way you eat.  Millions of Americans don't give a second thought to where their food comes from beyond the supermarket or McDonald's.  This book explores that issue and returns with a searing indictment of the industrial food complex, one which I no longer feel comfortable participating in if I am to keep my conscience clean.  If we are going to continue to eat as we do, we much at least face up to exactly what it is we are doing to the environment, the animals, and especially to ourselves.  I implore any and everyone to read this book and think about how what you eat fits into your ethical worldview.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Guys ... Stop analyzing and enjoy the music !    How does inconsequential analysis matter ? ... limited vocal range, soft folk music .... Why ? I ask...    It's a beautiful, simple set of songs by an artist at the top of his game...If you are looking for rocking songs like \\"Money for nothing\\", \\"Sultans of Swing\\" ... you are looking at the wrong place. This album is like perfectly aged vintage bordeaux wine ... not a tequila shot. Everything has a time and place ... This is the time for \\"Kill to get Crimson\\" ... Enjoy it while it lasts  !    As Mark very eloquently put it in this album .... \\"let it all go\\"    ... Stop analyzing and enjoy the music !

0743201140|5.0|I read this book and took a class on it, there are coaches that are trained all over the world that will help you discover and use your strengths in every day life.  Loved this book. They even have a book for every age, (young students, adults, and college age)
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I love this stuff.. it's full of strong bass, hard percussion and creative melodies/harmonies. To me, this album represents Nikki Sixx's musical talent in the best way since Motley Crue. I think it's obvious that Nikki Sixx and his co-creators dug deep into their artistry to record this album. Even if it didn't coincide with the book, it carries its own weight and pulls together a complete sound & story.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|In \\"Shooter\\", Mark Wahlberg plays a Marine sniper who gets left behind with his spotter for both of them to die on a secret mission in Ethiopia. His friend is killed but Wahlberg makes it out. Disillusioned, he leaves the service to live a hermetic lifestyle in the mountains. A few years later, Danny Glover comes calling asking him to serve his country one more time. They know an attempt will be made on the President's life but not where. They ask Wahlberg to scout the cities the president will be in making speeches, and determine which one would be the logical place the killer would do it. After he gives them the location, an attempt is made but Wahlberg is blamed. The rest of the film is him on the run and trying to unravel what happened. It leads him to a conspiracy involving a high ranking member of congress.    A lot of unbelievable things happen in Shooter but they're done in a stylish way. The plot is an intriguing one even if you do see a few events coming from a mile away. The action is sharp and fast paced with a lot of good performances. Shooter is a step below the Bourne films as government conspiracy action movies go, but it's an enjoyable couple of hours.
0743486285|4.0|I bought the book and finished it in 2 days. Throughout the 80's, I idolized this man and his music, band, image, etc. but I was clueless who this person actually was. This book reveals so much that longtime Motley Crue fans probably didn't understand. I think you have to be interested in what this man has to say to like his book. It's a roller coaster journey and it's often mentally draining. After you read this book, which mainly represents one year in his life, you may feel like you need to sleep for a week (and you'll surely stock up on toilet paper). I think Nikki Sixx is creatively brilliant and artistically gifted but above all, he's destined to be alive and share his story (aka one lucky s.o.b.). I was engrossed as I read and I rooted for him as though he really was a HERO drowning in heroin. I found myself empathizing with his struggle and thanking the powers that be for my own drug free life. This is not a story to enjoy like a summer romance, but it's a story to be awakened by. It opens your eyes, sickens your stomach then makes you laugh. And I surely will forever remain a fan.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|anybody who can't appreciate this album doesn't like music......i'm sure they would rather hear some violence and killing, and since Kanye doesn't do that, he doesn't appeal to some people......so sad......this album is the hottest thing in 07 by far......
0439813786|5.0|As a children's librarian, I rate this book as one of the best!  I think it has a chance to win both the Newbery and Caldecott Medals.
0061122416|1.0|At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, why has this book gone as far as it has?  I consider myself a fairly spiritual person and I resented being lectured to--heck, beaten over the head with the Soul of the World.  Perhaps this is a by-product of our secular existence, this grasping for anything, no matter how badly written.  Jonathan Livingston Seagull and The Celestine Prophecy come to mind.  The Alchemist is frustrating to readers who like a good story with their platitudes.  One would do better to go back to the original Arabian Nights.  There's also more to be learned there.  One star for intent.
B00005JPLW|4.0|You might see the other customer pictures uploaded here..showing the movies they recieved with a small helmet or a immortal mask...but the true picture is the one that just shows the two DVDs. I recieved nothing 'fancy' with my special edition. The movie is great and I recieved the product on time and in shape, but like I said...just expect the movie..nothing else.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye delivers a knockout blow with this one- not just because of songs like \\"Stronger\\" which in my opinion already played itself out. But some of the songs which havent hit the waves yet are so dam good. \\"Good Life\\" is a joyous celebration of life and makes you want to get out your seat and dance; \\"Cant Tell Me Nothing\\"- is the off-radio hit with a great undertoned sound and theme. True, Kanye lacks a bit in the rhyming department. But he more than makes up for it in his production. What Kanye does so well is bring back some old school sounds and hooks and re-samples them, re-incorporates them and re-vitalizes them with his own rhymes- which at times get very very good. \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" makes me laugh- sign of the times. Kanye is speaking in the present on this one- presenting the world as he sees it. Its easy to connect to the lyrics. \\"Flashing Lights\\" will be the next club anthem and is just an obvious hit with a memorable catchy strum of chords. \\"The Glory\\" is a materialistic song that some how, some way, becomes real. \\"Everything I am\\" addresses failing to live up to the world's standards. And \\"Big Bro\\" seems to be about feuding with someone - I think Jay z. \\"Homecoming\\" has a great tune and for some odd reason: has a dude from Coldplay. This, like some others, sounds something out of the 70s or 80s. I love it!     The album should redefine hip hop. It's as close as it gets to being a perfect commercial hip hop album in my opinion- mostly because the songs make you feel so good about life. West definitely delivers a glamorous album that is sure to surpass anything 50 cent puts out.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Fast shipping, great price. If you have a HD DVD player get The Planet Earth and you will not be desapointed.
B000VZUWZW|1.0|What is the equivalent of blackface for geeks?  Whatever it is, from social anxiety to plaid plants, it's here in spades.  Add on to that that the writers misuse of technical terms to create a patter of supposed geeky \\"repartee\\", and it's clear that they are simply making fun of geeks rather than celebrating them.  There's no reason for any geek to watch this other than to see himself being made fun of.  And poorly at that.  On the other hand, I did actually laugh three times through the episode (I forget at what now), so it does fare marginally better than most sitcoms, though those three funny moments were atypical of the quality of the show, not merely crossing the threshold.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Graceland is a brilliant piece of music; I once had it on cassette only but replaced it with the purchase of the CD.  Sounds even better and I will always love it !!
0345494997|4.0|I fell in love with Loving Frank as soon as I started reading it.   Everything comes alive in this book, the Oak Park neighborhood, streets of Berlin, sweet pain of parenthood, and a crazy, passionate love affair.  Mamah Cheney's character is exciting, intelligent and compassionate, and it really is her who has a larger presence.  It makes me sad to think about all the unrealized potential she had, and glad in the same time that Ms. Horan gave her a voice.  The book also made me interested in the work of FLW.  Their relationship was definitely  one of a great physical and emotional connection which is relatively rare in the world.  I am giving it four stars because some parts were little slow.  A terrific read though, don't miss it.
0743486285|5.0|I read a few reviews and I was a little put off by what I've read and say that I don't agree with some of the posted reviewers. I bought the book on Tues and I'm halfway through it and can't seem to put it down.  I look forward to reading this book any chance I can get.  Although I have never had any substance abuse problems in my life so far, I can relate to the childhood pains that Nikki speaks of.  I don't believe that Nikki is playing the victim or trying to come off as a victim to readers; he is only pointing out the importance of how childhood hurts can rear its ugly head at times when your are experiencing new hurt and if we don't deal with our past hurts in a professional manner (seeking help, guidance, counseling, etc.) it can come up as rage and/or self destructive behavior.  Yes, we can push it out of our minds and forgot about things for months, years; yet when past painful memories surface in combination w/ current hurts you now have as he points out a \\"accumulative\\" effect which is anger, rage, hurt, pain, and self-destructive behaviors as he writes about in his \\"Heroin Diaries\\".  So far Nikki I understand ya.    I think he should come out with a new book about how the record industry is as he and is \\"nemesis\\" put it \\"slavery.\\"  Remember when Prince would perform his concerts with the word \\"SLAVE\\" written on his cheek?  Strange how Prince's name to me is now associated with Nikki.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Wow, what a ride Mr. West has had since his near classic \\"The College Dropout\\", an album that to this day remains one of my favorite hip hop albums of all time. His sophomore release \\"Late Registration\\" was no slouch either. Lets not forget all of the albums he has produced and appeared on either in production or rhyming. Yes, Kanye has truly made his mark upon hip hop, for better or worse.     \\"The Graduation\\" is Kanye West's latest offering, a sort of culmination of his last two albums, following the college theme. Following in his traditional beat making scheme, nearly every song is comprised of samples from other songs; a Kanye West staple. His beats and production as always, are top notch. Tracks like \\"I wonder\\",\\"Homecoming\\", \\"Good Morning\\", \\"The Good Life\\", \\"Flashing Lights\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Champion\\" and \\"Can't tell me nothing\\" feature the best beats on the album, most notably \\"Flashing lights\\" which has a sort of House vibe to it. And most of these are either radio hits already or will be soon to come. Sadly not all of the beats on the album are this tight, and some are rather forgettable. Tracks like \\"Drunk and Hot girls\\" and \\"Everything I am\\" are truly boring and very skippable.     There are a few guest star on \\"The Graduation\\", most notably T-Pain (on the banger \\"The good life\\", Chris Martin of Coldplay fame (on Homecoming, a rather good track), Lil Wayne (on Barry Bonds, a rather bland track) Mos Def (on the very annoying and pointless \\"Drunk and Hot girls\\") and Dwele (on one of the best songs on the album, \\"Flashing lights\\").    Kanye's lyrics follow his usual banter; a slow relaxed flow that is brutally honest, simplistic and heartfelt. I have never looked at Kanye as being a particularly tight emcee; he is a much better producer but he does have some skills on the microphone. The only problem is that his lyrical content never deviates from the same topic, which usually revolves around how happy he is that he \\"made it\\" or how many objects he can purchase. While this is nice for the radio, it really doesn't leave any room for creativity or ingenuity, and his lyrics become boring and bland rather quickly.    I got this album the day it came out and listened to it every day for about two weeks. I thought it was the hottest thing. But then I noticed that I stopped listening to it all together and the album now gathers dust on my shelf. Did I listen to it way too much or is \\"The Graduation\\" just another \\"throwaway\\" release that won't be listened to next year? We have all seen where mainstream hip hop is headed. Every new track, and hot new joint that comes out is heavily hyped up and played on the radio and car stereos for about a month, then it is quickly forgotten and something new and, in most cases exactly the same, comes out to take its place.     I don't think \\"The Graduation\\" has staying power, it is not a hip hop classic by any means. Kanye, for the most part doesn't deviate from his tried and true form. While there is nothing wrong with this it doesn't break any new ground and is more or less \\"more of the same\\" that we have heard for the last two years.     Don't get me wrong, \\"The Graduation\\" is a good listen and is very enjoyable, but it may quickly find its way onto your \\"forgotten\\" shelf. And this is the inevitable fate of all \\"pop rap\\"...
B00005JPRF|5.0|Alice (Milla Jovovich) may have survived the downfall of Raccoon City, but victory was bittersweet as the rest of the world collapsed due to the T-Virus. Now roaming the Earth alone, unaware that she's being under surveillance by Umbrella chief Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) and Dr. Sam Isaacs (Iain Glen), she eventually runs into a convoy in Utah lead by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), as well as survivors Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr), L.J. (Mike Epps), Nurse Betty (Ashanti), K-Mart (Spencer Locke), and Mikey (Chris Egan). With some hope left, the team plans a route to Las Vegas to obtain fuel and over to Alaska, the only place where the T-Virus hasn't plagued. Of course, Wesker and Isaacs may have some other plans.    Along with a small number of others, I myself was a fan of the original \\"Resident Evil\\" film back in '02. Paul W.S. Anderson might've striken fear, because after all, he didn't do so well with the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" films. Yet, even after the backlash, he found his niche when he directed the adaptation of the classic survival horror franchise. It might not have been high art, but Anderson treated the material seriously, creating characters worth giving a damn about (unlike other horror garbage), unleashing a breakthrough performance by Milla Jovovich (too bad she had to follow it up with \\"Ultraviolet\\"), and successfully mixing spine-tingling chills and well-staged action.    Anderson turned down directing part 2, \\"Apocalypse\\", and let Alexander Witt direct. A second unit director of various films, Witt used references of the games - including familiar characters (Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliveira, Nemesis) and scenes (Alice running across the hall doding bullets from an airplane was lifted from \\"Code: Veronica\\") - which may have been fine, but it lacked the fun and panache that Anderson may have brought. Still, Milla Jovovich brought her A-game, and that was good enough, right?    Now it's 2007, and Russell Mulcahy (\\"Highlander\\") is now next to give RE fans another jolt. \\"Extinction\\" features a bigger cast of familiar faces (including a \\"Heroes\\" regular, another successful singer-turned actress, and Mike Epps making a return), more characters from the game (including Albert Wesker and Claire Redfield), and even more scares and suspense than what the series ever produced. It's not an art film, but then again, I'm not into Oscar-nominated crap (::cough:: \\"Lions for Lambs\\" ::cough::).    Right off the bat, Mulcahy sets the mood for well-timed scares and jolts that genuinely work instead of just being put there. \\"Resident Evil\\" films are known for being action-oriented and full of fight scenes were Alice wields whatever she gets her hand on (it's recommended for those scenes alone). Yet Mulachy shows full respect for the horror portion and delivers quality suspense (the first act of the film gets major browny points) instead of giving into the bottom-of-the-barrel rule of piling on gore for the sake of gore.    And when it gets to the action, hold on to your hats. I will stress this: Milla Jovovich, provided if she DID perform all of these stunts, delivers on all cyllinders. Whether it's using twin blades to cut up zombies or evading the viscious zombie dogs, Jovovich does an amazing job with whatever stunts she's called to do. And she hardly breaks a sweat when she's called to act. Call me a geek, but if there's someone in Hollywood looking for an actress to appear as one of the female fighters in an adaptation of \\"Street Fighter\\" or \\"Tekken\\", here's one of your choices.    The supporting cast also fares well, including Ali Larter and Oded Fehr, who both don't need to out-brood Jovovich. Even with the small screen time given, urban actors Ashanti and Mike Epps provide some much needed humor in the dreaded atmosphere, though I wish they weren't killed off. Spencer Locke (aka Jenny from \\"Monster House\\") also leaves a good mark on the film, and I hope it won't be the last (though the powers that be may wind up putting her in acrap horror film). Finally, Mulcahy did a good thing and brought back Madeline Carroll (the Red Queen from the first \\"Resident Evil\\"), who definitely pulls the creepy girl role off with no sweat.    To top it all off, the finale promises a sequel to come around. It's not new, since all these films offered the same batch of snacks for everyone. Still, it's a sigh of relief that there's someone out there that has some respect of a classic game franchise (like Corey Yeun, and unlike Uwe Boll) and use that to make a great film out of. It's mindless fun that movies need these days. But, hey, I'm just a guy looking for that kind of jolt.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Great movie. Make sure you're not watching it on an HD upconvert DVD player though, cause it won't work.

B0002WYS6S|4.0|This DVD not only sounds great, but it's beautifully shot at the same time!  I never really expected to find a concert DVD that actually seemed to have some artistic thought behind it, but this one does.    As for the content, well, it can be a bit of a turn-off if you don't really enjoy the \\"second half\\" of Dream Theater's career (which started with \\"Scenes From a Memory\\").  Otherwise it's a pretty good introduction for those who'd like a taste of what the band is capable of.  Everything is played flawlessly, of course, but James LaBrie fails to clock in a consistent performance, and actually going painfully flat on a couple of numbers from \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\"  A couple of shining moments for the band include the performances of \\"Hollow Years\\" and the \\"Instrumedly,\\" and while Jame's singing isn't top notch on it, the rare treat of \\"Only a Matter of Time\\" off of \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" is given an updated, and perhaps even more bombastic form than the original.      Overall, it's a great DVD that has a pretty dang good concert.  If you're looking for something that has a better overview of the band's work, then check out the \\"Score\\" DVD that they recently put out (And James puts in a legendary performance on it that was missing from Budokan).  Otherwise, enjoy a nice overview of their more recent work and try to ignore James singing out of key (he's still one of my favorite singers...)
B000002UTY|2.0|Great performance,<br /><br />but the sound is a POOR IMITATION of the real thing, compressed and the frequency response is midrangy and really limited. Spend a few bucks more and get the IMPORT version (not the Japanese one). The IMPORT sound is a REVELATION, three octaves wider, hi-fi demo quality on a good stereo, despite being over 40 years old. Just spectacular sound, unbelievably well recorded bass lines.<br /><br />This pressing has criminally bad remastering by Capital, who doubtless has the master tapes.<br /><br />If you haven't heard the IMPORT, you've NEVER heard this CD!<br />The one you want is: &lt;ASIN: B00004TKAQ> not this version.<br />The \\"EROC at the Ranch\\" remix.
B000CNESU8|5.0|News anchor Howard Beale's ratings are down, so he has to go.  Only Howard won't go quietly.    He gets mad (as hell) and takes the opportunity of what he believes to be his last show to talk to America and do something rarely seen in the news industry: speak the truth.  The truth free from all the filters, limitations, codes, norms and standards placed on the industry.  Howard goes on air and opens his heart to his audience in what amounts to part confessional and part manifesto.  In that night, a hero is born.    Sydney Lumet's Network follows the ripple effects of Howard's declaration, as he becomes the mad prophet of the airwaves, featured in every newspaper and magazine in the country and pedestalized as the new poster child for the fledgling UBS network.  The results are remarkably apropos for today's era of O'Reilly/Olbermann entertainment shows masquerading as news programs, where cable companies bow to the gods of ratings over journalistic principles.           Beale's show becomes the one place on television where viewers can expect honesty, and Howard becomes the voice of a generation jaded by Watergate and Vietnam.  But Howard's pure and honest intentions tether themselves to the greed and opportunism of his network, with executives uninterested in what Howard says as much as they are that he is popular.  Once his ratings drop, they'll be ready to let him go in favor of the next moneymaker.    At over two hours, Network is a bit blotted.  A second story about a primetime drama based on a militant liberal underground organization plays well alongside the Howard Beale story and helps to raise questions about the lengths networks will go for ratings.  However, a romance subplot seems out of place and slows the story down at times.
B000VZBCWE|3.0|\\"Queen Rock Montreal\\" might seem like a new live DVD from Queen to those who are unaware but in reality, this is actually the THIRD DVD release of the Montreal show which has previously been released under the title \\"We Will Rock You.\\" One assumes that since Queen now own the rights to the concert film, they wanted to change the title so as not to confuse people with their musical of the same name.  While there are some new bonus features on this disc as compared with previous versions (the new edition features a commentary with band members Brian May and Roger Taylor) the primary reason is that Brian May was not happy with the DTS surround sound mixes included on the previous versions and the new disc offers an \\"approved\\" surround sound mix. Not much of a selling point if you ask me.  No word on if \\"Rock Montreal\\" will be presented in widescreen like the last DVD was (this *was* a concert film intended for theaters.)  This particular edition of the DVD includes a bonus disc featuring Queen's historic set at Live Aid which, you guessed it, has also been previously released on DVD. Lots of double and triple dipping here and frankly the inclusion of their Live Aid segment is a tad shameful, using their set from a charity show to promote their own product makes me cringe a bit.  On top of all this, the \\"Rock Montreal\\" concert is virtually identical to the set list from Queen's last DVD, \\"On Fire at the Bowl.\\" There just isn't much here for fans to buy yet again. HOWEVER the companion CD release of the concert (which uses the same title) has never been officially released on CD before AND it includes two songs NOT included on the DVD so that's certainly something for a fan to buy.  Overall, \\"Queen Rock Montreal\\" is not a must buy for Queen fans unless you have not purchased the concert before.

0307277887|4.0|This sequel to Dearly Devoted Dexter has the witty voice of Dexter, but the plot is not as riveting as the first book.  Still, it's a wonderful read.
0385040253|4.0|This is an excellent book for flipping through.  It is well illustrated, and the descriptions of the knots are full of great information.  I have encountered a few knots that I couldn't tie based on the words and pictures, but the vast majority of them are clear and can be mastered with a few minutes' effort.     My only real complaint is that, with the book alone, it is difficult to look up a particular knot by name.  However, since the Ashley Book of Knots is the standard reference, Google is extremely well suited to overcoming this limitation.  For example, the index doesn't mention Monkey's Fist,  so I googled \\"monkey's fist ABOK\\" and didn't even have click any links before I found the correct number (2200).      All told, this is a great book and I'd recommend it highly.
B00005JNQA|4.0|I saw this movie at the end of its run in the movie theaters. My husband & son were not interested but I was intrigued by the reviews I had read so I went by myself. I do not care for gratuitous violence in movies. A really good movie, in the opinion of the men in my life, must have a violent death in the first 60 seconds and 25-30 violent scenes total -- car crashes, murders, blown up buildings, fight scenes. There is violence in this movie but it is not gratuitous and I found the movie much less violent than I expected. An explosion and murders occur but they are the type of violence that would happen if this film was relating a real life African political intrigue. The African political situation at the core of this movie is plausible which is more than can be said about the plots of many other movies. I thought the screen play for this movie was both well written and true to life. (I don't mean to imply implausible is the necessarily the same as bad-- some of the best movies ever are completely implausible.)<br /><br />Nicole Kidman's character, a UN interpreter who is expert in African dialects, returns to her booth to pick up an item left behind. The UN floor appears to be empty but she inadvertently overhears a conversation about a planned assassination of the current leader of an African nation , a man who is due to make an appearance at the UN. The African nation is the one in which her family lived; she grew up there. She reports the overheard conversation to the FBI. The FBI, especially a grieving agent played by Sean Penn, does not believe her. They investigate her and find in her past life in Africa many reasons to doubt her story. However, they must investigate the planned assassination anyway even if they think it is bogus. It soon becomes clear as unexpected (some violent) events begin to take place surrounding the interpreter that something is going on although the FBI agent played by Sean Penn is unsure whether it is a real African based assassination plot or the interpreter reported the conversation to throw off suspicion from herself for something she is planning. At the same time, he finds himself drawn to her, the first woman who has interested him since the death of his wife. Nicole Kidman brings to her role the sort of class and reserve one would imagine a UN interpreter to possess. I found Sean Penn's tortured FBI agent portrayal sympathetic and very Sean Penn-ish. (I must admit I do not believe FBI agents are really so dishevelled looking. Perhaps I am just assuming as truth that FBI agents are \\"men in black.\\")<br /><br />I enjoyed all of the plot twists (there ARE many) in this story, the unfolding of the mystery behind the overheard conversation, how it relates to the interpreter's past, the rise and fall of leaders in the African nation. This story was more layered than most thrillers (I have seen them; one can't help it with the men in my life). I would not call it a thriller at all, but a political mystery. It's a very good mystery movie and an unusual one. The movie is set in New York City and partially in Africa. The movie addresses political corruption and legal ethics (which crimes might be justifiable, which crimes should be punished). The UN scenes are fascinating to someone (like me) with an interest in world politics. If you have such an interest too, you may enjoy this movie as I did.<br /><br />BTW on nit-picking reviews: I have noticed some negative reviewers who have nit-picked the movie to justify their thumbs down for it (one review: chess board mistake, \\"booger\\" sighting). My husband, too, likes to pick out nits in the movies he did not like. Recently, I have been drawing his attention to the nits in the movies he loves: a little reminder that there are unbelievable situations and errors in his favorite movies too. His attitude is \\"so what?\\" I guess we honestly do not mind nits in the movies we like and they loom large and overwhelming in the movies we hate. And then there are themovies that are so bad, no one likes them! Still I would like to see negative reviews that explain more fully why the reviewer did not like the movie. It would be more helpful to amazon customers., no one likes them! Still I would like to see negative reviews that explain more fully why the reviewer did not like the movie.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|Knopfler's previous solo albums featured a heavy dose of American folk and country.  This one has hardly a trace of that.  It seems to be an album of British folk music. There's no rock here either.  Too bad.  Come on Mark!  Now and then, crank up that stratocaster and make it snarl and bite! If he gets any more understated, his next album will be a blank CD.       The album consists of Knopfler on guitars and old buddies on keyboards, bass, and drums and with horns, fiddle, and accordian backing them up on some pieces.  Knopfler plays all the guitars and through the wonder of overdubbing -- if that's what it is called -- on some songs he plays acoustic rhythm and electric lead.  Or maybe he's good enough to make one guitar sound like two.  The songs are good; the words are good; but what makes the CD worth 5 stars are those beautiful snatches and swaths of Knopfler playing guitar.  The sound he gets is different and unique on every song.      Smallchief
0385522401|4.0|As always, Ian McEwan's writing is amazing and this book is worth reading just for that.  The story is thought-provoking and frustrating.  Here are two people who have spent time together and build what you think is a relationship.  They waited so long for one moment in time only to simply walk away when the moment is not as they both had hoped.  You cannot believe that they would throw it all away without either party putting up any sort of fight.  Maybe that is suppose to show us that they are truly not in love?        I have read several of his books now and Atonement remains my favorite but this is worth a rainy afternoon of reading.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Hugh Nikki Sixx Fan! Waited a long time to get a hold of this album. I would recommend it to everyone I know. If your getting the book, you have to have this album to go along with it. It makes the story that much better!
B000VZUWZW|4.0|The show isn't perfect - pilots are usually rather awkward - but I thought the writing was pretty good (a number of the geek sterotypes were right-on) and the 2 lead guys did a great job. I had several laugh out loud moments. The girl needs to be less dumb, and I didn't care for the 2 accessory geek friends. But, I think this show has potential.
B0001I562I|2.0|I bought this DVD, remembering how much I liked it back in the day.  Sadly, this is one of those movies that simply does not stand the test of time.  Maybe it's hearing Pee Wee Herman's voice again, post porn-theater, maybe it's Parker's pre-rhinoplasty nose, maybe it's the incredibly weak plot and terrible acting.  Not to mention a sub-standard transfer to boot - I realize not everything is deserving of a Lucasfilm-style cleanup and remaster, but it looks like they just copied this directly from an old Blockbuster VHS tape.<br /><br />It's not without it's positives, however.  It's a \\"wholesome\\" family-friendly movie.  There are no political agendas being pushed, nor is it rife with sexual innuendo like so many so-called kids movies today (Happy Feet, I'm lookin' at you...).  So on that front, it's definitely worthwhile, if you're like me and saddened at the lack of truly family-oriented movies these days.<br /><br />Apparently mine is a minority opinion, seeing how the ratings are 4s and 5s across the board, but I sold this after one viewing - it was enough to make me realize that some things are best left to nostalgic memories.
0740748475|5.0|I bought this boxed set of \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes\\" for my husband's birthday.  He is thrilled with them and we are having a hard time keeping the boys \\"paws\\" off the books!  I ordered them from the UK and they arrived so quickly, I was amazed. Thank you Amazon!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I listen to the music from this CD everyday and never does it get boring. I love it. Some other songs on her other CDs, such as \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Don't Miss You At All\\" are wonderful. These songs are always in my playlist on ITunes. So sexy. It's almost like she fell out of love and now she's just selling out to make money. I hope she doesn't go off the deep end. I pray Norah gets back to your roots. I'm looking for growth, but your new CDs are nothing like this masterpiece. Sheena Easton was RUINED by Prince. Other artists have been messed up by record companies. Jewel was one. I think she's gotten back to what she LOVES. I don't hear LOVE in Norah's voice anymore.
B00005JNS0|4.0|This was a really great movie the whole family could watch!  So refreshing for a change.
B000002IO8|5.0|FYI: As great as the music is on the first disc, I feel it is somewhat hurt by the extreme \\"in your face\\" audience applause before, after, and someimtes during each track.  While MJG of course deserves the applause, it makes the listening experience a tad irritating.  This problem is much less pronounced on disc 2, where the applause is nicely reigned in.  Also, CD two has many more long jams and (in my opinion) the bass is recorded much better on the second CD.  So my suggestion is, buy this double CD set and replace the first CD with another MJQ CD of your choice...DJANGO is the CD I used.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|A very good listen. I enjoyed \\"Funeral\\" more, but this one is very good as well. It's hard to describe what their music style is, bouncy and fun? ecclectic? just different. This is a great group, and I hope they're around for a long time.
0393061310|2.0|Actually I give it 2 1/2 stars.    I first read, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\". Diamond referred occasionally this book. It caught my interest, so I read it too.    I enjoyed reading both books.    One of my favorite quotes, \\"Eurasia's considerable initial advantage thereby was translated into a huge lead as of A.D. 1492--for reasons of Eurasia's distinctive geography rather than of distinctive human intellect. The New Guineas whom I know include potential Edisons.\\"    In his book \\"Collapse: ...\\" Diamond repeatedly states that he doesn't believe in environmental determinism.  I am sure some intellectual will point out to me how this is not a contraction.    Diamond is a smart guy, well traveled, well read. I was a bit disappointed that he chose to use \\"British moths\\" as an example of natural selection. This study has been debunked by many subsequent scientific studies both in Europe and here in the US. Why he chose this as an example of natural selection vs. something scientifically credible is curious.    Overall I enjoyed reading Diamonds point of view in both books. They were worth reading. I look forward to future scientific investigation that will shed additional light on the nature of civilizations.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|I saw a brief blurb about this on Gamespot and decided to check it out. This was only a few bucks more than the blu-ray version and has way more stuff so I picked it up instead.   It comes with great collector items like an \\"Art of Troy\\" hardcover book. I love \\"art of\\" and \\"making of\\" type of books so this was a very pleasant surprise.  Even cooler was the the bound pages from Wolfgang Petersen's actual shooting script with his handwritten notes and sketches. I've never seen a director's actual shooting script reproduced in this manner. The additional 30 minutes of footage in this cut is seamless and enjoyable. It's great buy for any fans of the movie... I totally recommend it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|2001's \\"Band of Brothers\\" is Tom Hanks' and Steven Spielberg's absolutely superb dramatization of Stephen Ambrose's account of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Originally aired on HBO as a mini-series, and later on the History Channel, the DVD collection includes all ten episodes plus some extra features on the making of the series.<br /><br />Each episode captures a piece of the story of Easy Company in the Second World War: The stand-up of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Toccoa, Georgia; the two brutal years of tough training that bonded the men together; the D-Day airborne drop into France and the fight for the Normandy beachhead; the drop into Holland as part of Operation Market-Garden; the desperate defense of Bastogne at Christmas 1944; the fight into Germany in 1945; and occupation duty in Austria at the end of the war.<br /><br />The series clears shows its extraordinary production values and dedication to authenticity.  The producers wisely chose a collection of relatively unknown actors; at the time of production, only \\"Friends\\" alumni David Schwimmer was well-known. The cast are allowed to inhabit their characters over the course of the series.  Damon Lewis and Ron Livingston are perfect as the two young officers at the center of the narrative. Lewis portrays Dick Winters, arguably the hero of Ambrose's original narrative and one of the featured speakers in the commentary by the real veterans of Easy Company, sprinkled throughout the episodes.<br /><br />Each episode is a complete story by itself, typically centering on one or more members of Easy Company.  The look at war is tough, realistic, unflinching, capturing the tough choices and tough deals that war hands out, yet ultimately sympathetic to the young men who made up Easy Company.  A brief retrospective at the end captures some of the fates of the Easy Company soldiers and reinforces the point of the series.  These were ordinary Americans who came together to form a nearly unbreakable unit through three years of war; the survivors went on with their lives afterward, but were forever changed by their experience together.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" is most highly recommended as a superb, even unmatched viewing experience and as a valid piece of history in its own right.  Currahee!ough three years of war; the survivors went on with their lives afterward, but were forever changed by their experience together.    \\"Band of Brothers\\" is most highly recommended as a superb, even unmatched viewing experience and as a valid piece of history in its own right.

1416905014|4.0|I purchased this to give to my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves Cinderella.  The book is absolutely wonderful and is full of wonderful popups on each page.  Even some of the corners open up.  My daughter and I were amazed at it.  The only problem with it, was a small hole on the front of the fold on the book.  It's not huge, so I'm not going to return it.  I'm sure we will have so much fun reading the book with her.
0887307280|4.0|The book is good and tells you most of the pitfalls you will encounter as a small business owner who works in the business.  I felt he explained the pitfalls very well, was a bit short in providing the \\"how to\\" fix the problems.  At the end of the book, you are given an opportunity to hire the author (or his representative) as your business coach ... that is probably where you learn the \\"how to \\" stuff.    The book is a quick read, easy to understand and digest.  I would recommend this as a mandatory read for anyone wishing to start their own business or anyone that has started a small business within the past 10 years.

B00005JPLW|5.0|It is a wonderful - powerful movie.  I truly enjoyed.  NOT for kids however.  I am a history buff and the movie was fasinating to me.  Better at home than theater.  Because I am a woman and found the  theater a bit public for this film.  Men are not wearing very much.  This will be a classic film.  One to watch yearly perhaps.

0143038419|3.0|Overall, I liked the book.  But I found it increasingly tedious, especially the whole middle section about her sojourn in India.  One long description of her meditation technique would have painted the picture clearly enough.  What keeps you from being overly turned off by the author's narcissim is her sense of humor.  I found this book generally interesting, but I'm not sure it's transformative in that if you don't buy into the whole hocus pocus stuff, it just boils down to being a generally entertaining travel journal.
B00005JPFH|1.0|This movie is probably one of the worst ever made.  It is an embarassment to all those involved and as a society that would actually put down hard earned cash to see a cultural icon so badly, hack-kneed, and sloppily put portrayed as to include a rip-off of Jerry Lewis' \\"the Nutty Professor\\" (the ridiculous piano bar sequence)we should morn the loss of cinema.  This THING can't even be called a \\"popcorn movie\\" as it makes me sick to my stomach.  I'd thought perhaps they would artistically (yes you heard that right, artistically, like so many of the Venom plotlines from the book)save the franchise.  Thomas Hayden Church was a great casting choice, but that was the only right move made in the film.  Then they spoiled it with the retro-active continuity (making sandman uncle Ben's killer) and with the worst move of all (even worse than their casting choice for Mary Jane going unammended was the addition of weakling/weaklink Topher \\"I'm not an Eddie Brock\\" Grace.    If you liked this movie, you're a fool, if you buy it you're certifiable and you've my deepest sympathies.  As for Sam Raimi, the dollars can roll in to enternity but the last good, stylistically cohesive film he's made was Army of Darkness.  Now I'm starting to wonder if those directorial choices were in fact choices or just limitations of a limited director with an even more limited archive of knowledge.  Yeah...not good.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|A local newspaper writer had written a column regarding the movie ONCE which intrigued me.  It only played in our rural area for a short time, so I didn't get to see it. But I took his enthusiasm to Amazon and purchased the album, and was not disappointed.  It is delightful, easy, rythmical, and not tiresome.  Some songs even bring back hints of the sound of an early Cat Stevens.  I look forward to acquiring the movie, but in the meantime, I shall listen many times.  The musicians were recently on Letterman and brought a smile to my face.
B00005JPFH|2.0|I am a huge Spiderman fan or I wouldnt have given it 2 stars. I really liked the first two films. This movie does not live up to the hype. It could have been better if it didnt have Sandman.Two many charcters and not enough story.I was excited about venom being in the movie.Its a let down.When Venom finally makes his short lived apperance you barley see him. He is always got his mask pulled back and you got Topher Grace(Scary!)It really takes you away from the movie. When spiderman and venom are fighting both have their mask off.I waited in excitment to see spidy and venom fight and got Tobey vs Topher.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I saw the movie before ever reading a single book. I liked it I supposed, but it was just OK. After reading the book, I did find that the movie was pretty much spot on in regards to translating it from book to screen. The characters were perfectly cast I thought and I loved the score. I am still a huge HP fan regardless so I will watch this movie again and again if I happened to catch it on TV.
B00005JPRF|4.0|i saw the midnight showing of this film, and i must say.  while i was not dissappointed completely, sometimes i found that the movie was all over the place. the storyline could've been tighter, but all-in-all, not half bad. it was better than RE2. (spoiler alert) keep in mind, the ending does absolutely nothing but set you up for Resident evil IV. however, there were some good points--when alice uses telekinesis to kill the birds, that was a very well-shot sequence. the audience cheered. (end) it was low on zombie attacks, but did keep me concerned about the ragtag group of survivors.  and the action sequences were top notch.
1400063515|2.0|The author expressed his strong negative opinions on statistics, econometrics, some finance professors, some Nobel Prize winners, etc. The whole point is that traditional stat, econ, finance techniques are mostly around the first moment (mean) but the distributions in finance tend to be non-normal and it's the risk that we should pay more attention to. That's a point few people would disagree with. What the author may not have known is that there are stat techniques out there that handle all the issues mentioned - while it's true that there's a lot of room for improvement, it's misleading to say that this is an area ignored by the academics and practitioners. While fractals are recommended, it is not clearly stated in the boook how fractals can be directly applied to the area of investment finance.<br /><br />There is a 2007 issue in American Statistican dedicated to the debate with the author and is highly recommended.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Director: Kinji Fukasaku.<br />A stunningly original, if intensely graphic satire, Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is based around the concept of 42 school children being taken to a remote Pacific island to engage in a very real death match. Set in a Japanese colony of the very near future, the action follows those youngsters as they are dispatched on the island where with three days worth of arms and food, they must fight to the death. The ultimate winner - and, of course, there can be only one - is then deemed fit to retake their place in Japanese society. In equal measures, violent and humourous, Battle Royale ignores the accepted parameters of the average action movie, and instead offers a savage critique of the pressures and motivations of young people in today's society. As you'd expect for a movie with killing as its central theme, there's a tremendous amount of bloodshed in Battle Royale but, believe it or not, it's thoughtfully handled by the director.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This truly is a gem of a film. Everyone I know loves this movie, young and old. I simply adore it. You cant help but smile with every scene. Its just a joyful type of film. Everybody will fall in love with the pig named Babe after watching it.

B00005JPQR|5.0|Third and possibly last instalment of Robert Ludlum's Bourne series is with us, and fans can breathe easy as it's a deserving send-off. Jason Bourne (Damon) is getting ever closer to uncovering his real identity and those behind the mysterious operation Blackbrier. Standing in his way are multiple assassins, CIA agents and Noah Vosen (Strathairn), a no-nonsense chief operative given an unusual amount of room to conduct missions as he sees fit. Getting caught up in the plot is inadvisable as names, dates and places come at you a mile a minute, and the best thing to do is remember the really important stuff, sit back and let it roll over you. It's the fastest Bourne yet, with the action skipping between Turin, London, Virginia, Madrid, Tangier and New York, all held together by director du jour Paul Greengrass. Greengrass, returning after directing The Bourne Supremacy and United 93, brings his usual hyper-kinetic camera movements and, with the perpetual tension-riddled score, The Bourne Ultimatum boasts a pace not seen in espionage thrillers before. But the praise must go to the writing team, who somehow are able to write multiple phone conversations with the same anxiety as say, a car chase.  If one was to pick holes, it's arguable that The Bourne Ultimatum can be a little convenient at times, but the Bourne franchise deserves a coffee break after making everything three times as hard for themselves in previous rounds. An action movie with brains, this is some serious fun.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|What a waste of money, and another cheap attempt at the movie industry to get people to buy multiple versions of the same movie. A total rip off that it doesn't include the trailers. They could have easily split them up and put some on each DVD release. No, of course they just want everyone to buy another version of the movie when they release the inevitable double feature version.<br /><br />Even with that, this movie I just couldn't stand. Who is it supposed to appeal to ? No wonder it was such a bomb at the box office. One hand you have extremely long dialogue scenes where Tarentino just rehashes his former movies. It's like he's trying to recreate the Resevoir Dogs dinner scene with female models. Then after this tedious mess we get the crazy car chases and what not. I think if the movie was cut down to a 30 minute short it might have been bareable.<br /><br />OK we get it, it's supposed to be a 70's B movie. Wow you're so artisitic. Give me a break, it's just way too obvious with all the grain lines. I can do the same thing on Windows Movie Maker. This movie just screams look at me I'm so clever, and it resulted in me hating everything about it.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I hate horror and gore, this show is not about that. There is plenty of blood though. The direction and the actors never seem to make things to heavy which is pefect to balance everything out. This show is really dark and will put a big old grin on your face. Acting, story, imagery, characters are all fantastic. Great Show! Not for the faint of heart.
B00006ADD5|5.0|First released in 1962, and restored some 27 years later, this slightly longer version of the movie is a must see on the big screen - if only for the epic vision of the director, David Lean. A youthful Peter O'Toole takes the central role of T.E. Lawrence, a man who managed to unite several Arab tribes in defiance of the attacking Ottoman Turks in the First World War. This is no simple biopic, however. Lawrence of Arabia is a massive picture in every sense of the word, with Lean utilising the vast expanses of the desert in a way no other director had, or indeed has, since. If you haven't seen it before, there is no excuse. If you have, there's still no excuse.
B000ASDFEU|4.0|Great movie over all, some over acting on the US side of things other then that good actor's, very good story, plot was well planed. yes I'd buy this dvd. little pricey though Walmart $6.00 amazon 20.00 sorry but I had to go to the $6.00. Don't get wrong I shop here all the time.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|This movie should be included in everyone's collection. In mine it has a place in the Halloween section since I love the holiday so much. It is perfect for kids and the whole family to watch.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Hot Fuzz...WOW. it literally is one of the finest films of 07. It has everything you need to kick back and relax and be blown away. At first, it's a spoof of dumb action flicks(which I love, Michael Bay rocks), but then...it becomes one of them. Highly reccomended.
B00005JPLW|5.0|It is easy to navigate and you find what are you looking for.  Good prices and a great quality and even more a fast delivery service.  I never expected to receive my product so fast!!!
B00000583F|5.0|This is a classic in every sense of the word. Sleep was one of those bands that had a heavy influence on most of todays fuzzed out stoner rock. Matt Pike has went on to form High on Fire which are good to but in my opinion Sleep was better. Holy mountain has a wicked sound, and it's slow as hell. They have huge build ups until they drag in a riff that will melt your speakers.The Orange amps they used give this release a distinct sound. This album is worth every penny.
B000MRA5NS|3.0|I'm a bit of a James Bond snob and to me Sean Connery seems like the only real bond.  However, I think that Daniel Craig did a pretty good job (much better than Pierce Brosnan in my opinion).  There were a lot of really weird parts, like when James ordered the champagne when he hooked up with the beauty at his hotel... Then he leaves?  Sean Connery would have stayed and finished the job.  If you can get past the fact that Daniel Craig isn't Sean Connery it's a decent movie

I can honestly say they have given me excellent and quick customer service.  I plan to continue to shop at [...].

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural has been one of my favorite shows since it premiered- the writing is good, consistent and always engaging. The acting is really great- this season saw great character development brought to life  by two very talented actors. Both Jared and Jensen delivered week in and week out.  What I loved about this set besides the outstanding video quality - though I would really like to see Supernatural also offered in HD HINT HINT! - I really loved the bonus features. The gag reel was fun- the episode commentaries were really insightful and the webisode thing at the end with the tons and tons of bonus stuff on practically every epi was something I had not seen done so completely before.  Kudos to the team that produced these dvds- this is the kind of bonuses that we buy DVDs for!
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira (Katsuhiro Otomo, 1988)<br /><br />It's impossible to pick one American animated film as archetypal. While Disney reigned supreme as the king of the Western animated feature for decades, choosing a single Disney film as archetypal is just impossible. Dumbo over Cinderella, or Sleeping Beauty over Pinocchio? Heresy, I tell you. (Or you could take Jonathan Rosenbaum's way out and include shorts like \\"Hellzapoppin'\\", which actually would merit some consideration.) It is not nearly as difficult with Eastern animation: there is Akira, and there is everything else. I watched it again last night for the first time in a few years, and as always, it was an entirely new experience.<br /><br />I heard it opined once that while Akira is often bandied about as the greatest piece of anime ever made, it's an awful movie to start watching anime with (I believe the term the chap used was \\"advanced anime\\"). This is absolutely the case. Akira is not only violent, chaotic, and relatively confusing visually, it also sports a labyrinthine plot and, if the discrepancies between the subtitles and the dubbing are anything to go by (I don't know nearly enough Japanese yet to be able to translate more than a word here and there), a pretty bad job in translation. (There are whole threads on OMDB spent doing nothing but dissecting silliness in some of the translations. They're fun to read.) That said, once a person has a grounding in anime with more straightforward films by, say, Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kawajiri (and it would also be nice to get some sort of grounding in Japanese culture that can be read between the lines of fantastic live-action Japanese films made by directors like Ozu, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Miike, and the nation's other greats), Akira is an absolute must-see, and one you should probably return to multiple times as you get older, so you notice more.<br /><br />About the shortest plot synopsis I can give you is this: Kaneda (voiced in the English version by Cam Clarke) and Tetsuo (Stanley Gurd) are members of a motorcycle gang in 21st-century Neo-Tokyo, a small subsection of the city rebuilt after World War III. As the two of the, and other members of the gang, are embroiled in a battle with another gang, Tetsuo, driving at full speed across a bridge, is involved in an accident involving an odd-looking grey child. The government, of whom the grey kid is a ward, come to claim him, and take Tetsuo off with them as well. Kaneda attempts to rescue Tetsuo with the help of his new girlfriend Kaori (Barbara Goodson), while Tetsuo tries to survive the experiments to which the secret government agency that kidnapped him is subjecting him. As well, Tetsuo finds that his mind is being invaded by Akira, and he has to find out who Akira is in order to save his sanity.<br /><br />This is only the tip of the iceberg. Subplots and tangents abound; there's easily enough material here to double the films two-hour-plus running time, and that's the movie's biggest drawback: Otomo is trying to pack the whole run of his manga into one movie. Because of this, the film demands repeated viewings; you'll only get the tip of the iceberg the first time you see it.  This is in no way to suggest, however, that Akira is not worth the time you will put into those repeated viewings, for it certainly is. The best description of it I've ever heard actually doesn't come from film criticism; Dan Rather, filtered through The Evolution Control Committee, once talked of a \\"wild and woolly semi-automatic truck bomb,\\" and that's as good a description of this two-hour smack in the face as any. The film has two paces, fast and breakneck. Its violence level ranges from the uncomfortable to the unconscionable, and the only time its plot is not almost impossibly complex is in the first five minutes. It commands you to pay attention to it in the same way a gruesome car accident does. And, like that car accident, once you have caught a glimpse, it is impossible to look away. (I know this is true in my case. The first time I saw a piece of it was in an industrial club. Once I saw it, I spent the entire evening on a barstool staring at the screen and ignoring everyone else I was there with.) Whether it makes any sense to you the first time around may not even matter; images from it will stay with you long after you've finished watching. They'll draw you back.<br /><br />Not a perfect film, but pretty darned close. **** ½first time I saw a piece of it was in an industrial club.

B00005NC66|1.0|Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1959)<br /><br />After seeing Pierrot le Fou, finding it awful, and then reading Roger Ebert's recent revised review of it (\\"...while I once wrote of it as Godard's most virtuoso display of his mastery of Hollywood genres,\\" I now see it more as the story of silly characters who have seen too many Hollywood movies.\\" Ebert, 16Aug07), I thought that perhaps I'd just picked a bad Godard movie to start with, and went for the one that everyone and his mother loves: Breathless, Godard's first film, about which Ebert has famously said \\"Modern movies begin here...\\". And that may well be true. Recognizing that it is seminal, however, does not make it any less boring.<br /><br />I re-read Ebert's 2003 analysis of the film just before beginning to write this review, and I'm certainly not going to quibble with any of the points he makes there. Of course not; they're all absolutely true. \\"You cannot even begin to count the characters played by Pacino, Beatty, Nicholson, Penn, who are directly descended from Jean-Paul Belmondo's insouciant killer Michel.\\" Indeed. If I'm reading Ebert (and watching the film) correctly, Breathless is a sort of anti-noir. It has most of the elements of a good noir; a doomed protagonist (Belmondo), a hauntingly lovely femme fatale (Otto Preminger protege Jean Seberg), murder and mayhem, some fun cameos (the one scene in this movie I really loved was the press conference with noir genius Jean-Pierre Melville), the whole lot. Put this in America and give it to, say, Billy Wilder, and wow.<br /><br />But Wilder did not make it; Jean-Luc Godard did. Autant-Lara said of this film that \\"...a minor producer hired a minor director to make a minor crime movie running a maximum of five thousand metres. But the director filmed eight thousand metres...\\" Perhaps Wilder, with his clout, could have made a movie of the length Godard envisioned for this movie. (Or Melville, for that matter.) But Godard's 150-minute epic had to be cored, peeled, sliced, and stewed down to eighty-nine; as with the infamous screw-ups in Antonioni's Blow-Up that ended up being considered revolutionary, Godard stated that the jump-cuts now recognizable to any TV viewer (aside from being used in thousands of commercials, the jump-cut technique was a mainstay of Homicide: Life on the Street, one of the finest TV shows of the nineties) were the products of simple pragmatism: \\"...when we came to [Belmondo and Seberg in the car], which had to be shortened like the others, instead of slightly shortening both, the editor and I flipped a coin...'we're going to cut out one or the other altogether, and then we will simply join the remaining shots'.\\" Pragmatism once again wins the day. (Modern viewers seeing the film for the first time are likely to see that scene and think about Homicide. I did, long before reading that piece.)<br /><br />What remains, when you strip away the mystique and the seminality, however, doesn't necessarily have to be enjoyable. Thousands of fantasy novels read by millions of people are descended, directly or indirectly, from the Eddas. Have you ever read the Eddas? No, you probably haven't. Some find them enjoyable. I have my doubts that ninety or so percent of Lord of the Rings fans would agree with them. Why? Because Tolkien distilled what was there, embellished it, and then added his own artistic touches to make it his own epic, and he succeeded famously. Tens of thousands of copies of Lord of the Rings sell every year. Stack that up against maybe hundreds of copies of the Eddas. And so it is with Breathless; all those Pacino/Beatty/Nicholson/Penn characters (and the odd exclusion of DeNiro) quite simply did it better. Hell, look at John Cusack in The Grifters. (For some odd reason, that performance strikes me as the closest analogue. Don't ask me why, I've no idea.)<br /><br />Yes, it's important, and it changed the face of filmmaking forever, but unlike a number of other films of that stripe, Breathless has not aged well in the least. To use one more quote, filmmaker and critic Tao Ruspoli says of Breathless that it \\"...may be amusing to watch without attempting any sort of analysis, [but] its status as a masterpiece can only be understood through a careful analysis of its historical context.\\" I submit that a number of other, just as important, films don't require such context in order to be enjoyable (or, as \\"enjoyable\\" is not the precise word one would probably use for such movies as Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will, we'll substitute \\"powerful\\") to the modern viewer. Night of the Living Dead, just as important as Breathless, still holds up today not just because it changed the face of filmmaking, but because it's a cracking good piece of filmmaking. Similarly Murnau's Nosferatu or Welles' Citizen Kane. So why bother with it unless you're a film student who's been assigned it in class? Gets a single star for its historical importance, but certainly doesn't merit a recommendation unless you like gaping at Jean Seberg (which is, actually, quite a valid reason to watch it). *use one more quote, filmmaker and critic Tao Ruspoli says of Breathless that it \\"...may be amusing to watch without attempting any sort of analysis, [but] its status as a masterpiece can only be understood through a careful analysis of its historical context.\\" I submit that a number of other, just as important, films don't require such context in order to be enjoyable (or, as \\"enjoyable\\" is not the precise word one would probably use for such movies as Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will, we'll substitute \\"powerful\\") to the modern viewer.

0345347951|4.0|It is written by the master of the genre, Arthur C. Clarke, and originally published in the pre-lunar-landing world of 1953.<br />It is still in print and some critics consider it to be the best science fiction novel of all time. Of course, stalwart devotees of Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, or Isaac Asimov will argue that such accolades are debatable.<br />Several of Clarke's themes and/or motifs in Childhood's End continue to resonate with me, and I want to focus on one of those today.<br />It concerns the idea of animal cruelty. Or, more correctly, human cruelty to animals.<br />In the novel (this will be nowhere near a detailed synopsis of the book) extraterrestrials come to earth and hover in their huge space ships over principal cities. They station themselves, suspended fifty kilometers above the world's capital cities. Think of the movie Independence Day, only bigger, and even more determined! A nuclear missile, fired at one ship, simply disappears. These aliens mean business. They didn't travel across the universe to learn how to play Yahtzee!<br />The pilots and inhabitants of these ships (called The Overlords) are heard, but not seen. In the initial decades of their hoverment (my word), they speak to the earth only once and that is to announce that they are now in charge. For the most part, the Overlords' dictates are expressed by their chosen human messenger, Stormgren, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. From their ominous position they begin to institute their ideals of earthly reform. All of mankind's space exploration is to cease. Mankind is ordered to mend its ways, to become more cosmically hospitable. National rivalries are abolished, trade barriers dissolved. One World is made a reality under the jurisdiction of a truly powerful United Nations.<br />They present the world with a device to see events in the past, proving every religion wrong. They offer a cure for all diseases. All in all, the alien intentions seem quite beneficial to mankind as a whole, that is, until their desire to posess all of the children is revealed.<br />But I will leave that part of the story for you to discover, should you desire to read the book. It is a wild ride.<br />Now, in the midst of these planetary changes (and this is what I wanted to focus on) the aliens introduce one really interesting new policy.<br />The all too human sport of cruelty to animals is universally outlawed.<br />This is illustrated in the novel when Spain is asked to stop the sport of bull-fighting. Cruelty to animals is to be ipso-facto abolished.<br />Spain does not want to comply. And so what happens (you are not supposed to ask HOW it happens)... what happens is that when Spain ignores the ultimatum, well, it makes the next bull-fight very interesting indeed.<br />What happens is that whenever the bull is stabbed, the people in the stadium, as well as those watching on television, experience the same pain as is being experienced by the animal.<br />When the bull is stabbed, the whole stadium cries out in pain!<br />Hmmm.... how long do you think it takes for mankind to catch on to that little tidbit of revolutionary change huh?<br />Exactly.<br />Not long at all.<br />Childhood's End is a wonderful book. Worthwhile.t is, until their desire to posess all of the children is revealed.  But I will leave that part of the story for you to discover, should you desire to read the book. It is a wild ride.

0345347951|5.0|I first read this book when I was a teenager. I would constantly re-read it throughout my teens, almost to the point where I had the whole book committed to memory. the impression it made upon me was so strong that it formed part of the foundation of the criteria by which I would percive and judge spiritual matters.<br /><br />Clarke succeeded in making some monumental points with this book. He actually used the language of science to describe God; absolute, omnipotent. He described the \\"evil / devil\\" element of the Overlords in a way that reveals what it really is; a state of slavery to the material universe; and in the end powerless and impotent. And described humanity as a work in progress, its full potential for achievement yet to be realized.<br /><br />It is also humbling and sobering in that it makes all the likes, dislikes, dreams, and pursuits of the world that human beings expend so much energy and passion over look insignificant and meaningless.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Echoes of falling snow... It's a remarkable, if not implausible, notion. As is the notion that someone could recapture the traditional Christmas spirit for a new generation as Bing Crosby did for my parents' and grandparents'...    By my own admission - it's only September. 2007. Nearly a year since this album's original release and well ahead of the Christmas season. Yet it deserves a renewed push towards Christmas classics status that the previous 181 reviewers have initiated. That's a credit to Sarah fans as it is to those whose spirit of Christmas revolves around images of childhood bliss mixed with bittersweet realisations of adulthood in the \\"noughties\\".    \\"River\\" is the first standout track you will embrace. The piano & guitar dance like snowflakes in a gentle wind around Sarah's voice. Forget the comparisons to Joni Mitchell - with all due respect - but I never knew the original and it won't matter to you either. It'll cling to you for warmth & meaning nonetheless. As will \\"Wintersong\\" - an original Sarah song. For anyone who's had to face Christmas alone, its particularly poignant yet completely forgiving and loving in its nature. Completely fitting for Christmas. For our generation.     What makes this CD exceptional is the odd balance it strikes in its composition and tone. Again, for those who've ever had to spend Christmas away from loved ones, \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" will both evoke and sate those emotions. \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" finally gets the treatment its title deserves with its soft keyboard strokes that bounce merrily like jingle bells on mittens. Yet on \\"Christmas Time is Here\\", Sarah's melancholy voice, accompanied by Diane Krall's drunken piano, lullaby us with the bittersweetness that - I believe - confronts the fading optimism of the true meaning of Christmas in this post-9/11 world. \\"Silent Night\\" follows suit. Achingly so.    But of all this - if there's one enduring quality you can take away from this collection -it's the emotion that Sarah's voice brings to the music. It sets the tone throughout. Beautifully.    For true Sarah fans, \\"The First Noel/Mary Mary\\", \\"Songs For A Winter's Night\\", and \\"In The Bleak Mid-Winter\\" leave only her own unique footprints in the snow.    Maybe echoes of falling snow isn't such an implausible notion after all...

1400079179|1.0|This book is stupid because they get ideas from non-canonical writings! It has a similar plot to the supposedly lost Family Tomb of Jesus, but this is a more fancy story-teller version, non-documentary style.<br /><br />People always love to blaspheme Christianity -- do it to any other religion and you'll start World War 3! And that is the truth!<br /><br />I wrote a review about that Jesus Family Tomb documentary and I have similar opinions to the Divinci Code. I have ran out of steam, but I know of many stories of non-believers calling out to God to ask if he exist! Even the ex lead singer of Korn is now a Christian? How do you explain that? Nico McBrain out of Iron Maiden is Christian.<br /><br />I truly do believe people see too much in these non-canonical writings, \\"hidden meanings\\" in paintings like the Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. These paintings are classic Western art! Everything great is one day spoiled I think... There is always some clown denigrating great things!<br /><br />Anyway, this book is a rip off of other books like The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.\\"<br /><br />Don't read trash like this, go to the source first! That's half the problem with this world!<br /><br />There has always been people throughout the millennia preaching a different Jesus, making up things... and this book is just a much more elaborate story telling deliberately just trying to upset the Christian world!<br /><br />Author like Dan Brown just want to shock people with familiar religious ideas so he can acquire a huge bank balance, that is all he cares about. Many people dislike Jesus but they make money from it somehow and plenty of people have bought this book because it trashes Jesus! \\"It's not cool to love Jesus\\" as what they think.
B000003RCY|5.0|I want to make this short and simple, get it. This album is by far my personal favorite amongst the other Rammstein albums. Great album from start to finish. Every song has it's own personality, and if you don't like one at first, you will eventually grow into it.

The day I bought the book I think it ranked about # 85, two days later, its up to number 7 !!  Im so glad she brings these sometimes unknown and important stories for us to be able to become a part of and read.  (looks like the price dropped too in the two days since I bought it !!) I'm sure its a great read and can't wait for it to arrive!
B000QQH4YS|4.0|A few months ago I came across the Robocop trilogy pack at Sam's Club for a discounted price,put it in my shopping cart and was headed to the check out line. At the last minute I decided not to purchase it because I was only a fan of the original Robocop. The saying \\"a good thing comes to those who wait\\" must be true, because a month later I saw a commercial for the 20th anniversary collector's edition. This was a must own for me. I remember watching this movie at the the theater when I was a teenager and I was blown away.The mix af action,comedy,drama, and over the top violence was a sight to behold. The dvd itself is a great investment. It's loaded with special features:rated and unrated version of the movie,audio commentary by the director,deleted scenes,never before seen featurettes, a limited edition tin case, and most importantly-improved picture and sound quality. This annivesary edition of Robocop is a great edition to your movie library.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Excellent series about a serial killer in search of killers, with another serial killer looking on.  Strong on language and lots of gore. Excellent.  I am surprised it did not get a run on a more major UK TV channel (it appeared in the UK on Fox's FX Channel late at night). A good cast and lots of small sub plots involving a sister and girl friend.  I eagerly await series 2.  Don't miss this.
0156907399|5.0|This is not a book for everyone. It wasn't meant for me, and it is not one that I'll ever re-visit, but I can acknowledge that it is a minor classic.    Much like the far superior Under the Volcano, this book focuses on how the thing is said, and not the thing itself. The plot is spare and banal, and what little action there is is tangential: what matters to Woolf is the inner psychology, the interpersonal dynamics, the thoughts, perceptions, emotions and feelings.     The book has a calamitous exordium, populated with clunkers such as this:    \\"Then, up behind the great black rock, almost every evening spurted irregularly, so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came, a fountain of white water, and then, while one waited for that, one watched, on the pale semicircular beach, wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly, a film of mother of pearl.\\"    But, gradually, the lyricism and prose pick up, and become almost sublime in many parts. Woolf does not have much to say, but she says it very beautifully, once she's found her sea-legs.     To the Lighthouse is very overrated at #15 on the MLA 100...it should be ranked far beneath All the King's Men, Appointment in Samarra, and the incredibly brilliant Pale Fire. (Most English professors would doubtless disagree.) That said, it does deserve a spot on the list, and is not an aesthetically devoid waste of time like Wide Sargasso Sea.
1594489505|5.0|Those of us who love great literature are often left profoundly disappointed with follow on works of contemporary novelists.  After brilliant literary debuts, many novelists seem to struggle mightily to produce a worthy second effort.  A Thousand Splendid Suns represents an unusual and pleasantly surprising exception.  Combining superb character development with an intricate plotline, Khaled Hosseini duplicates The Kite Runner's astonishing success with another beautifully crafted literary masterpiece.<br /><br />A singularly poignant story by this gifted writer, A Thousand Splendid Suns surpasses expectations like few other second novels. While again chronicling the last 30 years of Afghan history, Hosseini traces the lives of his characters as they confront the dual challenges of an intolerant Afghan society and a perpetually fractured central government unable to adequately provide for the security and other basic needs of the Afghan people.  Hosseini's characters struggle to survive in a country facing persistent civil war, drought, and famine.  We watch sympathetically as they labor under the false promises offered first by communism and then Islamic fundamentalism.<br /><br />As he did with The Kite Runner, the author lays bare the inhumanity of the succession of governments ruling the Afghan people from the late 1970s through the late 1990s.  From the apocryphal Soviet puppet regime assuming power in 1979 to the violent warlords of the early to mid 1990s to the Islamic Taliban movement of the late 1990s, the reader quickly realizes that Afghans have been dealt an awful hand.  Indeed, contemporary Afghan history is a fascinating study of one Central Asian nation's steady, continuous downward spiral.<br /><br />Amazingly, in the face of such ruin and despair the Afghan people remain stoic - forever hopeful that they will see better days ahead for both their broken society and their own sad lives.  As we experience the many difficulties facing these proud people generally, we witness two remarkable Afghan women, Mariam and Laila, who struggle to make their way in a male-dominated society in which women can be subjected to unspeakable cruelty.<br /><br />What truly sets Hosseini apart from other great novelists is his ability to develop the sympathetic character.  First, the author instills in his two principal characters those qualities that make them uniquely Afghan.  Ruggedly individualistic, self-possessed, and perhaps loyal to a fault, Mariam and Laila both boldly and unreservedly decide to improve their tragic circumstances.<br /><br />Capable of enduring inconceivable struggles - delivering a child through Caesarian section without anesthesia, for instance - Mariam and Laila refuse to indulge in self-pity. Whether it is the evil Rasheed, the two women's sadistic husband, or even members of the brutal Taliban, these women confront their tormentors. And they remain unbowed in the face of seemingly endless tragedy.<br /><br />Though they may share qualities such as independence and fortitude, Laila's and Mariam's characters differ quite dramatically.<br /><br />There's Laila - strong yet vulnerable, permitted early to glimpse a better life for herself yet robbed of any real chance to pursue it.  While her circumstances continue to devolve - first her beloved Tariq leaves her for a better life in Pakistan and then her parents are both killed before her eyes in a rocket attack - she remains hopeful that her situation will somehow improve. She devotes her life to her children's care while living a barely tolerable existence in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. Though she carefully plans to pursue better conditions, her efforts mostly end in frustration.  Eventually, though, her happy ending finds Laila.  She is able to carve out a life of love and service in a Kabul orphanage with Tariq and her children.<br /><br />Mariam, by contrast, tends to accept her fate - though she demonstrates repeatedly that she,too, has her limits.  She desires a better life for herself yet lacks Laila's capacity to act on her hopes and dreams. The most achingly tragic of Hosseini's characters, Mariam begins her life as the illegitimate child of a Herati businessman and one of his servants.  Deeply loving and respectful of her father, Mariam longs to live with him and his other children but instead is thrust at the tender age of 15 into an arranged marriage to Rasheed.  Not able to be with her father and enjoy the life of which she dreamed, Mariam eventually resigns herself to being Rasheed's dutiful wife.<br /><br />As if preordained, Mariam's life runs its wretched course when, in an effort to save Laila's life, she murders Rasheed.  In a final act of love for her \\"sister\\", she steadfastly refuses to implicate Laila in the murder.  She is jailed and then prosecuted in a sham trial under the Taliban's Shari'a law. Her simple yet deeply meaningful life ends unceremoniously at the hands of a coldly indifferent Taliban executioner wielding an AK-47 assault rifle. So her life ends as it started: She dies alone and impoverished.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns' beauty is in the depiction of two Afghan women's indomitable will to survive through hardship most of us would find utterly impossible to endure.<br /><br />Another of Hosseini's great gifts as a writer is the pace of his stories.  A Thousand Splendid Suns, like The Kite Runner before it, proceeds at just the right tempo. It both holds our interest and encourages us to read further. We are anxious to find out how the characters will handle the next challenge life throws at them.<br /><br />While entertaining us with his tale of two uncommon Afghan women, Hosseini also educates us.  We feel deeply for these pitiable characters, and as the story unfolds we experience a rollercoaster of emotional ups and downs.  The result is a deep sympathy not only for the characters but for the Afghan people in general. However, it is clear that Hosseini wants us to appreciate what Afghans have endured and not to pity them. Ultimately, we learn to respect their extraordinary courage and actually find ourselves cheering for them through their many struggles.<br /><br />It is difficult to imagine an author desiring more for his readers. To be sure, Hosseini aims quite high with A Thousand Splendid Suns... and he once again succeeds magnificently.<br /><br />A brilliant follow on effort!yet lacks Laila's capacity to act on her hopes and dreams.

B00006SFLV|3.0|Ah, a trip back in time to those charming, innocent days of yesteryear as via the miracle of the DVD boxed set we can take in one of the most over-rated, over-promoted, most underwhelming let-downs in television history. I remember how throughout the summer of 1994 ABC touted this show as the second coming of all things great, and since I was in the target demographic, I fell for it. I remember thinking it was sort of neat that here was a show that featured a thoughtful girl my age who was set to graduate the same year as I was, but then as episode after episode came and went even I began to lose faith that this show the critics kept telling me was so great really was all that culturally important. Week after week, though, I tuned in and watched Angela emote about this and that, be the subject teen drinking, drugs, eating disorders, homosexuality, her questionable infatuation with Jordan Catellano (a pretty darn good-looking Jared Leto, I admit) her declining relationship with her parents (\\"Dad and I used to be pretty tight, but the fact is my breasts have come between us.\\") the out of control life course of her new BFF Rayanne (a girl who could eat anything and stay SO thin!), or the loss of touch that had come up so confusingly regarding her one-time number one girlfriend Sharon Cherski. (And what a name!)<br /><br />All that might've been tolerable but the simple fact is the quality of the series seemed to wane and wax with the moon and I and most others from school noticed that this program, supposedly rooted in its realism, lost all touch with reality during its holiday episodes, be it with the appearance of the ghost of a long dead high school student making the rounds on Halloween, or a Christmas angel who imparts life lessons in community spirit. Come on!<br /><br />And lest I let it go unmentioned, Clare Danes, who has since grown up to be so beautiful, was back then simply irritating. Her habit of shedding tears on seemingly everrrrry episode, and the way she'd pucker her face all up to do it, that became a mannerism frequently parodied among those of us who watched. By the beginning of spring I finally lost patience with My So Called Life, and based on the ratings, I wasn't alone.<br /><br />Well, sentimentality forgives much and on impulse I ordered the complete series and you know what? Except for the memories it brings and its jaunt back to the mid-1990's with its fashion nightmares and cultural references,  My So Called Life sucks. I'm giving it three stars because of its ties to my own adolescence, but in my honest opinion, that's sort of like a pity kiss on a last date.her face all up to do it, that became a mannerism frequently parodied among those of us who watched.

038572179X|5.0|Literate, literary story of mistakes and their consequences that reverberate through the years. Not as gory as McEwan can be sometimes. The horror is more psychological than actual, unlike other books of his. A beautiful, moving and compelling work of fiction. Very, very good.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I had never really heard anything by the Celtic Woman group until I was on this site looking for a CD for a friend of mine. I only had to listen to a few songs before I became an avid Celtic Woman fan. I'm always on the lookout for good Celtic music, so much of the music I have encountered is misnamed as Celtic simply because there's a bagpipe playing faintly in the background. The truly Scottish/Irish songs on this CD were my favorites, but all of the songs were very well done, and I admired the group's good harmony. Unlike so much of the music that you hear today, with the singer just wailing loudly into the microphone, these women actually sang, and the songs that they chose were good. I would highly reccomend this CD to anyone who appreciates good music, even if they're not huge fans of Celtic.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|Not as impressed with this CD as all her others.  It's still good, but not ear grabbing!!
0439813786|4.0|This book was not what I expected, but I have to give it credit for combining a number of unusual artistic elements. The stark black and white drawings will probably not appeal to young children, nor will the storyline appeal to parents, since the main characters (both children) lie, cheat and steal. Of course, it's for a good cause, but may still imply that it's okay to do so. I enjoyed how the author wove together a story of a real person, into that of fictional characters, and did so convincingly. The entire idea of the automaton was fascinating and led me to pursue further research into that subject. The drawings definitely convey the pathos and charm of the principle characters and give you a sense of movement throughout the pages. Definitely worth a look at.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|What a ride. I read these comic books when I was a kid and the movie is everything I could have hoped for. Highly recommend!!!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|To look at this as some kind of genius 'homage' means willfully overlooking all of this films weak points.    Watching it in the theater, I was looking forward to learning more about Kurt Russell's character.  I was surprised when QT started to spend so much time on a group of young women that it was very hard to care much about.  This segment of the film seemed to go on and on and on and on, and after a while I started feeling sympathetic toward the Butterfly character because I thought that somehow when the script came to a climax, her character was going to be transformed in some meaningful way.    Finally, when my interest was nearly gone, all of the girls were killed within a 20-30 second sequence.  All of the film that had been rolling was just to show the viewer that Kurt was a pretty bad dude.    Why, oh why did QT feel the need for all the exposition on characters that ultimately had no meaning?  It didn't make any sense at all.  Why did he try and get the audience to invest any interest in them?  It would have been far more effective if we were only introduced to the original girls in passing and the story opened near the point when Kurt met Rose at the bar.  All the other material before that was simply nothing more than a waste of the audience's time.    After the first batch of women dies off, we are introduced to a second group of women.  Now these are more interesting, as with them the movie actually starts to show a pulse.  By the time the ladies kill Kurt, I was cheering.  Its not that I wanted to see his character dead as much as I wanted a scapegoat for all of my frustrations with the earlier part of the film.    All of the people out there with their 'homage' comments and 'but its a QT film!' ought to be tarred, feathered and run out of town, and the general public needs to get the message that this emperor simply has no clothing.  If calling this movie a brilliant homage helps you to think of yourself as some sort of sophisticate, then you deserve to have lost your money.
B00005JPQL|4.0|Stardust is a strange but magical and fun fairystale adventure. It's about a young man who finds a falling star that he promised to a spoiled girl for her hand in marriage. He is surprised that the star is the beautiful Claire Danes (Terminator 3) and it isn't long before he has to protect her.<br /><br />  An evil witch wants the star so she can eat her heart and be young forever. She's played by Michelle Pfeiffer who's in good evil form. A group of princes are competing to find her as well because whoever finds her will be the next King.<br /><br />  Robert DeNiro plays a gay pirate captain they befriend. He makes believe he's ruthless so his men respect him. DeNiro steals the show as him provides some good laughs. It's his funnest performance in awhile.<br /><br />  Stardust failed to gain big audiences in theaters and that's a shame. It was probably the most original movie to come out all summer. I strongly recommend that you to seak it out when it hits dvd.
B000J10EQU|1.0|Pre-marital sex, lame detruction of the classic suit, cheesy \\"dark\\" scenes to hide the lack of creative flying scenes, Once again they get someone to make a Superman film that knows nothing about Superman....    The only thing positive about this movie was Brandon Routh though a bit young for the timeline he made an excellent Superman.    Fan of Supe? Don't buy this dvd.........
B00001W9G0|4.0|Isn't it ironic that when asked to choose \\"The Greatest Love Stories Ever Told\\", almost NO ONE would mention the wondrous \\"The Way We Were\\". Here is a film that understands love and relationships much more than saccharine films like \\"Love Story\\", and actually invests so much in the delightful script.<br /><br />As usual Barbra Streisand is amazing. I actually heard about this movie first from Fran Drescher when she and her mother bring it up on the sitcom \\"The Nanny\\". Yeah, I was sort of late to the party, but what a party it is!<br /><br />However, if you haven't seen this, be aware that the ending will leave you emotionally devastated if you're a fan of good romances. I hold this movie even more powerful than say, \\"The Notebook\\". I would also say, that this is Streisands' best performance, much better than \\"Funny Girl\\" but not quite as amazing as \\"Yentl\\".<br /><br />A sad, pensive love story that will have you thinking about it for days. Be prepared to bawl your eyes out. This is a movie of everlasting beauty.
B00006GO7T|1.0|It must have been in the small print somewhere, yet I am not able to use the CD on any of my CD players.  This makes me very unhappy as I was looking forward to hearing the music.  I would give it ZERO stars if that was an option.
B00005NB8K|4.0|Myself, being a huge doors fan, I absolutely love this movie. Oliver Stone did a great job capturing Jim Morrison's wild life fueled by drugs and alcohol onto the big screen, but maybe he gave us a false perception of the Lizard King. Many people watch this movie to get an idea on what Jim was like, and this movie is not what it's for. Oliver Stone exaggerated a lot of thing in Jim's life to make it more movie like, which is completely okay, but people must understand this.<br /><br />As a movie, it's fantastic, and keeps us pulled into Jim's story throughout the whole thing, but don't look at this movie as a documentary.

B00005JLWN|2.0|...and a cute little puppy dog. I had to give up on this hackneyed drivel after an hour, but I have a suspicion that the hero ends up overthrowing the evil emotion-repressing dictatorship. High school English teachers with a crush on Christian Bale no doubt love this film; the rest of us will only be reminded of the many other films and books from which it derived its ideas.
B000RJO58M|4.0|I had never heard of this movie until it came out on HD DVD.  People were saying good things about it so I gave it a rent.  I was under the impression it was a comedy, but there are few funny moments in the first half.  In fact, the plot drags a bit and I was getting restless.  But momentum built and the ending of the movie was darn near hilarious.  The picture quality was excellent-especially for a combo disc and there's a lot of bass that gave my Buttkickers a good workout.  However, I have no desire to see it again so for me this one is just a rental.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Recently there have been some great movies about WWII, but it has been a while since we saw a movie about the cold war era depicting every day lives of ordinary people in the Eastern block.  The last film I recall was adaptation of Milan Kundera's book \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\".  \\"The Lives of Others\\" film is the perfect display of the kinds of people who suffer the most in the totalitarian system(s) - artists, professors and students - people generally considered as too liberal in their view of the world.  In order to preserve the privilege of being able to work at all and create as an actors, directors, writers, these individuals have to either repress their true feelings about the system they live in, or pretend that the cruelty of the system isn't there.  This may be the only film that I recall that addresses the issue of routine sexual coercion women in eastern block have to face in such society by man in powerful positions. I saw this movie in the theatre and could not help myself but hear deep sighs and expressions of disbelief of having to experience the harrasment, eavesdropping, phone monitoring. But anyone who lived in Eastern Europe knows very well that these were (and still are) common practices.  What is even more frightening is that they exist even today, in the same if not worse form particularly in the Eastern European countries.  And while today's monitoring devices, and miniature cameras are certainly less conspicuous, it is the technology of 20 years ago that makes audience more aware of how brutal these practices are no matter which decades they take place in.  No, I am not going to tell you the synopsis of this movie because it would spoil it all.  But young 32 year old director of this film has captured the essence of what it is to live in the repressive systems and be (un)willing part of it.  It also gives hope that art can wake up the most human sensibilities in all of us no matter what our moral convictions are.  However, the transforming power of art, or change in general for that matter, always comes at the steep price.  Is it worth to pay such high price?  You must see the movie to make that decision yourself.  This DVD is keeper - movie is destined to be a classic.sforming power of art, or change in general for that matter, always comes at the steep price.  Is it worth to pay such high price?

B00065MDSG|5.0|With this album King Crimson sheds the gothic melodrama of earlier progressive groups and invents its own inimitable genre. Bill Bruford, whose idiosyncratic, off-kilter, but always right-on emotional percussion forms the backbone of the album. His pulsing, shimmering syncopations are enhanced by John Wetton's thrumming bass, overlaid and brought into sharp focus by Robert Fripp's powerfully creative musical innovations. Unlike many so-called classics of the era this album still sounds fresh and original 35 years later.

B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park was at one time the most popular musical act in the world.  Their albums were smart, thoughtful, imaginative and thus largely glorified.  They came onto the scene with the brilliant `Hybrid Theory' but to me the smartest move under Linkin Parks belt was the superbly constructed `Reanimation', an album that takes `Hybrid Theory' and does just that, reimagine or reanimate each and every track.  This is not a collection of remixed tracks, same beat, same lyrics, same initial concept with just a big name rapper tagged onto the end.  No, each and every track is reconstructed with improved beats, updated lyrics and guest stars.  Even the cover art is a reanimated or reconstructed version of the original.  What I've decided to do was compare the two releases here, `Hybrid Theory' and `Reanimation' to see just how smart this move really was.<br /><br />1) Papercut vs. PPr: Kut (Remixed By Cheatshot & Jubacca Feat. Rasco and Planet Asia)<br /><br />The victor is none other that `PPr: Kut'.  By reinventing this track with a very impressive beat, starting things off with an almost tribal bellow before breaking into the update, Linkin Park has managed to make a good thing even better.  The original `Papercut' was a great song, but here with the likes of Rasco and Planet Asia adding their flare the song is elevated into a masterclass.<br /><br />2) One Step Closer vs. 1stp Klosr (The Humble Brothers Remix Feat. Jonathan Davis of KoRn)<br /><br />The victor this go around was hard to decide.  I ultimately went with `One Step Closer'.  The original is just too classic I guess.  The guitar rhythm is just so catchy and it really was the first song that Linkin Park released to make you recognize they were here to stay.  `1stp Klosr' is not a bad update by any means.  It slows things down though and loses the original feel.  Jonathan Davis works well here, and his part is the most memorable of the track.  I still love this version, I just prefer the original, I think.  Like I said, this was a hard one.<br /><br />3) With You vs. Wth>You (Chairman Hahn Remix Feat. Aceyalone)<br /><br />Both tracks are actually pretty similar, but in the end `Wth>You' hits it a little harder, and the ending with Aceyalone makes up for the similarities within.  The track was not one of my favorites off of `Hybrid Theory' but the updated version, like I said, hits things a little harder, a little tighter and ultimately is the better track.<br /><br />4) Points of Authority vs. Pts. Of Athrty (Remixed By Jay Gordon of Orgy)<br /><br />Without a doubt `Pts. Of Athrty' takes this one.  I was never really too impressed with the original `Points of Authority' but this new and improved version is so tightly orchestrated thanks in large part to Jay Gordon.  This was the first single off `Reanimation' and it suits because this is just Linkin Park doing what they do best, in a whole new way.<br /><br />5) Crawling vs. Krwlng (Remixed By Mike Shinoda Feat. Aaron Lewis of Staind)<br /><br />This was a tough one because both versions are stellar.  I want to call this one a tie but the mere fact that `Krwlng' could have been better makes me call `Crawling' the champ.  Like I said, both are astounding, but with the likes of Aaron Lewis on the reconstructed version I would have really liked to see him get his own air time instead of having to pretty much share chorus lines with Chester.  The violins and updated orchestral arrangements really make `Krwlng' fantastic though.  I just really would have loved Aaron to get his own verse, but maybe they were afraid he'd outshine them or something (the mans voice is godly).  Screw this, I'm calling a tie.  Both tracks are too impressive to call one better than the other.<br /><br />6) Runaway vs. Rnw@y (Backyard Bangers Remix Feat. Phoenix Orion)<br /><br />`Runaway' is a good rock track and was one of my favorites off of `Hybrid Theory' but `Rnw@y' capitalizes on that and creates a breathtaking adaptation of the original withimpressive beats and a really nice run by Phoenix Orion.  They took what was a generic rock track and turned into something fresh and indescribable.<br /><br />7) By Myself vs. By_Myslf (Josh Abraham & Mike Shinoda Remix Feat. Stephen Carpenter of The Deftones)<br /><br />`By Myself' was not really one of my favorite tracks on `Hybrid Theory'.  In fact I really don't remember ever listening to it more than a handful of times.  In stark contrast `By_Myslf' is one of my favorite tracks on `Reanimation' and one that I listen to constantly.  The revised chorus really allows Chester's voice to soar and the new and improved guitar work by The Deftones very own Stephen Carpenter help create a fantastic track.  The whole breakdown at the end it effortlessly orgasmic.<br /><br />8) In the End vs. Enth E Nd (Kutmasta Kurt Remix Feat. Motion Man)<br /><br />`In the End' became one of Linkin Parks most memorable and popular tracks for a very good reason.  Mike Shinoda's lyrics and vocals are spot on.  Chester's vocals are haunting and the beat is infectious.  The message is timeless and the whole construction of the track is flawless.  `Enth E Nd' is a completely different track altogether with a bouncier (yet similar) beat, new lyrics and of course Motion Man.  I can't really decide which one is better.  At first I didn't really care for this reanimated track because the original was so good but `Enth E Nd' has really grown on me.  I'll stick with `In the End' for the title for now, but a few more listens and I may change my mind.<br /><br />9) A Place for My Head vs. Plc. 4 Mie Haed (Amp Live Remix Feat. Zion of Zion I)<br /><br />Ah, my favorite track of `Hybrid Theory' meets my favorite track off `Reanimation'.  Without reservations `Plc. 4 Mie Haed' blows `A Place for My Head' out of the water, and that's saying a lot.  The beat is so tight, so hard hitting, so in your face.  Zion is flawless, I mean flawless here and the whole breakdown at the end is just amazing.  This really is the definition of musical perfection to me.<br /><br />10) Forgotten vs. Frgt/10 (Alchemist Remix Feat. Chali 2na of Jurrassic 5)<br /><br />`Forgotten' has probably the most hard hitting chorus on all of `Hybrid Theory' so when I went into listening to `Frgt/10' I was expecting something completely different than what I received.  I'm ultimately thankful for that.  `Frgt/10' is one of the most thoughtfully conceived tracks on `Reanimation'.  Chali 2na is ingenious here, his vocals so provoking in their baritone.  The beat for the track is one of my favorites here.  When I spoke earlier of `In the End' and `Enth E Nd' being two different songs I meant that, but they have nothing on this track.  There is really nothing similar between `Forgotten' and `Frgt/10' except a few strategically placed lyrics.  Ultimately they created a flawless track here, so flawless that there's no way `Frgt/10' doesn't take this one.<br /><br />11)  Cure for the Itch vs. Kyur4 Th Ich (Chairman Hahn Remix)<br /><br />I remember when `Hybrid Theory' was first released my friends and I tried to come up with our own lyrics to fit `Cure for the Itch' and we'd battle each other in the car to see who could come up with the best stuff on the spot.  Then `Reanimation' was released and we decided to do the same thing for kicks.  For that very reason I'm giving this to `Kyur4 Th Ich' because it's just a little more fun to rap to.<br /><br />12) Pushing me Away vs. P5hng Me A*wy (Remixed By Mike Shinoda Feat. Stephen Richards of Taproot)<br /><br />I'm giving this to `Pushing me Away' simply because I loved this track from the first time I heard it.  Chester's vocals are spot on here.  I really was excited to hear `P5hng Me A*wy' but I was ultimately let down.  It's not a bad track, but the chorus is way too harsh.  I really expected them to capitalize on melody here, since the original was such a beautifully constructed track, but that's just not the case here.  That and I was left cold byStephen Richards addition to the track, it's just not that impressive.  It's sad, because it could have been brilliant.<br /><br />There are also some bonus tracks.  `My December' was one of those B-Sides that took off running thanks to ample radio play and a downright beautiful arrangement.  `My{Dsmbr' remixed by Mickey P. featuring Kelli Ali actually does it justice.  It's not as somber as the original but it doesn't lose any of its beauty.  I am not a fan of `High Voltage' and I can't really say that `H! Vltg3' really does much for me either, but at least the beat is memorable.  I'm not a huge fan of Pharoahe Monch but to each his own.  There's also a track here that's not even by Linkin Park.  `X-Ecutioner Style' featuring The Root's Black Thought is a killer track.  Black Though ignites beats provided by out of nowhere sensation The X-Ecutioner's.  Aside from these tracks there are three artists messages and then the beautiful opener that ultimately becomes the backlight for `Krwlng'.<br /><br />So, I'd say that `Reanimation' was a very smart move on Linkin Parks part.  Sadly they didn't take this route with `Meteora' (sorry but that mess with Jay-Z doesn't really count) and it's sad to say that their latest release `Minutes to Midnight' is less than impressive, much less.  This is where Linkin Park excelled, so here's to hoping one day they get back to where they started.ten' has probably the most hard hitting chorus on all of `Hybrid Theory' so when I went into listening to `Frgt/10' I was expecting something completely different than what I received.

There is really nothing similar between `Forgotten' and `Frgt/10' except a few strategically placed lyrics.  Ultimately they created a flawless track here, so flawless that there's no way `Frgt/10' doesn't take this one.    11)  Cure for the Itch vs. Kyur4 Th Ich (Chairman Hahn Remix)    I remember when `Hybrid Theory' was first released my friends and I tried to come up with our own lyrics to fit `Cure for the Itch' and we'd battle each other in the car to see who could come up with the best stuff on the spot.  Then `Reanimation' was released and we decided to do the same thing for kicks.  For that very reason I'm giving this to `Kyur4 Th Ich' because it's just a little more fun to rap to.      12) Pushing me Away vs. P5hng Me A*wy (Remixed By Mike Shinoda Feat. Stephen Richards of Taproot)    I'm giving this to `Pushing me Away' simply because I loved this track from the first time I heard it.  Chester's vocals are spot on here.  I really was excited to hear `P5hng Me A*wy' but I was ultimately let down.  It's not a bad track, but the chorus is way too harsh.  I really expected them to capitalize on melody here, since the original was such a beautifully constructed track, but that's just not the case here.  That and I was left cold by Stephen Richards addition to the track, it's just not that impressive.  It's sad, because it could have been brilliant.    There are also some bonus tracks.  `My December' was one of those B-Sides that took off running thanks to ample radio play and a downright beautiful arrangement.  `My{Dsmbr' remixed by Mickey P. featuring Kelli Ali actually does it justice.  It's not as somber as the original but it doesn't lose any of its beauty.  I am not a fan of `High Voltage' and I can't really say that `H! Vltg3' really does much for me either, but at least the beat is memorable.  I'm not a huge fan of Pharoahe Monch but to each his own.  There's also a track here that's not even by Linkin Park.  `X-Ecutioner Style' featuring The Root's Black Thought is a killer track.  Black Though ignites beats provided by out of nowhere sensation The X-Ecutioner's.  Aside from these tracks there are three artists messages and then the beautiful opener that ultimately becomes the backlight for `Krwlng'.    So, I'd say that `Reanimation' was a very smart move on Linkin Parks part.  Sadly they didn't take this route with `Meteora' (sorry but that mess with Jay-Z doesn't really count) and it's sad to say that their latest release `Minutes to Midnight' is less than impressive, much less.  This is where Linkin Park excelled, so here's to hoping one day they get back to where they started.
B00009MGGI|5.0|House of Cards is one of the finest productions of the British mystery series.  I purchased the DVD set because the program will probably not be shown again on television. Love every minute of it!
1594489505|5.0|I luckily stumbled across Khaled Hosseini's first book \\"The Kite Runner\\" and absolutely loved it. So, obviously when I saw this book, I bought it without a second thought. This is a great story of true love and a beautiful friendship. If you love a good book then this is a great choice!!
B000053VAF|4.0|I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan.  I love this movie, but I'd wouldn't recommend the Special Edition.  There isn't enough extras to warrant a $10 price increase.  Unless you're OBSESSED with Kevin Smith, I'd recommend the regular Dogma DVD.
0316010669|3.0|Gladwell laid out 3 objectives at the beginning of the book: (i) to convince the reader that \\"decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately\\"; (ii) to answer the question of when to trust our instincts vs. when to be wary of them; and (iii) to convince the reader that snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.     Point (i) was delivered brilliantly - a very pleasurable read. On point (ii), we got a very limited answer and only in the Afterword section - quite unsatisfying. On point (iii), Gladwell doesn't have an answer to the bigger question of HOW we can make educated and controlled snap judgments.     Perhaps there are simply no straight answers for (ii) and (iii), but the way the book was set up, one can't help but feel a bit let down at the end of it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To be honest, I never watched Firefly when it aired on TV. I really don't watch network TV. In my humble opinion, television programming is dead (there are some exceptions). The trash the networks spout out these days seems to be nothing more than crude, rude, mindless \\"entertainment\\" (again, there are a few exceptions).    A friend of mine recommended Firefly when it was first released on DVD. I was hesitant. I had tried other \\"popular\\" sci-fi shows on TV and I came away disappointed every time. I realize that many of these shows have a large fan base and I mean no disrespect to these people, but I just felt that these shows were garbage.    Well, I finally rented disc one of the Firefly DVD set. After watching the first disc, I immediately returned it and didn't bother renting the second one. I simply ordered the entire boxed set.    This is a thoughful, intelligent, entertaining, and character-driven show. The special effects are very good, the casting is superb, the dialougue is witty and intelligent, the stories are unique and fun, and even the costumes are brilliantly conceived!    I instantly fell in love with the crew of Serenity and eagerly looked forward to each episode.    This is a brilliant show!    So, what does that mean?    Well, the network executives will have to cancel it, of course!    Yes, the series did suffer from low ratings, but after doing a bit of research, I found out that the network insisted on airing the episodes out of order. This lead to viewers not fully understanding what was going on since they were not aware of some of the \\"back story\\" and previous events that had happened to the characters.    Well, that's a network executive all over; paid a rediculous salary to make really bad decisions for the general public. Where can I sign up for a job like that? (just kidding; I would never stoop so low).    The DVD sales of the Firefly series speak for themselves. Had this show really been given a chance, it would still be on the air today regularly pulling in a sizable portion of ratings and the executives I bad-mouthed a moment ago would be lining their pockets with oodles of cash.....BUT AT LEAST THE VIEWING PUBLIC WOULD BE HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    If you like sci-fi, PLEASE check this show out. You will NOT be disappointed. The show itself is great, but so are the extra features (the gag reel is HILARIOUS!).    If you LOVE sci-fi, just spend the money on the boxed set now and don't bother renting. You will thank me!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|All the bourne movies are really good.  Finally spy movies where spies get hurt and cars don't explode when they crash.  (Just like they don't explode in real life.)  Spy movies are just more rivetting when the action is situated in a reality that seems familiar.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Graduation is jump-started with the first track \\"Good Morning\\" (****.25) where he seemingly preaches to himself to wake up.  The beat is woven between synthesizers, repetitive base and snares, with harmonizing on the chorus.  As the song comes to a close 'Ye samples Jay-z's vocals from his Blueprint album, \\"The Ruler's Back.\\"  \\"Champion\\" (*****) is an inspiration track where Kanye spits some lyrics that tell tales of his past such as \\"My dad'll say, when you see clothes close your eyelids\\" but the best line in the song speaks about Lauren Hill \\"Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion, I wish her heart still was in rhyming.\\" This is easily one of the best tracks on the album.  Another 5 star track follows in \\"Stronger.\\"  The base beat followed by synthesizers is overlapped with a robotic vocal that continuously rambles throughout the verses and chorus.  The song puts me emotionally in the future and reminds me of the state I felt when I first listened to Deltron 3030, even though lyrically different, I feel that vibe somehow.  Throughout the song 'Ye delivers entertaining lyrics.  Followed by this track is \\"I Wonder\\" (*****) which begins slowly and softly with a piano and beautiful vocals.  After about 35 seconds base, synthesizers, a hard snare (I believe -- that is similar to \\"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\\"), and Kanye follow.  Kanye appears fairly aggressive on some parts of the song.  He asks several questions periodically throughout the track.  Overall, it is very pleasing to listen to.  Next I feel he falters with \\"Good Life\\" (**.5)with T-Pain (who tests my nerves).  Synthesizers are once again involved and some kind of chipmunk type vocals in the background.  This was obviously made to become a single, enlisting Pain is a clear indication of this.  It also appears to have been conceptually made to be on T.V.  \\"Can't Tell Me Nothin\\" (****) has a fairly different sound production-wise.  I believe it's either horns or synthesizers or strings with add-ins of Young Jeezy's ad-libs which I found very clever, even though on Jeezy's on songs I find them annoying, here they seem complementary.  The song just seems to be missing something that would push it further in my ratings, still it is a very good song.  However, at this point I must say that the album seems to lag a little.  I skip this song periodically because I have already heard it so much.  Along with being sandwiched between two other songs that I am not very fond for I usually make a quick transition from song 4-8.  \\"Barry Bonds\\" (**) follows by increasing my frustration.  Lyrically the song is fairly lackluster and both artists are at fault for this.  'Here's another hit Barry Bonds' is the only clever piece in the entire track.  Wayne annoys me in this song.  Ex. \\"I'm so ******* Good like I'm sleepin with Meagan\\" not impressed with the weak punchlines he uses in his verse.  Although he is usually a star behind the mic, here puts in little effort and as a result supplies no heat.  No one I know expected me to enjoy \\"Drunk N Hot Girls\\" (****) but I defied conventional wisdom (I guess).  The concept is pretty simple; Kanye & Mos are tired of drunk and hot girls and their antics, but the song is exceptionally original.  Mos does not rap here, he sings and if you have heard \\"Umi Said\\" then you know that he has a good voice; and yes I too was a little let down by the fact that he does not spit, but some Mos is better than no Mos.  The beat is hard to explain with synthesizers and strings, so I will move on.  \\"Flashing Lights\\" (****) is very pleasurable to the ear thanks to a beautiful beat that reminds me of something Timbaland has done in the past (ex \\"My Love\\").  Additionally, Dwele's neo-soul vocals are a treat, just as much as the beat is.  However, Kanye's lyrics are average and therefore I could not rate this higher than 4 stars.  Because of this the replay value is lower.  \\"Everything that I Am\\" (****) is another inspirational track where Kanye spits about who he is and what he has done.  All of his experiences (especially what he has heard form his haters) have made him who his is.  He seems to embrace his flaws, which is refreshing in the rap world of the incredibly over-conceited.  'Ye says, \\"Everything I'm not made me everything I am.\\"  The beat is slow in comparison to the rest of the album with a piano, harmonizing vocals on the chorus, and scratches by Primo.  \\"The Glory\\" (*****) begins with Kanye singing in fragmented sentences along with chip-munk vocals.  This is followed by a heavy base and violins.  This is a one of my favorite 'Ye tracks ever.  The lyrics are very good/entertaining.  Now \\"Homecoming\\" (****) with chorus vocals by Chris Martin.  The production consists of a piano and background crowd noises, of course base, and a tambourine.  Lyrically good.  Finally \\"Big Brother\\" (*****) the tribute song to Jay-z is very good conceptually and lyrically.  Kanye paints the story of his road to success which was aided greatly by Jay-z after being mentored by No ID (The main producer of Common's Resurrection album).  This is the only beat not produced by Kanye (it is prod. by DJ Toomp) and has more of a rock-rap beat that is very impressive.<br /><br />No, Kanye is not the most lyrical, technically sound rapper, but what he is, is refreshing, witty, and original.  Let me make this clearer.  Let's compare certain rappers to T.V. shows.  KRS-ONE would be the Evening News or 60 Minutes; Eminem would be something like South Park - often weird an unusual, but with a message that intellectual individuals grasp the meaning of.  Kanye would be the equivalent to Fresh Prince - Comedy which at times goes deeper.  \\"Jesus Walks\\" \\"Diamonds\\" & \\"Through the Wire\\" were all absolutely original, relevant, and amazing gems.  What I am saying is that it is foolish of those who discredit Kanye as an artist and give him 1 star for their own moral glory.<br /><br />Now, we can toss our collective caps in the air and rejoice over Graduation. 4.25 stars.t he has done.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Bought my DVD a couple of days ago and have played the heck out of it, but I haven't experienced the skipping problem others were having.  However, if you are a Gilmour/Floyd fan, quit reading the reviews and go buy it.  You won't be sorry.  Oh, and as they said below....just seeing them play Echoes alone is worth the price.  It's even great just seeing Rick Wright get into his playing a bit more than usual.<br />In summary....GO BUY IT!
0316166685|4.0|I really liked this book. It wasn't put together in a neat little package where everything ends up all hunky-dory after the family grieves together and then gets over it and moves on. That is so cliché. It shows a side of grief many of us don't know and hope we never have to experience once we do. The story starts out with a horrific, tragic event (the rape, murder and dismemberment of a young girl), but blossoms into a beautiful story of love and loss. Grief makes people do strange things, and this is demonstrated by the seemingly bizarre actions of Abigail, the mother. It is a raw and unedited look at how a terrible event can tear a family apart and change people for the worse as easily as it can bring them together and change them for the better. I was also amazed by Sebold's grasp of language - the way she so poetically describes events and objects is remarkable, even if at times it was a little too abstract, and I found myself a little confused. Recommended, but not for younger people.
B000RW3VD4|2.0|Be prepared for a disappointment, as this DVD doesn't include the \\"all new commentary from director Oliver Stone\\", merely reusing the one from the previous disc. The other additional features are great, but does not outweigh the disappointment, nor the fact that the title isn't really remastered that well from it's previous transfer.
0316067598|2.0|This could have been a much better book IMO. There was way too much \\" God bless Texas. I love my Commander in Chief. Lousy liberals tied our hands, and 84 pages about BUDS. I guess what I'm saying is, the editing could have been better, and don't blame your mistake on someone 8,000 miles away who would never know what happened if everyone kept their mouth shut. Given that I wasn't in the situation, I can't say for certain what I would have done, but I probably would have killed the three Afghanis to protect the lives of my comrades and myself. Also, less preaching about needing to do what it takes to win, and then not. P.S. I'm not a \\"liberal\\", and yes, I have served in the military, (88-92 USMC) so I can kind of relate.
B00026WU82|5.0|Someone mentioned that this is Dylan's first electric album.  I didn't realize that.  His acoustic albums seem pretty darn electric too.<br /><br />I like Dylan's long complex songs and this album has two of the best:  \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" and \\"Desolation Row.\\"  These songs are practically like novels in their depth.  I still get lost in them and marvel at Dylan's genius on each hearing.
B000002G85|5.0|Eric Clapton's self-titled solo debut is great, with a loose, bluesy feel reminiscent of Delaney & Bonnie and the first Allman Brothers Band album. Such songs as \\"Blues Power\\" and \\"Let It Rain\\" are undeniable, although \\"After Midnight\\" hasn't aged as well, probably because it's been overplayed. This is a CD that any Clapton fan must own.

This is how serious it gets for young idealists.<br /><br />At least the character in Dead Poets Society didn't go off to Alaska and starve to death in the woods!

B000001EEN|5.0|In 1973, Pete Townshend organized a comeback concert for his friend Eric Clapton at London's Rainbow Theatre after Clapton's long struggle with a heroin addiction. The result was a star-studded affair that was recorded for a live album, which originally contained only six songs. This reissue adds eight others and gives you the full experience of Slowhand's comeback. Of course, Clapton isn't the only one taking a turn in the spotlight here, as Steve Winwood has his turn on a version of \\"Pearly Queen.\\" This album has been unfairly criticized because the follow-up, 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD, was so great, but in my view, that criticism was unwarranted, because it shows that Clapton was still, despite his troubles, capable of putting on a great show.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|What a scary experience this is, seeing Dylan's life as practically single train of thought, from the early days all the way to an early peak in his career.  When you see what an elfin, vulnerable guy he really is it makes the story all the more amazing.  He was no more ready to stand up to the onslaught of criticism than any of us, but somehow he withstood it and came out stronger.  Dylan was a hero of mine before this; now even more so.<br /><br />Can Scorsese do no wrong?  Take a look at Last Waltz if you haven't already.  Dig Dylan in that snappy hat!
B000001FAW|5.0|I just love that album cover. I think it is their best of all their albums. They are not just standing there staring at the camara. They are in awe.This is a great follow-up to another great album, Main Couse. To think that this was only the beginning of what was about to come. This is their true, and in my opinion, only disco album in their career. A must own for any serious collector.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|Disappointed! This has to be the weakest of all Mark Knopfler albums.  I have all his albums and love them.  But this one does not possess the witty lyrical style like the others.  The tempo is so slow it becomes boring.  I liked the one song:  Punish The Monkey, which I believe posseses the Mark Knopfler song quality I am used to.  The songs sounded like leftovers from his previous albums.  I guess as artists age, they lose some creativity.  I compare this album to the latest weak efforts from aging artists like Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton. Nice songs but no edginess.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|[[ASIN:B000BEZQ0Y Pride & Prejudice]]  This music was beautiful and extremely evocative of the locations and ocasions occurring in the film. It has been composed to transport the listener to another time and place in the same way as Michael Nyman transported us in 'The Piano'. One questions the choice in the order of the music as presented in the CD not matching the order of the story line, however when listening, this dosen't matter at all.
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|i bought Stone Cold before seeing any of the other Jesse Stone series because i just love Tom Selleck. He is an awesome actor, and handsome to boot. This movie has a sex scene (albeit short) which seemed to have just been thrown in there. Why does Hollywood do this? I don't want sex scenes in movies i watch. It ruins an otherwise good story for me. I wish i could ask Tom, since he produced Stone Cold, why he put that scene in there. I would like him to know it detracts/distracts from, not enhances a good story. Someone tell him for me, please.

B0000TB01Y|4.0|I watched the Wicked last week in Boston. I loved the musical paying to be seated at the front row to see all the performances of the actors.    There are two things that I wanted to mention. It was like checking into a smart \\"boutique\\" hotel, the whole experience was. Then, after the show, I was puzzling if this was a masterpiece of the time?    The Musical can be explained as quite politically themed, still light-hearted, with tastefully depicted scenes, great singers, great costumes, well-balanced story line thtoughout the first and the second acts.     However, the biggest drawback is, there is no real drama(often too narrative conveniently explaining how ordinary Glinda could spell the magic after all, which  did not convince me) and, Alphi, walking away with the not-so-certain scarecrow Character, who fell for the animal activist, Alphi. And, all other characters were conveniently there to explain how the story unfolds(Alphi's sister, the captain, the green bottle, not so convincing)    Both Alphi and Glinda actresses were great singers, you will love their singing, but they hardly dance and act if  anyone noticed. Though Glinda was the joker of the musical, which was great-loved the character, it was rather thin-laid for the entire scale. Please, read further why.     And, the melody, sigh, was not the best for musicals. It is not catchy or heart-breaking(there is no such moment in the musical, btw).    That is why I am calling this musical, a perfected Boutique musical, better than most of new musicals you have seen in and out of Broadway or West End. But, it lacks great dance, grandeur, Great catchy melodies, no Climax.     I have watched 30-40 musicals so far. And, I can tell you that, The Who's Tommy, Phantom of the Opera, Billy Eliot, Miss Saigon, Beauty and the Beast, starlight Express were better than this one(strong Climax or catharsis, catchy melodies, Jokers, dramatic group scenes-either singing or dancing). I can still remember each scene by sceneand jewel songs from these musicals over decades.     The Wicked is close to, say, Chicago, the Hunchback of Notre dam, We will Rock You, Marry Poppins, Rent, Lion King.    But this is better than Mamma Mia, Les Miserables, Jerry Springer Show-musical.     In all, I wouldn't pay $150+ to watch the show but rather spend around $50-80 not to expect much like I did;).
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Great to see this series finally getting released on DVD.  For such a short run, My So-Called Life made an indelible imprint on American television.  Not only did the show introduce the lovely Claire Danes, but it vividly portrayed a teenage girl's attempt to cope with her family and school.  Not that what she had to endure was that traumatic, but it gave a rare glimpse into an adolescent's mind, rather than simply projecting adolescent fantasies onto the screen.  In many ways, the television show picked up where DeGrassi Junior High left off, an excellent production on PBS that ran between 1987-91.  Whereas DeGrassi was an ensemble cast, My So-Called Life firmly revolved around Angela Chase, but unfortunately was left pretty much in the lurch when ABC chose to cancel it before it had even had a chance to complete one season.  Maybe the booklet will fill viewers in on some of the details surrounding the show's untimely demise.
B000002URV|5.0|This is the best of all Enigma's CDs.  Would absolutely love to see them perform in concert!  This particular CD is a must to be played when you are with that VERY SPECIAL someone, and for those very intimate times.  It is moving, sensual, and utterly draws you into it, which makes the intimate experience unlike anything ever felt before.  What I am saying is that this CD enhances the feelings already there!!!  Absolutely unbelievable!!!!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I don't get it. If anybody else made a movie this long about nothing, it would be destroyed by everyone. Russel tries to save this. He is able to do it in the shorter version. In this one...no chance.     I miss the original. By the way the graineyness (not sure if that's a word) blows...yet another thing that worked much better in the movie theater.    Release the original release in it's entirety. I will give it 5 stars and actually buy it. Its a shame Planet Terror wasn't released first. I fear this one will turn just about everybody on the fence about seeing away.    Lastly, its almost sarcastic to include a second disc.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I remember seeing this back in 2005 when I rented the Criterion edition and watched it one night. I loved it so much that I went to buy it and it was out of print! The only DVD at the time was the bare-bones MGM DVD, which had good picture and sound, but no special features, which is COMPLETELY unnaceptable. I did not buy it, and I stand by my decision, because I saw this steelbook 20th Anniversary Edition at HMV the other day, which I bought. I stand by my decision to buy this DVD!<br /><br />This should be the PERMANENT DVD of this classic movie. I am glad I own it, it's the best DVD in my house right now. Disc one has the theatrical cut, and disc two has the uncut version, which is what the Criterion had... except this is better. This one makes it hard to figure what is restored, leaving you to watch the theatrical to find out what was cut. The special features are great, worthy of the price. Great featurettes, and the commentary is damn cool.<br /><br />Finally, this is the DVD that gives Robocop the treatment it deserves. Those who ae hoping to own this classic gem on DVD in it's true and uncut form, buy it now!

The writing was clever, and the idea of a Stephen Hawking tape connoisseur, imaginative.

This novel illustrates what can happen when one child's actions set in motion a chain of events that will momentously change the lives of many of those around her.  The changes are not for the better.  Many people suffer and the nature of the suffering differs between them, as does its duration.      Thirteen year old Briony is the catalyst for the life-changing events that happen in 1935 at her family's country house in England.  In part one of the book I vacillated between understanding Briony's behaviour and wanting to castigate her for her willfulness.  In the following parts we move forward in time and see the repercussions of Briony's actions and how her regret and guilt grows into a need for forgiveness, and a determination lasting reparation for her offense.  The novel  finishes in 1999 with devastating revelations.       McEwan's characterization and evocation of the various eras that the story spans are wonderful.  The story has a powerful impact because of the  care taken in its writing; believable characters & plotting and vivid period details. It makes you pause to reflect on how your actions today may bring grief for many years to come. It also shows how distance in time from one's actions doesn't necessarily assuage guilt, it may compound it with heightened empathy for those wronged.  It is a gripping story and a definite must-read.

0440241413|1.0|As I have lately been enjoying the chick lit genre, I decided to give this book a try.  It sounded silly, but I figured if Kinsella was able to follow it up with several more Shopaholic books, she must be on to something.  I finished this book 2 weeks ago, and I'm still trying to figure out why, exactly, this book is such a hit.  I found Becky very hard to relate to.  Yes, like many 20something women, I've had credit card issues.  But Becky's pathological lying to her family, friends, and herself, wasn't amusing.  There were so many times in this book where I realized that a situation was supposed to be funny, but it instead just made me a little bit sick to my stomach.  I would have greatly enjoyed the fairy tale ending had it happened to any other character, but I couldn't root for Becky.  She didn't deserve it.
B000PY52EU|2.0|I found Black Snake Moan to be raunchy and boring.  The plot never developed like I thought it would and the ending kinda left me hanging.  Great acting by the cast but the story had no point, I got tired of Ricci running around in those dirty white underwear, and the whole chaining her up thing was dumb and pointless.  Sorry but this one is not worth the money.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|If your a doors fan buy this 2007 remastered album. Cause the remaster job is the best job yet on any album, I got 500+ CD's now. And I have the doors LP's and the older CD's to. But I can really hear the difference here, really, not like all my other remastered CD's. Also you get more artwork then in previous copies including the LP and I get printed lyrics to. It's like a little book with a story about the doors that I can read while I listen to the CD kicked back in my easy chair. I was so exhilarated I bought all 6 new CD's. And they all are the same remaster job, perfect. They all should learn a lesson from this remastering. So I give this a perfect score for the material and the remastering. I figured you already knew the bonus tracks are a bonus to.    Amazon is the way to buy. I get the CD with the Artwork of some album you can't find anywhere around town for starters. I download it on my computer, make a copy for my MP3 player, make a copy for the car and put this copy in my collection for my house system. All at a competitive price.

0307237699|5.0|Regardless of their political affiliations, it's hard to find a person who doesn't think Barack Obama isn't a decent guy. He never tries to oversell himself and doesn't claim to know everything. He's also very down to Earth and isn't afraid to admit when he's made mistakes. All of these qualities have made Obama a successful politician who may be rewarded with the ultimate prize in November 2008.<br /><br />However, in addition to being a good politician, Obama also happens to be an excellent writer. I was very impressed with his first book, \\"Dreams from My Father,\\" which is more of an autobiography than this book is. In \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" Obama explores some of the major issues facing Americans today. He does devote a chapter to politics, but also focuses on foreign policy, education, the economy, and family values. Obama peppers his chapters with personal experiences, pieces of American history, and an examination of the current state of affairs. He doesn't offer detailed, step-by-step solutions to these problems, admitting that he doesn't have all the answers. Instead, Obama presents his ideas logically, passionately, and sincerely. He has a very laid-back writing style that is very similar to the way he presents himself when speaking in public. Most importantly, he's very realistic. Obama addresses both sides of each issue and explains his views in a way that's very easy to understand and also illustrates that the senator has a lot of good common sense: something that many of his Washington counterparts are severely lacking.<br /><br />I'm sure Obama must have at least been considering the idea of a presidential bid when he wrote this book, but \\"Audacity\\" isn't just a political text. It's a book about all the things that make America great, and it generates a sense of hope that things have the potential to get a heck of a lot better around here. That alone is enough of a reason to read this inspirational book written by a passionate man who was born to be a leader.

Anyway, in regards to Seconds Out...if any of you are old enough to remember...Genesis was considered one of the top \\"live\\" bands to see at this time...sound, visuals (they pretty much invented the laser show!)....the complete package.

B000UJ24SC|5.0|the black dahlia murder...  what can be said about such a great band?  they're brutal, they're gross, they don't take themselves seriously, they own.  upon first listening to the new record it definately sounds like them.  they haven't changed their formula at all.  it's all speed and brutality all the time, and while that isn't a bad thing i was hoping for progression.  don't get me wrong, i highly enjoy the new record but it sounds like their previous releases...  are they playing it safe and just sticking to what has been working for them in the past?  get this record if you liked unhallowed and miasma.  get this record if you've never heard of this band but want brutal melodic death metal.
B000002L99|4.0|Well, I decided that I couldn't fairly review Van Halen's first Sammy Hagar album without discussing, concurrently, the highly competitive DLR solo release of the same year, Eat Em & Smile. Roth left Van Halen on really bad terms...and the feud between he and Edward continues to this day, despite the impending reunion. So back in late 1985, early 1986, there were no words minced between the divided camps.    I mention Dave's album here for a couple reasons. For one, he took nearly all of Van Halen's crew with him...not to mention Van Halen's only producer to that point, Ted Templeman. Beyond that, the VH brothers were already varying their sound, having added more and more keyboards to their songs...a point not lost on Roth, who always fought that notion. Adding Sammy changed the vocals, the lyrical approach, and ultimately the overall feel of the songs. Generally gone now were the little dialogues in the songs, though that did pop up a couple times on 5150 and in its stead was a smoother voiced, higher ranged Hagar...depending more on vocal prowess than charisma and vocal atmosphere.     Dave took the opposite approach and went at his album in old VH fashion...with Diamond Dave's soulfulness, humor, and propensity to tackle the oddest cover tunes with flare. Not to mention Roth recruited hot guitar virtuoso Steve Vai, who, while not Edward, wasn't shabby either. While their styles weren't exactly the same, by any stretch, they were cut from the same experimental and exciting cloth. Add to that Eddie's bass playing equivalent in the lightning-fingered Billy Sheehan, and there is no doubt that DLR had assembled a very serious solo act.    So how do they compare?    Dave put out a great album, no doubt. Yankee Rose would've made an incredible Van Halen tune to follow up the 10 million selling (yikes!!) 1984. To the novice ear, one might even think that it was a new Van Halen tune it's that close (and that good). Dave simply changed players and still pulled out songs with the same color and flavor. The rest of the album never quite gets back up to the quality level of this smashing opening number, but the record is filled with great moments, including the soulful Ladies' Nite In Buffalo and the also very VH-esque, Goin' Crazy...which sounds like it could've snuggled up next to Hot For Teacher on 1984. Goin' Crazy was a fun little rocker that just oozed humor and catchiness. Throughout this record, like many VH releases, DLR reminds you of why he's the biggest goof in the rock business and wins you over because most of his songs are so damn catchy and infused with good times you feel guilty for both taping your foot and thinking, \\"Why do I like this?\\"     Not unlike the much-criticized Diver Down LP, Eat Em And Smile is full of cover tunes and like all things Dave, he finds his niche and makes them all work. Shyboy comes from Sheehan's former band and fits nicely with the sound, featuring some blistering work on bass and guitar. It's probably the musical moment on the album. Other covers like the Sinatra classic, That's Life and the wonderfully charming I'm Easy just reek with Roth's style and propensity to tackle his influences, no matter how much contrast he manages to muster. Tobacco Road is another fine little tune, as is the quasi-rap (!!) laden Big Trouble, which I admit is a personal guilty pleasure of mine.    The only place where this album lets down are on slightly disappointing Elephant Gun and the ridiculously unoriginal and trite Bump And Grind, which even Dave's charm can't elevate out of mediocrity.     Van Halen's first epic with Sammy Hagar is equally successful at bringing the fun to the party. (And you have to ask yourself in hindsight, were there two more enjoyable rock records in 1986 than 5150 and Eat Em & Smile, with perhaps the notable exception of Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet?). In fact, I think 5150 is a hair more so. Van Halen, while it had the band name and Eddie's guitar legacy going for it, faced a larger challenge. Roth was such a dynamic and unforgettable influence (even if you hated him) that replacing him with ANYONE was a daunting task. It was sure to change the dynamic of the band and sure enough, Hagar did. That being said, the atmosphere was not diminished even where it was modified.     I mean, let's be honest, Van Halen was \\"changing\\" whether Dave was leaving or not. Most of the songs for 5150 had already been (musically) penned and while the lyrics and vocal melodies surely would've been markedly different than they turned out to be, the keyboard-laden Why Can't This Be Love would've still been Why Can't This Be Love. I think that fans sometimes overlook this and lay too much blame at the feet of Hagar for the \\"differences\\" that came between the 1984 and 5150 releases. Hagar was blamed for a natural musical evolution that was already taking place.    All that being said, 5150, which I've listened to twice in the past 24 hours, is a great album. I'll start with the negative and say that the only filler piece, and it is just that, is the album closer Inside. Even still, it's a fun song...albeit pointless and most critically, overlong. But the rest of the CD is just filled with awesome tunes.     Amongst my favorites is Summer Nights, which is probably my all-time favorite Sammy tune (ok, top 3-5 anyhow) and would contend with many great Roth tunes in my mind. The riff (a paired picking of a series of notes on a headless Steinberger guitar) defines capturing a mood with a riff, which, when coupled with Hagar's lyrics, evoke an inescapable and palpable vibe of summertime. (See Feels So Good and Take Me Back for other occasions of lyrics and riff matching up perfectly in the Hagar era). The chorus is infectious.     Another is Dreams, which may be Sammy's pinnacle in the band, a soaring number, both musically and vocally. Van Halen fans had never heard a song like this with the band's name on it because Roth never could've churned out such power and melody. That's not a knock on DLR, but Hagar is indisputably the better singer, even if he's a step down in the charisma department.    A few of the more rousing numbers include the album opener, Good Enough...(well hellllloooo Sammy), the groove of Best Of Both Worlds (perhaps the best song on the album), and the downright irrefutable Get Up, which is a ball of energy from the start, an On Fire for the Sammy generation of VH fans, if you will. The dueling dynamic between Hagar and background vocalist Anthony is in Technicolor display in this rockin' little number.     5150 has its softer moments, like the previously mentioned Dreams...to which you can add to that arguably the best power ballad Van Halen has ever penned in Love Walks In (in my top 5 VH choruses of all time and a great ending solo) and the first Hagar single, Why Can't This Be Love...which is good but the weakest of the three in my opinion, but still quite good.    The album's unsung hero and forgotten gem is the title track 5150. If you've let this one slide from memory, please revisit it soon. It is perhaps the finest example of Edward on this record as well as most effective song structuring.    5150 marked a major change for the band and one I don't think they quite lived up to at the same level again. But to ignore the spirit, vibe and musical abilities on display here simply because you like Roth better is a pretty dismissive and just plain ignorant. I give 5150 4.5 stars of 5 (A -) and consider it a contender with the best of any VH albums.    Dave, on the other hand, excelled at what he did best...just being Dave. This was his post 1984 pinnacle as well, with each subsequent release losing a little bit more each go `round. But for a moment in 1986, DLR proved he could leave Van Halen and still not only put out a great record, but build a band that for a year or two, was able to stand in the center of the rock ring and trade blows with the mightly Van Halen. I give Eat Em and Smile a very strong 4-stars of 5 (B +).    In many ways, it was a win-win for fans of VH and DLR alike. At least it was for this particular fan.
B00007KWHG|2.0|After seeing Jersey Boys in Los Angeles I remembered how much I loved \\"Sherry\\" when it first came out, and I was just a kid at the time. In fact, there's never been a song that excited me as much as \\"Sherry\\". Watching the play I loved the Four Season's music, but if you want to buy one of their CD's with all their great songs I would advise \\"Back to the Diner, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons\\" over \\"Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons\\". I ordered \\"Very Best---\\" because it had December,1963 (Oh, What a Night), which was a delightful number in Jersey Boys, but the version on the CD is too disco, and too 1970's. In fact, a few of the later songs on the CD do have a disco sound. So, \\"Very Best---\\" has all their big hits, but if you have an opportunity to buy \\"Back to the Diner, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons\\" I'd recommend that over \\"Very Best----\\".
B000002LPD|4.0|Ok, here's where I contradict myself and say I mind it less when Sammy Hagar gets smarmy with his innuendo. In fact, it works here...though to just read the lyrics I wouldn't think so. For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ranks probably 2nd or 3rd even behind 5150 and Balance in so far as Hagar albums. In fact, it's probably stronger from start to finish, meaning it's more consistent, than Balance...BUT Balance has a Sammy tone I like more. (Serious stuff like Seventh Seal, Feelin,' etc.). But Carnal almost perfectly \\"balances\\" (guffaw) the lighter and headier Hagar stuff and that's a great plus.    What doesn't work for me here, upon recent re-listens, is In `N' Out...which I think is pretty extraneous stuff. Adds nothing to the album on any real appreciable level. Even still it's not awful...just not terribly memorable. Man On A Mission (with its obnoxious falsetto backgrounds) also qualifies as filler here.     Songs that might other wise qualify as bad on just their titles alone, songs like Spanked, Poundcake, and Pleasure Dome (big, collective \\"oh my\\"), actually excel with a robust and interesting musical freshness . Spanked has this really awesome 8-string bass riff that's hard for me to deny, even if the lyrics are dumber than dirt. And the latter is just so odd that it scores really high on originality for me, from the frantic intro to the deepened vocal take in the verse. Poundcake is the best of the lot and clearly the exception to the \\"Sammy writes awful sex songs\\" observations I've made over the years. I don't know what to say about it beyond that, except that the tune is very memorable, quite catchy, and I'm not drowning in Hagar's cheeky uncleverness like I am when listening to a clunker like Up For Breakfast.    Songs like Top Of The World, Right Now, and Dream Is Over are just really well-written, fun, melodic pop-rock tunes (with just enough heavy edge) that require no apologies. In fact, Dream Is Over falls onto a short list of most sadly-forgotten/dismissed Van Hagar tunes.     316, while a bit repetitive, is still sweet and sincere. A tribute to Van Halen's future bassist, as it turns out. (Sure to make the senior Van Halen openly weep on stage when he plays it). Not his best solo stuff, by far....but hardly his worst.    Judgment Day is the best song on the record and probably a top 5 Sam Halen tune ever. And it's even better live, one of the few real highlights on the VH live record. The searing Anthony background vox are chill-inducing. Strong lyrics here too. Great energy. Wonderful drive.    Carnal sort of shakes off the funk and identity uncertainty of OU812 and heavies up a bit from the Van Hagar debut of 5150. I remember thinking at the time of its release that it was the heaviest of the Hagar lot thus far, and I still think that's an accurate account. It's not quite as heavy as Balance would turn out to be, but it's a bit more fun too. It's sort of...(wait for it)...the best of both worlds, in so far as Van Hagar tonalites go.     It's also a great sounding record, as one would expect with the return of long-time producer Ted Templeman. It's probably the best sounding of the four Hagar albums.    I don't like it quite as well as 5150 and the great stuff isn't quite as strong as my favorites from Balance, but this record rocks...no doubt. The DLR-only crowd laughs and blows more snot bubbles in their collective nostrils, but the Sam heads get what was good about this record. So I'm speaking to YOU.    A fairly solid 4-stars of 5. (B)

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Ok, buckle down. You think I gush on this band otherwise, it's nothing like this. Quite honestly, I have a personal favorite Van Halen record and this isn't the one. BUT it's difficult for me to argue against this being their best album. (There is a distinct difference between best and favorite ya know).    There's not a weak track on this sizzling debut album from 1978. You'll hear people extol the relative mediocrity of \\"lesser\\" tracks like Feel Your Love Tonight or Little Dreamer.....but they'd be wrong. Well, wrong to me at least.    By now this record has been spun in every possible way on rock radio and not unlike Zep IV, you don't even need to own this CD to be intimately familiar with it from first groove til the last. However, as far as hits go, it's generally known for the following staples: Running With The Devil, a heavy tune with one of the most memorable opening drone of car horns ever...! (Of all the famous car horn openings, of course). Eruption is the solo that set the music world on its ear and nearly single-handedly redefined the approach to guitar for 10 years. That's no small feat and furthermore, it's no exaggeration either. The solo encompasses many of Edward's various and - at the time - revolutionary guitar techniques in a cacophony of melodic virtuosity and almost fx-level \\"noise.\\" It's a wonderful marriage! Beyond that, it's sheer discovery, not unlike Thomas Edison. Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love is another regular and one of the few that managed to be a semi standard even in the Roth-less eras of the band. The cover of the Kinks' You Really Got Me was the lead off single and the first of many tunes by other artists that VH made their own. Jamie's Cryin' was another that ultimately found its way, via sampling, into a hip-hop hit by Tone Loc called Wild Thing.    And had those been all, it's already an album's worth of great tunes. But like the old Ginzu Knife commercials used to say, \\"But wait!! There's more.\\"    There definitely is.    All thegreat albums have them, those gems that don't get near the spotlight but you defend them for that reason...and sort of take a liking to them beyond their relative brilliance in a protective, self-defensive sort of way. Like you actually wrote them. Ha!    In that category fall the above mentioned Little Dreamer, which very well may be the most rudely ignored song of the entire DLR run. It's melodic and smooth....yet still sexy as heck, with a wonderful solo that never breaks the tempo or vibe of the song. Feel Your Love Tonight is the more rocking equivalent of Dreamer, a true pop-rock gem with an infectious guitar groove and tight choral harmonies...and a blistering rock and roll solo, the spirit of which resurfaces in a future tune like Hot For Teacher. The folksy-turned-rockin' Ice Cream Man is cover number two, and another complete reinvention by the band...showing off both Ed's complete mastery of the six-string and getting a good dose of David Lee Roth's spoken vocal style. Again, it's a marriage of old school roots and contemporary fire-slingin.'     I'm The One, Atomic Punk, and On Fire simply blister and belt. I can't really even rank them or lay much of a claim to which works better because they all do.     This album is a tsunami of energy and raw sound....perfectly blended with candy harmonies for color and texture. I think the most beautiful thing about Van Halen is that they're a package of everything you're feeling. They're street rage and humor. They're like a hornet's sting and a lover's touch. They'll both burn you alive and and lower you down into a cool, calm pool of tranquility. And brother, no other record illustrates that range like Van Halen I.    Usually when one gushes, \\"There are no weak tracks here\\" what one often ends up meaning is, yeah, there are a couple throwaways...but there's so much good, that's ok. But in my book, every song on here is very strong. They all have a sense of distinctness and personality...and yet they all blend nicely through common threads like the aforementioned harmonies and trademark DLR yelps and hollers. That and Eddie Van Halen, as screwed up as the guy may be, was unleashed on a public that outside the Whiskey, Gazzari's, and a few other places in and around southern California, didn't know he existed. Or what was in store for them.    That can never been expunged or reduced.    Van Halen I is a 5-star album of 5 and my top pick for the greatest Amercian hard rock album ever. Yeah, it's that good. And it's aged so well. It didn't sound 70s then and it doesn't sound 70s or 80s now really. In the years that would follow, VH would tie themselves more to trends and sonic road signs that indicated place and time. Not here.
0966638328|5.0|This book is a beautiful, beautifully put together quick reference to color! The illustrations, to-the-point text, and the resource of pallets makes it a great starting point or cheat-sheet to using color on designs for the concious mind. It has helped me greatly on basic projects like page layout, websites, and application design. This is a must have quick reference for anyone who cares about color harmony and psychological impact or stimuli of self or one's project/product on one's audience and needs on the fly application of the same. I highly recommended.
B000002LEM|3.0|Overall I'd say that the sophomore Sam Halen album is probably my least favorite of the bunch from start to finish, inclusive of all six DLR and four SH records. However that's with all things being relative. There's only one VH album I can honestly say \\"I DISLIKE\\" and fortunately this isn't it.<br /><br />OU812, a semi-clever retort to the DLR-titled Eat Em & Smile, a jab at his former bandmates, is probably the most mellow of all the Sam or Dave-led Van Halen albums. The musical diversity is pretty wide. The lyrics, however, are generally unclever and overtly sexual. Not that that bothers me at all, normally (I am a Kiss fan)...except the lyrics are so Goddamn dumb and boneheaded at times, they border on embarrassing. I much prefer when Hagar is writing about just about any other topic....(see Humans Being, Seventh Seal, Don't Tell Me, etc. Part of why I like Balance so much...). And he's really at his best when he's crooning about driving around and partying, because really, Van Halen is America's coolest party band. On that note, let's jump right into what works well on OU812.<br /><br />Feels So Good is, in many ways, very un-VH. Hardly a guitar to be heard and led by this bubbly, organ-esque keyboard riff. BUT what this song thrives on is an inescapable and wholly palpable vibe of summer. Atmosphere means a lot to me. I could buy a Slayer ballad and a death metal tune from Nelson if it simply feels right. So \\"wimpy\\" or not, Feels So Good is a nearly perfect song. It's very much in that Summer Nights (5150) and Take Me Back (Balance) vein...and it's just very cool. You are instantly wherever it is Sammy is talking about. Can't give it a higher compliment than \\"it takes me there.\\"<br /><br />To a large degree Cabo Wabo does the same for me. I'm a bit torn these days because it sounds like one big commercial NOW...but at the time and to no fault of the song, it works for the same reason the above mentioned tunes do. Only now do I feel a tinge of shameless self-promotion...and beyond that, I'm freakin' TIRED of everything Sammy does anymore having some variations of \\"cabo\\" or \\"wabo\\" (Waboritas...? WTF?? STOP!!!). But again, no fault of an otherwise good song.<br /><br />Perhaps the best tune on the record is the opening Mine All Mine, which just zips and rocks right along. A bit of a darker tune with an infectious keyboard groove to start it off.<br /><br />Yet another big time keeper is Finish What You Started, which while borderline grossly cheeky in the lyric department, is made up for with some really spiffy flippin' work from Edwardo. The music is very much in that same style of a Take Your Whiskey Home....sort of that \\"written on the front porch\\" type feel. (And actually, it was!! The tune was written in the middle of the night on Sammy's porch after Ed came over, unable to sleep after coming up with a riff). So another tune high on vibe.<br /><br />Another song I like is the obligitory Van Hagar ballad. Yes, it's drippy stuff, but When It's Love...in all its contrivance...is still an effective and well-penned and performed radio magnet.<br /><br />I'm iffy on A.F.U. (Naturally Wired) and I simply loathe the title. But nothing offensive here. I feel the same about Source Of Infection, but again...cringe at the title and the lyrics. Musically it's pretty good and I love the chorus , which harken back to the album before with it's Get Up-ness and cooley high harmonies.<br /><br />The weakness of this record was the lead-off single, part of the final three sorry songs on the album. Until now we've had an effective mixture of sexy smarm, cool atmosphere, and musical variety. But we end with a lackluster and, frankly, way out of place blues cover of old Little Feat tune Apolitical Blues, the cringeworthy and almost entirely-woeful Black & Blue (sorry...just never took to this song, even from the first listen), and my least favorite song on the record, Sucker In A 3 Piece. The latter has almost no redeemable qualities to me,even musically...which is odd because even when the lyrics kill a VH song for me, the music is usually there. And this is a meandering, riffless, unmemorable mess.<br /><br />Overall there's probably not any more problems here than on Balance....and by my count, actually a song or so less, although that album's problems were as much couple short instrumentals rather than full songs. I suppose I'm just disappointed that the final three songs on a record with a lot of promise delivers lame fizzle.<br /><br />Overall even 3-4 \\"meh\\" tunes still don't take away from the good moments. What OU812 lacks in overall energy...sacrificing their usual blister pace for * (takes a toke) * a more laid back vibe...it still makes up for in places with some effective atmosphere. The lyrics are dumber than dirt at times and quite frankly, that aspect of the album brings it down more than it ought to.<br /><br />I'm somewhere between a 3 and a 3.5 of 5 stars. I'd say C to C (+)a VH song for me, the music is usually there. And this is a meandering, riffless, unmemorable mess.

B000I5YCCO|5.0|This is a great album. \\"All killers, no fillers\\". If you enjoy Taylor's Tim McGraw & Teardrops on My Guitar, I can say without hesitation and with my hand on my heart that you'll love the rest of the album.
0679746323|1.0|The newest tome of bathroom entertainment. \\"Entertainment\\" is what this is. you know when movies are \\"based on true events\\"? this book is like that. I don't blame the authors for trying to make a couple of dollars by sensationalize and distort history to their liking. no one can really say their version of history is 100% accurate, but this is almost cartoonish in nature. I just hope some poor person don't actually believes any of this non-sense.     So read this book for fun, but please don't take it seriously, and god forbid please do not bring anything up from this in a discussion with your friends or family who are knowledgeable in Chinese history. You will be laughed right out of the room.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Franka Potente is quite hot and such a good actress. Her story in this film is so powerful and believeable. As long as you don't mind subtitles (which I don't). The soundtrack is also amazing and should be checked out as well. Enjoy!
B000002AQQ|5.0|great soundtrack! It is a baby boomers slice of heaven. All you need to do is put on an oversized pair of headphones, crank it up or light it up and sit back and give it a listen. It's like a trip on the magic bus to our days of rebellion when we thought we could change the world through our music. Well, the world has changed, albeit all not for the better and the music stands the test of time.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|What a CD !! And I LOVE the fact that it's very different from Back to Bedlam; darker, but very haunting and alluring; very, very impressive. And for all those who think James sings with a girly voice, eat your heart out. In this CD he's very diverse with his range. Listening to James and his band is much like finding that \\"perfect\\" author... no matter what he/she writes, you could never find anything wrong with it. I consider myself fortunate to have found both, James Frey and James Blunt. Kudos to James and his band for delivering a perfect blend of vocals and instruments that make you want to listen to it again and again. I saw James in Montreal last Spring which was nothing short of fabulous and hope to catch him again on his upcoming tour.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|George C. Scott as Gen. George Patton creates one of the most memorable characterizations in screen history. A driven, complicated warrior is so formidable that every time I read books where Patton is mentioned I see Georce C. Scott's face as Patton. An indelible role of a larger then life hero. This is no glossed over version on his life but all the warts and faults of the man are shown and you still walk away eternally grateful that our nation had such a great General when we needed him the most. This movie in no way glorifies war it is almost anti-war movie showing the confusion and horror of war. How any list of the greatest films in film history can exclude this masterpiece from it's list is beyond me. I consider it one of the 25 greatest films ever, maybe Top Ten material. I'd watch this a hundred times before Citizen Kane. The opening scene where Patton is addressing troops in front of gigantic American flag is the stuff of cinema legend.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I own the original DVD but I had to buy this one, it just looked so cool. I listened to the commentary with Joss and the cast (very funny) and watched all the extras. Most of the extras are on the original DVD but the new bonus features are really good. Totally worth it!
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Overall a pretty decent film with Gerard Butler completely suited for the role.  The person who seemed out of place was Sarah Polley, somewhat inauthentic as the witch Selma.  Scenery while harsh and drab is still quite beautiful, and the actor who plays the troll, I thought, did the best acting.      Don't expect high octane action.  This is meant to have followed along the tones of the Old English poem set in Scandanavia.  Pleasant to watch but a little slow going.
0767903854|5.0|This is a great book, in my opinion. Bryson makes this tale both informative and funny. I had at least a few laugh-out-loud moments with this book. After I finished, I felt almost as if I had just taken a trip to Australia (never been there yet)- def the sign of a good writer. If you've never read Bill Bryson before, take a chance on this one - you won't regret it.

B000UX6THK|5.0|Just like many others,I bought season 2,what...4 or 5 months ago?!I'm mad about that,the fact that my season 1 dvds have a glitch from the factory,that my season 2s are supposedly decent quality but came in cheap-styled packaging,and the fact that i figured this set had to be a rumor if it was coming so fast after season 2.I still haven't opened my season 2,so I can maybe sell it off to some unsuspecting Lynch fan for about as much as I paid for it,but I'm not gonna rip anyone off--so I guess I'm the one who gets the slap for this one.I'll get this set,but it had better be \\"good as gold\\" with ZERO factory defects,and pristine packaging!!!With that said,I'd have both feet in heaven if I hadn't bought the first two seasons seperatly.Err....thanks CBS and Lynch....I guess.
0385486804|5.0|I found the story quite interesting.  True, he could have planned better and was intelligent enough to have found the right information to better outfit himself had he chosen to but that is not how he chose to complete his \\"odyssey.\\" A part of me thinks he wanted to suffer and suffer he did.  It was his life to live as he chooses and while unfortunate others are affected by his death, it was his life.  It amazes me though how he deeply touched all the other's lives.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, the story does bounce around and the stories of the other explorers took me off track but overall it was a story worth reading and I enjoyed it.
0375831002|5.0|I loved this book! The story is narrarated by a rather witty \\"angel of death\\", which in and of itself gives the story an interesting spin.  The characters are wonderful, expressing a full gamit of personalities and underlying motivations. It was also very interesting to read a World War II story from a German perspective, yet still have a story which doesn't diminish the horrific Jewish experience.  And as heart wrenching as the story was, you are left with a sense of hope that makes you want to go out and do something to change the world.
B00018D44U|4.0|A great CD featuring Jones' wonderful voice.  Her back-up band is a little mundane in my opinion, but Jones is superb anyway.
B0000012YO|5.0|I have several complete recordings of these sonatas including Barenboim (wonderful), Brendel (masterful) and Kempff (classic performances). Emil Gilels, whom I heard play in NY many years ago, produces a sublime interpretation with startling majesty and insight. I would not trade off the others, but I certainly place this recording first. How sad that he died at 69 and before completing this cycle.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Never knew much about Elizabeth and just judging by the portraits of her that I saw on my tour through London, I thought of her as some boring, dry queen with no motives behind anything but self glorification. Thanks to this film, Elizabeth is revealed to me in a whole different way. She's a girl with a broken heart, a survival, a murceful queen, honest and devoted to England! I was quiet amazed by  Cate Blanchett's performance. In every movement she made, in every word she spoke, she was as believable as could possibly ever be. The story of Elizabeth's life and her battle against evil within her country as well as from out of borders of England lays out so beautifully by Cate's performance as well as the writers and directors that it was hard to take eyes off of the screen. A history, a legend, and a mystery of the queen Elezabeth won over my heart as I watched the movie. I wish I could write more, but it's hard to put in words something that comes in your life unexpactedly and amazes you with its richness of wonder and fantastic beauty! I recommand this movie for any lover of powerful movies that have mystery, love, darkness, beauty and magic of destiny mixed all together! Go watch it fast before the sequal comes out this fall 2007, ELIZABETH: The Golden Age!

B000J10EQU|1.0|1st. Toss the kid  2nd. If you going to have Lex Luthor as a villian make him have some common sense.  Why would you want to build a huge island in the middle of the ocean when he had access to knoweledge of the universe.  He was to campy to funny not sinister enough.  A few episodes of Justice League Unlimited had plot lines more developed than this.  If you watch Justice League or Smallville there is nothing funny about Lex in those versions.   3rd. I want to see Superman fight someone on his level .... Doomsday, Darkseid, Mongul, or Impereix ( Reason why Marvel is slaugthering DC in sales and movie production is that their characters actually fight villains on their level and its action packed and has emotion)  4th. This is 2007 not 1978.  I love Christopher Reeve and he was awesome for his time but Bryan singer made a mistake making his movie close to Richard Donner.  Audiences of 2007 want something more raw nothing watered down.  Superman saving a plane, being shot with a gattling gun and lifting a huge mountatin into space was all the action in the film which is sad for all that money they spent.   5th. Let Micheal Bay direct a Superman and Doomsday grudge match on film and I guarantee a blockbuster.  Look how innovative Transformers was and it only cost 150 million compared 275 million for Superman Returns.  I hope Bryan Singer doesn't direct the sequel.
B00011F5DK|4.0|If you skip over 5-star praising reviews, you'll find from the 4-star ones that you really need all 4 people to enjoy this game. With 2 or 3 players, the end of the game is always like this: player 1 wins, players 2 and 3 end up with one piece each that they can lay down if you let them finish the last round. You can call it a tie or you can call it \\"1st player wins\\", either way this is not a lot of fun.    Don't get upset though. There is a way to make it fun for 2 and 3 players. The creators didn't think hard enough; but you can easily mod the board, and all you need is a thin permanent marker (like Sharpie).    The general idea is to reduce the number of squares on the board so that players would run out of board space before they run out of pieces on hand.    So you take a marker, and you draw a line one square away from each of the four edges so that the 20x20 board becomes an 18x18 board. This is your 3-player board. When in 3-player, players are not allowed to place their pieces in the 1-square frame you just drew.    For 2 players, make another frame, this time 1 square away from the already reduced 3-player board. So you end up with a 16x16 board that is perfect for 2-player. Believe it or not, you can still get a tie on this board, but very rarely, and both players need to be quite creative and need some luck to get to a tie.    Another 2-player variation is that each player plays for 2 of the 4 colors (for example, player 1 for green and red, and player 2 for yellow and blue). Players still take turns and lay down one piece at a time, but you choose which of the 2 colors to play with when it's your turn. This 2x2 game is quite hard. Every time I play this variation it makes me feel my brain is about to explode (because there are too many choices and you only have one turn at a time!). I recommend trying this variation when both players already have enough experience with the regular game.
B000T2PRF2|4.0|Great live-in-studio stuff --- plus a couple of vids --- and a couple of live cuts.  \\"Temptation\\" is tremendous.    (Anybody else's DVD have audio static in it during \\"Temptation\\"...?)

B000IMUYJM|5.0|I do like some horror films--like \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and \\"The Stepford Wives\\"--nothing too bloody and gory.  And the original 1974 \\"Black Christmas\\" (directed--surprisingly enough--by Bob \\"A Christmas Story\\" Clark) is not that bloody and gory.  But it is effectively creepy--and very entertaining.<br /><br />A brief synopsis: A psychotic intruder decides to live in the attic of a sorority house during the holiday season and begins to kill people right and left.  That's it.  Pretty simple plot.  But it's so well-executed by the director, writer and especially the wonderful cast.<br /><br />Margot Kidder (before she became Superman's Lois Lane) stars as the alcoholic foul-mouthed sorority sister--and she's a hoot and a half.  Andrea Martin (who would later gain fame on \\"SCTV\\" and is currently starring in the new Mel Brooks' musical of \\"Young Frankenstein\\") is the intelligent, voice of reason sister.  And the lovely Olivia Hussey plays the heroine who has a troubled personal life.  Keir Dullea, John Saxon and a hilarious Marian Waldman (as the house mother) also give great performances.  I just Googled Ms. Waldman because I was curious to see what else she starred in.  It seems most of her career was on the stage in Canada--and her nickname was \\"Pookie\\"--and she sadly passed away in 1985.  But I would recommend this film just for her performance--she's that good.  A terrific comic performance, which one wouldn't expect from a film called \\"Black Christmas\\".<br /><br />It's funny.  However, I didn't care for the ending when I first saw it years ago.  I won't give it away but I found it unsatisfying--and disturbing.  But having just watched the film again last night and listened to the new interviews with Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder, I now appreciate the ending--and I think it's perfect--but still disturbing.  And speaking of the interviews, this Special Edition DVD is great.  There's also an all-new documentary on the film and a midnight screening Q&A session with director Bob Clark and actor John Saxon.  All of these extras are quite interesting--and add to the overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />So if you're in the mood for a creepy but very amusing little film, check out the original \\"Black Christmas\\".  It's widely acknowledged as the first modern slasher film--four years before the original \\"Halloween\\" came out--but it's not too bloody and gory for those of us who just prefer our horror flicks to be scary--with a bit of dark humor thrown in to the mix.  I think you might be surprised at how good this film is.  I know I was--and that's why I've given it 5 stars.  I know it doesn't rank up there with Altman's \\"Nashville\\" or Allen's \\"Annie Hall\\" or even the wonderful \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", but in the genre of horror, \\"Black Christmas\\" deserves its 5 stars.John Saxon.

B00009V7P8|4.0|This is the first cd of Damien Rice that I have ever listened to and I really liked it.  I could do without a couple of songs that try to be too edgy, but when Rice sticks to the folk rock that he does best, it's well worth the investment.  The hidden tracks are among my favorites.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I purchased this movie as a birthday gift to myself a few months ago, mistakenly thinking I was getting the American Civil War mini-series, and was terribly disappointed to realize my mistake.<br /><br />This past Monday I finally got around to watching it, and have watched it for hours every day since then.  Every special feature, director's commentary, cast bio's, everything.  I think I've seen it all the way through four times in less than a week!  I haven't been this taken with a movie since Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth over a decade ago.<br /><br />North and South drew me in from the first scene onward, and didn't let me go.  I'm glad I didn't read the book first (though I am NOW),  if it would have ruined anything about this movie for me.  I'm in love with Richard Armitage, Brendan Coyle and the whole rest of the cast.  The directors deserve all the kudos in the world for this beautifully rendered classic.<br /><br />I've never been more grateful for making a mistake in my life!  I'll still buy the OTHER \\"North and South\\" miniseries, but this one is destined to be my favorite always.

She only had one previous DVD with a half-hour of music, which I felt wasn't worth the purchase , but this was a bargain considering one also gets two CDs.    Anyway, the main thing is the concert and how it looks on DVD....and I have no complaints. This is \\"first class\\" all the way.  The setting is beautiful, the muscians are talented and Loreena's voice sounds as beautiful as ever.  I enjoyed listening to her speak briefy before most of the songs.  She has a very soothing presence and this DVD concert is just the ticket if you want to spend a really mellow, enjoyable evening of outstanding music.    I've played this three times in the two weeks I''ve owned it, and it gets better every time!

B00005JPRF|1.0|I really dug the first Resident Evil for its tight plot and superior set design. Apocolypse was more average thanks in large part to the movie's clumsy handling of the Nemesis monster.  Now comes Extinction, possibly the last and definitely the least in the series.      Extinction takes place several years after the 2nd. The T-virus has turned the Earth into Planet Zombie and there are scattered tribes of humans trying to survive by any means they can. One group, led by Ali Larter from Heroes, and including a couple of characters from Apocolypse, meet up with Alice (Milla Jovovich) who has isolated herself from human contact because of the scary new powers she obtained from the Umbrella Corporation. The company, which has survived the holocaust by going underground, has been searching for her to continue it's experiments. Which of course begs the question; if there is no one left on Earth, why bother? And how will they continue experimenting? What with humanity being wiped out and all.  But you know big corporations, always in it to make a buck, even if there are no economies left. Anyway, once they find her they unleash a group of zombies to try to kill her friends. This leads to the inevitable showdown between Alice & Dr. Isaacs who has turned into some kind of monster after being infected with an advance strain of the T-virus.      I can't fault the director for trying to film RE:E in a different fashion from the first two movies (broad daylight instead of night) but Extinction doesn't contain a a shred of suspence and by using P.O.V. shots some of the action is filmed so up close you can't tell what's happenening. Like the caravan in the desert, Extinction wanders aimlessly looking for ...something...anything.     But the movie does accomplish something. Like every other flick Jovovich does, it somehow manages to get her out of her clothes. I can't believe I'm writing this but I'm getting sick of seeing her naked. It just goes to show you just how far Resident Evil has fallen.
B0001CNRBG|3.0|Like Gene Hackman, Ellen Burstyn is one of those actors whose outward normalcy and everywoman demeanor make her deceptively versatile acting skills resonate even more. Still one of our most respected actresses, she had quite a run of quality leading roles in the 1970's, and this time-spanning 1978 comedy was one of the few purely romantic parts she played. That's because she became enough of a box office draw to be able to repeat her Broadway role here unlike 1987's [[ASIN:B00003CX8N 84 Charing Cross Road]] which Anne Bancroft essayed in her place. Burstyn is paired here with Alan Alda, then riding high from the long-running [[ASIN:B000HT3P5Q M*A*S*H]] series, playing a couple, Doris and George, happily married to other spouses with six children between them. They meet by chance at a Mendocino B&B during a weekend in 1951, and the movie tracks the affair that develops between them once a year in the same inn over the next quarter-century. Picking up on their illicit activities every five to six years, their trysts become statements of their times and also of their evolving marriages.<br /><br />The movie is a deliberately contrived set-up made up almost entirely of dialogue between the two principals and patched together by familiar, Life Magazine photo images of the intervening years. Bernard Slade adapted his own hit play for the screen, and some of the stagebound strain shows in the interplay. Director Robert Mulligan, who made [[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird]] and [[ASIN:B000MX7XZ0 Love with the Proper Stranger]] in the early 1960's, shows a sure hand with the actors, but there is little of cinematic interest here. Already well into her forties, Burstyn is still convincing in showing the evolution from a naïve 24-year-old Oakland housewife to a fifty-year old retiree with aplomb. It's the direct sincerity of her characterization and the minor changes in voice and manner she employs to show Doris' growing maturity. Even though the camera belies her years early on, it's still a masterful turn. Saddled with the more contrived and exaggerated lines, Alda is less impressive as George relying more on his recognizable Hawkeye mannerisms except in the most dramatic episode set during the Vietnam War years. The postcard-perfect Mendocino setting and treacly Marvin Hamlisch music supplement the aura of romanticism necessary for this type of confection. The 2004 DVD has no extras.on, it's still a masterful turn.

B000002H4Q|4.0|The Cure is one of the rare few bands that has been around for twenty some years and not look or sound like some outdated dinosaur like every hair metal band who are trying to resurrect their sagging careers in recent years. One of my all time favorite albums is by The Cure (i.e DISINTEGRATION). I am finally getting around to check out the band's other albums, prior and after DISINTEGRATION.<br /><br />KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is my first foray into the band's past. Having loved PORNOGRAPHY, DISINTREGATION, and BLOODFLOWERS so much, it was a bit hard for me to letting go of the band's dark, atmospheric sounds on those albums but I eventually did. KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is am unforgettable mix of post punk, pop, and hints of goth. The version I have is the original recording so the production value is awful. I like how diverse KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is from the post-punk sounds of the opening track \\"The Kiss\\" to the Middle Eastern-tinged \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\". My only other quibble with the cd is that it is a little long for my tastes. Songs like \\"The Snakepit\\" (one of my least favorite tracks) could have been edited down to three and a half minutes as opposed to over six minutes of incessant droning. For all its minor flaws, KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is still a great piece of work by one of the greatest bands ever to walk the face of the earth...The Cure.  This album is definitely worth checking out for new fans of The Cure.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|I bought their comeback cd a couple of months ago and has been listening to it at least once a day.  This cd has a permanent cd slot in my car.  Can't say there's one song that I don't like.  Patience is my favorite.  Too bad this cd does not get any airplay time in any U.S. radio stations (tried requesting a song once but unfortunately the station does not have this cd).  Well... hopefully, things will change once their song \\"Rule The World\\" gets nominated at the Oscars. The special edition cd has an extra song called \\"Butterfly\\" - which was sang wonderfully by Gary Barlow (a very talented songwriter in my opinion)

My older sons loved the original Disney movie on video, and this DVD is being watched with the greatest delight by my younger children! With good reason! Even though this is an extremely long movie by present standards, it moves right along, is packed with fantastic, classic songs, amusing scenes, and even touching, poignant parts which will move you, zinging straight to your heart.<br />Julie Andrews, who rightfully won an Oscar for her role as the magical nanny who appears at \\"just the right moment\\" at the door of the discombobulated British Banks' family's household, teaches the children and their parents as well a thing or two about how to live properly. It's complicated to say what \\"living properly\\" means, exactly, unless you watch the movie...It has much to do with having fun as you do things you ought to be doing. It has to do with caring for other people's feelings, and also for taking a day off when you are least expecting to and having a fantastic adventure! The songs \\"Spoonful of Sugar\\", \\" Let's Go Fly a Kite\\", \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\", \\"Feed the Birds,\\" and Chim-Chimminee\\" are all so famous and so beloved it is quit easy to call up their tunes at a moment's notice, I expect.  If you haven't heard them lately, I suggest you get a copy of this really well done 40th anniversary edition and relive the first time, or times, you saw this movie. It is touching, and charming. Dick Van Dyke is fantastic as the appealing foil to Julie Andrews' character. You can tell Mary Poppins  adores him in his character (Bert, the chimney sweep) but must maintain her ladylike character -- it is truly sweet. Another charming and superbly played  part is that of Ed Wynn's in the scene which includes the song \\"I Love to Laugh\\". That is a great scene in every way! Incredible!<br /><br />The children and their family are beautifully cast; the ups and downs are believable, and easily coax you into caring about the plot. The movie is extremely well rounded. There is dancing, singing, and fantasy galore.  I cannot recommend this 40th anniversay version of Mary Poppins highly enough. I don't care how old you are! You will love this movie!s and downs are believable, and easily coax you into caring about the plot. The movie is extremely well rounded. There is dancing, singing, and fantasy galore.

0440213525|5.0|If one was to go merely by the reviews online this book would have been overlooked.  This book has everything a 'good book' should have. The book opens up with Mark, a 11 year old boy who is in the woods smoking with his younger brother, Rick.  They see a black car pull up and watch in suspense as a man attempts to committ suicide.  You have to get this book to find out the whole story.  I loved it from the beginning to the end!  I most definitely will be reading more books by him.    Highly recommend!
B000JJSRNY|4.0|Outstanding quality. Domingo still in great voice at 65. His young companions share a youthful chemistry [ one suspects that there may have been something stronger than coffee available in the rest room! ]  The audience were clearly caught up in the atmosphere  One slight criticism - a bit too much camera movement made one a little giddy at times. As an 82 year old male,I found Ms. Trebenko disturbingly   captivating ! Ah, memories !!
0465043577|3.0|(Mis)Behavior of Markets is a wonderful book for people looking to understand why modern financial modelling does not adequately explain real market prices and their fluctuations. The authors are quite good at pointing out the shortcomings of current models that can be easily verified by the reader with web access. They also give a decent overview of how an alternate mathematical view shows promise in improving our understand of market volatility. I took away from it that markets are far more chaotic than we currently appreciate (their view) and short-term investors will suffer the costs of this (my view).    There are two points where the book falls short. While it makes generous use of graphs to explain mathematical relationships, it could stand a fair bit more formalism in explaining the math. This isn't supposed to be an academic treatise, to be sure, but the informality made it hard for a skeptic to follow every logical step in the reasoning.     The book may be light on math but it sure isn't light on self-esteem. The author (I'm assuming these parts are chiefly written by Mandelbrot) feels the need to end most of his paragraphs with a reminder of how his contemporaries have underappreciated his groundbreaking research. I'm sure he's smart dude but I kind of assumed that whe
B000VZUWZW|5.0|A bit awkward, pretentious (in a good way :) and totally funny. I am not sure about the girl but the chemistry between two main characters was great. Jokes were right on and timing was perfect. I hope this one makes it to the finish line.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's self-titled cd is perfect to listen to after a tiring day to help you relax or if you are in the mood for a little smooth jazz. The first four tracks of her cd are my favorites and overall I greatly enjoy this first debut by Corinne Bailey Rae, however I must admit that after Track number 5 \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" I find that all the rest sound pretty much all the same. The beats all seem to run together and there is no distinction between them.  But overall, it is a really good cd and I hope to hear more from this talented singer, but I hope that on her next cd maybe she'll spice it up a bit more. So based on this I can only give this cd three stars.
B000E1ZK50|5.0|The story line is good on this title as well as the fact that how can you not love something about vampires and the good ole werewolves. Van Helsing is a great movie and was even better for an HD-DVD release. I found it to be one of the better titles released for HD-DVD so far. I just can't wait to see what comes out in the future.<br /><br />I've always hoped that they would do another Van Helsing movie but I doubt they will.
0060931736|5.0|This is art. There is not one unnecessary word in this novel.  Miss Brodie is a mystery throughout the story and you just go on pondering about the characters long after it is finished.     And, you: Watch the film starring Maggie Smith, too. It's absolutely a masterpiece.
B000I2JKCO|5.0|The quality of the movie was just great for a HD-DVD title. I was pleased to be able to watch it in HD. The movie hoes have its little quirks but the overall content was just superior to most other titles geared towards the Christmas stories. It wasn't all that long which is great for kids as it's hard to keep them watching and interested for too long. Tom Hanks does seem a little harsh at times in the film and almost a tad mean but he played the role quite well. I and my family was rather pleased with this movie.
0375842209|5.0|I can't remember the last time a book has had as much of an emotional impact on me as this one. I actually cried as I read it--and I don't know if I've ever cried over a book before. I also sped through the whole thing--over 500 pages--in less than 24 hours. I had to keep shooing away my husband and kids so I could finish reading it. The writing is luminous, the characters are unforgettable and have great depth, and the themes are as important as themes can get. The narrator, Death, is often sly and sarcastic, sometimes bitter, but never mean.    This book may be marketed at the \\"young adult\\" market, but \\"old adults\\" will like it just as much.
B00005JPRF|3.0|I enjoyed the other two films in this series to some extent, and I even liked this one quite a bit, but the dialogue and lack of plot were beyond bad. Milla was hot and fun to watch as always, but everyone else I could care less about. The storyline didn't really progress much and it looks like the fourth film in the series will be on its way in a couple of years. Not bad, but worth waiting to rent on DVD.
B000RJO578|5.0|Ever since \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Spaced\\", I've been a fan of Simon Pegg and his crew, but this was a new high. This movie is full of so many laughs that, when my wife and I saw it in the theater, we fell out of our seats often; this is a must see for anyone who loves cop movies and good comedies; you get two-for-one, by the power of GRAYSKULL!

B000RZIGUY|5.0|When it comes down to action movies, a lot of them are impressive visually and filled with cool set pieces yet a lot of them seem to be emotionally inert. It's as if they write the action scenes first and then decide to just connect them with the flimsiest of plots and barely any character development at all - or at least poorly-handled development anyway. One of the few successful ones at combining drama and action is Face/Off, directed by John Woo who did Mission:Impossible 2 but is mainly known for doing A Better Tomorrow and Hard Boiled. It's a cool insight in taking on personas we don't want to do but the freedom they can allow.<br /><br />FBI Agent Sean Archer has been on a long hunt for Castor Troy, a known terrorist who's responsible for accidentally kiling Sean's son Michael in a failed assassination attempt. Well after successfully capturing Troy and his brother Pollux but leaving Castor in a coma, Sean receives grim news: a bomb is hidden somewhere in Los Angeles and is set to go off soon so Sean decides to go through an odd procedure: borrow Castor's face through advanced surgery and get the location of the bomb from Pollux in prison. But things don't go as planned as, even though he gets the location, the real Castor awakes, sans face, and takes Sean's. Now both are dealing with new people and the problems or the advantages they can create and both have to figure out how to kill the other and get their faces and lives back.<br /><br />John Woo has been known recently for being an almost easier-accepted version of Michael Bay. Both make action movies yet don't really have the dramatic impact of anything. Of course Woo has done A Better Tomorrow, the Killer and Hard Boiled so he's got that going for him but Face/Off is probably his best Hollywood movie. Not only is it visually exciting but also has great character moments and interesting ideas. How would we react if we were supposed to react in a certain way because of the environment and the people around us? Both characters find it's not easy to just slip into a new life so comfortably.<br /><br />But it would all fall apart if it didn't have strong actors and luckily we have John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who manage to both play twisted and psychotic for one character yet sympathetic and caring for another yet not feel disjointed when they switch places. The supporting cast also includes Gina Gershon and Alessandro Nivola on Castor's side and Joan Allen and Dominique Swain on Sean's end,  even James Denton (Mike from TV's \\"Desperate Housewives\\" and comedienne Margaret Cho turn up).<br /><br />Even though it does have some \\"Woo-isms\\", namely flying doves, highly-kinetic action and characters' puzzling tendency to flip and jump when in gunfights and could've done with some trimming, it's still a fun and even touching action movie.cters find it's not easy to just slip into a new life so comfortably.

B00005JPRF|1.0|As I watched Resident Evil: Exctinction, I casually kept a mental list of all the much better movies that this one ripped off.  In no particular order: The Road Warrior, The Birds, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, 28 Days, The Matrix (well this one was bad too), X-Men, and any variation on the Frankenstein template.  And that's just off the top of my head.<br /><br />I recall how, in the early RE games, the dialogue was odd and confusing, because the characters would move random body parts while they spoke poorly written lines.  For example, you might encounter an NPC who says \\"We have to find Whesker!\\" while she flails her arms about. Ironically, this movie is not much better.<br /><br />For the record, it's the future, virally infected man-eating zombies are everywhere, and the few remaining uninfected humans are trying to contact each other without getting turned into zombies themselves.  There's a lot of driving around in the desert (actually Mexico) while the attractive, perfectly made-up girls pout through a dusty windshield.  Oh, and they all have guns.<br /><br />Remember how in Team America: World Police, the writers made fun of the plot device that kills off a character if he/she is pursuing a love interest?  Well, that happens here too, but these writers want you to take it seriously.<br /><br />Even if you accept such derivative and cliched premises as entertainment, you have to endure all kinds of illogical action and plot developments.  For example, why wouldn't you cover your face with your hands if you're being pecked to death by a flock of man-eating zombie birds?  Answer: the CGI guy hadn't thought of that.  Or consider this: how are you going to access gasoline pumps in a city that is under at least 10 feet of sand because it has been reclaimed by the desert?  Would you even be able to pump the gas without an operating credit/debit network?  Answer: stop thinking so hard!  You'll bother the texting teenager in the next row.  Best of all: how does a helicopter get from Las Vegas to Alaska on one tank of fuel?  Assuming that the average person can even fly one?<br /><br />Movies based on video games are still just bad.  Whether this is because of the low expectations studios have for the average gamer's level of intelligence, or the low expectations that the average gamer has for movies in general, remains to be seen.Alaska on one tank of fuel?

B000G73UEU|5.0|The soundtrack is an invaluable companion to the DVD of the same name.  Now you can have Mr. Cohen's fabulous songs, performed by the same talented musicians as the DVD, to keep you company anywhere you are. The words are from deep down and amazingly meaningful.  Some are funny, and some are heart wrenching.  All are glorious.
0446310786|5.0|Anyone who gives this book a chance will absolutely love it! It starts out with childhood memories of Scout Finch that seem to be completely unrelated, but Harper Lee cleverly weaves them together to make a great novel. The novel's point of view is unique and is probably what makes this book a classic. The story is seen through the innocent eyes of a six year old, but is being retold by an older, more mature woman. This allows the novel to have more mature  language and ideas, but everything is seen through an innocent child's eyes. It's the best of both worlds, and I promise you, you'll be in tears by the end. It's a heart wrenching novel, and though it may sound repetitive, you'll love this book if you read it!
B0002BO0HG|5.0|If you want to hear the voice of an Angel here on Earth, all you have to do is listen to any of Antony's CD's.  The man has a vocal range to match no other.  His character is not for everyone, as he is a very unique individual.<br /><br />However, that voice will stay with you forever........
0061001783|5.0|I adored the hero and heroine of this book.  Cotillion is very complexly woven, great for cuddling up and escaping from the world.  The humor is more subtle, but it is brilliant.  I believe Cole Porter would have loved this book, as would Oscar Wilde.  Another Heyer triumph.  This one just amazes with its cleverness.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|One of the best I have seen lately. What a wonderful heartwarming movie, I will definitely watch this again. The movie focuses on who protects the targeted couple and the consequences.
0743289412|5.0|My own husband and I share little words or phrases of our own that made this book hit close to home at times.  King's writing style was challenging to me and made me feel like an accomplished reader for \\"getting\\" the story.  It was beautiful.  I was laughing during certain parts and I'd flip the page and be crying.  The connection between Scott and Lisey literally leaps off the pages.  I especially loved the way Amanda's and Lisey's relationship bloomed throughout the book.  Mr. King, you did get \\"the sister thing\\" correct.  Great job!  It was a wonderful read.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|This is not a greatest hits package. This is not a studio album. This is a cd of two unedited performances....and it is brilliant. Morrison drunk without a net and wavering between goddamn genius and drunk stupidity. These performances do a great job of showcasing Morrison's sense of humor and his abilities as a frontman. This is not Jim Morrison-the Lizard King, it is Morrison-the Changeling and the crowd is with him the whole time. The first show even has its moments despite the fact that Morrison doesn't even bother to sing the lyrics to Five to One, instead using his rap from their cover of Gloria. The second show is awesome and when listened to as a singular concert experience it is even more powerful. I like the Detroit Show, but it 's too safe, this album represents all the different facets of Morrison's personality and his soul: the charming poet, shy schoolboy, redneck, exhibitionist, lovable rogue, class clown and drunk. I find it funny that people love Morrison for his words and his insight, but they can't deal with the reality of what shaped his vision and altered his perception. It's kinda like saying...\\"William S. Burroughs is a great writer and I love his books, but I saw him at a reading and he was strung out on heroin.\\" DUH...
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Every once in a while does a movie come around that utterly leaves you mesmerized.  Donnie Darko, the best movie of a recent year, is one of those films.    Donnie Darko is a fine film.  One of the most interesting and original films in a long time.  It's quite worth a watch, time after time.    The DVD features two commentaries, deleted scenes, a few feauturettes, and plenty of other \\"goodies\\".    Highly recommended.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|You have to be a fan, but if you are, this is the movie you have waited for. The video is crystal clear, colors bright, and all the special effects are just as hoakie as you would expect. The sound is also outstanding, but don't expect much beyond stereo. All in all, a great B movie for the kid in us.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Well, I honestly can't remember just where or from whom I first heard of Kamelot. It was a divine calling that I should pick up this CD. I just had a feeling about this one. I couldn't wait to get it. Epica was worth every second of the wait. From beginning to end it's solid and consuming. Sadly a rare event in modern metal. Kamelot are miles ahead of other \\"Power\\" metal bands. In fact their something totally of their own creation. It's less a swords and sorcery album than an emotional epic set within a fantasy backdrop. I'd put it up there with Operation: Mindcrime by Queensryche as far as concept albums go and that's saying something! In short, Epica a surperior album by an amazing band. You can't live without this one. Go ahead. Get it. NOW!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one of the absolute best prematurely canceled shows. This show proves yet once again that TV execs have no idea of what a good thing is. This show based on fan support alone should have been kept on the air, maybe re-aired on another station who knows. I mean who doesn't enjoy misfits triumphing against adversary and gettin the short end of the stick, along with some good laughs, in deep space? In the lexicon of space adventures this one I give 5 out of 5 stars.

B000SNUMCU|5.0|J.Koo summed up the album better than I could.  I have been into these Finnish symphonic metallers for a while, but only became hardcore with \\"Once\\", which literally blew me away.  A onetime friend in Minneapolis sent me a mixtape of her fave Nightwish moments a while back, and she was into ethereal and exotic pop like Delerium, so at first, before hearing Nightwish's music, I thought they'd be the same way, and Nightwish had a similar type of name.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I had no idea at first they were a symphonic, operatic metal band, just that they had an operatic female singer...Tarja...but the band had me intrigued, so I bought \\"Once\\", saw it was on Roadrunner in the US and thought hmmmm...well, it was the only release on Roadrunner I loved, haha!!!  It was a mixture of everything I loved and things I didn't expect to hear...the ethereal and the orchestral and the metal mixed together extremely well with amazingly-written Scandinavian pop melodies of the highest order, within suitelike structures.<br /><br />\\"Once\\" could be one of the top albums of the decade.<br /><br />Then I read they fired Tarja after much drama with her husband (partly, she didn't want to tour the US cuz of the small venues they'd be playing), and I was a tad worried about their future, but also highly curious of who their new female singer would be.  I did see 6 months ago they were booked into NYC's awesome, fairly new Nokia Theater in Times Square, like OOOOO, Nighwish are coming!!!!!!  So I knew they hired a new singer and a new album would be forthcoming.  I also saw the newly released \\"End Of An Era\\" CD/DVD, which was cool, and the recent, awesome \\"hits\\" collection \\"Highest Hopes\\" 2CD/DVD, but what about the new album, and what label would it be released on, Nuclear Blast or Roadrunner???<br /><br />Cue up the brand-spanking new \\"Dark Passion Play\\", woohoo!!!!!  I was browsing my fave NYC record store, and there it was, a promo copy on Roadrunner!!!  Not a plain advance but a regular copy with full artwork and a hole in the barcode, so I held it like a precious gem, looking it over, looking at photos, and there she was, new singer Anette Olzon...my first thought???  She looks just like excellent country singer Martina McBride!!!!  So she can't be all bad.<br /><br />Well, I popped it on, with no preconceived notions, and I was, again, blown away.  No, Anette is not Tarja...and like J.Koo said, this is a good thing...her style is more accessible and pop, like Frida and Agnetha from ABBA or even the onetime singer from Swedish powerpopsters Lambretta, BUT Anette adds a nice dose of emotion into her singing which elevates her above most pop singers, and she has more of a rockish approach and warmth that Tarja never had.<br /><br />Anette and this album could be the key to gain Nightwish an American audience, and she blends better into the band than Tarja did, so that weird space between singer and band that hindered Nighwish is long gone, thank goodness...Ville Valo from HIM once stated that this distance rendered them fakes...he can't say that anymore!!!<br /><br />Now, the songs...WOAH, what a rush!!!!  The 3 singles, \\"Eva\\", \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and the gorgeous \\"Amaranth\\" just kill me, and the richness of Anette's voice almost made me cry.  But the epic 14-minute opener \\"The Poet And The Pendulum\\" deserves a medal of some sort...it really shows Nighwish are back, they mean business and all detractors who miss Tarja can fall by the wayside and join Tarja's camp for all they care.  I'm with the band, and I am ready for their US tour (possibly their first full one ever, if I'm not mistaken)...<br /><br />\\"Once\\" took things as far as they could with Tarja...\\"Dark Passion Play\\" somehow takes this to the next level, with full symphony orchestra, choir and boy soprano...supposedly, it's Finland's most expensive album ever made, and it definitely shows...BUT DPP doesn't act all arrogant about it...the cost is well spent in the songs and elaborate(the understatement of the year) arrangements, charts, treating the songs/pieces with respect, love and care they deserve.<br /><br />This could be the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" of 2007 releases...and I'm not joking...a serious contender for album of the year, bar none.s/pieces with respect, love and care they deserve.

B00005B36H|5.0|It took me a few times to get this album in due to how accomplished it was, but this is by far the best work Tool has ever done. Tool took their sound that you heard in Undertow and AEnima and brought more spirituality to it. the complex drum rolls to the dark, heavy guitar riffs make this album better. If you like Tool and have their first two albums, I would highly recommend this one. If you've never heard Tool, or just heard the songs on the radio, and are curious, I think this is the best one to start on, for the simple fact, it is the hardest one to swallow. Once you've listened to it though, you cannot stop. It is an amazing and beautiful album that shows their true brilliance.
0393061310|5.0|One of the most important books of our time; it single-handedly wipes out every justification for racism, and gets to the roots of why humans groups are where they are presently.  An amazing synthesis of disciplines into one very readable explanation of how it came to pass that Europeans happened to be the ones that colonized the rest of the planet instead of some other group.  The most clear example I've ever seen of why archaeology, and all the social sciences are not only important but vital to modern people.  The better our understanding of the past the more likely we are to be able to let go of the emotionality that keeps us at each other's throats.  A modern \\"just so\\" story.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|This TV series is excellent as many reviewers will tell you.  I have the \\"silver box\\" set of all seven seasons, so I was curious what this new set had that was different.  Per my review of the details at [...] the only differences are: (1)the new green slimmer packaging for the 7 seasons, and (2)one more disk (#49) with new features.  All the other disks #1-48 are the same as the \\"silver\\" boxes---ie. all the episodes and all the same extra features for each season.  This new set is still fullscreen and has the same audio options.  It is not HD as some may have hoped.  Therefore, if you already have the 7 seasons, at least for me, it makes no sense to buy this set just to get one extra disk!
B00001QEG5|4.0|This is, in my opinion, the best Twisted Sister album and I was delighted to find it for sale on Amazon.  I've not had a copy for over 10 years and it still rocks my world today.  This album is full of good, honest 80's rockin' fun and it's great for singing along.  The riffs get stuck in your head all day.  If you're new to Twisted Sister I recommend this for a first album.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B000LC51TM|5.0|This is definitely the CD/DVD combo Rammstein fans have waited for! The live CD is excellent...great selection of songs from all of the albums, excellent production, & HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY! The DVD is also WAY BETTER than their first DVD from a few years ago. All of what I stated previously applies here, but also the camera shots, stage setting, costumes, lighting, and just the energy from the band & the crowd are much better this time around as well! Get this Rammstein fans, it is AWESOME!
B000FQJAIW|4.0|The second disc of traditionally throwaway \\"bonus features\\", in this case is the ORIGINAL theatrical release of \\"Star Wars\\" (and NOT \\"A New Hope\\"), and is the sole reason for anyone to buy this DVD.  So incredibly superior to the \\"Special Edition\\", the same care and attention should have been made to this material as the main feature.    From the opening crawl on, I was brought right back to 1977 again.  CG effects have no place in this film.

No words can express the appreciation that true American have for you and the service men and women that allow the rest of us to be free Americans.      The book is amazing.  I read it all within 24 hours.  There was nothing more that I wanted to do then follow the Seals through their courageous journey.  I was captivated from the start.  Those that imply that the beginning is slow have a short attention span.  They watch too many MTV video.  Do they think D-Day was panned in a day?    This book brought me to tears.  This is the second book in ten years.  The first was \\"Into Thin Air.\\"      Anyone that can read this book and walk away with support for the liberal media clearly lacks the appreciation for true American heroes.  Those that feel we should subject ourselves to additional terrorist attacks by supporting the rights of the same individuals that behead innocent humans, are truly the delusionary.    God Bless Marcus, Mikey, Axe, and Danny!    Those of you that rate this book less than 4 stars, do something for America.  Something that cost you something!    God bless America!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|First, if you watch this film for the just the sex then you are missing the whole point of the film. The film is about human connections (and mis-connections) and sex is the ultimate human connection. The film is a celebration of alternative culture and love. Watching it is like an antidote to the Bush era. The music from the film is wonderful and I highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack. Thank you John Cameron Mitchell!

The evil scientist, Dr. Isaacs, from Apocalypse is still around in Extinction and he's obsessed and awed with Alice and bit on the crazy side. As with most experiments, chaos ensues.<br /><br />I jumped a lot thanks to a lot of well placed sound effects and scary decaying zombies. My only complaint was all the landscape panning. I had to look away often because it was making me nauseous.<br /><br />It was nice to see Oded Fehr again as Carlos Olivera and Ali Larter, from the television hit Heroes, was a welcome addition as the leader of a band of survivors. The film didn't really answer any questions this go around. It was more about surviving the virus and zombies, finding a cure and exacting revenge. And of course Milla Jovovich kicks a lot of zombie butt in the form of man, dog and bird.<br /><br />In my opinion, although it's been said there will only be three films, they left it open for the possibility of more. Overall, I loved it and am looking forward to seeing it on DVD. Reviewed by M.E. Wood.
061891868X|5.0|I found this book to be superbly written and full of fascinating insights. I really loved reading it. Many of the longer reviews here do a great job of reviewing the content of the book, so I'll stick to offering my opinion.    I will no doubt read this book again in the future as much of the content was way over my head. However, as with any great book on any subject, this did not prevent me from thoroughly enjoying it and learning a lot. What makes it so great is that each time I read it I will learn more.    I want to thank Lee Smolin for putting the current state of his field in some perspective. I highly, highly recommend this book!
B000VT55G4|1.0|Cusack, a retired cop, versus Freeman, an assassin on the job...you might say to yourself, there's no way this movie could go wrong.<br />It does.<br />Despite an otherwise original script for the overdone fugitive-from-justice genre, the plot and characters' actions are incredible predictable. I hope Cusack and Freeman make a new contract with each other - never work the same film again.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|It arrived on time. And the DVD's condition is good. Thanks to guy who selled it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|If you attended one of these show, as I did, itsa must.<br />If you even have a slight interest in Pink Floyd, itsa must.<br />If you like seeing some of the coolest lighting effects, ever, itsa must<br /><br />This may be the ultimate Floyd related dvd. Seriously with the show and all the bonus stuff(extra songs, 3 documentaries) it blows Pulse away, and is neck and neck with Live at Pompeii.<br /><br />The Floyd songs seem to rock a lot harder than ever before, and On an Island, while not up to par with Floyd, is solid. And a few of the songs live are as good as it gets.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Don't let the plethora of negative reviews fool you.  I challenge you to watch it and decide for yourself. No, it is not a literally accurate visual representation of the epic poem, but neither does it betray the spirit of the original. If you are familiar with the Anglo-Saxon classic Beowulf you will not want to miss this brilliant and poignant re-interpretation of the story with solid performances and realistic characters, more human than heroic. If, on the other hand, you are not familiar with the tale this movie might prove to be a little hard to follow. Based on the reviews I was expecting a poorly constructed, poorly acted action adventure. What I got was a very pleasant surprise!  Decide for yourself!
0446577383|1.0|Nobody loves a conspiracy theory more than me.  But not this one.  Mainly because its not a thriller so much as a thinly disguised attempt to tell us we really are the Great Satan, and that Americans would be better off with a Socialist government, and that peace is attainable only if we give half of our wealth to the Muslims of the world.<br /><br />First, the book.  It seems that there's a conspiracy within Homeland Security, and that only 4 or 5 well placed people there can actually dupe the whole multi-billion dollar system.  Ok.  I've had to suspend belief beyond this chidish assumption, so let's soldier on.  Then, we plod along for almost 400 pages, where we learn the following:<br />1.  The world's resources should be doled out equally to the world's inhabitants like a plate of Grandma's tasty pastries, because she'll never make another one, and that's the only fair thing to do.<br />2.  Good decent Muslims only came to hate us because of Iraq.<br />3.  But for the first two points, there would be peace in the middle east.<br />4.  Mentally deranged geniuses and hobos can save the world, without telling anyone.<br />5.  Our government officials, gloating over our superiority,  are kept from raining nuclear weapons on the world without provocation only by the slimmest of fortuitous events.<br /><br />Good lord.<br /><br />The Camel Club has an unnecessarily confusing beginning, a tediously, plodding middle and finishes so abruptly and implausibly we're left with the impression Balducci either tired of writing or his editors forced him into a timeline.<br /><br />In the last 100 pages, we're introduced to new characters of such malicious, evil stupidity that the whole book could have been written about them.  Here they are only used to bring some strange and bizarre ending.<br /><br />In the Camel Club, we give Balducci virtually 600 pages of our precious time to prove why Americans are at fault for 9/11 because we really are the Great Satan.  He does a terrible job, and ends up revealing the argument for the tragic parody it really is.<br /><br />I've tried to like David Balducci.  I really have.  But really, this guy gets rich doing this?  Please.  And in the middle of a war yet.  What an insulting time to display his insidious and childish sermonizing.rody it really is.    I've tried to like David Balducci.  I really have.  But really, this guy gets rich doing this?  Please.  And in the middle of a war yet.  What an insulting time to display his insidious and childish sermonizing.
B000002JR8|3.0|The first four songs of this release are classic relentless Pantera. Strength Beyond Strength, 5 Minutes Alone, and Becoming are some of Pantera's best work. If this is true then why do I give it only 3 stars? Probably because after the opening 4 songs, I don't find anything else on this album that memorable, with the exception of their cover of Sabbath's Planet Caravan. I can put in Cowboys From Hell and Vulgar Display and listen all of the way threw over and over, however, midway through this album I grow a but tired and generally take it out to listen to something else. It's not that those songs are necessarily bad, just not as memorable as previous Pantera tunes. Of course if your a Pantera fan, this album is well worth buying, but if you don't own any of their albums start with Vulgar Display Of Power and Cowboys From Hell...
B00005OBSD|3.0|I didn't know what to think at first when I had first heard this album. It sounds like a combination of alot of classic rock bands debut's ,(Cream , Black Sabbath, Scorpions first,......) it also feels like some of these songs were unfinished. Even though I feel weary about this album, it isn't that bad ,it's just missing something I can't put my finger on yet.
B000Q9IZ5C|2.0|I love the TV show Firefly. It was such a unique take on humanity's future with the combination of space travel, intermixed with the morals of the Old West.<br /><br />It seems to me that science fiction fans (and I am one of them) are very loyal and aware of the history of the characters and the rules of the environment (see Light Sabers in Star Wars). Sadly, Serenity changed some of the events of the TV series. Although I am not happy about the changes I am a big fan of the movie.<br /><br />While I hope all Firefly fans will buy the Collector's Edition to support more tales of the crew of Serenity, there is nothing truly new on the second disc.
B00005NIL9|4.0|The songs on here are great, the album that kept them on the map. my only problem was that it's great for the bonus tracks on remasters , but how many versions of \\"All Right Now\\" had to be included on this?
B0002TT0NW|1.0|i remember when i watched this movie in the movie theater. i loved it. definitely one of the best ones of the harry potter franchise. then, in christmas, my parents gave me the widescreen dvd version of this film. in that time, i didnt liked the widescreen format, now i love it. but, since back then i didnt liked the widescreen format, i sold the widescreen dvd version i got, and i bought the fullscreen version later. that was one of the biggest mistakes i've made in my life. i mean, when you watch the movie, the picture quality is horrible!another thing is that,like, in one shot, harry potter might be talking to Professor Lupin, and you see harry but you dont see Professor Lupin! that's retarded! it looks as if harry was talking to himself! and, there's drizzle in the whole movie! warner bros. might have forgotten to clean the picture quality of this movie. the picture quality for this movie is surely of the worst ive seen in my life. another thing is that, in one scene, harry potter and rons dad are talking in the leaky cauldron, in the left down side of the screen you see a code or something like that. i think those things come in every dvd in history. im not sure what they are for, but in this movie, they are so easy to catch! so, overall, dont buy this fullscreen version. its such a wonderful movie and it is a real shame to watch it in such a horrible picture quality. even if you dont like widescreen pictures, still buy the widescreen version for this movie. you will find out that some buy black bars and a small picture are nothing compared to drizzle an sloppy camera angles.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Very nice boxed edition. First DVD, since DVD's came out, that I actually watched all the special features and such. I'd highly recommend to any fan of firefly and/or serenity.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|this movie is so awfully bad. so bad. the plot is about the brothers grimm, which in real life they were the authors of stories such as the red riding hood and the gingerbread man. and, in the movie, they have to solve a mistery of girls disappearing in the expense of the characters from their stories. how dumb does that sound? and the movie is even dumber, since they show a girl being turned into the gingerbread man and a girl getting eaten by a horse. now how does the movie sound to you? and, in fact, the acting was horrible. too bad that such a bad movie has such good cinematography, but even good cinematography cant rescue this stinker. and, in fact, this movie is scary, and i hate being scared in a movie. so, overall, dont you ever watch this movie, ever. i hate this movie with every single cell in my body, so will you, and if you like this movie, good grieve, i pity you for being such a bad movie critic. i cant believe the critics liked this movie. they think it is better than eragon. i mean, eragon wasnt a great movie, but it is the best movie in the world compared to this one, and the brothers grimm compared to the lord of the rings movies, which i think are the greatest movies in history, well, the brothers grimm movie looks like the devil and the lord of the rings movies looke like God. that might give you an idea how bad this movie is. so, never watch this movie. if amazon gave me more stars rating choices, i would give this movie minus an infinity of stars.
B000000OPZ|5.0|I love reading reviews that slam certain artists for being too \\"commercial\\" and whatnot.  So what.  I was 15 years old when I bought this cassette and I wore it out during my freshman year of high school.  At the time I had no idea who Deep Purple or Thin Lizzy was and probably wouldn't have cared.<br /><br />I still have the original cassette that I bought in 1987.  I recently converted it to an mp3 so I could get it onto my iPod and don't regret it a bit.  Yes, some of the songs are cheesy and \\"glam\\" but it will definitely take you back in time.<br /><br />If you loved them in the '80s or you're a fan of this genre you should definitely get this.  Don't be embarrassed.  Go get some tight leather pants and a pretty scarf and you'll be just fine.

B000AYEL1A|4.0|I am from Panama city Panama, and  remebered the anticipation I felt on the opening of ´Streisand´s A Star is born¨, so much that I watched it 25 times at the time. Why?  Guess pure love for la Diva. WAtching it today is still as moving, and beautiful as ever. Kristofferson's wounded look, Streisand's love and her voice, perfeclty captured the well know story of a star on a downhill road and another about to become one big star.This nes edition, is perfectly remastered. Buy it, watch it again and again and enjoy.      Rafael Reyes, Panama City Panama
0307387178|5.0|Here we have a non-fiction adventure tale (sort of) which is really two books in one. The primary focus is on one guy who takes on Mount Denali (Alaska) and I have to stop there to avoid a spoiler. The second facet of the book is about people who have become \\"lost\\" elsewhere, in other wilderness environments, and the consequences of those occasions.<br />The book is a fluid read and it's in my top 20% of all books that I've read over the years. Anyone who savors adventure tales and true suspense will enjoy this one.<br />A great gift for young adults!
B000C3H4M2|3.0|Back in the day (college, late 70s, early 80s), I loved Talking Heads.  The music was infectious new wave pop with a heavy R&B influence.  David Byrne's artsy vocals seemed deep and creative.<br /><br />It's interesting how some bands that one loved in one's youth hold up to the test of time, while others don't.  Talking Heads don't.  My vinyl Talking Heads LPs have been sitting on my shelf, unlistened, for years.  The transition LP, \\"Fear of Music,\\" where they moved from quirky new wave pop of the first two LPs to Eno-fied worldbeat of their remaining career, was probably my favorite.  I saw it for sale at a decent price -- with bonus tracks! -- always a sucker for bonus tracks -- and decided to give the Heads a spin.<br /><br />The CD side sounds great.  The instrumentation is clearer, more distinct, more professional sounding with the new remix.  David Byrne's quirky vocals, however, do not benefit from the remixing.  The vocals are too upfront.  They don't blend with the music anymore.  And Byrne's quirky vocal style, and his weird-for-weirdness's sake lyrics, don't hold up 25 years later.  In college, when we heard the line \\"look over there! / Dry ice factory / Good place to get some thinking done,\\" we thought Byrne was deep and creative.  Now, my attitude is:  \\"what the ---- ???\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of music from the new wave era -- the Golden Age of Rock 'n Roll! -- that I still listen to.  That era dominates my mp3 player.  But, in my opinion, Talking Heads doesn't hold up to the test of time.  Your milage may vary.
0321334876|5.0|This book really helps you become a sharper c++ class designer.  Tips are brief and yet very well explained.  I read the book from A to Z in a single day!.  I highly recomend this book for c++ programmers of any level of experience.
B00005JPRF|4.0|You know I thought the first resident evil film in 02 was a good solid zombie movie(for someone that wasn't familiar with the intricacies of the video games story line)and, at the end of one, I anxiously awaited the sequel. Which as I understand it was closer to the video game than the first one. As far as a sequel was concerned it was o.k. So when the latest installment hit the theaters, I was a little skeptical. But after seeing it. I was like...Damn! Not bad.  If you're gonna make a third installment after an ok second, how do you make it good? you take the new storyline and take the best elements of the first movie and combine them.  And thats what they did.  The story line is simple, but contiues the progress of the T-virus in which has taken over earth to leave only  a sparce scattering of survivors, and for some odd reason has turned the land masses on the planet into barren wastelands, as the modern day plague has decimated lakes and rivers and most vegetation.  Some  of the elements taken from the first movie that are used in RE:E, One; Zombie Doberman pinchers, yep alice(mila Jovovich) is set upon by more of the undead Canines. Two; Creepy, edgy investigation of locations.  Remember in the first movie, the special ops team, alice, the cop, and alices' 'husband' investigate the hive and it was eerie and silent, Same feel. Three; Loud noises and crap that jumps out at you, (always a favorite in any horror film) Four; Laser booby trap. Yep the same one the cube severs the sergeant in one is featured here, not once but twice. Five; a desperate fight against incredible odds with some pretty speedy and strong zombies, Lotsa head shots, and a lot of blade kills thanks to alices new weapons. Lastly; Fight with a mutated zombie S.O.B. pretty cool.  However even though there was all these elements in RE:E there were some things that I thought were too similar to elements in other horror films. For instance the new hive facility in nevada is using clones of alice totry to find a antidote for the T virus, but once the get blood from the new clone they ace her and throw her in a ditch with the rest of the alice clones they've killed.  This reminds me of Alien Ressurection where Ripley(a clone)discovers all the clones that were made before her.  And to follow suite Alice comes across all the clones in the ditch.  Next is Alices' ability of Telekenesis, which she uses a couple times in the film, only to find herself drained of energy when she does something stupendous. Near the end of this film she squares off with the big mutant ugly and uses some of her power againt it. I think this scene was(at least a little bit)from Friday the 13th part 7 the new blood in which Tina Shepard(a young woman with Telekensis goes head to head with Jason Vorhees.  Another scene is when Alice has to get into the other hive facility, but has to go through a veritable sea of zombies. Carlos Oliveira(Oded Fehr)decides to sacrifice himself and drive a gasoline tanker through it and clear a path. Well the explosion that vaporizes a few waves of zombies was pretty spectacular, but was better done in the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  There were other similiarities to other horror films, but the others were not as significant.  A couple of cool elements they added to RE:E was the crows, because they've been feeding on undead flesh, they themselves have sorta turned into undead. I guess the dogs weren't the only animals affected by the T-Virus.  The only other thing I thought was pretty cool was the ending, yeah they left it open for a sequel, but I'm not saying how, you got to see it for yourself.  I hope they do make a sequel I think if they did it right it would be pretty awesome.  For a zombie film, RE:E didn't rely to heavily on gratuitous gore. It was gory where it needed to be. Bottom Line.....Entertaining, I'll buy it when it hits dvd.
B000000WI4|5.0|This great 1991 recording captures JLH with a galaxy stars in the Winter of his career. You might think this would be a recipe for an awful album -you'd be wrong.<br /><br />From the first notes you know this is going to great. Johnnie Johnson's Piano (Chuck Berry's long time Piano Player) introduces us to \\"I Want To Hug You\\" and then that voice comes in. This is no messin' straightahead boogie. The title track follows with the Robery Cray band supporting JLH. This is my favourite track. Great guitar playing from Robert Cray with JLH refusing to be quiet in the background!<br /><br />There are no duff tracks on this album, and if you like the blues there will be something for you. Oh this bliss....

B000QQFKYE|5.0|Other reviewers have already discussed the artisty of this movie so I won't.  It is simply an excellent movie, not for everyone, but excellent nonetheless.  The DVD package is similarly excellent, particularly for a David Lynch DVD.  It actually has chapter stops!  It has a useful display calibration tool!  The special features are extensive and great, particularly the David Lynch interview (\\"Stories\\"), the behind the scenes feature (\\"Lynch 2\\"), and the 75 minutes of additional movie footage.  I loved Lynch's rant against watching movies on your phone.  Who knew Lynch is an audiophile? Fantastic!! If you have liked any of the less commercial David Lynch offerings in the past (e.g. Eraserhead), you will love this movie and DVD.    BTW, can anyone confirm if the Polish in the movie matches the subtitles?
B000683VI4|2.0|So I finally got around to seeing the movie that I heard was SO sad and SO good and was thoroughly disappointed. Boring romance; nothing really unique.  I'm assuming the story is about the power of love, but isn't every love story about that? It lacked depth, and I've seen comedies that were sadder. Literally.    Fortunately, it saved itself from one star I would otherwise have given by the redeeming (though sadly brief) role of James Marsden, just by his being so gorgeous.
0761129235|5.0|I have red several books In trying to search for the best answers on how to succeed and accomplish goals... However All those books gave me some inspiration although it was so short-term that all the time I attmempted to even try to do something that will make me successful I will always panic and suffer through a great degree of procrastination that It came to the point where I will never even START to give it a go...Why? Because Most personal development books mention that you got to want to succeed so bad and make a really big goal...that created a mental bloackages that has never been able to surpass the obstacles that got in my way..The bigger the goal the more i thought about it there more the Fear grew within me that it has left me with a feeling of helpessness and often paralized my thinking, .. It has taught me so much into..  tip-toing my way through fear to achieve a goal...the book has provided me a powerhouse of great loving information..and has transmutted all my big scary, frustrating, negative questions.. too tiny, small, fragmental questions that has really changed my life! And I've only red the first chapter! I have had several panic attacks for as long as 7 years... I am now 19 yrs old and at such a young age it has greatly contributed to all areas of my life.. I now do not hesitate ever as the questions I ask myself are the smallest and most efficient than ever ! Highly recommend this book For those that have cant achieve Brand new big goals.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|This two disc edition of The Wickerman is well worth getting for 3 reasons.<br /><br />Firstly this is a great film that is worth seeing whether you want a special edition or not. Contrary to one of the previous reviewers I found the DVD quality to be good. The extended version of the film on disc 2 does suffer from poor quality, but only in the 15 restored minutes.<br /><br />Secondly the longer version of the film is much better (regardless of quality). The whole film makes more sense and crucial missing opening scene explains quite a lot about Edward Woodwards character.<br /><br />Thirdly the commentaries by Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward and Robin Hardy (the director) are marvellous. These are very informative and Christopher Lee in particular is very passionate about the film.<br /><br />This is a strongly recommended DVD, which can be picked very cheap if you hunt around.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have agonized for years to try to review this album, yet I never could take OK Computer's immense power and translate it into mere type.  So my review of the greatest recording ever made by man is:  Listen to the album  from Airbag to Let Down.  You will feel reborn.  It is so powerful that words can't describe.           I still remember the first time I heard the album 9 years ago, on an otherwise unremarkable day.  I knew from the first chord progressions of \\"Airbag\\" that I was in for a ride.  And, oh, what a ride. Nine years (and probably  3000 times) later and the album just keeps sounding better.  It defies reality!
B000R7HY0K|2.0|This movie should have been 45 mins shorter.  The endless and vacuous girl talk may appeal to some, but not to me.  The action scenes are superb, but the viewer has to wait for nearly 50 mins until something happens!  I didn't see this at the theater and regret it sorely.  This movie was surely better as the 2nd part of the \\"Grindhouse\\" and ALOT shorter!!!!  This DVD is simply a highly cynical exercise in squeezing money from a flop movie and does the movie and the artists who created it no justice whatsoever.
B000066SBB|5.0|Simply put, Aretha Franklin is the greatest female R&B singer of of the modern pop era.  The queen of soul has many cd compilations out there, but none compare to this career spanning two disc set, that encompasses her entire hit career from 1967 to 1997.  This collection of 43 songs surpasses her 30 greatest hits collection due to the inclusion of such later day hits as \\"Who's zoomin Who', \\"Freeway Of Love', \\"Sisters Are doing It For Themselves[with Annie lennox]\\" to name a few.  Everyone of her classic songs from the 60's and 70's are right here for you to enjoy.  I can't think of a more bargain priced career retropspective that covers her entire career.  \\"Respect, The very best Of Aretha Franklin\\", is truly a time capsule, that serves as the sound track to many of our lives who were around for those classic soul days of Atlantic Records, in which lady soul Miss Aretha Franklin started a musical legacy that remains unsurpassed in the annals of pop- music.  I consider this an essential purchase in order to make any music library complete.
0802130208|5.0|I am fascinated by people who do not find this book absolutely hysterical.  John Kennedy Toole was brilliant.  I laughed out loud through the entire story.  The characters are absurd, the story line is chaotic, and the writing is engaging.  'Confederacy of Dunces' is genius.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Even though many of Michael's songs are oldies, his arrangements make them feel new again.  I purchased this CD for the new songs he has but I have fallen for every single song on this CD.  Well worth the money.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000JBWWQ0 The Celestine Prophecy]]  It has been awhile since I've read James Redfield's Books but I still enjoyed the movie especially the second time around.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|\\"And when I touch you, I feel happy inside,\\" was the simple lyric that rocked my world during grade school days.  The Beatles were an incredible band, unmatched in their ability to play off each other and creatively spark their listeners and hold their imaginations.  From the tight harmonies and rocking tunes from their early days from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"I Feel Fine,\\" they blazed across the Atlantic and touched the world.  John Lennon's urgent voice singing, \\"I've been working like a dog ... I should be sleeping like a log, but when I get home to you, I find the things you do will make me feel all right\\" on \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" burst with incredible energy.  \\"Day Tripper\\" has one of the most distinctive bass lines ever recorded with McCartney's genius in full bloom and Harrison's slamming lead guitar, \\"Got a good reason for taking the easy way out.\\"  The Beatles' middle period where they moved from a singles band to phenomenon where legions waited for each new album is reflected in the inventively different \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" with the stunning string arrangement, so incredibly different from the rest of radio.  The Beatles were great businessmen, but they also were incredible artists.  Looking back, I'm so pleased that George Harrison's \\"Something\\" reached the top of the charts.  His emotionally charged guitar was always a tremendously important, if slightly understated, element of their success.  \\"Somewhere in her smile she knows that I don't need no other lover, something in her style that shows me\\" is such an incredibly intimate lyric married to such a beautiful melody and Harrison's guitar sounding like part ecstasy, part teardrop.  This collection is such an excellent single disc that it really is a pearl of great price.  Enjoy!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|If I had never heard LP before I would love this album, but for us fans who have been long awaiting this new album it is a dud.  LP have lost their edge and most of their songs on this album feature only one of the vocalists (Shinoda or Chester) not both of them together like they have done in the past.  With that said, I do like the album and I have listened to it over and over.  I just miss what LP had brought to the table with their previous albums.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought this dvd set mainly for the price and my friends recommendations. Was I pleasantly surprised! The characters are fun and easily believable. I love Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under. It is great to see him in a heterosexual role, even though sex with his girlfriend is painful! I am not much of a blood and gore type person but this is somehow different. It freaks me out to realize I am rooting for a Serial Killer! (yes, I know this is fiction!). Some scenes are a little uncomfortable but that just ramps up the excitement. I can't recommend this wonderful Showtime series more.
B0001932ZA|1.0|This movie SUCKS! Period. I read the book by Stephen King and it rocked. This disasterpiece trashed, wrecked, and destroyed the book. You want to see Arnold in a real film? See Terminators 1 and 2. Ignore this rubbish and stick to the book.

B000055ZB8|5.0|The German silent film classic \\"Nosferatu\\" was nearly lost to history less than three years after its release in 1922.  The movie follows the exact same plot as all other adaptations of Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\", so I won't continue with a review of an already well known story.  The film itself has a history that is every bit as interesting as the movie's storyline.  The film's director F.W. Murnau, had applied for the rights to the book, as well as the play adaptation, so he could make them into a movie. While waiting for the rights to be accquired, Murnau went ahead with production, changing character names and locations, in the hope that this would get him around the copyright laws. He seemed to know that the rights would never be his, and on a shoestring budget, he rushed from one hugh outdoor set to the next, to complete his masterpiece. Bram Stoker's widow, Florence sued the movie's studio Prana-Film, and won her case.  The studio in turn filed bankruptcy, and the film dissappeared from the publics view shortly after its release.  Florence Stoker eventually decided to have the court produce an order for the films destruction, which they did, that order included every known copy in existence.  However, then, as today, you had people who made pirated copies of the film to keep as their own.  And that is the reason this film exists today.  It was a movie ordered destroyed because it had pirated its own storyline, but in the end, was saved for later generations by piracy of the movie itself.  A true paradox in film history.      The title character is played by a then unknown German actor named Max Schreck, and together with Murnau, they created the most terrifying vampire ever brought to the screen.  Nothing in film, has come even remotely close to Schreck's Count Orlok for outright repugnance.  Unquestionably, the character remains the ugliest vampire ever created.  More animal like than human, Schreck had an overly large, mostly bald head, with pointed ears and alarge hooked nose.  His hands had extremely long, talon like fingers, that one could actually envision him using while on his unending quest for blood.  Fittingly, Schreck's Count was also as pale and skinny as a corpse, a fact which seemed to be at odds with the remarkable, and seemingly effortless feats of strength he was capable of performing.  For example, he carries a full sized, dirt filled, wooden coffin from the London docks all the way to his newly accquired home, under one arm, like anyone else might carry a small suitcase.  The films other characters almost seem needless once Schreck appears on the screen, in fact, they appear as nothing more than targets of the vampires blood lust, as he travels from his Carpathian home to London. Of course, in the end, good triumphs over evil, and the vampire is killed through a selfless act of love.     Had the film not been kept from the public's view for so long, Schreck would have been a well remembered star in his day, and Murnau would have gotten the recognition he deserved for this film, as it was quite an accomplishment for its time.  But that is something he would never see, since he was killed at the age of 43, in a car crash in 1929, only seven years after completing \\"Nosferatu\\".  Despite all of this, it appears as if his film, like vampires themselves, will have a long and undying history that is already rich in little known details.  It remains one of the best silent films ever made; and it will continue to stand on it's own merits, against the test of time.

I feel like this is a great book for avid readers, but also for people who don't read as well. By that, I mean that I think it is good for people who like crazy movies like Vanilla Sky or any David Fincher films....if you read it, you'll know what I mean.

1582701709|1.0|The only secret about this book is how the publishers are getting rich off of such garbage.  The ideas are not original.  The book is more a collection of applicable quotes that have to do with positive thinking.  It can really be summed up by one direction - \\"think positively and all your selfish desires will come true\\"  I think this book was hyped WAY too much.  If you want to get rich quick and are a pessimist about everything- maybe this book is for you.    What ever happened to thinking positively and DOING positively, not just for your own good but the good of all those you touch in your life?  Save yourself a few bucks...and just try praying, volunteering, being kind and sharing your gifts with those around you.
1594489505|5.0|This is a must read for everyone interested in people of other lands, especially those we think of as enemies.  It opens your eyes as to their laws, their everyday living and their love of family.  You will find that we are not very different from one another.  Only the politicians keep us apart in our thinking. I felt as if I was living with them and part of their family.  I hope Khaled Hosseini keeps writing as I sure will keep reading about this strange and lovely land and its' history.

B000QXDH42|4.0|Generally, Black Metal live records and/or bootlegs leave much to be desired.<br /><br />Considering the history of Mayhem, and especially what is known of this particular lineup, I think this is a fitting release and should sit alongside of the other official Mayhem releases as a full-length LP.<br /><br />This stands out as a \\"Live\\" record simply for the fact that \\"Dead\\" is the vocalist on it. Considering his grim, necro outlook, I don't think a studio would have been a fitting place for him to lay down his vocals to begin with. That's not to say I wouldn't have liked to hear it anyway. With Mayhem, you sort of take what they give you and try not to ask questions...<br /><br />The live setting captures his voice in a good way, and it's not a bad recording for live black metal show at all.<br /><br />Pick this one up if you are a Mayhem fan.
