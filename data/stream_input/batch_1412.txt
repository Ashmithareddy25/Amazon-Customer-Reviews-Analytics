B00701QVVY|4.0|Good album, no where near the level of Ironbound. If you like thrash, and if you like Overkill, this album is still a must own. No one song sticks out to me (unlike Ironbound that has many standout tracks) and a lot of the riffs sound forced and recycled. The fact remains, these guys are the same age ( and from the same era ) as the boys from Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer etc. and they are( in my opinion)the best and most underrated of the genre. If you like Overkill, or thrash in general, this album will satiate your metal palette, just don't expect another masterpiece like Ironbound.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great movie, bought from Amazon. Was received ontime. Will buy from seller (Inetvideo) again. Very good story of a king, who had a terrible speech impediment, and overcame it. Thanks to his adoring wife, and a very good friend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rarely review anything and read maybe 2 books a week, however, I picked the kindle version up 2 days ago and put it down just once! Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing such a fun, suspense filled, brutal, creative, brilliant read! One of my favorite lines: \\"No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you
0887307280|5.0|This book has really motivated me to improve how I improve my systems.  I have already made several improvements since starting to read this book 2 weeks ago.  I also have a clear method that works to help me make further improvements.  I can't wait to read the final 50 pages.
B0001M0A4I|3.0|I was pleased to have found this Cd, another Tony Banks. I was excited to experience a more straight forward symphonic work by him. It is a nice piece with good Banksian touches, an interesting sound experience. I would recommend it to Banks fans everywhere.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just finished this series last night.  I have to say it was one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.  Great story, characters, and plot.  Hats off to you Mr. Howey...can't wait for Wool 6.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are a tun of games that are great and fun to play.<br />it really broadens your horizon on how games really work.
B00466HM28|5.0|Product worked exactly as specified. Please note that you will also need to purchase some type of sequencing software to utilize the product successfully which would be an additional cost.
0399250573|5.0|(Hi, I'm 12 years old.)I loved the story line but I think Anthony Horrwitz shouldn't have tried to have SO much drama. Like when Jack died, he tried to make it sound SO dramatic! Hey don't get me wrong, I love this book, but he probobly shoudn't have tried to make it sound dramatic.
B0073XORLU|4.0|As author of the still afloat book JETHRO TULL: A HISTORY OF THE BAND, my \\"Tull pedigree\\" is assured, so I hesitated even to write anything about this bizarre attempt to capitalize on a 40-year-old masterwork.  But don't ever expect anything conventional from Ian Anderson, whom I've known for the past 30 years.  All I wish to write is that I approached hearing this with mixed feelings; hell, much trepidation!  But, having said that, I listened to this album for what it is, rather than for what it isn't (the original TAAB or a true Jethro Tull album--aside from Martin Barre [dear Lancelot!], Tull always has been Ian and whomever is currently playing with him), and I wound up enjoying it far more than I ever expected I would.<br /><br />People too often just want more of the same from any kind of artist; being a sort of one myself, I can tell you that the LAST thing one likes to do is crank out something exactly like he did 40 years ago.  I never read my own work once it's \\"out there,\\" because I always work the bum off to do better.  LIFE (and near-death) happens, one gets older, and necessarily things change--like Ian's voice, which pretty well went missing in 1984.  His flute playing has steadily improved over the years, and this has actually harmed his voice, because singing uses muscles in a way opposite to the playing of the flute.<br /><br />I miss the wonderful Mr. Barre, but Florian Ophale is no slouch.  There is NO WAY anyone could ever fill Martin's shoes, and I suspect he didn't want to play on this album.  He's never really been content with \\"more of the same.\\"<br /><br />Listen, lads and lassies, saddle up on your Heavy Horse, and try to skate away on this thin ice of a rather tired old day, and listen to what's there, rather than just complaining about what isn't.  There are too many would-be critics of everything (when the views are mainly unqualified opinions), especially since this monster we call the internet has taken over the human race.  TAAB2 ain't bad for an ol' geezer and his current band o' minstrels.  After all, meanwhile, we'll never get back to the year one...If you want TAAB, listen to the original.  Give this an open ear, or even two, if you can manage it...
B006XF5BTG|5.0|A great book. Before I bought this book I knew next to nothing about dieting and exercising. This book teaches you the basics of what you need to know and then helps to setup a diet routine and an exercise routine. The author goes to great lengths to help you understand why he recommends eating a certain way.  If your a beginner like myself and you're looking for a book that teaches you all the basics about diet and exercise then this book is for you.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This review was posted on blog: Someone Who Actually Cares<br />[...]<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry was a perfect book for anyone who wants to read a little romance. The main characters, Brittany and Alex, shared a bond that couldn't be passed up. Their love towards each other made the book capturing to the reader. The author did an amazing job creating her characters and giving them both depth. Alex wasn't just some gang member who loved the rush of killing and drug dealing, and Brittany wasn't a shallow popular girl who had nothing going on in her head. Every page helped the reader truly understand and relate to the characters, even though their situations were too unique for one to fully understand the emotional effect of their loses. The ending was the most amazing and endearing completion to any book that I have read. The book ending didn't make me mad or upset; it had the perfect amount of mystery so that I could imagine, but it also had enough completion so that I wouldn't get mad that she didn't finalize everything. The only bad part about the book would have to be all the Spanish that I didn't know. While it gave me joy to know most of the words that they were saying, it would've been nice if the author put a glossary or explained some of the less known Spanish words. I had a feeling that some of the words she used were Spanish cuss words, but I still don't know. None the less, I'd give this book a 5 out of 5 because it captured my heart and I thought it was amazing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely loved all of these games... fun to play and I just love it. I would reccommend this to anyone who loves to play good games!
0439023513|5.0|This is the third in the series and I had read the first two, so I had to read this one. Though an older adult, I did enjoy all three.  This is not classic writing and it will probably not go down as such. But if you are looking for a fast read that is enjoyable, this may interest you. The full story line follows a theme and the characters are mostly fleshed out.  The violence to the weak stomached may seem unnecessary but it serves a purpose.  this takes to the extreme what could happen if we continue to minimize our children,
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought my Turtle beaches last June(2011) and I got them from Walmart for 60 bucks so the price on amazon is good. These are a great headset, lightweight, fit well, and the sound quality is really good. I used to play Call of Duty with just my tv and after getting these its a lot better, you will improve, you can hear sounds better and the directions too, and if someone is running up behind you. These aren't wireless and thats fine because you never have to worry about them dying since they are plugged into your PS3 or Xbox, yet another great reason they can be used universally. The cord is about 15 feet long I believe so plenty of room to move around if you need to get up to stretch. Another great feature is the ability to adjust the volume of chat and the game sounds. Also with this you can turn the volume down all the way on your tv so your lady or male friend doesn't get mad at you. Honestly for 60 dollars this is definetly worth it, the other headsets that are a 100 dollars and up are not superior enough to warrant spending that kind of money. So these are a great headset and for the price its amazing. If I do break mine I wont hesitate to buy another pair. Also if you buy them from Walmart you get a 1 year warranty, I don't know what Amazon offers. Also I didn't give it 5 stars just because inbetween games sometimes there is a mild to low hissing sound but thats just like with any headset, the speakers pick up on sounds.
B004OT2UE2|5.0|I have been buying star wars toys from AMASON.COM for sometime & have always been pleased with the quality & speed of shippment. So when grandson suggest a star wars toy for something special, I always go to AMASON.COM.

B00000I41G|4.0|What can you say about Midnight Blue, Kenny Burrel at his best.  Cool sounds, jazz, a refreshing glass of ice tea and the best companion in the world.  Life at its best.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book was terrible. It was so dull and boring I found myself skimming parts of the book. I mean seriously, how can there be a war going on and the main character is NOT involved in the war?<br /><br />There was just no redeeming quality in this book to bump it up to 2 stars. None of the characters were interesting. Katniss who I started to dislike in \\"Catching Fire\\" I hated by the end of this book. Self centered, whiny, just spewing anger, what an interesting character. Peeta who was never my favorite character was at least a happy character, but not in this book. Psychotic schizophrenic to put it bluntly. Gale just seemed to be around to antagonize Katniss, and then Haymitch and Finnick, my 2 favorite characters were barely in it. Katniss and Peeta's characters changed so much since \\"The Hunger Games\\", and that's too bad because Katniss, though a little dull, was at least heroic, not indifferent like in \\"Mockinjay\\".<br /><br />That leads me to Finnick's death....really? Such a great character, who was even married in the book and you kill him like that? Just an \\"Oh well, he's dead.\\" Even Prim's death was lackluster since she was barely in the book.<br /><br />I found the writing very lazy too. Descriptions in this book weren't up to par with the first 2 books. Many things were never told to conclusion either. The end of the war.....how did that happen? Don't know because Katniss passed out. How did Peeta stabilize into a normal person that Katniss could end up with? Who knows, not important enough to include, I guess. What exactly went on with the trial? Not important enough either. How did Gale end up captured to being in a different district at the end? Glossed over in basically 2 sentences, and that's it. A cog in the all important love triangle was given a lazy ride off into the sunset. It's like Collins didn't know how to resolve each of these issues so didn't even bother trying.<br /><br />And really, what was up with the war? An EMP was used in the bookby the Capitol I believe, so why didn't the Rebels or the Capitol drop an EMP on each other? Because the war would have been over too soon I guess.<br /><br />I may have been able to give it 2 stars if Katniss had been killed, but we knew that wouldn't happen. We have to save the undecisive, whiny hero to appease the fans. Let's kill off Finnick in a quick unglorified death instead.<br /><br />At least Haymitch survived to lead the exact same life as before Katniss was even in the Hunger Games. Yayyy for the rebellion, back at square one.
B000T2OMX0|5.0|Muito boa interpretação!<br />Já ouvi dezenas de interpretes para as Suites para Violoncelo Solo de Bach, desde os clássicos ou populares (Pablo Casals, Jacqueline Du Pré, Mischa Maisky, Yo-Yo Ma, Mstislav Rostropovitch) até os menos conhecidos, e Queyras ainda  surpreende.<br />A qualidade do som é impecável, preservando os ruídos típicos do violoncelo.<br />O DVD é dispensável, embora seja interessante para conhecer como foi gravado e perceber a acústica do local.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|What a surprise. I read this book just to see what my teens were reading & immediately became hooked. What a gripping read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app! It has a lot of different versions of the Bible including my favorite the Douay Rheims.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I love this book although it wasn't my favourite Marian Keyes book - I think my favourite of hers is 'Is Anybody Out there?' The title is ironice because Rachel is not going on holiday, but to rehab. Her worried family have organised this for her because they are so worried about her alcoholism.It is funny, sad, and very cleverly-written.Marian Keyes is a fantastic writer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great app for passing time, for example on a car trip. Some of the minigames are more challenging than others. Enjoy unlocking all of them!
B0039PPW60|1.0|Really disappointing  that I received this product and it failed to turn on after 5 times of use. However, I am more disappointed that Behringer expects me to pay for the return shipping for replacement of a product that is not functioning due to their errors. Why am I paying an extra 20$ because their product is faulty? Seems like is should get a discount for having to deal with the hassle, right?
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is my favorite - of course I love Spider anyway but this is the one I liked the best and it was free.  I would have paid for it if I had to.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|These days it seems so many children's movies are so depressing or dark.  This one has its dark moments, but it is much more light hearted than others.  It's a favorite in our household.  Entertaining for parents too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ive never left a review on Amazon before but I loved this book so much I just had to this time. I almost didnt buy this because of some of the reviews mentioning BDSM which is not me at all & reading some of the negative reviews ~ im assuming they are into it & were disappointed that wasnt what this book was about. It is a very complex & moving love story which does have some very graphic sex scenes but never gets to far into S & M for me.<br /><br />It is about Anastasia Steele who is just about to graduate from college and Christian Grey an entrepreneur she interviews for the college paper. He is gorgeous & she is shy. As the story goes on you find out he has had a horrific childhood in more than one way & the book is how they both deal with it.<br /><br />Warning #1: From reading the negative reviews let me say that if you dont like romance novels there is a good chance you wont like this because at heart thats what it is.<br /><br />Warning #2: there are some sex scenes in here & if you a) dont like very discriptive sex scenes dont buy it or b) like hard core BDSM also dont buy it because it isnt like that!<br /><br />Warning #3: If your looking for a literary giant, a classic book that is written in old world style: then what the heck are you doing reading a romance novel?? & please dont write a negative review! I read several that bashed this book because it was somewhat like Twilight. (also a romance) I dont see that much in common between the two other than perhaps the lead female characters have a few personality traits that are similar~ but maybe its a good judge if you will like this one. I loved the Twilight books :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is one of the best games I know tell all your friends about this game because it is really the best
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a good game for when your bord also a grate game but if. yuk have an jpod it is small
0060775858|5.0|This is a children's classic that every household should own.  It's a wonderful, imaginative book that kids of all ages enjoy.
0374275637|5.0|From the outset I first read a review from a peer reviewed journal, that was, for me, the greatest ad for this book.  When the book arrived, I began to read and was totally enchanted by the simple but powerful descriptions of System 1 and System 2 thinking.  System 1 is the reactive response to a problem, while System 2 is the pensive, thinking before you act.  There are numerous examples of problem resolution explained in a simple System 1 way, but really were resolved by System 2 thinking, the thinking slow of the title.<br /><br />I was totally enthralled or wrapped in this book as Dr Kahneman could, if he wished, put on the airs and graces as a Nobel Prize winner, but frankly, he uses clarity and reason in all of his arguments and discussions at a level that anyone who can read can learn, understand, and benefit from Kahneman's hard earned learning experiences.<br /><br />A book of simple explanations of the complex problems he encountered using methods that he and his now deceased research partner Amos Tversky, developed.  I could only wish to be a fly on the wall during their mutual discussions and those of David Kahneman's with others mentioned in this book.<br /><br />A top quality, readable book that deserves to be part of both High School and University reading lists, whatever the course of study.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Not a bad little app. I like to have an app to look at instead of having to surf through the browser.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|I have Been waiting for this release for a while now and let me tell you it has been worth it !<br />Most progressive super-groups tend to stay at their on turf and no stray to uncharted lands of other genres , While they make great music it is not that unique , unlike Flying colors that essentially took some from almost all genres of music - i can hear influences like -> yes ,rush, The Beatles, Lenny Kravitz .<br />This album has it all and it delivers !<br /><br />Cant wait for the tour dates :)<br /><br />Dor
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this app is a very good way to waste some time on a rainy day or when your just bored. I would recommend to anyone
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i noticed a review saying it didnt work on the amaze, but it works fine on mine. i love the game! cant wait for some new levels.  and i hope you fire users get it soon!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was a big surprise! I loved it from start to finish! Not since The Dark Knight have I been so enthralled by a film experience! Further, I didn't know John Carter is based on a series of scifi books by Edgar Rice Burroughs from 1912. I had no idea that it inspired every scifi fantasty action adventure story and creator that I've loved mu whole life! John Carter novels inspired everything, even the grandaddy of all superheroes, Superman! Without John Carter, there would be no Star Trek, no Star Wars, no Avatar. For anyone that saw trailers for John Carter and thought it looked derivative of George Lucas's space opera, I have news for you. King George probably wouldn't be swimming in all our money at Skywalker Ranch if not for the Mr Burroughs' John Carter. All in all, anyone that loves grand adventure, vast imaginative worlds, giant old school Hollywood Ben-Hur type film making (with a romance).. Watch John Carter! Over and over! Buy it! Rent it! Gift it! Recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|well busy read the title cause I thought that was were u post it not in this box do sorry!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the hunger games was an edge of your seat nail biter! i loved every minute of it and never wanted to put the book down!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Great game which adds a new twist to the angry bird series. Not as much content I wanted but new levels will probably be added. A must by for Angry Bird fans.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I only recently discovered Wool and inhaled the whole Omnibus at once. I couldn't steal enough moments in the day to read it. On my Kindle, on my iPhone, in the car (not while driving), in the doc's office. I haven't read too much online about it because I wanted to keep it tucked away in my head, not expose myself to too much talk about it, just keep it as a special, precious place. I can't say why it's such a singular story, but it is. And you should read it. I read it for free through Amazon Prime on the Kindle and went to the author's site to make a donation. It's THAT good. Don't hesitate to read it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having every version available to me - in such a compact format. The reading plans are great too.
B0058VW36U|4.0|The lower levels are definitely more kid oriented. But the higher you go the more challenging it gets! If you like a fun puzzle that makes you think..this is the game for you!
B000000XB9|4.0|I am glad I purchased this CD.  It is fun listening to these songs that I enjoyed long ago when the band was together.<br /><br />My favorites on this CD:<br />Have You Ever Seen the Rain?<br />Proud Mary<br />Susie Q<br />Who'll Stop the Rain<br />I heard it Through the Grapevine (nice long version)<br /><br />I would have given this a 4 1/2 star, but it is not possible to give an extra 1/2 star.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My son and I are having a great time playing this game together.  He is learning a lot about how lifecused to me.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I bought this because everybody else around me was getting wrapped up in teh hype. Turns out the hype is warranted. I had a hard time making it through book one, but book two and three have captivated my attention. Recommend to all readers.
B000002KET|3.0|For some this album is where the wheels began to fall of the Sabbath train.  Others cite the album as a natural maturation of the band seeing them expand their pallet to a wider array of sounds and influences.  There is no doubt that \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" was different from the albums that came before it.  The thing that sticks out first and foremost is the introduction of Yes keyboard maestro Rick Wakeman to the mix.  Although Wakeman was not a member of Sabbath his fluid keys can be found all over this album.  The effect was sometimes to dilute the heaviness that Sabbath was known for on some tracks, but enhanced the overall presentation on others.  Whether this new direction was the right way to go is still debated by Sabbath fans to this day.  The title track on this album is one of my all time favorite Sabbath tunes.  The cuts that follow it, \\"National Acrobat\\", \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\", and \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" are all strong as well.  The last 3rd of the album begins to fall off a bit in quality.  The songs are ok, but to my ears not up to what the band had done previously.  Overall this is a good, but I would not say great, Sabbath album.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is such a great way to be able to read the Word of God easily and have it with you always.
0439023521|3.0|Written in first person, Hunger Games has little mystery and does not manage to tease my emotions. Katniss has a limited emotional range and personality. Characters had little effect on Katniss herself. The book has little epiphany moments, mysteries, or any symbolism. I feel bad teens read this instead of many other books that have been controversial classics in the past. I don't Hunger Games this one becoming a classic like Harry Potter. In 8 years people will have moved on and forgotten this series. Watch the movie instead.
B006P0FICE|5.0|This fantastic verision of Dumas' great novel, Three Musketeers, is the best movie I have seen bar none, in fifty years.  It has the best special effects, best actors, best action scenes, best sword fighting, and more.  It is far the best of the movies.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson is awesome, along with his beautifrul actress wife, Milla Jovanich.  I would like to see this entire cast make more movies.  If I had given out academy awards, it would have got them all.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical.  However, I really enjoyed reading it and loved that I could read it no matter where I was.  The story was great, a little slow to start off, but overall a great book and I would highly recommend it, especially to girls of all ages.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|Point Break. Not a timeless classic per se, but a movie that will be referenced with each new generation of movie watchers. It really shouldnt be a good movie, but is actually quite bad @$$. Keanu still throws some wooden lines out there, and Swayze kicks some obligatory @$$, including Anthony Kiedis's, lol. The thrill ride, and the adrenaline rush is really what this movie is all about...and the blu-ray definitely enhances it. The way to watch this movie without a doubt.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game it reminds me a lot of super Mario. I first saw it on my aunts kindle fire, I wanted it right after watching my aunts son play. I found it and downloaded the game when I got home to my Kindle.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was skeptic when i first picked up this book but by 30 pages in i knew that i was hooked. Martin brings this epic tale to life before your eyes and makes you never want to put it down. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good tale.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|It took a bit of courage to put up the money for this one. It isn't a bad film. Indeed it can be quite good but how do you follow Alec Guiness? And he enjoyed so much support! Alexander Knox played Control while Ian Richardson was the treacherous Bill Haydn. The BBC show kept you glued to the story for six hours. Gary Oldman's film was good. Alec Guiness was great! How do you give a fair evaluation? Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy needed the time to tell. With TV you can take your time. You can't keep people in their seats that long. Still if you liked the movie buy the BBC Production. They will undoubtedly consider Gary Oldham for another film, Smiley's People. It's a much easier story which deals with the capture of Karla by George Smiley.It's another terrific story that begins with a puzzling and embarrassing murder. The only other story is A Murder of Quality. Denholm Elliott played Smiley and played opposite Joss Auckland and Glenda Jackson who drags Smiley into a murder case at an elite School. Focus should take its time before it considers Smiley's People. Like Tinker the BBC did a six hour series but you can shorten this story with a quicker pace but they should take their time. In the meantime hey should consider A Murder of Quality. Le Carre wrote the screenplay and it only runs for 90 minutes. It gives Gary Oldham an opportunity to win over the audience with his performance before they finish with Smiley's People.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I liked the developer (google chrome) and how the makers made the game not glitchy. Please make angry birds space free! I love this game. you get much more out of the free version than the paid.
B007BLEKPM|2.0|I just found the story very thin and the charachers shallow.  Plotline boring A big yawn.  Leonardo as J. Edgar is terribly mis cast.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|A tormented woman's passion and courage - to reclaim her freedom & stature and bring to justice a misogynistic serial killer while befriending, aiding, rescuing, and making love to an investigative reporter in his own exhaustive hunt for the deadly truth - reigns supreme in the English language film version \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\\" Directed by David Fincher; Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara); screenplay adaptation by Steven Zaillian; film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall (won Academy Award); original three novels written by the late Swedish mystery novelist Stieg Larsson and superbly edited by Eva Gabrielsson. We are easily swept up in the complex, hyper-intriguing hunt by our heroine Lisbeth for a serial killer presented in a stunning sequential order of unfolding events and plot twists - that hold one almost in amazement at times.<br /><br />So much has been written about these tightly-woven films and their positive impact upon women and girls around the world, their influence on the romance-thriller genre in novel writing & screenwriting, their ferocity to tell a high-end story about a pair of fiercely intelligent serial killers and still keep it reigned into a powerful but digestible film storyline, and their tenacity to reel in the sub-plots and multiple plot endings into a precise denouement along a superior crescendo or ascending mode of action with an original wildly-filmed plot. Depth of character, sustained plot tension, and powerful, realistic acting performances dominate each film in such a way - that we want to see them again.<br /><br />Once in awhile we see these brilliant, pro-women, pro-active film trilogies take off and make their way into multiple languages - as if all along they were meant to be translated at breadneck speed throughout the world - so one and all - women and men - can drive a long distance to catch one or two of these films in sequence at a single movie theatre. Andwe are talking about movie goers going out in perhaps severe weather condition to see any one of these cinematic masterpieces. Realism, honesty, thorough journalistic practices, true mystery & suspense scriptwriting & storyboarding, sado-masochistic & erotic side-plots that tightly weave like electrifying eels returning to their comfort lair - back into the original storyline - all create an experiential type of cinema - that becomes exhilarating, challenging to the senses, sensual, and intensely played out for our enjoyment and enrichment.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I had watched a few different movies about the Vietnam war, ultimately settling on Platoon as my favorite.  I still feel Platoon is a very good movie, but when I watched Full Metal Jacket, everything else started coming off as fluff.  What is most interesting about Full Metal Jacket is that it really isn't a Vietnam movie; it is a war movie and a horror movie that happens to be set in Vietnam.  The Vietnam experience is recreated so well in every way that you can't help but feel that it is a period piece, but it really isn't.  Watch it a few times and your struck with the reality of this movie, as stated in the tagline:  War is Hell.  The acting in this movie is jaw-dropping.  Vincent D'Onofrio is the standout, with a performance that should easily have garnered an Oscar.  The score--done by Kubrick's daughter--is haunting and works perfectly with the movie.  Roger Ebert once criticized this movie, but unkowingly gave it its greatest compliment being the schmuck that he is.  Ebert stated that the movie seemed directionless in its plot.  If that does not describe the efforts in the Vietnam War, I really don't know what does.

B000G8NXYG|2.0|Together with the M.Scorcese's \\"The Raging Bull\\" this is one of the most overrated movies in the cinema history.I watched it twice trying to get it's \\"greatness\\" and \\"depth\\",but apart from a poor and flat story about a group of stinking villagers running with wooden spears from one place to another and screaming at each other I couldn't find anything that touched my heart or soul, or gave me food for thought.Three hours wasted for a primitive action schlock.<br />Don't get me wrong! I adore A.Kurosawa's real,timeless masterpieces,but not his \\"samurai films\\" (Seven Samurai,Yojimbo,Sanjuro and Hidden Fortress),which to my mind are his weakest and the least interesting.They BY NO MEANS are on the same league with such TRUE GEMS of Kurosawa like \\"Rashomon\\",\\"High And Low\\",\\"Ikiru\\",\\"Redbeard\\",\\"Bad Sleep Well\\",\\"Throne Of Blood\\",\\"Dersu Uzala\\",\\"Ran\\".Go for these eight films - they are real cinematic treasure!

1441850953|5.0|Well, if you're reading the review for an audiobook, and not for the book itself, I figure you want to know about the specifics of the audiobook, and not a review of the story.  So I'll say that the readers are excellent, they do a very good job.  I had gotten to really enjoy Jesse Bernstein (the reader for the Percy Jackson series) but understand that it might have been weird to have him voice this book, since it's a different character.<br /><br />Kevin R. Free does quite a good job as Carter, he has good pacing, enunciation, and just the right amount of emotions.  He did a good job of making the bad guys sound scary, without going overboard.<br /><br />Katherine Kellgren does her usual bang-up job (she is *amazing* in the Bloody Jack series).  She didn't just imitate Bloody Jack again, for this character she was subtly different enough that I kept thinking \\"is it her or not?\\" -- but with all the same incredible talent she showed in Bloody Jack. (it's really not normal to be this attached to a narrator, is it?  But dude, she's awesome!)[[ASIN:1608127532 Under the Jolly Roger [With Earbuds] (Bloody Jack Adventures (Playaway))]]<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable audiobook, a great story, well worth the listen!
0439023491|5.0|im 10 and all i have to say is wow! this book was so amazing it filled u with fear and suspense until the very end but it was just so great u cant stop reading im so glad i started reading the hunger games series i think it was better than the first book (even tho the first was spectacular also) its a perfect blend of action romance and the scent of dry comedy here and there i loved the parts with bonnie and twill and how the group formed that alliance but my absolute favorite part was when katniss found out she was the mockingjay and this book really gets your mind going and i know y its named the hunger games because once u finish the book your hungry for more but this book really is overall amazing with the characters the plot setting just everything the wonderful suzanne collins thought of it all and more i cant wait to read mockingjay but anyone whos reading this should definitely buy the book tick tock (if you read the book you know what im getting at) AMAZING!!!!!

B005FISC52|5.0|\\"Someday is today, and someday is yesterday.\\" Two days have passed since this remarkable series has ended its run, and now that I've had time to mull over that sad fact, I've had time to mull over the quote above taken from the final episode. The former reminds me that the show is over and left for us longtime fans to relive on DVD and for the new fans to discover and to enjoy the delight that is One Tree Hill; the latter reminds me of the countless hours of my youth spent watching this show that has ever changed my life. Sounds like I'm exaggerating, right? A television show changing someone's life? Well, that's exactly the impact One Tree Hill had on me.<br /><br />Many may think that One Tree Hill is some hapless, teen drama that blows normalcy way out of proportion. But the series is so much more than that. Sure, there have been many plots that most of us may never relate to. A psycho posing as my half-brother is probably not in the cards for me, nor is a video exposing my goodies to the entire school very likely to occur in my lifetime. But, it's not about that delicious drama that drew us into this show. It kept us tuned in, but it's not what created a pseudo-connection between the show and the fans. It was the stories and life lessons that were presented for us. It was the stories and lessons about family and love, the stories and lessons about dreams, and the stories and lessons about hope. Because that's what One Tree Hill has always been about.  It's always been about family and love and dreams and hope; it was \\"the little show that could,\\" after all. And that's what made us fall in love with our favorite North Carolinians. And that's what sets this series apart from other television shows. Yes, there is the typical drama, but there's also a brand of storytelling like no other that's ever present.<br /><br />Every character is genius, especially my personal favorite Brooke. Without getting into too much gushing, I can say that I've learned a lot from Brooke Davis. I've learned that you can be more than what others have marked you as. You can change, and you can be successful, and you can have hopes and dreams. I can't say that about any other television character. And I praise Sophia Bush for delivering such a stellar and beautiful performance for 9 years. And I thank Mark Schwahn for thinking Peyton needed a best friend.<br /><br />One Tree Hill will always be special to me. It shaped my adolescence, it defined my music library, and it kept me entertained and hopeful for 9 years. This show has changed lives, and as I said, it's changed mine. That's something reserved for things that are truly remarkable and beautiful. I will miss tuning in on Wednesday nights (or Monday and Tuesday's) to watch these guys combat psycho stalkers and nannies, squabble about love triangles, and gather around the stage at Tric to watch musical acts. But, as Brooke said in the finale, the memories will always be in her heart. And that's where One Tree Hill and the memories it's given me will always be, in my heart. Always and forever.e Davis.

B007IUBU86|5.0|This was a real treat for me. I'm a Stone Sour, Black Label Society fan. I'm not much of a progressive rock fan with the exception of those songs from Dream Theater that bleed into the Heavy and Alternative Metal genre. I'm very excited about this album and hopefully will see more from Adrenaline Mob in the future.
B000I8G5C6|5.0|I loved this and I didn't think I would but my partner recommended it. I'm so glad I agreed to see it because I couldn't stop laughing and Will Smith is brilliant as Hitch. He should do more romantic comedies as he is a natural!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I bought this item thinking it was nice and lightweight.  It most definitely was but almost too thin and the stand did not work very well.  I ended up returning the item and buying the Marware Leather case instead.  That was a much better item for protection and stand use.
B001G7SS9G|5.0|Opening this box is like waking up on Christmas morning, it is filled with so many cool stuff you don't know where to begin!! The Postcards alone are so damn cool with their images of how all these famous landmarks would look like after the virus has decimated those famous cities. The 3D box with the action sequence between the Alpha Male and Robert Neville is very Very cool. And the book is just so well put together you don't want to ruin it with your greasy fingers LOL. And I haven't even gotten to the Movies yet. At this great low price it is a great gift or a welcomed addition to your DVD Collection. This is A Must Have !!

B004EPZ03Y|1.0|I'd never seen a Muppets movie before but I knew the characters from when I was younger.  Who would create a kids' movie with such a grown-up theme?  I really feel sorry for the actress, whose talent was well disguised in this movie.  This could quite possibly be the most idiodic kids' film I've ever seen.  From now on I'll choose more wisely.
0199267170|2.0|I purchased this thinking it would be great for my Shakespeare class.  It isn't.  The editors have made decision about the text that do not match with what seems to have been (right or wrong) standard.  Too difficult to follow along.  Has a pretty good introduction, but you can get this online and elsewhere.  Use Arden or Folger.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I purchased the Microshell Folio Cover by Marware for my Kindle Fire. It is the best I've seen. The Kindle Fire snaps right into it to make it secure, like it says it is light weight, not bulky at all. Overall design is exactly what I was looking for. After showing it to friends they also had placed an order  for one.
B0029LHWFO|3.0|This is not an autobiography. Not a memoir. It's a book you're assigned when you take a course on Africa to fulfill the Eastern Civilizations requirement for your degree. Part travelogue, part observation, 'White man confronts Africa' seems to be the idea. Obama discusses one he was assigned to read, 'Heart of Darkness', by Joseph Conrad. Amusingly, a book dedicated to the idea that whites and colonialism are an evil in the midst of Africa is now denounced as 'racist', against blacks. Don't they all say that, and aren't nearly all of them, 'black man returns to Africa' now? The late 70's being about the time, apparently, black students could believe what a black man had to say about Africa, and not assume he was listening to a puppet voice being controlled by a white man behind the scenes. Perhaps the people just demand 'authenticity'. What Obama thinks of books decrying the growing number of blacks colonizing other areas, or the growing number of people of color colonizing Europe, we don't know. If such a book were written it would likely be condemned and the authors possibly physically threatened. Not much is said about this reverse-colonialism of the more recent last 60 years or so.<br /><br />From the beginning of Dreams From My Father, to the end on page 429 where Obama writes, \\"I dropped to the ground and swept my hand across the smooth yellow tiles. Oh, father, I cried. There was no shame in your confusion. Just as there had been no shame in your father's before you. . . It was the silence that betrayed us\\" it's a work marketed to a university syllabus. Perhaps the publishers were simply going where the money is. As an additional benefit of having read Dreams From My Father, I now have an idea what it would be like if television's Mr Spock were ever to break down and cry.<br /><br />A fair amount of the book deals with race. When it begins there is a fair amount of irony. We're supposed to believe the imagined indignities Obama suffers in Hawaii, because of his race, are what white men must be going through now. Dreams From My Father quickly settles into the accepted narrative, however, that of minority suffering and white privilege, and takes this theme seriously, at least, till the end on page 429. . .? As it settled into the accepted narrative, reading, I was literally thinking, 'what kind of bizarre 1950's time warp' have I wandered into? About that time, Obama uses this line himself, on page 98 writing, \\"living in the same sixties time warp that Hawaii had created. . .\\".<br /><br />There's almost a formula to the book. Obama meets authentic or angry black people, he understands their 'suffering', their plight, and their viewpoint, understands it well, but he himself chooses a more conciliatory stance towards the larger world. He's just that big. I wasn't going to read to the end (but I did). Was going to end my review by saying something like, 'wake me up if anything changes', so it was amusing to me, when, as a community organizer in Chicago, he interacts with members of the Nation of Islam. Can't get any more angry or black than that. And Obama understands. There's also an unusual aspect to Obama's life, if I may say. Certainly an unprecedented one. He's a person of color, outside a corporate office, who is rewarded for taking a conciliatory stance towards the larger world.<br /><br />Working as a community organizer Obama meets a black kid who tells him, 'the air force would never let a black man fly a plane' on page 254. Obama tells him, \\"You can do whatever you want if you try and work for it\\". The kid smirks and says, \\"How many black pilots do you know?\\" ending the paragraph. I nearly laughed out loud, and would have, if it wasn't for curiosity as to what Obama's response might be. Obama is unable to give a response to the kid in what I can only assume is intended to be a weighty endorsement of the kid's gripe.  Without a doubt, I need some 'sensitivity' training, for my inappropriate laughter, yet there is aplaque on the moon with the name of a black astronaut, a man who would likely have set foot there if not killed in a training accident. If there were a space shuttle flying overhead (which we could look up to see if there was given the week this took place) no doubt it contained a black crewman. Was Obama helping write his own ticket with this emphasis on the kids gripe? Was he a made man at the date he wrote this book - already destined for a run at the presidency? The kid does have a point, I suppose, in either case, and perhaps Obama's non-response, which we're supposed to believe was his response, may have been the best one he could give. On a personal note, I voted for Obama simply because we've never had a black president before. It's surprising how very few people claim they did. I guess I can be a bit irresponsible with my vote.<br /><br />In at least one way Obama seems to have quietly brought his community activism to the White House with him. Citizens are now eligible for what is sometimes called an 'Obama phone'. I don't want to mischaraterize this book. . . Obama is a good observer, and, genuinely, has a way with words. He describes Kansas as a place where, \\"decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty\\". I lived in Kansas for a couple of years, and for whatever reason, never really liked it. I was never able to put my feeling into words. Obama explains it with apparent ease. Dreams From My Father is not nearly as good, in my opinion, as his 5 star effort 'The Audacity of Hope', yet there is something here. I'd heard all the words about 'transformational figure', etc, before, repeated many times, but it wasn't until reading Dreams From My Father that I felt it too. There is something here. Even though the majority of Obama's experiences take place outside the mainland US there's also something very American about Obama. Just as I had a loss for words earlier, I can't really explain what it is. If I were an extremist in the third world somewhere, railing against America's 'cultural hegemony', I might have more to fear from president Obama than outspoken president Bush.<br /><br />Much has been written, in admittedly small circles, that a sort of 'macho culture' is what is destroying American men (and tormenting black women). Here, I think, even though it is only apparent in the subtext, it appears this sort of 'keep a stiff upper lip' attitude is saving Obama. There seems a sort of self-sacrificing masculinity at play allowing Obama to do the right thing, or at least endure 'injustice'. I suppose the powers-that-be would be happy if it just keeps us working. I fear those more like Obama may be a dying breed. It's becoming more acceptable to be the kind of man Obama's Indonesian step father teaches him to be. His step father advises him that 'stronger men prey on weaker men' and urges him to be a strong man. I believe his step-father is sent off to some kind of a work camp sometime soon after. Work camps don't have a high pay scale.<br /><br />Much of the book is Obama growing up and learning to be a moral person. It's a constant sort of growing up process, self consciously improving ourselves. It's a process or battle that is doomed to failure, I think. The longer we fight the battle, however, the longer we try, the more pleasant at least things can be. It's a battle worth fighting, but in the end, unless we are devoutly religious, or become president of the United States, it's a battle we will ultimately lose. In the end we will do anything to advance our own interests, in this country that means we will do nearly anything for the right amount of money.<br /><br />The book touches, gently, on 'where we've gone wrong' or 'what's gone wrong'. At one point, and it's brought up kind of abruptly, we learn Obama's sister from Africa is in Germany with her white boyfriend. This information is sort of trotted out before us. Is this the solution? Well, I don't know, but it's certainly the solution for whites! - er, continental Europeans.<br /><br />In the intro Obama says some of the characters are 'composites of different people he has known'. There's also a character he meets in Africa, a Historian, who sounds like the wisest person on Earth. Judging from this book one would assume this is what is important, or at least that Obama's stance is what is important. If we just get the correct information out to the people, if we simply control what people learn, and the proper folks are in charge of that, and if this goes on for a long enough time, this is the solution. Personally, I don't think it is. In fact, I draw the exact opposite cause and effect! I don't even think 'president Obama' will be the solution.<br /><br />Though it touches on issues facing all of us, I'm not sure there are easy solutions offered in Dreams From My Father (other than the implied need for correct, right-thinking). If solutions are offered here, I didn't understand them. The conclusion might be, 'Life is hard. It's harder in Africa'.can't really explain what it is.

0439023513|3.0|I thought the first book was phenomenal and the second was a great set-up for a finale.  But, this third book had so many underdeveloped events, I was disappointed.  I wasn't attached to most of the characters in this book like I was in the first one.  I also didn't like a few of the outcomes--not because I wanted a bunnies and sunset ending but because I wanted consistency with the character's personalities and the struggles they experienced in the prior books.  With that said, if you've read the first two, of course this is a must read.  Just don't expect to feel strong emotions for the characters like you did in the first books.

B0072OFOM6|3.0|Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena were spectacular! Vengeance was disappointing.<br /><br />The season was cut from the expected 13 episodes to 10 episodes, which in my opinion, left it wanting. The writers were not able to develop new characters nor the complex story lines in such a short time frame. They integrated a backstory for Oenomaus with his fate right after the breakout, which was simply confusing and unnecessary in season 2. The intricate and complex relationship between Lucretia and Ilithyia was crammed in between murky battle scenes and never developed to the fullest. The new codependent relationship between Lucretia and Ashur was \\"explained\\" with a 5 second flashback, which was of no use to anyone (most of us) who had already figured out that Ashur was the only one who could have possibly saved her. The two characters, Sepia and Sepius were so undeveloped that one kept going, \\"Who? What? Which one is which? Why are they there?\\" up to the point of their demise. An incestual relationship between them was hinted at, but was never developed nor explained. In the last episode, deKnight killed off all of the delicious villains as well as some well-loved good guys, leaving his cast decimated (if I may use that word prior to Crassus being introduced). What we are left with is a rag-tag band of rebels, none of whom are terribly interesting as characters. It does not bode well for season 3, where I suspect the story will leave behind all the wonderful political and sexual intrigue and devolve to a bash and slash fest.<br /><br />On positive note, the one outstanding episode was number 5, which included intrigue, fighting and the spectacular burning of the arena. Yes, I was one of those screaming from my armchair. This episode was directed by Michael Hurst, which I suspect made it the spectacular piece it was. Unfortunately, he directed only this single episode this season.<br /><br />My only comment about the forced cast changes this season is the new actorshad big roles to fill and they did well considering the scripts they had to work with.<br /><br />Yes, I pre-ordered the Blu-ray for season 2. I doubt I will do so for season 3.

B005R4255C|5.0|I literally grew up with MJ's solo music... listened to \\"Thriller\\" before school every morning... fought the peer pressure to listen to Guns 'n Roses etc. and listened to \\"Bad\\" instead... \\"Dangerous\\" in middle school.  Like many casual fans, I let MJ's music fade in my mind as he became so reclusive and had such bad press, etc.  Also like many of us, his death re-ignited my interest... and, like many of us, I rediscovered the genius of the music and of the man.  All of that said, I enjoyed a ticket to \\"Immortal\\" as a gift to accompany a REAL fan (thanks, Mom!) and I loved the way they refreshed the music and the moments built into each of these songs.  As a whole, I think the album is tremendous, taking the essence of many of his huge songs and mixing them around a bit, although not nearly as drastically as George Martin et. al. did for The Beatles' \\"Love\\" album for that Cirque du Soleil production.  Truthfully, this plays a bit more like a greatest hits album, albeit with some cuts you may not find on a greatest hits album.  But it's also interspersed with sound bites and effects, yet is very listenable even if I had not seen the show, as opposed to many \\"soundtracks\\".  I think purists and \\"real fans\\" will enjoy this album as a creative endeavor that warrants the purchase, yet does not destroy the original music.  I think casual fans will love the moments this album presents in a fresh way that may be more interesting and fulfilling than, say, popping in \\"Essentials\\" or another compilation album.  Definitely worth a listen and a purchase; if the two-disc album is steep for you, check out the 1-disc, although I can't comment on it.  Also note, if you're looking at this in a real-life store as opposed to online, the outer sleeve of this album has an incomplete track listing!  Give it a shot!
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Who could have predicted that KoRn's tenth album would see the likes of Skrillex and Feed Me? Sure, KoRn has branched out before and collaborated with a variety of other musicians throughout their discography, but never before on a scale where the collaborations have influenced the direction of the entire album. After the band had returned back to their raw old-school roots from their debut album and Life Is Peachy days, it was a big, BIG surprise that their next album would reveal them making a 180° turn in the other direction.<br /><br />Electronic beats and wobbles grace The Path to Totality throughout, and as strange as a dubstep influenced KoRn album sounds, the band never sounds awkward with these producers alongside. For example, KoRn has always had a knack to be dark and groovy all at the same time, and that is accentuated even more so on many of the tracks here. Hard to believe? Just check out the opening to their third track, \\"My Wall\\" with Excision.<br /><br />Although the album may be a source for controversy among KoRn's fans (KoRn purists will no doubt cringe with digust at the band's choice of direction for this album), I'd dare say that many of the tracks on The Path of Totality stands with some of KoRn's best work. It also serves as another solid example that KoRn can blend elements from their own trademark metal and meld them in perfectly with those of other musicians, and balance both with steadiness. On The Path of Totality, KoRn does just so, not for one song, but a whole album.

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|They don't make music like this anymore, or so I thought until I discovered this band via \\"That Metal Show\\". Hughes, Bonomasa and the rest of the boys have crafted two amazing albums that sound right at home when listening to Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple.
0060873027|1.0|What begins somewhat promisingly quickly spirals into utter nonsense with dialogue that occasionally made me laugh out loud -- though that was far from the author's intent. Cardboard characters repeatedly do assinine things including supporting one of their \\"team\\" who any sentient being would have jettisoned early on.  I grudgingly give it one star for imagination and a scientific orientation when, when not laughably over the top, does contain some information about insects and occasionally offers a pseudo-possible view from the eyes of insect-sized humans. But repeatedly, I kept realizing I would have given this at least three stars if I'd read it as a 9-year old. It should be marketed as a book for children (though a bit graphically brutal), not for adults.
B00542USJW|5.0|I clearly remember watching this many years ago in the theater with several friends, and it's still fun to watch all these years later. The acting is bad, but thats forgivable.
1595825045|5.0|This extensive book is a must not only for fans of the animated series but for anyone with an appreciation for artistic practices. The skill and time dedicated into creating the animated series is well reflected in this journal, with an excellent layout and beautiful page spreads of conceptual arts not only is it a must have item, it contains very informative accompanying text that give a real background on the design and development of the project. The pages are thick and good quality with a glossy finish and the hardback cover will take a beating, (although this is a book you will want to preserve for a long time to come, i wouldnt recommend throwing it under a truck)It is clear that the developers of this series are passionate about their work and are enthusiastic in sharing their journey with you. The sketches and conceptual arts, designs and architecture drawings are of a quality and uniqueness you will not find else ware and the character development sections really discussed in depth the motivations and inspirations for their creation. This book is an inspirational read for anyone and well worth more than the cost.
B002OT731E|5.0|Since I don't think it's possible for the stones to make a bad album, I'm probably the wrong person who's review to trust. Needless to say I think this merits a purchase for any fan of the band.

B004LWZW7O|2.0|The premise is interesting and so much could have been done here. The cast is pretty good.  Timberlake is a relatively weak link...he's a basically competent actor, but just surrounded by better ones, including Cillian Murphy and Amanda Seyfried. And, we've seen better performances from Timberlake (The Social Network, most notably)  The problem here is the constant flow of cliches and standard action movie moments. There are all kinds of logical problems and plot improbabilities.  I guess there a little bit of popcorn value, I guess, (including a bunch of pretty cool futuristic/retro cars) but not enough to make it worth your while.

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I wrote off Demi Lovoto far before I ever heard a single song from her merely because she was a Disney Channel refuge and she just seemed like the type of artist that was too cure for her own good.  Them a few months ago I happened to hear `Skyscraper' while out to dinner and was taken aback by the fact that such a beautifully constructed ballad was the result of this young `troubled' artist.<br /><br />I dove into this album with reckless abandon and happen to listen to this FAR too much.<br /><br />Some have already noted that the album does not open on its strongest foot.  The seemingly obligatory club tracks that litter the first few tracks on the album are decent enough but nothing spectacular.  I happen to like the feel to `You're My Only Shorty', even if the lyrical content is rather simplistic and shortsighted, and the opening `All Night Long' is certainly on the top of its game when you consider the genre it dwells in.  As much as I hate Justin Derulo, and I think his contribution to `Together' is minimal, I must admit that it is with that track that this album really picks itself.<br /><br />`Lightweight' is a beautiful benchmark in the true uplift of this album.<br /><br />With `Lightweight', Lovoto begins crafted a perfectly balanced album.  Even the tracks that don't work completely thrive under the direction she took herself here.  `Fix a Heart' is subtle and moving in it's musical simplicity, but Demi's vocals cut through that like a knife.  `Skyscraper' is still my favorite track on the album.  I'm literally obsessed with this song.  It is just so emotionally compacted, exploding with such genuine insight and heartbreak.  It rises and falls in all the right places, and while the Wizz Dumb Remix isn't anything universally different, it still serves as a great addition to the album.  `For the Love of a Daughter' is another track that shatters emotionally.  It really feels ingrained in Demi, a heartbreaking reality that she delivers with emotional fluidity.<br /><br />Song like `Unbroken' and `Hold Up' handle the pop aspect of the album with sharp delivery, and `Mistake' balances both up-tempo and ballad qualities effortlessly.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really, really good album.  Despite a shaky start (those first three tracks are far from bad, they just don't feel genuine to this artist) this transforms into one of the more well-rounded and beautifully crafted albums I've heard in quite a while.ity.<br /><br />Song like `Unbroken' and `Hold Up' handle the pop aspect of the album with sharp delivery, and `Mistake' balances both up-tempo and ballad qualities effortlessly.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really, really good album.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This hard shell case is great for the working man on the go. The Kindle Fire is simple to install in this tough little case, and the stand is great and simple to use. This case is slim and compact, yet it provides an extra measure of protection, while keeping the accessory plugs free and clear for use. I highly recommend this 'Fire' case!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is great. You don't even need to buy the paid version to get good quality. A lot of people have said that the snooze button is too big so the off button is barely visible but if you go into the settings you can change your snooze method and how big the off button is. Best alarm app for the kindle by far.
0307477479|5.0|I've heard so much about this book, ever since it was published (2010).  I finally got to read it when my book club selected it recently.  The book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2011, but that doesn't automatically mean it's a great book (or that you'll like it).  However, I really loved this book.  There was a draw in that the book is very music-central, and punk rock to boot (my all-time favorite).  But you do not need to be a music lover, or know anything about punk, to dig this book.<br /><br />The book revolves around several characters, Bennie, a music exec, and Sasha, his assistant.  There's a pretty big cast of characters, and all in some way relate to Bennie and/or Sasha.  The chapters are each from a different character's perspective, and they do jump around in time.  The story was a little confusing at times because of this.  Sometimes it was tough to figure out which chapters were from which character's perspective.  However, I still found the book to flow really well.<br /><br />The book follows the characters as they grow older, and time has not necessarily been kind.  The chapters do sort of feel like short stories, but they all certainly go together and in the end it's fun to think back and figure out how they all relate.  I think it would be a good book to re-read for this reason.  I guess if I'm already thinking about re-reading that's a good sign!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always been a King fan but he had gotten away from drawing me in to his story telling.  Well, he's drawn me into this one and I felt like I was right beside these characters.  I had to force myself to stop reading just so I could go to work or to sleep!  I read each page with anticipation on how the world would be without Kennedy's assassination.  With King's version, it's not a pleasant place.  With true King style, he leaves you thinking, \\"what if?\\".  This is one book that I really couldn't put down and I miss the characters now that I've finshed.
0316098329|4.0|Room is an amazing book! If you have a great imagination it's quite easy to follow. The book is in the perspective and written as a little kid unlike most books so the words are not exactly complete and easy to follow for thoes who have a straight non kid imagination. This book really helped me into thinking how a little kid thinks because really as we get older we forget how it was to think as a kid, but Room is inspiring. A young boy and a 18 year old mother.. The kid born into the room not knowing anything about the outside world other than television in which he just thinks its all fake, that theres no outside world. Its amazing to see his mind and how it works after they escape after 5 years of him living in Room! Great story! Deffinitally one i would recomend other people to read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A great game to pass time during trips.  I have a kindle fire and it downloaded and works just fine so I don't really know whaat people were talking about not being able to download.  I haven't upgraded it and probably won't after reading all of the reviews.
0439023513|5.0|MOCKINGJAY is really an amazing yet different book. Unlike the first two books (Hunger Games and Catching Fire) Mockingjay takes place in the underground district 13 instead of the games where they really dont have much food in district 13, pretty much eating tiny bowls bland of soup everyday. But its full of action, suspence, horror, and romance.. If your into all that, which I am. I would read the whole series again, expecially the 3rd book. Its full of mutated creatures, memmories, a hidden love, and a lot of fighting. The mockingjay; Katness Everdeen, faces many obsticals that are both heartbreaking and couragios. Deffinitally on your toes kind of read, something around every corner. Great book, read it!

B00340ESIS|4.0|\\"Save the Cat\\" is a very useful and practical checklist of the things that need to be there for your screenplay to work. Your brilliance and originality still need to be added and the author makes that clear. But this book steers you away from a lot of common writing pitfalls, and offers some tests (and some \\"tricks\\") to make sure the right ingredients are in the mix. Use the book's tricks and techniques in a cheesy or hackish manner and you'll get a cheesy, hackish product. But, bottom line, \\"STC\\" is an excellent point of reference to check in with while writing a screenplay. It zeroes in on the important stuff without wading through a lot of theory and background. This book alone can't make you talented or original. But, used properly, it can help make sure that your script is a \\"good read\\" and will increase your chances that someone might think that what you've written is a movie.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I've been a fan of this series for several years, and I was definitely reluctant when I heard that it was being made into a TV show.  However, this adaption has to be one of the best books to screen adaptions ever.  The casting is fantastic.  In fact, when I read the books now I picture these actors in my mind.  The cinemetography, ambiance, music, etc. are all equally top notch.  If you enjoy Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, or any other fantasy series, do yourself a favor and check out Game of Thrones.  (Read the books first!)
1612130283|4.0|I read the first novel with interest and enjoyed it quite a lot. I am not a Twilight fan, nor have I ever read Twilight Fan Fiction. But I do love a bit of kink in my romance and so I looked forward to FSOG. For the most part, it succeeded. My problem was with Ana, who I found to be bland but beautiful. Lacking substance. I guess that made her perfect as a blank canvas for Christian to write his kink onto. Even her little shows of feistyness didn't win me over. And her asides (holy cow!) at the most inappropriate times ruined the mood on many occasions. But Christian is a great character, well-written, and holy cow! is he smoking hot. I read the second instalment in the series, but I am not as enthusiastic to read the next. Once you get past the first few smoking hot sex scenes, they, like real life, get a bit mundane. There are only so many times I can read \\"my blood sang in my veins\\" before it becomes comic. Still, I enjoyed it all in all. I felt in the second novel that it was too much Sex in the City with the focus on Christian's wealth. I am not interested in all those events and sidelines. I was more interested in seeing Christian struggle with his sexuality and identity. I would have liked Ana to be more three dimensional, and be interesting as a character instead of this just another pretty face wide-eyed innocent. Plus I really didn't believe the virgin who never, you know, did it to herself. Where is she living -- Saudi Arabia? Sheesh. Still, I bought the first two novels. Could they have been better? Yes. Did I enjoy them? Yes. WIll I go see the movie? Yes. And i will probably break down and buy the third novel, just so I know how it all turns out. Let me guess - with Christian redeemed and no longer a self-loathing sadist, Ana happily married, preggers and living in a huge mansion -- a mommy-porn happily-ever-after fairy tale!
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|Happy Feet Two is a great movie.  It has everything, just like the first one.  It is cute, there is good music, dancing, action, love, it's funny and has a good message.  I don't understand all the negative reviews because this movie is GREAT!!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|George Martin, as a former screenwriter himself, had said some years ago that it would be hard to make a movie out of \\"Game of Thrones.\\"  Well, it turned out to be entirely possible to make a 10-hour HBO series that stayed remarkably true to the book.<br /><br />Interestingly, every episode had at least one scene that wasn't in the book--except for the one episode Martin wrote himself!  This is because the book stays with about half a dozen point-of-view characters, and some of the more intriguing characters, like Littlefinger, appear only when seen by others.  The shows, however, introduce scenes where Littlefinger and similar figures are seen without any Starks or Lannisters.  And yet with very few exceptions these \\"bonus\\" scenes work just fine, showing what Martin implies was going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />The acting is terrific.  Although they cast everyone a little older than in the book (Robb looks more 18 than 14, Dany more 16 than 13), you can really believe in the characters.  The scripts manage to include everything one would consider essential in the book.<br /><br />As a result, the books have leaped back onto the best seller lists for the past year and seem likely to stay there.  Anything that makes people read long, complex works of literature must be applauded!  For those seeing the shows first and startled at how Martin kills off his characters, prepare yourself as you read further into the series; you ain't seen nothing yet.
B0012TWRAO|3.0|I bought a RAM setup so that I could mount my phone to my Yamaha Stryker and use the GPS feature to explore. The rest of the products I received are great but I've got one major problem with this Zinc Coated U-Bolt. Within two days of being mounted to my bike I started seeing rust come through the zinc coating. I will say that it does grip the handlebar tightly and I have all the confidence that it will stay where I put it. I love the setup and I hope this rust issue doesn't affect the longevity of the system.

0525423281|5.0|I loved Anna and the French Kiss, so I really had high hopes for this one.  I was keeping my fingers crossed that Stephanie's sophomore book would deliver.  I'm happy to say it did!<br /><br />At first, I wasn't sure what to think of Lola.  She's so different from any other character I've read, and such a drastic change from Anna.  I also didn't identify with her as much.  I don't have that artistic flair and tend to prefer to go with the flow not stand out in the crowd.  But, slowly that characteristic really began to grow on me.  She's everything I'm not, and I really admired that about her.  I also admired the fact that she's a typical teen.  With things begin to snowball, she questions who she really is.  But, she soon realized that being who you are doesn't always mean fitting to everyone else's standards.  A nice change of pace is that Lola is being raised by her two dads, who are really her biological uncle and his partner.  Her mother occasionally comes in and reeks havoc in her life.<br /><br />I liked Cricket from the first time we meet him.  I love how it seems like he just appears were ever Lola is.  Some of it is coincidental, but other times you can tell he's making a valiant effort to reconnect with Lola.  I enjoyed his personality.  He's like a combination of nerdy mixed with a couple other \\"types\\", it's no wonder that Lola is so attracted to him.  I found ironic that Lola never flat out told him that she had a boyfriend.  It's not something I really faulted her on, because I could tell she was really struggling with her feeling concerning Cricket.<br /><br />It's funny how a book can twist around how you feel about things.  I was prepared to dislike Calliope (Cricket's sister) and I did for part of the book.  But, she really comes through in the end.  I admired how the how family has backed her in her dreams.  I think the fact that Cricket has put some much of his life on hold for her shows a sense of who he is and what's important to him.  I also really liked Max at first, despite their age difference.  In the end, I couldn't believe that he acted that way he did to Lola.  But, maybe he was really hurt by her actions and this was his only way of expressing it.<br /><br />In the end, I decided that Lola was just as fantastic as Anna, but in an entirely different way.  I'm amazed that Stephanie has managed to write two completely different heroines and their romances.  I can't wait to read her next one!eally liked Max at first, despite their age difference.

006197806X|4.0|I felt like I had to sit and think about this book for quite awhile.  It was a good follow up to Delirium.  It was well above how I usually feel for the second, but it had a different feel than the first novel.<br /><br />I had the most trouble with the different time periods.  I'm horrible at reading chapter titles and it took me awhile to get use to how the novel was set up.  It felt choppy because I kept wondering how Lena got to be back in society.  I knew the story would get to it eventually, it just bugged me for some reason.  I think it would have worked just fine in a normal time line.  Was Delirium set up the same way? (I honestly can't remember.)<br /><br />Lena shows some admirable characteristics when meet her in the wild.  She's injured, near death, and has lost Alex.  I think it's hard for her at first to pick up the pieces, she needs that push.  No one in the Wild can shirk his/her duties.  I liked that they gave her time to come to terms with what's happened to her, but know when she needs the push to move on.  I liked how Lena finds her place in this little band of outsiders.  When she finds what she wants to do in this group she pushed for it.<br />I liked the pacing of the actions while they are infiltrating the city.  I like how the don't tell Lena the whole story.  I think it was necessary for her to go in blindly even though she doesn't like it in the end.  I loved Lena's interactions with Julian.  I liked that he was able to see the other side of things.  Such a blow to his dad and the people he is connected to.  I'm curious as to how this will effect society's view on the \\"illness\\".<br /><br />I was kind of disappointed in the ending.  I had been expecting it all along.  But, I really wanted it much sooner in the book.  I think it's kind of a blow to the storyline and to Lena's character to have it happen on the last pages.  It was one of those things that made me think about giving it a lower rating.  But, after much consideration, I kept it were I originally had planned.<br /><br />A worthy addition to the series.  Still think it has some characteristics of the Pretty series, but it's beginning to take a life of it's own.

I missed episode one, but as I'm a prime member, I was able to watch it for free, and get caught up.<br /><br />It was great to be able to watch the story straight through, without pause, and without commercials. I was most definitely trapped by the show. I 100% agree with the Emmy it won, and can't understand why it didn't win more!<br /><br />Now I have to agonize over a week, for season 2, until the next episode. I only wish i could get it all at once. And, it pains me to say, this, single show, WILL cause me to be an HBO subscriber. (And I own a DVD rental business.) HBo has Ricky Gervais, Real Sex, and Bill Mahrer as well, so, I don't feel so bad, subscribing for just the one show. (But I would.)<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, be entertained. Buy Game of thrones, catch up, and start watching the new season.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! its very addicting. I cant ever put it down<br />, because I have to just unlock 'one more'.

B006CC0YB0|5.0|Have albums with Mark Lanegan in collaboration with Isobel Campbell and as one of the Gutter Twins. So good to hear him on his own. The gravelly voice is so suited to the blues and if you're into that sort of music then buy this album.
B0063IH60K|4.0|So far this seems to be a good app. The ads are not to annoying to me &amp; besides it was free.
1933492953|5.0|This book is the most helpful piece of instructional literature I've ever purchased by far. Do yourself a favor and buy it. I paid $24.99 for mine and it was worth every cent. I'm 75% done with it and I can't see myself NOT going back to it over and over again.<br /><br />Thanks to all who posted their positive reviews of Framed Ink and moved my hand to buy it!

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I tried them with the converter to my iPad and also on the microphone jack on my laptop, with new batteries and batteries placed opposite the diagram on the product. Now Amazon tells me I might only receive a partial refund. How about sending me two that work?
B00792EGES|5.0|Alter Bridge are definitely one of the best bands of the past 10 years and this new Live At Wembley DVD proves that they are talented musicians who thrive on the live experience. This package includes an amazing concert containing 21 songs from all three of their albums plus a DVD documentary with lots of backstage footage and a bonus CD of the live concert. The band is on fire during this show as they play with passion and intensity while the production is also killer featuring a nice light show and crystal clear footage of all band members and their musicianship. Alter Bridge is that rare type of band that has musical talent, quality songs, and the ability to produce it all live on stage. Highlights include the powerful opening track \\"Slip To The Void\\", the brilliant vocal melodies of \\"Ghosts Of Days Gone By\\", the amazing performance of \\"Blackbird\\", the heartfelt acoustic performance of \\"Watch Over You\\", and the stunning hard rocker \\"Isolation\\". I recently saw Alter Bridge perform in Australia and I can tell you it was a very intense show that highlighted the twin guitar attack of a great band and their awesome singer. This is an essential concert for fans of Alter Bridge and is a reward to fans who have supported this band's steady climb to the top of the rock ladder.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|First I'll start out by saying that I have given this movie the full five stars because I feel I appreciated this movie more than most. I watch Ghost Adventures and this movie was unmistakeably a mockup of that show.<br /><br />I have to say the beginning was kind of long and draw out and they definitely could have cut out at least 15 minutes but when they started exploring the hospital, it started getting crazy. I would have to say that this movie had more twists, dark moments and scares than the first two paranormal activities and the blair witch project combined.<br /><br />Overall it was a good scary movie which will be a good part of my Halloween movies list.
B007I0WWEW|4.0|Travelling is the new album from Swedish power pop rockers Roxette following on from the massively successful world tour of their previous album Charm School. This album is a collection of songs written and recorded in various studios along their world tour and as such contains a very eclectic mix of song styles and production techniques. The sound is much more organic with less production tricks and a more retro vibe overall. Per Gessle's songwriting genius is on full display and Marie Fredriksson is singing great as always. Highlights include the catchy chorus of \\"Me & You & Terry & Julie\\", the Beatles vibe of \\"Lover Lover Lover\\", the classic Roxette melodies and refrains of \\"Turn Of The Tide\\", the party rocker \\"Touched By The Hand Of God\\", the mellow version of \\"Perfect Excuse\\" from Per's solo album Party Crasher, and the gorgeous ballad \\"Angel Passing\\". There are also a couple of bonus tracks including an alternate rocking live version of \\"Stars\\" from the Have A Nice Day album, a great live version of \\"She's Got Nothing On (But The Radio)\\" from Charm School, and a live version of their 25 year old hit \\"It Must Have Been Love\\" featuring an orchestra. Despite not being as focused as their previous masterpiece Charm School, Travelling is a great sequel to Tourism from the masters of power pop and is highly recommended to all fans of Roxette especially if you are into Per Gessle's amazing solo career - 4.5 stars.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like the way it makes you think. You think you have the puzzle solved and a new obstacle is introduced. You navy to look at it another way. Great for critical thinking skills. I'm going to let my kids at school play with it.
B00729Z6R4|5.0|Swedish powerhouse rockers H.E.A.T. return with Address The Nation which is their third amazing album in a row. It was hard to predict what would happen to H.E.A.T. following the decision to change singers to Erik Gronwall who won Swedish Idol in 2009 but this new album leaves no doubt that their amazing run of albums will continue. The music is rock, the production is massive, the performances are stellar, and the vibe of the album screams classic. From beginning to end this is a high quality rock album that focuses on memorable choruses and lots of great guitar playing very much in the style of Bon Jovi's early classic albums Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. Highlights are many but include the hook filled vocals and massive chorus of \\"Living On The Run\\", the brilliant pre chorus and synth solo of \\"Better Off Alone\\", the huge power ballad \\"The One And Only\\", the memorable chorus of \\"Falling Down\\", the layered backing vocals of \\"Heartbreaker\\", and the nostalgic sax solos and pure melodic rock magic of \\"In And Out Of Trouble\\". Address The Nation is yet another superb album by H.E.A.T. that will definitely be a top 5 album for the year and is highly recommended to fans of other quality bands such as Treat, Coldspell, Leverage, and Brother Firetribe.
0307959856|2.0|I put this book on my Wish List after hearing an interview of the author on NPR. My husband very sweetly bought it for me for Christmas, and I tried not to let him know that it was nowhere near as good as I had expected...<br /><br />Ms. James reiterates so much of the original Pride and Prejudice prose that you would think she expected readers that had not read P&P to be reading this - I don't know why. And with such homage to the original, you would think she might manage a good imitation of Austen's style. But no. Unlike Austen, she does not break up her long, high-level descriptive passages with actual dialogue and action. And Elizabeth has gotten boringly conventional with marriage.<br /><br />The author is also so very careful not to offend a reader that she cannot bear to either kill or convict anyone that might matter to said reader.<br /><br />These two points together add up to a rather dull read. It's too bad. I had hoped for better.
B004GYY714|2.0|Great app on my  iPod Touch. Not so great on Kindle Fire because there is no way to adjust volume.
B0000013G9|4.0|I really didnt get the album but I seen thr concert. It was very cool I loved the metallic voice.

B004XDYJRU|3.0|I've had Tunein radio on my iPod touch for a long time and really like it. I put it on my new Kindle Fire, and I can't find a volume bar. I've looked and swiped everywhere on the screen and nothing shows up. If not for that, I would give it 5 stars.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|When it comes to cables - they work, or they don't work the way they should.  These cables are strong and durable, and the connectors are solid as well.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|When I asked my friend how this book was, she said it was kind of like Orwell's 1984. It's my fault for not asking \\"what does that really mean.\\" This book could only dream to have the depth, drama, language, philosophy, and emotion of Orwell's 1984. This book's only selling point is the elementary desire in every one of us to know how the story ends. That desire alone will keep you reading.<br /><br />I was bored by most of the dialogue in the book and found myself skipping paragraphs just to learn how the story ended. This book reminded me why I usually don't read fiction. To do fiction well one must be en excellent writer, and have a fertile mind for imagination.<br /><br />Although you might have never read this book, in reality you have. That sentence makes sense to those who have read the book.

B004ZNARH4|5.0|This is one of the greatest things Pink Floyd has put out for their die hard fans! The DSOTM Immersion Box Set is stellar. The black marbles have a little prism on them and I do know about marbles. These are your striker marbles in that game. Awesome! They also have a little black pouch. The scarf is great to wear to soccer games. I like how the coasters spell out PINK FLOYD. A white sheet of paper written on both sides is by Roger Waters and it explains the questions he asks people when he put it on DSOTM.Very great reproduction! There is also art and rare photos of the band and reproductions of a concert ticket and backstage pass. There are 6 CDs/DVDs. One has Roger doing his rendition of Money. Also there is a Bluray DVD of a Floyd concert. There are also rare outakes and different versions of DSOTM songs. I'm thrilled to own this collectable Immersion Box Set! Five stars!
6305736650|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it, as a kid.  Now that I own it I watch it a couple times a year.  If you are old enough to remember WWII, this movie is a must.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have to say.. I read the first book and it mildly entertained me.  I got the second book for some form of closure.  I must say I loved the second book!  I found it much better than the first book.  That being \\"said\\" I did not care for the \\"sexcapades\\" and I am completely tired of the Denna character.  I understand how some readers feel in regards to progression and I agree that it didn't quite give us a lot of answers but enough to keep me enjoying the story.  I am excited for book 3!

You're gonna be shaking your head at the absurdity of their relationship and their actions but that's their type of love.

I have the digital enhanced version for kindle and it is amazing how well it is structured. If you are looking for serious long Term commitment to drawing and do not feel that everything you create must be a finished work of art in An hour or less then this is an essential book for you. And check out the kindle edition. It isnot just an ebook.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I discovered A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs at 13 yrs old when it was the selection of the month in the Science Fiction Book Club (which I had finally been allowed to join). I couldn't put it down and by the end had (just like John Carter) fallen completely in love with the incomparable Dejah Thoris, a smart and beautiful woman who was also a Princess of the Barsoomian (Martian) city of Helium. In my eyes, the only man worthy of her was the heroic John Carter, a Virginia gentleman who had been a Confederate soldier in the Civil War. The movie John Carter is the Disney produced motion picture adaptation of A Princess of Mars. Many people don't realize that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his stories in the early 1900's. They were published in a form that was affordable to the masses and became enormously popular. His books were the epitome of pulp fiction and were churned out fairly rapidly. Bottom line, they were not meant to be high literature but basically fast moving action/adventure stories set in exotic locations. In those days you couldn't get any more exotic than Mars, which many thought was (or had been) inhabited. On top of that, Burroughs wrote a love story that not only spanned space and time, but also worlds and cultures.<br /><br />In this day and age none of those things are new or groundbreaking for a Science Fiction movie. But a great love story with action and adventure, mystery and heroism, plus cutting edge visual effects along with an assortment of aliens and alien creatures ranging from cute (JC's \\"Martian dog\\" Woola) to ferocious (the giant white apes of Barsoom) has something for every fan of SF cinema not just lovers of the book. I've read all sorts of typical criticisms whining about a lack of character development, wooden acting, and a difficult to understand plot. Well excuse me, but I remember another movie awhile back about which the same things were said but nobody paid any attention and checked it out anyway. Of course I'm talking about The Matrix. I'm not saying the two movies are alike in any way other than the way they were criticized and that they both deserve to be seen. John Carter has a lot more in common with Conan the Barbarian than a dark high tech mind-blower. But it is a lot of fun seeing the huge, green, 4armed warrior Tars Tarkus gain admiration for a smaller weaker looking man from earth perform feats that are just as unimaginable on Mars as they would be on Earth. I thought the movie was paced well and never bored me. I thought the book was well adapted and the changes that were made didn't really bother me at all. Look folks, it's SF written a century ago that still holds up and was so far ahead of its time that it took until now to do it justice on the big screen. I thought it was great and don't understand at all why John Carter hasn't cleaned up at the box office. Maybe the timing wasn't right for this type of movie, but it sure wasn't the movie's fault. It rocked in every way that it needed to. I'll definitely be buying the Blu Ray when it comes out.ng about The Matrix.

B006YZOXHQ|1.0|My understanding is Paramount is going to give us another 98 min. PG cut . Please give us the original complete uncut film !!!!!!!!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I just finished watching it and I have to say that this is the best movie I've seen in a while! Lots of action, great characters (talking about the apes) and enthralling story. I was a bit disappointed that we don't see how they take over totally but the seeds were planted and it was a great start! I have teared up more times than I would like. I felt for every ape and not because they were apes but because they did a really good job in making us feel for them and their desire felt real.<br /><br />This movie is great! Rent it!
1451627289|5.0|One of THE  best books my husband and I have ever read.  Jake Epping/George Amberson's journey back in time to undo wrongs is so realistic.  We felt like we were there.  It was a totally absorbing story.  When finished could only say Wow!  Yes, it is long but it so worthy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The premise: A sadly derivative attempt to cast Bachman's (King's) creepy and magnificent [[ASIN:B002SAUCBC The Long Walk]] into the era of Reality TV; instead of getting voted off the island, they kill each other for the delight of the debauched viewers. Yawn. The protagonist is a teen girl (chick-lit... check) in a post-apocalyptic (future-fiction... check) world of oppression and want (depression-vibe... check) who feeds her family by hunting illegally (teen-empowerment, defiance, girl-power AND self-reliance... checkmate). It sounded like a rundown of current publishing trends - all that were missing were werewolves and tattoos. Wait - The Capital people all have tatts and body-mods. Sigh. Check. It seemed more formulaic than Tums and about as appealing.<br /><br />I have rarely been more wrong, and more happy to BE wrong. Collins has a fresh and compelling voice and a brilliant sense of when and where to foreshadow or reveal. Some of the twists are a bit transparent, but the characters are rich and constantly evolve throughout the novel. Her use of the unexpected and the tight, taut pace she sets drags you into the world in a way few current authors manage. Her portrayals of Peeta and Gale skirt the edge of harlequin-hero but always veer sharply back to rock-solid character development just shy of it. These, along with Haymitch, are not flimsy set-piece guys for the teen-chick to pine over; they are as self-motivated and complex as Katniss herself - something exceedingly rare in books with teen female leads.<br /><br />The heroine is complicated and compelling. The visually-rich landscape created in each scene is gripping and vivid - to the point I really hate that there is a movie coming to ruin my inner vision of Katniss' world. When I was within 500 Kindle locations (a few hours reading) of the end, I literally could not turn off the Kindle. I look forward to devouring the rest of the series (I am halfway through Catching Fire) and whatever new dish Collinscooks up for her next venture. I am confident it will be quite a ride.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This review is aimed at the adult asking the question \\"is The Hunger Games for adult readers?\\"  To be clear the book is listed as being for children and young adults so rating this book for an adult audience isn't really fair.  That said and enough people have asked this question, including myself, that I thought I should review it from that perspective.  If I think back to my teen years I am quite sure I would have rated this book much higher.  So, if you are in that target demographic I'd say you can ignore the rest of the review and go ahead and start reading.  If, however, you are an adult then this review is for you.<br /><br />The best one word description I can use to describe this book is \\"shallow\\".  Going for two words and I'd say \\"one dimensional\\".  As an adult reader the concepts in this book are not shocking in the same way that they would play to a younger audience.  Life experiences and many more years of reading and movie watching having gotten us to a point where life and death itself isn't enough to keep us going.  If this book were written for adults it would have included substantially more information and backstory on the characters, the locations, the politics, etc.  The event itself as portrayed in this book would have been wrapped around a significant effort to make us feel what it would be like living in this world.  Motivations would have been explored, events creating and shaping the world would have been explored, and certainly a semblance of who these characters are (good and bad) would have been explored.  Yet what we actually get is entirely flat lacking any nuance, perspective, or depth required to make the events come alive.  Viewed from a single point and perhaps it looks pretty, but once you move your head from side to side or start walking left or right, you realize that only the facade exists being propped up by simple 2X4's.  There are events that I have heard younger readers express real emotion towards; however, when I reachedthose moments I didn't blink.  Why?  Because there was so little building to it and so little invested that it simply had no resonance.  An event itself isn't enough; we need context and depth of character in order to bring about any real emotional response.<br /><br />I don't think The Hunger Games has any cringe worthy teenage moments such as you might find in other books targeted at this demographic.  You probably won't roll your eyes too many times.  Yet, you won't remember this book shortly after putting it away.  It is very much like those cable moves that feature a template experience which is surrounded by \\"B\\" level actors.  These are ones where an earthquake threatens the world, a tornado threatens the world, a wave threatens the world, a volcano threatens the world, a meteor threatens the world, etc.  Perhaps it is a dreary weekend afternoon or you are home ill and you tune in just to pass the time and be mildly entertained.  Once it is over you are hard pressed to remember much outside of the main theme and days/weeks later you generally forget you even saw it.  Frankly this isn't too far away from The Hunger Games.  Quick mildly entertaining read with no compelling staying power because there isn't much there.<br /><br />Is the Hunger Games for adults?  Obviously from the above you can guess my answer.  It would certainly be no crime or embarrassment for an adult to read the book, just understand it wasn't meant for you.  It is not going to have the same resonance nor was it intended to.  I personally don't have any intention of reading the other two books, but who knows, perhaps one dreary Saturday afternoon I will be in the mood for a cable movie in book form...
B005PW3OS8|4.0|I did not purchase this in HD, but the quality was superb.The movie was good ahnd 48 hrs is more than enough time to watch it.<br />Thanks Amazon! Will definitely rent more in the future. In fact I have cancelled Netflix and switched to Amazon Prime, just makes more sense.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a wonderful game and the only downside are the ads that pop up before the game. But hey, it's free, what can you do??
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|Like Polanski's Frantic, this is another thriller of his that I think is highly underrated.  Both have very moody depictions of a dangerous Europe, and are very effective beyond their plot and screenplay.  Frantic is better - tense and intricate - but the Ninth Gate is still pretty great.  It's not a horror movie - very much closer to Indiana Jones or The DaVinci Code.  Sumptuous and shady.  But it does suffer from two major faults.  First is Polanski's characteristic black humor.  From some rather goofy characters to some jarringly silly moments, like when Langella murders Olin and then spooks the congregation, it's Polanski's peculiar touch but here really undermines what could have been a tense dark movie.  The second major problem is just the overblown ending - secret societies in costumes, rituals to conjure Satan - it all tops a serious and sinister thriller with overblown hokum.  But a fun movie, and a beautiful one to watch.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After countless months of hearing about the Hunger Game, I became curious to see whether or not the hype was all that it was cracked up to be. I read the book the day before I was about to see the movie. I didn't expect to completely finish the book, but I did. Let me tell you, this is a book that you just cannot stop reading. I stayed up till 4a.m. just to finish the ending.<br />Oh, by the way, I thought the movie was a let down.<br /><br />What I liked about the book was that the love story wasn't the main focus for the book. The capitol's cruel maltreatment towards it's people was the main focus. I love books that convey a sense of helplessness to one's environment/ situation in life, yet finding some way to screw with the system to get a supposedly fair and just democracy. (my favorite book is the Invisible Man by Ellison). In these types of books you always have the main character as this smart, yet naive young adult who thinks the world is exactly how they see it. They do not see that they are simply just a chess piece in another person's game. In Hunger Games, this is Katniss. Katniss is a 16 year old girl who volunteers to compete in the game in place of her sister. Katniss is incapable of loving and sharing her world with another person besides her sister. This cold approach to the world manages to be her biggest asset in the game. Without seeing the other competitors as people she could be friends with let alone relate to, she is able to stay focused in the game to what is important: staying alive for her sister. She is able to pick up on the system Haymitch has developed for her to get gifts from sponsors. A kiss meant you get soup.<br /><br />I don't know exactly why, but my favorite character from the whole series is Haymitch. Even though he is always in the background of these games, you can't help but feel as though he is always steps ahead of all the people that surround him. He drinks because of his knowledge of how the capitol works and his inability to do anything about it. He is a lot like Katniss. He doesn't let others into his world in fear that the capital would have something to use against him in case he acts out of line.<br /><br />When I think of the Hunger Games, I can't shake the deep presence of how the Greek olympics must have been like.To me, Hunger Games would be the futuristic Greek olympics. What it would look like if T.V.s were around.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I have been a fan for Megadeth since 1990 whwn I was 12, they have always been a great band, but after Cowntdown to Extiction, I got lost from them with some of the albums of the late 90's to early 2000's. A few years back I picked up Endgame, which is a really great album as well, but once I got \\"Thirteen\\" I was blown away, it is hands down the best Megadeth records since Rust in Piece. This album captures you from track one, all the way through the end. Very well mixed and produced. After buying it I got back on the Megadeth kick and bought alot of the previous albums to see what I missed! A+ Record!!!!
B006IDG2T6|4.0|This is overall a very good book! Not very original for those who follow the scientific discoveries on the subject, but still a readable overview + an uncharacteristically encouraging message. Namely - so what if \\"we\\" are biological puppets?! The very fact that we are aware of this allows us to be more compassionate towards our humanity, maybe to build a more decent humanity!<br /><br /> ... as if we had a CHOICE even in being compassionate...<br /><br />Unlike the author, I sure hope that this is not The Definite Answer to the free will debate. But irrespective of whether it is or is not, there are 5 quotes I feel are worth sharing (or have felt worth sharing by the various causes beyond my control ... was it even me who felt ... ah, whatever, let this puppet who induces an illusion of me-ness press the keyboard buttons! ;)<br /><br />1)  \\"One fact now seems indisputable: Some moments before you are aware of what you will do next - a time in which you subjectively eappear to have complete freedom to behave however you please - your brain has already determined what you will do. You then become coscious of this \\"decision\\" and believe that you are in the process of making it.\\"<br /><br />2) \\"To say that they were free NOT to rape and murder is to say that they could have resisted the impulse to do so (or could have avoided feeling such an impulse altogether) - with the iniverse, including their brains, in precisely the same state it was in at the moment they committed their crimes. Assuming that violent criminals have such freedom, we reflexively bleame them for their actions.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"If you pay attention to your inner life, you will see that the emergence of choices, efforts, and intentions is fundamentally mysterious process. Yes, you can decide to go on a diet - and we know a lot about the variables that will enable you to stick to it - but you cannot know why you were finally able to adhere to this discipline when all your previous attempts failed. You might have a story to tell about why things were different this time around, but it would be nothing more than a post hoc description of events that you did not control.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Anyone born with the soul of a psychopath has been profoundly unlucky\\"<br /><br />5) \\"Despite our attachement to the notion of free will, most of us know that disorders of the brain can trump the best intentions of the mind. This shift in understanding represents progress toward a deeper, more consistent, and more compassionate view of our common humanity.\\"ght have a story to tell about why things were different this time around, but it would be nothing more than a post hoc description of events that you did not control.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Anyone born with the soul of a psychopath has been profoundly unlucky\\"<br /><br />5) \\"Despite our attachement to the notion of free will, most of us know that disorders of the brain can trump the best intentions of the mind.

B005LAIH54|5.0|I WENT TO SEE THE 3D MOVIE OF THE HIGHLY PUBLISIZED \\"JOHN CARTER\\" WAS DECENT BUT \\"WRATH OF THE TITANS\\" WAS PROBABLY THE BEST \\"EYE CANDY\\" MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. SOME OF THE BEST USE OF 3D THAN EVEN \\"AVATAR\\". I THINK AVATAR WAS A BETTER MOVIE AND THE 3D WAS THE BEST BUT TITANS USED 3D TO MAKE THE EFFECTS MUCH MORE SPECTACULAR. THE STORYLINE MOVED VERY QUICKLY SO THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SLOW DOWN TIME. ABSOLUTLY SOME OF THE BEST SPECIAL Effects I HAVE EVER SEEN. I OWN A 3D TV AND HAVE A LARGE COLLECTION OF 3D MOVIES. I HAVE NOT COUNTED ALL THE MOVIES I HAVE, INCLUDING 2D MOVIES, BUT IT IS IN THE HUNDREDS AND HAVE BEEN A MOVIE GURU FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. I AM NOT A PAID Critic BUT I THINK I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON JUDGING A MOVIE.<br />THERE ARE BETTER ACTED MOVIES OUT THERE BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BE DAZZELED AND ENTERTAINED THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR THAT. THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF COMBAT VIOLENCE BUT THE VISUAL EXPERIENCE IS EXHILARATING. GO TO THE RESTROOM BEFORE THE MOVIE SO YOU WON'T MISS A THING.<br />  THANK YOU  PETE STROEM

0345803485|1.0|If you have any inclination as to live in your protagonist's skin. . . you have a sore bottom coming to you. This book is a poorly written work of psuedo-erotica. A piece of advise I'd like to give the main \\"character\\" Save yourself for something better.  I'll give you the possible reader a similar message, save your eyesight for something better. After reading the whole horrid (I can't in honesty call it a novel)mess your still not sure what the character looks like or how she is growing, changing,evolving. But wait that's not the worst part!(Insert Ample Sarcasm Here)<br /><br />Seriously, this book propagates the Virgin Mary Myth. Anna the protagonist is a virgin, she is the savior that redeems \\"christian\\" and makes him a reformed man. (hmm. . .wait a christian so to speak) Be forewarned, the concept of  \\"Turn the other cheek\\" , in this book does not refer to your face, but rather your bumm. People with DSM diagnosis are not often \\"helped\\" by the Virgin alone. These helping people are called C0-DEPENDENTS. And rather than put up with abuse and debasement should run in the other direction. Not chase after the next erection.<br /><br />If you would like to high-light the naughty scenes and pass it around to your friends in high-school for a group reading frenzy, or pass it around while serving time, well that's one thing. But, please especially the younger women out there, this girl is not to be emulated. This is not literature.<br /><br />By the way another thing I hate about christian Grey, Who the F*&# is he to tell Anna always to start with Wikipedia when doing research.  This is another horrible life style habit discussed in this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not usually the type of book I read, but I downloaded te book today AND finished it in one sweep. Really could not put it down and I will finish the 2 following books tomorrow. Loved it.
0345803485|1.0|This is an amazing book in that it is so utterly tedious.  I am only half way through and started skimming a quarter into it.  I do want to know if anything ever happens.<br /><br />The repetitive, cute language is lazy and annoying.  The biting the lip, cupping the chin, looking up through the (eye) lashes, goes on forever.<br /><br />I can't imagine that I will be able to finish it, and the idea of a trilogy is really weirder than any sex in the book.<br /><br />It should be a crime to make sex so boring.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This continuation of \\"The Hunger Games\\" is really fast pased and full of action. I like this book even more than the first. In this book things take a twist for Katniss and Peeta. Pres Snow is not very happy with them, or I should say Katniss. He does try to get his revenge but things obviously don't turn out they way he wants. The book ends with things in the air and I'm sure readers before me felt the same way. You have to pick up the 3rd book imediately. Very easy and fast read. Again I can't believe I resisted reading this trilogy for so long!! Definitely a must read!!!
B000JM599G|5.0|I found this (audiobook) illuminating.  I learned more effective approaches to make change, yet without so much unrewarding effort that I became frustrated.  The author carefully shares his extensive understanding of why change does not have to be difficult.  A gratifying experience.

I felt the ending was perfect, I know some would disagree with me, but the ends justified the means. And in the end right is might. I can't say anymore or else I'll give a way the book. Those who've already read the first 2 books will enjoy this one. You'll get the answers you want.
0061785652|4.0|I've always enjoyed Rollins' high-tech thrillers, and this is the best one to date for several reasons.<br />As always with Rollins, it's beautiful just to watch the way disparate, seemingly unconnected plot elements are woven together.  The mix is seasoned with all kinds of nuggets from history, science, myth, and high tech, and sometimes you think it's gotten so complicated it will fall apart, but it never does.  This is Rollins the master plotter at his best.  As a science writer/historian, I have a good feel for how much research goes into a book, and Rollins has done enough to make my head hurt just contemplating it.<br />Rollins also does the best job so far with his people. Yes, his heroes are still thriller heroes, easily shrugging off wounds and benefitting from all kinds of lucky coincidences, but Rollins is willing to inflict devastating emotional pain on a lead character and leave us uncertain about how he'll function when the next threat comes.  His guest cast is good - the Native American historian in particular is instantly three-dimensional and sympathetic.  Giving the chief villain a crippling disease to make a murderer sympathetic seems hokey and shouldn't work, but Rollins pulls it off.<br />Not everything Rollins presents as real science or history qualifies as such to me: two of the books on his recommended reading list are by cranks.  But Rollins the storyteller uses tropes like \\"the secret society behind all the other secret societies\\" with such skill that readers willingly go along.  He did not convince me a pre-industrial society had somehow acquired nanorobotic technology - the idea remains absurd even in Rollins' skilled hands - but I was willing to give him a pass even on this one because he did everything else so well.  I learned some things about Thomas Jefferson, physics, and geology I didn't know, and I had terrific fun learning them.<br />This is simply a superb thriller, rocket-paced, fill of colorful characters and cool technology, and bursting with entertaining ideas. To top it off, the author springs a jaw-dropping surprise on the final page that will leave readers drooling with anticipation for the next book.  Rollins is at the height of his powers.<br /> - Matt Bille, [...], author: The First Space Race: Launching the World's First Satellites (Texas A&M, 2004)th entertaining ideas.

0061537969|4.0|I wasn't sure about this book but I tried it and I'm glad I did. It talks about racing a lot but I didn't mind, as it pertained to the entire story. I really liked this book. I was crying at the end but it's such a nice surprising ending.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|The Kindle sample seemed promising, but soon into the book I realized that it was no more than soft core porn, which I had not bargained for.<br />What's more, it's not even arousing.<br />Just plain ridiculous.<br />The protagonist, a 21 year old virgin, delves into a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with a ridiculously good looking sqillionaire ( ! ) and discovers she has an insatiable appetite for sex. As if.<br />It's a lot of baloney, and I can't believe it made the NY Times best seller list.<br />I would rate it zero stars, if I could.<br />Hated it.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|The navigation is really lacking in the Trilogy Edition of this book. You can't navigate between chapters in each book, you can only jump to each part, where each book is split into (I believe) 3 parts. Also for some reason the font is at least twice as large as in the individual books.<br /><br />BUY THE BOOKS INDIVIDUALLY.<br /><br />The $2 you save by buying the 3 books as one is not worth it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|recently upgraded to the epic touch and it works great on both phones. creates word docs and other formats, plus accesses Google docs.
B006Z21ZEM|4.0|Alright, let me first say that I am somewhat of a fanboy, having been a fan for over 25 years now. I always buy the \\"new\\" release whatever it may be, on the day it's released (or in this case pretty soon thereafter). But when I write a review here on Amazon I always try to be honest and objective, hey let's face it even the mighty Maiden are not infallible.<br /><br />Having said that let me also say that The Final Frontier was/is not my favorite studio release to say the least. It's full of very wordy, epic-length, non-rhyming, mid-paced songs that sometimes take their toll on even a fanboy, but it's still a good album, just not Maiden's finest hour. Well, En Vivo is the live album that documents maiden touring for that album, so as any Maiden fan should know, Iron Maiden have put a lot of new material on the set-list--they're proud of it and I can respect that.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the half of FF that's played live sounds pretty damn good. Much more well... ALIVE sounding. This live CD has gotten me \\"re-interested\\" in The Final Frontier and after a few more spins I like it better. they play six new tracks on this set-list, all of them played to perfection, as expected. of course any Maiden fan probably already has all these songs on separate studio releases, but the fun in a live album is hearing your heroes perform live and spontaneously, channeling the live-experience on to you, the listener. Iron Maiden have certainly perfect this, they are a LIVE band that must record studio albums if only to have a reason to tour and play live.<br /><br />The set-list is good, but anyone could nit-pick it, me included. As far as new tracks, I don't care for the single El Dorado and would have preferred to hear something else off the new album, The Alchemist or Mother of Mercy perhaps.<br /><br />Satellite 15/ The Final Frontier are great and certainly belong right where they are. the Talisman sounds even better live, it reminds me of Rhyme of the Ancient mariner. Coming Home is another great track, sound like a Dickinson solo song to me. And finally, When the Wild Wind Blows is another new song that I appreciate more fully now.<br /><br />As far as \\"old\\" songs, I for one could live without the endless live renderings of Trooper, Fear of the Dark, Iron Maiden, Hallowed, Number etc. But, I also understand that this is  a live album, and the people who paid big money for a concert ticket to see Maiden, fully expect to hear thes songs played live, and so would I. I just don't need another CD with The Trooper on it.<br /><br />If there's anything \\"wrong\\" with the set-list it's just that they have a ton of great songs and only a few albums represented here. Nothing from A Matter of Life and Death, Somewhere in Time, Powerslave, Killers, No Prayer (understandable),X-Factor or Virtual XI.<br /><br />On the bright side, everything here sounds awesome, all the songs are good ones and Maiden are still alive and well. It's much more fun to see though, so I recommend the DVD or Blue-ray.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it's really fun to play. there is a lot of strategy needed since there is only a certain amount of energy to use. the only thing I wish was different is that there was unlimited energy and that it had equal prices and not all the pay money to get certain things.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is THE best of the weather apps. The interface takes a few tries to get use to but worth the effort.
B006C452HO|5.0|If he likes cowboys and you like aliens, this is the movie for both of you! Harrison Ford is the best cowboy, Adam Beach is an actual Indian and what girl can't get enough of Daniel Craig, bravo everyone for the best film for date night ever!!!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers, the book goes along in a slow pace. To be honest, the book was okay, except I had a hard time finishing it. It was too slow for me and I was irritated by the father's point of view, maybe because I don't have kids. It took great effort to finish and at the end, with the twist, I had no emotion towards it. Maybe it's just not for me. Oh well.
B006JJBFK0|3.0|I have been waiting for this CD with high expectations, given their announcement of new vocalist Manuella Krammer and a heavier, more metal-like sound. However, I find this CD a bit disappointing. I found that all songs sound pretty much the same, with very little variation in rhythm and style, and it is sometimes hard to distinguish one song from another in this CD. That being said, I see that the band has improved instrumentally, and the orchestral arrangements are now way better than what they used to be. I would rank this CD below India (by far their best release to date) and Ravenheart, but above Salome and Kill the Sun.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Saw this on the news and had to find out why it was so popular - now I know why.  Very well written and interesting.  More than just erotica - great character development.  Once you start reading you will have trouble stopping.

B00004VVND|5.0|I recently saw a Fantasy Island episode on late night tv that played off this movie and decided to get the movie and reacquaint myself to it.<br /><br />It's the perfect part for Yul Brynner and I even got caught up in the movie which I normally don't do. So it hooked me even though I'm not really into sci-fi movies.<br /><br />I'm starting to come around and like Yul Brynner as an actor. I have to stop judging him against more accomplished and well rounded actors who are more versatile.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|All I can say is this album is spectacular. I have been a HUGE fan of Max Cavalera since his early days with Sepultura. Since his forming of Soulfly each album has had its own unique sound that we have come to expect and love from these fine artists. This albums is no exception. Truly from the moment I put it in I was blown away. Tracks 2, 3, 5, 9 and 11 are my favorite..!!! Each one is brutal and more hardcore than the next. Also Soulfly returned to a more thrashy sound which I truly love. If you want a kick ass album from the start to the end definitely get this album! The day I got it I must have listened to the album 6-7 times straight through!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|i agree with negative reviewer comments about the writing simplicity and over use of same words. first book reads like a diary and second one changes scenes abbruptly a few times. like the author was writing the screenplay already.  this did not stop me from buying all the books in the trilogy though. take it for what it is an easy read when you need an escape.
0307887960|5.0|[[ASIN:0307887960 The Dukan Diet: 2 Steps to Lose the Weight, 2 Steps to Keep It Off Forever]]<br />I lost 10 pounds in 5 days, and another 10 pounds in the following 2 weeks.<br />This is a fantastic diet. It is not one of those strange diet regimes like cabbage or South Beach. You need to follow it to the letter. Even though I cheated during the attack phase a bit by eating spicy ramen soup, I still lost. The best thing is that you can eat as much and as often as you like, as long as it is on the list.<br /><br />A co-worker who is vegetarian did it with me and he had a hard time because there is a lot of protein you need to consume, and it is in the form of fish and meat. Vegans should look elsewhere I think. The method actually changes the way you think about food and I now find myself looking at content labels on food. Something I have never done before. I do not have a sweet tooth so avoiding those treats was no big deal for me. The yogurt gave me enough \\"sweet\\" to satisfy any errant desires.<br /><br />If you travel a lot for work as I do, it is even easier because I have to conscientiously select each meal since I am in a hotel. This is much easier than being at home and watching the kids eat mac and cheese....
B004FOA84A|4.0|Was a little short but I enjoyed following the logical clues. Certainly was worth the .99 I spent on it and hope there will be other similar titles.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Once more, the loner, Jack Reacher, finds himself plunked into the middle of a very messy, very bad situation. As is usual Lee Child & Jack Reacher do not disappoint the reader.<br />I found Jack to be more a thinking man in this one, having infiltrated the bad guy's encampment (Manhattan). The action is fast & furious later in the book. The story will take the reader from upper & lower Manhattan to Africa to London. Having to do with special forces, which Reacher understands well, the reader will find things are not always as they seem. A kidnapping may very well turn into something completely different 2/3 of the way through the novel. Not to worry, it all works out and Mr. Child makes sure it works very well.<br /><br />I've read just about all the Reacher series novels and have yet to find a clunker. Some better than others. But, not one I could say I really did not like. These novels fit as comfortably as a well broken in glove.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|Are you old enough to remember the space race and the first time an American set foot on the Moon? The Apollo 11 crew achieved that feat in July, 1969 and were followed by Apollo 12 in November, 1969. Apollo 13 attempted the trip in 1970, but an accident early in the mission prevented the landing. Instead, the mission became one of survival. Would the three astronauts make it back to Earth?<br /><br />Jim Lovell (Hanks), Fred Haise (Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Sinise) were set to make the trip, but Mattingly was replaced by Jack Swigert (Bacon), because it was feared that Mattingly might develop the measles on the trip. Gene Kranz (Harris) was in charge of Mission Control on the ground.<br /><br />I remember the broadcasts of the Apollo 11 trip, but the American public were not particularly interested in seeing live footage by the time the Apollo 13 mission took place. We see the crew filming each other for TV, but they don't know that the pictures aren't being shown live. That all changed the moment the accident occurred. Instead of being a boring event, lives were suddenly at stake. TV crews scrambled to cover the unfolding events.<br /><br />Hanks, Harris, Paxton, Sinise and Bacon are at their best in Apollo 13. We see the importance of trusting in the overall ability of the team, both in space and back in Houston. Director Ron Howard does a good job of showing how events aboard the ship affected things on the ground. The accident gave both teams several problems to overcome and it wouldn't have happened if either team had failed to contribute.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine three men sitting in a confined space holding our attention for over two hours, but that's exactly what happens. You may not know how the original events unfolded, but the tension builds effectively even if you know how the story will end.<br /><br />The overall look of the movie feels authentic. Shots of space are particularly effective. It's almost impossible to listen to the sound of the launch without feeling moved in some way.<br /><br />The movie is structured in such a way that we feel that the three astronauts have something to lose other than their own lives. The first 30 minutes show Lovell interacting with his wife, Marylin (Kathleen Quinlan), and their children. We also see other crew members and it gives us a glimpse of their personalities. This segment is so effective and adds a lot to the remainder of the movie. Howard makes us feel as though we are back in 1970 and that we are part of Lovell's family or immediate friends.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release isn't bad. Picture quality is adequate and the sound, particularly during the launch, is up to the task. I'm glad I upgraded.aunch without feeling moved in some way.<br /><br />The movie is structured in such a way that we feel that the three astronauts have something to lose other than their own lives.

B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun and funny. I like the different challenges and obstacles. I do not like the lack of response during flight.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This game is, first off, absolutely adorable.  I love the graphics and design & the little grocery items are just too cute.  I admit that it does get frustrating at times, but all in all, it's a very well designed, unique, and fun game for all ages.  (My 4 year old takes my kindle fire hostage at times and this is always the game he goes for.)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Exciting. Believable, fun.  The characters came alive as I was reading.  An easy read, referred by my adult grand children.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the story.  I truly did not want to put the story aside and was sorry when I finished the trilogy.  Now going to the movie with my daughter and grand daughters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've been using AccuWeather for Android since I got my kindle fire for Christmas of last year (2011).  It has been accurate within 3 or 4 degrees every time I've checked it, has an amazingly simple interface which shows today's forecast, along with hour to hour and weekly options, and I have never had the first technical problem from the app.  I would highly recommend this for those of you who work, as I do, in the weather & need to know how to dress/prepare for work in the morning.  It's handy, convenient, and surprisingly accurate.

0062124293|4.0|Caitlin Moran is like Oprah....she's Every Woman!  Seriously, I wish Oprah still had a book club going, to give this author and this book the attention it deserves.  She's hilarious, crude, rude and honest.  Whether dropping \\"F\\" bombs (and don't we all...in our heads, anyway?) or calling things by the same names we call them, she hits the nail on the head every time.<br /><br />By shamelessly sharing her female experience, she guides us all on a version of the journey that is a heck of a lot more fun than the any tale most of us could write.  What a great outlook, even when it is occasionally TMI.  A warning, this is not for the faint of heart, or those that take offense too easily.<br /><br />Whether you consider yourself a feminist or not, if you are a woman you will find much to laugh about, agree with, and recall from your past here.  In fact, maybe the guys should read it too.  They might understand us better.  Another reviewer compared the author to Germaine Greer, writing in her 30s with a sense of humor.  I think that's right on, for this may very well be \\"The Female Eunuch\\" of our time.  It's a classic.  She shares serious feminine issues in a real way that will speak to women who agree with her or disagree.  I plan to purchase copies for the females in my family, and some friends, because a book this fantastic deserves to be read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy, and I am not a sit down and read person.  I recommended these books to everybody I know and all I wanted to do was read, forget work and/or socialize with anybody else.  I was way too interested in Christian Grey's next move =]
B004SUWR2C|2.0|I love to play the card game Uno with friends and family.  I also have a great PC version from 1995 that I can play single player with.  I was hoping that this version would he at least as good as the one written almost 20 years ago,  so  I decided to risk a dollar on this game.  I wish I had my money back.  The game is visually uninteresting. The card control is clumsy and requires you to touch the screen multiple times to select the correct card.  The music is annoyingly repetitive.  I really don't understand why an additional 80 Mb download was required, because I didn't see anything to justify the extra bloat.  If this was the labor of love from a fan,  I would give it a high rating.  Since it is the official licensed version,  I have much higher expectations.  The official version user interface shouldn't look and feel this bad.

B003FSTN52|5.0|Since Blade Runner I have been a huge fan of Ridley Scott.  He has given me so much joy though a screen I don't have the words.  So here is a TV show produced by the man. I'm not shocked I love this show but like always I am delighted.  I'm not going to spoil anything but the characters are complex and feel real.  the stories are complex and beautifully told.  I don't know what to say but I like this more than Law and Order and I love Law and Order.

B004ZN9ERI|5.0|The PINK FLOYD debut is very different from later classics like Dark side of the moon and the Wall... PIPER got a much more rock oriented sound...the Floyd sound really begins to be the CLASSIC FLOYD style when David Gilmour comes to the band later...On Piper at the gates of Dawn, Pink Floyd shows some clearly influences from the Beatles...I really enjoy this debut by this fantastic band, but don´t go expecting Wish you were here or the Wall...
B0061S073A|5.0|I bought my 4 year old a kindle for her birthday (horrible parent right?) because she kept taking the iphone and using it. I love how she cant leave this app unless she puts in the pin. she always hits home and it will automaticly direct her back into kids place. she has all of her learning games and books in one place. this also makes it easier if someone wanted to use it as well it can turn back into the full fledged kindle with no restrictions. my daughter will also press buttons in her game &quot;buy full version&quot; &quot;upgrade now&quot; or &quot;buy other apps&quot; and this program does not allow her to do this. I don't have to hover over her to see what she is doing every time.
B004ZN9OTG|5.0|The famous PINK FLOYD album with the cow in the front is AMAZING! The title track ATOM HEART MOTHER is a total music gem, it´s like classical music! The other songs shows beautiful acoustic guitars and very cool instrumentals! This is definitelly another classic by FLOYD! GREAT GREAT MUSIC!
0345803485|5.0|This was a quick read that I enjoyed as a working mom of two. Sure there were parts that didn't seem believable but it is a fictional novel. I loved the brief break it gave me from dishes, email and political commercials. Here is a more in depth view of my review. [...]
B000024D4R|5.0|I love all the stuff FLOYD did...Most of the songs are great, unique and classic...ANIMALS is another perfect moment! There´s 3 storys, and the 3 are amazing! This is a very dark album, but got some of the best guitars from Gilmour...Say what you want about ROGER WATERS, but the man is a genious...Seriously...His way to make music it´s soberb...One of the greatest artists of all time, for sure...
B005K17RU0|5.0|I don't usually rate apps 5* but this app has everything, i.e. asthma, arthritis, and many other information is available.  It even has a built in radar simulation.  The future forecast is done by the hour with just a swipe of the finger.
B004ZN9J0K|5.0|The second album from PINK FLOYD is another musical masterpiece! The title track, LET THERE BE MORE LIGHT and SET THE CONTROLS TO THE HEART OF THE SUN are among the best songs from FLOYD! This is brilliant...if you like music try to listen to this magic and psichodelic rock trip!
B0073XORCY|1.0|I really wanted to like this release but cannot find it in myself to do so. The idea is misguided, the absence of Martin Barre devastating, and the album disappointing. This work is not even up to the level of Dot.Com which was a very weak Tull album. It seems that Ian no longer writes songs but instead poetry that he half sings/half talks his way through. Most of the music is meandering and there is really nothing memorable to be found on this recording. I realize that TAAB2 is an Anderson solo album and it appears that Jethro Tull is finished. Martin Barre's contribution might have made this work listenable to me but I doubt if even he could save this sub-par tribute to Anderson's ego.<br />It's a shame Anderson hasn't spent more effort on making Jethro Tull a going concern over the past few years. At least there are some great memories and the old albums to hear again.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|At least non-relevant to those who have read the novels.  The basic problem is that the novels were so incredibly detailed, that making a TV series out of them doesn't add anything to the story.  In fact, when they make changes in the story or characters, it takes away from the story.  Now, for those who have not read the books, it is probably a good watch, although some mis-perceptions of events may occur compared to the reality.<br /><br />What may have made more sense, and maybe 20 years down the road, the series will be re-made again, would be to either completely stick to the books (they do say that the future of TV and movies made using books as sources will be to stick as close to the source material as possible), or perhaps they should have down a few movies, or the best idea - to set some movies or a series set entirely dealing with the events at and beyond the Wall.  After all, this is where the most interesting cinematography occurs anyhow.<br /><br />While there have been some changes in characters, for the most part the actors are well-acted and  interesting, in particular (don`t mind my spelling): Eddard, Jon Snow (looks like Deidrich Bader), The Old Bear Mormont, King Baratheon, Ser Jorah, Arya, Sansa, Jamie, The Hound, Shagga.  Of course the key to good directing is to choose actors who fit the roles, not to change the roles to fit the actors.<br /><br />Khal Drogo is unfortunately a complete non-character as portrayed.  Theon will probably turn out well with his actor.<br /><br />That being said, they did make some changes from the books that were really not necessary (and therefore kinda of makes you wonder why they made them), for instance:<br /><br />- Catylyn Stark (and her sister Lysa Aryn) are way, way too old.<br />- Cersei is supposed to be a great beauty, but they choose a very plain actress to play her.<br />- the Dothraki are supposed to be Mongols.<br />- Robert never baited the Lannisters (not counting Cersei).<br />- Ser Loras was supposed to be someone that folks looked up to, instead they've turned him into a prancing fool<br />- Robert never intended to join the joust, it was the melee.<br />- for important reasons, they needed to make it very clear that Jamie was a great swordsman, but it is rarely shown or referenced<br />- the Others would never cut off someone's head or dis-assemble them, cos' then they wouldn't come back very well as wights.<br />- the books never specifically portrayed Ser Loras and Renly as homosexuals.  That is to say, they may have been and they may have not been, but there was no evidence either way.  Certainly, there were some insults thrown around from others characters, but then again accusing your enemies of homosexuality has been the insult of choice since the first battles at the dawn of time all the way up to the present war against Iraq.<br />- Jamie would never stab someone in the eye, Jamie was the best swordsman in the land and certainly doesn't need tricks to beat some hack household guard..<br />- Littlefinger was never a hands-on brothel manager, it was just a file in his business portfolio.<br />- Catylyn's \\"investigation\\" of Bran's accident was a bit ridiculous.<br />- the sky cells should be far narrower, there is supposed to be a constant fear of falling out when sleeping (not rolling 20 ft to get to the edge).<br />- the Lannisters are supposed to have blond hair, not dirty brown.<br />- Joffrey & Gendry should have long hair (and actually Joffrey is supposed to have long, curly hair), although long curly hair would have been difficult to pull off on TV to be honest.<br />- Winterfell seems way too big and built up.<br />- Robert and Gendry should have jet black hair (a key plot point).<br />- Gendry seems too old.<br />-  Lysa is supposed to be fat.<br />-  Sam Tarly is not fat enough.<br />- the king should be a lot taller (after all he was supposed to be one of the strongest warriors in the land), ever hear of `lifts`, boots, trick photography?,sheesh.<br />- Cersei's emotion about a black-haired baby didn't to seem to make any sense considering the circumstances (I really think that would confuse viewers).<br />-  too much of a difference in height / age between Arya and Sansa.<br />-  Arya would never have made that bow shot.<br />- Jon should be at the king's feast.<br />Renly is supposed to be very charismatic and can gather many to his banners, yet the character on the tv series has no charisma at all<br />- the older Night's Watch man was the one who survived, not the younger one.<br />- i could be wrong, but i seem to recall that Lord Walder could not walk.<br />- Rickon is too old.<br />- and obviously the Moon Door is not in the floor, it is on a wall standing vertical (and face it, do you really think anyone is stupid to build an entire stone throne room over an empty space?)<br />- I have also just heard that Season Two starts with a horrific event that did not happen in the books.<br /><br />None of these issue are major issues by themselves, but a lot of mistakes tend to add up, especially since they could have been corrected.<br /><br />And of course, as with most HBO shows, there is a certain amount of low-level prostitution (ie: a lot of the actresses will paid to take their clothes off and appear in sexual scenes).  There are additionally regular characters that are actually playing prostitutes or courtesans as well.  Hey, I am definitely not complaining about nudity, although HBO does come off as exploitative sometimes.<br /><br />The best part I think in the first season was the Wall, a very interesting place<br /><br />The overall impression that I received, was that I've already read the books, watching the 1st season really didn't add to the Games of Thrones experience, so I don't feel any particular desire to watch the second season.  That being said, for folks who haven't read the books, go for the 2nd season, I'm sure it's a lot better than Xena the Warrior princess (although oneof those does show up later for that matter in the series).
044042321X|3.0|George R.R. Martin's \\"Game of Thrones\\", has become a multi-media sensation.  Graphic Novel, TV series, novel...Who knows if this will also join the growing ranks of video games AND audio novel versions.<br /><br />This, surprisingly, is my first exposure to A Game of Thrones, but I have been keenly aware of the buzz Martin's work has created.  Volume 1 covers books 1-6 of the comic book series by Daniel Abraham and Tommy Patterson.  With Winter coming upon King's Landing, Eddard Stark, his wife Catelyn, sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon, daughters Arya and Sansa, and the bastard Jon Snow live peacefully until the threat of war comes.  The right Hand of the King has passed away, and Robert rides to help.  Across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys starts his claim to the throne.  Through this all, the families of Stark nearly pay the price for intrigue born of a desperate plea for power.  Bran pays the price for his knowledge as his discovery of a palace romance plays on the edge of Traitorship.  His life, hangs by a thread and begins to play on the faith in Stark Men, and women amongst themselves and their allies.  As the men move to war, both the frontier, and defence of the King, the price of faithfulness to the King is beginning to be realized.<br /><br />The price of a throne is indeed high, and marriages of convenience need not involve love, but obedience and the future.  The adaptation is well done, and action packed.  Clearly, this is a book that will find another audience than the show, and build on other media.<br /><br />I like the art, but find that his portrayal of the Queen, Catelyn as an older woman (I presume) is faulty.  Perhaps she is a young queen, and not the mother of the children.  It is not explained.  Patterson certainly can illustrate attractive women.<br /><br />Is this a faithful adaptation?  I cannot say.  Is it enjoyable?  Yes.  Do I want to read more?  Yes.<br /><br />The Game of Thrones is clearly that.<br /><br />Read on.<br /><br />Tim Lasiutaa
B0055SWM08|5.0|I think its awesome because there is so many levels and like when I go to sleep I can't wait to play it again
B0024F08RO|3.0|I have to be honest and say this didn't meet the standards of the first 3 seasons. I went from loving the show to not really caring during this season. My suggestion is to get the other 3 seasons and skip this one.
1609419693|4.0|The audiobook is narrated by Tina Fey, which is awesome. I snickered, and had several laugh out loud moments. This was such a fun memoir to listen to, and I have to admit that I don't even watch SNL (just a sketch once in a while on YouTube) or 30 Rock (sorry Tina). She tells about growing up, how she got started, working SNL, being the boss (bossypants) of 30 Rock, and motherhood. I would recommend this to anyone (err... adults), but highly recommend for women and fans!
B003BW0CB6|1.0|First:  any of these 5 star reviews must have been written by someone with a diminished intellect and someone that has never actually witnessed a real trial.  Second:  This entire book is nothing more than a really, really long newspaper article.  Third:  most of the five star morons also seem to think that a book review is a 7 paragraph summary of the plot and an identification of all the characters, their motivations and how the story ends.  That is not a review; that is a story summation - get is strait folks.<br /><br />Here is a review:  The book is a long, drawn out, description of a criminal trial.  Trials like this happen every day in every courthouse in every state.  There a a few (FEW) details that make this trial more interesting than a misdemeanor B&E, but not many.  The author tries to create some kind of tension or twist by making the lead attorney, who is normally a defense attorney, a prosecutor.  Guess what - a good attorney can switch sides in a heartbeat.  A good attorney can argue both sides without even thinking.  No tension here.<br /><br />The end.  No twist.  No Turns.  No revelations.  Nada.  The book is a waste of time.  Shame on the author and publisher.

B005EHNMWM|4.0|I don't know if it is a sign of my age but I have strong belief in the \\"album\\" as an artistic statement for a musicians. Hits or catchy songs are great but I want to be able to listen to an entire album and be able to discover new connections and threads within the music, lyrics, or themes. The past couple Wilco albums have't really resonated with me because it seemed that their vision was muddied. I think Wilco has found a comfortable place, worked through many difficulties and have released a subtly fantastic record. There are the trademark Tweedy turn of phrases, catchy melodies, interesting soundscapes, and a nice amount of tasteful jamming. I think I will be listening to this album for a while and will revisit it over the years. If you have taken a break from Wilco, this is a good place to get reacquainted. I definitely recommend the extended version. The extra tracks are worth it!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I was going to get this game until I read of the problem in which only 2 worlds were given. I would like to say that my positive attitude toward amazon is slipping with all the high prices and slow updates Where's My Water also have people begging for updates. PvZ is the same way I hope amazon fixes these problems for apps. Book service is good though.
B003YOEXUM|5.0|I have owned this CD for just over a year and every song is still on my playlist except for the title track.  If I had to pick, my favorites would have to be Teutonic Terror, Rollin' Thunder, and Bucketful of Hate.  I was not a fan of Accept in the 80's, but I can't wait for their next album.  If you miss the sound of classic metal, do yourself a favor and buy this!

B006ZCWTZG|5.0|This is truly a welcome redemption from Bruce after 2009's \\"Working On A Dream\\".  What that album lacked, this album makes up for.  A masterpiece that was intended to be listened to in it's entirety.  The characters have all be etched out of the economic turmoil of recent years.  Pain, frustration, anger and hope are all represented here.  It's the formula that has always worked best for Bruce as he becomes a voice for the millions that have yet to be heard.  The blend of celtic, soul and rock all work terrific together and deliver a spiritual and refreshing album.  I highly recommend the vinyl purchase because not only do you get to appreciate it on the only available media Bruce was first introduced to us on but you also get a CD copy as well!

No. I guess even the most creative sexual people run out of positions at some point. The lead single Give Me All Your Lovin' is just the same old Madonna formula sounding slightly odd for 2012, don'tcha think? And...really...Gang Bang!?? Can you picture Madonna & Guy at a gang bang with Lourdes handing her Molly (hence the brilliant CD title...lol), a chain and oil?<br />  Time to change Madonna...try something new and creative please :)

B004LYS4AY|5.0|Writer/director James Cameron's original Terminator film has Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back in time to 1984. He's programmed to kill Sarah Connor before she can give birth to a son who is destined to lead survivors in a post-apocalyptic war against a self-aware computer network and its army of killing machines.<br /><br />In an example of the future affecting the past, John Connor, Sarah's adult son, dispatches a trusted aide named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect her from the nearly indestructible cyborg. Sarah bonds with Kyle in their mutual struggles. They make love and thus John is conceived.<br /><br />THE TERMINATOR was a huge summer hit, grossing $78 million worldwide in first run vs. a $6 million cost. Its sequel, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was long in coming, but well-worth the seven year wait. In almost every respect, this sci-fi thriller surpasses its predecessor. The concept of TWO terminators in the story equalling twice the film just may be true, thanks in large part to Robert Patrick's grimly determined T-1000 prototype, a superior poly-alloy mechanism capable of morphing into anybody (or thing?).<br /><br />Sarah (Linda Hamilton), who was understandably confused and terrified in the first movie is now confident, buff from working out, and ready for the coming conflagration. Her only obstacle is confinement in a prison-like psych ward. Arnold returns as Cyberdyne model 101, but this time his mission is to protect, not kill Sarah, and especially young John (Edward Furlong). Again, the unseen adult John is trying to make sure he lives in the pre-machine war past, and Arnold is his weapon and shield against a superior cyborg. The battle between the two terminators is epic and to the death, but first, Sarah must be freed.<br /><br />\\"T2\\" is enhanced by brilliant Industrial Light & Magic special effects and the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston. The pace is breathless, the sense of danger unflagging, and the action, mesmerizing.<br /><br />This is one great movie!<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding titles is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.6) Terminator 2: Judgment Day (USA/France-1991) - Arnold Schwarzenegger/Linda Hamilton/Edward Furlong/Robert Patrick

Both items came on time and this item came exceptionally fast. The seller was great. However, I have searched the manual and used several different mics and they are not picking up the sound and it is not working. Neither Behringer products that I bought works as the manual states. I believe it is the cords or just the set up. Anyhow, it is now collecting dust with the other until I figure it out.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Other reviews will say more about the film itself, which is fantastic. But I thought it was especially noteworthy to point out that if you enjoy filmmaking, or are simply interested in what's going on behind the scenes, the features are awesome. There are a large amount of different special features and it would take a long time to get through them all. More importantly, they are all also quite fascinating. Buy it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I am giving this book 5 stars.....I am not sure the writing couldn't have been better but it is just such an amazing story, I could not put it down.  Read it in one day!  And interesting because the author of the \\"Orphan Master's Son\\" consulted with this author.  That book was heart breaking enough....this one is worse because you are reading about a real person.  And the struggles he has trying to assimilate and deal with a growing emotional awareness that had been impossible to have in the camp and survive just makes me want to cry for him.  This book will be with me for a long time.

1612130283|5.0|Very few books have ever kept me up reading until 1:00 in the morning.  I could not get enough of Fifty Shades of Grey.  This book will keep you wanting more (in so many ways).  Feeling as though I was there with Christian and Ana made the book even more enticing.  I highly recommend that you have all three books before you begin reading Fifty Shades of Grey.  The hardest part has been waiting for the arrival of Fifty Shades Darker.  E. L. James is an excellent writer.  The flow of her use of words is extremely enjoyable.  Thank you E. L. James for such an amazing experience!
B005AEQX0C|5.0|Billed as a throwback to the boyband era of the 90s, The Wanted are an energetic outfit of four British and one Irish musician that makes great music.  The opener, \\"Glad You Came,\\" is a driving love song with the catchy chorus, \\"The sun goes down, The stars come out & all that counts is here & now, My universe will never be the same.\\"  The second track mines similar territory, a pumping energetic love song, \\"When your lips touch mine, it's the kiss of life; I know that it's a little bit frightening; We might as well be playing with lightning.\\"  \\"I Want It All\\" slows the pace with strong soaring vocals, \\"I'd do anything to see you through & if I fall my heart holds on to you.\\"  \\"Lie to Me\\" acknowledges the rewards of duplicity with a great feel-slow-but-sounds-fast beat and aching vocals, \\"Smiling like there's nothing wrong; You're good at smiling; so keep it plastered on until the morning.\\"  The set concludes with a sparkling track, \\"Gold Forever.\\"  \\"Battleground\\" succeeds because of the strength of the material and the strong vocals.  Enjoy!
0143119680|2.0|This novel has a great premise, but that's about it.  The characters, including the heroine, are unappealing, and the plot gets bogged down in tedious descriptions of daily activities (like putting on clothes in the morning, and eating meals).  Despite the fact that the main character is smart, and independent, she's nothing without her man.  The whole thing ends up being a poorly disguised traditional romance novel.  Ick.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|At first I thought I would never get through this book. I don't know what it is but the first few (around 100) pages are a slow read. Don't give up because this book is so good. I couldn't put it down. I am glad I pushed through and read it. I hope they make a movie.

B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm Not A Hardcore Star Wars Fan But I Do LIKE The Original Trilogy<br />I Saw The Original Theatrical Versions And I Loved Them, Then I bought The 4 Disc DVD Set And I Thought That The Special Editions are OK<br />But Now That The Blu-Ray is out and everyone is talking about how awesome the movies look and sound i thought i should buy them<br />but the problem is that i only want the original trilogy but i also want the special features<br />and i dont want to pay $89.99 To Own Six Films Which Includes 2 Films I Will Never Watch Again (Phantom Menace & Attack Of The Clones)<br />What do you guys think i should do ?<br />Should I Just Ignore The Blu-Ray And watch the DVDs or Should i Buy Only The Original Trilogy Blu-ray Set ?

B007P3TMW2|4.0|First of all, if you plan to watch this because you are a big fan of Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock - STOP! They are barely in it and Bullock is almost unrecognizable (I kept thinking she was Marcia Gay Harden!) so it's NOT the reason to see this film.<br /><br />This is a story about a smart boy, Oskar, who maybe has Asperger's. He and his dad were very close and the dad would create things to investigate - it was their thing.<br /><br />A year after his dad died in the 9-11 twin tower attack, Oskar finds a key hidden in a vase in his dads closet, which he THINKS is a CLUE for him from his dad and it becomes extremely important and urgent for him to solve (as a way of being close to his dad and making his dad proud, and just plain dealing with the loss of his dad and all the emotions of the secrets he kept from that day).<br /><br />Oskar is often annoying, high strung and rude, but with the Asperger's and what he's been through emotionally it is understandable - and Thomas Horn does a great job with this role.<br /><br />I can understand how many people might not GET this movie or like it, but I thought it was a wonderful story intellectually and emotionally with a satisfying finish.

0802473156|2.0|My wife and I received this book as a wedding gift from a friend, who said this changed her life with her husband.  I take that with a grain of salt though, as their situation was different than ours in almost every way.<br /><br />I'll keep this relatively short.  We read the book together and took the test at the end, and I can flat-out tell you this book is pointless.  Once you know what the 5 Languages are, there's absolutely no reason to get the book or read he pointless stories and drivel that litter it's pages.  Chapman recounts what seem to be very loose 'stories' about how people were on the brink of divorce, but he saved their marriage by telling them what their love language was.  Yay!  Then he goes on to remind you that he tours the country, or that he has other books for sale.  Then, in the next chapter, he basically repeats what he told you in the previous chapter, but offers up a new story.  What he fails to tell you is he's barely qualified to offer any information about the subject.  He's a pastor, has a masters in anthropology, and a doctorate...in adult education...from a seminary.  His wall of diplomas would impress no one, let alone anyone in the psychiatric or counseling field.  He might as well write a book on how to raise children...oh, wait, HE DID!<br /><br />His 5 Languages are so trite and trivial that any person with half a brain could figure them out.  He comes off as pretentious, being a savior of sorts to so many marriages.  His 5 languages are loose generalizations that all married couples should be healthily touching upon on a regular basis.  Not to mention that he constantly insists that as long as the main language is taken care of, all will be well (so if your SO is a physical touch person, you can just hold hands or hug, and never buy her anything and your marriage will be great).  He does say the other languages shouldn't be ignored, but the focus should be placed on the top language.  This is ridiculous advice, as the marriagewill be hollow and unfulfilled if all your energy is exerted on, basically, one task.  He dismisses the fact that some people may have 2 or 3 love languages in about the same score-range, saying to still focus on the top one.  This takes everything out of a marriage.  You're filling the love tank of one with the fuel in the love tank from the other, as you'll get more systematic in your 'language' attention and less about your actual spouse.  Won't be about them so much as the process to make them happy.<br /><br />To further that, he constantly reminds us that dedication and conviction is necessary for the methods to work.  He also doesn't take into consideration speed bumps that may come up on the journey.  So, in short, he gives this advice and assumes that you're in the ideal situation to focus on your SO's love language.  He tells the 'patients' in his stories to go home for a month and focus on one task for the month.  The patient usually comes back and is delighted with success!  If not, he deciphers that it was the wrong love language, and is successful on the 2nd go-around.<br /><br />The issue with his method is that NO ONE can keep up that kind of dedication.  He simplifies the languages to the lowest point (physical touch = holding hands, acts of service = doing the dishes), ignoring the bigger picture of what it would really take to appease a language.  Plus, if people were dedicated and in love, shouldn't they be open enough to KNOW what their SO's language is?  Or at least have an idea?  On the quiz, my wife's language was Quality Time, but I still get nagged if the other languages aren't paid attention to, even if our QT is quite high and fulfilling to us both.  If Chapman's method really worked, I'd think my wife wouldn't care about the other 'languages' since I'm focusing on her top language.  But, that is not the case here, and I highly doubt its the case in most marriages.<br /><br />My wife still keeps this book, and references it like its thegospel when we hit rough patches, but I just can't take any of it more than it being ink on a page.  Truth-be-told, most 'self help' from unlicensed individuals is typically nothing more than snake oil on paper.  Chapman did nothing to change my opinion of that.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have the desktop app installed on my home computers and the mobile app installed on my phone and kindle. I love that my ideas, shopping lists, to do lists, recipes, and more are always at my fingertips. Evernote makes sharing information I've collected with friends, business colleagues, and family so easy, not to mention how much easier shopping is when I make an unplanned trip to the grocery or health food store.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Very good book.  Helpful information on how to break bad habits.  Easy read and worth the time.  I would recommend this book for personal and business applications.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Excellent movie.  Was hesitant purchasing it, but after watching it, This movie is what I call a thinker.  Have to really pay attention or you miss things.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is a must read.  Should be required reading in school.  Amazing how this information is not readily available.  But when you factor the importance of the meat and dairy industry to the economy of the United States, it becomes more obvious.  Take the time to read this book and draw your own conclusions.
B0013DC9XE|5.0|yes i am a fan but it was worth every penny that i have spent on \\"the The Music Of Star Wars: 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition\\"
0345803485|1.0|I'm about 1/3 of the way through, and I cannot believe this was even published. (some spoilers here) Ana is flat, dull, unnaturally immature and dim-witted. She is WORSE than Bella, and you'll want to reach into the pages and slap or strangle her frequently. Christian, is NOT that much of an \\"Alpha Male\\". We get it, he's pretty, rich, and has issues. But he's falling for this twit who has no sexual experience, life experience, or social skills, and he's breaking his own \\"rules\\" with her from day 1. My complaints with the book have nothing to do with the BDSM nature either, that is fine, and actually could be a great turn on / enlightenment of that lifestyle for many people. This book just doesn't do anything right. I think the author read one wikipedia article on BDSM and thinks she knows enough to write a trilogy about it.<br />Also, as many readers have already warned, be prepared to read these phrases OVER AND OVER AND OVER until you want to barf;<br />~oh my, inner goddess, pants hang off his hips IN THAT WAY, DOWN THERE, he gasped she gasped, she blushed,looked at her fingers, biting her lip, stop biting your lip, i want to bite your lip, holy crap. holy insert something else<br />~ok, miss BDSM author, please PLEASE for the LOVE OF GOD use the word VAGINA! I get she's a virgin, but come on! Oh, BUT she's magically a PRO at her first BJ? pick one.<br />~ I'm sure when I read further, I'll find out that he was beaten and or abused as a child, which will be a startling revelation and deep psyco-analytical look into why he's a control freak. shocking. and i'm sure he'll bend to Ana's will, and let her break his rules, and find out that his heart is not really two sizes too small. Even imaging where this story is going is making me roll my eyes. which is also done in the book a bajillion times.
B000ULQV0W|1.0|Just another poor me, crudest from Eddie Vedder.  Only for the lost pj worshippers who will buy anything with Vedder credited on it, this would have tanked.  Yawn!
0385534639|5.0|truly, one of THE BEST books I've ever read.  True, there are tells that it is a \\"novice\\" author. The back and forth timeline gets a wee confusing once in a while, and there are ALOT of characters who whisk in and out, BUT<br />I only regret that it wasn't longer, or that I hadn't read it so fast (23hours) It was magical like Potter, slightly twisty in a Tim Burton way (he should direct the film IMO),  and surreal. I laughed, cried, held my breath, everything the characters went through.  You love/hate many of them, and the author does a beautiful job of brining EVERYTHING full circle.  the timeline, plot, character backgrounds and connections.  SO CLEVER!!  It's one of those books that just sticks with you.  Everything you see, hear, come across for days, you'll be thinking of this story. puffy clouds, popcorn, black and white designs, splashes of red...  it will make you smile.  I could NOT put it down, smuggled the kindle to work, and stayed up til the wee hours reading this AMAZING book.  5 stars, without question.
1400069181|4.0|While visiting Argentina, the author notices simple shoes many natives wear. He decides to adapt the style to American markets and starts his own business. As part of his business model he vows that for every pair he sells he'll give a pair of free shoes to a child in a third world country.<br /><br />How he and a few helpers begin producing his TOMS shoes in a small apartment in California is a story of persistence, follies and successes told with humor and a good-natured tone. The author challenges others to follow his lead and start a business not only for profit but to change the world.<br /><br />An admirable, quick-to-read account of an admirable young man, one worth learning from and copying.
1400069289|4.0|I am reading business books mostly in the area of human relationships and this book was easiest to read and easiest to understand.<br />the reason lies with opening one aspect of our life completely and thoroughly, with lots of examples and fun stories.<br />I recommend this book if you are interested to get a good understanding of Habits and how they shape and act in our lives.<br />I didn't give 5 stars because there are other methods to change the habits for ourselves which he didn't mention in the book.<br /><br />like dissociation with cues and break the pattern all together or methods of changing the reward and not going into pattern. but in any case it is a great book.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading it.
B000ICXQII|5.0|This movie opens up a world that was startling 30 years ago, and is astounding now. I never understood why it ended at one movie. The most original concept to actually see production in the last 50 years. Magnificent.

B005MJFA2W|5.0|Glad I got this book. It highlights strengths and limitations of \\"intuition\\", and ways that our brains can fool us. Impressively supported by research, but written in an accessible style, Kahneman's aim is to better inform \\"watercooler conversation\\" so that we don't fall too readily into the many fallacies to which we are prone. Good reading, with many surprising, sometimes startling, revelations about the workings of the human brain.
0307719219|1.0|To explain why some nations are wealthy and others are poor, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson present a single hypothesis, as opposed to viewing this as a complex problem with many factors. This flies against the research Philip Tetlock presented in his book \\"Expert Political Judgment\\" (2005), in which he showed that pundits who espouse a \\"hedgehog\\" or single point of view predict the future with less than 50% accuracy, when \\"foxes\\" who consider many factors predict the future with greater than 50% accuracy. (For example, Acemoglu and Robinson predict that China's economy will soon crash like the Soviet economy collapsed.)<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson argue that \\"inclusive institutions\\" create a virtuous circle that make nations flourish, and \\"extractive institutions\\" create a vicious circle that makes countries decline. \\"Inclusive institutions\\" share wealth and political power among many citizens. \\"Extractive institutions\\" are used by small elite groups to enslave large groups of people to provide wealth to the elite, and then the wealth is used to strengthen the elite and maintain their power. The authors believe that \\"extractive institutions\\" decline because the elites oppose \\"creative destruction\\" such as new technology because they fear that change will empower the underclass.<br /><br />There is a grain of truth in this hypothesis. The fundamental paradox of ethics is that groups in which members act altruistically prosper when groups in which members act selfishly decline, yet within groups individuals who act selfishly are more successful than individuals who act altruistically.<br /><br />A leader persuades members of a group to stop acting selfishly and instead work together for the common good. The leader must selfishly seek power to force everyone else to change their ways. In a country such as the United States, where institutions generally work, our recent presidents have been amiable. But in a country with great poverty, inequality, and injustice, a leader has to ruthlessly seek power and then use drastic measures to force people to change. Too often the leader then abuses power and the \\"vicious circle\\" Acemoglu and Robinson describe continues.<br /><br />But sometimes multiple factors converge (or, more typically, a common enemy emerges) to get people to work together. If a leader can guide this change without selfishly seeking power, these \\"inclusive\\" institutions become permanent, and the \\"virtuous circle\\" Acemoglu and Robinson describe grows.<br /><br />Perhaps I should give this book three stars for getting part of the story right. But I'm subtracting a star for the many factual errors, and I'm subtracting another star because the book is too long. It's one of these heavy books people buy to leave on their coffee tables to impress guests, but don't actually read.<br /><br />Other reviews have pointed many mistakes. I'll limit this review to mistakes others haven't pointed out.<br /><br />On page 433 the authors say that Europeans encountered \\"empty lands\\" in North America, in contrast to the wealthy and advanced civilizations of the Aztec and the Inca. Actually, North America had civilizations as wealthy and advanced as the Aztec and Inca, and by some measures more advanced than Europe. For example, Cahokia (near present day St. Louis) and the Northwest Coast (where Captain Cook's offer to trade knives for supplies was rejected because the natives made better knives).<br /><br />The authors' stories about how the Spanish conquered the Aztec and Inca don't mention that they brought smallpox, or that the Inca were fighting a civil war at the time, or that the  small (400-man) Spanish forces allied with rebellious neighboring nations to create 100,000-man armies to overthrow the empires.<br /><br />The authors claim that American representative democracy was copied from the English. Actually, it was copied from the Iroquois, who developed representative government in the 14th century (which was much admired by Benjamin Franklin).<br /><br />The authors use England as exemplary, especially the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 that fostered \\"inclusive\\" political power and the Industrial Revolution that created \\"inclusive\\" economic institutions. IMHO, Dickens' London or Ireland in the 1840s looked much like Peru in the 16th century (which the authors present as the paradigm of \\"extractive\\").<br /><br />Ancient Greece and Rome were slave-based economies that enabled an elite to advance the arts and sciences. The scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries was led by wealthy aristocrats. Not all slave-owning elites are opposed to new ideas or change.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that \\"inclusive\\" political and economic institutions are unalloyed good ideas should read \\"Boomerang,\\" by Michael Lewis, about what happened in Iceland, Ireland, Greece, and California when non-elites suddenly had access to capital (i.e., borrowing against their homes' inflated prices), and in California direct democracy (ballot measures) put government in the hands of non-elites.<br /><br />And \\"inclusive\\" groups are always excluding other groups. The Mormons have some of the most inclusive institutions, e.g., they are the only non-governmental group in history that has built large dams and irrigations systems. They are extraordinarily successful, bolstering Acemoglu and Robinson's thesis. And Mitt Romney is making \\"creative destruction\\" a campaign issue. But the Mormons also exclude people, e.g., blacks weren't accepted until recently. \\"Inclusive\\" groups are only inclusive for the people in the group, i.e., \\"inclusive\\" groups have an \\"us vs. them\\" mentality. I suspect that even slave-owners had \\"inclusive institutions\\" to help other slave-owners.<br /><br />Where \\"Why Nations Fail\\" really fails is in describing communist economies. Marxism is inclusive, taking power from the elites to benefit the masses of poor people. You'd expect Acemoglu and Robinson to write favorably about communism but they instead praise the worst aspects of communism and denigrate the best achievements.<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson say that the Soviet Union had extraordinary economic growth from 1928 into the 1970s, and then the Soviet economy stagnated. The authors attribute the growth to Stalin's rapid industrialization, and attribute the decline to the impossibility of \\"creative destruction\\" in a communist economy. The authors use the official Soviet statistics, which are now considered to be highly inflated. Historians such as G.I. Khanin now say that the Soviet Union never had high economic growth. Acemoglu and Robinson suggest that Stalin killing millions of people in the 1928-1940 period contributed to economic growth (by moving resources from agriculture to industrialization) when Khanin says that the Soviet economy shrank 20% in 1928-1932 and again shrank in 1936-1940.<br /><br />In any case, the Soviet Union had too much \\"creative destruction,\\" not too little. Stalin destroyed agriculture to create industrial factories. World War II destroyed much of the country, forcing new construction in the post-war period. After 1975, when the Soviet economy had 0% growth most years, perhaps \\"creative destruction\\" had stopped. If so, are Acemoglu and Robinson saying that killing millions of people and destroying cities is good social and economic policy? IMHO, many factors contributed to the decline of the Soviet economy, not least of which is that Stalinism forced individuals into the most extreme selfish behavior, e.g., denouncing one's friends, neighbors, and even family, causing them to be tortured, exiled to Siberia, or executed, so that the denouncer curried favor from the powerful elites and got a little more food or something, and survived until someone denounced him or her.<br /><br />The 22x growth of China between 1980 and 2010 (the fastest-growing economy in the world, in comparison the United States grew 2.2x in the same period) is ignored except for a littlediscussion at the end of the book about Deng Xiaoping's career. Vietnam's economy grew nearly as rapidly as China's, and is only mentioned as a \\"repressive and extractive\\" economy.<br /><br />Cuba's economy grew 6x, the 7th fastest-growing economy in the world and the fastest growing economy outside of Asia (according to the National Geographic, January 2011, and I verified this growth by asking Cubans if they were six times better off than in 1980, plus looking at their houses, etc.). Cuba's \\"inclusive institutions\\" include universal healthcare and education, universal child nutrition, the elimination of class differences, active fights against racism and sexism (Cuba passed civil rights six years ahead of the United States), care for the environment, the lowest crime rate in Latin America, humanitarian assistance to other developing nations, etc. Yet the authors say only that Cuba (along with Vietnam and Hugo Chavez) is \\"repressive and extractive.\\"<br /><br />The Cuban revolution is an example of multiple factors coming together to effect change. In 1958 Batista was disliked by everyone in Cuba - the elites, the poor, the Americans, and the revolutionaries. Batista didn't even want to be president. He'd been happily retired in Tampa when Meyer Lansky installed him in the lucrative but thankless job of puppet president. IMHO, Fidel Castro came into power by being in the right place at the right time, as opposed to being the cunning, ruthless dictator typically portrayed in the American press. Because everyone agreed that the old system was bad (and those who disagreed with the new government had a short trip to Miami), Fidel had relatively little opposition to building the \\"inclusive institutions\\" that enabled fast economic growth and strong political support. Fidel stayed in power by uniting Cubans against a common enemy, the imperialist United States (i.e., the extractive United Fruit Company) . Now that Cubans' fear of the United States has weakened and the economy has suffered due to the international recession, the revolutionary government is losing support.<br /><br />NPR's \\"Planet Money\\" did a series of stories about Haiti. One story followed a businessman's attempt to build a facility to put mangos into cardboard boxes so they wouldn't get bruised on the way to market. After two years his facility wasn't built because various people claimed to own the land, the deeds had been lost, and the villagers acted in their own selfish interests instead of seeing that selling unblemished mangoes would make everyone prosper. In contrast, in Cuba the government would have just built the facility in a few weeks. Acemoglu and Robinson talk about how a \\"strong central government\\" is needed before \\"inclusive institutions\\" can be fostered, but they fail to see that multiple factors are needed to create a strong central government with the \\"inclusive institutions\\" that limit the power of the elite.but they instead praise the worst aspects of communism and denigrate the best achievements.<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson say that the Soviet Union had extraordinary economic growth from 1928 into the 1970s, and then the Soviet economy stagnated. The authors attribute the growth to Stalin's rapid industrialization, and attribute the decline to the impossibility of \\"creative destruction\\" in a communist economy.

Cuba's \\"inclusive institutions\\" include universal healthcare and education, universal child nutrition, the elimination of class differences, active fights against racism and sexism (Cuba passed civil rights six years ahead of the United States), care for the environment, the lowest crime rate in Latin America, humanitarian assistance to other developing nations, etc. Yet the authors say only that Cuba (along with Vietnam and Hugo Chavez) is \\"repressive and extractive.\\"<br /><br />The Cuban revolution is an example of multiple factors coming together to effect change. In 1958 Batista was disliked by everyone in Cuba - the elites, the poor, the Americans, and the revolutionaries. Batista didn't even want to be president. He'd been happily retired in Tampa when Meyer Lansky installed him in the lucrative but thankless job of puppet president. IMHO, Fidel Castro came into power by being in the right place at the right time, as opposed to being the cunning, ruthless dictator typically portrayed in the American press. Because everyone agreed that the old system was bad (and those who disagreed with the new government had a short trip to Miami), Fidel had relatively little opposition to building the \\"inclusive institutions\\" that enabled fast economic growth and strong political support. Fidel stayed in power by uniting Cubans against a common enemy, the imperialist United States (i.e., the extractive United Fruit Company) . Now that Cubans' fear of the United States has weakened and the economy has suffered due to the international recession, the revolutionary government is losing support.<br /><br />NPR's \\"Planet Money\\" did a series of stories about Haiti. One story followed a businessman's attempt to build a facility to put mangos into cardboard boxes so they wouldn't get bruised on the way to market. After two years his facility wasn't built because various people claimed to own the land, the deeds had been lost, and the villagers acted in their own selfish interests instead of seeing that selling unblemished mangoes would make everyone prosper. In contrast, in Cuba the government would have just built the facility in a few weeks. Acemoglu and Robinson talk about how a \\"strong central government\\" is needed before \\"inclusive institutions\\" can be fostered, but they fail to see that multiple factors are needed to create a strong central government with the \\"inclusive institutions\\" that limit the power of the elite.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|I have another pair similar but cheaper than these from Teva that needed repairing because the strap pulled out on one side. This design has the strap both entering the top and bottom of the soles...two soles. Looks like a promising design and will update...These fit me like a glove and are very comfortable yet very supporting and stress bearing. I found the arch support was in the perfect location (straps allow you to move your foot to locate properly on arch) but others I tried at a shoe store never felt like they aligned with my foot.
B005HEW7JG|5.0|This is my favorite of all Star Trek shows.<br />It is very diverse and very advanced, technology-wise<br />that even a techno nut like me can get lost sometimes!<br /><br />The first episode is brilliant and feels like a movie.<br />No over the top special effects that kills the story here.<br />But if you want action hop on over to Star Wars or Starship Troopers.<br />But if you like a good story come on here.<br />My friend would equate this as \\"Space soap Opera\\".
B00785P2QC|3.0|Have fun building but don't enjoy trying to accumulate the investment points, and you need them for just about everything in the game. Fun for a little while, but isn't a long term game for me. Started one evening and was caught up to the point of waiting on points by the next morning.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|We love this game it's so addicting.  We started with the free version and then bought it so we could play all the levels.  TIP: If you need a hint you can find them on YouTube.
B00792EGES|5.0|Alter Bridge is no doubt one of the greatest bands out there today, and this movie proves that. Not only is the music great (like always) but combined with the unprecedented video and audio quality that Blu Ray offers you get one of the greatest live videos created in the last 10 years. And about the whole swearing and cussing in the video, I personally don't mind it because I got this looking for a concert experience considering I am a whole ocean and another 50miles away from England, and that is part of the experience, this was obviously a big gig for the band and some things just get said. I can see why some wouldn't care for it because of the fact it is very unpredictable and wouldn't want to show their children because of that, but what would be different if they went to the concert. All in all this is a definite recommendation, the quality of the video and audio mixed with the expert video editing and filming, fused with the beautiful ROCK sound that Alter Bridge ever so awesomely delivers just makes this a must have for any fan or non-(soon to be) fan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun for all to be had here all day long just for fun or to keep your brain from turning to mush
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app!! i try and play it ever day so i get bonuses!! so much fun!! i wud recommend this to any one who just wants to have fun and a good time!
0743497465|4.0|I suppose with over 800 other reviewers, there is not much to say. However, I must say - wow. I found it almost as good as Angels and Demons though not quite as intriguing as The DaVinci Code.<br />The plot has been stated and restated, so I won't review it. I rated this book with just four stars because there are a a few too many cliques including the romance and the character of the Senator running for the Presidency. The President himself is quiet unlikely.<br />The information on NASA is fascinating as well as undersea exploration. The NASA budget information and problems really made me understand the huge money and politics involved in that agency.<br />As usual Brown has enough plots and subplots with twists on each one to keep the reading moving. Some authors can not go back and forth between the main plot and the subplots but Brown does it well and I never got lost.<br />I would recommend reading it if you like Brown's two major works.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|Sorry Nikon. Don't know why a battery grip that's made in China could cost so much. The box and packaging isn't even designed well. I thought I had purchased a grey market MB-D12 when it arrived at my doorstep.<br /><br />I bought this party because I needed better control over the camera and have a disability with my hands so needed it to operate the camera more effectively. Thats basically all you get except for 2 FPS more and extended battery life.<br /><br />If you bought a D800 I highly recommend you wait and purchase an aftermarket one when they become available.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I have read one other school shooting book before but this story has a unique vantage point and quite a few surprise twists.  It was hard for me (as well as the members of my book club) to \\"get into\\" the story as the author's style and verbage does not make this book an easy read.  I did however, finish the book and am anxious to see the movie adaptation.
B0009A21R6|5.0|The presence and quality of this seminal recording are present in this \\"you are there\\" recording!!  A wonderful SACD reissue!!!  I wish current artists would strive for such excellence!!  I look forward for more seminal SACD recordings...new or reissue!!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|last time I checked 2 player doesn't mean 3 players! I wanted to just play with two people I selected two player mode but when I got to the game the was a third player there and it wasn't a computer either so I couldn't play with just 2 people cuzthere was no one else to play the third player so I couldn't play :( would have been a good game but cud of this it was a waste of money please fix this and it will be a great game!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is very fun and addicting. you have to playtime unlock most of the levels so you want to keep playing. I would recommend this game to my friends. I like that all of the levels are different. there is always a challenge.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is a great comedy to watch.  Each show is about 20 min and so can get an entire show in even if busy.  Product was nicely packaged and in great shape when it arrrived.
B004FOA84A|5.0|My kids (6 and 3) never seem to get tired of this app.  Entertaining story with lots of puzzles to solve to find clues to locate where Grandpa disappeared to.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This album is amazing and will be winning many awards in the next year. I originally saw a few live videos on youtube and became a fan. The album definitely lived up to my expectations! Buy it now

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Several of my students were reading the books and told me how good they were, so I came home and downloaded it.  I couldn't put it down.  It was very well written and I loved it.  I am now on the third book of the series.  I def. recommmend it!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it is sooo fun but needs more updates, like 4th of july or mothers day or more easter or hanukah or even birday party
B001RIY4WE|5.0|My review is going to be short, and simple, for those of you who love the movie this is a must have. If you haven't seen it, then you should, it's one of the best movies James Cameron directed, If you're upgrading from DVD to Blu ray, the picture quality is amazing, and the option of selecting 3 different movie versions is beyond. I haven't had a look at the extras, but you need a code for the 3rd version EIGHT TWO NINE NINE SEVEN (8 2 9 9 7)  is the code. Over all, for the price, you can't beat this. It's an easy addition to a movie collection.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|WARNING: If you buy this Blue Ray, you will be addicted to Adele and find yourself playing it repeatedly, listening to the CD in your car continuously, and looking for all things Adele.<br /><br />I was in Best Buy and wandered into the high end speaker room where they were playing this outstanding DVD.  Sure, I saw her win a lot of awards, but I never really \\"heard\\" or paid any attention to her.<br /><br />The sound was great, of course, but what hooked me was the magnificent video production that pays her outstanding voice a wonderful compliment.  This was five days ago.  I can't stop watching the blue ray and I have the CD in the car which I downloaded to my iPhone so I literally listen to Adele every chance I get.  The salesman told me that he has sold more speakers because of the Blue Ray.  He almost got me, too.<br /><br />Ok, she curses, she uses an obscene gesture and tells off color stories - And?!<br /><br />She's authentic, talented, funny, very disarming.  I tell everyone I discovered her this weekend much the way Columbus discovered America.  I am sorry I had not heard of her earlier, perhaps I would have enjoyed the Grammy's more!
0345803485|1.0|I was actually excited to start reading this book, it sounded interesting and different than my usual tastes. Of course, by 'different' I mean creepy- erotica-S&M-sex-book. At first I was thinking, \\"Sure, I'm mature enough. Why not read something new?\\" Thus, I began reading Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One. It was sorta hot at first, but after awhile it just didn't sit well with me. The main character, Ana, falls into her 'submissive' role so easily. Maybe I have read too many books with strong, fierce heroines that I can't accept this submissive/dominant thing. A woman should be able to look into the eyes of the man she loves without getting whipped or flogged, or...canned. EW. I'm sorry but I just can't recommend this book, it truly left me nauseated.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Simplistic but enjoyable.  When new obtaining enough points to obtain new games makes life interesting.  This is also a sore point.  The discription of the games is often not good enough to know what you are getting.  Oh well.  The games are free and its interesting to<br />figure them out.<br /><br />The RJD
B00005221M|2.0|I am very upset with this version of Last of the Mohicans.  I love the movie, but the song \\"I Will Find You\\" is not in this version.  Why is that?
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I've got nothing to complain about. The cover is gorgeous, the commentary is great. I suppose some more features like deleted scenes would have been nice.
0545123275|5.0|Beautiful. Haunting. Heart breaking. I may be on the verge of sounding corny or already did, but these are the words that come to me when I think about this novel. I was well aware of both the positive and negative reviews before I began this novel, but I always try to ignore those opinions before reading a book. And I am so happy I gave this book a chance.<br /><br />What I loved about this novel? Pretty much everything. I loved the poetry in it. I loved the vivid sights, smells and sounds. I loved the romance that unfolded between Grace and Sam. It felt natural and didn't feel forced. I'm a huge wolf fan so maybe that aided in my fascination with this book. I think wolves are beautiful regal creatures. It's so weird because I used to know a girl who was attacked by a wolf once. She told me that ever since the attack, she's respected wolves highly. That kind of resembled Grace's story, too.<br /><br />I'm left speechless by this book.<br /><br />It would have been so easy for my lips to span the inches between our mouths. I thought I could hear the hope in her heartbeat: kiss me kiss me kiss me. Normally I was good at sensing others' feelings, but with Grace, everything I thought I knew was clouded by what I wanted.
0439023521|5.0|I read some of the one-star reviews and I was absolutely compelled to write a review. Let me start by saying that I am the kind of person that, if you tell me a book or a movie is sooo good, that almost guarantees that I will probably never see it. And in the off chance that I do, it's been so built up in my mind that it could never live up to its expectations. I had that experience with this book (and the series) only something very strange happened. This book far exceeded my expectations! I was very reluctant to read it, given its celebrity status, but on the recommendation of a very trustworthy friend, I picked up The Hunger Games on a Friday and finished Mockingjay by the following Friday. Being a lover and a writer of fiction myself, I was engaged and moved at various points throughout these books. Some say that there is a back story missing, I have no idea where they are getting that from- most characters are developed to the point where you can actually see them while you are reading and form an emotional bond with them. I would absolutely say that this book is a perfect storm of 1984 and V for Vendetta (two works of art that I love!) and I have no reservations saying that.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into the plot because I think the description of the story speaks for itself. But I do want to comment on those people who are criticizing Collins' grammar - see the beauty of a writer is that you are allowed to find your own voice and your own style. She has done that, beautifully might I add. I am actually a real stickler for grammatical errors and typos and they have actually been enough to make me put down a book, pick up a red pen and correct it myself. Collins' works are nothing like that, she has a style not unlike her contemporaries, and therefore there is something very familiar in the way that she tells the story.<br /><br />If you take issue with these books, perhaps you should look within yourself  and ask \\"Am I a book snob?\\" If the answer is yes, then please, get over yourself and get lost in a wonderful work of fiction! It's there for your enjoyment, so please, enjoy!
B005HSL626|5.0|kindle fire version is sweet!!  nuff said<br />I can't get enough of it makes breaks at work a blast just get it already! !
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I did know anything about this book until I was in the airport ready for a flight to Caracas when I saw a special issue of the Hunger Games in a People magazine. After that I decided I wanted to read it before the movie arrives. I barely had an idea of what it was about. I knew that the author was inspired from channel surfing on television (reality shows and the invasion of Iraq). That really called my attention. At the begining it was a little bit slow, but the information is useful to understand the hunger games world, but once the Games start I couldn't take it down. The end of this first book leaves you with a huge willing of reading the next one right away.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reading plans and the multiple different versions of the Bible. You can even set up daily reminders.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This DVD was terrific. It is detailed, organized, and well presented. It covered the beginnings and the development of the 2008 financial catastrophe. It certainly spreads the blame around but points out the tremendous and corrupting influence that Wall Street has in Washington, and how little has been done to mitigate any future repetitions. It shows again how the actions of the powerful and greedy destroy the lives and dreams of the working class, the middle class. I am somewhat embarrassed and definitely ashamed to have ever declared myself as an conservative Republican.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is ok but you have to get coins to unlock different games.so besides that it is a pretty good app
0763644765|3.0|The book is cute, but even my one year old has tired of it quickly.  Not one of her go-to books for the potty.
B004ZJZQ7O|5.0|[[ASIN:B001EIOOVS American Gangster [Blu-ray]]].<br />Very good action/drama movie based on a true story, which makes it even more interesting.<br />Top notch performances by Denzel Washingron and Russell Crowe.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game. the unlocking system really keeps you hooked and the increasing difficulty keeps you trying over and over again.
B001FES0IE|4.0|The album jacket is an unlaminated cheaper version of the original, but the vinyl itself sounds great! It came on time, and I am happy with the purchase.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great app. I recommend to everyone! but i wish store had more perks though, but everything else is great! very addicting
B007PTJOV0|4.0|a lot of my close friends have it so I got it,  I thought it would be stupid but I have become addicted to killing those snails but they kill me more then I kill them :(
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app makes reading and studying the Bible very easy. Love that there are free full versions available for download when internet access is not an option. Love checking out different translations and I use the bookmark and note taking features a lot. It syncs with my iPad and other devices, so I always have access to my notes and don't lose my place! Several great reading plans, and special features like Easter week and Advent studies. Not much to complain about with this Bible app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books I have read next to Harry Potter.<br />This book is set in the future in North America, there are 12 districts.!(There were 13 but that district was destroyed) Every year they randomly pick 2 people as tribunes(a boy and a girl).Prim Everdeen(Katniss' sister has her name in for a tribune only 1 time so Katniss' is almost sure she wont get picked. When the ceramony begins ,girls are picked first, Prim is picked,but Katniss volenters as tribune in place of her sister, The boys are picked next,and its Peeta Mellark,the bakers son.  Katniss goes into training with her 2 mentors:Effie Trinket and a guy named Haymitch. For the next couple of days the tribunes train for the games. Then when the games begin the 24 tribunes all die 1 by 1. Then left last to win are Katniss and Peeta. Who by then are really in love! But Katniss isn't sure if she likes him or her best friend Gale Hawthorne at home who is her hunting partner.<br />The Hunger Games is to teach the people in the districts not to repelled against the capitol so they are sacrificing kids from the ages 12-18 to fight for the death,and everybody in all of the capitols will be watching them!<br /><br />I loved the Hunger Games and I cant wait till I read the next two books in the series: Catching Fire and Mockingjay.<br />This book has a lot of details it goes very well into explanation about things. If you are to go see the movie I would recommend you to read the book first because you might seem a little confused at the movies.
0385344228|3.0|From the get go the kid creeped me out, but that doesnt make a killer. I never felt bad for Jacob though I felt his parents. I got a little irritated at the flaws in the system and the reluctant friends.  Well written and interesting but a bit slow and dark -- though it did prompt heated discussions among the people with kids who read it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I'm not much of a gamer, and I'm not a big fan of shooters. I'm definitely not as good as my brother, who can naturally shoot any arcade game. However, this game was easy to understand and fun to play. If you read a review on how it doesn't tell the details on upgrades, all you need to know is that it makes your gun more powerful. I give this game 5 stars for superior gameplayability and graphics. It is worth way more than $1.99!
B000JQUKKU|4.0|Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol is a must for anyone's Kindle collection. It is just as good in Kindle format as it is in the book. Simply timeless!
B005LAIH9K|5.0|This movie was great! Another helping of the original American Pie recipe. None of that store bought crap like Band camp, Naked mile, or any of those other stupid spinoffs. Sorry for the pie puns, but this movie just delivered as great as its three prequels. The original cast is back and just as great as ever. The story's interesting, raunchy, keeps you watching every second to see what happens next, and reminds you of the good times like before and gives you some hilarious new ones as well. Don't want to give out any spoilers, so if you like the first three, definitely see this movie. The only cons I found through the whole thing was that some of the original minor characters only had a couple lines or so. But they're minor for a reason. I really hope they put out a boxed bluray quadrilogy, but then again, they might not be done yet as the ending sort of hints to a possible sequel. Maybe an American Wedding 2? !!!!!Here's to hoping!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love all the diffrent games.  diffrent but inba good way. I difinatly recomend. sorry aboit all the typos. to tierd to correct.

B001NLKT60|4.0|Loved this book.  They way Stieg Larsson weaves his stories, and then slowly unravels them, is captivating. I had a hard time putting this down.  There were a few things that seemed like disconnects when I finished, but I have a feeling they will play a role in the third book of the series.  I just wish the author had lived long enough to write the entire series as he intended.

Dr. Wilson has campaigned tirelessly on behalf of respect for the life of the earth, and for humans to follow the course of angels rather than devils.<br />His writing is cogent, interesting and compelling. My only regret is that i was not able to have him as my PhD advisor. He is a hero and a wonderful human being and scholar.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this game. the only prob is the games cost so much it takes forever to get new gamed
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the ease of operation and the graphics when I win. This is one of the games I play daily.

B007R41E8O|5.0|amazing game! works great on the kindle fire. this game is exactly what I was looking for. it has everything from great fun puzzles to figure out looking for a list of objects and a great story line that gets you hooked from the very beginning. this is a must buy game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes it easier for me to connect with the Word regularly and to share the Word of God. Love it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Okay, the game is great and is exactly what I hoped for. What many people complain aboutbis the lack of levels, but that's just because the app is so new. I got this on opening day and beat all the levels two days later, and am still waiting for world 3, but we must be patient! in the original Angry Birds, if you got it opening day as well, you'd know there was only two or three worlds also... we have to supply the developers!
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|No this isn't \\"The River\\" or \\"Born to Run.\\" But this is, lyrically at least, a \\"tour de force\\" of a legend who could easily rest on his lofty laurels. It isn't just his portrayal of the catastrophic results of the skullduggery of the \\"Robber Barons\\" and \\"Fat Cats,\\" but his vision of what just might happen again that is so troubling. Songs like \\"Death of My Home Town\\" displays a rage that matches his earlier work and an insight into the machinations of the Power Elite- but this isn't just about \\"Jersey,\\" now, it's about our country, culture and the calamitous effects of globalization and greed in general!<br /><br />I think that this isn't considered a great work of protest art says more about the audience than the work itself. I see, and here, \\"Wrecking Ball\\" as a masterpiece for its genre, equaling not only his earlier work, but more like the early, Woody Guthrie inspired, Bob Dylan that initially Bruce was thought to be, and has finally become- and maybe even a little bit more prolific and profound!

B001JNNDGA|1.0|I've seen the movie when it first came to theaters with a christian youth group. I wish I could get that time back. The ideas behind movies like this are what drove me away from religion. Enjoy your profit, Mr. Gibson.
B004W89N72|4.0|It was a good appt. It was perfect for what I needed it for. I had to delete it, because I needed space or I would have keep it.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|Having seen the original series (all three) it's a wonder anyone would bother with a remake, especially when this is so pale a copy. Craig must have been bored to take on this project and completely miscast. The male role is no way a man of action either in the books or the orginal films, and the female lead is so vanilla in this I could not help but think of 'Rebbeca of Sunnybrook Farm with a Tattoo.\\"
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all the books in the Hunger Games series. The end did not fail to disappoint! I was glad to see Katniss take care of business on all fronts. There were some characters lost that I was disappointed to see go, but in the world of Panem it wasn't really surprising to see it happen. Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|use it for on the go ideas, grocery lists, to do's and more. Automatic sync to lap top, and tablet makes for easy access to my idea's. absolutely love this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so sad to see Katniss thrown back into the hunger games, but not at all surprised that the capital did it, nor that she came out of it again! A great read, I highly recommend. Though, if anyone read and loved the Hunger Games, they don't need my recommendation, they've already bought Catching Fire!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I love this movie. I've watched it a couple of times now and I never tire of it. Meryl Streep is excellent here as the slave-driving magazine editor. I love the fashion too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first one, I continued to love the story as it continued in the second book. I lost many an hour of sleep reading this series, because I just wanted to see what was coming next. I agree with some of the criticism that the editing needs a bit of work, but I wonder if that may have been addressed now that the book has been re-released. Overall, a fun, sexy read, just like the first one.
B0000252YK|2.0|This is (according to my opinion of course) the worst album of Ozzy. Besides Shot in The Dark (which is a really good track) and Killer Of Giants the rest songs are really boring and there are no catchy melodies so you can enjoy singing.I can say that the rest songs are just fillers to this unfortunately bad Album. If you have his best of cd which includes Shot In The Dark there is no point in buying this album. The sound and production of this album is like Bark At the Moon production. Its a little bit old but it sounds good. Personally i like the sound of 80s. The problem is in the compositions. Trust me you probably would not like this album. Only for collectors of Ozzy Osbourne's music.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham just continues to write excellent novels.  I think this may become one of my favorites because the topics were so relevant to today!
B004X80QNG|3.0|The good: this app has the best calendar/task user interface I've seen.  I have hated every other mobile calendar app I've tried, until i tried Pocket Informant.  I Love the sorting abilities for tasks, and the ability to &quot;roll them up&quot; into categories.<br />The bad: No MS Exchange sync is a huge drawback.  I had to reconfigure my phone to sync my calendar through the native Android calendar, which is buggy and unreliable.  appointments moved or deleted through PI would not change on my main Outlook calendar.  Likewise, i had to reconfigure my Outlook sync setup and buy 3rd party software to sync my computer's task list through Toodledo...all so I could sync to PI tasks.  This was very cumbersome, but i did this for a while so I could get the superior interface of PI.  But after struggling with buggy syncing for both tasks and calendar over several month, I felt the better interface wasn't worth it.  i went back to Touchdown with my calendar and task syncing.  TD isnt as pretty as PI, and lacks a lot of the interface functions of PI, but it has direct exchange sync and is far more dependable and sccurate in syncing.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Like many before me, I almost passed on this movie due to the horrible trailers. But, being a Burroughs fan for over 50 years, I felt obligated to see the movie. I'm thrilled that I did...this is the best movie I've seen in fifty years, bar none.<br /><br />At first, I questioned the casting and was not overly thrilled with the tattoos on Lynn Collins.  But, she proved to be a mesmerizing Dejah Thoris and 'made' the film. Her character was well played and believable. Her smallish figure was ideal, considering the physiology and biology of the Martians (read the books).<br /><br />I left the theater very happy.  In fact, I convinced my wife to see it again with me on the following week-end. (I may try to see it again this week-end.) I will buy the video...in fact, I will probably upgrade to blu-ray, now that I have a video worthy of the expense of a new video player.<br /><br />Anyone who rated this movie poorly, either was not watching, had an agenda, or does not like good, foundational, science fiction. Disney made a huge marketing blunder with what could well be the next big 'franchise'. The trailers should have had more Dejah Thoris, and a 'voice over' to lay the foundation of the history, culture, and ecology of the Burroughs' Mars.<br /><br />My only wish was that they had a cameo of Thuvia in it, since they played the Therns so heavily.<br /><br />Again, the best movie I've ever seen in fifty years and only the second I've ever paid to see in a theater more than once. See it while you can and buy the video.<br /><br />[...]
B0000DC13U|3.0|This film by Jean-Luc Godard shows the Rolling Stones in the studio as they prepare to record \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\". Godard, being very political, interspersed the Stones segments with scenes of Black Panther types handling rifles and reading from revolutionary texts in junkyards as blonde, bound women march through, and various other controversial passages; sometimes the two parts of the film bleed together, with the sounds of the Stones recording going over the political skits, or the sounds of the political skits heard as we watch the boys recording. Contrast or comparison? The Stones at that point had not even released \\"Street Fighting Man\\", which was on the Beggar's Banquet album along with \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", and were in fact coming out of the disastrous Their Satanic Majesty's Request experience when they didn't tour at all, but gearing up for a multi-media assault that included two comeback albums (Beggar's Banquet and Sticky Fingers), a tour of the US, the Gimme Shelter movie, the Cocksucker Blues movie, the Ladies And Gentlemen The Rolling Stones movie, Stanley Booth's book The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones, various magazine articles, photographers and filmmakers everywhere, not to mention the Rolling Stones Rock `n' Roll Circus movie, the death of Brian Jones, the Hyde Park free concert, and Altamont. One Plus One came together at the start of this heady three year burst of activity and creativity that ended with Exile on Main Street, the band's best album.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film we see the band in a massive, massive studio, full of guitars, pianos, and multi-coloured partitions. There are people hanging about, squads of anonymous helper dudes smoking away, and then among them there's Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Keith Richards. Cool. The band is bored, Mick is demonstrating his song, its mysterious three chords, Bryan seeming to contribute some cool jamming (he was criticised for being belligerent and hard to work with at this time), but we don't see him much throughout. Bill looking extra bored, lounging in a pink outfit with pink leather cowboy boots, playing bass chords. Nicky Hopkins in the foreground. Keith has his solo thought through early on, we hear snatches of it already well before they even get the rest of the beat properly together. Second run-through has samba with organ, eith on bass. Keith's shirt open. Great feeling of space in the huge studio, great lighting, Mick smokes and sings. Church organ version, Brian on guitar.<br /><br />The film cuts to a group of interviewers following Eve Democracy through a forest asking vague questions that she answers with a yes or a no. \\"Do you feel exploited when you step into an interview?\\" Yes. \\"Is there a good way to conduct an interview?\\" No. \\"Are drugs a spiritual form of gambling?\\" There are scenes of people spraypainting slogans on the wals - SOVIETKONG, etc. There's a weird bookstore scene where people take books as if to purchase them, but instead of paying for them with money they have to slap two prisoners in the face before they can leave the store with their books. Junkyard press conference with two funky female journalists. At the end there's a beach scene, with a film crew, people with guns chasing each other along the beach as the crane dolley picks it all up, as the studio version of the film plays.<br /><br />Back in the sessions, Keith does a blues intro to the song. Brian's guitar is not plugged in, he's wailing away, but nothing can be heard. Something fishy was going on there. Later Charlie gets the rhythm, Bill is on congas, Nicky Hopkins in the grand piano, Mick on bongo. On the second day, all others are wearing different clothes, but Bill is still in his pink outfit. The band messes on the \\"No Expectations\\" riff. Bill later changes to a red jacket, plays guitar, Charlie in a yellow leather jacket, Keith's funky jam on a Les Paul. The sessions wear on. What's not caught on film is that, at some point, the hot lights set the studio on fire and it burns the ground, not before someone can salvage the smoking pile of tapes. Wow!e hot lights set the studio on fire and it burns the ground, not before someone can salvage the smoking pile of tapes. Wow!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I do not know why they sell a striped down version for the android, but the game gets boring fast without the Zen garden or survival mode. They should tell you they are not included before you purchase 1/2 of the game thinking you are getting the full version.
B004KA9VGA|4.0|This was one of those novels that surprised me. It's a story of witches and vampires ...oh and daemons with a few humans chucked in...for adults (I mean grown-ups, not because it's erotic or anything). It makes you think because it's all so plausible. Watch a witch become the love interest of a centuries-old vampire and you'll want more. Don't get me wrong, this isn't Twilight - the vampire is not all sugar and raisins. He's like a block of ice to touch for a start while he and his family are not far removed from Bram Stoker. This story takes the reader on a journey of discovery into a parallel universe (even though they all live amongst us), and into the preparation of a battle for survival - the actual battle will be in the sequel, I believe. Take a look around you - that guy in the corner just might be a daemon. And your favorite professor at college could juuuuuusttt be a vampire.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I decided to read this book out of curiosity, and because I like the title which makes me think of red roses, chocolates, champagne and silk sheets.  I was curious about the work of the author, whose \\"A Tale of Two Sisters\\" in the three - story anthology \\"Where's My Hero?\\", I enjoyed a tiny bit more than my favorite author's (who is the reason why I bought the anthology).  I thought, maybe, since I enjoyed the Julia Quinn novella, I would find reading a full Julia Quinn historical romance novel a thoroughly enjoyable activity.  Her book, \\"Ten Things I Love About You\\" is hilarious, witty, and charming.  But still, I thought, is she really that good?  Hence, \\"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\\".  The book spent four weeks in the New York Times bestseller list, was a finalist in the 2003 RITA (Romance is Treasured Always) awards for Best Long Historical Romance given by the Romance Writers of America (RWA), and voted by RWA as one of 2002's Top Ten favorites, among other achievements which readers may find out at Julia Quinn's website.<br />  The main characters of the story are Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington.  Colin Bridgerton is described in the book as a most sought after bachelor who tops the list as a desirable husband in abundant possession of looks, fortune, and charm.  He is thirty - three, addicted to traveling, and has absolutely no interest in snagging a wife.  Penelope Featherington, on the other hand, has been in love with Colin since two days before her sixteenth birthday.  She is twenty - eight, a spinster (by 19th century England standard), and regarded by Mister Bridgerton as his sister's best friend who is just...simply there, like a house plant one passes by every day and notices once in a while, at times when pointed out by the lady of the house or some other resident of the abode.  In other words, she is an unremarkable single woman.<br />  Other prominent characters in the story are Eloise Bridgerton, Lady Danbury, Portia Featherington, Violet Bridgerton, Felicity Bridgerton, and Lady Whistledown.  Eloise Bridgerton, Penelope's best friend, happens to be Colin's favorite sister. She, like our heroine, is a spinster (but by choice) and occupies her time by writing letters to anyone she could think of.  Lady Danbury is a terribly outspoken old lady whose company everyone tries to avoid.  This old lady, however, is more astute than most people and sees that there is more to Penelope than meets the eye.  Portia Bridgerton is Penelope's mother.  She is resigned to the fact that Penelope is a spinster and looks forward to growing old with her third daughter at her side, catering to her needs.  Her project is to marry off her fourth daughter - to Colin Bridgerton.  Violet Bridgeton, our hero's mother, is set to accomplish her major goal of seeing all her eight children married. Her focus at the moment is, of course, Colin.  Felicity Bridgerton is the fourth and youngest of the Featherington brood.  She is an affectionate and supportive sister to Penelope.  Lady Whistledown is a mysterious society writer whose column about her observations of the British le bon ton has everyone salivating to read each edition of her paper.<br />  \\"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\\" is a regency historical romance novel.  It is set in nineteenth century England featuring life of British high society in the 1800's.  The le bon ton resided in the districts of St. James and Mayfair in London.  Penelope lives with her family on one of the rows of houses in Mount Street, which is a short walk to Berkeley Square while the unmarried Bridgerton women live with their mother at number five  Bruton Street along the edge of the square.  Colin, however, maintains an apartment in Bedford Square where the working class is concentrated.<br />  The book provides many occasions to smile and laugh, and most importantly, to tingle from head to toe, which I believe, is a must in a worth - reading romance novel.  Romance novels usually relate how a boy meets a girl.  The said boy and girl fall in love.  Then they live happily ever after.  In the novel, Mister Bridgerton does not even remember how he met Miss Featherington!  But he falls in love with her, anyway.  It is not the struck-by-lightning type of falling-in-love.  More like a dawning kind of falling-in-love, like the sun creeping up in the horizon slowly tinting the sky with yellow hues until it takes over the dark with blinding brilliance.  However, Penelope finds that Colin harbors a secret.  Our hero was not happy about being found out.  Then, he discovers that Penelope has a secret of her own.  Her secret is more scandalous than his and awakens dark feelings that he did not know he possessed.  Of course, Mister Bridgerton and Miss Featherington found a way to dispel the negative consequences of their secrets.  The novel ends like all romance novels do - hero and heroine, happy together.<br />  So, there you are.  Romancing Mister Bridgerton is a romantic novel full of wit and humor.  Julia Quinn is really really good.  Historical romance readers, like me, will undoubtedly find the book a very enjoyable read.  I highly recommend it.  In fact, I recommend the whole series. I have read every Bridgerton novel by Julia Quinn and none disappointed.

0439023521|3.0|I picked up the book on Kindle due to all of the recommendations from friends and acquaintances. It was an interesting read although, I feel that I should say something about the exceedingly poor grammar. Not only are there run-on sentences, but numerous fragments. At multiple points she changes present and past tenses in the same phrase.<br /><br />It was so bad in places that I had to re-read the page over and over again just to figure out what exactly had occurred. I was surprised to learn that this was written by an accomplished adult. I'm not saying an author must have perfect grammar. I also know that sometimes questionable grammar is used for dramatic effect. However, this story is so poorly written I had assumed this was a first attempt of an adolescent author.<br /><br />I would also like to give a word of warning to parents. Due to its content this is not a book I would recommend for young readers. I believe that you should read it and decide for yourselves before letting your children read this book.

B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Predjudice is probably my favorite movie of all time. It is humorous, and romantic, yet it is appropriate for most ages. It also teaches about first impressions and the importance of not jumping to conclusions. The acting was superb, and there could be no better actors chosen for the different parts. I highly recommend this movie.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished the trilogy of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay; the first I bought as Amazon had a very good price on it and I truly liked it although I don't like post-apocalyptic stories.  I just had to see what the younger set was reading and it had been highly recommended.  BTW, I'm 70+.  It was so good I had to read the others and borrowed them through Amazon's Prime program and they paid for the cost for the year.  A truly outstanding work and I didn't know they were even filming it when I first read it...well worth the price as this author is truly outstanding.  The first book is outstanding and could stand alone; but the story is incomplete without the other two and I was truly surprised at the twists and turns....
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I think this is a awesome game so worth 2.99$ get it it is so cool toy need it peace
B003K16P3M|4.0|This book was fun and well written- in fact, the writing was better toward the end of the book than it was at the beginning. The characters were interesting, I became invested in the main male character moreso than the female character (which never happens). I also enjoyed the fact that I couldn't always tell where the plot was going/ what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Well written, lots of fun, worth the price of admission.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was suggested by a friend of mine who is a therapist. It has become one of my favorite family movies. Don't want to give anything away but I would encourage anyone looking for a positive motivational family movie to get this movie and add it to you library. It reiterates how precious life is and how every member of the family is needed to make it whole.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. It worked flawlessly on my HTC Thunderbolt &amp; was just the right length &amp; difficulty to keep me engaged.
0345803485|1.0|I stuck with this whole book, because friends of mine told me that it was so engaging and had such a great end.  I kept waiting for the book to become \\"good.\\"  I HATED this book and was pleased to see it end (and have no desire to read the other 2 books in the trilogy). I kept thinking that there would be some big revelation/epiphany moment in the end, but it was the same boring drivel of which the rest of the book consisted.  There is essentially no plot to this book, and the characters are not compelling in the least.  They act like they have such a complicated relationship, but it has no depth and is ridiculously repetitive.  80% of the plot is to describe graphic sex scenes which are redundant and way too detailed to be erotic.  The best writers create sensuality by not explicitly detailing every groan, moan, and pubic hair placement.  It might make sense to have 1 or 2 very explicit sexual scenes, but when describing them takes up 80% of the book, you have a book with no plot...<br />The other 20% of the book where the characters aren't having graphic sex, they are sending corny e-mails to each other that fail to be amusing and having the same boring conversation about their relationship of 3 weeks (which they always seem to be surprised when the other person is bringing up the same points over and over), or the lead female character is commenting on how \\"gorgeous\\" the male character is (which she does so about 500 times).  She also comments on her \\"inner goddess\\" about 250 times, and they talk about how \\"when she bites her lips and this turns the male character on\\" about 100 times, and \\"how if she rolls her eyes at him she will get a spanking\\" about 75 times.<br />Besides the fact that this book is poorly written, not interesting, repetitive & boring, and pornographic at times, I also think it creates a disturbing picture of what is acceptable behavior towards females.  The female character finds that she is very turned on by abusive behavior by the male, andI think that this sends a disturbing message to young females trying to figure out how they want to be treated by their significant others, as well as to men in that \\"this is what females want.\\"  Somehow, the male's behavior is justified to the female because \\"he is just so gorgeous,\\" which is why she seems to tolerate it.  She's afraid that he will \\"leave\\" if she doesn't accept it.  She appears to have no other reason for liking him besides the fact that he is \\"beautiful,\\" and for this, she will tolerate abusive and stalking-like behavior.

B004EPZ03O|2.0|Like a lot of people my age I grew up with the muppets, first weened on [[ASIN:B0009ULBGS The Muppet Show: Season One]] and then their series of excellent movies in the 80's, which lead to lesser movies of the 90's and TV movies of the 00's, somewhere along the way we had muppet babies too. I take a great deal of pride in my love of the muppets, more than any grown man in his thirties probably should, but I suspected that Jason Siegal did more so. He did a loving and funny homage to the gang fronted by Kermit the Frog in his star vehicle [[ASIN:B001L2IFVM Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Unrated)]], so I had high hopes and a good feeling when I learned that he was writing this new incarnation for a new generation. Alas, the writing just may be this movies biggest flaw. It's packed with weak jokes, recycled from old muppet shows and films, a storyline that is blah, and new characters who are flat (even by muppet standards) and uninteresting.<br /><br />Take the new muppet and central character of the film, I hesitate to call him a hero, his name is Walter and he is neither funny nor interesting. He seems like a reject muppet character who finally landed a role because he's friends with the director or the writer(!). Though Siegal himself fairs little better, with dumb jokes and a bland personality, poor Amy Adams, a great talent who looks confused much of the time, but still does her best to put her game face on and seems at home in her musical numbers. Chris Cooper, an Oscar winner is the one dimensional villain, with an unimaginative name, Tex Richman, he's also not funny, but he does keep a straight face while performing a misguided rap number. There are also a lot of pointless cameos, why James Carvell(?), I don't even think that most of them are meant to be funny.<br /><br />There are charming moments, a lot of smiles, but few genuine laughs. Kermit and the gang are always welcome visitors for me, but it takes Kermie twenty minutes to even show up in this movie and Miss Piggy has more an extended guest appearance, she's also not voiced by her muppeteer maestro Frank Oz. The last act when they finally put a proper muppet show works best, it nearly made this movie worth it for me, but it was a long time coming and it still wasn't exactly perfect. I wont give up on the muppets and this is a clean family friendly movie, I hope they do better next time, while I didn't dislike the movie, I can't recommend it to anyone, even muppet die hards because it is just too uneven.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|bookshelves: 1st-in-series, adult, chic-lit, fiction, own-kindle, romance, single, young-adult<br /><br />Recommended for: For Parents to READ along with TEENS!<br />Read on April 04, 2012, read count: 1<br /><br />HOW TO TELL IF YOUR PARTNER IS ABUSIVE:<br /><br />Does your partner:<br />* Have a bad and unpredictable temper?<br />* Hurt you, or threaten to hurt or kill you?<br />* Threaten to commit suicide if you leave?<br />* Say he/she can't live without you?<br />* Force you to have sex?<br />* Destroy belongings?<br />* Act excessively jealous and possessive?<br />* Constantly check up on you?<br />* Never want you to leave his/her side?<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is like a car wreck blocking half the road. You don' want to jam traffic up any more than it already is but you can't help but to slow down and take a look at all the damage that was done.<br /><br />It was impossible for me to put the book down until the very end. It was as if McGuire herself has somehow found her way into my memories I had locked away long ago yet somehow my own self preservation will never let me forget. So for me Beautiful Disaster was my car wreck. I had no choice but to slow down and look for the damage throughout. Only where I never saw a happy ending-- it seems Abby get hers. I was split in two; the romantic side of me was in complete ahh. However, the realistic side of me was latterly spent a massive amount of time yelling at my kindle.<br /><br />Yes the story is a fictitious one and I know this, yet McGuire breaths so much truth and life into the fabric of the pages it made my stomach churn in fear as I held my breath waiting for the turn of the page where Travis would finally snap and all hell would break loose in Abby's world.<br /><br />Travis is the male lead that you want to hate, love and feel sympathy for. His womanizing ways made me sick. His rash temper and possessiveness made me hate him. Then when his past is revealed, I had a wave of sympathy for him but I couldn't get past his personality.<br /><br />NOTE TO ALL READERS: VISIT ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WEBSITES FOR THE SIGNS TO TELL IF YOUR PARTNER IS ABUSIVE!!!<br /><br />Then there is Abby-- Don't even get me started. I was once in her shoes. She might have got her happy ending but if the story continues and for all young adult readers worldwide I pray the McGuire will continue. But how long can Abby's happy ever after last? At some point I the rose colored glasses that have been warn throughout this book need to be removed. Because I am sorry to say but without meds for Travis and deep, very deep therapy for both Abby and Travis this coupling is headed down a long dark path no woman wants to walk.<br /><br />Now let us visit the supporting characters or should I say blind enablers. It's supposed to be the ones on the outside of the relationship looking in that sees the relationship for what it is because they are not wearing the rosy glasses. It seems as though America has a death wish for her best friend. Who the hell needs a friend like that? Not Abby that much is clear. However, in the beginning Shapley, Travis cousin was the only one with brains trying to keep Abby clear if him. Then somewhere along the line his stupid ass drank the Kool-aide and dawned his own rosy glasses.<br /><br />It may seem as though I am hating on Beautiful Disaster's but I'm not. It is a story that needs to be told and at this point needs to continue. Because yes some woman drink the Kool-Aide while wearing rosy glasses and think they can save the one they love and in the end they can't.<br /><br />Travis has some redeemable characteristic but in reality that is not enough. The story sends a powerful message but not the one I was expecting. It has a fairy-tale ending and that bothers me. Knowing my own daughters and young impressionable girls around the world are reading this and may one day find them self's in the same situation and think they too can have the fair-tale ending they read about.<br /><br />My advice...

B0000AM6JI|5.0|I'm slowly but surely going through every movie Al Pacino has ever been in. I've seen most of them at least once on TCM or AMC and now I'm getting the DVD's.<br /><br />Not even close to my favorite Al Pacino movie, but it's still well above the typical run of the mill movie that doesn't have Al Pacino in it. He's a great actor and knows how to pick his parts.

0143114085|1.0|Hated, hated, absolutely hated this book.  The writing style was disjointed, choppy, and incoherent.  I skipped through large portions and only just stuck until the end because I wanted to see if what I knew was going to happen did - and it did.  Won't bother reading this author again.
B00756GKBA|3.0|the cover art sets the tone and is a interesting indicator of what m has in store for us. we have a beautiful image of what resembles madonna, hidden behind a frame of multicolored glass. Madonna is obscured through bright colors and lights and her true essence remains hidden. And so goes the album, and the listener is pelted from start to finish with nonstop flash and pizazz but is ultimately left wanted more.<br /><br />Much was said about Hard Candy, but the reality was that the album was a perfect M record. It had all the gumption of past efforts, as M framed herself as a sort of Hip Hop queen B ready to ready to sexualize and conquer the listener, but only after getting down on the dance floor. She also was wise enough to have the taste to bring the Neptunes and Timbaland on board, and they actually pushed her voice and sound and gave her a new life line. This time she foolishly sets her eyes on Martin Solvieg, who has made a number of hits on the club scene...but who has a style akin to schoolyard chants being shoved through a vocoder...it sounds like a kidzbop record. The formula is tired, as is the whole dance electro vibe Madonna attempts on this record. She did electro pop already, and it was in every way more interesting on the Music album! Why, why in the word would an intelligent, sophisticated and cultured mother of four select a song titled \\"gimme all your luvin\\" as a lead single, let alone an album track? And don't even get me started on the unfortunately titled \\"gang bang\\". That track of course samples a bit of dub step. Oh, how coincidental! If bridge jumping goes into style, we'll be forced to tie madonna down as surely she'd follow that equally repelling trend. And since I consider her a national treasure, I want her to live to die another day, and instead give her a chance to redeem herself for this album!<br /><br />Gang Bang, despite its blase attention grabbing title, actually proves to be a solid highlight of the record, with a pulsating beat and madonna amping up a decent dose of femme fatale. I'm a sinner and girl gone wild continue the classic madonna theme of religious sacrilege disguised as pop music...and with these two tracks we are shown an strong example of not only her humor but also her trademark sound...which is fun, light dance music with a hint of resentment towards the church. This theme harkens back to her like a prayer days and implies that her soul is still not at rest, but her search for spirituality is not made clear in the songs or even explored in a truly compelling way..it is simply bottled up and used as fodder to fill up the writing on a lyrics sheet.<br /><br />Take a listen to any of her vocals on this record, and then go back and listen to simply anything from her 80's catalouge. No matter what the material, she actually sang with a sense of passion and hunger. Hunger to keep the listener paying attention...but with every track on this record she does not seem to have an ounce of passion or joy. Even drenched with autotune, you don't get the sense she fully stands behind the material. In the past people payed attention to her because she brought a sense of professionalism to her role as pop queen, but with this album you get the sense the fire is dying and it's sad. Does she no longer care? Is this music a true representation of who madonna is or is it a insincere image that she is utilizing to hold onto her crown? This woman has recorded undisputed pop classics....surely she can do better.<br /><br />Madonna should be respected however for making another relevant album, as it is a solid assimilation of the current trend, which is corporatized, calculated pop. But at least she is still willing to swing the bat!  While Janet has taken to self help books and Mariah has been so desperate as to embrace jenny craig, Madonna has refused to settle and let herself go...with this record she again makes a play to culturally imprint herself. But I would like her to really be the leaderthat she is and reinvent the wheel, instead of lowering herself into competing with the current crop of teenyboppers. Hopefully this is just something she is doing to pay the bills....or perhaps she can use it to fund her upcoming presidential run?
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love to edit photographs but hats being stuck to my laptop all day. I downloaded this and many others and found this one to have a good rage of content. Only thing I don't like about it is that when I go to add my pictures from my Kindle Fire it wont let me. Instead it brings me back to the picture option screen. I usually have to grab pictures from my Fb page. I hope this gets a fix soon because I really do like this software.
0316743003|4.0|While the paperback edition is of rather cheap paper and print, the content and the corresponding price of the book more than makes up for it. It's Ben's first hand account of his years at Lochheed's Skunk Works, under the firm grip of Kelly Johnson and then as head of the Skunk Works, telling his personal view about the declassified programs (at the time of writing) he was involved in. The F-117 was Ben's brainchild, and the reader gets a priviledged insight into all the work that went into this remarkable airplane. While there are a few chapters where Ben takes the freedom to stray away from the main subject of this book, overall this cannot really detract from the very interesting story-line.<br />While this is not the definitive history of the Skunk Works, it will take the reader into a world not known to many, and it will not be easy for you to lay it down until finished - recommended.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ugh!  I couldn't even finish this book.  Such sick behavior should not be glorified in a novel.  The sex was disturbing and painful. The lead character is not believable. On the one hand she's supposed to be young, innocent,and smart.  Yet she likes to have sex with a guy that basically rapes her and wants her to live a life under his total dictatorship. I thought she might get smart and leave, and then the guy might turn around and be a better lover. But no. As others have said, it's just the same thing over and over.<br /><br />Now, it's okay (even riveting) to have a sexy romantic novel with the characters in various sex acts which get hotter as it goes, building up to even some kinky sex acts.  But  it's an entirely uninteresting story when there's no real love between them, and all they do is rough kinky sex right from the get-go. All at the expense of a young women's self esteem and innocence.  How sick!  I wanted to reach in that book and shake that girl!  Wake up you idiot! There are much better guys (good-looking too) in the world. And they know how to treat a woman.<br /><br />I can't believe this book was written by a woman! It has male erotica all over it. Maybe it's just me, but I like a little romance in my romance novel.  This is not romance!

B0073XORLU|5.0|You have to give Ian Anderson credit for having the huge balls to do a sequel to the greatest concept album in rock history. Thick As A Brick, released in 1972, is a monumental achievement in progressive rock in my view. Let's face it, Yes, King Crimson and even -- dare I say it -- Pink Floyd never produced anything as brilliant. So as Ian Anderson set about the production of a new album to tell the story of the fictional, child prodigy Gerald Bostock (and supposed genius behind the words of the first one) and how his life might have turned out, the stakes were mighty high. Does \\"Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson Thick As A Brick 2\\" measure up to the classic? No, it would be near impossible to meet that mark. This album is also no Minstrel In The Gallery, Songs From The Wood or Aqualung. It's a different beast, but still manages to incorporate the familiar features of Tull and Anderson's best work. There's lots of Ian's wonderful flute playing and that is most welcome. Thick As A Brick 2 rocks really hard in spots, but has some lovely, quiet acoustic moments. I'm sorry that Anderson and Martin Barre are in the midst of a tiff. So, Barre is not on this album, which is a shame because he is a masterful, lead guitar player. However, the young and equally amazing Florian Opahle steps in and fills Barre's shoes admirably. The rest of the band is stellar as well: John O'Hara (hammond organ, piano, keyboards), David Goodier (bass guitar, glockenspiel), Scott Hammond (drums, percussion). There are beautiful sonic touches from other players including Peter Judge who contributes trumpet, flugelhorn, tenor horn and E-flat tuba. Anderson's voice is in fine form here, which is great to hear, as he has famously struggled with vocal difficulties since the recording of Underwraps in the mid-80s. Sure he's no Pavarotti, and has always had a very limited vocal range, but the voice is as comfortable as your favourite slippers. And as much as I generally dislike spoken word parts on rock albums, the few times Anderson does that to share the narrative, it works marvelously well.<br /><br />The telling of Bostock's march from adolescence into adulthood presents various possible scenarios (\\"what ifs, maybes and might have beens\\"): Gerald as banker, crooked evangelist, military man, shopkeeper, homeless and destitute etc. Musically and lyrically it's all very entertaining and brilliantly performed. The music occasionally reprises bits from the original Thick As A Brick and there are references to other great Tull albums too if you listen carefully for them. While we have some instrumental and vocal parts from the previous album, it's a new and entirely engrossing album on offer. The sound is tremendous throughout this disc, thanks to Anderson's considerable skills as a producer. But let's also give credit where credit is due to Steven Wilson -- of Porcupine Tree fame -- for his important contribution as mixing engineer. The flute parts sound incredible, particularly when cranked on a great stereo system. There is wonderful dynamic range across the sound palette in this beautiful mix. The drum sound is crisp and powerful; the electric guitar work of Ophale cuts through it all with searing greatness. The bass sounds rich and full and in fact the rhythm section is tight and powerful from start to finish. The quiet moments with piano, acoustic guitar or horns are really gorgeous. The test of an album that succeeds for me is do I want to hear it again after I've listened once through. I find myself putting Thick As A Brick 2 on repeat, so it's a smashing success in my books. It seems most folks on Amazon agree with me as to the quality of this album, with 4 stars the average rating. For those who are slagging it -- and pretending to be Jethro Tull fans in the process -- I suspect you never were a true fan of this music to begin with. If you really love Jethro Tull, this album will be your thing. As for those who don't, go back to your Coldplay records and swoonover Chris Martin.
B006NYQAJM|5.0|This is a great addition to the DC Super Hero sets. Included is a blue Batman, red Robin, the Joker, his main squeeze Harley, and the Riddler for good measure. The play features are abundant in this set. The figures look amazing for sure.<br /><br />It is exclusive to Toys 'r Us or Lego Shop @ Home, so if you are finding it here, it is probably way overpriced. If you can find it for the right price, I would highly recommend picking it up.
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|This is a well presented treatise on atheism, but there is nothing new here.<br /><br />As an evangelical Christian I am always interested in reading anti-religious rhetoric, and Dawkins has done a good job at stating all of the timeworn atheistic arguments in \\"The God Delusion.\\" No new concepts are presented, but the material is well assembled and logically articulated.  If you want to understand the atheist point of view in a nutshell, this is the book for you.<br /><br />The book might be thought-provoking for the agnostic college freshman or  the Bible-illiterate nominal Christian, but more critical thinkers have heard this all before: Human belief in various gods throughout history is an attempt by humans to comprehend the complexity of nature, but is ultimately rooted in ignorance and superstition; Darwin and his theory of natural selection make unnecessary the belief in an intelligent designer to explain intricate design found in nature; most scientists are atheists or agnostics (so since they're smarter than we are, there can't be a God); and the granddaddy of them all - religion and its accompanying intolerance is responsible for more evil throughout history than good, so wouldn't we all be better off without it?<br /><br />Paul may well have encountered some of these same arguments; he tells us that when he preached the gospel some were offended and others said it was all nonsense (1 Cor. 1:23). None of this should surprise Christians. Attempts by human reasoning throughout history to disprove the existence of God are to be expected. Our natural human minds are hostile to God (Romans 8:7).<br /><br />Other atheists have equivocated on certain points in the God-debate by at least acknowledging that some good has come from religion (hospitals, orphanages, etc). But Dawkins doesn't pull any punches in this zealously anti-religion diatribe. He is honest and straightforward in his hatred for God and admits that although he rejects all religions, the primary target of this book is Christianity. His contempt for the God of the Bible is clearly stated throughout.<br /><br />More than simply not believing in God, he clearly despises God. But like other truly brilliant atheists, one cannot help but notice a lack of humility in Dawkins' argument. The book drips with smug self-importance, which is a necessary character trait for those who hate God.  He even gives his own list of \\"New 10 Commandments\\" (how modest) including such secular humanist classics such as, \\"Do not indoctrinate your children. Teach them how to think for themselves, how to evaluate evidence, and how to disagree with you.\\"  Gee, where have we heard that one before? \\"Make your own decisions; decide what is good or evil for yourself.\\"  Dawkins may be interested to learn that that little piece of bad advice goes back quite a bit before he thought to include it here. It was one of Satan's first recorded lies, said to Eve in the Garden of Eden (\\"You shall be as gods, knowing good and evil\\").<br /><br />My main problem with this book is that I was hoping for something new or at least thought provoking. Instead we find a well presented, but played-out recitation of the same old atheist dogma we've heard for years.<br /><br />On the technical side, there is some laziness in Dawkins' research, most evident in the section on biblical errors and inconsistencies. The tired list of alleged contradictions presented here (e.g. the birthplace and genealogy of Jesus) have all been previously explained by numerous Bible scholars and apologists (a good source on this topic is Norman L. Geisler's \\"Big Book of Bible Difficulties.\\")<br /><br />A warning to my fellow Christians - be prepared to be deeply offended by Dawkins loathsome remarks about God. I'm sure that his intention was to be as \\"in your face\\" as possible, and he certainly succeeds in the eloquence of his blasphemy.<br /><br />In short, this is a well written and well organized summary of atheist creed but nothing wehaven't heard before.  If you've never taken the time to learn the basic tenets of atheism this will be a useful primer, but if you've been interested in the debate for a while there will be no surprises here.

0449806979|4.0|I am pregnant with my first and reading all I can get my hands on. I'll admit flipping through it and reading the snippet about sleeping through at 2 months. And I was a sucker born and with happy hubris handed over my cash ready to get home prepared to raise a child who will sleep.<br /><br />This book gave me the vocabulary to explain to my husband what I loved so much about being my parents' child. My parents raised me the 'french' way with my two older brothers. They were very strict on the things that mattered, extremely flexible on the rest. It made for a very happy, balanced house.<br /><br />This book is not perfect, far from it. But I've been reading a LOT of baby books right now and so many of them tell you what to do in a way that feels to me like it is bred to fill mothers-to-be with fear and anxiety or to hit new mother's with a full tank of guilt. What? I don't have WWII original black out curtains in the nursery and instead mine have ducks? I am a terrible mother who if I only had those curtains would have raised the next Einstein. Alas, without those curtains he will grow to be Carrot Top. The humanity!<br /><br />I like this book because it was so calm and let me see how you can still make mistakes but still raise a healthy, happy well adjusted child. I feel less stressed and feel safer in trusting my own instincts. Now I just need to learn 'the look' my parents knew so well...

Even the behind the scene in the extra is filmed in 3D. Throughout the concert, you are in the audience with hands standing all around you. The band knows where the cameras are and they are doing everything to take advantage of it.<br />The menu is beautiful, the song selection is amazing. The DTS-HD audio is as usual with Scorpions, crispy clean and very well adjusted to hear all the instruments equally and Klaus' voice perfectly.<br />Thank you Scorpions.

B002KT3XH6|5.0|I love Alison Weir's Tudor books. I am about to finish my second history degree and love to read Weir's book as a break from the stuffy textbooks I sometime have to read. Her style of writing brings the characters life for me. But as a history major I know that a great deal of weir's book is conjecture. That's not to say its wrong. In fact I am extremely impressed with the amount of research that has gone into this book. But history to some extent is a guessing game. Yes we know the dates and events that took place but those are just the bare bones of the skeleton of the past. To add meat to the bones so to speak requires some educated guesses about the motives, thoughts, and feelings of those involved. This is what Ms. Weir does quite extensively in this book. She uses her historical research to make educated guesses as to the thoughts and feelings of those in the Tudor court and I personally don't begrudge her for it as most of her conclusions are historically sound. Also I have noticed some reviewers commenting on the amount of detail and time spent on Henry's first two wives in comparison to the latter three. This is due to the wealth of historical data about Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn that still exists. Sadly there is surprisingly little information on his other wives. This of course is no fault of the writer and considering this I believe she did a commendable job. Over all I think this book is a must read for anyone interested in Tudor or British history.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|An honest film about the weaving of a \\"love story,\\" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind uses the plot device of memory-erasing technology to wonder whether one can ever truly sever from another. It has a brand of humorous dark whimsy that is near impossible to match in tone. And the only weakness, as a member of the speculative genre, stems from its glossing over of malformed memories. Like all good science fiction, though, the \\"science\\" is subservient to the storytelling. It contrasts to [[ASIN:B00119XQAK The Final Cut]], a relative in the sci-fi family, because Eternal Sunshine lacks the recognition of the human tendency toward idealizing and nostalgia that seems to inform the genre, and the new wave of indie romances. As usual, Charlie Kaufman rebels against nostalgia by not subjecting his characters to it, which is either deeply honest or deeply delusional, depending on your worldview.<br /><br />I have come back to this movie many times since I first saw it, and every time, it greets me with the same stark truths of evolving relationships that it did the first time. Yet, like the main characters with each other, I still feel a stranger to the it. Eternal Sunshine is remembered not as a stepping stone to a new narrative form, but as a standout even years later for its uniqueness.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|THE FOREVER GIRL by Rebecca Hamilton (@inkmuse)... Book full of easily imaginable scenes and was not able to stop myself from reading it even though my exams are going on... :)<br />What a fantabulous novel with new and amazing creatures/characters, most importantly with a superb plot/story.<br /><br />Starting was seemed a bit slow but slowly from mid chap-2 where Sophia performs her 'ritual for positive energy' the story gets you. And after few chapters it proves to be a page turner.<br /><br />CHARACTERS- the characters and the bond that they carried was nice. I liked the friendship between Adrian and Charles, how Adrian was with Charles when he needed him the most on a life threatening mission.<br />Sophia's weak bond with her problematic and god fearing mother and her hate bond with her neighbor Mrs. Franklin- a paranoid who nearly killed Sophia.<br />Sophia's little world around her two friends- Ivory whom she considered best friend is the one with biggest secret. And as for Lauren, well she is the only one who adds some normalcy to her abnormal life.<br />Love bond between Sophia and Charles, which starts with Sophia's distrust towards her new -attractively handsome- love interest...<br />You'll love them... :)<br /><br />STORY- Is about a 'simple' girl who is on a mission to find a better job and get rid of the voices in her head. Her life was already difficult with a problematic mother and a psycho neighbor Mrs. Franklin, but more life threatening difficulties awaits her.<br />Hoping to meet Adrian who she thought can help her to get rid of the voices, went to Club Flesh with Ivory. This single vist to a 'dancing' club was her biggest mistake. Even though she found her Love Charles there, a new world with dangerous creatures found her, turning her world upside down increasing her life's difficulty level.<br />As the story proceeds curtain of unidentified dark world and truth about her friends, ancestors and the voices starts to unveil in front of her.<br /><br />How will she react to the facts? Will she be able to accept the new found powers and dark world? Or will she run away from it? How will she face the dark forces which are after her life?<br /><br />Sophia's journey is interesting to follow consisting all the romance, drama, suspense... and much more. It's not only Vampires and shape-shifters but also witches (it's first time that I got to read about witches in a novel). It's a world Rebecca created consisting of five elementals- air, water, earth (Vampires), fire and spirit (witches)<br /><br />WRITING- the flow the story is lyrical and descriptive. Rebecca wrote it so nicely that it felt as it I was a part of Sophia's journey, like everything happened in front of my eyes. I could imagine most of the scenes.<br /><br />I liked it a lot. Proof I was so much engrossed in reading it that I skipped my full night sleep to finish it. It was like a 'Super Glue' which kept my eyes and my whole attention fasten to the events in the book till I read the last word. Even after closing it my heart is still struck around Sophia's world asking to know more about her... how she handles her newly found powers, her life with Charles and with the two little guests in a new place away from world around them? And some questions revolving around the Queen?<br /><br />I would recommend Forever Girl who loves to read paranormal, supernatural fantasy filled with romance & suspense and History. Yes, it contains a part of history surrounding the 1690's Salem Witch Trials. Don't worry you won't find even a bit of it off track in fact it takes the story towards the 'Real' part... :)<br /><br />Thanks Rebecca for this wonderful new world. :)<br />-Anubha (@miliminni)<br /><br />*guys i am sorry if u find this review unsatisfying, i tried my best to express myself, its my first review, i am a first timer here<br />How will she react to the facts?

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I have been listening to the album for well over a month now and I have come to appreciate quite a few things about it.  I like the way that I hear his many musical explorations melded.  I hear the anthemic qualities of arena-rock, the spiritual chorales of Motown by way of R&B, and the raucousness of celtic-inspired folk that came with our Welsh, Scottish and Irish ancestors and traveled down south and out west.  It seems to me that the sound is uniquely American.  And this album is all-about sound and far less about lyrics than past efforts.<br /><br />I know that some reviewers have felt that he has turned his back on telling small stories from the perspectives of individual narrators and I admit, that mid-way through my listening experience I missed the Highway Patrolman perspective because, after all, Bruce is one hell of a storyteller when he puts his mind to it.  But I revisted some of his own words about his feelings writing the songs and I can see that he has tried, in the best tradition of rock and roll protest songs, to use the music to give us his dream of America in the richness of its musical traditions, while letting the words be a simpler form of angry protest.  As always with Bruce, it isn't the lyrics that carry the \\"dream/hope\\", its the sound.  I have seen some reviewers comment that the sound is over-produced but I find it richly layered.  On Rocky Ground, you might mistake the opening background wail of \\"I'm a soldier\\" to be Bruce.  It isn't.  It is a clip from a 1942 recording of \\"I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord\\", a traditional gospel song performed by Congregation of the Church of God in Christ.<br /><br />I think he wants us to hear all the many threads that make us America.  There isn't much of a love song on this album (except the sweetness and sorrow on Jack of All Trades of man struggling to fulfill his very masculine responsibilities).  Its the music that is the love song.  Its a fitting album for a man at this point in his life toexplore each and every American sound that made him and us.<br /><br />I would only add that many of the one-star reviewers seem overly concerned about Bruce's politics.  Rock and roll has, always, been about rebellion and protest against the conditions of our world.  It seems a bit humorous to imagine an Amazon board in 1969 with a bunch of old folks posting their disgust with John Fogerty's Fortunate Son.  Anybody remember the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame performance with Bruce and Fogerty ripping that song up?  Awesome stuff.  Those weren't small story lyrics, most of America didn't see the need for the song, and I don't recall anyone asking Fogerty about his military service as validation for his choice of singing material--although I wasn't very old at the time so maybe I missed it.  I am pretty sure that many people thought he was a dirty hippie.  Good for you John Fogerty and good for you, Bruce that you are still taking us on the journey.  I am glad to be along for the ride.  Great album.  The sounds are still on reverb in my head.

The Capitol is all about control and The Hunger Games cause Katniss to spark hope that is quickly Catching Fire within the battered districts.  However, like their genetically engineered Mockingjay; the Capitol attempts to unsuccessfully use Katniss.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|This is really expensive considering what it is! But definately works better than others that I've tried.  Would I buy it again? Yes
B000MAOLVW|5.0|The all time greatest racing film, and a terrific throwback to the mid sixties formula one scene.  Most of the footage takes place at some of the most iconic racetracks in history, at a time before run off areas and seating sections located half way between the race course and the nearest town.  Even the billboards are fun to look at!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I absolutely love this game! ive been looking for a Mario game forever! was even considering buying a gameboy Color but not anymore! :-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My book club almost didn't read this book because they said I wouldn't approve - they were shocked when they found out I was on book No. 2
B004P2CQM4|3.0|The ordered Air Swimmer (Clown Fish) was delivered within the related time frame.<br /><br />All aspects of the Air Swimmer were as stated.<br /><br />Was shipped to a relative. The relative related \\"it's fun\\"...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I fell victim to the hype.  This whole trilogy is so desperately brainless.  It's poorly written, repetitive, and full of typos (Oh My!).  Ana is a pathetic and completely unbelievable heroine and Christian is a total wimp.<br />Unfortunately, I actually paid for and read all three books because I hate giving up when I start something, but also because there were such rave reviews.  I figured that I must be missing something if so many people liked these books so much...  My mistake.  The books just got more repetitive and consequently, more irritating.  Luckily they were short and simple, so I didn't throw away too much of my valuable reading time.<br />To those who would like to read a book of this genre, but are seriously irritated by bad writing and bad editing, I suggest visiting some old Anne Rice books written under the pseudonym A.N. Rouquelaure.  See [[ASIN:0452281423 The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]].
0545265355|4.0|What I l of liked best about this trilogy is, simply put, the Katniss character and the character of Katniss. She has such noble intentions, from providing for her family starting at age 11 when her dad died and her mother could not cope. And the love she has for Prim, how she volunteered as tribute for her little sister, even when this is not the norm in the Games. And, of course, I admire her hunting skills, and it was especially nice that (and I don't want to give too much away) that she took mostly a strategy of defense in the games, only killing directly when she absolutely has to. I give the trilogy 4 stars simply because the 3rd in the series, \\"Mockingjay\\", doesn't quite match the quality of the first two in the series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|By now, you have all read what this book is about. I want to tell you how it makes you feel. I kept putting myself into the story and was always asking myself \\"what would I do\\". the question arises in your mind when is defending Jacob too much and when does the harsh reality set in. I ,for one, couldn't answer that because I have never been in that situation but even trying to surmise what I would do it really became an internal struggle of what is a good parent.<br /><br />This is a fascinating legal thriller that is very readable, interesting characters surrounded by a family drama that makes you question yourself and what you would do. Would recommend this book highly.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I started this series thinking that I was going to read a story about interesting and engaging characters with some drama about personal conflicts and business suspense. Imagine my surprise when I realized that it was really a primer on sex!! I love the cleverness of the author and the way she sees through characters and expresses their frailites. But I also think she takes the chicken way out when things get too dramatic and stressful. Such as Ana's run in with Leila, the whole kidnapping, etc. I expected to be kept on the edge on my seat much longer. By the last book I was skimming through the 30-40 page descriptions on their sexual adventures, because, frankly, I was tired of it. But I wanted to see if anything really dramatic ever really happened. Like, for instance, would they still love eachother so much if one of them had a terrible accident and was not so \\"hot\\"? Honestly, is there any man anywhere who is that good and unselfish at teaching sexual lessons? Seriously? This may be every woman's dream, but so completely unreal!!! I hope this author writes something else and takes the literary business more seriously.
B003Y5H556|4.0|I just wanted to help boost the ratings of the movie by voting favorably for it. I liked it. If you can get it on sale, get it.
B000I9YV30|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old and can honestly say, 8 years later, it still holds a special place in my heart. Unlike many movies that are made these days, Stand By Me has exceptional acting and a simple story, set to a beautiful period in time(the 50's). The talent of the young up and coming actors (River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, et al)  will blow you away and to this day I can still sit and watch this movie over and over. Why? because it is a TIMELESS piece that will never loose its relevancy. I recommend this movie to any and every one.  It is definitely a film you should see at least once in your life time (though I guarantee you'll want to see it more often!!) To those of you who haven't seen the film, buy it! And to those that have seen it, watch it again!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was excellently written!  A real cliff-hanger!  I can't wait to read the next book. They should make a movie about this- the whole series!
0307593312|5.0|This novel has all the twists and turns of other Murakami works, and plenty of intriguing science fiction, but at its heart is a romantic love story. And two lonely children, slaves to their parents, who connect and then are separated until many years later their stories twine back together. There are many story lines twisting together like vines in a jungle, all intriguing, some mystifying, even frustrating, and even at the end of the book you look back and there are still mysteries - so I wanted to start reading it again right away - which to me is the sign of a five-star book. Besides the love story, the parent-child relationships in the book are also very moving - Tengo caring for his dying father, Aomame and the aging dowager. At times the book felt like D.H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers. I also loved the descriptions of Tokyo in 1984, similar and yet very different from the U.S. in 1984, and from Orwell's book. While I am not a science fiction fan, I kept turning the pages of this book to see what happened next, and enjoyed every word.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Im 24% into the book according to my Kindle Fire and so far, so good. It is an easy read and I really enjoy how the author was given free reign to tell all sides of Jobs, not just the good. Very educational and a great story indeed about the computer revolution!
B0055SWM08|5.0|How nice to play a challenging game that avoids candy colors and annoying cartoon noises.  Nostalgia is an odd choice for the context of this game but it really does add to the overall experience.
B006OB3K56|4.0|\\"We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place.\\" Brandon (Fassbender) is a very private person. He does his job well and takes the subway to and from work. He doesn't have many close friends, but that fits his life style. Brandon is an extreme sex addict. He lives his life how he wants until his sister Sissy (Mulligan) shows up unannounced. He does his best to hide his addiction from her, but somethings aren't that easy. First of all I have to say that this is a really good movie. That said it's not easy to watch. Fassbender is amazing in this and I have no idea why he didn't get nominated. I'm guessing because the movie is NC-17 and there is a lot of sex and nudity. That aside watching him struggle with his addiction with few words is really mesmerizing. I can compare this to \\"Drive\\" in the style and the pacing, few words but powerful actions. Brandon is one of the most unlikeable characters I have seen lately but the entire time you really want him to change and you end up sympathizing and identifying with Sissy through out most of the movie. Movies that polarize you like that are an adventure to watch and you seem to get more out of it. All that said I do recommend this. Overall, A great but hard movie to watch, very emotional. I give it an A-.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is just like the older Mario game! it is a little too simple but it is relaxing. hope they update it more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|action for your fingers And a challenge for your mind this is also a good mind game ad well to challenge the brain
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a great way to waste time as long as you are alternating it with other games that require time for your energy to build up again. They should consider adding mini games to help build up energy faster.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|The Editorial Review that Amazon chose to post with this item should be totally ignored.<br /><br />Yes, I am sure that Act of Valor does not meet the standards set by whatever college film class Fetzer attended.  However, if you want to watch a movie that shows a fantastic example of the code that American warriors live by, then Act of Valor is a must see.  Fetzer is correct on one point; the film does set up a dynamic of absolute moral clarity:  Evil terrorists and drug dealers versus heroic members of the US military - just like in real life.  I am sure many can understand how that accurate a portrayal makes Hollywood and their followers very nervous.<br /><br />If you want a taste of what the US military does to keep this country safe then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Act of Valor is one of the best movies ever made!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I truly enjoy this game!! the only hint that is annoying is that when you try and get free point by downloading other games and play.... the points they promise you never show up!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is horrible, I downloaded 12 videos to watch on a road trip, and out of all, I was only able to watch 1. all the other ones would stop in the middle, saying that it was interrupted or is an unsupported format. doesn't work

B00000K2VZ|4.0|This was Janis Joplin's best album. It's a shame she couldn't overcome whatever it was that drove her to find answers in the pages of a blank book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is really fun for those who like the Mario games they have for the D.S  Plus it's a great  way to pass the time.
0817439390|4.0|Bryan captures the essence of a good exposure.  He expanded my knowledge of what a good exposure is and how to capture the best exposure possible each time I press the shutter release.  Moving from a solid definition of what comprises the best exposure for the subject, Bryan walks through the elements of capturing the exposure: aperture, shutter speed and light.  And, he brings light to the gray card 18% solution of the camera's light meter!  It's a great read with beautiful photographs gracing every page!
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game but would like ability to rotate.<br />Also new to this type of game and would have liked more info about setting up routes for trucks but eventually figured it out.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Amazingly fun game!!!!!<br /> One of my most played games ever!!!!!!!!<br />Never gonna delete it!!!!!<br />I HOPE MORE LEVELS COME SOONER!!!!!!!!
B006JD48NM|5.0|This is a well done film, but the real genius is Senna. You will be moved by his skill, confidence, and humility. But beware; you will be emotionally wrecked by the politics of the FIA and the tragedy of Ayrton's death.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|It is nice for an old man with just basic computer skills to find out how much fun he can have with a bunch of birds and a slingshot. But it does come with a STEEP learning curve, how steep to fire them and what Bird does what. I just wish they had a \\"slide show\\" or \\"Directory\\" that had some hints as to what to do. But I can say it has been \\"A heck of a ride\\".

0767020308|5.0|Kate Beckinsale fits the role well age-wise and gives, in mho, the best telling (of any of the film Emmas) of a girl who does just does not see her own arrogance, or her lack of true understanding. She is paired with Mark Strong, who gives us a Mr. Knightly who looks and sounds like the ideal English country gentleman; decisive, successful, generous and competent. The film, while not as lushly photographed as Gwyneth's nor as  detailed as Romola's, gives us a very well crafted telling with some touches others missed. For example this film does a wonderful job of showing the gulf between the upper class, and the servant and worker classes. The picnic at Box Hill and the Strawberry picking at Donwell Abbey are wonderful examples. The whole cast is very competent, particularly Raymond Coulthard as the best of all Frank Churchill's and Samantha Morton as a very pretty and personable Harriet Smith. Bernard Hepton is lovable as Mr. Woodhouse but borders a bit on silly.<br /><br />All the filmed Emma's have their strengths. For the lovers of the story, Kate, in this shorter version, gives us a great, young Emma we first dislike, then love: just as Jane intended.
0345803485|5.0|I just want to start by saying thank you to E.L. James for giving me a book I could fall in love with.  This book is written in a way that captivated me from the start - I honestly felt like I could be Ana.  This book (written from Ana's perspective) is very, very real.  While some of the scenes in the book could be considered \\"crude\\" and \\"unnecessarily graphic\\", I think it was refreshing to have such an honest, open, realistic description.  It seems like real life, and I love that James doesn't shy away from all the details.  This book is so much more than a \\"pornographic novel\\" or \\"erotica\\"; it is such a beautiful love story about two people not entirely understanding what they feel and learning to discover it together.<br /><br />Although Christian was kind of \\"strange\\", I found (like Ana) that nothing he did really made me disgusted with him.  He was so endearing and easy to fall in love with.  I found myself thinking, \\"Where's my Christian?  I want one.\\"  He definitely is fifty shades, but honestly, who isn't?  His character was so honest and raw, which was such a breath of fresh air from other male characters in romantic books.  He's not perfect, sometimes he says the wrong things, and he messes up.  A lot.  He is so unpredictable and \\"mercurial\\", it sometimes became frustrating but, to be honest, it's one of the reasons I started and finished the book in one day.  I needed to know what would happen next.<br /><br />Anastasia (\\"Ana\\") was also a very endearing character.  She was very innocent and sweet throughout the entirety of the book, despite certain events that occurred.  I loved the internal narration, the descriptions of her bickering \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\", and her innocent \\"oh crap\\" and \\"holy cow\\" expressions.  I am not all that different from Ana, and it is nice to have a character that is so like me.<br /><br />This book is extremely well-written and is one many, many women can relate to - even if we don't like to admit it.  It is fun, heartwarming, heartbreaking, and simply wonderful.  In fact, I think I'll read it again.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The newest version of the Yahoo! Mail app addressed all the complaints I had previously. The app looks good, and navigation is very easy.  I'm not a huge fan of so much purple but other than that I have no complaints.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Let me start by saying; This is the first time I have ever reviewed anything online.  I have fallen in love with this album over the last year. So much so, it compelled me to write my first review.<br /><br />While many of the tracks can hold their own, I believe the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. This is an album meant to be heard from start to finish. The intro sets the appropriate tone for the album's entirety. Taking you on a journey which gets better every time you hear it.  It's mesmerizing melodies tell the take of a full cycle of love.  Infatuation, lust, love, dispair, and rediscovery, narrated by two haunting voices that balance one another perfectly.<br /><br />While the musicianship isn't enough to carry it alone, the composure is nothing short of genius.  This is a perfect example of musical minimalism.  The absences of notes makes the seemingly simplistic melodies keep your interest throughout.  The songwriting is sheer poetry.  Not a word's meaning is wasted or lost.  This is a piece of artistry which is meant to be heard.  This is something you can put on in the background, or personally experience through headphones, absorbing every last word and note.  Their next release can't come soon enough.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This is great R&B R&R. Great to listen to while in the car all day, makes me focus less on the fools out there pretending to drive and more on listening to a really great band. Drummer is devine. Better than El Camino IMHO.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great game. This game just takes you away from everything. Great app! I would recommend this game to people who need a moment to themselves.
B005URRCUY|5.0|A few really good tracks but not enough to recommend, tho music is very subjective.  A little disappointed but love the Black Keys. Drummer is brilliant !
0439023521|5.0|This book had me from the first page. I haven't read something this enjoyable and all consuming in quite a long time. I don't know why it is being touted as \\"a book for young readers\\" because I'm 56 years old and usually read a book a week and this book had it all! I kept putting it down because I didn't want it to end. The best part of it is that this is book one of a trilogy and I hope the other 2 books are as good as this one.
B004XJHBCE|4.0|Would be nice if the icons for the labels would show up as large as the rest of the shortcuts on my Kindle Fire. Other than that, the app is great. For those who gave it one star that owns a Kindle Fire, you have to install Go Launcher EX ( you can side-load this without rooting) in order to use an app like this. Don't blame this developer for the limitations of the stock Amazon Launcher.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game on the Kindle Fire. Good game play and graphics with skippable ads between games. Has auto complete feature and you can just tap cards to auto move them.
B003INBOE2|5.0|This is such a good movie. I have never seen a better Kun Fu movie in all my life. It is probably the best fighting movie I have ever see. Fantastic.
1401227821|5.0|Finally, a book from one of the greatest comic illustrators of recent times. The book is beautifully made and well representative of Hughes' work. Hopefully, a companion book of his black and white/greytone work will come out sometime soon. Well worth the modest cost, I'd recommend this volume to anyone who appreciates great art featuring hot ladies and unique comic style. (was that OK, Mr. Hughes? When will I get my $10? It's in the mail? Thank you, sir.)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its an awesome game its basically like Mario that is why I like it. it is a very entertaining game I can play this game for ever
B005SJIP2S|4.0|in reading the other reviews on this c.d. i cannot believe no-one mentioned that after 30 years we have a LIVE version of machine messiah that is note for note like listening to the studio DRAMA version. jon anderson had some bug up his butt where he would not sing anything from the DRAMA album ever; all we ever got were parts of TEMPEST FUGET during parts of the fish between alan white and chris squire. all of you yes fans out there ;like myself should be standing up and cheering. i loved DRAMA and i still think it is one of the best YES albums besides CLOSE TO THE EDGE that they ever recorded. i wish that they would do a 30 year anniversary tour where they would do DRAMA in its entirety.
B005M68S4W|5.0|Tony Bennett still has it! He can sing across many different types af music and blend with many different  types of voices. I highly recommend this album.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Glitchy app.  Unresponsive interface. Crashed my kindle. Could have been fun but was too frustrating to use.  Don't waste your time.
1451673442|5.0|Amazing book, its a must have, must read. It just changed my life and changed the way I think. Thank you Rhonda Byrne for such an amazing book!
0066620996|5.0|This book is a must read for Leaders.  Not just for the business study.  This is a life changing book that can be applied to life in general.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I downloaded this one after it came recommended by some fans on Shelley Crane's facebook page (if you haven't checked her out yet, you definitely should). It is PHENOMONAL! I loved every moment of the book. Lake just can't seem to get a break in life, and neither can Will. One unexpected turn of events happens after another and you just know that their kind of love is the kind really worth fighting for, and boy does life make them fight for it.<br /><br />I really loved that not only do you fall in love with the two main characters, but Colleen Hoover gets you to fall in love with all of her minor characters as well (from Caulder and Kel, to Lake's mom, Lake's best friend Eddie, Eddie's boyfriend Gavin, and even Eddie's foster dad Joel who's only in one heartbreakingly beautiful scene). These characters all have something to teach us about life and living with the hand you've been dealt. I laughed, I cried, and I feel in love.<br /><br />I really fell in love with the book through the slam poetry sessions. Those poems were so powerful, so full of emotion; it made me start searching for where I can go to a slam near me. I had been to some in college, but hadn't been back since. It was a great reminder of what I'm missing, that all of us have stories to share and words is one of the most powerful tools we have.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it was fun and i play it over and over! it downloaded fast and it was the best game i have played in a while
B005804N4Q|5.0|This is what high-rez surround sound is all about.  Truly wonderful sound in every way, just like the GAUCHO sacd is -  Awesome!!!<br /><br />Now where the rest of your collection Donald?!?  How about Katy Lied, Can't Buy a Thrill, Decade of, etc... sure would be nice to hear in this format.
B001G0MFOM|4.0|I really want to give this maybe even 3 stars, but I really love this show and I know a lot of people might think my rating is for the whole series, but this is just for the FINAL SEASON.<br /><br />There were so many things left unanswered. It felt rushed, there weren't even enough episodes for the last season. IT IS THE FINAL SEASON!!! And it has less episodes than even last season? What is this? The L Word is one of the best shows I have ever seen in my entire life, and midway it felt rushed. Even after new problems arose, they were never answered. Just nothing. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I just want to say I can't believe (POSSIBLE SPOILER ON DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTER) how I hated Jenny's guts by the end of this series. I really liked Jenny until about Season 5 where she became snobby and then she kept ruining everybody's lives and in everyone's business. Even making Shane crazy who is her best friend and the most relaxed character.<br /><br />And I must say, Bette Porter is the best character in this whole series. They are all wonderful characters, they are all well rounded, but even though I felt like Bette Porter or even Shane should have been the face of the L word, the whole ending ended up being all about Jenny. And in a VERY bad way.<br /><br />As for the WHOLE SERIES, I just loved this show. Their friendship was so real, they did everything together and had each others backs. They went to every event together, talked about everything. If I were to ever have a big circle of friends, I'd love to have a group as great as they were. No TV show has had this type of friendship, and between women. Actually the drama was just about right between all the women, because it's true LOL!<br /><br />I must say, the sex scenes were basically like soft core, and you saw ever character naked, and you got so use to them being naked that it was no big deal. EVERYTHING showed. It actually got annoying for me, they would sleep with each other so fast LOL.<br /><br/>It just sucks there will never be another show like this. It was also pulled prematurely.<br /><br />My PET PEEVE about this show however is the infidelity. Even the character's you didn't think would cheat, they do. Even your favorite ones!<br /><br />The best seasons were probably season 2-4. I have SO much to say, but I really don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />But if you want to see a show where there's a lots of lesbian drama, lots of sex, lots of great friendship between a circle of friends where you won't see on another show ever, watch this. I felt like I was apart of their little circle... this is the type of show where if you don't feel comfortable with yourself and you want to be alone and watch a show, you can watch this (if you're gay and in self denial). Anybody can see this show... just don't watch it with kids or your mom, or even grandma!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Every single God dam day it wont load my Timeline or my mentions. Other than that there's no problems but that's a pretty big issue. y'all need to fix that
B0052VUNHC|5.0|words cannot describe the love i have for this book. travis and abby are the most awkward, cutest, most wonderful thing since sliced bread that i have ever read about. i haven't even finished the book yet, but i don't want it to end. it feels like a never ending movie. screw all you stuck up people who feel this book shouldn't be shared with the world. it shows the true horrors of a relationship, but also the true romance shared between two people destined to be together. if you don't like it, then why the heck did you care to finish the book?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While the first book grabbed my attention, it just became a monotonous sexual escapade with orgasm after orgasm with no plot whatsoever. Even the orgasms became redundant, \\"Oh Anna!, Oh God!, Oh Christian\\". I bought the second book in the series, hoping that it would get better, and it only got worse. I won't be purchasing the third. If I fall asleep while reading a book, its not a good one.<br />Huge let down. Sorry I spent the money.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|This was a very good movie.  It's funny in parts but has lots of drama as well.  If you read the book, you will like it, it follows the story pretty well.  But, it's a good movie to just watch even if you have not read the book.

0345457692|4.0|Richard K. Morgan is known for his interesting ideas and creative style of writing. In this science-fiction piece in particular he paints a noir like future in a world where man has colonized other worlds and immortality can be attained. Morgan allows us to experience this world through the eyes of Takeshi Kovacs, an ex-ENVOY corps and former gang member. Kovacs is reserved, intelligent and human. He plays along with high-society but also dips into the lower rungs and he certainly is not afraid to use force. There is a variety of strong characters in the novel from Miriam Bancroft to Kristin Ortega.  Morgan sculpts a breath-taking and bleak futuristic world where religion is declining and the inhabitants are offered unlimited life whilst crafting a complex yet understandable plot that will leave you wondering if this future truly is good or bad.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love this game. it is so much fun.  i don't know what i would do with out it. so what if there is ads that doesn't take  the fun  out of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a decent app for passing the time. controls on some mini games need some tuning. having to unlock each new game I think adds to the playability. overall, pretty well done game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|If you like puzzles I think you'll like this game. It's a series of mazes that become progressively harder to navigate as you try to get to specific objects. I'm already addicted! I'm working to get perfect scores. See if you can! Avoid the spikes and pointed objects! They're killers! My previous review had a few oopses.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I finished the first book in 2 days, the second book in one day. And this one, the third book, It took me more than a week and I still dragged my feet reading it. Somehow it's just all the characters' whining, no thrilling stories happen.
B000O14VAU|5.0|Great plot, characters, special effects, weapons, action.  Very addictive movie that you can watch repeatedly.  Found myself siding with the lycans (werewolves).  I didn't like how fast the vampires adapted their technology after learning from the werewolves.  Outstanding series, too.  Watch the other movies, too.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|If you are looking for a great action adventure, look no further.  JOHN CARTER is a classic scifi tale based on a series of novels penned by Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan, about 100 years ago.  These stories were the source material that inspired George Lucas' STAR WARS saga, the Superman comicbooks, James Cameron's AVATAR, and the Flash Gordan and Buck Rogers characters among many many others. Blending action, humor, romance and drama with some of the best CGI special effects since AVATAR, JOHN CARTER will not disappoint.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch does a great job in the title role, and Lynn Collins as the princess Dejah Thoris is absolute perfection.  The CGI Martian 'dog' Woola is a show stealer with his comical and endearing antics, and the green four-armed Tharks Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and Sola (Samantha Morton)are amazingly brought to life onscreen.  Mark Strong as the Thern Matai Shang and Dominic West as Sab Than make great villians in this story, and James Purefoy's wonderful portrayal of Kantos Kan in a supporting role is so good he simply doesn't get enough screen time to do him justice.<br /><br />Epic battle scenes, plenty of action and light humor throughout, heroism, and many moments of high emotion and drama -- it is all here!  Many professional film critics just got this one wrong, it definitely is NOT A FLOP in terms of quality film making; Director Andrew Stanton and Co. have everything to be proud of here.  This movie is rollicking fun and the most satisfying film I have seen so far this year.  You will find your appreciation for this movie grows with each time you see it (I have seen it multiple times in the theatres) and you will constantly note things you missed in previous viewings, it is that rich in detail.  Honestly, I rank this up there along with the original STAR WARS and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies for pure entertainment value.  *****5 STARS from me, well worth your time and money!
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Hilarious.  Well acted.  Compelling.  Creative.  Entertaining.  Any zombie genre fan will LOVE this film!  Professional and put the actors on the map.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun Fun!! This game will definitely remind you of a past game featuring an Italian plumber back in 90's.  This game will surely keep you and your kids entertained for hours.
B0037DGH4A|5.0|I love the whole album.  I think it one of the greatest mixture of artists that Santana has pulled together.  There is not a one that I don't like.  I also own this title on DVD.  Great concert as well.
B007CKB2AS|5.0|I'm a huge Wild and the Innocent... fan and I felt, that though early, that the freshness and the edginess would never be duplicated. I was wrong this surpasses it. I feel as though Bruce has drank from the fountain of youth. Listening to this (which I can't stop doing)takes me back to the early 70's but with current issues. Incredible lyrics and full of passion. An album for the ages!
B0073XORCY|4.0|On the whole, a nice effort by Ian despite the absence of Martin Barre on guitar. At first listen, it sounded like a mixed bag, with flashes of brilliance. But it grows on you. There are some top class tracks with great flute / guitar \\"jugalbandi.\\" The initial track is musically weak though, which is what kept me from giving it 5 stars.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have to add my 2 cents to these reviews and say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Enough so that I will definitely be purchasing the 3D version of the Blue Ray. It had an intriguing plot, great chemistry between the actors and fantastic special effects. I was not familiar with the 100 year old story/book but would like to read it now that I have seen the movie. It's regrettable this movie did not fare well in the theaters because it's doubtful we'll see any of the subsequent stories brought to life on film. That's a real shame!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One of the best King's books. Who thought that Mr. King could write such a powerful love story? He made me cry!<br />George, how we danced...
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app.  You can even set it to go off.  I also like the browsing - you find stations you listened to in other  states.
0321543726|5.0|This book makes you think a whole lot more than any other beginning C++ book out there. Once you read up to about Chapter 6, try to open up another book like \\"Beginning C++ through game programming\\"--you will notice the difference in details, hell--you actually learned 75% of that book reading up to Ch. 6 Dr. Stroustrup's book! This book will help you settle into the intimidating world of C++ and feel on par with people you know who use C++. For $50, this book is a steal! Over 1200 pages! How more \\"Beginning\\" can you actually get with that many words? What is surprising is that when I got stuck on Chapter 6 and went to go write an e-mail to Bjarne Stroustrup, he actually DID reply! So here I am, actually having a one-on-one conversation with the creator of C++ at 2 in the morning, so it amazes me that he responds to many e-mails (Try it and you'll have a conversation too!)<br /><br />This book is a must-have for any beginning C++ programmer!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot. of fun I seem to keep coming back to it. you should be able to have a lot more energy while playing as well as ways to earn energy rather then waiting.
1451673442|5.0|As someone who embraced Rhonda Byrne's first two books (Secret and Power) I was happily waiting for this book and am not disappointed!  I love how it has 28 days of daily exercises to do.  I'm on day 22 today.  Sometimes I can't help but cheat a little and look ahead at what's coming up.! It embraces the same ideas as her previous books, but gives the reader tools to implement the ideas into daily life EVERY day.  Critics will scoff at it and pick it apart just like they have with The Secret, but it's not right for them to  discount a book like this that could help so many people and solve so many world problems if everyone would give it serious consideration.  I know so many people who could benefit from this that I've purchased 4 books so far...one for me to keep forever, and three to give or lend to others who are receptive and can benefit from gratitude every day.  Thank you everyone who gets this book and utilizes it as together we are making the world a better place!

B005L38QK2|4.0|Just got this mouse yesterday and this is all based on my hand size, my hands are small-average.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Very comfortable.<br />Very durable as far as I can tell.<br />You can use this mouse to its full potential, it is just going to take a while to get used to it, though if you hold it with your pointer finger on the left mouse button, your middle finger on the middle button, and your index finger on the right mouse button it becomes much easier and much more natural to push all four extra buttons on the sides (otherwise it might feel awkward and you might have to do some movement to get to the 2 on the right side.)<br />The Diablo graphic on it is superb and much better in person.<br />Each mouse buttons are easily clicked and feel nice including the middle button, which also scrolls well and is notched.<br />Mouse is not to loud I would say it is about normal maybe a bit better.<br />Slides very well on the Diablo 3 steelseries mousepad.<br />Software is easy to use, you can turn the sensitivty all the way up to 5700 dpi making you barelyhave to move your wrist to move the mouse to one place or another, though takes some getting used to, you also have the option of turning it down as far as you like.<br />Polling rate and CPI options are also there.<br />Can change the pulsation rate to whatever you like for the diablo 3 graphic, off, steady fast, even trigger for when you click, and settings in between.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />They could have made the buttons a bit better placed so you can get to them easier, but like I said, as long as you are willing to take the time to get used to it you can use all 7 buttpns to full functionality.<br />Could have been slightly cheaper.<br />Not everyone will like the ambidextrous shape. (does not bother me however)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Of course all the hype going around would normally turn me off of a book. I am not one to read Twilight, romance or general \\"chick\\" books. I stick to mystery and suspense books, but decided to check out this \\"Mommy Porn\\".  Wow! I am so glad I did.<br />I found myself laughing out loud, had tears flowing at certain points, and sometimes my overall mood depended on what happened between Christian and Ana that day.  I read the trilogy in less than five days, finding myself prying my eyes open at one in the morning because I just couldn't bear to put my Kindle down. Not sure if it \\"changes my marriage\\" like some people claim, but I learned a lot about myself and relationships in general from these books.<br />This is one of the few books that makes me sad that I reached the end and I truly miss the characters now that I'm done.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|This 405cx is a very good unit. I use it in my mountain bike, so I recomed to get the bike mounting kit if you are going to use it in a bike, it is a lot easier to see the the info that this unit gives you while riding. I had this unit for a few months, and it works great, BUT if you use it under the RAIN it WONT work, once it gets wet it will shut down....
B006FE83U4|5.0|I don't know how many copies of this movie I've owned over the years in different formats. I hadn't replaced it since VHS went the way of the dodo bird. I ordered this based on reviews of the BR version and it arrived the next day, even though I did not order next day shipping. I put it in my Blu-Ray player and intended to watch just a few minutes on my big 50 inch plasma screen - but ended up glued to the television for the entire movie. It was simply like watching a brand new movie. The images crisp and clear enough to see details I'd never picked up before, the soundtrack (which is haunting) was symphonic. I have fallen in love with this movie all over again. An absolute must-have for any Blu Ray Collection!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so much fun i really enjoy playing. haven't run in to anything i don't like about it but i guess we shall see
0446310786|5.0|I read this many times over the years and then read it to my children. I am now buying it for them to read to their children, with its classic and timeless message; a message that is just as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. I bought several copies, this one the mass market paperback. My grandkids won't have trouble seeing it, but after getting used to reading on my Kindle, I don't think my \\"old\\" eyes can read mass market paperbacks anymore! It arrived the day after I ordered it from Amazon, in brand new condition.<br /><br />A timeless story for the ages told by the brilliant Harper Lee and winner of the Pulitzer Prize.
1451627289|5.0|I have listened to hundreds of audiobooks over a period of at least a dozen years, and find that 11-22-63 is the best audiobook that I have ever heard. That's saying alot, I know, but I'm not exaggerating. The story is fascinating. The character development, including character interplay across planes of time and disparate geographical locations, is extraordinary. I have a renewed respect for Stephen King as a storyteller. While some aspects of the story are a boilerplete King (a bit quirky), the depth of the plot and the level of research, planning and editing required to polish the story to the high sheen presented, is unmatched, in my opinion.<br /><br />As for the narrator - Absolutely stellar! I was truly captivated by his range of dialects which far surpassed any other narrator that I've heard. I am a huge fan of Scott Brick, Tony Britton, George Wilson, and several others; however, Crais Wasson so accurately articulated the gender, nationality, regional dialect, degree of health, and expression of emotion of each character that the listener can get lost in the story, rather than being distracted by the lack of skill or lack of vocal range of the storyteller. Craig, you're my new number one narrator!<br /><br />My sincere thanks to Stephen King and Craig Wasson for a truly memorable experience. The past harmonizes. Of this I am certain.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Anything by SK is awesome!!  Havnt finished reading it yet but close.  Thanks for it being on kindle makes it easier to travel
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Watched this movie for the first time last night (Good Friday) with my 12 year old son.  I agree with the other reviewer in that I wouldn't allow children any younger than 12 or 13 to view this film due to it's graphic and disturbing violence.<br /><br />The movie is very, very intense - it's also very, very good.  Very sobering.  When you see a crucifix in a church or in a store, Jesus looks all perfect and peaceful hanging from it - Gibson's movie shows the reality that Jesus was beaten and whipped to a bloody pulp before being hung up on the cross, and it wasn't a pretty sight.  It makes one realize, as a Christian, what He really went through for US - and it's very humbling.<br /><br />Have a box of tissues next to you when you watch this - you'll need it.  I was still crying as the credits rolled.<br /><br />Also be aware that this movie is spoken in the Aramaic (sp?) dialect with English subtitles.  Not a problem for my son and I, and I felt that it added to the realism of the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. you can leave and comeback to where you left off. love the characters.:)
0064400557|5.0|I can't even count how many times I've read this book!  I wore it out a long time ago, so I was very happy to be able to replace it with a nice copy. I recommend this book for anyone, child or adult!  I'm 50 years old and still love it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am a fiction junkie.  I read 1 to 2 books each month.  I typically reserve my reading for the weekends and will spend 5-6 hours reading.  This book was the best.  The only negative I have to see is that you are going to desperately want to read book 2 in the series but its not out yet.  Sanderson's down fall is that he has too many projects going at once and sometimes take a while to get new books out.  That being said, READ THIS BOOK.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A lot like the facebook game frontierville. No begging for supplies to complete missions though so its even better. Fun and addictive.
B005PMNBPY|5.0|Most of the new songs are excellent - live portion is awesome, really captures Perry's vocals and Dave's guitar riffs.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Fun puzzle game i find myself playing it every few days.<br />very simple game that keeps you hooked.<br />Works great on the kindle fire
0316098329|4.0|It takes a few pages to know what's happening once you start reading this one, but soon you will be unable to put it down.  It's a very intriguing novel written from the unique perspective of a small child. I would deduct the 1/2 a star because near the end, the story fell flat and didn't seem to know what to do with itself.  All in all, an excellent read.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I loved this book,after reading the secret & the power this was inspiring and helpful in realizing how special each day is and to stop and be grateful for all our blessing,it's really makes life more meaningful and wonderful!, read all three books, it will change your life!!!

B0073XORCY|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece!  As a devoted Tull fan for 40+ years - who has not thought much about anything they have released since Heavy Horses to say I was pleasantly surprised by TAAB2 would be the understatement of a lifetime.  I have never written a review about anything in my entire life - but I was so impressed with TAAB2 that I felt compelled to write this.  Ian Anderson is modern day Michaelangelo - and TAAB2 is his masterwoek!  Congrats on this masterpiece Ian - what a beautiful and compelling album.  Looking forward to seeing this live in Houston in October!!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|corny storyline but aren't they all? if you like hidden objects games then you will LOVE this because that's ALL this one is aside from the little mini games in between the scenes and all of those are the same type. not hard but challenging enough to make it fun. not sure if it's worth $4.99 unless you are really into the hidden objects games.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game.Although everything that was in my town had every timer set back one hundred hours.I'm serious.But otherwise you should get this app.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is awesome you could do so much ive gotten through like hundred of games I liv it it is bcuz
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This a great movie. It truly depicts everything about Jesus's passion. It is extremely moving and powerful, and hard to get through. You really get an idea how intense God's love is for each of us. With that being said it is brutal to watch and pretty gory. I would say 15+ is a good age range due to it's graphic nature. Wonderfully screened, I can't find a single flaw in the production.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I really do believe that bad marketing killed this movie.  I saw it in the theaters and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, because of such bad press, the movie fell far short of its budget.  I strongly encourage anyone who is a fan of science fiction to give this movie a go--you will not be disappointed.  My hope is that the DVD/Blu-Ray sales are enough to prod someone to make a sequel--it's far worthier of one than many of the other franchises coming out of Hollywood.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|cool game. very fun to play. keeps me entertained for hours. i recommend this game if you like playing mario.
B004LUS390|4.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire a couple of days ago. The Sketchbook Mobile app is Version 1.3.6.0. Overall everything works as advertised....except one MAJOR thing: The import image into a new layer does not work. The program will let you get as far as selecting an image in your gallery but refuses to load it into your workspace. I've tried .gif, .jpg and .png images; Tiny and large file size images. Nothing will import. If I'm doing something wrong, I've yet to find a post that addresses the issue. I'm giving it 4 stars as the remaining features are fantastic to work with. I'll give it 5 stars when the import image feature is fixed.<br /><br />If any of you have found a work around, please let me know.<br /><br />As a side note, I downloaded Sketchbook mobile to my HTC Android phone. All features work perfectly, including the import image feature.

B005HSG3VK|3.0|I really bought this for the stand and yes I bought the cheapest cover. And while it works overall, it's disappointing that the bottom edge has some sharp jagged areas and the stand is felt on one side so it picks up everything and it is not that strong.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|App uses cameras' led light (which is so bright on my new Motorola Photon I could probably do surgery by it) OR the screen. U have &quot;infinite&quot; screen color choices which, when chosen for function, helps establish baseline brightness. Additionally u can tap the right side to actually adjust the brightness of the screen. Check the settings for some functional options.
0684859106|2.0|Have many cookbooks displayed in my kitchen - but looked forward to this one because of the reputation of the bakery and the hype surrounding the book.  Not impressed - I'm a long time baker and found nothing new here.  Most of these recipes can be found in your average cookbook.  Much ado about not a lot.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was intrigued by the title and the book cover so I purchased this book. The story surpassed my expectations.....I just kept reading and reading and didn't want to put it down. It was a mystery and fanstay rolled together into a well written story. I would suggest a hard cover rather than a Kindle though because of the pictures and copies of letters that are included.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it just like super Mario brothers love it. ital must play. fun fun fun !!!!!!! cute bugs love it love love love
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a good app to waste time on. it makes the time fly by. lots of fun for waiting rooms.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I found myself compelled to solve all the puzzles and find all the clues. It took several hours and there were definitely a few moments of frustration to enjoy. If you like a challenge and you're willing to stick with it, you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Similar to Myst.

B007MDB71O|5.0|This is the first time that anyone has done justice to Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The film was amazing!  Ms Collins by the way in this role is a strong enough reason for any man to watch it anyway.  The film though is simply spellbinding!
B004P68T30|4.0|Super please with the quality of this interactive Dr. Suess book.  My 2 year old loves the story and enjoys touching all the pictures.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|I hereby second the opinion of the reviewer who advised \\"First, shut down your critical faculties.\\"  I came here intending to say something similar: that 'Salmon Fishing' is a sweet, nice little movie...just don't try to over-analyze it.  Many aspects of the film won't withstand a fair level of scrutiny.  But if you called talented screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to task on any incongruities, his reaction would surely be: \\"What's your point?\\" Mr. Beaufoy is a spinner of screenplay gold - turning the dark novel [[ASIN:B003JTHSQ8 Q & A: A Novel]] into the uplifting [[ASIN:B001P9KR8U Slumdog Millionaire]] was a work of alchemy.  He works his magic here again.<br /><br />Of course, it doesn't hurt to have two winning, magnetic stars.  I like Ewan McGregor in pretty much everything (he, too, like Christopher Plummer, should have been nominated for his work in last year's [[ASIN:B0060M9T9U Beginners]]).  And, if you don't like Emily Blunt, you have no pulse.  Kristin Scott Thomas shows off her comedic chops here as the British PM's publicity flack.  It's an inch-deep role that she tackles with relish.  It's interesting that her roles in French seem so much more serious.  She's almost an entirely different actress in her second language.  Check out her work in  [[ASIN:B001M72J68 I've Loved You So Long]].  You'll never see finer acting.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|THE HELP was a wonderfully entertaining and interesting look at an era that most young Americans know little about and understand less. The characters were warm and believable, and made us care about what was happening to them. The details of life in the South in the 60s were generally accurate, if gently portrayed, and a lot could be learned from reading between the lines. Should be required reading/viewing in history and social studies classes everywhere!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|non violent variety of games it is great for kids of all ages my 8 yr old and i love it as much as my 3 yr old and as for the ads if you turn off your wifi I guess they don't bother u cause I have had no issues
1400069289|5.0|I want to first point out that this is not a self-help book per se.  It is detailed and entertaining reportage on the subject of habits -- how they are formed, influenced and control so many of the choices we make.  But the book is good enough that it can provide you with the insight and inspiration to alter your habits.<br /><br />Mr. Duhigg first deconstructs what forms a habit (cue --> routine --> reward) and then shows how individuals, organizations and societies establish or alter habits.  He does an impressive job researching the neuroscience and psychology behind the formation of habits; but unlike an academic, he knows how to take his source material (including dozens of interviews) and build it into a compelling narrative.<br /><br />You can read this to discover the psychological, environmental and physical determinants behind our habits, and you can also read this for inspiration on how you can identify the components of your own habits in order to change them.<br /><br />Erudite without being pretentious, with interesting examples and interview excerpts throughout, this is a great read.  My only criticism is that it seemed as if the author had chosen examples selectively to bolster his arguments that habits can be changed, but this is really a minor criticism.  Duhigg gives enough variations in his examples to lend the book overall credibility (from the world of science, business, recovery programs, the criminal justice system and so on).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|What!!! It didn't end with a Red Cross vehicle, a dog carrying brandy, or a male/female embracing each other saying cheesy things like a 'Nicolas Cage' film.  Oh my...  Some people went out and missed 'American Idol' for nothing that night.  The depth of this film is done in such a way, I felt like I was watching a foreign or independent film.  Survival of the soul people...  I refuse to ruin this film for others, some people will experience it differently and see different things. Another awesome thing about this kind of film...  With the amount of reviews for this movie, and the degree of polarized opinions, I would like to come to the conclusion that this movie effected people. Many of the reviews sound very reactional and emotional.  Something is different about this film, and I would lend to say it did it's job.  Perhaps one could make some interesting observations about the culture we are living in simply by reading through the 1000+ reviews written here. Something very different about this movie.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun. and a game to definently take a look at. just started but am already spending a ton of time on it.
B004XNPQUO|4.0|Great app for it is very interesting on the graphics it uses and very entertaining. My young Son uses it the most and he just loves it.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|When I got my Kindle, I knew I needed a cover. I've had this since the Kindle came out and honestly, it is amazing. No I don't work for the company. I find the inside soft and yet it holds the Kindle very well, it is hard to get the Kindle out with just banging it around.<br /><br />The reason I love it the most is that I am 225lbs. I didn't realize it was under a blanket I have hanging off my bed. I lost my Kindle for 5 days, and have stepped my full weight on it several times not realizing it was under there. I'm not just talking about simply stepping, I'm also talking about dancing, standing on it for a few moments, and generally putting a lot of weight on this case and a lot of that was with high heels on. Yet, when I realized it was there, I freaked, but found out that thanks to the case, the Kindle was completely unharmed. A friend of mine who weighs less broke her Kindle standing on hers on accident. So, this thing can easily hold 225 pounds without letting the Kindle get hurt or scratched in any way. There was a smudge from where the center part rested on it, but simply rubbing the glass with cloth removed said smudge. I'm extremely impressed with this.<br /><br />Plus, it works great.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is a nice new twist to and old classic. The new HD version is sharp on my Kendle Fire. But boy the price is steep for something that only took me a few hours to master. I hope they expand on this soon.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't get through this book, it was too painful. The writing was awful, the sex scenes were awful, the plot was awful, the use of the same words over and over was awful. The book was awful. Awful, awful, awful.<br /><br />If the overuse of the word \\"awful\\" in the previous paragraph distracted you, then you now understand how I felt after reading the first few chapters of this book. It was as though this author had 20 or so go to phrases, and used at least 2 or 3 of them on each page.<br /><br />I will admit I skipped ahead to get to the sex scenes, since that is what all the hype was about. I read the first sex scene and was as disappointed as I assumed I would be. The inner dialogue during the sex scene completely distracted from any sensuality. I stopped reading the book at that point, and have no urge to pick it up again. Amazon will let you read the first few pages and I highly recommend that you do, and don't make the mistake of thinking it will get better, because the writing doesn't, and I have read better erotica in letters to penthouse.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Since I was about 6 years old, I've been a fan of the \\"monster movie.\\"  On a rainy Saturday I was bored to tears and sat down with my daughter's kindle and thought, \\"What the heck! Let's see what Troll Hunter is about.\\"  I got sucked into the movie in less than five minutes.  Decided to watch on the computer instead and totally enjoyed myself.  Since that fateful Saturday both my husband and 8 year old daughter have watched as well.  We love this movie!!!!  Who'd have thought that trolls die because they can't process vitamin D?  Brilliant.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really fun I liked it a lot well kinda if you like Mario you will like this a lot I know that I did
B00003CX9W|5.0|So glad I could find this on Amazon to have for the next generation!  I remember seeing it as a kid and now I can give my grandkids the same thrill.  I can't think of a single time when I couldn't find an older dvd I wanted provided by Amazon.  It arrived within the alloted time frame and was packaged.  Pricing was very reasonable, another good find on Amazon.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|IT it VERY COOL and FUN to PLAY too.If you like to being a Ninja and like Fruit your love this game
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. very relaxing and runs beautifully on my kindle fire.  only issue is with the landscape mode in that it only allows you to play it with left side of fire down vs either right or left side down
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good games for free . yeah, they are adds, but the game is free and not to hard to play.
0741470314|5.0|The book is very interesting to read.¨It describes different aspects of his life in detail.<br />The chapter about Michael Jackson as a daddy was heartwarming to read, while other chapters almost brought me to tears.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Admittedly, this show is a touch \\"soap-opera-ish\\". Well, my guess about what soap operas would be anyway... But only in that it deals with interpersonal drama within a family. That aside, the cinematography is outstanding, the acting excellent, and the story is a really good one. There are only a few TV shows I enjoy - and all of those via DVD - this might be the best one I've watched in quite a while.<br /><br />As a side note, the authenticity of the sets is impressive, if that sort of thing is important to you.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book not only taught me about my feet, but was a great read and was a very interesting book. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I got this free and have found it to be better than any other calendar app I've found so far. Easy to use, no problems setting repeats, pretty good visuals. My only gripe is that it doesn't have an option for a calendar view -- only vertical list, color-coded to indicate immediacy and urgency. What it does, though, it does well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game reminds me of Mario bros easy controls and easy to play.  great game for all ages to play
B006L9B6TI|4.0|The Magic by Rhonda Byrne is similar to her other two books, The Secret & The Power.  This book asks you to spend each day on a different topic and concentrate on that topic while feeling grateful.  It requires a bit of \\"work\\" in that regard, but it is well worth it if you want change in your life.  I recommend this book, as I do her others mentioned above.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is lots of fun and like others have said it is a lot like Mario.  I like it and my kids will too.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|After all the hype, and many of my friends insisting I read the book, I did. I'm glad Amazon take Kindle returns.<br /><br />The story is incredibly banal. The characters are flat, and the editing is very bad. Katniss, I just want to throttle: she's the least likable heroine I've personally ever read, and she doesn't grow or develop at all during the book. No, she's as flat & lifeless as the villains are boring & trite.<br /><br />I know it seems harsh, and it probably is, but this is a very unintelligent book in every sense. It might be a fun ride for some (many), but it just pained me to try & read this mess. I could nitpick, but it's just not worth the time for me to do so. That's my opinion. Take it for what it's worth.
B0077DBZXO|4.0|WE REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE.<br />PRODUCT HAS A BAD SET BACK IF YOU PURCHASE THIS MOVIE YOU CAN ONLY VIEW IT ON LINE. IF YOU PAY ABOUT 20 BUCKS FOR AN ITEM YOU SHOULD GET A DISC TO WATCH ANYWHERE. JUST AS WELL WENT TO WAL-MART TO PURCHASE.

0763644765|5.0|I had my reservations that my obstinate child would want to read this book (I have another potty book that he could care less about), but he loves this book.  It's incredibly simple, and I personally don't see why he likes it so much, but it's incredibly effective.  I leave this book by the potty, and he likes to read it everytime he goes.  YES!  He goes on the potty, thanks in part to this book.  In fact, having this book to read proved more of a reward for him than stickers.  Who knew.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|you know i know about Richard Armitage because i rented MI-5&lt;called usa> i thought yeah He was great actor and very handsome guy.. but I did not  get into it...

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Wow, as I got further and further into this boring disaster of a novel, I questioned what on earth had made me buy it. Then I came back here and saw all those positive reviews (which must have influenced me at the time) and I.just.don't.get.it. This book is lousy. I was after a nice light romantic read, a little escapism, and I got stuck with this stupid, droning, self-absorbed teenager's diary in novel form. Character development is haphazard, completely unrealistic and inconsistent and there's pretty much just one uninteresting story line. Subplots? Depth? I am not one to stop reading any book I start so I kept going with this one, possibly at least 75% thru, and finally just let myself set it aside. What a waste of time.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|This is a very compelling read that raises big questions about social structure, ethics and morality. The technical aspects such as network security are highly accurate but the author tells the story in such a way that the technical details don't bore non-technical people.<br /><br />Freedom http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-TM-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0525951571 is a somewhat different type of book, but personally I like it even better.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Another great Studio Gibley movie! Amazon, has been the best place to buy these movies... Not to many other people sell them! The price is right and the movies are fantastic... I like most that they aren't mainstream movies.. very sweet and cute!
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I've always had the utmost respect for the music of the Foo Fighters (funny thing, the first time I heard their name, I thought they were the \\"food fighters\\", which, if you think about it, actually makes more sense). I still think they could have come up with a better band name, but I digress. This a good album in my view, with a majority of the tracks being the quality we have long expected from the foo fighters. I do recommend this album to anyone who likes this kind of my music.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Another great Studio Gibly movie! This movie, is very cute and funny! left my kids, laughing and me too actually!
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|So many movies nowadays have a hard time standing alone -- if you don't read the book you \\"miss out\\" on a lot of what's going on. I liked this movie a lot (and I like many of the Jane Austen adaptations) because you can get into it easily without having read the book, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys movies set in this era (or is needing something similar to a Downton Abbey fix.)
1451673442|5.0|Having read both the Secret and the Power, I was living my life according to the principles of the Law of Attraction but in the spring of 2011 I stopped and the following 12 months were awful. I needed help and so asked the Universe for guidance and as if by magic, Rhonda Byrne brings out a new book - the Universe truly is all seeing :)<br /><br />I currently live in Austria and so had to wait about a week for the book to arrive but it was worth it. This time the book is set out with daily exercises, some that are repeated everyday, some which are for a specific topic but all help to form a better life using gratitude.<br /><br />And the Magic truly works, the week after receiving the book, I landed my dream job and everything is just getting better and better everyday. So I say a big THANK YOU to Rhonda Byrne and the Universe for bringing the Magic back into my life :)
B003H4RDZQ|1.0|David Sedaris was recommended to me by several friends who, like myself, enjoy sarcastic, dark and witty humor. While this book may contain a mildly funny passage or two in a ho-hum kind of way, it is completely devoid of any wit. Holidays on Ice appears to be Sedaris' desperate attempt to copy some of the humor found in drastically exaggerating the facts - as applied very successfully by authors like Bill Bryson or Peter Mayle. Unfortunately Sedaris completely fails in doing so.<br /><br />The first Santa Land story made me smile, but then the remainder of the book is like a stand-up routine gone terribly wrong. Knowing that it was intended to be fiction, I wasn't particularly troubled by the baby in the dryer part, but the way Sedaris wrote that story was so angry and over-the-top, lacking any kind of intelligent humor or wit. Half way into each story you feel like saying \\"OK David, I got it\\" but at that point he's usually just getting started.<br /><br />This is my first book review on Amazon. The only reason I felt compelled to write it, was to warn other readers on how uninspiring and non-entertaining I found it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great fun.  lots of options.  free and the ads are not annoying- they only pop up between hands.  get it- you'll enjoy it!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|So, I don't get why people are falling over this series so much. I mean, its good, but it isn't the best book in the world. My friends are all gushing about like \\"Oh my gosh this is the best book in the universe.\\" I personally like this series and I will be reading them I just don't get why it is now like a national phenomenon. Like what happened with the Harry Potter series, it wasn't the best but it was still good.
B007HNFREW|5.0|I had been contemplating reading the books...I typically like this genre anyways...when I saw that Game of Thrones was out on DVD...I had a feeling this was going to be good especially with Sean Bean as the major character in Season One. I rented the first two espisodes and then I bought the DVD. It was pretty easy to pick up what was going on even though I did not read the book. I usually like to read the books first...I do think I am going to buy the book. I have to say...this show is not for children or as someone else said \\"not for the faint of heart\\" as it is extremely violent. However, having said that...the storyline and the characters are great...I love the show...watched it twice and I am looking forward to Seaason Two.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This app is clever but unfortunately it needs a little refinement. You combine objects to create new things which can result in both amusing and baffling results. The trouble is a user often fails to understand what was in the developers head so you end up spending quite a bit of time randomly combining things in the hopes of a result. This gets especially tedious in the first 4 episodes. However once you plow through those you unlock the bonus rounds which are short and quite a bit of fun. I'd love to see more short, themed rounds.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i love the new gameplay. my kyros plays it just fine. i have a 32gig card in mine, perhaps thats why.

B004QOB8SO|3.0|While I hate lowering my rating of such an otherwise excellent production to 3 stars, Sherlock's sophomore effort was beleagured with fundamental problems too numerous and glaring to be overlooked. There were serious weaknesses pertaining to characterization, plot continuity, and gratuitous amounts of fan service inserted to such an extent as to negatively effect the cleverness, intellectual integrity,character portrayals, and scripting that contributed to making series 1 so outstanding.<br /><br />The blame, I am sorry to say, lies squarely on the shoulders of Steven Moffat for distorting so thoroughly every element that comprised the first episode, 'A Scandal In Belgravia'. About 60% of the way through ASiB, I honestly had to wonder what on earth was this garbled, puerile nonsense I was watching, and more importantly, what did it have to do with Sherlock Holmes? The episode seemed nothing but a poorly written work of fan fiction and some James Bond/Dr Who-esque conglomeration.<br /><br />That aside, the travesty that was episode one began with the cliffhanger \\"resolution\\", which was utterly ridiculous, a complete cop out, and left us with several glaring loose ends and outright plot holes. Disappointing as it was, I was eager to forgive this because, well, series 2 was here (!). But the already weak episode went downhill the moment Irene Adler's character stepped on screen. No, I don't care a whit she was made into a lesbian dominatrix. I was actually excited about the prospect as I thought that was inserted to prevent her from being viewed as some love interest, which she most decidedly was NOT in Canon. But oh, how wrong I was to be proven...<br /><br />There was not even an attempt made at presenting her as the clever woman of Doyle's stories, the only woman to ever outwit Holmes, who forced the misogynistic detective to rethink his stance on a female's wit. Here, there is no respect and admiration of Adler on Sherlock's part, as Moffat's Adler does not use even one brain cell throughout, and Sherlock is too busy having a sulk. Adler's cleverness is all smoke and mirrors, even going so far as making her into a damsel in distress at the end. The script quickly degrades to the point where nothing in this episode can be looked at as redeemable. It was cheapened into nothing but sexual tension, and was easily the most shallow, superficial take on the story ever achieved. Holmes' character was was so far beyond recognizable (NOT the fault of the estimable Benedict Cumberbatch, but of the script) it was actually painful to watch. I cringed at frequent intervals and was so put off by this episode, I was ready to abandon the series entirely.<br /><br />'The Hounds of Baskerville' and 'The Reichenbach Fall', however, were a vast improvement over Moffat's failed attempt, and were more than worthy of the series. The latter two writers successfully cleared away the clutter that could not be utilized in updating the original Canon stories, stripping plots down to the bare bones and giving us something engaging, well written and credible. More importantly, we see the characterizations click back into place despite profound liberties being taken with the stories themselves. Mark Gatiss is a phenomenal pastiche and horror writer, and I was excited to see how he drastically changed HOUN without sacrificing an iota of who the characters were, and gave us a genuinely frightening, engaging story in the process.<br /><br />And as poignantly acted and scripted as the final episode was, I think a vast amount of credit should go to Steve Thompson for two things. First, for taking the criticisms he received for The Blind Banker and using them to improve his craft and giving us what could be the finest episode to date, both characterization and scripting wise. Secondly, for taking Molly, a character created by the disgustingly misogynistic Steven Moffat (who should truly be kept from writing any female characters ever again, god spare us all) andturned her into a phenomenal entity in her brief but instrumental scenes. Well done, sir. In fact, it was the efforts of the latter two writers and the outstanding performances of both Cumberbatch & Freeman who brought Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson to life that entirely redeemed this programme for me. And while ASiB unfortunately did force me to lower my overall rating, it's worth mentioning that the THOB and TRF are well deserving of five stars apiece.turned her into a phenomenal entity in her brief but instrumental scenes.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I don't understand why there are so many 1 star reviews for this app. The game clearly says in the description that you start with 10 games and you have to continue to play to unlock the rest. Overall, the games are a great way to keep yourself or your children entertained while experiencing down time. As you unlock new games there are enough of a variety that you don’t get bored of them and are fun for any age.  As an adult you may get tired of playing it, but let’s be honest these game are meant for the younger age bracket.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|As a stuffy Canon purist who despised the first movie for its painfully out of character portrayals and Holmes' utter slovenliness, I can say with honesty that despite my reservations,'A Game of Shadows' not only outshined its predecessor, at its heart was more substance than I ever thought possible for what I'd dismissed as a mindless action flick. Guy Ritchie clearly took pains to correct much of what was broken in his '09 effort, from the little touches to the major issues regarding the disjointed feel to his directing. I was relieved to note that there were improvements made in cleaning up Holmes' intolerable slovenliness - though by no means does he display the \\"quiet primness of dress\\" Watson wrote him as having, he is slightly more of a conventionally dressed gentleman here. Slightly. And while RDJ's Holmes is far from the \\"quiet thinker of Baker Street\\", here we see performances that become entirely more recognizable.<br /><br />The modernity and steampunk elements have been toned down somewhat, and the fact that two completely different (and talented) writers had scripted this one was glaringly obvious. We have a Holmes whose intelligence has been dulled for the sake of comic relief, I am sad to say, but in this film it is done in a more tolerable - even endearing - manner. I also confess to despising Jude Law's Watson in the first film, for what I thought was an uncalled for level of hostility. Best of all was the fact that the razor edge to his character was blunted in the sequel, and we we are given a Watson who is exasperated, yet lurking underneath was a palpable fondness not present in the first installment. I could believe that underneath it all was a friendship, and that honestly made all the difference in convincing me this was the man who would willingly follow Holmes to the ends of the earth. We are shown the camaraderie and affection between Holmes and Watson that existed in Doyle's stories, and understand how it hurt them both when the doctor marries Mary Morstan. Regardless of how you view their relationship, this did pain Holmes in Canon, and I've never seen that heartbreak rendered so beautifully and respectfully as it was here.<br /><br />I was especially taken with Jared Harris' performance as Professor Moriarity, and the back story surrounding him has quickly become a favourite with me. He was quite convincing as an amoral intellect to rival the foremost mind of his time - when they clash, it is genuinely frightening, and the shivers come not because we think he's some volatile nutter, but because his decided lack of a conscience becomes a true counterweight to Holmes' sense of justice. Holmes of Canon was a flawed man (why we love him, honestly) but he was also a good man. He would have come to the same conclusions about humanity and the coming wars as Moriarity did in this film, but opposed them all the same. He is a worthy opponent, and we feel this throughout.<br /><br />Of course, I had my issues, mainly with the overdone action sequences that I find boring and the scene in the train where Holmes is decked out in drag. But these quibbles are easy to overlook when the movie was such a fresh take on 'The Final Problem', when we were given such a beautiful representation of the love (whether you see it platonic or otherwise) between Holmes and Watson, and that memorable ending scene where all Holmes' logic is cast to the wayside with one selfless act. It was truly gorgeous, and elevated this from being just another action flick to an actual relevant movie pastiche. While it doesn't approach the loyalty as that of the BBC adaptation, it does do ACD's immortal characters justice this time around.<br /><br />And whether you are a Sherlockian (who possibly loathed the '09 movie) or just interested in the mystery/action elements, I doubt you'll regret seeing this.arries Mary Morstan.

B006QVRVJK|3.0|Even though I bought it wrapped, brand-new and direct from amazon, the DVD itself is definitely of second-rate quality. It skips and gets stuck at times. I have 3 different players and each showed the same poor quality. It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy. It is a pity, because there are so many details that are essential to the movie and are meant to be visual and tangible to the plot. Perhaps a better copy will be released in the future.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I, for one, think the reviews of this book have been too harsh. With a cast of characters this deep it would be impossible to tie everything up neatly. Would I have liked Dani to meet up with Tyrion and Jorah? To know what really happens with Jon and Stannis? To find Cersei guilty of treason and executed? Yes, of course! But these mysteries will be uncovered in the next books. Please be patient.<br /><br />I agree with reviewers who say book 4 was different from the first three. More new characters were thrown into the mix in book 4 making this an amazing juggling act for GRRM. How could he cover the entire starting line up when so many new characters must be defined? I applaud the vast scope of this project and do not envy our beloved author who has to keep all the characters straight, much less moving forward. There's a lot to knit together and only two more books to do it in. I simply cannot wait! This is a saga I have enjoyed each step of the way. I look forward to each book and cannot wait for book 6!
B0073XORCY|4.0|Ian Anderson has always done a masterful job of changing his musical styles, while keeping old themes alive that can only be Ian Anderson.  This has allowed him to capture new fans at the risk of losing a few old ones.  Ian (Tull) have always shifted and changed directions, but always travel on familar grounds.  Once again, Ian has done it.<br /><br />With his voice finding a comfort zone, Ian weaves a magical trail of singing and talking to express the what-ifs, maybes and might-have-beens in all our lives.  The poetry is cerebral, the musicianship supberb and the music toe-tapping.  However, don't expect to it to click right away.  The whole is better than the parts (although many of the parts are wonderfully filling) and the whole is delicious. Like all of Ians projects, it takes several listens for the brain to taste and digest all the flavors running in and about.  Let the music perculate with several spins and your brain will feel the ZAP.<br /><br />Musically light years away from TAAB, TAAB2 has a style all its own.  Very organic in sound, and should play great live.  TAAB2 is a great follow up on the story of Gerald Bostock.  Mr. Bostock is in all of us.  Small and large events can change the roads we travel on, but perhaps our individual roads will eventually all end in the same location.  Or, maybe not.<br /><br />Most definitely worth the investment.  Hopefully, Ian makes enough sales to at least cover the cost and maybe he'll come out with something else before he turns 80.  His projects are a bit slow in coming the last couple of decades.<br /><br />If it's Ian, if it's Tull, many sounds of new, and some sounds of old. Will Ian give us more? Why-nots, perhaps and wait-and-sees.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter was a fun corny action movie based off of Edgar Rice Burrow's<br />Book Princess of Mars. It was a masterpiece that was not recognized as a masterpiece. The acting was very good, which made up for the cornyness of the film. The special effects were very good as well, along with the score. Director Andrew Stanton, did fairly good at portraying the John Carter we all love, those of us who have read the book. Taylor Kitsh did an amazing job acting the part. When I walked into the theater I was expecting good but not great. I was wrong

I saw this movie in Chicago with my wife when it came out and nearly walked out before it was over; had it not been a slow night with bad weather I probably would have. My advice, don't let the Disney name draw you in because this movie isn't worth watching for free on cable.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario, but 10x better. I luvvvv this game!!!!! it is spool much fun and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Mario!
B0072PUC7W|4.0|I've been buying Armin's State of Trance series since the beginning & although his mixing is immaculate he, for obvious commercial reasons, includes a few more vocal house flavored tracks than the purest trance lover, myself included, would prefer. Sasha & Digweed are a good comparison to what I'm referring to. In any event this latest Van Buuren release will no doubt satisfy most of his loyal fans in both the trance & house genre's.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is everything that zombie entertainment should be but seldom is.<br />It's a logical, yet heartfelt portrayal of the global ramifications of what would actually happen in a Zombie Apocalypse, and showing the hope that mankind can learn from its mistakes and would find ways, whether they be heartless or ingenious, to fight off this new enemy.
1250008409|3.0|This book helps you deal with worry and negative thinking.  The author is a monk and describes in many pages what the life of a monk is like, how they may meditate eighteen hours a day.  It made me wonder what can you find to meditate about for that long.  He also describes life in a monastary.  He begins the book with a very long introduction - thirty six pages - of what to expect when reading this book.  He devotes pages to his personal life and experiences in taking ten to relax.  He explains how to meditate and how to breathe.  He lists  exercises to do in  every chapter.  I had heard about mindfulness before so I found that most of this book was common sense.  It is basically to be very aware of everything that you are doing at the moment, this will take you away from negative thinking and worry.  Be aware of the sounds and sights around you, what your body is doing etc.  At the end of the book he has lists of questions to ask yourself every day to measure your success in doing the take ten procedure.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love this fun flying game. Hours of fun for the whole family and playing on our Kindle makes the game more awesome.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I almost never review anything, but I am willing to go through the trouble to review this one. First off you need to understand that this simply fools your ps3 into thinking that your keyboard and mouse are the controller, so if you're looking for something that will allow you to plug in your keyboard and mouse and then it will read your mind and do exactly what you want then stop reading this now because you're an idiot. Second if you're willing to invest $60 to buy this then you can take the 15 mins to set it up and adjust it. I still adjust sensitivity settings on my pc. I play Battlefield 3 with this all the time and it feels like I'm playing on my pc. Controller joysticks don't have acceleration that a mouse has but again if you take the time to calibrate it to how you feel is right, I promise you won't be able to tell the difference. Furthermore penguin have awesome support, if you have a problem post it on the forums and they will get back to you the same day.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, is a young adult novel about the dark future of post-war America. The story is written from the perspective of Katniss Everdeen; a 16 year old girl struggling to survive with her mother and sister in one of twelve districts controlled by a dictating President Snow from the Capitol. The Capitol holds an annual Hunger Games to maintain fear control over the districts. The Capitol randomly selects one male and one female from each district to fight to the death on televised screens around the country. This years Hunger Games tell the story of Katniss and a district 12 boy, Peeta Mallark, who fight against all odds including the Capitol to become the winner of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Read the rest of this review along with other books I've read at...<br /><br />[...]
055357342X|5.0|I read this book during my free time at work. Not during every waking second of my free time, but on and off for over a year. I never felt like I had lost my place. The actions and answers that are served up in this book do a good job of tying up some loose ends of the first book. My only advice is not to take a year to read it like I did, because the series deserves better.
0684857219|4.0|It's a great resource useful in all aspects in bodybuilding. The only negative to some may be that there is so much information it can seem overwhelming. If your serious or just curious about bodybuilding this is a good pickup. If large amounts of info intimidate you .... Run!
B0073XORCY|5.0|I've been a Jethro Tull fan over 40 years and own all their recordings and Ian's solo stuff also...been to 9 Tull concerts.  TAAB2 sounds just like a Jethro Tull record that could have been made in the 70s.  What more could a Tull fan ask for?  I am on my third listen since I got the Special Edition yesterday.  It shouldn't be judged by hearing a song or two...it's best when heard all the way through.  It's a piece of music that builds in intensity and excitement as it plays through to the end.  I am thrilled with TAAB2 and proud that Ian is able to write 5 star music at age 65.  I haven't gotten to the dvd yet and may add to this review when I watch it.
B0018CWEYY|2.0|What happened to you lost? So much potential, so much mystery and so much tension. It began to unravel somewhere between the second and third season. This was my second attempt watching the series and once again I couldn't get past the second or third episode. Too bad. OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus.
B000Y5JFNY|3.0|This movie is uplifting, optimistic, and cheerful in the best way. I wanted to purchase the DVD so my children could enjoy the movie and music the way I did when I was little. There are lots of bonus items: a musical box, postcards, a book about the history of the movie, etc... This is what I regret. I should have just bought the DVD without all the extras (if you are an uber-fan you might want all these items as part of your collection). However, I know I'll simply watch the movie and not touch the other items which makes it a waste of materials and money. It was a great price considering what they put into the collection, though.

B007N31ZBU|5.0|The Sting\\" is the 1973 comedy caper from George Roy Hill that cemented the A list status of stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. It was nominated for 10 Oscars and won 7 (including Picture, Director, Screenplay, Original Music). It earned more than $150,000,000 and was #2 at the box office. AFI lists it among the top 400 films of all time. The film was based on the real life story of two grifters in the 1940 book \\"The Big Con\\" by David Maurer, although many of the plot points can be found in Orson Welles' 1951 radio program \\"The Lives of Harry Lime\\".<br /><br />Interestingly enough it was Redford who got the Oscar nomination as Best Actor - the only time his acting was ever acknowledged despite more than 50 films, many of which were top box office. In his career Newman garnered 10 nominations and one win.<br /><br />In addition to Newman and Redford who play the grifters, Robert Shaw (1927-78) plays a villainous gambler, Charles Durning (1923) plays a detective, and Ray Walston (1914-2001) and Harold Gould (1923-2010) play fellow grifters.<br /><br />The film featured \\"ragtime\\" music from Scott Joplin (1867-1917) and was responsible for a revival of interest in his music. The film also started a host of films about grifters, including \\"House of Games\\" (1987), \\"The Grifters\\" (1990), \\"Matchstick Men\\" (2003), and \\"Shade\\" (2003).<br /><br />Director George Roy Hill (1921-2002) made only 12 films and was nominated for an Oscar twice - both times for films featuring Newman and Redford, and won for this one. His other notable films include \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" (1972) and \\"The World According to Garp\\" (1982).<br /><br />1973 was a good year for films. The top grossing films were \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"The Sting\\", \\"American Graffiti\\", \\"Enter the Dragon\\" and \\"Papillion\\". \\"The Sting\\" won Oscars for Picture and Director, and the rest of the Oscars were evenly distributed among \\"Save the Tiger\\" (Actor), \\"A Touch of Class\\" (Actress), \\"The Paper Chase\\" (Supporting Actor), and \\"Paper Moon\\" (Supporting Actress). Other films released that year included \\"Magnum Force\\", \\"Serpico\\",  \\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\\", \\"The Long Goodbye\\", \\"Mean Streets\\", \\"The Stone Killer\\", and \\"Walking Tall\\".<br /><br />Roger Ebert called the film \\"one of the most stylish movies of the year\\" and noted that it \\"has a nice, light-fingered style to it.\\" Vincent Canby at the NY Times called it \\"good natured\\", \\"hilarious\\" and \\"with a bit of Laurel and Hardy thrown in.\\"<br /><br />The plot may seem complicated and/or convoluted to some people, but don't let that stop you from sitting back and enjoying the film. Watch it a second time if you want to be able to explain all the details.<br /><br />Bottom line - a true Hollywood classic.oon\\" (Supporting Actress).

0071636080|4.0|Admittedly, I have not read the biography of Steve Jobs, although I would like to. This book contains more text than some of the recent books I have read on presentation tips. But, I found that I could effectively scan it because the author has laid out compact chapters (or \\"scenes\\" as they are called) along with effectively segregated sidebars of information. There's high value in reading these sidebars of information because they convey several things. First off, they are a wonderful walk down memory lane in terms of Jobs' past presentations as well as Apple marketing in general. Reading the first \\"I'm a Mac. I'm a PC.\\" commercial made me laugh, for example.<br /><br />After having read Garr Reynolds' \\"The Naked Presenter\\" (which I recommend), Slide:ology by Nancy Duarte, and Speak Like Churchill; Stand Like Lincoln (another that I recommend), there's very little to mine by reading additional books. However, regardless of the presentation tips I got out of this (and I definitely got some), the alternative value to this is the insight into how Jobs' marketing mind worked. The author effectively puts Jobs' words into tables paired up with Jobs' corresponding actions, gestures, or slides. This side-by-side effect helps you immediately picture the presentation Jobs gave even if you did not witness it, but the blow-by-blow breakdown helps the reader to dissect the key actions that made Jobs a genius at presenting.<br /><br />I may read Steve Jobs' biography in the near future, but the stories presented here about jobs not only offered me insight into his presentation style but his overall thought process and a memorable history of his success. That alone was worth the price of admission.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great. app.  only thing I don't like is that it can take awhile to load. great variety of games.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I'm a Huge fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars Books and the Mars art of Frank Frazetta too, so this sword & martian Princess-lousy project is dear too me. Without Carter there would never have been a Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers, but as result the promise seems cliched now, Hell!..even Superman's super leaping is direct from JC, Lucas' flying sand barges & Leia's Princess of Mars look... all ERB.... in addition to that concern the project has changed hands so many times since 2004, Robert Rodriguez who upon leaving the Directors Guild became ineligible, then kerry Conrad,  the director of the retro \\"Sky Capt. Film\\" ,the late Frazetta was on board  , the initial budget was 100 mil , currently Jon Favreau  was replaced by Andrew Stanton (who may never have directed a live action film before). So I'm concerned. Over all great stuff, sadly for DvD it needs to be seen on a big screen,  Mostly the story sticks to the Princess of Mar story that introduces John Carter, an ex-confederate soldier to Mars a.k.a. BARSOOM and to super powers maybe even a new  cause to fight for.
B004LUS390|4.0|I am not an artist but I've been a pen & paper doodler for years. This app does a great job of letting me tinker around with digital drawing and, from what I can tell, introduces some features that a PC drawing program would offer (layers, etc.). I would have given this a five-star rating but if it weren't for one major flaw. My android tablet is resistive touch and doesn't offer multiple point contact so I can't pinch and zoom. Because they don't offer any other method to zoom (that I can find), this is a big downer and reduces its value significantly for me. If the DEVs read this, please offer an alternate zoom method! To everybody else, even with this flaw I still ponied up the $2 to buy the app.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game! even my kids are into it! i am so happy that we found this app. my husband tries to not let us see him play but he always gets caught. we know he loves it too!

038572179X|4.0|Beautifully written novel that really immerses the reader in different worlds- the 1930s country house, the chaos of WW2 Dunkirk and a British hospital of the same era.<br />I also really admired McEwan's ability to describe the mind of a 13 year old girl on the cusp of adulthood.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|First Thought-<br />Oh darn. Please oh please no more lame witch and vampire romances. :( But the summary is just so enticing!<br /><br />What I liked-<br />I was litteraly blown away. I flew across my room becuase it was just so magical. Ha no not literally I was just so engrossed that I couldn't put it down. I proudly read it in one sitting. I thinks its halarious that poor Sophia gets harrassed by a bible thumper in the beginning but after that I had no clue what was going to happen next. In my head I was like, this girl is a loser, an outcast. She sucks at life really. Even her own momma is disappointed in her. I really wish she wasnt hated so much though. Heres why her life sucks; she tried a simple positive energy ritual that just went wrong, she has a curse listening to voices in her head all day, she found a dead body a long time ago and people still think she killed him. But it all changes the night after that spell gone wrong. The very next day Ivory her best friend convinces her to party and thats the night she catches unwanted attention.<br /><br />What I disliked-<br />I was so confused about the different charcteristics of the elementals. Sophia learns about them later on in the book. I had a hard time keeping up with who is what and what is who. At one point I cried becuase Ivory was my favorite character, and well ,you dont want to know what happens to her. I accidently got a smudge of mascara on my kindle too. :(<br /><br />Overall Readability-It rocked my mismatched socks off. It's fast, easy to get into, and just awesome. So you might be tired of witch or vampire romance, well that doesn't matter becuase this book blows your mind epically with witty comebacks, death wishes, and elemental powers. The Forever Girl won my heart over Twilight.<br /><br />My Final Thought-Fly little birdy fly! &lt;-My favorite bird Red :) Oh and I thought, HOLY CRAP. Excuse my language please but its just I can't wait for the second one. I must know what happens!<br /><br />5 out of 5 Haunted Roses/>5 out of 5 Haunted Roses

B00536OCYG|2.0|I just received my 2nd copy of this new vinyl release. The 1st copy had a big ding and scuff mark on disc 2 side 3. Either it was dropped on something or something was dropped on it. The 2nd copy had a concentration of small white gouges on disc 2 side 4. These were not defects or contaminants that could be removed by cleaning. These defects were dug into the vinyl. Indeed, I cleaned the records with a VPI HW 16.5 wet/vac cleaning machine, scrubbing the areas with L'art Duson cleaning fluid and a Record Doctor brush. The jackets were not damaged, so something happened after pressing and before/during packaging.<br /><br />So, for $50 and bold audiophile claims, I give up on this new pressing of this record. It is a shame that a few defects ruined to me what is a very good remastering job/pressing. The sound level is much quieter than the original pressing, requiring the volume to be turned up. Even so, the vinyl was very noise-free, until the defects were played.<br /><br />Pink Floyd is 1 for 3 with their new vinyl Immersion reissues: DSOTM and The Wall thumbs down, WYWH thumbs up.
0439023513|3.0|But, alas, I cannot.  Collins spent two books hashing out wonderfully well rounded characters only to run them through a cheap 3 a.m. sci-fi movie plot gauntlet at the end.  I get it.  War is horrible.  I also get that she seemed rushed to make a publisher deadline.  At least, that is what I took away from it.  However, in the end, I think this book will make the absolute best movie of the three novels.<br /><br />And, by best movie, I mean the best action movie.  Properly directed and with a large enough budget, the CGI on the film version of this story could be phenomenal.  PODS=Summer Blockbuster say summer '14 or '15?<br /><br />I still cried when she was grieving with the cat at the end about Prim.  The rest of the story I could have done without.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is the best book I have read in a long time. I bought the book on Sunday and a finished it tonight. Had a hard time putting the book down.
B00563M11M|5.0|Pratchett in good form again. Vimes is quite possibly my favourite character, and he delivers again. The usual Pratchett humour is there, as well as Vimes' hard-boiled cynical view of the world. I loved it.

0142001104|4.0|The authors best summarize what this book is about in the opening paragraph: \\"This is a how-to book of an unusual kind. Unlike the genre of how-to books that offer strategies to surmount the hurdles of a competitive world and move out ahead, the objective of this book is to provide the reader the means to lift off from that world of struggle and sail into a vast universe of possibility. Our premise is that many of the circumstances that seem to block us in our daily lives may only appear to do so based on a framework of assumptions we carry with us. Draw a different frame around the same set of circumstances and new pathways come into view. Find the right framework and extraordinary accomplishment becomes an everyday experience. Each chapter of this book presents a different facet of this approach and describes a new practice for bringing possibility to life.\\"<br /><br />As described above, this book is filled with rich, uplifting stories that help us look at our lives, both personal and professional under new paradigms. These paradigms will help unlock more potential as well as improve well being both physical and mental.<br /><br />An inspiring and enjoyable read!<br /><br />Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"The lesson I learned is that the player who looks least engaged, may be the most committed member of the group. A cynic, after all, is a passionate  person who does not want to be disappointed again.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"We keep looking so hard in life for the \\"specific message,\\" and yet we are blinded to the fact that the message is all around us, and within us all the time. We just have to stop demanding that it be on our terms and conditions, and instead open ourselves to the possibility that what we seek may be in front of us all the time.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"Now, in light of my \\"discovery\\", I began to shift my attention to how effective I was at enabling the musicians to play each phrase as beautifully as they were capable. This concern had rarely surfaced when my position appeared to give me absolute power and I had cast the players as mere instruments of my will.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"Humor can bring us together around our inescapable foibles, confusions, and miscommunications, and especially over the ways in which we find ourselves acting entitled and demanding, or putting people down, or flying into each other's throats.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"When one person peels away layers of opinion, entitlement, pride, and inflated self-description, others instantly feel the connection.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"The practice in this chapter is an antidote both to the hopeless resignation of the cow and to the spluttering resistance of the duck. It is to be present to the way things are, including our feelings about the way things are. This practice can help us clarifu the next step that will take us in the direction we say we want to go.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"There is viability, a life force, an energy, a quickening, that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine ow good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open\\" - Martha Graham<br /><br />8- \\"Gracing yourself with responsibility for everything that happens in your life leaves your spirit whole, and leaves you free to choose again.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"Love is neither about self-determination nor sacrifice. It is a context in which two people build the life they want together. Strength and independence are qualities that can enhance a relationship.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"In the realm of possibility, there is no division between ideas and action, mind and body, dream and reality. Leaders who become their vision often seem uncommonly braveto the rest of us. Whether from the middle of the action, or from the sidelines, they are a conduit for carrying the vision forward.\\"<br /><br />11- \\"...A vision releases us from the weight and confusion of local problems and concerns, and allows us to see the long clear line.\\"to the rest of us. Whether from the middle of the action, or from the sidelines, they are a conduit for carrying the vision forward.\\"<br /><br />11- \\"...A vision releases us from the weight and confusion of local problems and concerns, and allows us to see the long clear line.\\"

B006FTCH2E|1.0|This is the only 99 cent movie I have ever felt cheated on. As others have pointed out it is SLOW and painful to watch. Putting aside the facts that science and physics dictate (another planet in such proximity would create gravitational disruption destroying both \\"earths\\"). This is just a boring movie, no real special effects, no real story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! even 99 pennies!!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Not much I can add to the glowing reviews here, except to add that I think this album will also appeal to music fans who don't consider themselves to be heavy metal or hard rock fans. I was never a diehard UFO fan myself, but I heard \\"Strangers in the Night\\" as a double live vinyl album when it first came out in the late 70s, and I really liked it. A lot. I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane last year, so I ordered the CD and listened to it again to see if I still liked it as much. And I did. I was really surprised at how good this still sounds. I wouldn't even  call it metal; it's just good, very good, well played rock & roll with lots of punch, a bit of pop polish, and of course Michael Schenker's biting guitar runs. Play it loud, jump up and down on the sofa, do a few air guitar windmills; it's all good!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This flic was on sale so I thought \\"what the hey\\" for $1.99 what can I lose. This is a fantastic movie, a touching tale of the prejudice that existed in that era (and sadly still exists)in the \\"deep south\\". As a \\"New Yorker\\" (now transplanted in Georgia)I was only exposed to this once in my life, in 1962 (age 10)I traveled with an Aunt to Virginia and needed to use the boys room. There were 2 and not knowing local customs & laws I thought a \\"colored\\" bathroom would be more interesting than one that was plain \\"white\\". A local redneck dragged me out while I was still peeing and began cussing me outside. My Aunt ran up and began berating this ignorant person then explained to me the meaning of these hateful practices. This is a \\"MUST SEE\\" for all who do not remember and a great lesson for those too young. In short the best $1.99 I have spent in a long time!! A+++++
B000002LGA|5.0|This was a great, great Lou Reed album, one of his best ever. It didn't come out during the old \\"classic\\" Lou Reed era of Transformer and Walk on the Wild Side, but many years later, when Lou was a grizzled veteran of the rock and roll wars. I think it perhaps get overlooked because of that timing, and the lack of any hit singles, but that doesn't lessen the impact. \\"New York\\" presented a wise and all-knowing Lou Reed; a sage with poetic --- and funny ---lyrics, and a knack for still being able to write catchy songs. And he surrounded himself with a stellar band. These guys were tight. I saw him on tour the year this album came out and was awestruck by the performance. That tour, this album; rock and roll poetry.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I got this movie from Netflix because my boyfriend and I are fans of horror movies even though I usually get scared really easy.  Nothing about this movie scared me.  In fact, I found it to be stupid and wish I had never seen it.  I wouldn't waste my money on it.  If you are looking for a horror movie that really scares the pants off you, than this isn't it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so fun!it reminds me so much of Mario brothers I luv it! its challenging but that makes it 10x more fun
B004W2UBYW|5.0|To start I hate reading, I received my kindle for christmas and this was the second book I read.  I loved this book it did a good job of giving the reader a in depth look at Steve Jobs.  You want to know why apple is a good company? read this book.  You want to learn how to be a good boss? read this book.  I love documentary movies and this book blows them all out of the water.  There is no way any movie will be able to immolate this book.  Read this book
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Awesome...in the top 10 of my over 200+ anime's I own. Great Action, Well done characters, ...Little sexual \\"worlds ending afterall\\" Best take on a Zombie holocaust of any Movie.<br />Buy this ...it's on the money all the way. Hope for seson 2.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|The Bonus features aren't listed for this DVD - why not?  So here they are:<br />1)Deleted/Extended scenes<br />2)The Thing evolves - a good feature telling how they wanted to make a movie that stood out from the 1982 movie<br />3) Fire & Ice - a feature dealing with the special effects of the movie<br />4) Feature commentary with Director Matthijs van Heijningen and Producer Eric Newman.<br /><br />I won't add any further to the critique of the movie, everyone else has done that for you.  I will say that if you own the 1982 and 1950's original, then this is must for your collection.
B0073XORLU|5.0|This is Ian's best work since Roots to Branches. I had resigned myself to the notion that I would never again experience the exquisite pleasure of another new top drawer \\"Tull\\" album, but here it is. I've been onboard since 1969 and this is a very welcome gift from an old friend. Thank you, Ian!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This was a movie I really enjoyed. The opening scene is suspenseful and the performance by Brad Pitt is very good. I would watch this movie again!

B0058VW36U|5.0|Its awsome! Very addicting, very fun I downloaded it for my kindle fire and it does have all the updates, so worth the money
B004LROUW2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, my first one by Mr. Marukami. This novel shows why the Kindle is so great: normally I would never have purchased this book in the book store, but by reading a sample on my Kindle I was hooked. Anyway, this is a great novel. Intriguing characters and unique premise.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|at first I had some issues with my phone (the venue) but now it's working great and a pleasure to use. I love that j can be at any device or Pc and update my lists and it all synchs up.
0545265355|5.0|Just the book I was looking for; thrilling, adoreable, adventure, scheming, and more. I couldn't put it down and I'm so sad that its done. The epilogue was a little unnecessary but I still loved all the books. Highly reccomended!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I have to say this first: I didn't care much about Cuban. In fact he annoyed me with his attitude and his tendency to get fined by the  NBA. I really got this book out of sheer curiosity and openmindedness.<br />This book has given me a new appreciation of Mark Cuban I never thought I'd get. I was half-expecting an egocentric biography (à la Trump) but I derived from this book sound advice directly applicable to my life. The aspect of the book I truly enjoyed was how Mark delivers his stories coupled with his way of thinking: very directly and efficiently. Unlike many books from successful people out there, there was no particular moment I thought \\"Ok this guys is full of it\\".<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone curious about the thinking of successful people. You may not agree with all of the content, but you will likely appreciate the perspective it brings.
0307592731|5.0|I just finished reading \\"wild\\" and I absolutely loved it!  It was so suspenseful and compelling.  I really fell in love with Cheryl and her quest.  I laughed, cried and rooted for her throughout the entire book.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in an adventure!
B0073XORCY|5.0|Being a huge Jethro Tull fan, I was very excited about this, yet a little nervous. Thick as a Brick is one of my favorite albums of all time. And although this doesn't live up to the original, nothing really could. TAAB2 is, however, the best album I have heard in years. It is such a relief to finally have another album that you can put on and listen to the entirety without skipping any tracks. It has the Jethro Tull sound and feel, even without Martin Barre. If you didn't know anything about the band lineup, you would have no idea it wasn't a Tull album. Do yourself a favor and pick this album up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it could hav better games. but otherwise it is a really fun game

B0072GPQNG|2.0|Think Black Beauty without good character development and throw in a war.  Now you know the story of War Horse.  The emotional bonding between the main character and the horse was just not believable and at times corny.  Most of what happened in this film was very predictable. The whole way through you know how it will all end.  Have you ever seen the film where Lassie gets lost, switches owners a few times and ends up in a war?  So have the people that made this film.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great buy, at a very good price.  The three books in the series are well written, and have excellent continuity from one book to the other.  Really made me want to see the movie.  The story kept you rooting for Katniss, and to a lesser extent for Peeta.  Got to really hate the President and cheered when he met his demise.  Made me wonder if they would continue the series.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love this show. I can watch it over again. I hope they don't mess up the writing of this show. I love when I find a good series like The Shield, Heroes and No Ordinary Family which isn't on anymore. Love the casting of Revenge. MUST SEE.

B00729GQ0A|1.0|Honestly who in their right mind would write a YA book about occults? Does this author even know that younger tweens might read this book? That they might get bad ideas? Just so stupid.<br /><br />Besides that, this book was boring as twilight(huge diss right there since absolutely nothing happened in twilight!) Put a dumb girl in the picture and *paranormal * aspects and Bam! You have a crappy not one of a kind YA book. There's nothing special in the forever girl.  Nothing new at all. My advice for the author is: stop bashing reviewers (not everyone ail love your so called book). And to maybe actually not copyright other books. Come up with something great and fresh on your own. Maybe then people will actually enjoy the book.
B000W799NU|5.0|Great to watch the \\"classics\\" with my little sister- we've been reading the books and watching the corresponding movies at the end of each, and I panicked when I realized we didn't own this one!<br /><br /> Nicely packaged, pristine condition- No complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it is a wonderful family film- acting is adorable and genuine, sets lustrous, soundtrack magical. One of the best-paced of all the movies.

B007H7XJD4|2.0|A bit slow and the plot wasn't very interesting. Whenever the gods appeared it was more exciting; however, those moments were very very few and far between.<br />The movie lacks any real emotion and comes across as your average film with lazy writing.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|if this had more of the capabilities of the ipad's noteshelf it would be 5 stars. needs more options and choices.

1594203334|5.0|Pamela Druckerman is hilarious. Have you heard the one about delivering twins at a public hospital in Paris? The one about chasing your sperm donor, oops, husband around Europe by train to hit your fertility just right? The one about your infant's repeating the French she's heard at the creche, as though she was wearing a wire and you're downloading it every night? If all this doesn't sound so funny you'll fall off your chair, you haven't read this book.<br /><br />But wait. There's much more. I had wondered how those well-behaved tots could sit quietly with their parents in restaurants in France. Thanks, Pamela Druckerman, for explaining it all. So it helps to talk to children like rational beings from the start and teach them to wait and delay gratification! So it helps to develop babies' palates in the creche, which is not like a kibbutz, after all.<br /><br />This book isn't just \\"amusante,\\" it is also \\"sage.\\"
0307719219|5.0|This book is maybe an oversimplified answer to the question of Why Nations Fail but the best book written on the subject so far. Also these Acemoglu and Robinson clearly state this is an oversimplification: \\"Our choice was motivated not by a naïve belief that such a theory could explain everything, but by the belief that a theory should enable us to focus on the parallels, sometimes at the expense of abstracting from many interesting details\\".<br /><br />I think Acemoglu and Robinson are right when claiming inclusive institutions is what explains the success of the Nations and extractive institutions explain the fail. Not 100% ofcourse.<br /><br />I admit some details irritates me a lot.<br /><br />1. Emphasizing over and over again the importance of centralization as a necessary (even if ofcourse not sufficient) condition for the arise of inclusive institutions they forget totally to tell about the bottom-up spontaneous nature of the institutional change in the Chinese country side which in reality was the first step towards a Chinese market economy. John McMillanin [[ASIN:0393323714 Reinventing the Bazaar: A Natural History of Markets]] tells:<br /><br />\\"China's agriculture switched from collective to individual production in the late 1970s. The marketization of agriculture lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of dire poverty. It was the biggest antipoverty program the world has ever seen....<br /><br />Desperation had hit the farmers of Xiaogang village in China's Anhui province by 1978. The commune on which they worked collectively was dysfunctional. Known as the granary of China, Anhui contains some of the nation's most fertile land. But Xiaogang's twenty families were not producing enough rice to feed themselves. They had been reduced to relying on begging in other regions. In years of unfavorable weather they starved. Fearful of being arrested, the villagers met secretly and agreed to parcel out the communal land among themselves. They made a three-part resolution. First, as they were flouting government policy, the contracting of land to individual households was to be kept strictly secret; it was not to be divulged to any outsider. Second, they would continue to deliver the stipulated amount of rice taxes to the state. Third, if any of them were jailed, the others would raise their children until they were eighteen years old. They signed the pact with their thumbprints. A rapid turnaround followed. The farmers of Xiaogang immediately became more productive. \\"Now is different from the past,\\" one said. \\"We work for ourselves.\\" Working their own plots of land, they could see a direct link between their effort and their rewards. Any of their output beyond what they owed the state they now retained to use for themselves or to sell. The amount of land planted in rice nearly doubled in one year, and the village began producing a rice surplus. As a farmer said, \\"You can't be lazy when you work for your family and yourself...<br /><br />Provincial Communist Party officials visited the village and gave their blessings. Then a high-level Beijing official traveled to Xiaogang and neighboring villages to study the effects of individual farming. His report, which concluded that individual farming increased output and improved living standards, became influential when it was circulated among the national leaders. At a Communist Party conference in 1982, four years after the Xiaogang villagers' meeting, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping endorsed the reforms. In 1983 the central government formally proclaimed individual farming to be consistent with the socialist economy and therefore permissible. By 1984, just six years after Xiaogang started the movement, there were no communes left....)\\"<br /><br />2. A second issue which irritates me is when they tell us about the success story of Botswana they again forget to tell about the other side of the story:<br /><br />The national product of Botswana has - much thanks to theinclusive institutions - reached the level of some East European success countries like Estonia, but the Life Expectancy has collapsed. The Life expectancy is as low as 35 years according to World Bank figures - having been 64 years only in 1990.<br /><br />This double development is nicely explained by the racialist Lynn-Vanhanen theory. Vanhanen and Lynn claim: National IQ explains some 50% of variation in GDP between nations and also variation in many other measures of Quality of Life.  But for Life Expectancy National IQ explains even more than 50%: According to \\"[[ASIN:1593680252 IQ and Global Inequality]]\\" by Lynn and Vanhanen National IQ explains 60-70 % of the variation in Life Expectancy between nations. London School of Economics sociologist Satori Kanazawa has shown controlling of IQ makes factors like GDP to explain nothing of the variance in Life Expectancy.<br /><br />Thus even if inclusive institutions make Botswana to prosper, Life Expetancy is low, fully in accordance with Lynn and Vanhanen. The ultimate explanation for low Life-expectancy is the low National IQ. The proximate explanation is AIDS.<br /><br />But what then explains the high rates of AIDS in Africa? According to World Health Organisation it is very much probable HIV will never reach high rates outside Africa. For many years WHO speculated on a risk for AIDS epidemy in India, Russia or what ever country. The risk was never materialised. And now even WHO admits the risk will probably never materialise. How then does WHO explain the lack of AIDS epidemy outside Africa ? The explanation WHO is giving is the high rate of parallel sexual relationships in Africa - high compared to other geographical areas. In other words married African men and women are frequently having unprotected extramarital sex.<br /><br />Low control of sex drive and disability to use condoms by low IQ people is probably the mechanism how low IQ is causing the low Life-Expectancy in case of Botswana.nclusive institutions - reached the level of some East European success countries like Estonia, but the Life Expectancy has collapsed.

1439153663|5.0|This is my first review of any Book I have read, because I loved this book so much, I could not put it down and did not want it to end. I read the reviews several times before purchasing as I did not want to pay that amount for a Kindle Book. I am so glad I did!!!!<br />I wish the writer had not ended the Kitchen House as she did as I would of loved to have seen a sequel to show how Levinia and Belle continued on through life. I was also surprised that this is the first antebellum book I have read that mentions the fact that the Irish were also Indentured Servants as well as German and Scottish were, going back to The Colonial Days.<br />To answer one writers comment as to what baby Henry died from, I believe Baby Henry died of Sickle Cell Disease. Swollen hands and feet are some of the first things you might notice if your baby has Sickle Cell Disease, this is a disease known in only the Black Race.<br />All in all I loved the way the writer wrote out the characters  descriptions' and could vision the Dresses of the day and could almost smell the dishes that Mama made. I am going to try the recipe at the end of the book for Molasses Cake that the writer includes.<br />Buy this book you will not be disappointed.<br />Thank you,<br />Gail<br />A New England Yankee !!!
0143034901|5.0|The only thing I can say about this book is that once done reading it....I read it again.  The writing is so beautiful and the story just floats so easily along.  I am sure I will read this book again and again.
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|While i thought this movie couldve been better , still it wasnt bad for the money. It doesnt live up to the shrek standards but all in all a good film and i was glad i saw it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This story is for me a combination os laughter, tears, hope, history and love.  I learned more about what I already knew about these times of slavery and plantations and continue to be facinated by this era.  The strength and hope the black people of this time had adn the color blindness many white people had makes this story and many others a favorite of mine.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I liked this movie. I liked the cast and the characters alike and found the whole plot amusing. It was 3.99 well spent.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|For all the positive reviews the critics gave this movie, it sure came out unintelligible, drawn out, and pointless. It's one of those movies that starts out and you think to yourself, \\"Alright I'll understand this in less than ten minutes\\"...but after an hour and a half of sitting in the theater, you feel the exact same way.<br /><br />I get this movie is supposed to be \\"smart\\", but if it excludes everyone from enjoying it, what point does it serve? Save your money, and go watch something intelligent AND accessible.
B0076NKNLA|3.0|I wanted to like this movie more than i did. It was just, boring. MM had a facinating life and this part of it was just slow boring and needy. Sorry 3 stars is all i can give.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|This is one of the most life changing books I have read. As an introvert, it was hard not to imagine that there is something inherently wrong with me that I needed to change. The book has shown me where I am different, my strengths, and how i can work on the  shortfalls of introversion to my advantage.<br /><br />The little paragraph below jumped from the pages and had such an impact on me. I would call it redemptive!I can almost think the little boy that I was feels better about himself now, as if the me now can travel through time and re-assure him that the future was (is) not that grim and harsh after all, and for all the worries, assure him it turned out (will turn out) alright.<br /><br />David still remembers acutely what it was like to be his nine-year-old self. \\"I feel like I'm in touch with that person today,\\" he says. \\"Whenever I'm doing something that I think is cool, like if I'm in New York City in a room full of people, interviewing Alicia Keys or something, I send a message back to that person and let him know that everything turned out OK. I feel like when I was nine, I was receiving that signal from the future, which is one of the things that gave me the strength to hang in there. I was able to create this loop between who I am now and who I was then.\\"<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book to all introverts
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|The most in depth fantasy world in 50 years.  Martin and Tolkien will be compared to each other for the next generation for the depth of the worlds they create.  Game of Thrones on HBO has to be one of the best adaptations of a novel in recent years (as LoR was).  It is obvious the HBO producers/ directors are putting a lot of effort to be faithful to the source material.  Best show on television today.

0765356139|3.0|<Warning:  Do NOT read this review if you have not read the first novel.  There are spoilers.><br /><br />This is the second installment of Sanderson's Mistborn Trilogy.  To briefly summarize, Vin and the crew have successfully overthrown the Lord Ruler.  She and Elend are now attempting to rebuild a society out of the ruins of the The Final Empire.<br /><br />There are two primary struggles in this novel.  The first, centered around Elend, has to do with his efforts at finding himself as a leader and being an effective ruler while the town is surrounded by enemy armies without compromising his political ideology.  In many ways, Elend is more of an intellectual than a politician, and he has a hard time maintaining a grip on those who are under him. Meanwhile, there are three enemy armies at Luthadel's doorstep that he has to contend with.  The second struggle, centered around Vin, has to do with her relationship with Elend, her search for who she is, and the growing animosity between her and the mists.<br /><br />Like the first novel, I gave this one a rating of 3 stars.  There are a few reasons for this:<br /><br />The progression of the story was a bit..slow.  I can appreciate a novel that is slow for the sake of gaining information that is necessary for understanding the story completely, but I didn't feel like there was any..benefit to the slowness.  For literally 3/4 of the book, the city is under siege and everyone is running around trying to figure out what to do.  The last fourth of the book is decent, but still, not worth the wait in my opinion.<br /><br />With the exception of Vin and Elend, the characters are still a bit boring and predictable.  Vin is slowly maturing, learning to trust people, and as stubborn as ever.  Elend is a bit awkward, has a kind heart, and is a stereotypical academic.  Sazed is a bit more developed than the rest, but not by a lot.  Ham, Breeze, Clubs, Spook, and the rest of the crew are all still pretty cliche.  This may not be much of an issue for those who read for plot.  I, however, read mainly for world building and character development, so this is a huge turn off for me.<br /><br />I will say, however, that Sanderson's story is not too conventional.  It doesn't follow a Tolkien format, which is refreshing.  Also, as I mentioned in my review of book 1, the magic system is unique and creative!<br /><br />Still overall, I wasn't impressed with this work.  I have yet to finish the final book because, while it is definitely better than the first two novels, it is still a bit boring.  Sanderson uses a lot of the same..plot developing devices in the third book that he uses in the first.  Though, I will say, the character development does improve slightly.  I try not to badger him too much about this because I know that developing well rounded, believably, interesting characters is one of the hardest parts of writing a story.<br /><br />So yeah, there is my input.

As stated in other reviews it was a bit difficult to pick up and continue reading. However, I did read the entire book hoping it was going to get better. If you are a new to romance novels then this is a book for you. I found this book took to long to say nothing. It did not leave me wanting to read the next book in the series in order to see how things are going to go with the young rich millionaire who is taken by the once virgin college grad. It was quite boring and did not give anything back to the reader but frustration. However, I will say I did learn new words I constantly was using my thesaurus. I prefer my erotica books.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|first of all the free trial kinda screws you over.  Also prepare for the audio to not follow the video.  and then if you try to mess with the settings it'll drive your kindle insane and cause the entire device to crash.  Destroy this app before it destroys your device
0345803485|1.0|This is my first review. Usually I just rate the books I read. But, this book was so bad that I had to warn other readers. The writing is so poor that I can't believe that anyone would buy this except for the hype. Which was tremendous and why I gave it a try. The main female character is so annoying that it was all I could do to get through the first chapter. The story is typical with no originality what so ever. The book was one of the biggest wastes of my time and I average the reading of 30+ books a month. I haven't done the research, but I am going to assume that this book is self-published. If not, the publisher should be boycotted. Some people should hit the writers forums and have other writers crit the book before putting it out there for others to read. From the beginning, there was no hook to grab the reader and for every poorly written word after that, it got worse. I want the 3 hours of my life back that I wasted reading this garbage.  I wish negative stars could be given.

0345803485|5.0|This book is amazing, crazy, intense, hot, entrancing, and the list goes on. I ate this book up and just couldn't stop reading it.  I stayed up entirely too late finishing it (the day after it arrived in the mail) and it was completely worth the exhaustion the next day at work.  I love Ana.  She is amazing and a pilar of \\"normal\\" (whatever normal is) for me in the story.  Christian can be very overwhelming and frankly, a little frightening.  But, I found myself feeling a little like Ana does.  I was completely entranced by him.  While he is dark (the very definition of dark, in my opinion) he is also sweet, sad, and wounded.  His instantious mood changes from dark to playful and vice versa sadden me.  I found myself feeling desperate to know what happened to him, why he won't let Ana touch him (particularly his chest), and a little angry at whoever was responsible for making him the way he was.  I love that Ana completly takes him off guard.  From the very beginning of their relationship, she has him doing things he never did before.  She challenges him and he has no idea what to do about it.  He is desperately trying to control her & she is fighting with her desire to let him and that little voice in her head that tells her to stand her ground.  I can't wait to read the other two books. I have been nosing around the internet and apparently there are talks to this triology being making it onto the big screen.  I am seriously curious how this will be done, but really excited about the pssobility.<br /><br />Fair warning to all you would be readers:  There is lots and lots and LOTS of sex.  Crazy sex.  Lots of it.  Did I mention lots of sex?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Judging by the amount of reviews this book already has, I don`t think you need mine (but mostly because typing on the A.K.3 drives me mad). So I just decided to say that The Hunger Games are amazing and are hard to put down. I would reccomend for teens and up. Younger readers, don't read it 'cos you'll get scared.
0345803485|5.0|The backlash to this book has been pretty amusing. I read all three books in one week. I absolutely loved them because I took them for what they are - A really great love story with some incredibly hot / erotic sex scenes. No it is not a literary masterpiece, but it does not have to be. Just like not all movies have to be academy award winners, not all books have to win the Pulitzer prize. Sometimes it is wonderful to just read a book and get lost in the story. This trilogy was my obsession and I got totally lost in them, so much that I am currently reading them again. The second book is actually my favorite, but loved all three. I would recommend reading them with an open mind and enjoy the romance, love and sex!

1416550550|1.0|On the enthusiastic recommendation of a friend, I bought(ordered from Amazon) and read this book.  I was sucked into the story after the frst few pages.  The author wove a wonderful tale with a captivating mystery that was not solved until the last pages.  The characters were believably real----the story covers three generations and was set in Australia and England.  Loved this book.

0307477479|5.0|This is a wonderfully satisfying book.  I was surprised at the second chapter that the narrative is non-sequential and that the narrator changes, but I found this delightful.  I loved that it explored the questions of \\"whatever happened to\\" and \\"where did that come from.\\"  The book is non-linear, but it pulls together by the end to create a complete story.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Deep down, I believe that things will settle in the right place given enough time.  So, I'm not the least bit worried that JOHN CARTER will find its audience because it's a diverting adventure that pours genuine imagination all over your stinking head.  We just have to wait out the haters that have taken to bashing this film.<br /><br />Yes, the premise of JOHN CARTER is utterly ridiculous- that a diverse group of beings live on Mars, or Barsoom as the locals call it, fighting ancient rivalries and draining their world of life in the process. And yet, the premise is what makes this movie so charming to me- that you could look up at a dot in the night's sky and imagine all kinds of heroism and exotic derring-do.  You're not bound by what you know with this kind of film. Similar to how INGLORIOUS BASTERDS threw out your knowledge of World War II, JOHN CARTER offers the same kind of \\"no strings attached\\" storytelling. A human can walk on this Mars- he can actually walk and run rather well because of the difference in gravity. And his strength can make a human a formidable warrior in this environment.<br /><br />Enter Captain John Carter, formerly of the Confederate Army.  Drifting through the Arizona territory desperately searching for gold to heal the many losses he's suffered (his wife and child dead from the war), John Carter is a man without purpose. In stumbling upon a means to travel to Mars, Carter is given the chance to become a hero for a Martian princess who seeks to stop her planet's demise at the hands of some serious villainy.  Naturally, John Carter and the princess, Dejah Thoris, hit it off.<br /><br />Carter also forms an alliance with a truly alien character-- Tars Tarkas, the leader of the Tharks.  The Tharks are everything the Gungans should have been in STAR WARS: EPISODE  I. And Tars is no Jar Jar; this alien has genuine charisma.<br /><br />JOHN CARTER is a completely satisfying adventure. The film provides unpretentious escapism; there is no needto analyze elements of the story or setting. This isn't science fiction, we are not supposed to know how this universe functions. JOHN CARTER is a movie where you root for the good guys and hope the girl gets her man. Luckily, the actors are all charming and the action is very easy to follow, unlike a lot of contemporary CG-driven films.<br /><br />This movie will remind you of how you enjoyed films as a kid- without insulting your intelligence. It's an emotionally sincere and thrilling film.
0440246008|4.0|Lee Child's \\"The Hard Way\\" was too hard for me to believe though it was a worthwhile, entertaining read.<br /><br />Jack Reacher must have smelled pretty rank after all that walking around in New York City without ever changing clothes. I'm surprised the smell of him didn't get him thrown out of restaurants.<br /><br />I also don't believe that anyone, at any time, knows to the minute what time it is because of some special internal clock.<br /><br />And I don't believe that a former criminal investigator for the military police or his FBI sidekick would fail to even consider having the observation post dusted for fingerprints to identify the occupant.<br /><br />But I should probably read some of his other books, particularly the ones which won awards, before passing final judgment.<br /><br />-30-<br />John H.

B004EPYZV2|4.0|People who call this contrived totally miss the point of the film and the whole idea. Hint: the clue is in the title! This film is FUN from top to bottom, not to mention self-aware (the failing gadgetry). It has its cake and eats it too - right down to the badguy looney who is also apparently an olympic level sprinter who can outrun the highly-trained Hunt/Cruise! All that matters is the hijinks and the adrenaline. I loved it. Brad Bird hasn't missed yet - from his \\"Family Dog\\" episode of Amazing Stories (and The Simpsons eps) and charming screenplay for batteries Not Included, to Iron Giant and Ratatouille & The Incredibles.<br /><br />But the Amazon review - Number THREE is the low point? Did you even SEE Number Two?!<br /><br />At least this one remembers the campy Bond hijinks. Not a Cruise fan although I do enjoy him in roles that utilise his arrogance, and likewise MI:4 uses his manic tenacity to fantastic effect.<br /><br />I'm getting this fancydisc the second it hits!
B007MJSYF0|5.0|This review is from my 13 year old daughter...<br /><br />Battle Royale (B.R.) was a really good movie. I saw The Hunger Games (H.G) 2 weeks ago. While watching Battle Royale, I noticed some similarities between The Hunger Games and Battle Royale. At first, I thought B.R. copied H.G. story line. I did some research and saw that B.R. book came out in 1999 and B.R. movie came out in 2000.<br />When I found that out, I thought Suzanne Collins (author of H.G.) copied B.R.<br /><br />To the movie...<br /><br />B.R. was a very good movie. Better than H.G.  B.R. had a good storyline, good action, fast-paced movie. H.G. was good as well. After seeing B.R., I felt H.G. copied B.R. storyline. Storyline: Group of kids (high-school age) are forced by the government to kill each other. In the end of B.R. 2 victors emerged despite the rule that said only 1 victor can win. In the end of H.G., same ending.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay, let's be honest here. This book is all about the hype. I went in knowing that, and you know what? I'm totally fine with it. No, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is not a great book. It probably cannot even really be classified as a good book. But it's entertaining, and I quite enjoyed it. I couldn't put the darn thing down, and stayed awake long past 1 a.m. for the past two nights reading it.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the draw for me was not the sex. I don't read erotic/romance novels so I don't have anything to compare this book to, but I was much more interested in the actual storyline and the two main characters: Anastasia, a recent college graduate who meets the stunningly handsome Christian Grey, a man several years older than her who also happens to be a billionaire. (Oh yeah, and he's also hardcore into BDSM.) Poor Ana falls head-over-heels for this guy, but unfortunately for her, she has zero previous sexual experience and the whole idea of being a submissive partner kind of rubs her the wrong way, to say the least. The whole book (which was written as \\"Twilight\\" fan fic, a fact that in itself is quite hilarious) deals with Ana dealing with her deep feelings for Christian and her reluctance to become his sex slave.<br /><br />The sex scenes themselves are quite frequent and unbelievably graphic (we are talking hardcore porn here). Still, the characters are really what held my interest throughout, and they are the reason why I will read the second and third installments of the trilogy. I have no idea where the author is going with this relationship and what Christian's deal is, and I am excited to find out.<br /><br />There are definitely some annoying things about the book itself. The writing, while nothing great, still blows Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" books out of the water. (I think the \\"Twilight\\" novels  have to be the most poorly written books in history...but, just like \\"Fifty Shades,\\" it was the characters and the story that sucked me into those as well.) I get annoyed with Ana's low self-esteem issues and her constant use of the expression \\"Oh my!\\" whenever she is being, um, pleasured. Still, as this is fan fic, you really can't fault the author with these characterizations, as she's only mimicking Meyer. Finally, the scenes that focus around feminine hygiene are gross and unnecessary. There is nothing \\"hot\\" about any of that! Luckily those scenes were few and far between.<br /><br />Anyway, I think the book is definitely worth reading if you are, a.) not a prude, and b.) looking for something mindlessly entertaining to read which does not in any way pose as a book that has any literary worth whatsoever. Accept \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" for what it is: a popular read that everyone will be talking about this summer. Enjoy it!ell.)

So this is more about practical application of the law of attraction.  Even just to be more conscious of being grateful lifts your energy and I am enjoying doing the exercises.  Still on day 5, with the rest of the month to go, but I do recommend this book!
1451673442|5.0|Another life changing book from Rhonda Byrne! It's an easy, fun, heartwarming read. My favorite aspect of the book is the daily practices; performing and completing the practices gave me an overwhelming sense of gratitude for my life. Now I realize that's a bold statement, but the practices ask that you to take a look at yourself and your life in a very encouraging way. Please note that the daily practices are short activities that are long on rewards. Reading and participating in The Magic enabled me to see ALL that I have to be grateful for, it's been an amazing experience. I'm so glad that I took this journey. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Rhonda Byrne!

B000286SCO|5.0|this is a great video. i am a relatively new fan, about 6-7 years. it was fun to see the bad in the earlier years<br />and to hear the earlier material in a live performance. one thing about DT is that they try to mix up the material so you have a wide variety of songs among the various dvds instead of the same songs over and over. this double disc dvd is also cool when you turn on the band commentary. they actually sat there and watched the both discs over a two day period and gave some insights into the creative aspects as well as some inside info about their gear and previous band members. it makes me wish i had been a fan back then.
B00028HBKM|5.0|&#34;And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.&#34; Rev. 17:7  Mel Gibson uses film making to its utmost potential in this most graphic portrayal of Jesus' passion.  This film is an artist's rendering of historical events through a medium where almost anything is possible.  Did he go too far?  The superficial rendering of the story of the Passion of Christ Jesus is bound to draw sharp criticisms.  It's when you dig beneath the surface that you find great riches.  The first time I saw this movie was by accident, I never meant to see it--too much hype, I thought.  I came across it on TV and thought it was a foreign film; then it dawned on me I was watching Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ.  Though I've prayed the sorrowful mysteries many times, my puny imagination could not have evoked such images as this film portrays.  It brought to my mind the real gravity of our Lord's suffering that we all take sin so lightly and we shouldn't.  That's what Mel is saying in this great work of art.  Art, you say?  Great art.  I realized it from my first viewing.  The story is true to the Gospels, the additions are from the visions of Ann Catherine Emmerich and Mel Gibson's use of poetic license, and he works the imagery to great effect.  I instantly recognized that certain of the graphic aspects of the film are inspired by what I always thought were ghastly paintings of Jesus on the Cross that you see so much in Italy, and the book of Revelation--&#34;And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.&#34; Rev. 17:6.  For instance, in the whipping scene, which garnered so much of the criticism for its violence, you see those images transposed deftly--the androgynous-looking gaunt woman in the black veil with her off-spring (which is corruption), the soldiers drunk at the sight of the blood they draw from the innocent body of Christ with their instruments of torture, he it was that crushed the head of the snake in the Garden--&#34;The infernal serpent . . . whose guile, stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived the Mother of Mankind&#34; (Milton, Paradise Lost).  And so you are also moved by the juxtaposition of the sweet scenes of Jesus' life and the brutal slaying of this most innocent of men, and you wonder about the gaunt woman threading her way through the crowd as she watches events unfold with fixed eyes of cold fascination.  Because this film IS so graphic I do not watch it more than twice a year for fear of becoming jaded, but each time I do I'm struck again and my heart is broken by this man of sorrows, &#34;[D]espised and rejected of men . . . and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.&#34; Isaiah 53:2-4.

0143119680|2.0|Having just finished Night Circus I shared with a few co-workers how much I loved the book. Based on my praise a co-worker recommended the Discovery of Witches. On a whim I bought it without reading reviews or a synopsis, which I usually do. For me, this purchase was a terrible mistake.<br /><br />By my definition this is simply a blouse buster wrapper in vampires' and witches' clothing. I can deal with mystical, ghostly and unanswered eeriness of some stories and books, but vampires and witches? No. The author's sickeningly sweet sentiments over perfection in a vampire, his home, his speech...in fact the over laudatory machinations about any male, be he human, vampire or creature of another kind made me ill. Character stories without the heavy breathing, being swept off one's feet suit me better.<br /><br />Even I like a good love story every once and awhile, but this I could not finish. Never again will I buy a book solely on someone's recommendation. And for the record, Night Circus and Discovery of Witches have very little in common.

I learned a LOT of stuff, some of it mind shaking.  It is backed by scientific research, and therefore with my training background, more believable.  Also showed that I need to take a deeper, more questioning, look at the science in published studies (especially the ones reviewed on the news). When I mention the book, I have found many others (especially those who have experienced cancer) have read the book.  Most shocking was that milk may not do a body good, and that casein may have a strong correlation with cancer.  Good solid reliable book.

0871404133|3.0|In \\"Social Conquest,\\" Wilson helps articulate and spread a few sober insights concerning the human condition. That's good. We must somehow digest such self-observations, individually, collectively, and pan-culturally, to the point where we actually are empowered by the resulting self-knowledge to \\"do something about ourselves.\\" Scientific self-knowledge, unsettling and widely understood, seems the only hope for mitigating and ultimately halting the escalating human-caused calamities faced by our own adolescent and very tenuous civilizations, and by the earthly biosphere that supports us and so many other living wonders.<br /><br />However, Wilson's \\"revolutionary\\" views on how we evolved to our current condition are highly suspect. This matters: not accurately understanding the basis of our condition in terms of its historical (evolutionary) causes will lessen our ability to navigate toward any real solutions. We cannot afford it.<br /><br />Therefore, anyone reading this book who is interested in its purported \\"revolutionary\\" scientific content, specifically, Wilson's claims that we are better off abandoning William Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory as an important basis for understanding the design of the human psyche, should have easy access to the responses of Dr. Wilson's peers. So, here you go. There are five pieces in the journal Nature, collected under the heading, \\"Brief Communications Arising,\\"<br /><br />Nature v471, issue 7339, pp. E1-E9 (24 March 2011).<br /><br />These articles are brief and very readable. These pages also include a response by Wilson and his coauthors that, as far as I can see, just ignores all the specific criticisms.<br /><br />Nature Publishing Group should make the full text of these comments freely available to the public in electronic form, via Nature.com, in my opinion. (I would put up links to the full pdf's myself, but Amazon would probably have to tear them down due to the copyright violation. My server would probably crash too.)<br /><br />Additional evaluations of Wilson's argument (actually, that of Nowak, Tarnita, and Wilson, 2010, Nature 466, 1057-1062, plus much \\"Supplementary Information\\") were also published in Nature:<br /><br />Nature v467, issue 7316, pp. 653-655 (7 October 2010);<br /><br />Nature v467, issue 7316, p. 661 (7 October 2010, several short pieces of correspondence on this page);<br /><br />Nature v471, issue 7338, pp. 294-295 (17 March 2011).<br /><br />I tried putting up the direct Nature.com URL's to all this, but Amazon does not allow external links.<br /><br />ADDED 06-23-2014: Another excellent and accessible read debunking Wilson's bid to dump inclusive fitness theory:<br />Bourke, A.F.G. (2011) The validity and value of inclusive fitness theory. Proceedings of the Royal Society B, v.278, pp. 3313-3320. I will try to put a direct link to it in a comment immediately below this review. If that does not work, email me for a pdf.<br /><br />In addition, you easily can get hold of the full text of this article from the open access journal Evolutionary Psychology: Evolutionary Psychology 10(1): 45-49, by Michael E. Price, 2012. Go to epjournal dot net on your browser. It is a very readable review of a recent book by Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis which Wilson cites in support of his group selection thesis.<br /><br />Wilson demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the profoundly altruistic sentiments and behaviors individual selection for inclusive fitness maximization can cause to evolve in places where he implies that you need a genetic group selection process to obtain such traits.<br /><br />Moreover, the notion that individuals sudden become \\"robotic\\" when they evolve traits designed for indirect reproduction, such as programs to stay home and raise siblings or other relatives instead of their own offspring, makes absolutely no sense. Such individuals are no more robotic and no more an extension of their parent's phenotype, than individuals unconsciously bound by programs designed to accomplish direct reproduction via their own offspring, which by the way are grandchildren for their parents.<br /><br />For an delightfully enlightening and thorough \\"detox\\" after exposure to Wilson's theoretical..., uhh..., mess, or just for a truly modern, professional treatment of social evolution, I highly recommend Andrew F.G. Bourke's (2011) [[ASIN:0199231168 Principles of Social Evolution (Oxford Series in Ecology and Evolution)]]. Bourke's book is succinct, lucid, and clearly shows the immense, still under-appreciated (!) utility of inclusive fitness theory in explaining cooperation, altruism, selfishness, and spite across all biological levels of organization - the six fundamental kinds of \\"individuals\\" on earth, including eusocial societies.<br /><br />Added 4/29/2014: Also be on the lookout for a special edition of the top journal \\"Animal Behaviour\\" (which, appropriately, occasionally publishes work on humans) devoted to the grand utility of kin selection and inclusive fitness for understanding social life and other aspects of behavior. Contact me via email, and I can send you the first chapter of this promising edition on the probable usefulness of inclusive fitness theory for understanding the evolution of religiosity, a major research and teaching interest of my own.<br /><br />Whatever his motivations, Wilson clearly wishes to create some turbulence in the profession, which is always good in science. However, the general public must be helped to access perspectives that conflict with Wilson's and to appreciate more fully the hard work and genius of biologists other than himself. Wilson now seems content, if not happy, to dismiss them all, as on the Charlie Rose interview, as all being \\"stuck in a box,\\" but without explaining the very high hurdles his own ideas about human evolution have to clear to be taken seriously. It is revealing that Wilson barely mentions complex (i.e., multi-partner, multi-currency) contractual reciprocity, the real basis for cooperative human social life, as an easy source of standard individual / kin selection for deeply altruistic impulses and actions (e.g, see a classic work by Richard Alexander (1987, reprinted 2009) [[ASIN:0202011747 The Biology of Moral Systems (Foundations of Human Behavior)]]). If Wilson did so, readers would be likely to see for themselves that there is not a single human experience or behavior mentioned in \\"Conquest\\" that needs an onerous group selectionist explanation.<br /><br />Charlie Rose, whom I've watched quasi-religiously for years, except when he has those sports people on, did a terrible job interviewing Wilson several days ago concerning this book's main idea. The adoration quotient was just way too high. Rose should have other practicing evolutionary biologists on his program to provide a balanced perspective on this \\"revolution,\\" the general topic of the evolution of altruism, and to highlight the wonderful contributions of other key scientists to, what is aptly termed, \\"The Second Darwinian Revolution\\" of the 1960's and 70's. That's when naturalists and organismal biologists en masse finally began to deeply understand Darwin's ideas and their heavy awesome implications. Wilson certainly wasted no effort in the Charlie Rose interview, or in the current book, to mention them or accurately characterize their great labors. For example, William Hamilton, who of course Wilson has to mention a lot, was as great and passionate a naturalist as Wilson, not some ecologically naive theoretician. Hamilton understood natural selection in all respects. Moreover, Hamilton did not stop developing inclusive fitness theory with his 1964 papers, as reading or listening to Wilson might lead one to believe; get hold of [[ASIN:0716745305 Narrow Roads of Gene Land: The Collected Papers of W. D. Hamilton Volume 1: Evolution of Social Behaviour (Narrow Roads of Gene Land Vol. 1)]].\\" Others, far more so than Wilson, who actually were responsible for the core ideas that gave us the aforementioned revolution of the 60's and 70's, all of whom Wilson sees fit to completely or largely ignore - one has to, with sadness, wonder why - include George Williams, George Price, Robert Trivers, John Maynard-Smith, and Richard Alexander, not to mention a large group of theoretically savvy ace empiricists.<br /><br />Wilson should be using his not wholly undeserved position as one of the most popular and socially powerful organismal biologists on earth to make the public MORE aware of these human treasures.

I cant believe we have to wait until Fall for another episode.  My wife and I watched the first season in three nights after we stumbled on the series.  That is considerable since we never have time to watch TV.  If you're not sold, just watch the first episode and you will be hooked.  Guaranteed
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this plays smoothly with vibrant colors and graphics. a nice little game. definetly going to keep track of future games from this developer
B0069UV0LS|4.0|There is something about watching this very dark, brutal, intense, deeply sad, and yet profoundly compelling movie that seeps into the psyche, making future night walks rather fearsome. Paddy Considine who can bring us such warmly loveable characters on the screen as an actor here write and directs a story that pleads for us to look at just how low people can go - and still survive. It is shocking to watch but once the film begins the power of the story and the brilliance of the actors who bring it to life it is impossible to pause for breath.<br /><br />Joseph (Peter Mullan) is a grizzled, isolated, drunk widower whose anger at the world is so close to the surface that he lashes out at the slightest provocation - even to the point of brutally killing his own beloved dog at the opening of the film - a fact that makes the audience loathe him form the start. He lives alone, occasionally visits his only friend who is dying from cancer, and ha a connection with a kid across form his flat, a young boy Sam (Sammuel Bottomley) who is forced to sit out on the sidewalk while his mother (Sian Breckin) cavorts with her current boyfriend (Paul Popplewell) who keeps his pitbull dog close by. In a matter of a few days Joseph has not only beaten his dog to death, but he has also crushed the windows of the Paskistani bank where he abuses the owners, and in a pub pool hall he severely beats three mouthy boys who taunt him.<br /><br />Having no place to hide Joseph walks into a charity second hand store run by Hannah (Olivia Colman),a seemingly evangelical church woman who takes pity on Joseph and prays for him despite the fact that Joseph is atheistic. As the story unfolds we discover that Hannah is also a profoundly sad woman, her smarmy husband James (Edie Marsan) is abusive: Hannah is afraid of him and turns to drinking to escape her loathing of James. James spies Hannah with Joseph, threatens her, and rapes her, urinates on her, and destroys her organs with broken glass so that she is sterile.  Hannah attempts to leave James, gets drunk, is beaten more, and finally ends up with Joseph as her only friend and Gilead. When Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence, inflicted on self or by others, events become tense and suspenseful, and desperate though the characters are, we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Once the playing field is even between Joseph and Hannah things change and we realize how desperately at the bottom of the pit they are.  What happens form that point most be seen afresh to appreciate the ending.<br /><br />There is some comic relief provided Joseph's drinking scraggly-haired drinking partner Tommy (Ned Dennehy) and some songs and dancing at the funeral when Joseph's friend dies, but the overall film is bleak and in the hands of lesser actors than Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman it may not  have worked.  But Considine's writing and direction along with the brilliant performances of these tow actors produces a film that is one of the finest of the year.  This is cinema at its darkest and we should see films like this to realign our own perspectives about how life can be severely difficult.  Grady Harp, April 12she is sterile.

B003BVK36Q|2.0|I was dissapointed once again by le Carre. Can not understand why most of the critiques appraise this book. Sentimantal, pathetic... and anti-American of course. Well, Absolute Friends is anti-American too but definitely more powerfull.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|From the beginning of the picture to the end, there is not a dull moment. This movie is so unique from any other war movies, EVER. The fact that the producers used REAL Navy Seals was just the best thing that could've been done for a war movie. Not to mention, real bullets were used in the gunfight scenes in the film. This just adds to the authenticity of the movie. No stuntmen, here. Of course, Navy Seals actually use real bullets during training, which can be very dangerous. However, these are Seals we are talking about. They know what they are doing. To listen to the weapons being fired during gunfights were just INTENSE, especially when shown in first person. The movie gives the watcher a good idea of what the Navy Seals are like. You can see why the Seals train how they train because of the tactics and preciseness of their shots. Overall, the story is very good. The producers created a fictional story based and inserted REAL ''Acts of Valor&#34; that the SEALS did. In other words, every thing that happen to a SEAL in the movie, actually happened to a SEAL in real life, but in a different scenario. Don't expect great acting! Of course, you shouldn't because the Seals are NOT actors!!!! All I can say is this movie is worth owing, especially for those, who haven't seen it.
0201634988|3.0|While it has the classical content, the CDROM format is very disappointing. It is a great example of a technology applied wrong. This book should have NEVER been published as framed HTML. It is not searchable and totally fails accessibility standards (increasing text size breaks navigation rendering). A flat-text file w/ASCII art really would have more utility. It is only because of content I give this publication 3-star, otherwise it would have been 1-star.
B005FISBTO|3.0|The killer was definitely interesting to me.  In a way, his own inner good vs. evil was almost more interesting then Dexter's.  This might almost be my favorite season so far, except for one thing.<br /><br />The writers seem to have forgotten what Dexter said at the very beginning of the show.  HE HAS NO REAL INTEREST IN SEX!  It started last season with that whole thing last season with Lumen, which made no sense at all.  (He says he has no interest in sex, She is so traumatized by what happened to her that she sleeps in a closet and cowers in a corner with her hands over her ears when she hears people having sex.  Then we are supposed to believe that killing someone together is enough to overcome all that and get them to fall into bed together? Really?) Now, this season, we see him getting BJ's at a high school reunion and a random quickie while on a road trip.  I get that Showtime has to have its gratuitous sex scenes for its audiences, but they could have done it with the other characters (remember all they did with Quinn and his gf in season 4?) without changing something that always made Dexter Dexter.  Yes, I know he and Rita obviously had sex.  After all, We have Harrison, but that was part of his cover as a husband.  Now Rita is gone, so why force something on him that he already feels no need for?  I'm sure I'll buy this season, but this time, mostly because of the deeper exploration of Light vs Dark in religion.  Much more of that pointless character change in Dexter next season, and I'm through with the show.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|This was an awful attempt at making a movie from a book.  They cut corners, changed characters, changed locations and missed entire sections of critical plot development.  Beyond the names, the similarity between the book and movie are minimal at best.
0307956350|2.0|My idea of a thriller is Graham Green's \\"The Human Factor\\" or \\"Restless\\" by William Boyd. These novels are subtle, deceptively simple, and absolutely chilling. \\"The Expats\\" is busy, busy, busy. By the end there is so much hacking, lying, more hacking, deception, hacking, and blablabla that you lose track because you have ceased to care. How in heaven's name did this book get such great jacket blurbs and great prepub buzz?<br /><br />Another question: Why is the only line of Spanish in this book misspelled? Why do I see this all the time? It is not Italian. Editors, if you need help with this, contact me. There's no excuse. Jeez.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Great price when I bought it.  Action-packed movie with cool special effects.  They tried to give the actor's too much emotional range, which kind of makes the movie a little bit lame, but the awesome fight scenes make up for it.
1250008409|4.0|This book takes a very practical approach.  The author's intent is to get people to start meditating only 10 minutes a day and being mindful the rest of the day.  He takes a very laid back approach and is not aggressive or preachy.  He has an interesting background as a monk who wondered around the world looking for enlightenment at various monasteries and he has some very helpful stories from those experiences.<br /><br />This should be considered introductory and practical material for people who are either not familiar with meditation or mindfulness or those who have tried it and been unsuccessful.  It's easy reading and a method that can easily be integrated into anyone's life.  It got me to try meditation again.  I have not been successful at sticking with it on previous attempts.<br /><br />I think it will be useful to those who are looking for a way to lead a more fulfilling and less stressful and hectic life.  The author repeatedly says he is not asking anyone to change what they do or telling them what to do.  He is simply asking them to try to do it with more awareness.  I think he succeeds pretty well and have no problem recommending this book.

I've given two TEDx talks and will be giving another this month - so it was great to read this gem. Jeremy must have watched a huge number of these talks because he understands them through and through. I won't watch another one the same way as I hear his observations in my head.<br /><br />But it's not just about TED talks - this is a great book to read anytime you have a presentation to make - if you have a few minutes to deeply engage and impress your audience, this book is a quick, informative, brilliant guide.

I've heard that women are reading it with the cover hidden because they are embarrassed for others to know it's what they're reading because of the sexual content.  I didn't get that at all. It's somewhat titillating, but as another reviewer said, very sterile.  I was also very distracted by the use of British verbiage supposedly being spoken by these American young adults.  I can't see my 21 year old niece ever using a teacup or \\"fetching\\" someone a cup of tea.  There were many other instances of this throughout the book.  That being said, the book is very well written, defines the characters well, but not enough meat... too much dressing.... it would have done more for me as a darker book...more into the darkness of BDSM lifestyle and the background of Christian Grey.  But I read the whole thing and succumbed to getting the second book already.

I've always watched or read anything about the President, his family, and the assassination.  Stephen King's research of the historical facts were right on which made his novel all the more wonderful for me.  He's a great story teller.  My husband and I belong to a Couples' Book Club and in a couple of months it will be our turn to pick the book and then host that meeting -- I am so excited to pick 11-22-63.  I think the \\"food for thought\\" and the discussion will make for a great evening.

B004EPZ07K|3.0|Over the last decade, the summer and holiday months have been littered with the cast off remains of failed franchises.  Eager for the consistent influx of cash that popular series like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Twilight bring in over the course of years, or even decades, studios have been caught counting their chickens long before they have hatched, hoping that whatever rebooted 80s cartoon, young adult novel, or underused superhero will leaven the strain of actually producing new material.  Some of these failures have taken on the veneer of cult success (I would argue this in the case of the Wachowski's Speed Racer or Joe Johnston's The Rocketeer), where others fail to live up to the promise of their source material (such as Jonah Hex or The Golden Compass), and still others should never have been put into production in the first place (Prince of Persia, Battlefield Earth).  And while there have been rumors of a Green Lantern sequel, I have the feeling that the first film's poor showing at the box office will dissuade the bean counters from risking another go at DC's space cop.  And that's a shame, not because the first film was such a triumph, but because, despite plenty of flaws, there's a lot of potential in the Green Lantern, even if much of it is squandered by the movie's end.<br /><br />I watched Green Lantern after reading some damning reviews, so imagine my surprise when, for at least the first half of the film, the movie turned out to be an engaging balance of sci-fi spectacle and carefully executed character building.  We begin the film in the far reaches of space where some alien astronauts stumble upon a trapped entity known as Parallax who feeds on these victims and escapes.  Parallax proceeds to chase down and mortally wound the Green Lantern who had trapped him in the first place, Abin Sur.  Sur manages to escape from Parallax and crash land on Earth where he, knowing how little time he has left, instructs his ring, the source of a Green Lantern's power, to find a suitable replacement.<br /><br />The ring eventually chooses Hal Jordan, a test pilot for experimental aircraft.  Hal's portrayed as a womanizer whose talents as a pilot far outstrip his discipline.  He works for Ferris Aircraft and has some romantic history with the boss's daughter, Carol Ferris, who also happens to balance her career helping run the family business with her roles as a test pilot along with Hal.  The two must run a demonstration for the government in hopes that Uncle Sam will buy their non-manned fighter pilot drones (take that China!).  While the ultimate goal of this demonstration is to show how good the drones are, Hal decides to break the rules of engagement by taking his jet much higher than permitted, which allows him to take out the drones, but also forces him to crash his plane in the process.  Naturally, Carol is upset when Hal not only uncovers flaws in their product but also trashes a multi-million dollar piece of equipment.<br /><br />Hal is played by Ryan Reynolds, who got his start as a cartoony wiseass in sitcoms and teen comedies but has since attempted to break his way into marginally more serious action work, and he has spent years trying to prove himself as a potential blockbuster lead.  Here his ability to crack a joke not only serves to accentuate his character's freewheeling nature, but also helps ground the more absurdist aspects of a comic book character who was created fifty years ago.  The movie manages to be funny without becoming jokey.  Reynolds also happens to have great chemistry with love interest Carol Ferris, played by Blake Lively.  The two of them have a surprisingly emotionally complicated scene at a local bar for pilots that could have been sliced into a more dramatic film without much trouble.  The central love story reminded me of the scenes in another film by directors Martin Campbell, the James Bond reboot Casino Royale, whose romance between Bond and Vesper served as the heart of the film.<br /><br />It's not long after he downs the company jet that Hal is swept away by Abin Sur's ring and taken to the crash site of Sur's escape pod where the dying alien tells him how to use the ring.  After figuring out the basics Hal is whisked away to the planet Oa, the headquarters of the Guardians, a race of blue aliens who forged the Green Lantern rings in order to form the Green Lantern Corps, a group tasked with policing the entire universe.  The planet Oa is beautifully filmed, a strange mixture of darkened crags, smooth surfaces of technology, and tasteful waves of color.  It is as if an aurora borealis went off in an Apple store after hours.  Here Hal learns of the history of the Green Lanterns and begins his training with Kilowog, a beast of an alien with the face of a pig, the body of a brick wall, and the voice, conveniently enough, of Michael Clark Duncan.<br /><br />It's at this point in the movie where I excitedly awaited for the film to really take off.  Until now there had been some exciting action and nice character work.  Hal had been firmly established as a screw up, adrift in life, hoping for something bigger, and now that fate has handed him the chance to join the Green Lantern Corps, he presumably has a chance to right his course in life.  But in an incredibly contrived moment, he decides that he's not up to snuff, quits the corps and returns to Earth (although, strangely enough, he is allowed to keep the ring).  Instead of the epic space opera I was expecting, the filmmakers decides on something far more quotidian: a superhero movie.  The rest of the film goes through the usual superhero motions: the main character reveals himself to the public by bravely saving hundreds of people and afterwards visits the love interest/damsel in distress.  Green Lantern is a decidedly schizophrenic movie.  Where the first half of the film provides the perfect set up for the \\"hero's journey,\\" a story about one character being plucked from the mundaneworld and lifted into an exciting realm of adventure, the second half of the film seems content on playing superhero connect the dots.  There is even a second villain, a scientist who becomes infected by Parallax, who is obviously there to make sure the action doesn't stray too far from Earth.<br /><br />I'm convinced that the studio didn't really know what they had with the Green Lantern.  Unlike Batman, Spider-Man, or even Superman, the Green Lantern Corps lends itself to interplanetary superheroics more in the vein of Star Wars and Flash Gordon than Iron Man.  But this is also what makes the character exciting.  Where we have seen the basic outline of a superhero movie time and again, Green Lantern offers the chance of more science fiction tropes, which could potentially differentiate him from the glut of other superhero movies.  Instead of shying away from the imaginatively bizarre, the filmmakers should have embraced the alien aspects of the Green Lantern mythos.  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Green Lantern is that it represents a missed opportunity.  The few moments we spend in space are exciting because of their promise of the weird, and because they are one of the few images of space made by people who have actually looked at photographs from the Hubble Telescope.  Instead of peregrine flights of fancy, the movie clings tight to formula, and suffered for it, both artistically and at the box office.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|The basic story is quite interesting, but very slow to develop.  However, I found the author's jumping back and forth in time to be extremely confusing.  In several places I was not sure if I was reading in the present or the past.  A few tips by an author as to what might be coming is OK with me, and even a couple time jumps can work, but in this book the time jumping seemed to be constant and became extremely confusing.
B00466HN72|4.0|I am really picky about the movies I would let my kids watch more than once.  I would buy this movie.  So cute and rockin' !!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|im lovin this app! i would really suggest getting it despite the memory it takes up. really worth it! especially since its freeeee!!!
B006ISJQ1W|2.0|This movie takes place in 1960 and is based on the Hunter S. Thompson Novel of the same name. Johnny Depp stars as... what's his name. I wish I cared. Anyway, he is a new horoscope writer for the San Juan Star (newspaper in Puerto Rico) with a comedic drinking problem. The last writer was fired for a drinking problem and it seems like almost character in this movie has a drinking problem. Soon after arriving, Johnny gets bumped up a level in the newspaper. He then meets what could loosely be considered the movie's villain, played by Aaron Eckhart who tries to buy up Puente Rican land to build a hotel. For whatever reason he needs to bring in a newspaper reporter to put a positive spin on things. It really seemed like Johnny's role in this master plan wasn't needed, especially for a reporter who has had a week of experience.  There is an undertone of the natural inhabitants of Puerto Rico hating the white people from the US and Johnny is a bystander of this all who gets wrapped into it when Aaron Eckhart threatens the locals and Johnny's best friend in the movie ends up offending a local restaurant employee.<br /><br />Johnny falls for a beautiful woman that he later finds out is a taken by a powerful man. This is no romantic story, in fact it ultimately seems to go no where. She becomes a key part in let downs that this movie brings. Certain scenes which I feel are very important are just left out. Not sex scenes, but when she comes to Johnny after an important hiatus, he tells his friend give us a few minutes and it is never mentioned afterward. There is no scene in there.<br /><br />The commercials portray this movie as a comedy and that's what I was expecting. There are moments of comedy and down right hilarity in the movie, but that is equil to about 5 minutes of a 120 minute movie. Most of the comedy comes from Johnny's friend that drives a tiny blue car that doesn't work very well. Somewhere in the movie they end up in a chase scene at night in the little bluecar where Johnny ends up using booze and a lighter to keep the chasers at bay. The damsel in this movie also makes for some good comedy when she's out with Johnny for a drive. But really, everything in the commercial is the only comedy there is.<br /><br />There are some good things though, such as the entire movie takes place in Puerto Rico, so it is colorful, lush, vibrant and beautiful. Scenes of beauty everywhere from crashing waves and bright planes overhead, to lavish jungles to ghettos like the one that Johnny Depp ends up living in.<br /><br />If you are expecting some ultimate ending where good prevails and everything goes like you'd expect... don't. That's one of the many things that will leave you unfulfilled. Nothing really goes anywhere meaningful in this movie. Such as when Aaron Eckhart yells at Johnny for bringing his friend along to a meeting when Johnny signed a confidentiality agreement... nothing happens. You'd think someone would get killed or end up in litigation... nope. Nothing is ever mentioned again. Maybe that's what you get for expecting something. Toward the end I really felt like you could have fast forwarded the last 20 minutes and not missed anything, which is anti climactic. After all of this, I really can't recommend anyone spend 120 minutes of their life to see this.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|This was a good movie, but it was over 3 hours long. There was alot of great actors and actresses in this movie and the story doesn't disappoint.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|The movie is a dvd that I can watch every so often. The arrival was vital because it was for my anniversary and the movie arrived on time. The packaging was sealed tight and had a cover to repel minor damage. The description does not leave any important details out and is accurate. Enjoyable film and has its ups, leaving the movie on a good note.
B0063GORYU|5.0|just like the computer game.  my husband and I save won games on the desktop for each other and sometimes have trouble<br />beating each others games (4 suits).  have this app on both Samsung and Asus tabs, works great, very happy.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have owned this watch for 2+ years and can now authoritatively state that is it a colossal piece of c**p.  Garmin should be ashamed for ever having released this poorly designed, bug infested thing they call a GPS watch.  The touch ring which controls it is either overly sensitive or won't respond at all.  So you have to sometimes stop in the middle of a run or race to get it to do something.  The most annoying feature though, is that it sometimes just won't respond at all.  It will start and record your race but you can't turn it off no matter how many times you push or push and hold start/stop . So it records the post race, the trip to the bathroom and the trip home.  Completely destroys your ability to keep track of and manage your workouts and races.  Which is the whole point of having a GPS running watch.  The 'autopause feature' is worse than worthless.  On top of these 'features', the battery life, fully charged, is 4 hrs, tops, instead of the advertised 8 hrs. So if you are training for a marathon, be very careful. Unless you take it off the charger just before you start, the battery will be mostly gone before you ever start running and completely gone long before you finish. But at least then it won't record your car trip home as part of your race.  So, if like most marathons, you have to wait around for 2+ hrs prior to the race where you can't keep the watch charging, it will run out of battery half way through.  At mile 21 of a marathon it said 'Battery Low' and didn't record the last part of the marathon.  Afterwards, it says that I ran 21 miles on a 26.2 mile certified course.  After all of this, Garmin's warranty is worthless. Because I purchased this POS watch from Amazon, I didn't have a 'real' cash register receipt, they were 'tough luck, no receipt, no warranty'.  The Garmin 910XT & the Motorola MOTOACTV are both great GPS watches.  The Garmin 405CX, horrible GPS watch.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|excellent movie with superb direction from mel gibson. this should of won an oscar for independent release. very realistic depiction of jesus.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games I was eager to start on this book. I had heard that it was even better than the first and it definitely was. I didn't want to put it down once I started to read. From the first page to the last it was non-stop.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are home and doing everything they can to help out the people in their district. Life is basically as it was with some changes. One day she gets a visit from President Snow right before they are to leave on the victor's tour. Her stunt with the berries has lit a fire under those that would revolt against the Capital and he threatens her in order to keep her in line on tour. But its too late. The districts have had enough. The uprisings have already begun when they announce the rules for the Quarter Quell. Katniss and Peeta are going back into the arena and this time only one can come out alive.<br /><br />This books was amazing. I was constantly surprised at what happened next. Nothing about this book was predictable which was a breath of fresh air. I cannot wait to finish this series. It has definitely topped my list of favorites

B007NZDES0|5.0|I had the pleasure of watching SADE in her tour in Dallas, TX and I was about to cut my veins off ... She is just amazing, at 52 yrs old this woman has the same spirit as to when she came out with her first album Diamond Life in 1984. She hasn't lost a bit of her style, sound or smoothness in her music. I definetely recommend her music, videos and perfomances to those new listeners that are about to be contagious with her music. Enjoy everybody SADE at her best ever.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|interesting game that starts easy and get harder as you go. I got this as the aotd and I don't play it all the time but when I do my mind gets a good workout.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The only thing that stopped me from reading this book in one day was the fact that I had to sleep. From the moment I started this book, I was hooked. I had heard from a few people that it was amazing and I have to say that it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Abby isn't your typical college freshman. She is a hard headed girl with a past she would rather forget. Her best friend, America, and her are head off to college together and do their best to steer her in a different direction. One night they go to the secret fight with Shepley, America's boyfriend, and she meets Travis Maddox. Travis is a tattooed bad boy who isn't afraid of anything and is known for his playboy status. Once he lays his eyes on her, neither of them will ever be the same.<br /><br />This book is the story of their love and the rocky road they travel. It isn't a typical fall in love and everything is perfect story. I loved Travis, even with all of his flaws. Some might criticize him, but Abby is just as messed up, she just doesn't show it the way he does. This was a great book and you won't want to put it down until it's done. I loved it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that you earn points to open the new games.  gives me a reason to play.  how many more words.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a lot of fun, and its especially fun for those who grew up playing the original. The only thing I like dislike is that you have to be connected to the Internet to play.
0345803485|5.0|I reallly enjoyed these books.  I downloaded the sequels before finishing the first one.  These are easy reads, if your looking to take your mind off every day life and just enjoy a good book, these are for you.  It's been a long since I have been this into a book.  It can be sexually explicit but I didn't find  offensive.

0385523912|5.0|The book was addicting - Demick did a marvelous job of weaving thoroughly-researched facts with captivating true stories based on a myriad interviews, and presents the city of Chongjin as it if it were a town we could almost touch, feel, see, smell, and hear. Kudos on all the hard work she did to expose just one facet of the ugly, brutal truth of Kim Jong Il's cruel regime (i.e. manmade starvation) and to announce it to the world in a beautifully-delivered way. Thank you, Ms. Demick for all your care and concern for the people of NK and the determination to be their voice to the world!! May the world see it, believe it, and then fight it, even now more than ever with KJI's nasty little spoiled son Kim Jong Un at the helm of the evil empire. FREEDOM FOR NORTH KOREA! CHINA, STOP SENDING BACK NORTH KOREANS & RECOGNIZE THEM FOR THE REFUGEES THEY ARE! STOP VIOLATING THE 1951 CONVENTION!
0062183591|5.0|This funny, fascinating, personal paradigm shattering book is in a genre I love, books that make me examine my thinking process, but this one caused me more soul searching than any other I've read.  According to the Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC) we decide whether or not to be dishonest based on a logical, mathematically calibrated cost-benefit analysis, and we'd all be as dishonest as we could be as long as it brought us a benefit greater than the likely cost. Fortunately, author Dan Ariely discovered that people aren't as cold-bloodedly calculating as that. Unfortunately, the news about human morality isn't all good.<br /><br />Ariely is very skilled at conceiving, conducting and describing experiments that tease apart the tangle of human motivations. According to what he's discovered, we'll cheat, lie and steal, but only as much as we can rationalize because we want to be able to feel good about ourselves. We're all capable of dishonesty, and being natural story tellers we're extremely adept at creating perfectly logical seeming explanations justifying our less than moral actions, though we rarely understand exactly why we make the choices we do.  We  invariably underestimate how much we are influenced by a myriad of circumstances ranging from conflict of interest to how tired we are feeling.<br /><br />Since we want to see ourselves as good, most of us never stray far from the straight and narrow path, but small frequent transgressions can create bigger problems than the egregious acts of a few bad apples. Our collective peccadilloes can wreck havoc, but with an improved understanding of  the situations that increase dishonest behavior Arliey  hopes his book can be a guide for corrective actions and legislation.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I came upon this book because so many friends were telling me how good it was, and once the movie came out I was determined to read the book before I saw the movie. At first I didn't see what the big deal was, sure it wasnt bad, maybe it didn't hold my attention the whole time in the beginning, but once the games started I got it. The games are brutal, killing to live, killing to survive, and under it all is a story of love and understanding. Definiitly worth the read!

0871404133|5.0|'Where Did We Come From?,' 'What Are We?'' and 'Where Are We Going?' are the three fundamental questions raised in Wilson's latest book. Author Wilson's work challenges one of the central tenets of evolution - that natural selection acts far more strongly on individuals and genetic relatives than on broader social groups. \\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\" also reverses his prior view that the evolution of altruism was driven by kin selection rather than group selection. As cooperative colonies dominate non-cooperative ones and multiply, so do their alleged 'altruism' genes.<br /><br />Much of the author's logic is derived from social insects like bees, ants, and termites. Mr. Wilson contends that the competition of one group against others favors self-sacrificial behaviors in individuals that benefit the group - even those that aren't related. The 'bad news' for the real devotees of the topic, is that more than 130 of his peers wrote a public letter last year contending his latest thinking is wrong. Wilson, however, isn't bothered - also declaring that the function of this new book is to upset the current thinking, and that he expects to be lambasted.<br /><br />The term 'eusocial' plays a large role in the book. It is used to describe situations with reproductive division of labor (with/without sterile castes such as ants, bees, wasps, termites, naked mole rates), overlapping generations, and cooperative care of the young. Wilson contends that eusociality is one of the major innovations in the history of life, spurred originally by nests (birds), burrows (moles, etc.), and campsites (humans).<br /><br />Roots of society begin with offspring remaining with parents long term, each tolerating the other, and the group then growing to include additional generations, aunts, uncles, and even unrelated individuals. These pre-humans not only had to be altruistic/sharing, but murderous as well, at times - fighting off other groups.<br /><br />Side Bits: Eusocial insects evolved well over 100 million years ago, while humans have evolved only over the past half million years. Neanderthals became extinct only 30,000 years ago - Wilson challenges us to imagine the racial discrimination issues if their lineage had continued through today.<br /><br />Humans' ultimate success rests on our being a large terrestrial animal (supports a big brain, allows the use of fire), and having grasping hands with opposable thumbs.<br /><br />The bulk of 'The Social Conquest of Earth' consists of explanations for how humans evolved. For example, we learned/developed walking on our hind legs and then running to catch prey, learning to throw (eg. spears), living around campsites (similar to birds' nests, fox burrows, lion prides), and becoming meat-eating helped expand our brains to develop and implement complex strategies (eg. wolves, lions). Living at campsites encouraged job specialization and sharing.<br /><br />The destructive consequences of incest is a general phenomenon in humans, plants, and animals. Among all 19 social species whose mating patterns have been studied, young individuals leave the group they were born in and join another - in some species it is the males that leave, in other the females, and in a few both sexes depart. In humans, exogamy occurs in the form of young adults, usually women, being exchanged between trives. Secondly, little sexual activity takes place between closely related individuals. Other examples have led Wilson to conclude that humans develop little sexual interest in those known closely during their earliest years.<br /><br />Wilson also covers the origins of religion, language, culture (spread largely by imitation within groups), and the birth of sociality, though not in great detail. Every religion teaches that its adherents are a special fellowship and that their moral precepts and privileges from divine power are special. Charity and altruistic acts are concentrated on their fellow believers; when extended to outsiders it is usually to proselytize and boost their numbers. Hallucinogenic drugs play an important role in the creation of genesis myths. Wilson sees religions as encouraging ignorance, even of other religions, distracting people from recognizing problems of the real world, and often leading them in wrong directions.<br /><br />Where are we going? Scientific knowledge and technology double every 1 - 2 decades, making the future hard to predict beyond a decade. Science will eventually upend religion by demonstrating its man-made origins. Wilson cites declining percentages of scientists believing in a supernatural being; evolutionary biologists are down to only 2%.<br /><br />Ending, Wilson says it is time to ask seriously why, during the 3.5 million year history of Earth our planet has never been visited by extraterrestrials or even received a message from outer space. We should also stop the dangerous delusion that emigration into space is a solution when we have used up this planet.<br /><br />Wilson's latest book and the controversy it has engendered also tells us that we are in the midst of expanding/revising evolutionary thinking.ers it is usually to proselytize and boost their numbers.

B006H5120E|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE \\"TITANIC in 3D\\" MOVIE on BLU RAY ***<br /><br />Holidaying in Ireland, I happened on the preview day of James Cameron's \\"Titanic in 3D\\" at the new Odeon Cinema in The Point Area of Dublin's refurbished docklands (or \\"The Quays\\" as they're known locally). We caught the first showing on 5 April 2012 - debuting on their all-bells-and-whistles \\"iSense Screen\\". \\"iSense\\" features razor sharp Real-3D imaging on a gigantic screen with state-of-the-art surround sound. So myself and the two kids popped along - donned the crazy specs - and started to watch. The sheer spectacle of what came next has prompted me to write this review...<br /><br />I've seen about 10 films in 3D - some like \\"Despicable Me\\" have impressed and actually met the hype - the rest have either felt gimmicky or a downright hindrance - or worse a crass monetary exploitation. Even the new Aardman Animation feature film \\"The Pirates...\\" - which we'd seen some days earlier - is not great in 3D (although it's a top movie and thoroughly recommended). But Cameron's complete reshaping of \\"Titanic\\" into a 3D realm is a different beast. It's incredible and at times I was genuinely gobsmacked. I saw the film on its original outing in 1997 (which was a cinematic experience to say the least) and I'd estimate that 65 to 75% of this version has been improved by the 3D process with the remaining portions varying between not changed at all or just slightly better - but definitely better.<br /><br />So what's changed? Scenes that were somehow 'ordinary' before are now 'dimensional' - at times you feel you could reach out and actually touch them...<br /><br />Examples - the front railings of the sunken liner at the bottom of the Atlantic at the beginning of the film, the unmanned sub that is filming it then making its way through the insides of the wreck - you now feel the machine and its cables - the space around it - the bubbling of the water - the barnacles and silt disturbed to the left and right. When the engine room ship-sized pistons kick into gear as the last boilers are lit - their size and power; the drinks glasses on the table at dinner as Bruce Ismay pompously tells of how he arrived at the ship's name - they have space around them and you feel you could almost lift them off the tablecloths. Even something as unassuming as Molly Brown's decorative hat as she talks to Jack (at a later dinner table setting) now reaches out of the screen into the aisles with extraordinary depth. Winslet's costumes are glorious too - her radiant eyes and lustrous hair. The feeling of sea air and wind on the ship's gangways when Rose and Jack walk and talk and discuss art is accentuated - more realistic.<br /><br />But if I was to note just one scene that sums up how improved this version is - it would be the one where Rose tries to kill herself by jumping off the back of the ship. As she steps over the railings and the camera looks down at the cold wash below - suddenly the distance and the hugeness of the ship becomes 'real' - looking downward and with that added depth - you can 'feel' that fall...that freezing water below...<br /><br />The sound is huge too - groaning steel - creaking wood - the water crashing out of the screen right into your face as it floods corridors...<br /><br />There were occasions where 3D didn't work - where the effect was detrimental rather than an enhancement - the boarding of the great ship at Southampton was one scene where too much was going on in the crowd sequences for the 3D to catch up. Other offences would be that one character on screen would be razor-sharp image-wise (usually the one talking) - while those beside them or to the left of them - would be slightly blurred. But these were rare.<br /><br />What you also forget is what an incredible movie \\"Titanic\\" is. Like that other maverick filmmaker Ridley Scott (\\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"The Kingdom Of Heaven\\") - James Cameron isn't afraid of spectacle - he embraces it. Hebrings it to the screen with bravado and a passion for 'detail' that few have matched. His new 3D rendering of \\"Titanic\\" is the same - it seems like he's worked everything to give you the viewer as much as possible - or at least more than you saw the last time. And when the actual sinking finally comes in the early hours of 15 April 1912 - the horror and heartbreak still has the power to make your heart race and bring a tear to the eye. Captain Smith holding the wheel as the ocean crashes through the glass into the bridge area, the ship's funnel that breaks loose and collapses on the bodies below, the propellers rising out of the water, bodies bouncing off the ship's steel structures as the huge hull rises up and they slide downwards to their death - the camera panning back as Rose emerges from the swell to an ocean of bodies flaying about in the agony of the icy Atlantic - the guilty faces on the lucky ones in the boats that got away - hearing their screams and cries for help - yet not going back for survivors - and knowing they should...<br /><br />Cameron's version of the sad tale has heart too - through all that technical excellence it doesn't forget to show - and somehow respect - the human cost. There's the rage and helplessness of the third class passengers locked into steerage below while the 'quality' on the decks above get the 'priority' placing in the lifeboats their tickets paid for - the band unselfishly playing \\"Nearer My God To Thee\\" as the ship goes down by the head, the priest praying with terrified passengers trying to give them strength, the elderly couple holding each other tightly on the bed as the sea floods their cabin - the Irish mum telling her two children of 'Tir na N'Og' - the mythical 'land of the young' as the inevitable closes in around her beloved...<br /><br />Then of course there's the cast - Bill Paxton as the obsessed present-day treasure-seeker, Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting the tragedy to an enrapt crew, Jonathan Hyde as Bruce Ismay - the White Star Line egotist who ordered the number of lifeboats to be reduced from 48 to 16 (compliant with Board of Trade laws at the time) so as not to clutter up the promenade decks for the first-class passengers - and then once onboard practically ordering Captain Smith to open all engines to full speed ahead despite the danger (only to save himself in one of the last lifeboats - an act infamous now in history). Frances Fisher is Rose's social-climbing mum, Billy Zane as Rose's manipulative and jealous boor of a fianc&eacute;, David Warner as his dastardly man-servant, Bernard Hill as the overwhelmed and ill-fated Captain Smith, 'new money' Kathy Bates as the 'unsinkable' Molly Brown - all of them exemplary. Victor Garber adds huge gravitas too as the ship's architect Thomas Andrews - a decent man grappling with his thoughts as it all falls apart around him (his dialogue titles this review).<br /><br />But the movie belongs to its two young leads - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose - a 17-year-old lady of art and means who falls in love with a 20-year old street-rat who paints to survive. While DiCaprio is good and couldn't go anywhere for a few years due to screaming girls (he was 22 at the time) - it's Winslet who impresses the most. She is sensational in the role - voluptuous, ballsy and humane. She also exudes an acting confidence that is staggering for a 21-year-old. In my book only Kiera Knightley gets this close to that kind of inner belief.<br /><br />With regard to the 3D Film on BLU RAY (Sept 2012) - it arrives in multiple versions - a 2D Standard Blu Ray set, this 4-disc 3D version and a DELUXE BOX SET with memorabilia. There are 6 hours of extras, over 25 deleted scenes and endless in-depth interviews. It's a feast of detail. And there's also no doubt in my mind that Cameron has given '3D' a huge boost with this extraordinary rendering of his 1997 classic...<br /><br />To sum up - even if you don't want to seethis film again - and suffer through that dreadful Celine Dion schlock song at the end - think of James Cameron's \\"Titanic in 3D\\" as sheer cinematic spectacle. My kids are 18 and 14 - and given that their generation is so easily bored and their timespan for attention virtually nil - they didn't notice the three-hours-plus playing time go by. In fact my son Sean announced at the end \\"...that was a great film Dad...really good.\\" I could see it in his young face - he was genuinely moved by what he'd just seen.<br /><br />Praise indeed.Hyde as Bruce Ismay - the White Star Line egotist who ordered the number of lifeboats to be reduced from 48 to 16 (compliant with Board of Trade laws at the time) so as not to clutter up the promenade decks for the first-class passengers - and then once onboard practically ordering Captain Smith to open all engines to full speed ahead despite the danger (only to save himself in one of the last lifeboats - an act infamous now in history). Frances Fisher is Rose's social-climbing mum, Billy Zane as Rose's manipulative and jealous boor of a fiancé, David Warner as his dastardly man-servant, Bernard Hill as the overwhelmed and ill-fated Captain Smith, 'new money' Kathy Bates as the 'unsinkable' Molly Brown - all of them exemplary. Victor Garber adds huge gravitas too as the ship's architect Thomas Andrews - a decent man grappling with his thoughts as it all falls apart around him (his dialogue titles this review).<br /><br />But the movie belongs to its two young leads - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose - a 17-year-old lady of art and means who falls in love with a 20-year old street-rat who paints to survive. While DiCaprio is good and couldn't go anywhere for a few years due to screaming girls (he was 22 at the time) - it's Winslet who impresses the most. She is sensational in the role - voluptuous, ballsy and humane. She also exudes an acting confidence that is staggering for a 21-year-old. In my book only Kiera Knightley gets this close to that kind of inner belief.<br /><br />With regard to the 3D Film on BLU RAY (Sept 2012) - it arrives in multiple versions - a 2D Standard Blu Ray set, this 4-disc 3D version and a DELUXE BOX SET with memorabilia. There are 6 hours of extras, over 25 deleted scenes and endless in-depth interviews. It's a feast of detail. And there's also no doubt in my mind that Cameron has given '3D' a huge boost with this extraordinary rendering of his 1997 classic...<br /><br />To sum up - even if you don't want to see this film again - and suffer through that dreadful Celine Dion schlock song at the end - think of James Cameron's \\"Titanic in 3D\\" as sheer cinematic spectacle.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game its a lot like fantasy town but a little better get this game and have fun!!
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I bought this board for a mid range build. I paired it with the following:<br /><br />AMD FX-6100 processor<br />Hyper 212EVO CPU cooler<br />16GB Corsair Vengence 1600mhz DDR3 Ram<br />EVGA GTX560<br />OCZ Modxstream 600W PSU<br />ASUS DVD burner<br />WD Caviar 500gb HD<br /><br />I've built another AM3+ PC using an FX-8150 and Asus Crosshair V motherboard. I have loved this setup (Great BIOS/UEFI, really stable) and have had this machine running about 1 month now. I got this newer setup as a mid range machine to carry with me as I travel a good bit. The Gigabyte board installed easily in my Antec Lanboy Air case and I didn't have to update the BIOS in order to get the bulldozer chip to work (this is an issue on some early AM3+ boards from many different manufacturers). So, I get the entire machine up and running, windows installed, latest drivers installed, and downloaded the latest BIOS using Gigabytes updating software. Everything sounds good right?<br /><br />Well, if you're not overclocking then you can stop reading here because this board was super stable and it is perfect out of the box. However if you do overclock read further.<br /><br />I had weird throttling issues on the fx cpu and inconsistent core voltages. I disabled turbo core, c1e, c6e. There was no option to disable APM (or whatever the power management thing was called). Running Prime95, my multipliers would drop randomly, and although I had a 4.3 ghz overclock, I would frequently see only 3000 mhz using CPU-Z. I tried disabling different combinations of turbo core, C1E, LLC, etc. Nothing helped. Lots of other users apparently have had this issue (at least according to the forums I was researching). I tried almost all night with no luck. Then, I found out that there is a beta version of the bios on the Gigabyte website. You can't download it through Gigabyte's included software. You have to download from the website. I think it was F6K or something like that. Upon flashing this BIOS, I was able to disable APM (it was not there on the F5 version). This stopped all the throttling issues and now the board and CPU overclock like a champ. I have it stable at 4.3 ghz right now and CPU-Z is showing the correct speeds. Also, I no longer have big fluctuations on the core voltages.<br /><br />Getting over that small roadblock has really let this machine open up. Not much else to say...all the drivers worked, no loose heatsinks, all the ports are functioning, and I am very happy. I just wish that you didn't have to use a BETA bios for FX series processors in order to perform basic overclocking. These CPU's have been out since last year. It just seems like this would be out of beta form by now.

B004PE1SZ8|5.0|The ancient warrior Hellion would have enjoyed the brutality, warrior credo, and undying loyalty to country and nobility under threat - in the epic, graphic masterpiece \\"300\\". Written by Frank Miller; directed by Zack Snyder; starring Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas), Lena Neadey (as Queen Gorgo), voice-over narrative by David Wenham (as Dilios). and Rodrigo Santoro (as Xerxes). Premise: King Leonidas leads 300 Spartans against an army of one million soldiers, who seek to ravage and enslave Sparta and Greece. Themes: freedom & tyranny, sacrifice on the battlefield, extreme heroism that has inspired warriors throughout the centuries, and a just cause to defend one's own home country from invaders. Our empathy runs strong. Our catharsis is assured. We care what happens.<br /><br />We can identify with these warriors on many levels. Their sacrifice of life itself ennobles their place in history. This film has high-end epic drama-type acting & physicality, Shakespearean dialogue, horrific battle scenes, deceit, betrayal, treason underfoot, treachery, seamless & robust film editing, fierce as possible close combat scenarios that deserve repeated viewing, and early on sensuality - prior to the first battles between the 300 Spartans and their adversaries at the Hot Gates (Thermopylae).<br /><br />This film has fire & death, shield & sword, true heroism pitted against impossible odds - the likes of which warriors - tamed and untamed, trained, seasoned by uncommon valor & combat, worn thin by hypocrisy, glad for battle to freshen the senses and sharpen one's fighting prowess - can draw from the well of battle history in order to remain a true fighting unit under one commander. An exceptional action movie. All unities adhered to. The crescendo ran like a jolt of electricity from the opening scenes where King Leonidas sends the messengers of Xerxes to their death in the pit until the 300 Spartans face their final battle unto death. It struck a chord throughout the world, echoing universal themes that are held dear. These words from the only warrior left alive from the original 300 Spartans rings true to this day:<br /><br />Dilios: \\"This day we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny!\\"
B002GYI9C4|2.0|OMG sanity check! This is The weirdest rated book I have yet to come across. According to the ratings it should be really good but it reads like something written by an eleven year old. its not so much that its bad but rather that it is seriously not good. If you want to keep up your suspension of disbelief you better gear up with some heavy duty suspenders and hope they keep you up, rather than say snag on the ponderous plot, leaving you to be dragged to death.

B002E3DE40|5.0|In German<br /><br />Komme was wolle hat deutsches Kino hohe Markierungen mit dem epischen Meisterwerk Das Boot\\" erreicht. Dieser Film hat Filme Gänger durch die Welt erlaubt, die inneren Arbeiten, knappen Dialog, Unterwasserschlachtgefahr und Spannung, und volle Drosselklappenhandlung zu beobachten, haben auf einem deutschen Unterseeboot im Atlantik während WWII verwickelt. Kriegführung hat eine Ganze neue Bedeutung mit diesem Film angenommen. Plötzlich wurde das Publikum unter der Oberfläche des Ozeans gestürzt, wenn der Kapitän schreit, Kopfsprung, Kopfsprung\\"! Wir wissen, was er jetzt bedeutet. Wir nehmen die Pflicht von einem untersee an und durch diese Geschichte - es beeinflusst unser Mitgefühl, seelische Läuterung, und Sinn des Realismus innerhalb eines mächtigen, ausgeprägten, und bedeutungsvollen Crescendos. Es hat einen herrlichen dénouement.<br /><br />Ganz sind wir allein in unseren Gedanken als die U-96 und ihr Mannschaftsausguss nach dem Meeresboden, Wasserbomben zu entkommen. Wir fühlen Schmerz, Angst, Zittern, suffication, und unterschiedliche Gefühle - einer verbindet mit Krieg - durch Erlauben unserer Sinne, gelegentlich durch die intensive Handlung und den Realismus innerhalb ihrer zugeteilten Mission überwältigt zu werden. In vielen Wegen hat dieser Film die Wegleute anschauen Krieg verändert. Außergewöhnliches Spielen, Ausarbeiten schriftlich, Film redigierend, Kinematografie, Richtung, sich anhört Wirkungen, und Filmsoundtrackarbeit - alle beigetragene zu Schaffen dieses klassischen Kriegesfilms, der einen einmaligen Standard für alle zukünftigen Kriegfilme gesetzt hat. Dies war, das Publikum in die Schlacht zu stellen. Dies wurde sogar mit Untertitel und einem zähen empirischen plotline vollendet.<br /><br />Innerhalb dieses Films sind wir innerhalb einer unerbittlichen Kriegesgeschichte zu solchem grobkörnigen Realismus, Leben entblößt & Toddrücke, Aufregung, die taub Klänge von Unterwasserschlachten machen, und entweiht militärische Fachsprache - das muss die mit einer Herzenbedingung oder einer Empfindlichkeit gegen solche Gewalttätigkeit warnen -, dass das Zuschauen von der redigierten Version von ihm auf einem kleineren Schirm zu bedenken. Alle Einigkeiten haben zu gehaftet. Geschriebenen/geleiteten durch Wolfgang Petersen, der von Günter Rohrbach hergestellt wird; hat die Hauptrolle Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, und Klaus Wennemann; hat vom deutschen Roman Da Stiefel\\" durch Lothar-Günther Buchheim angepasst.

0451529065|5.0|I re-read On the Origin about a year ago. In the book, Darwin discusses the fact that humans are causing other animals to change, and he talks about the many different breeds (or \\"races\\", as he calls them) of domesticated pigeons that breeders were able to create (or design) through selective breeding. Darwin knew that all these breeds of pigeons descended from a single shared ancestor - the rock pigeon. He knew that pigeon breeders were able to design new breeds of pigeons, specifically adapted to various tasks, by artificially selecting and preserving in future generations the traits they favored in each new breed.<br /><br />Darwin's big idea was the realization that the same thing happens in nature. He recognized that the offspring of any species are born with different traits (variation), and that not all of these offspring survive to pass on their particular traits to future generations. Therefore, the traits that don't help an offspring survive are lost with the dead offspring, while the traits that advance survival are automatically passed on to the next generation when the successful offspring reproduces.<br /><br />As the successful traits accumulate over many generations, they will eventually dominate the entire population, giving rise to new species. Darwin called this \\"natural selection.\\" He discovered that it's responsible for adaptation, and ultimately all biological diversity on this planet.<br /><br />Having said that, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" is badly dated. Much of it is wrong, and turns into a frustrating read, as Darwin tries desperately to describe the mechanism behind variation without understanding genetics.<br /><br />The few things that are correct (basically, Darwin's description of natural selection), can be summarized in three or four paragraphs. Unless you long for nostalgia, there's no reason that this book should be on your reading list. If you want to learn something new about evolution, read Neil Shubin's [[ASIN:0307277453 Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (Vintage)]] or Jerry Coyne's [[ASIN:B002ZNJWJU Why Evolution Is True]] instead.

B004WBVPR0|5.0|Come hell or high water, German cinema achieved high marks with the epic masterpiece \\"Das Boot\\". This film allowed movie goers throughout the world to observe the inner workings, terse dialogue, underwater battle danger and suspense, and full throttle action involved on a German submarine in the Atlantic during WWII. Warfare took on a whole new meaning with this motion picture. Suddenly the audience was plunged under the surface of the ocean when the Captain shouts out, \\"Dive, Dive!\\" We know what he means now. We accept the duty of a submariner and throughout this story - it affects our empathy, catharsis, and sense of realism within a powerful, incisive, and meaningful crescendo. It has a superb dénouement.<br /><br />Throughout, we are alone in our thoughts as the U-96 and her crew sink towards the ocean floor to escape depth charges. We feel pain, fear, trembling, suffication, and varying emotions - one associates with war - by allowing our senses to be overwhelmed at times by the intense action and realism within their assigned mission. In many ways, this film altered the way people look at war. Exceptional acting, scripting, film editing, cinematography, direction, sound effects, and motion picture soundtrack work - all contributed to creating this classical war movie, that set a unique standard for all future war movies. This was to put the audience into the battle. This was accomplished even with sub-titles and a tough experiential plotline.<br /><br />Within this film, we are exposed within a relentless war story to such gritty realism, life & death pressures, excitement, deafening sounds of underwater battles, and profane military jargon - that one has to caution those with a heart condition or a sensitivity to such violence - to consider watching the edited version of it on a smaller screen. All unities adhered to. Written/directed by Wolfgang Petersen, produced by Günter Rohrbach; starring Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann; adapted from the German novel \\"Das Boot\\" by Lothar-Günther Buchheim.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|It is totally inexplicable, but this book IS undeniably addicting. Much in the same way Twilight was simultaneously deeply flawed and yet total perfection, you will love and loathe Ana and Christian in equal measure. Sure, Christian is controlling and possessive - but he's also HOT! And yeah, Ana is naive to the point of stupidity, but um...Christian is so HOT! You can't help but root for them to fall in love. Despite being a completely rational person, I found myself wishing Ana would just GET IN THE DAMN RED ROOM ALREADY AND STOP BEING SUCH A BABY...so, yeah...it's a lot like having a temporary brain fever.<br /><br />If you found Fifty Shades enjoyable (or even if you didn't!), I'd recommend checking out the ALIBI series - in particular the character of Charles reminds me of Fifty (sans the BDSM, for better or worse) and the intertwining plots are really intriguing. Actually, the fact that it actually HAS a plot sort of sets it apart from Fifty Shades. It has all the addictiveness with none of the need to shower profusely after reading :P [[ASIN:B007FUG9ZI ALIBI Volumes I-IV: The Complete Series]]

B001NLKT60|4.0|This book in the trilogy is rather predictable. You can almost imagine Larsson's outline and his planning of who shows up where as the drama unfolds.

WAY to much crowd participation the band had them sing on almost every song and the best parts no less. Interaction with the crowd seemed forced and very lame,same goes for the F bombs, doesnt seem to fit AB style.

Esta película permitió película asiduos a través del mundo para observar los trabajos interiores, diálogo breve, peligro submarino de batalla y suspenso, y a toda marcha acción implicó en un submarino alemán en el Atlántico durante l Segunda Guerra Mundial. La guerra tomó un total nuevo significado con esta película. ¡De repente la audiencia fue hundida bajo la superficie del océano cuando el Capitán grita, \\"Clavado, Clavado\\"! Sabemos lo que significa ahora.

Nos sentimos dolor, el temor, temblar, suffication, y variar emociones - uno se asocia con la guerra - permitiendo nuestros sentidos para ser agobiados a veces por la acción y el realismo intensos dentro de su misión asignada. En muchos sentidos, esta película alteró la manera que personas miran la guerra. La actuación excepcional, redactar, la película que redacta, la cinematografía, la dirección, los efectos sonoros, y el trabajo de banda sonora de película - todo contribuido a crear esta película clásica de la guerra, que puso un estándar extraordinario para todas las futuras películas de la guerra.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased 2 Kindle Fires for my kids, 12 & 17, and got these cases at the same time (a grey & black) mainly so they could differentiate whose was whose, plus for protection. I'd never dream of getting them an electronic device without some sort of cover/protection-- I've seen too many of their friends end up with broken items... kids will be kids.  The design of these cases is very good and it's rugged! I purchased a 3rd when I got my Fire, too.  Both my kids have had drops that would have damaged the device had they not had this cover-- and I just had one a few minutes ago, prompting my review. :)<br /><br />The only difficulty I had was when I ordered the pink cover for myself and my youngest wanted to trade me her grey, it was a bit difficult getting the Fire out of the case.  Complaining? Absolutely not! I want my Kindle to be securely fitted in it's protective cover! My girls' complaint would be that the inside cover gets 'linty' and pills after lots of use (the youngest carries a lint brush around in her backpack, so she's solved that). The pilling doesn't bother me, it's made to use not worship as they say.<br /><br />Parents should make this purchase on the same day they order their Kindle Fire-- don't risk a broken device. Each of my kids have friends who've broken their screen-- one from dropping, one from falling on the ice. Had they had a cover on them, I'm sure they would have been able to grip them better and it would have offered a bit of shock resistance.
