B000YMHOUS|2.0|But the movie is not particular good, or well directed, or well written, or even well acted.  In fact it gets pretty ham handed trying to preach a social message that isn't even relevant unless you live in some hyper conservative area (urban dwellers will quickly start to wonder when something interesting is going to happen...psst, it won't).  At times I honestly thought I was watching something made-for-tv, but the all star cast kept reminding me that it actually appeared in theaters.  The only reason I finished it was because I was cooking and left it playing in the background because it didn't seem necessary to give it my full attention.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to read my books on the way to work.  So many books available to buy and choice from.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Vary fun and addictive game. Also challenging. My grandson and I have fun playing together. We try to see who gets the most points.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is an amazing book. My friends were all reading it so I gave it a try. I couldn't put it down. No joke. I recommend this book to tweens/teens adults could read this but I think teens can relate to it best! The story is about a girl named Ali that goes missing and each chapter is from a different one of her friends' point of view. They all get weird messages from someone named 'A' and they can't figure out who it is. Hope you enjoy this book and will read the rest of the series!
B009LDD4V4|4.0|A good season of a great show.  The Special Features offered are less than other seasons, but still a good DVD Set.
0920236162|5.0|Fabulous book and a must read for any child!  I have two girls and they thought it was hilarious but I think it's appropriate for a boy too.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I use this app all the time for a work Facebook page that I manage. I can post pictures of our products and I get post by customers immediately so they feel the customer first satisfaction.
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|Always one of my faves. The last of the big three. Beggars, Bleed and Sticky!<br />Those three are all way better than Exile.
0763660531|5.0|Exceeded expectations, beautiful and a great story!  Not a single word but the story was clear and engaging.  It is great!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not a bad little game. Your standard hunt and peck with a few challenges. Overall a good time waster and brain tingler but a little boring on the music and graphics. There's no WOW when you solve the puzzle to open the door. With a little bit of tweaking and maybe a bit of checking out the competition( the ROOM is a great example) the developer could make this an awesome play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an affective way to have fun while look and try to dogde trains obstacles and trained fat men
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Everyone must read and use the Secret. The law of attraction is very powerful. Anyone can do this. Very powerful information.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|A friend of mine recommended the work of David Mitchell, so I started with this book. The basic idea here is that there are a series of interrelated narratives that take place during various centuries past, present and future. The connecting thread is a little thin in places but basically we start in the 1930s with a young British composer who has had to leave England because of unpaid debts and ends up living with an older British composer and his family near Bruges in Belgium. We jump to the 1970s to follow the story of a friend of the young composer who has become a brilliant scientist involved in a dubious nuclear power scheme to get rich quick. Then we jump ahead to the future where genetic engineering has run amuck. Then even further into the future where civilization has collapsed. And so on. It was fun to read, but the ultimate purpose or message eluded me.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very challenging and can be frustrating but never boring. Love this game. Prefer this game to others via facebook. Keeps boredom away.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|It was  awesome I heart jace hehe xoxox. This review posted by my 16 year old daughter. Clearly a hit.
B00911UQAS|5.0|awesome, the size of the Rex is good for the price, very fun to assemble ( be careful with some tiny pieces) it doesn't need glue.
034580404X|5.0|This is an excellent book set! A very good read. Too bad I've finished reading them. :( I want more E.L. James to read.
0143118757|5.0|It is practical and interesting, the redaction is clear and the order is functional. You read without stop, the examples are perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a cool game I would recommend this game to my cousin Dylan he's 2years old and would snatch a strangers phone just to play a game.
B00F3A732K|5.0|Awesome movie, and as a fellow Actor this movie has amazing Acting in it. With unforgettable performances, ranging from action, to comedy, drama and suspense. It has a perfect Blu-ray quality picture, this is the type of movie Blu-ray was made for. So you can experience a story that will entertain you, while keeping you on the edge of your seat, with action packed scenes in stunning high definition. Also the special edition Steelbook case arrived in mint condition, and is a great limited edition collectors item to add to anyone's collection.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Fast service and inexpensive.  My wife has a vision problem and finds it very difficult, if not impossible, to read a book
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I love this game but I need gameloft to add more content and new features on the game like play store version please.<br />Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I HATE this game!!! I am totally addicted!!! Every time I play, I yell and cuss because it's so fun and frustrating at the same time. Thank you so much for allowing me to get this game for free! It is synced with my Facebook so I can brag about how far I get. ;)
B003477DVK|5.0|My 8 year old grandson loves dogs and this story was both fun and emotional for him.  It provides a view to some aspects of life in the south in the 50's that many of us would rather forget and gives a glimpse of some of the after effects of young men going to war, but does so in a non-confrontational and non-preachy sort of way.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It works great, looks nice, is easy to read and wakes me to the music I choose.  I can tell at a glance what type of weather I'm dressing for, it's much cheaper than buying a new clock and is very easy to setup!
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Oh, my, where to begin?!? This is the most original, imaginative, and thought-provoking sci-fi that I've read in years! What unique characters, and such a rich tapestry of a background. I can't wait for more!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great, basic case for iPhone 4 and 4S.  Case feels sturdy and protective, but is flexible.  I like that it's clear so the Apple logo and the address label I put on the back of the phone are visible.  Would prefer the edges to be more rounded, but that's a small point at this price.  The screen protector is high quality and a pleasant bonus.
B007NR9WBG|4.0|I have always liked this movie because of the star quality of the actors.  My only disappointment was the way the film was presented on DVD.  The Blu-ray version is much better and well worth the cost.  Highly recommended.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have always read most of John Grisham's books. Some have been wonderful  but some have been mediocre and one or two,thoughtless. I love the way he tells a story . I'm a Southerner and he speaks to me in my language. This novel grabbed me fom the beginning and had me going until I finished it. A true story of justice being served generations later. I loved it.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Just goes to show that Shakespeare is still relevant.  Whedon is the perfect director, too, since the showpiece of this play is the witty banter and strong ensemble cast.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I cried and I laughed. This book is definitely one of my favorites. I highly recommend it. It made me feel sad and happy and mad and encouraged and it made me look at myself. My precept: The only thing that could keep you from greatness is your own thoughts, cannot be anything else.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|What more can be said about this cult classic of a film?  I've owned this film in VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray and watched it what seems like hundreds of times.  After 35 years it is still holds its own.  Highly recommended - share it with your friends.
B00DDUIW18|3.0|I prefer to order hard copy,  e-book doesn't contain DVD and register key to login web site. And price is almost the same.
0689878451|5.0|An illustrated true story for all ages about two gay penguins in the NY zoo who built a nest and sat on a large stone until the zoo keeper took pity on them and replaced the stone with an extra egg that eventually hatched making them proud parents.  I have bought several of these books to give to kids and friends.  Everyone loves it, particularly because it is true.
082300659X|5.0|Whether you are interested in learning to draw, or are just curious about the process as an observer of art, this is an outstanding book. It is clearly written, and illustrated with elegant artwork by contemporary artists and old masters.  The book includes a DVD with video demonstrations by the author.<br /><br />“Every good drawing exhibits an understanding and control of tone, proportion, harmony, and composition.”<br /><br />In the chapter on the illusion of depth, Aristides tells a story of how her teacher explained “a profound relationship between art, artists, and viewer” in Caravaggio’s Supper at Emmaus. “So Myron showed us that the figures sitting at the table were resting inside a sphere; the figures hug the one side and we (the viewer) complete the circle… Caravaggio includes us at the table by having us complete the ellipse started by the figures in his painting.”<br /><br />The author explains how to use a nine-step value scale. “Some artists even make holes in each value so they can look through at their subject and see if the values match… The digital camera I use has 256 values. I was taught to use nine… Keep in mind that if you cannot manage six values to good effect, it is unlikely you will handle fifty any better… A restrained value palette provides an elegant scaffolding for great art.”<br /><br />Artistides explains that “light is to art as air is to life… The brilliance of light depends on the shadow.” She emphasizes the importance of core shadow. “No single line is more crucial to form drawing than this one… it must convey strength and accuracy.” Another notable bit of wisdom:  “White is best used like salt—sparingly.”<br /><br />“Remember that it is your goal to create not a photographic likeness, but an emotional accuracy. Your drawing doesn’t have to look just like your subject; it just has to be honest, consistent, and believable.”
B003L77G6K|4.0|This is a great addition to the first three seasons and continues to deliver excellent comedy and fun.  Highly recommended.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This series has wit for the adults and great stories for the kids.  It's one of my favorites of all time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first book in the trilogy.  There is a lot of violence in these books. It is a very exciting read and the book is hard to put down.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I've long been a fan of Gladwell's writings, and this one did not disappoint. Readable, and eye-opening as usual, this book shows us a different way of looking at things we thought we understood.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Great acting and an interesting look at the making of one of Hitchcock's best films.  Hopkins and Mirren are worth watching no matter what they do.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Fits perfectly and holds.  Unlike others I think the cord is long enough for my needs since I wouldn't use it while plugged in anyway.
B008602KQI|4.0|Pretty true to the book.  In all ways.  Liked the actors.  She has a great smile and he is pretty cool
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Very challenging, I like that puts me to think which buttons to cut first.<br />Sometimes is very difficult to put it down, just like a great puzzle.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|I found the game to be only blah.  I ended up uninstalling it just because it didn't amuse me enough to want to keep it.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best series that I've seen. Claire Danes is superb, quite a powerful actress, but us not forget Mandy Patikin!!! When you think you know where the plot is going -- bong -- it turns on you and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I gave this 5 stars as, while it's not exactly &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; it was not &#34;Mission Impossible 9&#34; either.  The &#34;hook&#34; or big idea of the movie is engaging and reasonably original.  Morgan Freeman actually plays a character who is not just Morgan Freeman.  These days it is great to be able to watch a movie and say &#34;that was fun&#34; instead of &#34;Oh, man, that was sure a waste of time&#34;.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Excellent CPU cooler. I was having problems with my OEM cooler, wasn't getting the job done. I stalled this and no more crashes due to heat.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Great movie. Pretty good plot very funny and light watching. Love this kind of movie where you don't have to think too much and enjoy the show. Jeff Bridges is always good for a laugh.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Lindsey Mendez is such a powerful singer and Miss Mauzey is so darn kooky cute! The whole cast has pizzazz and some great lessons are taught!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is truly an epic tale in that it is a complex tale, that spans a huge stage, many, many characters, is filled with action, has numerous plots and sub plots, and is long.  Very, very long.  This is the second volume in the series, the first being GAME OF THRONES, and the series truly must be read in order.  The first book was over 800 pages long, this one over 700 pages.  At times, the sheer weight of the book became an issue during a prolonged reading session.<br /><br />The plot in this volume picks up shortly after the events of the previous novel.  Winter is indeed coming and the children of the House of Stark are scattered, each facing their own perils.  Their stories, combined with those of other characters are the points of view that are offered in this volume.  As in Game of Thrones, the story is told from various points of view, each section moving the narrative forward, then, often abruptly shifting to another character, usually in a distant location.  This technique is very effective for telling such a sprawling tale but at times it is quite frustrating to be so abruptly torn away from a character to begin another story.  Even after plowing through 700 pages the various plot lines are not resolved, only altered.<br /><br />The series is currently projected to run at least seven volumes long, with five of those volumes already available.  This represents a big investment in time to complete the series but it is well worth the effort.  Unlike many fantasy writers Martin has made the effort to create fully realized characters rather than the usual one dimensional good guys and bad guys that so often are found in this genre.  The problems facing these characters are not the single object quest that, once accomplished, will solve all the problems, but rather the more realistic complex issues that often only reveal additional problems when they are resolved.
B008602KQI|4.0|Better than most. It did have a teeny-bopper feel to it, but a good movie all and all. I recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was a skeptic, couldn't figure out the attraction, but every episode hooks me more.  What fun this series is.
0761171703|5.0|Every page in this wonderful  book is brimming with talented dancers, exciting, energetic, creative poses and excellent photography! Super fun!
0385743564|4.0|I copy a copy of this book through the Amazon Vine program for review.  It was a very well done science fiction/post-apocalyptic/dystopia/superhero type of read.  I enjoyed it, but still enjoy Sanderson’s fantasy book quite a bit more.<br /><br />Ten years ago Calamity came and gave certain men and women extraordinary powers.  These men and women are called Epics and they didn’t use their powers for good, but to enslave and control the rest of humanity.  David is an ordinary boy who lives in a city ruled by the Epic called Steelheart.  Steelheart killed David’s father but right before that David’s father did the unthinkable and made Steelheart bleed.  Now David wants to take Steelheart down, but in order to do that he needs to be accepted into the Reckoners.  The Reckoners are a rebel group intent on killing all Epics.<br /><br />This is a well done super hero/post-apocalyptic/dystopia book.  The whole classification of Epic powers is very Sanderson, it is very detailed and somewhat complex.  Also with the Epics there is one rule, every Epic has a weakness.  The problem is finding out that weakness.<br /><br />The book is very fast-paced and there is a lot of action and fighting.  David works right from the beginning to become part of the Reckoners.  After he meets up with the Reckoners it is one mission after another to take down certain Epics.  All of this is leading to the big showdown between the Reckoners and Steelheart.<br /><br />The world building is well done and very dystopia like.  Basically humans are all subjects of Steelheart and make their livelihoods at his whim.  Some humans live underground and off the grid.  The whole city is made of Steel after Steelheart turned it that way.  Also the city is eternally in darkness because of one of Steelhearts enforcers who has used his power over darkness to block out the sun.<br /><br />David is a decent character but I had some trouble engaging with him.  His one goal in life is to destroy Epics, particularly Steelheart.  He has no goals or considerations outside of that.  He is an absolute fountain of random Epic information.  However, he is hard to relate to because he just hasn’t done anything except for plan to kill Epics.  He does grow some as a character as the story continues and I hope in future books he becomes easier to engage with.<br /><br />We meet a number of other characters among the Reckoners.  They are all a bit stereotypical.  You have the Professor, who plans things.  A comic-relief guy and a girl who is mysterious and deadly and has secrets.<br /><br />We meet a ton of Epics as well.  They are somewhat interesting, but their weaknesses are all a bit random (and at times kind of corny).  For example there is an Epic who can only be hurt by someone who is 37 years old.<br /><br />The whole deal with this story is to try and piece together how the Reckoners are going to take down Steelheart before they do it.  The whole time you are trying to guess and piece together whose weakness is what and unravel all the secrets of the Reckoners before Sanderson spells it out for you.<br /><br />Overall an interesting start to a new superhero based dystopian young adult series.  I honestly like Sanderson's fantasy better.  I thought these characters were a bit hard to engage with, partly because we meet so many characters.  The Epics were a bit corny in very super-villain like ways, but still interesting.  It’s a fun read and there’s some good world-building here.  The system of Epics powers is very Sanderson in the way it is explained and classified.<br /><br />I would recommend to those who love reading about superheroes.  At times this reminded me a bit of Peter Clines Ex-Heroes series, except everyone who has super powers is bad in this book and there aren’t any zombies.  I will definitely read the next book in the series, Firefight.cularly Steelheart.  He has no goals or considerations outside of that.  He is an absolute fountain of random Epic information.

B0060D0OWA|4.0|I liked this movie is theaters even though others thought is wasn't that hot.  No I agree it's not great but the music is some of the best I'd heard in a while and really drives the movie forward.  I think Gyllenhaal does a great job and there is chemistry between the two main characters.  Ben Kingsley is a great villain and the Hassanssins are a great too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank God finally candy crush for kindle fire!  Love this game on my cell. Really enjoy on the kindle.  Please continue to get all android games.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|both my 6 year old and myself enjoy this. Easy to learn. Not very spooky, but really cute. Give it a try.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book really kept me going, especially in the last half.  Loved having more of the tech guys in the book.  It brings the book more up to date with the current threats of the world.  Clancy fans will not be disappointed. Can't wait for the last Clancy book to come out.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|I've like One Republic for awhile but always bought their singles, never the full album. Everyone knows the game, buy the album and more often than not you only liked the one song you looked for in the first place. This time I saw the album was only $6 so I figured I'd give it a try. So happy I did. One of the best albums I've bought this year. I like every song. This may make me go back and get every one of their previous albums I never wanted to gamble on.
B0037QO8RK|5.0|Precious is one of the greatest dramas of our time and is sure to be a classic. A modern, urbanized Color Purple, the main character starts out as a victim that eventually finds strength and courage in friendship and love. The acting is incredible. Monique portrays a mother that lives on the system and allows her daughter to be raped repeatedly and impregnated by her spouse (Precious' own father). Her mother grows strong feelings of resentment towards her daughter, blaming her for the actions of &#34;her man&#34;. Precious' mother abuses her in every way. Monique's performance is incredible and exquisitely showcases her talent. Gabourey Sidibe is also a gifted actress. She flawlessly plays the part of Precious and as the character undergoes change, Sidibe instills hope and triumph. She shows how one should never judge. Precious is afraid to open up to people about her situation at first  and comes across as rude and indignant. The viewer gets a sneak peak into her soul with Sadibe's voice over. The actress is able to transition effortlessly.<br />Mariah Carey is also great in her role, a social worker for the department of social services. The students and teacher also give great performances and help us to understand how the system treats people and how welfare is a form of enslavement.<br />Set in the late 80's it also shows how little things have changed and how the system remains broken
B004DLPXAO|5.0|the product met the expectations, the product is very very nice, only a little problem in windows systems's 64 bits, excelent in  Android and iphone, the product is very good
B00F91H666|3.0|Action was great, lots of suspense.  I'm just not a huge fan of horror films so I couldn't give this more stars.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|It was fine. Not as good as the Iron Man movies.  Entertaining if you've got nothing better to do.  Booyah.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was totally fascinating. I have always believed in near death experiences anyway, but to have this account from a brain surgeon who had always been a skeptic and knew how the brain functions was amazing. He is absolutely positive his experience was real. That he lived to tell about it after having this deadly, fatal disease was unbelievable! I will probably reread it cause I'm sure I missed things along the way. It will make a believer out of anyone!!
B000003S0B|5.0|Of course we all know the Court of the Crimson King (Ahhh ahh ahh...), but there's more trippy mythologically inspired goodies to enjoy herein! So &#34;long ago, so freaky&#34; genre. No autotune, no overproduction, no dancing, just that thing we called music. Just groove.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|better than anything!  its really fun as you learn, best of all it free, there isn't any dumb apps, there's nothing better, who would pay twenty dollars on something else?
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Best take on the Zombie thing, great story line, specifically how the disease affects the populace. one thing that stood out and almost ruined the movie; why would a seasoned and, supposedly expertly trained operative go into a silent combat situation with a phone's ringer on full sound. This doesn't happen, at all, ever, not funny... not smart...
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|First of all, this book was SO GOOD! SO GOOD! I read 3 FANTASTIC books this weekend & this was the third. There are no words to describe how closely I could relate to Eleanor. I don't remember anyone ever taking my things, but people did torment me they way she was tormented at school. It sucked so bad! I had a bad home life too, not in the same way as Eleanor, but it wasn't the best.<br /><br />I loved Park! He was such a sweet & gentle person. I loved his heart & the way he thought about Eleanor. I loved the way Rainbow wrote this story & the way she wrote out the thought process of Park. It was exactly how you feel as a teenager. You don't know if what you are saying or doing is the right thing or not or how the other person feels.<br /><br />This book was AWESOME! I absolutely LOVED IT
1582406723|5.0|Amazing start to a series that grips you even more than the TV show. Great story, awesome action, twists and turns every issue!

B002SSUQFG|3.0|Looks great. Like that the band is a woven Nylon. Only giving 3 stars since you have to wear it all the time to keep it wound. I took it off last night when I got home last night around 7 or 8. When I put it back on this morning around 7:30 it had already stopped. I will have to get one of those autowinder watch cases to keep from having to adjust it everyday. I like it though.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I absolutely love the app! It woke me up, you can change the color theme and much more that want in an alarm clock! This app is wonderful!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I bought it for a Christmas gift but it arrived in plenty of time. I have not opened it since it is a gift.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Very good story. Even made the big people cry. Loved the premise of this movie. Glad that Pixar did this film
B00BD99JMW|4.0|So many mixed feelings about this book.  It's well written and I love the author's writing style.  it was realistic in terms of people actually dying in a battle situation.  that being said, who kills off their main character like that? It was weird how Tris just disappeared and we didn't hear anything more from her.  That left me dissatisfied.  I'm all for closure and realistic endings, but I am so emotionally tied to my main characters I could never off one of them.  even though I have a bitter taste in my mouth for the way it ended, the Divergent trilogy is still on my shelf next to Harry Potter, Twilight, Hush, Hush, and Mortal Instruments.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I haven't played another robot battle game like this. The graphics are super, reaction time great and it just makes you wanna. Keep playing. In a word...Addictive!
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|WOTE is a great success story of new media for musicians. They are helping to usher in a new generation of internet celebrity.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book is incredibly interesting.  I really enjoyed the read and plan to use my new skills to manipulate everyone around me, be they friend or foe.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Exciting game to play,but slow  to level up. Besides that my kid and I enjoy logging in everyday . Wish we could make more money!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is an OK game... I would've rated this better if there were no ads during the game and better controls.FIX IT! I would rate this game 3 out of 5 stars... In my opinion... don't waste ALL of YOU'RE time on this semifun game... I would rather delete this game.
0062183613|1.0|I regret buying this book. I would have rather gone to the beach, or done anything else, even the dishes.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and addictive, but it can easily get costly. Although the game it free, you can buy extra lives and boosters to help get through the levels. The higher you go, the harder it becomes to get through the levels without paying for help.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|I thought this was a fascinating book. You get an insiders view of how the Beatles songs came together technically, politically, and creatively. It has great details on the inner politics of their teamwork and the songs they created. I still go back and reference it for research.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Classic King -- grabs & holds interest; characters are a bit simplistic but move through the story in an interesting, even if bizarre or unnatural, manner.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Awesome! I want a sequel!!! I haven't read the book, but I loved the storyline...it kept me intrigued throughout with just the right amount of action and unknown
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Interesting. Took me a while to get used to the setting, but once in, I was hooked.<br />Really a nice story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game forever. i have been playing this game on other people's phones and been waiting for it. so fun everyone will love it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I didn't think I would put this much time into a game like this, I'll tell you buy this game. there are plenty of Good reviews so I will put my 2 cents. I have this on my tablet and on my phone and it&quot;s flawless.<br /><br />Flying cross country this is the game out of all of them that kept me busy
B0094M4O3O|5.0|Very inspirational, would be nice to use as a teaching tool.  Has an excellent lesson, people should learn from this movie.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book gave me insight into dealing with remorse, mortality, loss of loved ones, growing old, feeling like a failure. Life's greatest battles are waged within the self. Life's a bitch and then you die. Seek comfort from those around you. We only have each other.
1476704163|4.0|It is a good companion to her documentary &#34;My Crazy Beautiful Life&#34;.<br />This book has pretty pictures and very informative perspective into a very important &#34;stage&#34; in her life.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this series.  It is smartly written and the acting is superb!  Don't miss it!  Come on Season 5!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King could write a story about anything and you won't be able to put it down.  Great idea to bring back Dan Torrance and see how his life turned out.  Looking forward to a third sequel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the check the weather through out the day.  This is a great app to keep you abreast of what is going on in your area.<br />Love it!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book reinforces the results of Thomas Seifried's book on cancer as a metabolic disease. Cut the carbs and live longer and more comfortably.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|A perfect story. A work of art. I will miss - the mood of it, the many life questions it asks and, of course, the characters namely Theo, Hobie and Boris. It is a long story that will take awhile to read, yet for the last quarter you will be torn between wanting to know what will happen, and being sad that the story is going to end.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did enjoy this book. It was an easy read and grabbed your attention, but the ending felt like she just ran out if paper to type on.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Nice app, it has a wide selection,  but it would prefer it with ratings of the content. It is difficult to choose and trust.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|.<br />AT FIRST I WAS NOT TOO THRILLED WITH THE STORY BUT AS I CONTINUED IT REALLY BECAME COMPELLING.  I GUESS I JUST FIGURED ON A DIFFERENT ENDING, HOWEVER, ON A WHOLE IT WAS A GREAT BOOK
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Much of this book is logical supposition. Factual information on individual persons not specifically recorded by the Romans is<br />scarce in this era. What Azlan presents makes sense, but is still open to interpretation.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It was very engrossing & I looked forward to each episode. I liked the weekly -plot<br />& the story line running thru it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The author explains the impact of established Roman and Jewish power upon the events leading to the crucifixion and uses highly readable and understandable prose to make a strong case for his interpretation of the historical Jesus. The author also highlights how the religion of Paul may conflict with the religion of the early Christians in Jerusalem, such as the Apostles Peter and James, the brother of Jesus.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hannibal is an amazin and intense thriller full of awesome and creepy music and imagery. Truly a fan couldnt ask for more than this.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book. It is emotional, suspenseful, and engaging. It is a little confusing in the beginning trying to keep all the different characters and their stories straight, but keep reading, it all comes together in the end, with a deeper meaning and message. I was tempted to draw a map to keep track of the connections between all the characters, and I wish I would've. From the second I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh out loud, smile, cry, and gasp. So we'll-written. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|Be very clear before you purchase this that this is not the Paramore you know.  This is Hayley Williams' debut solo album.  Riot! in my opinion was one of the best punk/rock/whatever you want to call it albums ever made. Having said that, this new album is not bad.  Hayley obviously wanted a different direction and she does it here.  It is much more reminiscent of No Doubt's ska pop sound.  It is most definitely not a set you'd expect to hear on the Vans Warped tour.  Riot! was perfection for me, and for many fans.  A shame the band members couldn't get through their 'teen and early 20s' angst and keep things going musically.  Here's to hope that in about five years or so they'll get back together and get back to the basics which made Paramore so incredibly popular in the first place.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! Actually the whole series!! So much character growth. I am amazed at the awesome job that the author had done on this book. There was never a dull moment. I laughed, I cried, and I got angry. I could not put this book down. It was that good! I am happy I gave this series a chance because I was not disappointed. It is bittersweet that they have come to an end, but honestly, I could not ask for a better ending. After reading the Allegiant by Veronica Roth and was subjected to that awful ending, The Sentinel by Jennifer Armentrout more than made up for it.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|One of the best seasons yet full of action and events that set revenge of the sith in motion. Amazing animation and storyline as well as the duels are intense.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great Batman movie.  Nice to be able to order a blu ray copy.  Good quality and good theme.  Loved this movie.  Thank you.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Great book. This young woman is getting what she wants a good education but at a price. But she is also educating the world in the process. She is wiser beyond her years. I can definitely see her winning the Nobel Peace Prize and it would be well deserved. &#34;I am Malala!&#34;
B006LSZECO|2.0|I prefer to read a novel where I actually like one or more of the main characters.  I did not like, nor feel any sympathy for, either of the main characters in this book.  It was an interesting writing style, but not one that I found that captured my interest.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was a wonderful story! I actually sobbed out loud, wiggled in distress, and cried true tears. I laughed out loud (much to the surprise of the folks next to me on the bus!) As Gaiman does so often, it was like reading a fairytale - an ancient old story that has always been here we had just never heard it. Good for all ages. Incredible vocabulary. I can't recommend it enough.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read that I could not tear myself away from. Another phenomenal book with a look into history of the south.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|Ever since I saw the extended version on television i've wanted to have a DVD of it. Can't wait to collect them all. Can't say i'm crazy about the books and cards that come with it. That makes the package bulkier (oh, well).
B004AGI2L4|5.0|Not cliche like most Roman War movies. Great actors, good story line untouched by other movies.<br />Unfiltered war scenes for those who like the real raw action<br />Great shoot locations as well. Amazing scenery.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Excellent book and a great read, everyone should read this to better understand the region and people of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Don't bother with the five and ten squares, unless you want to do a few practices first.  Skip directly to the fifteen squares - they are enjoyable but not overly difficult.  All can be solved with logic.  The fives and tens are way too easy, but the main reason to skip them is that the same scenes are re-used for each level (the reason for nicking one star).  Otherwise a lot of fun.  I was sorry to reach the end and I'm still debating whether or not I want to give the game a Facebook shout out to unlock the bonus round.  I don't normally mix gaming and FB...
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|I may not be the best critic here because David and Hope cannot make a bad record together if they tried ..<br />That's a weird way to say i am a huge Mazzy Star fan  and was thrilled to hear of the new  release.
B000SW16NU|5.0|Saw this one twice a while back. Excellent story line depicting historic events.<br />Not necessarily meant to glorify this time but tells a romantic/action tale of this historic era.<br />Even for those of us who don't agree with religions, this makes for a good action movie.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It is very slow at first. Honestly I hated it in the beginning. Was really bored. But as the chapters progress the story picks up pace.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If you remove it from your device and download it should work better. It should also automatically update itself as well.
B00G32OER4|5.0|great for scary movie night, not gory, but frightening none the less, I think this was based loosely on a true story which adds an extra bit of creep to it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun I look forward to more new levels!  I enjoy it as much as angry birds....<br />I will recommend this game to my friends.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Monsters University had a good plot.  It had all the favorite characters from Monsters, Inc. and also a few new fun characters.  We loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Umm, it's Candy Crush, one of the most addictive games, like, ever! And it's on your Kindle to play whenever you want. Do you need another reason to get this? If so, you don't need to get this. For the other 99% of us, click on &#34;Yes&#34; and &#34;Join Us!&#34;
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This is a great book to read even when you don't have time to read a book. Easy read that made me laugh out loud. I recommend this book to my friends.
B00CUKTGJO|5.0|Still the best band to have ever existed on this planet.nothing will ever compare to the sound that the Clash created.<br />RIP Joe.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|For some reason, after downloading the game, I get an error message saying that Magic 2014 can't be installed. Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;. Yet?
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I grew up enjoying Japanese anime which defenders of the Earth fight against galactic invaders. Often the highlight of the show was the wham-slam between a towering mecha and a marauding monster. &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; brings back the excitement of these stories, with modern CG wizardry upping the oomph.<br /><br />I also appreciate the human elements of the story. It reminds me of those old Westerns in w/c the reluctant-hero finds redemption in his inner demons through his struggle against the bad guys. &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; appeared to be following this morality tale, until the big-screen fights took over and ran with the film all the way to the end. I wish the film brought the inner-conflicts of the Jaeger pilots to a close, but then maybe this overshot the film's budget ... or maybe this was held off until the sequel.<br /><br />*Really, really* looking forward to the follow up!
B005VSRFEA|4.0|I need time to process and reread parts. Everyone should read the book because we are all effected by systems thinking and most of the time we think about it in the wrong way.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This makes a Maglite much quicker to use when needed. Very simple upgrade installation. Note that turning the light beam bezel all the way down will still turn off the flashlight.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|From my Kindle Fire HDX this doesn't post to the account I've selected to use in the app when I share from the browser and doesn't let me choose which account to post to during the sharing process either. That feature works OK on my other Android devices, though. I hope for improvements soon! Also, I can't get this app to stop notifications on any of my devices lately, from within the app or device settings or any combination thereof (while notifications are off on Twitter itself already).
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I find this game addictive! My daughter loves it as well. It is a great game for a long car ride.
0345803493|5.0|awesome! It was clean just like they said it would be! I really enjoyed the first one so I had to purchase this one! So far so good!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|this game is fun but there are difficult levels where you have little control over your own success. for example when you need to drop a certain number of fruit to the bottom and the last one doesn't show up till you have 1 move left. there are not enough lives for this situation so I cant keep playing even when I want to. very frustrating not to be able to play when I have the time available to play.!!!!!!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|saw this in the theater but love to see it again and again so like to have my copy to watch when I want to
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Loved this movie when it came out years ago.  I now watch it with my Grandkids<br />on Halloween , lots of fun , even better now.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I am very frustrated with this app. Lately it has been deleting all my events. I just grabbed my Kindle to add in another event and when I opened Calengoo, I realized all my events were deleted AGAIN. I will be uninstalling this app now.
B004WY1FJK|5.0|My favorite cookie book.  Make sure you follow the recipes exactly for best results.  My paper copy is so beat up.  Just downloaded the Kindle edition.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|great service but the movie was not what I expected your service was great but my sister said great movie so had to get it and watch it but narrated movie not my kind of movie but your service was great thanks
B004DK5CYM|5.0|The will power to believe in your dreams when all others doubt you is so powerful.<br />The power of you dreams will remove things that block your success.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|These are some adorable and happy cheering red creatures in this app. I loved that the little cheering squad was there with applause as positive reinforcement when letters or animals shapes were put together correctly, and even if a mistake was made the friendly beep/horn sound served as encouragement to try again. What an exciting way to learn ABC's and shapes. Technology is here to stay so it's great that there are interactive apps that make learning fun.  I used to put money for my young nieces and nephews in their piggy banks, it was my way to encourage them to save and think about their future.  I have now begun to purchase these affordable apps from 22LEARN. I know the importance of fostering a lifelong love of learning in young people.  Warning: Corny story coming ahead.  I will never forget when I was in the sixth grade and I won the book report contest at school. The positive reaction that I received from my family and teachers encouraged my lifelong love of learning. I believe these apps will do the same for my nieces and nephews.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|I have been a huge Korn fan since the beginning.  I've been a little let down with the past 2-3 cds, but this one has re-captured my love for this band.  Has a lot of drive to it and reminds me of some of their older stuff.  Highly recommend.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Haven't had any problems on my Kindle Fire normal. It has awesome features like charge/usage graph and time left in battery if you play games/use GPS etc. A must-have.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Interesting read the world created was novel and fun. The writing style was fluid and descriptive without taking away from the main story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love the Chromecast! I watch Netflix all the time through it. My only complaint is I wish they had more applications supported but I hear its coming soon. The picture quality is amazing and its really easy to setup and figure out. Everything works as promised so far! For the price..its awesome!
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Hard to say, but it was just too hectic and weird.  I did like the ongoing homages, etc.  Good but not great.  I guess this new franchise shares the same even numbered movies curse as the original.  So I look forward to number 3.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book is great because it keeps you in suspense from page one to finish. I found it very difficult to put it down.<br /><br />In summary, to anyone looking for a good book loaded with suspense. I would recommend this one for sure.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like that I can sit and do more than just play cards while I am waiting for different things; doctors, kids, whatever!!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Excellent treatise on processed foods and the lengths the industry will go to hook us. I will not be able to shop in the grocery store anymore without thinking of this book.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|Good game but it needs updates I want the hover craft, and the other things from the update. Good game though
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Enjoyed the game, pretty good graphics needs other ways to get energy up so can hunt more!!! Lots of live action!!  Whoowhoowhoo!!! CWB1987
B00E8B1358|3.0|Good action combined with boring and confusing motives and dialog. Looks like two movies combined, one fantastic with great special effects and one boring and clueless. Maybe it is a historical reference to comic book history or something
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Love it! Definitely more mature, but like every good band they evolve and grow into better things. It's called experimenting. Love them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a very fun way to pass the time  but they want you to spend money on the special minions so they don't give very many tokens
B007NESBK2|4.0|saw it live had it to have it for the house. Even better sound quality than previous live performances of hers I've seen on DVD. Dont think it was because it was the bluray version.
B0045HCJSK|1.0|Video was described as new, however, the disc was damaged and would not play the entire movie.  Would like to return for refund.
B002G917ZK|1.0|Anti-feminist message. The basic message is, women are whores unless they can find a man to love and take care of them. I'm sad for this story
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is hilarious. I loved that it was told in Drew's perspective. I don't think I've ever read a romance novel that was completely in the Hero's perspective. Emma Chase is extremely talented. I can't wait to read the follow-up.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Expected it to work on all HDMI capable tvs but surprisingly a 3 year old Vizio wasnt having it. I tried both Vizio support and Google support. Neither group found a solution. Still give it 4 stars since it works like a charm on the other tvs. like others waiting patiently for true dlna support so i can stream from local computer.
B000066SBB|5.0|Im in my early forties and want to have some good R & B classic music in my collection! Aretha's voice is awesome!
B000I9YWDO|2.0|I've been hearing about what a hysterically funny movie this is for years, but I didn't care for it. Actually fell asleep twice and didn't even watch the end of it. Maybe I'm burnt out on &#34;bad boss revenge&#34; movies.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I've had these for about 1 year now and they are phenomenal! mic is great quality for gamers, sound is great and never goes down in quality. the only note i have that has happened with many people i have seen with these is the adjustable part near the top breaks if you use it to heavily/drop it. otherwise, great headset, looks great and overall is a great product for the price (obviously not as good as studio ones, but getting there) and I would reccomend this to gamers and listeners alike!
B002M85TH2|3.0|Ok movie with excitement and some great lines. Make sure the kids are in bed when you watch this though
147676459X|5.0|I love love love love this webcomic, and the book is just more awesome. If you find her writing honest and relatable, and let's not lie, everyone does, this is something you need to have with you at all times.
B000W74EQC|4.0|It play great and I got right on time<br />I was satisfied with my purchase. I would shop a gain
B000QE9ERK|1.0|Flat, boring, ridiculous...waste of time.  The only reason I finished watching it was because I thought something might happen.  Don't bother.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Me and my family are a big fan of Lindsey Stirling. My wife found her on You Tube with the Zelda Melody video and then I found her playing with the Piano Guys and we fell in love. She is an inspiration to my 8 year old daughter who has been learning the violin for the past two years.
B0014JPZJM|5.0|i love this set its big but its worth getting for any fantasia fan it has two vhs tapes two cds a litho and other things i recamend getting it at the low price
B002M9WW30|5.0|I found the Rocky .. sorry the UNDISPUTED Rockey collection to be a great purchase.  I picked it up as the deal of the day a while back and recently re-watched all of the Rockey goodness that I grew up loving.<br /><br />The transfer to BluRay is pretty solid compared to most transfers that I've seen, so the quality is worth it.  I had never seen Balboa and figured this set would be a perfect way to complete my Rocky viewing saga.<br /><br />After watching 1 a week for the past 6 weeks I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed the trip back down memory lane.  Whether he's fighting Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, or Tommy Gunn Rocky will take you on an underdog's journey to glory!<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movies before, they're 70's & 80's movies, so that should give you an idea of what to expect.  They are all written by Sly Stone himself so if you enjoy his career but haven't seen these movies, give them a chance.<br /><br />&#34;I must break you!&#34; --&#62; Drago!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Always enjoy hearing these guys' renditions of all genres of music. Skillfully and beautifully played pieces! Highly recommend for inspiration to keep practicing!
B00E1LQ7Q0|4.0|the cd was okay, not as good as i expected but did receive it in good time and in excellent condition as always.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A real fun way to pass some time. I really enjoy it. I play it just about every day. The only way to have more fun would be to actually eat candy!
B008G12ERC|5.0|I love every song on this album, each one borrows from a different genre but retains the awesome Muse sound. Lyrically, the choruses get a little repetitive (Follow Me! Hear Me! Save Me! Free Me!), and Survival starts off well but doesn't really go anywhere new. The underlying themes of entropy and thermodynamics are pure nerd candy also.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I think NCIS is the best show to come on television in many years. When it's not Tuesday night to watch the newest episode, I pop in a DVD & can watch for hours.
B00CT2P6VA|2.0|too easy - I was hoping for more puzzling , mind boggling and challenging.<br />It is entertaining though and not a complete waste of 1.99
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Fun, action-packed, witty and smart! I only wished it had been longer! But I suppose that is what sequels are for.
B002RXMG00|5.0|I first saw Psycho over 40 years ago and decided to rent it in HD after watching the 2013 Hitchcock movie staring Anthony Hopkins. I recommend watching both movies to get the background of what went into making the original 1960 classic.<br />This was also the first time I rented a movie from Amazon to watch through our PS3 and the quality of the movie was fantastic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am a big fan of solitaire games and Spider is a favorite! Very easy to play considering it is a touch screen game.  If you like the mouse play version then you will like this touch screen version as well!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Had a few good moments. Nothing overly spectacular. As far as zombie movies go, not my favorite but worth watching once.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am not a big zombie, vampire or monster show fan. The acting is supurb and the writing is very good. The sets are great too.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Hours of fun. Frustrating at times, but never ever boring. Great graphics, and neat ways to make you think logically.
0385537131|5.0|This was an excellent book. It kept the reader very interested and lots of twist and turns in the book. The book was written very well and as always he is one of the best writers that I have read. His books are always written well. Great plot and it was page turner book.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Cute not one I will spend much time on but has some fun trates.  You will get some great time killed with it and the kids will love it but don't expect hours of fun.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Fantastic!<br /><br />All you need to know about negotiating.<br /><br />A simple easy read on how to make good deals and not get scammed.<br /><br />A must for anyone in the Australian construction industry.<br /><br />A must read for both your professional and private life.<br /><br />Evan Corbett,<br /><br />Construction Solutions Online,<br /><br />Australia.
B005VPRG10|5.0|I bought this Lego set for my niece's birthday (who says teenage girl's can't have a Star Wars obsession also?). She really loves the set and it looks great assembled. I didn't put it together, obviously since that would be terrible of me...no matter how much I was tempted to). She said it was great though and it seems to fit together really well.<br /><br />Just as a note, this does not contain a Darth Vader figure in it. I could have sworn the picture showed him in it, but it's actually a stormtrooper.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved the first season and had to continue watching.  I will be order the third season as well.  Such a crazy plot!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a very fun game to play, and based on how much I like Bejeweled, I decided to give Candy Crush a try.  Besides what could I lose since it was free!<br /><br />What I did not like was that it kept asking for .99 cents as you reached different levels, if you wanted to keep playing.  So free was kind of just a come-on.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|WONDERFUL CD, WONDERFUL GROUP. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE WONDERFULLY WRITTEN. I LOVE THIS GROUP AND THEIR MUSIC. ZAC'S GIFT OF SONGWRITING IS AMAZING.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This was a great movie !  Any dog lovers out there,.....you will enjoy this movie, which is based on a true story.  Also a plus is no bad language, so it is a family-friendly movie.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This level 181 is Not fun....when it is almost impossible to reach the goal, it holds no interest or motivation to continue on.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List is a movie that will bring you to tears, make you angry and also slightly thankful that there were some good during the evil that ruled in War World II. The movie gives us an idea of what kind of suffering Jews went through during Hitler's rule. They were first forced to move out of their homes and live in \\"Ghettos\\" communities of Jews that were under strict rule and unfit living conditions. They had to give up their belongings and slave away at work without any compensation. Schindler was a popular, good looking and successful businessman who was part of the Nazi Party, but he didn't share the belief of killing off the Jewish population. He had Jewish workers and although he socialized with the cruel Nazi leaders he didn't want to see his employees or innocent people killed. Schindler watched when the Ghetto was being destroyed, soldiers were marching down the streets, through neighborhoods shooting down people. Innocent Jews, men, women and children were terrified and some tried to hide but were not successful, entire families were brutally shut down. Schindler watched a little girl in a red coat (while the movie is in black and white) run. He later saw the red coat on a little body lying dead on a pile of bodies. I think this red represented all the blood from the genocide. Schindler bribed the officer in charge of the camp, Goeth, to keep \\"his\\" Jews as workers so he can keep his company working. But in reality he couldn't stand to see those get killed. In the camps Jews are treated inhumanely, starved, ridiculed, and made to be terrified not knowing when the officers will shoot them. They had to be stripped down naked in front of everyone and separated from sufficient to work or not in which case were sent off to death camps. Children, elderly and sick were automatically sent off to die. When they started being sent off to Auschwitz Schindler made a list of over 1000 people, Jews that he wanted as his workers out of the camps and in his factory.He gave up all the money and wealth he had to save those people. He had just enough money to save them until the war was over. This movie showed how quickly things escalated from Jews not being liked to them being stripped off their belongings, family, health, food, water and life. These people were educated, some wealthy some just normal people with families and within days they were removed from life as they knew it and became prisoners, slaves. The movie starts off with a family lighting candles for Jewish holiday and ends with Schindler encouraging celebrating the Sabbath. There were also Jewish songs during the movie. The movie touched me even more because they mentioned my birth country Yugoslavia. I could understand most of what was said when they didn't speak English. Everyone should watch this movie to realize what Jews went through.
0452289963|2.0|Actually listened to this on an audiobook. The author's constant droning voice kept putting me to sleep.<br />He does make some valid points however.
B009NX1YT6|3.0|Fun and memorable music. Great tunes that even my kids can sing and dance along. A fun walk down memory lane.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Great Rocket sim with an easy learning curve.  If you're a KSP fan, then you'll love this app. Get it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I actually haven't had the time to watch it yet but everyone I know has assured me that I will love it!  I'm very much a Lincoln freak and I know they're right.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loved the movies. This game really does have a lot of entertainment value! And it seems to be easy enough for all ages too!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Strange. Disturbing and disjointed. Beautiful cinematography. Artistic and surreal. Decent acting but complicated plots with dark subject matter. Would have preferred a simpler story.
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|I didn't think I was old until I saw this movie, but the drug use and constant sex was repulsive.  This is from a guy that is VERY progressive.  I kept thinking, if my little boys saw this I wouldn't be happy with what they were seeing.  Yes, it's comedy, got it.  Yes, it's entertainment, got it.  But it could have been just as funny without cocaine and constant filth.  I know, I know...probably the only guy in the US that thinks like this anymore.  But...I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone...and yes, I sound old.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I'm a grandma and am used to having all the possible children's DVDs for my grandkids.  I did not have this one and purchased it. I decided to watch it with one of my grandchildren and decided that it was one of the best ever - the music, the plot and the &#34;actors&#34; are great - and FYI, I'm very Caucasian with a very inter-racial family.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Very good.  I love that Brandon Sanderson finished the series.  He made the characters really come to life in the last few books.  That is very true in this book.  It has the perfect amount of action to keep you interested (as long as you don't mind A LOT of battle scenes), and finishes up the series in a satisfying way.  I am so happy to be finished with the Wheel of Time Series!  I loved the whole thing, but have been waiting for each new book since The Path of Daggers.  It's very gratifying to finally be able to finish reading the series.  Also, thanks to Brandon Sanderson's finishing the Wheel of Time series, I've gotten sucked into Brandon Sanderson's own books.  I think I have a new favorite author!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Lots of detail over a long span of time.  But given the amazing overall success of the US nuclear program, it is truly unbelieveable that we got away without a bomb exploding accidentally or that a war wasn't started accidentally.  A good case can be made for &#34;devine&#34; intervention as the only explanation as to why MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) did not incerate the whole damn planet..  I worked ICBM sites back in the 60's as a young technician, this book describes what I saw back then as potential disaster in the making.  If for no other reason, the details surrounding the Titan II accident in Arkansas is worth the read.  Good book
B000FC12SM|5.0|Great book. Classic read. I haven't finished it yet, but I really did enjoy as far as I got. I bought it on my kindle & it's great to pick up every once in a while.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a good app with many different games to choose. from I would reccomened it. It's fun entertaining and also a challenge :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I luv this game since I got can't get off also my friends in Facebook help me and also I give them life Thank you :)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|An interesting little device! Did a couple of things I didn't expect it &#34;could&#34; do (i.e., casting a Youtube video from a device, then being able to search for another Youtube video while the first one is still playing on the TV).<br /><br />Was very easy to set up in Windows 7, and XP (even though there was a warning that XP might not work). It was a bit more tricky to get my Samsung Galaxy Note II to work, but eventual I got it working. I haven't tired it on my Windows 8 of iPAD yet.<br /><br />The device is small and is made well (feels like quality construction).
B000JQUKKU|4.0|Classic and timeless story. Can't get any better than Dickens. Free buy around Christmas-time, so definitely a great buy for then.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My great grandson loves this seat.  He is five months old, and can barely touch the floor to bounce.  However, when he gets going, he can really bounce.  He loves the music also, and keeps busy for a long time.  Great interest for baby.  I would recommend it highly.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I read this book in less than a day and I can not wait for January 2014 and number 4. Already pre-ordered.
B00EDX5QRW|5.0|Bad ass album... Loved it so much that I had to add it too my vinyl collection! Strongly encourage anyone else who likes KoL to do the same!
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Second time I have seen this series, this one is a classic,it will never be outdated anytime soon. Great purchase price as we'll .
1451666179|5.0|I recently found Hyperbole and a Half's online blog and devoured the entire website in under a week.  I was so excited when I found out her book was about to be published, and I quickly pre-ordered it.  I was not disappointed!  Her dog stories make me cry every. single. time., and her blogs about depression are poignant and informative without being preachy.  I brought this book to my parents' house, and my mom and sister were hooked after the first story.  They also loved the dog stories, possibly even more than I did, since their dogs are an EXACT match to Allie's helper and simple dogs (we even tried the blanket test with the simple dog - and got the same result).  My mother especially loved the childhood stories, due to her experience as a mother to a hyperactive, sugar-obsessed child.<br /><br />Like the other reviews already point out, half of this book new, while the other half uses existing stories from her blog. The existing stories are just as funny as the first read, and the new stories are great additions that really enhance the book. Extremely happy with the purchase, and I can only hope and pray that there will be a second book in the future.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book was ok. The story line was very predictable. it was decently written and I like the idea. Just wasn't compelling.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this game is very fun . but I think they should make the money values higher and make the the gas tanks a little bit closer
B008602KQI|4.0|Liked the movie. It reminds me of to much government involvement and how the people can make change happen. Take note.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game even though I have been stuck on some levels for months! Lol I will never delete it
B000NA22C6|5.0|Great scary movie. Not the same old slasher film just Depp gone round the bend. fantastic<br />and then theres John Turturro. SHOOT HER!! Chilling creepy&#62; Great!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|V for Vampire is loads of fun. It is very challenging.  I enjoy the humorous animation at the completion of each level.  The skill needed is increased in each level as is the challenge of solving the necessary route and choosing the proper tools needed to complete each task. I recommend this app for all ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I started reading it, it was a little boring. But it started to turn into a love story. I'd recommend this book if you like to read love stories.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|This is the last movie of a very original movie series! This movie series makes you think! Very killer movie baby! Everyone should have this in your collection!
B004KPLVYU|5.0|Depp is Brilliant Bonham Carter The Bloody Big Head WOnderful;/The movie is a master piece Love it all the way Burton at his best
B001NLL8LA|2.0|Reacher has become too egotistical for me. Not sure if I can keep reading these books  Have to read a sample first
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Pretty fun game, kinda hard at times and always asking for extra money. But still a fun game despite its short comings.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not everyone wants to post a zillion posts on Facebook, and your friends don't like it either, otherwise this is a good app
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! it's soo addicting I couldn't put my tablet down. its a great game to get you thinking. I was pretty sad when I finished it...... wish it had more levels
0340896965|5.0|David Nicholls left me speechless after reading his spectacular novel, One Day. At the beginning of the book I thought of it as dull and boring, but it wasn't until the third or fourth chapter, which I became attached to it and didn't want to put the book down. One of my fellow book club members, had no interest in it at the beginning either, and eventually just gave up on reading it. However, I believe that they did not give it enough time whatsoever. The format I found to be odd, but I enjoyed it because it was something different and out of my comfort zone. I happened to think that it was like a camera, taking you through memories that have happened over the years. Each and every year on that same July 15th day, I was filled with laughter and interest. Nicholls, in my opinion, was very good with characterization. He picked a good storyline of these two characters, Dex and Emma, who are in love, but just wont ever admit it. I was filled with joy and excitement when they would see each other again, I felt as if they had a purpose and meaning to each other all the time whether they were together or not.<br /><br />As another review had said, this book will teach readers, \\"Live everyday like it's your last.\\" In the end of this book, it really will affect the reader like it had done to myself. It took me a little to cope with the line that hit me hard with shock. The way it is written is very simple, but it also includes some British slang. Its simple to say that readers will either fall in love with this book like myself, or simply hate it and stop reading it after a few chapters, if lucky give it a few. This is a well written entertaining book filled with a mixture of feelings including sadness and humor that is worth spending your money on. It would be for someone who can take a frustrating story, one that does not go the way you want it to go at all times. Also, for one who can be prepared for a sad story because sadness sure does tie in. Anyone can really read this book; mainly women I would assume would enjoy reading this because it is a love story. This is a fantastic, heart-wrenching book, which is very real, and anyone would be missing out if they don't experience reading it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I am a long time Star Trek fan (i am old enough to have seen the original series original broadcast). This is a great movie with just enough references to the original to please a die hard fan while being a great flick for someone not into the Star Trek world. HIghly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very awesome. I love it. I would recommend this to everyone to play. And it is very fun to play.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Terrible.  It kept freezing my device, and never opened correctly.  This is truly an awful app and a headache to uninstall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's fun to see where you rank among your Facebook<br />Friends as you watch them on their journey through Candy land  I am a happy camper now
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fans of Stephen King will have likely read this book by now. Even if you're not one of his Constant Readers, you will enjoy learning what happened to little Danny from Kubrick's film, The Shining. Classic good vs evil book with the perfect drops of black and white from the yin and yang symbol. This is a fast paced fun read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting!! My family and I enjoy playing the game.. too bad only 5 lives to play with, other than that. the game is very challenging and fun!
B00EVW0VTI|3.0|The only nice thing is the young heroine. The plot wore me down.  The action on the front lawn was over the top.
B00BWJ91XK|3.0|Overall, I feel like it had lower production values than the LoTR trilogy. Things were obviously more computer generated, and I prefer the darker cinematography over the trilogy compared tot his.
0385351399|3.0|Eggers is writing a farce and trying to say that we have gone to far in social media and that it is dangerous if we go to far.  I just think he has taken it a little to far.  It is too easy for the invoations that happen in this  book to happen as rapidly as they do so it suspending ones disbelief for the farce is hard to do.  I do not think this ranks with 1984 as it is so often compared too.  It is 1984 light.  It seems to want to be that.  His proses is very good but I think this book like all timely book will not be so important in the very near future.  As well I think that it will be less enjoyable as the youth of the world find out that socail media makes them less socail and that it creates as many ills as it solves.<br /><br />It is a quick read and the farce is fun at times.  But if it is supposed to scare us or make us frightful of this brave new world than I think it fails.<br /><br />I think he is writing to have a social media book out, it is a trendy thing to write I think his talents could be better used.  This is the first of his books I cared to finish.  I was not looking for a happy ending and it was not so happy in the end, but it was surley not supprising.  It had a very constructed feel, I was not convinced of the reality of the Circle or those who populated it.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I saw Alan Jackson performing his music from The Bluegrass Album on Letterman. I purchased CD.  Totally thrilled.  Great music!!!!!!!!!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Still one of the best movies of all time. 3D not as good as theaters though. The regular blu-Ray is probably the better buy, as this 3D is just okay.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|for about 2 weeks of occasional use it was great. after that it didnt hold a charge and was very laggy on my ps3
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good story, I like King and Maxwell.  This book gave all their past secrets away. I like how they solve the crimes that other agencies could not.
B008133MDK|5.0|Excellent show top notch cast off the hook Brits know how to do a show really Don't know what can improve this show
B00D7OXUIK|5.0|Michelle Makarski is a brilliant violinist and I don't say this just because she's my sister-in-law. Jarrett's pretty good too ;)
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|The game crashed after I got really far in the game. It wouldn't go on saying a crash has occurred. I am very mad hope it  gets fixed soon.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Very good adventure, I like Puller stories.  He is a very good character.  Leaves you hanging about brother and how he ended up in Leavenworh.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Slender Man is full of actually scary visuals and sound effects. So it delivers there. Beyond that though the gameplay is just not complex at all, so the game just doesn't feel rewarding or addictive. The objectives are just way too few and too simple, namely: collect the notes, and don't LOOK at Slender Man..... yep that's it!<br />If they went a little further developing the gameplay it could be a great game. As is though this app is just not a keeper because it has no replay value, no reward for objectives, not enough objectives, no story line. If you like scary &#34;Horror&#34; genre apps and want a cheap thrill for a few minutes Slender Man 1 is worth a free download. But it didn't stay on my phone more than a few hours, so I wouldn't recommend paying for it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's exactly what I needed. I lost my mophie battery pack charger and when this came I tried and now I can charge both my kindle and mophie case. Thx
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps.  Only wish I was able to earn extras instead of having to pay real money for them. Still great game and very addictive.
B001EAWME2|1.0|One of the best horror movies ever made is ruined by this extremely poor transfer to Blu-Ray. The picture is visually extremely noisy and the soundtrack is out of synchronization. Don't waste your money.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Why...why...why are these headphones discontinued? Today's earbuds are mostly uncomfortable and have tinny sound. So we have to pay 50 dollars for<br />a used pair of 08's? An absolute disgrace!
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|I should give SMASH 5 stars.<br />There were in the later part of the season 2 shows back to back  that  I questioned if I would finish watching the show.  I'm so glad I watched the rest.<br /> Now, can't wait for next season
B007B5EDEG|5.0|One of the very best books I have ever read in my life.  With each chapter intertwining the characters deeper and deeper, you cannot wait to find out what is going to happen next as you finish each chapter.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Very cliche and mediocre. You can almost guess 90% of the movie. There is nothing special about this movie. I don't know why people love it so much. The reason I give it three star instead of one is that the cinematography and editing was pretty good.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|From the first chapter, I was captivated by the story of genetics professor Don Tillman, who suffers from what we come to deduce is Asperger's or something similar. Don lives by scientific principles and has arranged his life for maximum efficiency, productivity and logic. So when it's time to find a wife, he decides to obtain one scientifically through a questionnaire that will weed out unsuitable candidates. Of course, nothing goes to plan as he meets non-suitable Rosie but can't shake his illogical interest in seeing more of her. I normally wouldn't rate a humorous novel a 5, but this book was so perfectly constructed and enjoyable. Seeing the world through Don's eyes was both funny and illuminating. While he does have problems understanding much of human behavior, his persistent desire to learn made him so likable that the reader will be rooting for him. As someone who tends to be very structured and logical, I found myself thinking about Don's approach to life and, like him, making adjustments as I realize that, say, perhaps my husband wouldn't appreciate my suggestions (intended to help him do a task more efficiently) and might perceive it as &#34;nagging&#34;. I found myself going about my day with a smile as I envisioned things from Don's point of view. I couldn't wait to get back to this book every time I had to put it down, and read it in a weekend. Such fun! Highly recommend.
B00004TRD8|4.0|I'm not too big on the gratuitous swearing or the blood and guts in it, my main reason for liking it so much is Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor. To me it's what a female action hero should be. She's smart, ruthless, tough, and they actually have her get her hair messed up. If they made her a villain, she'd be even scarier than she already is. I like that they have her doing exercises to stay fit and get sweaty doing so. And to those who say she's not 'feminine', she's a mother. What's more 'feminine/womanly' than that? That's actually her whole focus, protecting her son.<br /><br />As to the special features, I haven't watched them all yet, I will say though that the review that said there was only one version of the movie on disc 1 is wrong. There is the theatrical version and the special edition. I have watched both, but I will not watch the special/uncut version again, some of the scenes I didn't like. The booklet was a welcome surprise, I didn't know there was one included. The metal casing is also nice, because I have 2 very inquisitive Siamese kittens.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />During the freeway chase when the T1000 is in the helicopter, I noticed after a few viewings that he forms a 2nd pair of arms/hands so he can pilot and shoot at the same time, and that is just CHEATING!
006202406X|2.0|I love the first two books but the ending is so sad and I just can't get over it. I can't even read anymore, not just this series. I feel like I'm not able to read after this...anything
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book made me teary eyed but I read it right after Fangirl and it just didn't hit me the same way. It was wonderful though. I felt so bad for Eleanor and I just loved Park. It was so real.
B001FB5634|4.0|After watching Threads I decided that I needed to watch something a bit more light hearted, so I picked The Road :-) So it is a bit more upbeat than Threads, but not by much. It tells the story of a man and his son doing whatever they need to survive in a dying world. Their dream is to reach the coast, although it's not clear what they hope to achieve beyond that besides survival.<br /><br />It's a bleak film in every respect, they have to scratch through the ruins of the world to find enough food to eat. They have to fear everyone they meet in case they view them as sport, or even worse as food. For the most part the people they meet are incidental, it is the boy and the father who are the centre of attention.<br /><br />They both play their parts well, the father is hard making the difficult choices where needed and trying to teach his son what he needs to know to survive. The boy is more innocent, are rather he is more hopeful, he wants to see the occasional glimpses of colour in a grey world. They balance each other well and he provides some balance to a grim film.<br /><br />And it is a grim film (the book even more so, but also worth checking out), but it is very well put together and acted. This is an excellent watch and highly recommended.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|So moving, I read it twice.  I realized this story was in the same era my Grandmother grew up, being born in 1898, and relished the insight to the changing times of past.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I haven't sat down to read a book in so long and I'm so glad it was this one. it's one of the best books I've ever read. I literally could not put it down, I'd be in class thinking about how I would want to read it or what's going to happen next. This book is astoundingly addicting and cannot wait to read the next book.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I learned a lot of history of the country and how hard the women have fought for freedom<br />to get educated.  We take too much for granted here in the United States.  I pray that she<br />succeeds in whatever she does.
1416972250|3.0|I haven't read it yet, so I don't really know how to rate it.  I am still reading other books in that series and so far I like them all.
0307887448|5.0|Great read that, as an engineer, I loved dorking out over.  A definite page turner.  It was so entertaining that at the end I wished it was a series so I could keep going!
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Very talented band who also have great people recording and mixing their records. I was concerned how they would write an album without Rev, but they definitely answered the bell.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|OF THTE THREE OF THE IRON MAN MOVIES THIS IS THE BEST! IT REALLY SHOWS THE TORMENT TONY AND PEPPER ARE GOING THROUGH AND THE WAY THEY OVERCONE IT!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! It is so funny! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the funniest guys, then add in the rest of the incredible cast, just love, love, love it!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So disappointed with this book.  I disliked how the chapters went back and forth between Tris and Four.  The story was difficult to get into with the introduction of so many characters.  The ending was depressing and made we rethink how I feel about this Trilogy.  I don't think I will go to see the movies now.  I should have stopped reading after the second book!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Funny movie with great writing. Could be better overall.Virtually the same plot as men in black. Could be men in black 4.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Another fantastically funny movie with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost! What Fun zombies can be when they are met with this cast of characters!!
B006YB9VJU|5.0|So nice , Better than i expected . Tag and activated many things . Isn't it the best things ever invented ?
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This was also a gift and the person I got it for didn't even realized they had a new release, so he is  thrilled with it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this series when it came out. Enjoyed it then, enjoyed the re-read now. Ps<br /> The movie is gr8t. Brings back my old training days, lol.
0446572985|5.0|I have always liked Baldacci, and this is one of  his best in recent books.  Interesting characters and very fast paced.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|It was a gift and the person I got if for absolutely loves it. He said the sound is definitely resurrected and the quality is great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game...Level 421 at this point. I don't know what I'm going to do when I reach level 500 as that is the hightest level right now.  Get more levels going Candy Crush people!!
B000HX499S|4.0|This is a classic and shows a NYC that has not existed for many years.  Hepburn plays a character on multiple levels both appealing and scared.  Not an easy acting role.
B004I744AS|5.0|It's a great app to use when reading hard or sophisticated book for class and need a little help. This app has more words than most other apps and is good for those random words in another language.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I deeply appreciated and enjoyed this book on understanding introverts and extroverts. It helped me understand some of my introvert tendecies. (sp?)
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|A computer that I bought a few years ago had this installed as a trial product and I played it quite a bit.  I enjoyed the fun graphics and game play, but it is limited.  It is quite a bit of fun, for what it is, and the price is right.  If you like a simple casual game that fills in quiet moments, this is a geed deal.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Great story.  Best prequel I have seen!  The way they reintroduced the characters and delivered the heartfelt story was great!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This is just a fantastic album with a retro style.  I would recommend this to a variety of music listeners because of the melodious nature of the album.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this app, the only downside is you have to wait 30 minutes for one life, or ask your Facebook friends.  If you don't have a Facebook account, then play at your own boredom
B003FSTN5C|5.0|why is these movies  so expensive  love them will order the rest  of the seasons when the prices meet my budget
B007SGM084|4.0|The storyline was incredible, if a little repetitive of the genre -- billionaire Dom falls for \\"submissive\\" young woman who turns his life upside down, in a good way. The BDSM was, I think, skillfully blended into the story. It was always there but rarely, if ever, overpowered the story. In fact, for someone curious about BDSM it makes for a nice introduction. Ms. James does a great job explaining the concepts of limits, types of play, and rules; particularly in the first book. However, her style of writing is what keeps me from giving this bundle five stars. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a \\"love conquers all\\" style and who isn't offended by the \\"kinky f#&@ery\\"! ;-)
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This game is fun and enjoyable.  The one downside is the view is really choppy.  I mean REALY choppy.  So bad it interferes with the game play, if you want to get a good slender game, get the 2nd one
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Easy to access and manage music library this is coming from a non technically savvy guy. I am using this site to manage my play lists as a spin instructor.
1476727651|4.0|A page turner with a disappointing ending.<br />I love Stephen King and read almost everything he writes and love it all. But this one, while it kept my interest, seemed a bit contrived at the end. And the guys who won the battle? Well, they had the odds very much in their favor. It just wasn't a fair contest.
1885167776|5.0|This is my Book-of-the-Year&#34;. As an executive coach, I read a lot about leadership and this book stands above the rest in 2013!  &#34;The ONE Thing&#34; is a great read, and, more importantly, it is a powerful tool for personal growth and focus.  It has had a significant impact in my own life as it has connected me, more clearly, with my Purpose and has given me compelling way to live my Priorities, in a way that &#34;makes me be appropriate in the moments of my life.&#34;  If leveraged as a guidebook/workbook, it's actually personal strategy book for life and leadership.  It is now on in the hands of many of my clients!
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Great movie! AN oldie, but a goodie. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones at their best. It even had subtitles, a big plus for me.
068485743X|5.0|Fantastic advice on the first five pages that can be applied to an entire manuscript. This book has vastly improved my writing and marketability. Highly recommended.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is the story of a young girl in France in WWII and the story of an American living in France in modern day and how their lives connect.  It reminds all of us that we should always remember the people and the horrors of that awful era.<br /><br />A touching, heartbreaking book that everyone should read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush Saga is now available for Kindle.  I played it on Facebook and looked for it among the Kindle apps but was disappointed that it wasn't offered.  I was very surprised to get the notice from Amazon that it is now offered.  I don't play a lot of games but this is my favorite.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|absorbing book from the first page.  I just loved how the main character didn't even realize she was different from the family that raised her.  Quite an accomplishment for a first time novelist.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|What cute fairy tale story, great weekend book when wanting something nice,sweet and romantic. It is what I would expect from a Harlequin book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|this is the Stephen King of old and I am thrilled.  Love how he weaves in &#34;The Shinning&#34; with this current novel.  eerie and delightful at the same time.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|The &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; franchise is steadily going downhill. This current installment has several frightening moments, but there really is nothing new and the ridiculous ending is anti-climactic.
B008SVFX96|2.0|I absolutely loved his first 2 albums!  I'd rank them with the best of Bon Jovi and much better than some.  I was very disappointed in this album.  After a couple of listens, it ended up in the bargain bin at a used cd store.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive but it's so much fun. Cannot get enough! Love to play and get lost in this sweet world!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|as i sit here, tapping into my kindle, eyes still wet with tears, all i can do is laugh at myself, because i want to read an imperial affliction, i want to know what happened to hazel grace, her parents... but i know that i wont find out (not because john green is a bumbling drunk...) because thats the point. great book, even better one the second and third (and infinite) time around. cant wait to read mr greens other titles.
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|This is a nice case. It's simple, fits well and I love the back, assuming you take the time to remove the plastic sheets. What I don't like is the cafe brown color. In the pictures, it looks much more rosy...more like the champagne gold on the iphone 5S. In person, it's a really awful color...more like a yellowish burnt umber. It's awful. That being said, I need a cover and plan to keep this one until I find something better.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Good game for all ages. Really nice graphics. Could use better starting weapons but all in all a good game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the most awesome game ever! I love the battles and power ups they have.  This is a 5 star game.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|Great calm identification and counting game. I like the games sound track and voice over. It is also nice to play on a tablet
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This was a gift to the Wife and we both enjoy this album . Jason Mraz is a great entertainer .
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|Great CD!  But it's still not as good as Fever or Vices and Virtues.  But 200% better than Pretty Odd.  Has a new unique sound.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I like this kind of Genre. The graphics were well done, had fun watching. It is amazing the things people create in their minds when it comes to computer graphics.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Shell part has a really nice, snug fit and hugs the Fire.  Folio case cover part, and elastic strap that secures it, seems a little less robust, but so far, so good! Good value, too.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's a good game, would be better if you could track the animals.  Only lets you move in a small area and the animals comes to you
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great game, never played Angry Bird. Even better with being Star Wars Angry Bird.<br />Would recommend to anyone, a must.
1600249310|5.0|Sparks is a master at making you feel as if you know the characters intimately. I love his work. Dear John did not disappoint me in any way.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I can't believe Brad Pitt would be associated w/ a film this bad.  The Zombie thing is generally overdone to begin with and this offered nothing new to the genre.  In fact, it wasn't well done for the genre.  It flat out didn't make sense.
0446693804|4.0|Fast shipped to me.<br />Book was slightly used but still a good book to read.<br />I haven't read this book yet but Nicholas Sparks books keep you interested and hard to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game will keep you coming back for more.After you play it for the first time your hooked and its on your mind like all the time,I be rushing to go on break so I can play love it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this program.....I am an avid reader and enjoy the ability to have books at my finger tips.  You never know when you will have a chance to read while on the go.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wish you had more lives obviously the higher you get the harder n lose lives faster. But otherwise fun game.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I downloaded the font part and there should be more choices in the font and the other options Microsoft office has to offer. It should have also included word art, text boxes, etc. This should really be better especially after paying $10 for the two packages and this one stated that it's usually $17.99. I think we as consumers deserve more than this.
B001V9LRTM|5.0|The only thing that I can complain about, and it's small, is that when sliding the box back into it's plastic sleeve (which probably isn't even intended to be retained), the tassles hanging from the box tend to bunch up in the plastic as it slides down into it. It's stupid to mention but for perfectionists and collectors its worth noting as that very plastic sleeve wil keep dust off of it. So now I have turned the plastic upside down and slide the cover over the DVD box as opposed to sliding the box into the plastic. Works great now! See, I have a brain.<br />On a side note, The Grateful Dead portion is just.... just so awesome to see finally. :)
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I enjoyed every chapter in this book.So many exciting things happened in 1927 and so many famous people emerged.Great book!
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|There is so much to say about this album but I'll leave that to Mr. Dylan, himself. He was always better with his words than I. Unfortunately, you'll have to buy this album to hear those words. So go on ahead, I won't hold you up any longer. If you liked Love & Theft, Modern Times, Together Through Life, and Time Out Of Mind, you have nothing to lose. I hate having to refer to them and compare and contasrt to them, but there are obvious differences between 60's Dylan, 70's Dylan, 80's Dylan, and so on and so forth. This is 2k Dylan, right in line with his previous works. There's so much going on in this masterpiece. Roll On John is haunting, Tempest will ring on and on like Highlands, and you'll be dancing the shimmy to the intro of Duqesne Whistle. Buy it now! This is his best album as of recent in my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Like the game but not the long wait when a level is not reached.  I also don't like the offer to pay money to continue play when a level is not reached within the given limits.
B0035G01WS|5.0|I love David Sedaris in general and this book does not disappoint. A must read for any David Sedaris fan!
0385336950|5.0|The novel is set in Alaska during World War II. The Japanese are making bombs, attaching them to balloons, and sending them over the Pacific Ocean. This actually happened, I hear. One of them landed here in Oregon. The story is about a young soldier assigned to the bomb disposal unit, his crazy commanding officer who is intimately attached to a mysterious woman who looks Japanese, but is actually part Russian and part Yupic (a people native to Alaska). What I liked about this book was that it kept the reader guessing. Was this woman really using magic? Why did the narrator later become a priest? Was Captain Gurley going to finally shoot someone? And who was that boy?<br /><br />It was a very good read, and I was very pleased my wife got it for me.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a fabulous book. The entire story line keeps you hooked and you never want to put the book down. I read this book in one day because I was so hooked. The author creates such vivid detail you can see it all happening in your head as you read. I would recommend this book to anyone for just a good read. If you are a movie fan as well these books set you up for the first and only movie that is out right now and it just creates a great atmosphere in every area. It can be a little intense sometimes and sometimes a tear jerk-er but those elements really just add to the book as a whole. If you are looking for just a solid read that you cannot put down then this is the book for you. The other bonus is it is not just one book; it is a series so when you are finished with this first one you still have two more books:)
B008JFUOVI|2.0|This is the worse movie of the 3. Would just rent it instead of buying it if you really want to see it.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Best book to realize/understand specific focus areas to go from good to great... gives you guidelines to benchmark your current practices vs those observed in great companies!
0802473156|5.0|Every couple should read this. It has transformed our marriage! Even if you are single, this book still helps you understand how you receive and give love.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|good steady puzzle game.  the rumors about the game match its play style. can be quite addictive.  very good contrast but fee different pieces available.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|I'll admit I was skeptical at first. I've always loved Mileys music and this album is no different. Well it is different. .... From what you've heard her do before but after the 3rd time through I enjoyed it.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Horrible film.  So sick of hollywood with all their images of drunk driving.  So sick of all the addict movies.  They sucks, it sucks.  Horrible film.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love this movie, and I bought it for our church library.  This came on time, and it works just fine.  Thank you!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I could go on for hours about how absolutely phenomenal this series is, but at this point it really speaks for itself. Each book brought something new and thrilling to the table, put readers through every emotion imaginable, and burrowed into my heart just a little more. After hundreds of books read, this still stands as my favorite series and will always be something I make comparisons to when it comes to finding a captivating and truly dynamic, well-written series with outstanding characters. Nothing really comes close, and Jennifer Armentrout closed out the Covenant series to bittersweet perfection. Once again I laughed, I cringed, I cursed the gods, and I cried as these characters that I have come to adore finished off their journey, and I will miss them like no others. Sentinel was simply exquisite, and it left my heart both happy and pained as I said goodbye to Alex, Aiden, and the rest of the 'Army of Awesomeness'.<br /><br />To Jennifer, I just love ya, and congratulations on completing Alex's story! You have given your readers exactly what they wanted and needed for this incredible series, and I can only hope that you decide to treat us to a follow-up (or maybe a spin-off??) sometime in the future!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is one of my favorite apps ( and I have a lot ) but I always run out of lives I think that if you pass a level and replay it you should not lose a life for replaying it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the books after seeing the movie.  The book was much better.  I wouldn't recommend it for young readers.
B00E0SX118|5.0|A great movie not only for the kids, but the entire family too! This movie is full of laughs and also has a lot of emotions too. I reccomened this movie 5 stars!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Best KoRn album in many years, and best album in general I have listened to in quite a long time.  It definitely has a feel of a grown up KoRn with grown up style and writing.  And having Head back in the group really shows what some of the music has been missing in the last couple albums.<br /><br />If you ever were a KoRn fan, this one is for you, don't overlook them like you &#34;might&#34; have the last so many albums.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I Personally Really Like This Movie. Its Funny & Interesting To Watch. i Recommend To Anyone That Likes Somewhat Funny Movies.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I thought this book was a great read and it was filled with very good information. Definitely going to drop the wheat and give this a go.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|I must preface this by stating I have been a big fan of the mule for over a decade. This said, this album ranks up with some of their best work, and one of the better albums since Allen Woody. A lot of the credit goes to the bass player, Jorgen Carlsson. He brings a lot of energy to the songs, and his counter point to Warren's playing really makes the songs interesting.<br /><br />This album has established Warren as a great songwriter, and should dispel any notion that this is just a jam band. Although the songs have great musical sections, it's the melody and the words that make this album. Listen to \\"Captured\\" and \\"Bring on the Music\\" to hear some truly inspired songs. Really an awesome effort!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not a bad game. I enjoy playing quite a bit. You just need to understand the rules and pay attention then you won't need to do in app purchases
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Great concept WEAK support...only supports Utube, Netflix, Hulu<br />No real support for iOS other than setting up<br />Hope they will support more Apps soon and better support Chrome browser in iOS
B005L38QK2|5.0|Awesome  cant say anymore.... does everything I want it to all the buttons are programmable and I love the feeling of the mouse............................................................................................
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I am reading through the Bosch series in order. This one captured me start to finish. Best yet.  On to the next.
1936719010|4.0|This was one of those books that when you were done reading it, you wanted to get off your lazy bum and do something. I would recommend it to anyone looking to write a book or a song, or just motivate yourself to write anything.
0811879542|4.0|cute book while children learn about many different concepts.  It has an interactive component that many young  children like and that you don't often find in many young children's books.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I put this book down for the last time at around 3am Friday night. There was no ethereal void that opened up in my chest like at the end of Firefly, Harry Potter, or Hunger Games. Instead I felt relieved that the series was over because this last book was difficult to keep reading. It was difficult to continue reading because the only thing that kept me turning pages was my dedication to the characters. Was it worth it? Yes. I think the characters deserved to be experienced in the story’s entirety.<br /><br />Thank you, Veronica for creating, in my opinion, the MOST feminist character in all of YA lit (and honestly my favorite character in all of YA).  Tobias is a compassionate, violent, and intelligent human. Veronica did an unbelievable job rounding this character into a damaged, yet extraordinarily strong man. When I say “strong” I don’t mean his ability to kick doors down or toss people like fleshy toys into the chasm. I could see his strength through his ability to challenge his circumstances, no matter how grim, and his resilient moral compass. His most brave acts were opening himself up to make honest human connections, even though his parents gave him every reason in the world to distrust others. Tobias tries and fails repeatedly to forgive himself for his history, dispositions and feelings. I found myself cringing at the harsh words he lashes himself with, but I totally get it!  His inability to forgive himself was self-reflection gone too far. I think a lot of readers identify and learn from that. In Allegiant we get to read what is going through his head. It’s amazing to see a male character who grapples with his hunger for power and tries to reject his behavioral-crutch of physical strength. His position of power changes as we progress through the books. We see that some things, such as his desire to help others and his unconditional respect for his peers and Tris, do not change. Not only does he treat them with hallowed respect, he treats themas equals probably because he sees his friendships as the most important thing; his chosen family.<br /><br />-Spoilers Ahead-<br />All of the raunchy scenes in this book were realistic and just-vague-enough. I’m fairly sure that Veronica intended for them to not have sex and that’s just fine! I am all for premarital sex, but the relationship that these two kids had were focused on their mental compatibility. For teens their relationship was awfully mature, even if they never had sex.<br /><br />Okay, so the actual plot was dull and old-hat. We get it- no one is to be trusted, not even the big wigs outside of the fence. The science behind the genetic explanation for Divergence is questionable, and the convenience of all the new and old characters falling into each other’s circles is unrealistic.  Especially at the end there is some nonsensical logic i.e. Gotta reset the whole compound in order to attain equality…including the green collar workers. Or—Oh, freak accident at the compound where their memories are wiped? Well the US Government doesn’t seem to notice and thinks it’s just another Friday at the office.<br />The main issue I have with Allegiant is that it offered nothing new in terms of character development for Tris or Tobias except for the very end. We read these two characters who are coming to terms with their ability to forgive others and themselves, but that is about the extent of it. Tobias and the rest of the GD’s are told that they are not special and are second class citizens. I do not buy for a second that Tobias or Christina would actually internalize that mantra. It’s lovely to see yet another uprising even if it was a familiar tune, but it was poorly planned and blasted full of plot holes.<br /><br />I am not sad that Tris dies. It seemed right and the sudden illumination of real self-sacrifice was the only real character development she experiences in the book. The most disturbing part, and the most realistic, is Tobias’ reaction to her death. These people are not even in their 20’s yet. They are young, resilient, and capable of moving through horrible loss. I admit, a 75% portion of my heart was rooting for an epilogue involving a happy Eaton family ending at the shooting range. In that universe I would have walked away feeling content and longing for an ultimate love of my own. In our current universe I put the book down and felt the need to reach out and be the friend Tobias needs. I felt pride for Tris’ impossibly difficult decisions and hoped that Tobias knows that Tris wants him to find more love and heal. In this universe I know that he has survived his worst fear—maybe he is Three now. I hope the readers know that Tobias probably struggles for a decade or two, but finds support and love…eventually. In both universes I feel content.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This a great game to give yourself a break from a long days work. It also helps you relax your brain.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is really fun I love it I love the doge the bear and the bee hive cause u get to slap the man in the face  if u like it like I do then good if u don't then u need to play it more and if u have never heard of it then check it out
B002TQ3OBU|5.0|Musical genius, not all of his work is a good as this. This is a must for  people that enjoy &#34;art &#34; music
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|This movie kind of annoyed me.  Definitely did not do a lot for the franchise.  Hopefully Resident Evil 73 is better.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I wanted to read this before the movie came out.  I expected it to be a childish book about video games preparing a child for a real game.  Instead it was actually deep and spent more time in the real world than it did in fantasy.
B002COTI64|5.0|She sounds great in all of the songs.  Clear voice.  Love the sound.  Really positive and upbeat album.  Two thumbs up.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|Not a good movie, and I am a huge fan of L. Di Caprio who is always great.<br />Do not recommend
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, but the fun leaves when you're stuck on a level FOREVER.......It can be ADDICTIVE.
B0029ZA49Q|5.0|The strap combined with the Lowepro camera bag made it possible to have my camera in front of me at all times.  Great for quick access when hiking.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It got me a job!!!! Need i say more??? lol Well i have to. Works as a practice software for me. Good for people that has basic understanding of the language.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|Dream Theater used to be a band of extreme skill and musical ability.  They would change from one tempo to another at the drop of a hat.  They would run different time frames from drums to the other instruments, etc, etc, etc.  This album is just blah.  If this were some pop artist doing it I would be impressed, but from a band like Dream Theater, its just boring.  I wish they'd get back to their roots and start writing something with some jamming riffs and awesome fast ditty bridges again.  When Portnoy left I knew we'd see who was really pushing the boringness of the band.  Unfortunately, Portnoy was right - they do need a break.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|If think that this game is awesome,fun,and totally fun to play with the whole family and friends to be able to have fun.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Musically this album is pretty good.  It's no Empire of Operation Mindcrime, but definitely one of the best albums they've done in a long time.  The biggest downfall for this album is the over compression and overly loudness of it.  There are a few tracks that even clip.  It may not be as bad as Metallica's Death Magnetic, but its not far behind.  Please quit with the Louder is Better and get back to doing great production!!!  Its ruining music!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app again, because now it's back on Android and I truly missed it. Thank you for updating it and making it available for Andriod again. It means a lot. I love how you can change the bubble colors whenever you get tired of a color.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first John Green novel I've read and I'm about to look for more. A beautifully written, poignant story about teen life, love and death. This story made me cry.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|Great new music from Elton John. Equal parts new and old style music. Wonderful sound and lyrics. Another new classic.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I think its fun and kid friendly!!!!!!  Its fun, easy to use, and a crowed pleaser!!! I love love love how its so challenging and leaves you on the edge of your feet!  I recommend it!
B00170F0WU|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and remember loving the movie, but it has been awhile.  I was speaking with my college aged daughter and discovered she hadn't seen it (while discussing Natalie Portman), and insisted we watch it together since it is the movie that 'made' Portman.  It holds up really, really well.  It was exciting, and the performances by the three leads are all excellent.  The final 30 minutes of the movie are among the best of any action adventure movie, where the violence is part of and necessary to the story, and not just trying to make things 'bigger' (such is done with most action adventure movies today).
B005COO1X6|4.0|Too short, even for a short story.  It left the reader kinda wishing they never picked it up. So boo on this one
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Brilliant.  This does not mirror the original series, and that is a good thing.  This movie is even darker than the last.  They still shed hope on the future, but shows our modern darkness.  I have watched this movie 5 times already.  Great characters and fun interactions.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I am a mechanic and have worn this watch everyday for the last six months. I've put it through hell, smacked, banged and even burn it. Runs about 4 minutes slow every month but for a super cheap automatic you can't beat it. The crystal has held up well, I suspect after another year or two it may need a replacement due to scratches from extreme use. Others wise this watch I has outlasted a Swiss army and a diesel watch by a long shot. Will buy another as a spare. Some people say it's not hack able but I found that if you wind it past the time and then go backwards, it freezes the second hand. Anyway great buy.<br /><br />UPDATE, four months in it died on me. Wore everyday, had a lazy weekend and it stopped. Got it started again and It ran 10mins fast everyday. Didn't mess with the warranty since it was a cheap watch. That's why it still has 2 stars. Recommend the citizen Eco military style watch, that's what replaced this one and is still working well.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Hilarious and well-done sequel to a family favorite. Fun and pun for the kids and the adults.  Disney Pixar delivers another great film!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Marvel fan from way back. Love comics, bringing it to the big screen is awesome. great cast!! Can you find Stan Lee?
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the book up until about 3/4 through... When you find out what is really happening I just didn't like it and then the ending/non ending really irritated me. The writing is pretty good and there were a bunch of funny lines but I thought it all happened in the first half of the book..
1250038820|5.0|Humans of New York far surpassed my expectations!  I can't get enough.<br />Every time I look at it my heart is filled.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book.  It kept me very interested in what was going to happen next.  I found myself not able to put it down at night.  The audible version caused me to be late for work as kept sitting in the parking lot listenting to it.  The author was okay but the voices she used for the male characters was annoying - that's not the authors fault though.  All together this was a great book with many characters that you take a liking to and some that you downright can's stand.  I highly reccomend it.
1594203334|3.0|We are American expats living in a neighborhood near Paris. I read this book before coming to France and quite honestly it stressed me out more than helped me. Let me start out by saying that I am not your &#34;typical&#34; American mom according to Ms. Druckerman. I am a no nonsense kind of parent and I have been taking my children out everywhere with us since the day they were born. My husband and I have always had the philosophy that every member in this family has to compromise. There is a time for everything, and each one gets their turn. Like &#34;French Parenting&#34;, I guess you would say. My girls are happy, upbeat and sweet children. I feel Pamela Druckerman bashes American parenting in her process of contrasting. Let me say that I, so far, have not been at all impressed with French children's behavior. In restaurants, I have seen no difference in French children's behavior than from those in the US. We have traveled extensively throughout France, and eaten from your corner Brasseries to the top end 200 euro bill restaurants. Children's menus in restaurants always have breaded chicken (Poulet Pane) and frites (fries), if you get the &#34;formule&#34;, you get a scoop of ice cream for desert. They give you the option of getting seasonal vegetables... but they do that in the US too. Not astronomical. So, I call shenanigans when she says that &#34;children are expected to eat what adults eat&#34;.<br />We went to the Playmobil Fun Park near Paris yesterday with my daughters, and my goodness! There were some really awful and selfish children. There was a child that was behaving awful, throwing Playmobil parts up in the air, at many times these parts landing on my head. Where are these well behaved children Ms. Druckerman speaks of? So far, I see no difference, in fact it may be a little worse because kids in the US at least smile back at you when you smile at them. Maybe Mrs. Druckerman is generalizing &#34;America&#34; when it seems like she has only had experience with New York parents. We are from Houston, it may be a different parenting philosophy than up north, but I really wish people wouldn't criticize parenting in the US. Druckerman is very biased, in my opinion, and I feel she has not stressed US parenting pros enough in her book. Because, there are plenty. After living here, and experiencing &#34;bringing up my bebes&#34; in France for myself, I feel she has exaggerated the wisdom of French parenting. I asked French friends about some of the points in this book and their reply was &#34;oh, that used to be before, not so much anymore&#34;. So please American moms, take what you feel will help you from this book, because yes, it does make sense. Its okay to give time to yourself, but don't stress out if you cant follow the book. You do what you think is right. That's what French moms are doing too.<br />I gave it three stars because it is a good read, and very well written. I just don't like how biased it is.

B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Much better movie than I expected it to be. Almost a complete departure from story line of the original Judge Dredd played by Stallone.  This is not a sequel. Pretty good story line - I would watch it again.

B008PPUMVY|1.0|Joe's Garage Acts I II & III<br />Although the music is good, I could do without the lyrics.<br />It is typical Frank Zappa, and I guess I should have<br />expected that. I have heard Frank Zappa tunes on the radio<br />that I thought were amazing but I don't know what the names of<br />the tunes were and I was hoping would like this CD.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Fun for the family. I usually play it with the kids and we try to guess. The kids always have fun and they try to guess as a team.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and could not be happier with the set of movies. The box is nice it comes in and it is the complete set of movies for the series. For a box set of movies this is a great deal. This is a classic series of movies and it's nice to own the complete set.
0062020889|3.0|I think this is a good novel, well written with enough twists to keep one interested even after the main plot line is clear. Follett has a way of building suspense as the novel unfolds even as the reader knows more rather than less. The guesses become more abundant.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a very good free game. Better than other bingo games which I have tried. I play on my kindle fire. Occasionally the connection is lost while playing.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. Totally addicted, damn you! Got it as the Amazon FAOTD, but gotta figure out how to pay for it as a 'thank you' to the developer. Yes, it's that good. Wish I was a better astronaut though. I crash a LOT. How did we ever make it to the moon and back 40 years ago? Kudos to the engineers who figured that out.
B003G4W49C|3.0|&lt;B>Review originally posted on my blog at westmetromommy.blogspot.com<br />3.0 Stars&lt;/b><br /><br />It has taken me a long time to read this book.  I've had people recommend it to me for the past decade and, at one point, one of my previous book clubs discussed it.  Since I knew I wouldn't be able to make that meeting, I didn't bother to read this.  Finally, my good friend and most trusted book buddy convinced me to read it before the movie comes out.  So, I did.<br /><br />Eveyone I know who has read this book was completely blown away by it.  I, on the otherhand, was underwhelmed.  I don't know if it is because this book was so hyped to me before I even read it or if it just isn't &#34;my type&#34; of book (I do not normally read science fiction), but it was just &#34;eh&#34; to me.<br /><br />I have some minor quibbles with the writing.  I felt the battle scenes were just a bit over-written and could have been simplified or stream-lined.  I also felt that the 3rd person point of view shifted too much--in the midst of describing what was happening in the mind of one character, it would switch to another character, then back to the first character.  But, really, there weren't any major problems with the writing, or the plot.  It just didn't click with me.<br /><br />I'm clearly in the minority on this and there are many, many people who love this book--I'm just not one of them.  I am planning to eventually see the movie and, maybe, that may change my mind about the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally I've gotten it installed on my tablet really like this  game. This game game is very very very addicting waiting for squeal

0992251656|5.0|I've gotten about 3 play-throughs so far on this game. It captures the essence of Firefly/Serenity very well. If you enjoyed the story and characters, you will certainly enjoy this game.<br /><br />To begin, you pick a ship and a captain. Then you'll want to pick some crew and/or upgrades to your ship and get some jobs appropriate to the story you are playing through.<br /><br />The game comes with 6 story cards to play through (one of which is a solo story) with a 7th starter story you can find online. Each takes roughly 2 hours to complete, though the first couple of games may take longer just getting used to how it works. You can have up to 4 players. All of the players are trying to complete goals in the story with the aim of being first to meet the requirements. Typically, the story has you dealing with some of the characters introduced during the show, such as Badger and Patience, to complete jobs and earn money. You will have to deal with the Alliance, Reavers and, often, the other players as you attempt to complete your jobs.<br /><br />The number of decks can be a little overwhelming at first, but the bulk of them (the job and supply decks, as well as the Alliance/Reaver deck to some degree) are related to a particular location on the board and tend to get used the same way throughout the game. The \\"Aim to Misbehave\\" deck is connected to certain jobs and adds variety to the game. There are three types of tokens that apply only to the ships, one type of token that can apply to crew, and a warrant/goal token that applies to the whole ship. The money is gorgeous and there is a rumor that it was designed by the same fellow that did the money for the show/movie. All in all, the setup gets faster after the first game or two as does the turn time. There are enough differences between the captains and the stories to allow for some different strategies and techniques as well.
0451232577|5.0|Easy to follow , despite great length and multiple plot lines .Great yarn with fully fleshed out characters . Well worth your time !
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love the classics and this is one of my all time favorites!  Sherlock Holmes and Watson are my favorite duo.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Excellent Night stand Clock with an adjustable brightness feature.  Use it almost every night, especially with the coice of alarms.
1589949811|5.0|This is an excellent cooperative card game for those that play the likes of Magic: The Gathering or L5R.  This game has everything you need to play for 2 players (with a few 10 sided dice to get up to 4 players) and is expandable via expansions (as opposed to randomized boosters of a customizable card game)<br /><br />The game is quite immersive and difficult. Players work together commanding a few heroes and a deck as they try to overcome monsters and keep their threat down to avoid the nasty Eye of Mordor, as they journey through quests to win the game. A great sense of teamwork exists as players help each other as they pilot their deck and grasp their strengths and weaknesses and support each other.<br /><br />There's a moderate learning curve to playing this game and the internet is full of nice sources to help you learn how to play, but once you get the ruleset, it's quite fun.<br /><br />It's important to note this is a gamers' game. The game is quite text heavy with fiddly texts, and those that aren't really into board games might not get a kick out of it.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|You know, for some reason I didn't want to like this movie.  All the hype.  All the Tony Stark &#34;soul searching&#34;.  But I can't help it.  IT REALLY IS REALLY GOOD! Robert Downey has simply defined the role and his wit and faults make him an incredibly human super hero. Putting Gwyneth into the suit was first rate and she just smokes (literally).  Ben Kingsley is amazingly versatile.  Guy Pearce does a show stealing job and once again proves he is one of the most under appreciated leading actors in Hollywood.  As is true of Don Cheedle. Hey, Spiderman loses his abilities.  Batman screws up.  Even Superman loses his powers once in a while...I think the ending is a bit overdone.  The cool thing about Ironman is that HE's IN THE SUIT, not operating a gameboy...  Oh well, can't have it all.  Great pace, dialogue and special effects.  Robert Downey, Gwyneth, Don, this really was the best of a great series.  Keep it going.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|IT'S  FUN FOR KIDS  it's easy to play and my grandaughter can play with no problem.  It doesn't go on forever.

B008602KQI|5.0|Great adaptation of the book. Relatively true to the book story. Loved it. Looking forward to the next instalment in the series.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Solid album bought it well at work and played well working in the stock room. I will be listening to this especially when I drive around town.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|I enjoyed the book, and as my experience with Gary's previous books, he/Pursah/Arten illuminated some parts of the course I hadn't considered before.  The discussion on saying &#34;I'm sorry&#34; really hit home.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a great series if you love that period. Recommended as a very entertaining story to watch when you are looking for something in the Drama genre.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|the follow through was great. liked the little flash backs Danny had to remind us of the horror of the Outlook disaster. little tidbits too to some behind the scenes goings on with Danny and his family.  my imagination w/the great details of the story were very disturbing.  great story
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I simply couldn't put it down! I felt like I was on the journey with Theo. Vivid characters that stay in my mind after the last page is read and a wonderful study of human nature....the good, the bad and the ugly.
B00BYN3V26|5.0|This cd contains a rendition of a live concert given november of last year (2012) to commemorate the 200 year anniversary of the &#34;Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde&#34; in Vienna.<br />Mr. Harnoncourt conducts, according to the textbook and some online research that I did, a massively expanded Concentus Musicus Wien, the Singverein der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna and soloists Roberta Invernizzi, Werner Gura and Gerald Finley.<br />According to the research that I did, the piece was originally composed by Friedrich Handel on a text by John Dryden but later translated into German by Carl Wilhelm Ramler in 1766. Mozart reworked this translation to a large extend for a series of concerts in july of 1790. In fact, the revision by Mozart of thsi work is to such a degree that the work carries its own number in Kochel`s Verzeichnis der Werke W.A. Mozarts.<br /><br />The concerts in Vienna`s Musikverein in November 2012 were done as a celebration of this institute`s 200th birthday and tried to recapture or duplicate the Musikverein`s first concert ever November 29th, 1812. That particular concert was conducted by Ignaz Franz von Mosel who, according to the documentation, further revised the work to include a large bass drum.<br /><br />The power of this music is simply stunning. To my ears, the &#34;Handel&#34; part is much larher than the &#34;Mozart&#34; part, but, of course, I have not researched the autograpph scores in the Musikverein`s library the way that Mr. Harnoncourt did for this performance so, how could I really know what Mozart changed in Handels`s score for his performances? Moreover, I do not know the original Handel piece called &#34;Alexander`s feast or the power of music&#34; well enough to have any opinion on the matter.<br /><br />The historic angle is interesting, of course. However, much more imortant is the quality of the performance which leaves the hearer slack jawed. This wonderfull, powerfull music that rocks the very soul!<br />The orchestra plays as precise and inspired as ever. The choir is extremely versatile and flexible, especially when one knows that it consists of 100 singers..<br />The soloists are great and seem genuienly inspired by the musical direction.<br /><br />The secon disc starts with a litle explanation by Mr. Harnoncourt and a call for the audience to sing along with the first chorus. There is some practising and some witty remarks by the Conductor which evokes lots of laughter in the audince. That audience consisted of everyone of importance in Vienna`s and Austria`s music life among whom Mr. Thomas Hampson! and several other professional singers..<br />Unfortunately, Sony has not provided a translation into English so that one must speak German to understand it. The booklet with this disc contains very little information anyway, I do wish that some more would have been provided. This is not difficult, either, I know for a fact that the progran for the concert in Vienna held a wealth of info that could easily have been copied for this release. In fact, the audience was given the printed score on the chorus which they were asked to sing along with!<br /><br />All in all a wonderfull disc of great music. A must for those who like Mr. Harnoncourt`s work and a must for Handel and Mozart lovers.<br /><br />One tip: Played on a good system, the bass drums are especially loud and may wake up the kids if played late at night.chestra plays as precise and inspired as ever.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The games seems to be geared to making money.  Seems impossible to win unless you purchase another life when you cannot complete level.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I liked this app but when I had to reinstall it I read the screen about the info it snags.  Sensitive logs,  phone and camera info are just a few that make no sense to me. Uninstalled.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I love action movies and this had plenty enough in it for me. Have recommend this to my kids. They love action as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm definitely addicted to this game and I'm so glad it's on my kindle fire now!<br />This is a great game to pass time and I often find myself playing while watching Tv or waiting for appointments.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Had to add this to the collection of X-men. I have loved them all and to me this one did not disappoint me at all. Plenty of action in it for me loved it!
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Its a great show. A Blu ray I will watch for years to come. Always has surprises and exciting scenes.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Added this one to my collection. Enjoyed the first and the second to me did not disappoint me at all.  Enjoy it very much.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|The app is amazing, details are great but theres one problem. Theres a glitch on world 3-1 and when you respawn it kills you. It makes no sense, thats the only bad thing in the game otherwise its awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Some levels are ridiculous and after 4 weeks on the same one I'm considering deleting the app. Too long on one is no fun!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book very mush. It was a pleasure to read something that was different and held my interest from start to finish.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you haven't read the third book because the reviews haven't been good should ignore what others say and figure it out for himself/herself.  People who do not like the ending of this book have do not appreciate good literature.<br /><br />When an author writes a novel he/she writes it to share his/her opinions and ideas about a topic.  I will say I cried through the last chapters of this book.  Veronica Roth ripped my heart out, stomped on it and then watched me sit and bleed to death.  I will also say that Veronica Roth clearly stated the theme she wanted to portray to her readers.  Allegiant was a huge success as far as novels go and if it takes tears to get a point across to a reader then let there be a river in my front yard.
1594203334|4.0|Some great ideas for American parents to stop being so watchful (hint - it's not helping you or your child!).

1400069289|4.0|Duhigg's book contains some cutting-edge neuroscience on why habits inculcate the way they do.  Recommended if you are trying to understand/counsel/develop people.

B00E89VXQY|5.0|This clearly shows why Metallica is the best band ever and still relevant and making 3-D movies thirty-two years after founding.  The sound quality on this is BETTER than ANY of their other live recordings - it's unbelievable actually how good it sounds.
B00847UYWA|5.0|Lives up to the hype. This is truly was one the creepiest collections ever written and I can see why it influenced Lovecraft.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong on my PC so this was a &#34;no brainer&#34; as a purchase. The tiles can be a little tricky to distinguish at times but all it takes is going a little more slowly when tapping them. Nothing fancy just good old Mahjong.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! Me and my daughter both play and see who can get to the next level first. Totally fun game!
B000IZ8DZQ|5.0|Great movie with great locations and cars!!  Plus I got to visit the prison that mr Bircher is in this past summer in Dublin!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have so many alarms, you would think I was apart of the  fire department.  This one has never let me down...
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy the puzzles. Hours of fun and very good selection of puzzles. Fun fun fun and more fun. Love it
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Maybe it's just me, but this book was a little slow and boring. Also the end was pretty disappointing. I'm a 14 year old girl, so I should relate in terms of entering high school, drug abuse, peer pressure, and relationships, but I didn't. Charlie is a socially awkward person and as he is writing the letters that carry throughout the story, it is expected for the text to be a little monotonous and casual, but it never really kept my attention. I understand being in character but it might've been taken too far.<br />  On a positive note, the detail in the story really make the characters come alive. I found myself considering Charlie to be a friend, (as the letters suggest). I would like to read the book again, because I got confused with the conclusion and I understand that I couldn't missed an importable detail earlier in the book. So I don't necessarily recommend the book, but I'm not going to put it into a negative light because it's probably my fault I got confused with the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun! It is also very addicting so BEWARE! They change the theme all the time and they always have little things to collect during the runs depending on the theme. Right now it is halloween and there are these little pumpkins to collect. This game is so much better than temple run. plus this game has little missions you can complete for prides. TAKE THAT TEMPLE RUN!
B003W77SA8|5.0|A classic album from a band at its peak. ELO's mix of rock, synthetic and classical sound is still unique today. This and _Out Of The Blue_ probably best define the band's sound. I've owned the LP for decades and it's nice to finally hear the music without the pops and scratches from the old vinyl. The CD is well mastered and sounds just like the original.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was amazing! So well done, and doesn't deviate much from the book. Loved that I could stream this through Prime.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|The original LP was a double album set; and worth every second of play time. Today, it's hard enough to find a CD where more than half the tracks are decent yet _Out Of The Blue_ delivered across two LPs. This CD squeezes those two LPs onto one disc and the sound is very much like the original vinyl. A great recording from a great band.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on my kindle love it! Very addicting and I am new to the game. Can't wait to get to the next level
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|Works perfectly with my 2013 MacBook Air.  Plug and play.  Wifi mouse is recognized also. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add more USB ports to their system
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I kind of hated how fast I tore through this book, but oh my gosh. It was freaking AMAZING. Fantastic for teens.
0385351399|2.0|I'm a great admirer of Dave Eggers, so this novel was such a disappointment. It's not that the points he labors are not valid and worthy of discussion by us all, and I continue to ponder them ( for instance,when I read recently of a device to track students' engagement by analysing their eye movements...ugh). But as literature it is pretty much drivel. Like other bad science fiction, and like, in many ways, Atlas Shrugged ( which I happen to have read recently), imaginative applications of philosophical ideas turn simplistic when characters and themes are given short shrift. Much of the action became cartoonish ( the drones pursuing a character to his death was so ridiculous as to be laughable, for instance), the main character is shallow and ultimately unlikeable, and--here's my point--when you can't deal with anything close to the real complexity of life as a human being, you can not adequately address those issues that need addressing. Maybe Eggers had no intention of writing good literature, but I think he COULD have.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Could watch this over and over again. Its a fantastic movie! Loved it!!!!!
B006ZS81GG|5.0|Lana, so pretty and talented. Her songs have that sadness (no pun intended) that appeals to a lot if audiences. this one has been stuck on the repeat for a while now on my player. just cant get enough. Her lyrics are brilliant and her voice is amazing modern blues we dare to say, maybe not in the arrangements but in the lyric style.
B0081336FO|5.0|Once again the writers have exceeded my expectations. Awesome keep up the good work looking forward to the next season
B00BD99JMW|1.0|How could you do that to us. I'm so disappointed I read for the happy endings because life all too often does not have a happy ending. I'm so so sad that such a great series ended so tragically. I wish I hadn't read it.
034552554X|5.0|this book was for our granddaughter and she liked it. thank you. that is all I can say for now.
B00ARF92HK|1.0|Keep it simple.  Awful movie with little plot and storyline and just tries to shock with Gore. Pass on it even if free
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It looks so real.I feel like I'm actually hunting in the woods. For people that like to hunt this is the game for you.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Such a sweet and lovely book- makes me want to sign up for a flower class, and learn the language of flowers myself.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I love the country, river living scenario.  Matthew is incredible and the two boys are so natural and believable!  Reese Witherspoon is as amazing as always and plays a really good and affective dramatic roll,  She's very versatile!
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|I have enjoyed the other books from this group, but was really looking forward to Remote: Office Not Required.<br /><br />It completely delivered. I work remote part time now and have been doing so for several years. I still learned a few things from this book. Well written, clearly lays out their ideas, and they eat their own dog food. Well worth reading.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is the best of the best of the classics.  The music is beautiful!  It's romantic, funny, dramatic, all these things.  It even has spiritual messages contained in it.  The scenery of Austria is breathtaking.
B00E1LQ7Q0|4.0|Excellent CD, great songs. The only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars is that there are 4 bonus tracks that should have been included to make a truly &#34;complete&#34; experience. To get the bonus tracks, you have to buy the two separate &#34;deluxe&#34; versions.<br /><br />Still, that's no criticism of the music, it's great. Lots of modern beats, upbeat dance/R&B style. Perfect workout music.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Very additive and lots of hidden gimmicks in this game and would prefer more disclosure before downloading installing.  Read the description more carefully before installing.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|I love K.D. Lang's voice, and this is a great collection. I have really enjoyed it and have purchased a copy for a gift, too.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Did not work for me.  Tried several times but could not get the App to work as advertised, so I gave up on it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Having just seen the movie, I thought I might re-read the novel. Excellent in character development, setting, and plot. The moral evolution that Ender goes through is satisfying, layered, and deep. The only sour note is a bit of a 1980's &#34;Battle School isn't for Girls&#34; bias.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film for the summer action movie that it is, but I wish they had not carved the soul out of the novel to make it fit in 114 minutes. This story deserved so much more.<br /><br />Vern McGeorge<br />Author of &#34;All Fall Down&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the kind of book I hate. Not because of badly developed characters or plot, but because I never get any sleep! When I read it for the second time I stayed up until 3 to finish it despite the fact that I already knew how it ended! READ THIS BOOK! It is definitely worth being a little drowsy. ;)
B007N8RULO|5.0|Wow, this is a highly addictive game.  I play it all the time and try and beat my previous scores.  Basic solitaire principles, line up your card from King to Ace to discard.  The decks are all spades but it makes to think and reason.  Recommended game.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wasn't sure where this was going when the series started. I know now that I like it better than the Hunger Games series. The message, the symbolism is better for the YA crowd.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I used the free version for several months and recently upgraded tow the paid. It works very well and delivers everything advertised.
006202406X|1.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent and was really looking forward to Allegiant. I don't recommend this book to anyone unless you want to be distraught and depressed for days afterwards. The first 300 pages are boring and totally detached from the plot of the first two books. The book picks up in the end only to leave the readers brokenhearted. There is no happy ending. There is no real closure. The author can do anything she wants with the final book and needless to say, I really dislike Veronica Roth as an author after reading this. Why end a once epic trilogy this way? I read books to be entertained and I was far from entertained. I recommend readers only reading the first two books and making up their own ending.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Almost everybody wants for life to take the necessary twists and turns that make them rich, happy, free.  How the story unfolds is genius in actions. A walk on the wild side of believable... Thanks.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series has interesting stories. Also, you get to know the characters with each episode with much enjoyment. They have been fun to watch and adicting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, but I would love to have more lives than just five so I can keep playing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Gives me something fun to do when I have a couple minutes, waiting for some one or some thing.  Addictive, however.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is the best Bible. I appreciate this one put on Amazon.<br />What an all inclusive addition of Bible translations.
B00FBNFZEC|4.0|Entertaining mystery. The story being told from the viewpoint of the different characters makes it more interesting and gives an insight into life in the 19th century.

1623360277|5.0|This book helped me to understand the profound importance of basing my diet on starches.  I have been experimenting and putting these solutions into practice and I am having good results.  In addition to this book, read Dr. Esselstyn's &#34;Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease&#34; and Dr. Campbell's &#34;The China Study&#34;.  They are on the same path with what you will read here from different perspectives and all to promote good health.  The sad thing is that after reading these books, you will find that most doctors are in the dark about nutrition and how it affects health.  Most doctors treat symptons and are not courageous enough to deal with the root of the problem.  They must have some suspicion as to why so many people are dying of cancer and heart disease.  True healing only takes place when you take control of your own health.

0684824906|4.0|This book was  well researched  and the characters' stories were well delivered with anecdotes and excerpts from letters of eye witnesses.  This  is a period  of American history that I chose not to dwell on when I was in high school.  I find myself very interested now that I have lived a little.

B001G70M6S|5.0|I love this film. The negatives are scannable once dry and the development time of 15 seconds makes using this film a piece of cake. I want to shoot as much as possible before Fuji shuts down their production lines.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It is well written and gives a very good picture of the historical time of plot.  People interested in historical effects on normal people will like this novel.
B000B589JI|1.0|I like having this small fuel canister for my zippo lighter, however, this has the sole purpose to store fuel, and it doesn't, it leaks.<br /><br />I did read a review saying how he changed a rubber washer so that it would close tightly without leaking, I figured that not all these fuel canisters would have this problem so I bought it and I got one that leaked...<br /><br />This canister has 2 rubber washers, one for the tank, and another smaller one for the outlet tip. I was able to find a replacement for the bigger rubber washer but haven't been able to for the smaller one, so it still leaks through the top.<br /><br />It's quite disappointing getting such a simple product which won't work out of the box.

0545128285|5.0|I haven't finished reading it yet due to lack of time, but I'm enjoying what I've read so far. Perfect condition and edition to add to my collection. Fast delivery.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I will admit that I'm not all the way through the first book, but having watched the series on HBO, I am greatly enjoying the book version.  I'm one of those people who likes to read the book after seeing the adaptation, so that I can fully enjoy both formats - I find that reading the book after watching the show allows me to flesh out the lore and details, and really start to understand the plot more fully.  It's great seeing inside the heads of all the characters I've grown to love (and hate), gives a whole new perspective on things.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Nice to have KT return to her acoustic roots from the 'experimental electronica' of Tiger Suit.  If you liked her early work, you will love this.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|While I am a big fan of both of these actors, this was just sad and boring.  There was no chemistry between the characters and it felt like they were given conflicting guidance on what type of movie it was supposed to be.  I would love to see a Part II with something different (not sure what), as the premise looked to be and would still be exciting.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I bought this game & lived it so much that I had my boyfriend buy it then two of his friends bought it too! Needless to say, this game is a popular in my circle. Great time had by all. I just wish it would let you compete with friends on marksmanship.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I loved this movie!  I don't go to movie theaters and wait until movies come out on DVD's and somehow missed this one.  It was so well acted, sad, warm, funny, just an excellent movie.  Guess it was meant to be that I watched it at this time in my life.

B008M0NDOK|4.0|This a good gaming pad. I say good because it does and works like you would expect it to, but does have some issues.<br />Its wonderful for the fact it works. Many iOS gamepads don't. It has two analog joystick which is awesome, especially for racing.  It comes with a great stand that holds both (iPad/iphone) and controller. The downside is that it currently is limited to a select few games by Gameloft. Also depending on your comfort level it may feel 'clunky' and awkward to hold. If it had universal support for games I would be ecstatic.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• It works<br />• Dual analog<br />• Easy to use and set up<br />Cons:<br />• Limited to select Gameloft games<br />* Irregular shape
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|It is an amusing concept but didn't really hold my interest to play it more than a time or two.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it, it was challenging but not so much that you want to quit can't wait for the next levels
B000IZJZLM|3.0|It's fine but when I ordered it there was no music sample that you could hear the songs.  Unfortunately, I had the impression that the songs would include more English songs which it did not.
0743298039|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much.  Like another poster, I find myself drawn to books that are about authors (fictional) and their fans. The only \\"negative\\" for me was the lack of a time-period reference.  The biographer-protagonist appeared to be contemporary, but some of the ways the present-day characters communicated (by letter, mostly) seemed rooted in the past. That was a little confusing.  Otherwise, I found the story to be atmospheric & compelling.  Looking forward to reading more of Ms. Setterfield's work!
1451666179|5.0|This is a superb collection of Hyperbole and a Half stories! My favorite story had to be the story about her mother getting her and her sister lost in the woods when they were very young. Even the stories reprinted from the online blog are wonderful to see in paper form. After all, in case there is a terrible worldwide catastrophe and civilization collapses and the internet goes down, leaving every internet junkie in withdrawal, YOU will still be able to read some old Hyperbole and a half favorites by candlelight while fighting off a pack of zombies...or wolves....or zombie wolves....
B00DWOUY3Y|5.0|This set is worth acquiring for just one of the performances-the 1940 Othello (previously unreleased) featuring Giovanni Martinelli. There is a similarly cast 1938 recording  on Naxos but there the sound is distorted and filled with extraneous noise. Here the audio is clear and undistorted and the listener will appreciate why this tenor has such a legendary reputation in this role. The rest of the cast as well at the orchestral playing make this an Othello of a lifetime. Just think of the other 9 operas as a bonus!<br /><br />Given that these are live historic recordings the potential purchaser will want to know about the sound quality. There are only two operas in which the listener will have to exercise a significant degree of tolerance. The 1935 Traviata has apparently been remarkably restored and any effort will be rewarded in hearing Rosa Ponselle's famous rendition of Voiletta. The Falstaff conducted by Reiner is also less than sonically acceptable but again, there are more than adequate compensations from the star studded cast and vital orchestral playing. Curiously, even the relatively modern 1967 recording of Aida is dry and lifeless. Generally, apart from the previously mentioned exceptions, the mono sound is quite acceptable and tolerable.<br /><br />In listening to the operas, there was no performance that was below an excellent quality. There is a veritable cavalcade of exceptional singing. Particularly memorable was Leontine Price as Aida, the young Bjorling in Ballo and Rigoletto, as well as another youthful Di Stefano as Fenton (Falstaff). There are too many other stellar examples of vocal brilliance to enumerate!<br /><br />With regards to the packaging, some skill and determination needs to be developed to prise the discs out of the flimsy cardboard containers.I doubt if they will stand the test of time!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was a great end to the series. I like it when a series actually ends and doesn't leave you with more questions.
B005V5WBFG|2.0|I downloaded it because it said it was free. Once I downloaded it, it then said that I needed to upgrade to get the benefits to protect my tablet. It was very disappointing. It should have been made clear or called a trial version or something.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I almost didn't read this bc of the bad reviews. I even got the sample to try it. This book is awesome! I read a lot of it to my husband and he confirmed most guys do think this way. (They even know Pretty Woman pretty well......and my husband is a firefighter! A very manly man) It is hilarious how Drew tells the story so differently than if it had been in Kate's pov. It's very unique to only be in his pov. I've recommended it already to my friends, but warn them that it is crude and not to be a prude about it. I love it that way though. No flowery crap. It's from a guys pov! It's a quick, fun read. Not too deep. Very entertaining!! Made me laugh hysterically. You have to read it!!
0812982622|4.0|Over the past four weeks, I had the opportunity of reading the \\"Orphan Master's Son\\" by Adam Johnson. After finishing the book, did I realized the true genius of the author. He explored the depths of one of the most totalitarian nations in a voice that makes it hard to believe he is an American writer. His research on the secretive nation has provided the reader deep insight on the life of the North Korean from the lowliest criminal in prison mines to the most proclaimed person in the country, the \\"Dear Leader\\". He uncovers the true horrors that take place in the country that most people in this world will never know about.  After finishing the book, I can without a doubt say that this book has made me understand North Korea better and the reason why many want to defect from that country.<br /><br />  However, the plot could have been improved. Many times I was faced with the same questions: How did this happen and why? The plot me confused. In addition, it often jumped around a lot with a lack of connection between the events, which led to even more confusion. This book is split in two parts. For the first part, the reader could possibly understand the story with some assumptions about what happened. Conversely, the second part often switches perspectives and I was regularly confused on who was narrating. It took me a while to figure out how Part 1 connected with Part 2 as the storyline switches completely. The plot could have sufficed, had the author did a better job to connect the storyline together and clear up the different perspectives to the reader. The plot did posses made interesting themes of love and hate, loyalty and betrayal, and of pain and comfort. Comprising of these themes made the book rather enjoyable once the reader got over the many different perspectives and the confusing unexplained plot twists. The writing style can easily be comprehended but there were a few Korean terms in the book that some readers will not understand.<br /><br />  I wouldrecommend this book to people in high school and higher. Many aspects of the book can be difficult to stomach as there are torture scenes and other atrocities. Many adult readers can be disturbed or horrified by the conditions that citizens of North Korea constantly have to go through. I suggest that you don't give this book to a teen or child under the age of 15 as it can really disturb them at a young age.<br /><br />  To conclude, I give this book a solid four stars not because of the confusing plot but of the author's ability to uncover the veil that North Korea lives under. His intellect on the country overshadows the jumpy, unclear plot that can be hard to connect together. Should you spend your hard-earned money of this book? I say yes as it will give you insight into a very unknown nation. The plot could be enjoyable but I wouldn't count on it as it does require the reader to make inferences on what happened. To end, I must say that this book is a horrifying read with an mediocre plot.
8866135879|5.0|Hands down I would rate the Moleskine Day Planners the Best available.<br />All of our scheduling is still done via a Day Planner. Yes we use our iPhones for nearly everything else, but somehow, still prefer to live by the Planner for our scheduling.<br />There's something cathartic about writing something down and seeing it on paper, and such lovely paper it is!<br />We've purchased the 18-month weekly planners every June for the past 11 years and absolutely love them.<br />Great quality.<br />Well laid out.<br />A pleasure to use!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I grew up a few miles away from Edison's lab in Edison, NJ and after reading about Tesla, I've lost some respect for Edison.  His money and power gave him his recognition, unlike Tesla who earned it from his raw talent and genius.  It's easy to take credit for work you didn't do...
B000093BDX|5.0|I have attended 4 or 5 of their live shows, including 2012's 50th Anniversary Tour.  I am a big fan of their music because it brings back such warm memories and a great time in my life.  This is a very good compilation for Beach Boy fans!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I reluctantly bought this book for my book club after having my own book choice outvoted four to one. I thought this was going to be another book I'd quickly forget about after reading; to my surprise, I was wrong. Just after reading the first few pages, I was hooked.<br /><br />What's strange about this book in particular is that there is no apparent plot. In simplest terms, its just life in North Korea. This book shows the many different aspects of the average North Korean: from unimaginable loyalty to twisted tragedies unlucky citizens ultimately face. Adam Johnson does an amazing job depicting the struggle North Koreans face with living, compared to Americans, \\"normal lives\\". His extensive research within North Korea has done wonders to his book. While nobody knows for sure how North Koreans really live, his book is definitely believable.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to my peers, older of course, due to the disturbing torture scenes you might have read about in other reviews. The writing style is easy to follow with the exception of confusing narrator swaps in the second half of the book. Other than that, anybody within the age group of this book (ages 17 and up) should have no problem understanding the book. I say 17 and up for the age group because I feel that even teens in the range of ages 14-16 might find the certain parts of the story to be quite disturbing a.k.a the infamous torture scenes.<br /><br />The reason I give this book a 3 out of 5 rather than maybe a 4 -5 star review is because the book really falls off toward the end. Like previously mentioned, the narrator swaps quite a bit and it can get confusing. In addition, many strange occurrences in this part of the book occur without explanation. They seem to just happen. This left me at points in the story where I would ask myself how something happened and re read a few pages only to realize that it was never mentioned. I understand that Johnson wanted to leave a few details inthe dark, but it seemed a bit much in this story.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great read up to the second half of the book, which is where it really gets confusing and disturbing. This book is destined to collect dust on my bookshelf  along with my other one-time reads, but I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the \\"greatest nation in the world\\".
B000002AH7|4.0|An old favourite of mine.  Wanted to add to my collection.  A classic!  Easy to listen to.  And an excellent version of Concerto de Aranjuez.

B0095VPBM2|5.0|Bought it for a Linux-based home server. Cheap, fast, and gets the job done. More than enough power for my needs. Haven't tested the GPU though. Works like a charm in a ASRock FM2a75m-DGS (no BIOS flash needed).<br /><br />APU's are a great bang for your buck. Congratulations AMD!.
B00BEEKN26|5.0|Broadchurch is the kind of story that makes you feel as if you know all of the people personally. This series touched me in a way that no other television has before. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. The acting was incredible. I knew that I was seeing the story of a murdered boy, and not a TV show. The score spoke to me in many ways, and I fell in love with it so much that I later bought the soundtrack on iTunes. Broadchurch was an experience I'll remember for the rest of my life, and was possibly the best television series I've seen in my lifetime. I'd like to personally recommend this show to anyone who has ever lost one they loved, so that they may truly understand that while the rest of us may not understand what they are going through, we will always be there to stand by their side.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Solid board. Installed everything and booted up without problems. Love the color scheme and the low-profile dissipators on both the northbridge and southbridge.<br /><br />Looks like a good overclocker but not the best out there.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|At the end he explains that he told the story of half the characters and that the next book will have the rest. I wish he would have told half the story, but with all the characters and finished the story with all the characters in the next book.

B00139XTG4|5.0|The innovative thinking of the author is very refreshing. It makes us wonder of ways of thinking that we take for granted, and confront them to see if we go on sustaining its principles or we discard them establishing new ones. The way it promotes hilarity is by no means a great value.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|The drama keeps  you coming  back for more. Very intriguing and  sometimes gives you goose  bumps, we watch several episodes at a time.
0062107313|2.0|If you want HUNDREDS of pages of minutiae on being a Chinese courtesan (read: high dollar prostitute) in the early 20th century...then Amy Tan's new novel, \\"The Valley of Amazement\\" is for you.<br /><br />If you like ROMANCE novels...then this may be the book for you; I don't know what you call a \\"Bodice Ripper\\" for a culture that doesn't wear bodices...a \\"Robe Ripper\\" maybe?<br /><br />If you liked the how-to dating book called \\"The Rules\\"...then you might enjoy the section on how to be a courtesan. (Spoiler alert for both books: Men like women who are hard-to-get!)<br /><br />If you loved \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" with its wonderful insight on the complicated mother-daughter relationship and the riveting details of the cultural differences between China and the US, past and present... then this is NOT the Amy Tan novel for you.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This is a gripping read and the setting unique.  Stephen King shows another string to his writing bow, bring your imagination and settle in!
B008XBHIEY|4.0|A classic that's appropriate for all but the youngest family members!  This was really liked by all our family, including our 10-year old son.  This will never get old, and certainly there are many of the younger generations who have not yet viewed nor even heard of this classic.
1587143879|5.0|I have used it for test-prep and I am getting more confident about taking the CCNA 200-120 test. I think it is very easy to read; also it has great tools for continuing great study habits, and memory retension.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good read. Everyone has a secret, I like how it's that one degree that connects them all. The shoulda woulda coulda.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|A relic of Victorian literature whose time has come and gone. The style and story telling is overwraught and puffed up. Not much in the way of substance beyond the interesting descriptions of time and place in the first few chapters. At the time of writing, Stoker's portrayal of women as intelligent and capable may have been progressive. Today's reader will undoubtedly see it as grossly sexist--a product of its time that bears witness of the absurdity of Victorian gender and class roles. Other than having been the first of the now ubiquitous vampire genre, there's not a lot here. Reading felt more like a high school lit assigment than pleasure. I had to convince myself to finish. It felt like a very long book indeed.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is fine there just no caves once you've built a house it gets really boring I played this on my iPhone and it was great but iPhone has multiplayer but we don't so now I can't play with my brother's I'm really sad :( ... plus it's $7 not worth it<br /><br />Amazon ever heard of updates!  : <br /><br />Thx for listening

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's 1988 in rural Mississippi.<br /><br />In a contested probate of a last-minute, hand written will, an impoverished and deserving black housekeeper and caregiver, Lettie, is pitted against greedy and undeserving white relatives and their lawyers.<br /><br />A lawyer, Jake, designated by the deceased to enforce his hand-written will that favors Lettie, is besieged by family lawyers ranging from tricksters to downright scum, and the judge is enigmatic but likeable.<br /><br />The whole book is race-loaded, but there are some fair people.  However, nothing's \\"black and white\\".  Everyone's \\"gray\\" with good points and bad.<br /><br />When a jury trial begins the personalities and agendas clash.  The family's lawyers are able to sneak in last-minute witnesses and unsubstantiated evidence, and the courtroom drama is riveting.<br /><br />And a big surprise develops late in the story, a Grisham trademark.<br /><br />As Grisham often does, much of the book is devoted to RICH character development and his characters' different agendas, intermingled with the main plot.  And, as always, Grisham's writing is impeccable.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Love it. I can set it up to contact me on my phone or just on my kindle. Great for me with my busy scheduled and all three other appointment I have to keep track of
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I am a big fan of the American Horror Story series. This one really lived up to the high expectations I had after viewing Season 1. Jessica Lang gets better and better. I also liked seeing some of the actors from Season 1 in this one.
B008476HBM|5.0|I always prefer the classics to the newer novels. In particular, I enjoy reading period pieces and sharing them with my young home schooled student.
0399230033|5.0|A family favorite for years!  Love all books by Peggy Rathman and the way you can find pictures in one that relate to another.
B001OKCT2M|5.0|It's one of Stallone's best, and my favorite movies. I enjoy watching it over and over, with friends, family, and neighbors!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I have purchased extra lives and other items but my purchases never made it to my Candy Crush account.  I guess I spent my Amazon coins in vain. :(
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Great movie! Enjoyed introducing it to a friend, and I always enjoy watching it over and over again, of course!
B00C50NV2M|1.0|The black plastic frame broke as I was putting the glasses on my head!<br />My head isn't that big, and my glasses were not a one-off defective pair.  I took them on an off a few times during the trailers and on the third time, the frames just snapped as I was putting them on.  I was like &#34;are you kidding me?!&#34;<br /><br />These are very poor quality.  Sony should be ashamed to have their name on this item.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This amazing story provides a complex look at life in Germany during World War II as seen through the eyes of a very intelligent and perceptive child.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Played it on facebook and I glad to know I can play it on my kindle! It is easy to take it anywhere with me!
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Monsters University is a great movie. This movie has wonderful morals, and I enjoyed it a lot more than the original. The film is about the life of Sulley and Mike when they first met.<br /><br />In the film, Mike goes to a University and enters a program for scarers. Everyone finds it weird to see how a little monster like Mike is entering that program. Early on, Sulley comes into Mike's room through a window, and they meet for the first time.  Sulley is cocky, but he's also sweet and playful. At first, Sulley is a little bit of a bully toward Mike because he wants to impress the jocks, but then Sulley is shocked when the jocks are not loyal to him. Not long after, Sulley and Mike are then told they aren't allowed to continue in the scare program because they both lack something important. They later team up and try to get back into the program. They form a group and make an agreement with Dean Hardscrabble to get back into the scare program. We get to know both Mike and Sulley really well, and they learn to love each other a lot throughout the film.<br /><br />This movie is so upbeat, positive, and enjoyable. It has wonderful morals, a lot of character development, and a great ending. I totally recommend this movie to anyone.

B00C061I1M|5.0|With Pushin’ Against a Stone, Valerie June enters that pantheon of singers with truly distinctive, instantly recognizable voices (not to mention her distinctive free-form locks).  And people are, indeed, taking notice. Her countrified Tennessee twang is the perfect foil for banjo, guitar, and ukulele, all of which she’s mastered over the course of her 31 years. And with influences ranging from Bessie Smith, Elizabeth Cotton, and the Carter Family to Whitney Houston, Tracy Chapman, and Latasha Diggs, you can expect distinctive songwriting as well. June wrote about half the songs with Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys), who also served as one of the producers and guitarists on the album, which opens with “Workin’ Woman Blues,” an acoustic folk-rock song that concludes in a flurry of jazzy trumpet riffs.  On the winsome “Somebody To Love,” June’s voice drifts over fiddles and ukulele in a slow waltz, growing more emphatic midway with the support of a harmonizing chorus over the organ of Booker T. Jones.  “Wanna Be On Your Mind” employs subtle vocal inflections and echoing overlays, while “Tennessee Time” is a slow, deliberate string band waltz punctuated by the twang of steel guitar. Another highlight is “Shotgun,” which draws from murder ballads of yore and is sung in a compelling, improvisatory manner accompanied only by June’s chugging bottleneck guitar.<br /><br />The stellar title track is pushed to the middle of the album, where the reverb heavy vocals and trippy psychedelic guitar provide a refreshing change of pace. In sharp contrast is “Trials, Troubles, Tribulations,” a simple folk-spiritual sung as a duet between June and Auerbach, which segues into another album highlight, the rocking “You Can’t Be Told.” Pushin’ Against a Stone is expertly sung, arranged, produced and sequenced, with a refreshing variety of styles that coalesce around Valerie June’s compelling vocal timbres. - See more at: [...]rie-june-pushin-against-a-stone/#sthash.BKS0lwmT.dpuf
B00FEN000S|2.0|I guess effects are enough for some people.  I was never engaged in this movie at all.  The story is super weak and super predictable.  and it's a super shame, because they had the right ingredients to make this one good if not great
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it. A wonderful cast of characters. Looks like the story is about to have a whole new twist to it.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|I was excited to see it.  People told me how good it was.  It was just okay and in the end was just to unbelievable to really enjoy
B004132HZS|4.0|This series was very well done, but calling it a &#34;series&#34;, or a &#34;season&#34;, is a bit of a misnomer: Season one basically contains three hour-and-a-half movies  on two DVDs. Viewers might recognize parts of the stories with a modern twist, and the floating text helps show what Sherlock is thinking or doing. Even Sherlock's &#34;pipe&#34; smoking gets a twist - in this age he gets his fix with nicotine patches.<br /><br />Just be fore-warned that you are getting three good movies, and not a typical 12 or 16 episode &#34;season&#34; as you would with other shows.
B00F91FRTO|1.0|WOW, this movies was CRAP.  I really think they didn't know what they were doing.  It plays like a doc but without any of the info .... and as a movies... is ... well CRAP
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I love vampire books. Ever since I read my 1st Ann Rice novel. This book has a different twist but I liked it quite a bit. If you're tired of the same old vampire stories read this. It even has French men and kilt wearing hot Scots. Also favorites of mine. If there is another book I hope some bad boy bikers and pirates make an appearance.  One can hope. I didn't like her dad at all. That whole part seemed silly to me so I have to .knock 1 star off. That turned me off and there was enough going on without him and his crew. That stuff could have come out in another book in my opinion. Update I found the series of these. books and plan to read them
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The first 2 Aliens movies have never been equaled.  I can't even think of anything that came close.  I started to watch the 3rd and turned it off.  I just didn't want to tarnish my memory of these great movies.  I recently watched the first one for the first time on Blu-ray and I was amazed.
B00ESH04LQ|5.0|Take it for what is it,  Joss Whedon shooting Much Ado About Nothing in 12 days. Well worth a watch,
B00C74SHRK|3.0|I really loved the first half of this book.  The scene of the explosion in the museum is some of the best writing I have ever read.  Absolutely magnificent! However, found that the story of his adult life tailed off and that the end wondered off into philosophical thoughts that dragged somewhat.  Perhaps the book is a bit over long. All together a beautifully written book by a great writer.  Can't wait for her next book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun...to much time spent playing :) have no issues with how the game works or the functionality of it
B000YMHOUS|3.0|It was an okay  movie. I Won't watch it again because there was not anything that I needed to review.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't like facebook. It's too much trouble and work. It's ultra sloppy and annoying. I deleted it and my account.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Well done movie, good acting, visually very good. Yet as so many stories in Western culture the evil side has most of the mystical power, like with vampire movies, etc. Asian fantasy has good and bad folk of mystical power contending which is really more the reality in the world. Psychic power exists and some use it for unity and peace, other use it to division and destruction.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|M. Lewis' book, The Big Short, reveals the intricacies of the 2008 financial crisis in a manner that is both informative and terrifying.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Incredibly well done.  Just beautiful.  The story, the character development, the writing style.  I couldn't put it down.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.  I would compare the style to sort of a dark Patrick rothfuss but not quite so wordy. Not that I dislike rothfuss.  He's also a favorite of mine.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|A western that redefined the genre.  Allows you to feel good and care about the main character as the other characters do.  With an ending that you can not forget.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun and  just like Facebook. Fast. Addictive.<br />Once you start it is difficult to stop.<br />Try it you'll like it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sharpener works great. Very compact, really like that. Great gift idea as well. Easy to keep handy when you are busy dulling your knife.
B00FVAEKJ6|3.0|I don't like the finished pictures on this game.  I think they could have done better.  All of the other FlipPix games are much better.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|First listen, I found it overlong, full of what I took to be self-indulgent filler, and just generally disappointing.  Second listen with lowered expectations, I still felt pretty 'meh' about most of it but a few tracks were sticking in my head.<br /><br />Then I listened to it in a relaxed atmosphere, with no pressure on the music and no hurry to get from song to song, and started to fall in love even with tracks I had actively disliked at first.  This album blossoms with every listen, it's absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />The digital version lacks the 10-minute hidden gap track the CD has (in the full-album \\"teaser\\" video set against Black Orpheus, this is the track they inserted in the middle).  I think this is a shame and hope Amazon moves to correct it- many people don't like it and I can understand some will prefer to skip it, but for me having it in front set the unhurried mood that helped me appreciate the album.  Reflektor is not an overlong 7-minute radio single- it's part of a full album composition with very few tracks that don't fit in some way.  I'm just sorry it took several listens to appreciate it and to get some of the offputting videos & hype out of my head, because I know many listeners won't give it that much of a chance.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|All the other reviewers have stated the basic facts that this little thing works as advertised: SD reader for movies, music, pics, etc.  What people haven't elaborated on and my primarily use for this device is to be a mobile media center as I'm on the road weekly so need a  way to keep my media close to me.  Music and pictures are easy and a no-brainer, so let's talk about the more complicated movie formats.  Another reviewer listed all the compatible movie types.  For me, many of my movies are in the 'MKV' format.  Let's forget about the technical definition such as &#34;containers&#34; for a sec and focus on real world situations:  I have movies that are in this format and they won't play using the MobileLite app.  My options are to convert whatever I have into a compatible format, or use a 3rd party media player that supports whatever format I need since this device has the uPnP feature so 3rd party apps will see this as a wireless/network device.  I'm not recommending a particular 3rd party software, but I use Media 'PlayerExtreme'.  You'll have to purchase the option for network use, but it simply works.  I launch this media player and it has direct access to the MLW and able to play all file types I've thrown at it.  Performance is great and no issues so far.  Now I simply drop whatever movie formats I need to the SD card and hit the road.  No more converting videos.  Problem solved!
B00CLR127A|5.0|This album makes me feel happy and in way that only melancholy music can make me happy. I still love this band and so happy to have their music in my life
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter kept sending me requests. I ignored them tip she asked me to try it because it would give her more life's. Been hooked ever since!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is probably the best purchase I have made. I listen to this at least once a week. My coworkers love it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Very cool song. Lady Gaga is a big favorite of my wifes and she absolutely loves this song. Thank you
B000FCKGPC|2.0|After a very compelling first three books, I lost all interest in the series when reading this one. It focuses on characters that few people care much about, and it even adds several characters that do not play much of a role in the larger story. In sum, I feel like this was made solely for additional sales, but that decision comes at the expense of the overall series.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Veronica Roth’s Divergent series comes to a close with the third and final novel, Allegiant, a book which comes in with a bang and leaves with a whimper. Not in the sense that the ending is disappointing, but, well, it’s more than a little sad, with a bittersweet feeling that you don’t find in too many YA books of that genre.<br /><br />The story was told from alternating viewpoints, both Tris and Tobias getting first-person time in the spotlight. The voices were similar but still distinct enough to tell them apart without much trouble, and I loved reading Tobias’s narrative because his thoughts flowed in a way similar to my own, expansive and thoughtful compared to Tris’s energetic emotionally-charged viewpoint.<br /><br />Nature versus nurture was possible the strong theme running through this book, with the issue of genetic damage enhancing one characteristic at the expense of another, and that being what led to the experiment in forming the Factions. It was an interesting idea to play with, especially in that there was no final determination as to which played a larger part in a character’s personality. Genetic predisposition combined with upbringing as well as the general essence of a person all combined, and those who tried to insist that one side or the other won out were pretty quickly shot down. I liked that, since there’s a tendency to try for hard-and-fast explanations in most futuristic fiction, and those rigid explanations rarely stand up to scrutiny.<br /><br />Ultimately this was a powerful end to a powerful series, and I was glad to see it through even when my interest in dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction started to wane. If more books could be like this, I would be much more satisfied with YA genre books.
034580404X|5.0|Great book set. The three volume  boxed set has a  very impressing look Price and shipping as expected, These books have been so talked about had to see what all the fuss was about.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Best album since untouchables! Has that great sound that made great to begin with! Awesome riffs, vocals, drums, everything! Can't wait for the next one!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book, lots of twist and turns. Some parts were a little slow, but overall the story line was great.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The main reason I bought this was view You Tube.  Also, if we traveled I thought this would be good to have when I wanted to watch Netflix or Amazon. Pictures appear only in black and white on 5 year old Vizio.
B00G32OER4|5.0|One of the better paranormal movies simply because it was based on a true story. Lorraine and Ed Warren were the real deal.<br />This is certainly not the normal in ghost hunting and paranormal activity. Its one of those rare cases that really cause you to pause and think. This movie is way more then just a scary movie, its a education in the paranormal and its real!
B00003CXCQ|1.0|I ordered the Snow White DVD, advertised by BESTFINDS,LLC as a \\"Disney Special Platinum Edition\\".  The DVD was clearly copied, the inside jacket was full of miss spelled words and the bar code had been cut off.<br /><br />Do not buy from BESTFINDS,LLC - they charged me $40 for a copied DVD, complete scam artists!!<br /><br />Amazon promptly refunded my money for which I am grateful!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Keeps you coming back to play. You can only play for a short time or pay and since I can't afford to pay I come back to play.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|As someone who has experienced depression, I wish I could have described it this well. This was a great read.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|This was the worst movie I have seen in 15 years.  Even the highly anticipated special effects lacked the effect and by all means were less than special.  I have seen better acting at my 6 year olds school plays.  You can and should continue your life without watching this horrible movie.  The best part about this movie were the trailers I saw.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great series. I can't wait for more great reads in the future!  George R. R. Martin is quite a storyteller - u don't know how he keeps them all straight
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|would like it even better if there were more lives maybe 7 stock  lives otherwise its awesome. oh and i forgot ADDICTIVE lol
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|To Sell is Human is a new classic! Daniel Pink tells amazing stories coupled with data and case studies. It's not your traditional sales book. One two words to describe this book - Refreshing and Dynamic.<br /><br />If you would like to move others and have them feel great and yourself, invest in this book! You wouldn't regret it!<br /><br />Let's be human!
B0008ENHT4|5.0|Iconic actor, iconic film, iconic car chase. Solid story, solid performance from the man all men wanted - and still want - to be. Great supporting work by Simon Oakland, Norman Fell, and Robert Vaughn at his sleaziest best. A movie that cannot be made today with today's metrosexual &#34;stars.&#34; If they did, they would have to change the name from Bullitt to Blanks....
B009FAQ8IY|3.0|I read on IMDB that this is/was Martin Scorcese's favorite western (grain of salt taken) and I wanted to find out why...still searching.  I see the potential in the storyline and characters for a great redo but this execution fell flat...and in my humble opinion---if Marlon Brando and company cant make a go of this film, who could???  As a side note: The digitally remastering came across &#34;tiled&#34; and &#34;grainy&#34;.  I thought it may have been my internet connection for streaming but when I would rewind the film it still showed the same image quality.
B0002JP4L4|1.0|The special features by Kevin bacon would not open.  All the other ones opened, but not the one listed for Kevin Bacon.
B004LV32JU|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing one song, Where the sky Ends. I should have done more research on this band, because the only track I had heard was an awesome instrumental. If you are into the Screaming style Metal  this is for you...I was just expecting something different.
1476729085|5.0|Not since Confederacy of Dunces and Ignacious Riley, have I fallen for such a unique, funny, and lovable character as Don Tillman. I'm thrilled to hear that a sequel is in the works, and hope it becomes a series.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|My only complaint is I run out of lives after only two plays.  What gives?  My friend who has an IPad gets five lives, why not the same on a kindle?  Amazon should look into this.
B008LD09LS|1.0|Had problems working this with out a drone, could not get it to work for me as i tryed several times
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game but don't like that they keep wanting money to continue! I don't pay just wait awhile.
B00F880BWG|4.0|it should be cheaper...good show just cost too much. just might cancel and wait for it on netfix.  these 4 shows cost me what the first two seasons cost me on netflix
B00EMGUR60|5.0|This is a Motorhead album, nothing more, nothing less. But it may just be the best they've ever put out. To be fair, I haven't heard all of their albums. But Aftershock contains one satisfying song after another. The production is top notch, and the lyrics are about as awesome as you'd expect. The best is the second to last song \\"Keep Your Powder Dry.\\" This song is a bit different as it's much more uplifting and positive than you'd expect from Motorhead.<br /><br />Lemmy's voice sounds the same as it did 40 years ago. His bass lines are still amazing. Great drums, great lead guitar. I would highly recommend this album to someone who hasn't yet discovered Motorhead.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a really good game you should get it you will love.You even get to build up your robot it's really cool.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a phenomenal movie! I have seen every adaption of this film, and this is by far my favorite version of this movie! The acting is great! I love the end scene in this movie as well!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I have read the book more than 30 yrs ago and I am so pleased that I got the DVD. Leonardo is doing a fantastic role. The whole movie was so rich and voluptuous!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read all of the Harry Bosch novels.  At this point I read anything written by Michael Connelly. From character development to first rate story line and its inherent surprises, Connelly is one of the best crime writers out there.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I won't be able to say anything that wasn't already said. Even my teenage children loved it , we watched it twice! ( the entire collection!). Anxiously awaiting for season 4.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This series is not well written. It's just isn't, and this third installment is the worst of the three. The author decided to use two viewpoints, but utterly fails in differentiating between the two. The characters are still unconvincing and shallow, the plot still requires too much suspension of disbelief, and the ending is indescribably bad. Indescribable!<br /><br />I wasn't very invested in the book beyond just finishing the story. I didn't love books 1 or 2, but they were ok enough and my completionist complex strong enough to get me to read the last book. After finishing book 3, even with not being a huge fan, I was in a foul and depressed funk for at least 3 days. I wish I'd never heard of Veronica Roth. The entire series relies on emotional manipulation of the reader, which is really the only thing she excels at, and she uses that skill to crush her readers as her grand finale.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Who knew I would get so addicted to this? It's way more fun than Tetris. I am still figuring it out but I love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book!  Can't wait to read the next one!  You can really get involved with the characters, and feel what they are going through.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story was great! The author always brings happiness in me when I read! Now I can watch the movie :)
B00D2I8E46|5.0|This is a must have album in any form. A wonderfully done collaboration. This isn't a rap album. This is pure music, Questlove of The Legendary Roots crew brought his A game with his band on this and Elvis Costellos lyrics are just fantastic. Get it now!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little sharpener. Light, small, cheap but well made and durable. Comes with a carbide piece which is used for making or fixing blades and a ceramic piece which is used for maintenance on sharpness and sharpening, comes with serration sharpener rod as well. Great product.
B00AKKS278|4.0|This book, like many self-helps, could be easily condensed into one or two chapters (in other words, it gets repetitive after four chapters), but I really like the concept. It's a concept based on doing all the things everyone tells you to do to reach your goals and be successful, only it is organized into a format that makes it all feel doable. The author's stories and experiences add to the idea that following the &#34;miracle morning&#34; layout will change the way you feel about your day and help you tackle life with purpose. Worth a read if you enjoy or are new to self-help/motivational books.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really like this. I do have some problems scrolling when I've maxed my errors (and want to memorize my pattern).  But that is minor.  More puzzles, please.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works ok. I sometimes have issues controlling it with my tablet - loses connection when my tablet sleeps. It needs more apps. I was hoping it would work similar to google tv - I have a Logitech revue. The revue works better, even though it is no longer supported by Logitech.
1848366159|3.0|there is a lot of information in this book, however the index is extremely poor and it is almost impossible to search for a specific item.<br />The only way to find anything is to read the entire book

B008C20TDG|5.0|I am 24 days in and feel amazing!  I have had a long battle with chronic lyme; 23 years of it.  At 46 I was/am disgusted with where I was in my life (physically) and through research came across this book.  Within hours I had read the book and started Whole30.  The question is do I miss the foods I gave up or do I miss the pain?  The answer is, this will be a lifestyle from here on out.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great read for adventure fans and Pendergast lovers like myself. Preston and Child have created a superb character in Special Agent Pendergast.

B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|I use this all the time, and it really took the stain off my neck. It takes a little practice to do a flip turn in one, but I have learned to. When I get tired and my form lags, I can get water in it. With practice you can learn to blow it clear, but that can be hard.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a great read. I highly recommend reading this. I wasn't able to put it down. The characters in the story are vivid and I am sure there is a great deal of truth to this story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have never been so happy to see I was able to get this on my kindle fire, this is the best game and very challenging.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I am still just getting use to the app but what I see so far i really like.  Will enjoy using this one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|loved the unexpected and yet so voluptuous descriptons of things as mundane as a sunrise. i highly recommend this book to those who love inventive use of language.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|fun fun fun!!! everyone should try out this mystery game!!!!!! you have to search photos to find items. its like I spy!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I was engaged all the way through this story.  I honestly don't try to reverse engineer the books I read, because I do that for a living as a Software Engineer.  I just trust the author to take me for a compelling ride.  I have never been disappointed with a Grisham book.  I read freebies often, but when a Grisham shows up, I sign up early.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Naomi Watts is...AMAZING...the story is known - but still... we watched and enjoyed it very much. Sad...but uplifting at the same time.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|It was well acted and followed the book very well. It was easy to match the cast with the characters in the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had seen this game on Facebook via friends posting scores and curiosity finally got the best of me. It's a good thing there's a time limit or I would be playing it 24-7!
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is an excellent read for any kid or a adult who is a kid at heart. Warming story with 4 kids who helped saved a country. And a brave lion who sacrificed himself for the lives of others. Highly recommend.
0439023521|4.0|Good cheap price for a book I needed for school. In good condition. Very helpful I would recommend this to anyone
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Season 3 was just as captivating as Seasons 1 and 2 and it was confirmation that I was hooked on watching the series. Every character is interesting and if the character isn't interesting, it's because the writers have made that character interesting YET. As people, we are taken through trials and joy in our lives and it is no different for this group except it's set in a time so different than our own which makes it all the more intriguing. I wish the series ran longer in a season than it does, but I guess it doesn't matter because millions are coming back for more after months of waiting. I love that this is part of my video collection.
B0018RC7QE|2.0|Very contrived. Big stars; big disappointment. I simply wasn't convinced of their love for each other. And some of the dialogue seems very trite.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|we love pixar films.  monsters was wonderful, fun and exciting.  this film does not measure up as much.  it's not very original and a bit predictable.
B007CKNX28|3.0|the best tracks on this are the ones that sound like the white stripes .the rest are average .piano's instead of guitars from one of the best guitarists of all time ? dissapointing!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book took many underlying thoughts and feelings and put them all in a nice open discussion that all women would benefit from.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I don't know what it is about this book, but it fuels my soul in a way that only the best intellectual feasts can do. It's that feeling of being astutely aware of your pulse and actually feeling your brain muscles flexing a bit. I laugh every time I read about the detailed description of which computer Salander or Blomkvist are using, and yet it makes the story what it is. Without these morsels of detail, this book wouldn't be the feast that it is.<br /><br />As if replicating life itself, the book is slow moving at first and you wish it would move faster. Then, before you know it, you're plummeting down the plot line and wishing you hadn't whisked through it so fast. When you reach the end, all you want is to keep going.
B009RH973I|3.0|i was impresed with the color , but overall the kindle doesn't fit  it slides around & the &#34;backstand &#34; doesn't hold up properly,
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|The basis of the popular Showtime series, this is the novel that started it all, Dexter, the serial killer who kills serial killers. I understand that the first season of the TV show (which I haven't seen) is very close to this first novel of the series. (From there, apparently, they diverge.) Full of dark humor, the novel keeps the twists and turns, being entertaining and creepy, while showing a lot of insight into Dexter's character. I really enjoyed it, even more than I expected to, and look forward to reading the next one in the series.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|A great show/series solid cast of characters, story line keeps u in gauged and entertained. Watch it and enjoy yourself
0670451495|5.0|My kids love it. Simple story with so much to for them to learn.  The illustrations are beautiful. Hard to pick which is favored more in our house, Make way for ducklings, or One morning in Maine.
8186336141|5.0|A classic text on the subject that covers the deeper aspects.  Written by a direct disciple of the great sage and yoga master Sri Swami Sivananda. A must have for the serious student.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|At last I can watch a movie on my kindle fire!! Yay so happy!!!<br />And it works like a dream
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love this game but you kind of have to be a hunter to like all the shooting and killing part
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great.  It makes you use your brain in order to figure out the clues,  instead of memory or rote.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addicted to this game. look forward to each new level and enjoy competing with friends. play this daily. bring on new levels
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really enjoy this app to the point of being addicted, how ever I an not a fan of having to wait days to get through a barrier.
145210655X|5.0|Bought for a Christmas present.  The package arrived well within the time limit and was very well packaged.  I was pleased with the product and service!  Grandson loves Star Wars and wants to present his first child these books.
0670024856|5.0|Great read! Fascinating details, interesting characters; historical and geographic placement(s) were realistic and beautifully realized; a full and well told tale. Sexy, spiritual and spirited. I was sorry when it ended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.  Never exactly the same, so you don't get the &quot;bore&quot; factor involved in many other games.  But be warned, it's addictive, and will suck you in.  :-) Been playing for months and have always been disappointed that I couldn't play on my Kindle.  Pleasantly surprised to find it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a good game. just hard enough.cant think of more words to say that  I liked it just fine
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The BEST of the three.  The other two left endings up in the air.  This one actually has an ending.  I almost didn't read it because of the very disappointing endings of the Gone Girl and Dark Places, but I am so glad I ordered it.  This is the BEST of the three, for sure!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. We love to watch it for family night. It has quickly become our favorite thing to watch together.
0385537131|5.0|This is one of the best Grisham books in years.  It grabs the reader immediately and doesn't let go until the last page.  The suspense builds inexorably and the characters are all engaging.  Jake Brigance is a likable character and one who would do well as a protagonist for a series set in Clanton County, Mississippi.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|All the funny part were in previews, so i wasnt that impressed. Seemed like a Men in Black rip off very dissapointing!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is really cool and has the potential to be very addictive, tons of fun I<br />like it a lot.
B00CNEVHMG|5.0|I saw YES at Madison Square Garden when this album was out, and I do have a player to take SACD so I could'nt resist this special release. The band was energized with Rick Wakeman back in the fold. It is a good record and I think one that has \\"aged\\" very well. Steve Howe in particular comes across very strong on this record- I have always felt this is among his best in studio guitar work with YES. There is the punchy opening title track featuring some ripping slide guitar from Howe- while some of their songs could seem a bit cerebral on the studio albums, the song \\"Going for the one\\" is among the harder rocking things YES recorded in the studio. Plus Chris Squire contributes one of the greatest tunes he ever wrote for YES with \\"Parallels\\", again Howe turns in some impressive lead guitar work. And \\"Awaken\\" proved to be a show stopper to stand alongside their other epics. The only tune I'm not crazy about is \\"Turn of the century\\", but it has its fans.<br />YES was a band that had it all. They were musical geniuses- maybe that's why they could never stay together long. Plus they could bring it onstage- even their more complex pieces were brought off by the amazing musicianship of every member, as well as theatrical considerations. The challenge of how to present a studio creation in concert, that aspect of performance in particular seems to be a lost art these days. YES really knew how to conceptualize their music on stage. Although \\"Going for the one\\" is recorded in studio, somehow this album manages to sound a little more like YES in concert than some of their other studio records.<br />As far as the sound quality- even the original album on LP always had a slight cardboard quality to it. That was one of the things I noticed about it listening to the album in 1977. Maybe that was down to the absence of their usual studio engineer Eddie Offord (who did some great work for YES, ELP and others). Subsequent issues on CD did'nt seem to offer anything special- and were sometimes made worse by making it sound brighter and harder.<br />This SACD remaster was taken on by Mr. Steve Hoffman and is a specialty \\"audiophile\\" disc. I am familiar with Mr. Hoffman from his forum and the magazine interviews I had read in the 90's, the DCC Lp/CD work he did (I first saw his name on a DCC Freddie King CD called \\"Getting Ready\\"), and more recently the remastering projects he has done under the Audio Fidelity moniker. He has a reputation for being painstaking about finding truly the best source- the genuine master tape, the exact reels mixed to two track in the studio at the time the record was made- he sends anything else back- sometimes holding out a year or more until he gets what he wants. Now he said on his forum this SACD is like the real thing. The disc is close to how the original master tape sounds he says.<br />I did not hear the master tape, but in listening to the stereo SACD layer of the disc, I feel this is the best \\"Going for the one\\" has sounded- and I include the old LP in that too- which is not to say it sounds as good as the earlier albums engineered by Eddie Offord. Steve Hoffman has managed to bring some low end heft without the usual bloat- now we can more fully appreciate the mind blowing bass of Chris squire. And Hoffman has the mid range as being nicely organic, while the treble is natural- neither dull nor bright. Vocals are full of life, and there is an ample sense of space to everything. On the albums centerpiece \\"Awaken\\", Mr. Hoffman does a good job of laying out the tracks sonic intricacies for the listener to savor- and with its spiritual nature, church organ and choral vocal parts at the climax- listening to this one almost makes you feel like you're in church.<br />5.1 is not a priority for me- but it surely will be to others so that is a factor. But keep in mind the tapes Hoffman used were mixed for stereo- the early incarnation of surround sound (called quadraphonic) had quickly come and gone by then. So maybe thisone is mainly for 2 channel audio listeners. Otherwise I highly recommend the SACD of this excellent Yes album, one that I think will be greatly appreciated in years to come.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great series. I watched  most of it on Netflix. I didn't think I would like it, but I was intrigued from the first episode. It has a great plot and acting. I watched the whole series in about 7 days, watching episode 4 on Amazon. I'm glad I was able to see the the latest episodes becacause I was left hanging after the end of the end of the third series. Yea! Amazon!
B004GYY714|4.0|I like that I can tune to my favorite local mountain resort radio station that is a two hours drive from my home.  TuneIn Radio lets me take a mini vacation anytime I want.<br />Thanks.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I rarely watch tv, and I'm not a fan of the horror genre, but I absolutely LOVE this show! This is art at its finest. The acting, writing, and storyline are superb, and the interpersonal dynamics between the characters is breathtakingly intense. Season 4 is off to a great start. Purchasing the show from Amazon is a deal, I can watch when I have the time, again and again!
B00CIH371W|5.0|Oh my! I absolutely LOVED this book and I am terrified of spiders! I actually fell asleep reading this last night. I cold not put it down. I was so entranced I could not stop reading today until I finally finished it.<br /><br />Basically for a short rundown. No Spoilers. Sorry. Sara Jones found out some disturbing things about her boyfriend and his family and she ran. She knows that they will be looking for her. When people start dying from spider bites she wonders if they have found her. There are so many series of events that she starts to wonder if this is the case and who she can trust.<br /><br />This book takes you on so many twists and turns you don't know what to expect. My husband thought that I was weird because I was reading a book with Spiders in it knowing how terrified of Spiders I am. The description of this book intrigued me from the start. I a so glad that I put aside my fear of spiders to read this. I definitely recommend reading this book even if you are afraid of Spiders. I would definitely be interested in reading more books involving Tegen's if Inge-Lise Goss ever decided to write another book involving them!<br /><br />~ Reviewed by L.S.K. Sweetheart Reviews ~
B00CU8QB9Y|5.0|I can't say I've ever been a huge fan of Dawkins - the only book I've read of his in full has been The God Delusion, and although I've read the beginning of most of his books since I'm sad to say that none of them captured my interest long enough for me to finish them. The only knowledge I had of &#34;The Selfish Gene&#34; was gained from watching his 1991 Christmas Lectures which I thoroughly enjoyed. Although I admire the way he succinctly and poetically writes his arguments, I had recently become a little bit put off by the dismissive and sometimes aggressive way he argues with religious representatives. His latest book, however, has completely reversed this negative perception I had of him.<br /><br />Although I personally found the beginning to be a little slow, in time it reveals itself to be a wonderful account of his life. In particular I loved the amount of detail he puts into his childhood days and the reflective style of writing - he often contemplates his reasons for acting the way he did, sometimes citing experts' research on the subject in question. This made it a very engaging read, one that made me contemplate my own past and present behaviours. For example, he discusses the bullying nature of children and reflects on how he, despite being an empathetic boy, never did anything to stop bullies from targeting a defenseless victim. He then goes on to discuss whether we are the same 'person' now as we were as a child - even though we are literally made up of different material than that of our younger selves the continuity of memory makes it feel as though our identity is the same. This was a point that I discussed with people for many days after reading about it.<br /><br />This engaging form of writing made me think (more than I ever have) like a scientist - wondering about things I'd never contemplated before, becoming enthused (rather than put off) by scientific explanations for behaviour and realizing more than ever how much there is to discover (and being thrilled by the concept). I am not a very educated person - a 21-year-old working in retail, having had a year of university experience before it became too hard for me - and Dawkins' book has re-awakened the part of me that inspired me to go to university in the first place.<br /><br />The content itself is fascinating - his transitions from one part of his life to the next are well explained and his obsession with programming and scientific ideas are awe-inspiring and left me to perceive him as nothing short of a genius.<br /><br />All in all, from someone who's not very well-read or well-educated, this book was incredibly valuable and inspiring. Although a few parts went over my head (despite re-reading certain paragraphs several times!), the vast majority was a pleasure to read. I feel like I understand Dawkins and his 'appetite for wonder' much better than before, and I've never been more eager to read all of his books to completion.<br /><br />The only downside is that it only covers his life up to the release of his first book - I cannot wait to read the second half!
B003M70O5O|5.0|The writers of this show are awesome! So many different spins and twists! You've been told your whole life to look down on bad guys and cast them out of the community. But you begin to love the &#34;family&#34; and you root for them all the way and you hate the even bigger bad guys! Everyone should see this show.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|What an amazing ending and amazing writer! A top pick--great adventure story, best series, heart warming romance, did I say amazing writer! I read several YA/new adult paranormal books A DAY this past year and this series (or pretty much anything written by Jennifer Armentrout) is amazingly well written-- the story shines and the characters jump off the page! You will love, love, love the main characters, their non-stop adventures, and their heart stealing romance. And if you love a great book, you'll want to read their whole story over and over again!
1439199388|5.0|very complete summary of the history of discovering why there is an epidemic of auto-immune diseases afflicting the most affluent societies<br />It also suggests how to keep your children from experiencing these problems (before they are 2) and what to do if they come down with the diseases later<br />This will be of great interest to everyone with severe allergies, asthma, MS, celiac intolerance, autism, inflammatory bowel disease, etc<br />These discoveries are still controversal in the medical community, but this book is very confincing with numerous case studies<br />Also well written
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I always look forward to a new Stephen King book. I enjoy &#34;hearing&#34; him tell me a story.  His characters have stayed with me through the years, (uh-oh that's a Harold or she reminds me of Frannie, etc.) I will never look at an RV the same way since reading&#34; Doctor Sleep&#34;, and I enjoyed this tale.  Also, if you're reading this check out his &#34;Joyland&#34;.....just terrific.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game I've played.  Five rounds in the free tournament and free spin slot for prizes everyday make this bingo game unlike any others.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I had never seen the movies before and saw this collection. Man was I glad I purchased them. The movies were amazing.
B00A6CT012|4.0|This is an excellent book to help think about garbage in a new way. This book was very illuminating to the waste that occurs in our homes.  The author has done extensive research on the subject of eliminating waste.  She has come up with a 5 prong approach.  Refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot. While there is volumes of information about recycling, I had never thought of refusal before. Free pens, free coffee, I never realized the effect these things had on the Earth.<br />She does offer many practical solutions to incorporate these into your life. Each life area has a section with advice on the five rules and an excellent resources area.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting game!  I am glad the free version has a time restraint in between lives because I would be playing this all the time otherwise!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I love this game. It is almost as addictive as the Explodz cola. I enjoy the different levels and trying to knock out the hipsters.  I am a little confused about the certificates and the metro stops but maybe I haven't reached a high enough level. As far as a free game goes, this one is pretty great.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Have yet to be disappointed by G5  games. Particularly enjoy hidden object games. Provides different difficulty levels. Reduces  game from being boring.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|my wife and I love this show and everyone I know love this show has you on the edge of your seat every season
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This is a great way to keep your brain sharp. Ton of games and fun to play. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get some fun sharpening their brains.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|Loved it, did not know what to expect from it what was completely taken by surprise and once I was drawn and I was hooked.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Great new offering by the legend. I like every song. He is still playing great, hard-driving blues at 77. You won't be disappointed. For you true audiophiles, this album is offered in vinyl too.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|My grand daughter loves it.  My daughter approved it.  Besides, it is about cats.  That is all that matters to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun waste of time!!  Especially if you are stuck somewhere and have nothing else to do!  It can be very irritating!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I  love historical films and this is a favorite. I have watched the entire series more than once.  Actor were well chosen and completely believable in their roles. Costumes and scenery were lavish and accurate for period.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|I can be fun but I didn't get completely into it.  I love the concept though and I'll keep it on my phone and I'm sure I'll play it more in the future.
B009JCPM5S|1.0|I decided to watch this movie around 2013 Halloween because it terrified me as a child. The movie is awful with bad dialogue and terrible effects.  Watch it for a laugh because it's not scary.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|The trailer for this movie had me convinced it was just gonna be a some dumb, kid's movie; however, this movie was lots of fun to watch, with plenty of laughter and entertainment. This movie really surprised me!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|It was enjoyable and I would recommend it but it wasn't anything crazy amazing.  Some of the graphics were kind of cheesy and will smith's son talks odd and was hard to understand at first.
1439152802|3.0|Takes a little while to get into - I struggled through the first half without really &#34;feeling it.&#34;  I loved her previous books, but this one just took too long to get going.  And when it did get rolling, the ending was predictable.  I had figured out &#34;the secret&#34; with still a hundred pages left!  As I said, I liked Morton's previous books, but the shtick is starting to get old.  Young woman learns that her Mother/Grandmother did something years ago and must track down the event piece by piece - and always aided by the fact that some relative of a character from 60 years ago still lives in the family home and still remembers key events. While that schema worked the first three times, it's starting to get frayed around the edges by book four.<br /><br />I will say the book was mostly entertaining, if a little predictable and far-fetched.  I really hope the author changes up her recipe in her next book, because I loved the mystery of the first few books.  This one just seemed somewhat recycled.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Mr Martin tells a wonderfully and engrossing tale. I truly enjoy the way some of his villains evolve into heroes even though their actions are done out of selfishness. Also you can never predict what will befall any of the characters even the best heroes are not safe from any fate. I can't wait to see how it all turns out.
0470474874|5.0|I was taking online classes to learn Excel. My textbook for the class was not as good as John Walkenbach.books.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|When I started reading I didn't want to continue because the cultural norms were crazy evil and I didn't want to think about them. But I continued and prayed for people who's world view is so messed up. The book is well written and so insightful. Although it is fiction (and an entertaining story), the author did much research and brings awareness to the North Korean mindset and way of life that is so foreign it is hard to believe people exist in a world like that. I needed to glean more understanding.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game should have unlimited lives. Why force your player to STOP playing?? Sounds a little counter productive. I never ask for lived on facebook. annoying!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This book taught me a great deal about the normal life and the suffering of the people in areas under terrorist control.  It also gave me a great love and respect for this young girl (and her family) who strive to live the true spirituality of their Muslim religion...a life of courage with love and forgiveness for all of God's creation.  She is living the same life that Jesus came to show is possible for all of us.  Thank you, Malala,, for your beautiful example of the life God wants all of creation to experience,
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|The Eagles are great group. They have been around for a long time.If you are a fan of this group you should add this  DVD to your collection.You won't be disappointed.
B000V6583C|5.0|Classic, that's all I have to say.  Love all songs from this album.  Hope I'll encounter an album like this in future.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was a great fan of the first two books in the series and preordered allegiant. I found the book to be entertaining overall, though not as well written or developed as the initial book. However, I was very disappointed in Roth's character decision. I read for fiction entertainment, but also to escape. By the end of the book the only thing I found myself wanting to escape was the depressing book I had invested my time in. I will not be investing my time, emotions or money in any more of her books. I also won't be going to see the movie. Who needs to be reminded of this?
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game. After I watch him and my husband play. I started playing it and now I'm hooked!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|get it its awesome I got it 3 days ago and I absolutely love it you should get it my family has it and they love it too
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good show, can't complain. Excessively dramatic at times, but overall a good show that doesn't let me down. Watching it regularly.
0345803507|5.0|I can't help it - I'm addicted to this series. The third book in the trilogy was as good as anticipated and I flew through it upon arrival! If you liked the first two books, you will be sure to also find this one to be a page turner!
0062224050|5.0|I knew there was a book I was missing and this is it.  Actually got this one autographed.  I love the genre, this was a new author for me, so I was tickled to death to get it.  Library didn't have it.  Great series with Patrick & Angie, and I look forward to seeing them again (author told me that he'll look into them to see what they're up to, not to worry!).
B00CBR9NIA|4.0|I gave this film four stars because it held my interest from start to finish.<br />I was skeptical at first as to whether I really wanted to take time out, expecting it to be all about Hitchcock's filmography.<br />Instead, the film is really a love story about the relationship between Hitch and his wife Alma.<br />He was obsessed with his icy blonde leading ladies but Alma was the woman behind the man's success and she was able to go head to head with him and hold her own.  Helen Mirren is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Alma. Her expressions and excellent timing will tickle you and make you want to say, &#34;You go girl!&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not as nice as a Roku or Apple TV.  Relies on an eternal device to stream to the Chromecast.  I prefer the Apple TV or Roku because only a wifi connection is needed.  Netflix,Hulu, MLB etc all run within the device.  They also have their own remotes in addition to smart phone apps.  Chromecast you need an Android device or your computer to control it.  No physical remote and no Iphone or Windows Phone app.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is definitely one of the best sketching apps for note 2. With so much features it is definitely a must have!
B00FMZ22CM|3.0|would be helpful if some of these apps came with instructions. sort of trial and error to learn to use
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is a very useful app. Very well made. I believe that this feature should be available by default in YouTube!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was lots of fun to watch.  Big name actors and entertaining special effects wrapped up in a keep 'em guessing who-done-it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was on the best seller list for so long I thought it must be a good read, but alas, not so.  I finished it but wondered why
B00EZPCZ5O|3.0|I was so excited for this album to come out,*sigh* but once having it now I don't really care to listen to it. I've loved all of AFI's albums up to this point, but while playing this album through I just couldn't get past how much it lacks lyrically. The lyrics are so literal! Davey is always so poetic with his lyrics, and I understand he was hurt in a relationship but man you don't have to say it so literally and be the topic of every song.  Sonically I loved the album because Jade is so badass on the guitar, Hunter sets the base line great, and Adam's percussion is bigger on this album.I love love love hearing Davey's voice, but I just can't get past how disappointing the lyrics are.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I never really knew that much about cancer because I never really needed to know any thing about it. My grandma died of cancer before I was born but other than that I never I never encountered cancer until this book. This book opened my eyes to what could happen to people and does every day and it makes me just want to cry. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody. I hope it can touch your heart like it did mine.
1401242855|5.0|I saw this box in my friendly neighborhood comic book store and snatched it off the shelf right away.  It had been about a year since I read The Court of Owls, and knew that I had to have that iconic mask.<br /><br />The Court of Owls is actually a packaged version of Batman #1-#7 of the New 52. (New 52 is a complete relaunch of the DC Universe, causing all issues to revert back to Issue #1).  The Court of Owls is a gripping story that is very at home in a newer and gritter DC comics.  This story really does a fantastic job of making Gotham City come alive and really breathe, like a character of its own.  It also caters to new fans coming into the series, and veterans, giving them each something to really come into and discover.<br /><br />This book also helps introduce a set of villains that feel like they've been there all along.  They are incredibly well written, and genuinely terrifying.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that this stands toe to toe with other great Batman story arcs, such as Hush or The Long Halloween.  I've specifically bought copies of this book to lend/give to people to try and bring them into the mythos.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great DVD . . . My nephew loved it!  He asked for this DVD for his birthday and watches it over and over!
B009JCPM5S|3.0|Fun, old school horror flick.  Malachai and Isaac are two of the freakiest kids on film....for sure.  I wonder what ever happened to the guy that played Malachai?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great DVD for kids!  My niece's daughter asked for this for her birthday and watches it over and over; she just loves it!
B00B5P37IG|3.0|This application for my Kindle does work as advertised but I don't use it that much.  I purchased it because I love technology and am amazed by the things these applications  can do!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|levels are taking to long it should be a little faster and have inspectors pop up and cocaroches pop up to have to clean up as well for a real life affect
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This was my 2nd timer application for my phone.  No complaints.  You can keep adding new timers and put different names on each one.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is the best boxing game it's tough.<br /><br />best game for boxing u should make it since u so we can shadow box
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's Tom Cruise, my wife likes him but he needs a reality check to get the bogus crap out of his films, you know like Daniel Craig.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just could not stop reading this book! I love the end and if you are considering reading, you should! It is soo good!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well crafted characters. It was hard to put it down. The interwoven story lines were expertly planned and executed. I'm ready to read more from this author!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is totally right for your kindle fire if y'all have one. U can pick your own screen and its like really really really really really really really cool and awesome app I ever God in my life.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I chose this rating because it was the only logical choice. Despite what some hardcore old school Star Trek fans may say, this movie adequately pays homage to the originals. Good movie!
B00F9A903O|5.0|This is a really good app. I play on my Kindle Fire and it does great. My Kindle hasn't locked up or had any issues loading the app.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|This movie is intense!! Just enough twists and surprises, and packed with action! Brad Pitt is awesome in his role.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute and realistic. It never gets boring and you always are doing something new! You have goals that keep you playing! So many varieties of places and costumes! I highly recommend it for all ages!
B00D3PYQT0|5.0|I hadn't watched it on tv, but people I know were talking about how good it is. This summer I had the chance to watch a little of season 1 and got hooked! Once you start watching, you can't stop......it's that good! Now I can't wait for season 4!
B009NNMB70|5.0|I love you one direction I your huge fun of you band one direction I love you liam payne you want kiss me on my lips I love you too harry styles & louis tomlinson & zayn malik & niall horan you not get engaged to katy perry boy get engaged to katy perry I be the flowergirl at your wedding laugh out loud
B00FN811SY|4.0|Great! Very informative. It helps to gain insight on almost every verse. Love using it to study with. Thanks so much.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|As I think back now what I should have Done was not read the intro. I  set up the totally wrong premise in my mind instead of letting the story carry its self. Totally enjoyed it all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Thus is a really wonderful book! Full of twist and surprises. I can see this story continuing on, so I look forward to that.<br />I have never read Flynn before, but I will from now on!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun, easy, relaxing way to kill time - which is what I look for in a game, since I rarely play them.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|This game does not give any hints. I got stuck on a floor and finally abandoned the game.  I also couldn't save the level I was stuck on when I left it so I had to start over on that level everytime.!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|What can i say? It is Star Trek-gotta love it. Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding. There is good interactions with all of the characters.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|As with similar games, this game does not give any hints. I got stuck on a level and finally abandoned the game. plus, if you leave the game, you have to redo the last level you were on.
B00DNV9V1W|5.0|Great packaging with easy instructions. Protector applied perfectly just by following the directions. There is even a video online to help you if you have problems... but really it is a simple task and they provide you with everything you need. The protector is hardly noticeable by feel and absolutely not noticeable just by looking at the phone. Tech Armor is the way to go for these things, your screen will definitely be safe.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|This book had me gripped from start to finish Stephen King at his very best well worth the wait - really highly recommend it to anyone who remembers the Shining
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was the best king read I've had in years!if you liked the Shining,hang on to your seat because it and King are back!
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|Great acting. Most married couples will relate. Laugh out loud and tear up. This is not a movie for children.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked the first book (the Hunger Games) and honestly I didn't think this book was going to be as good because most<br />sequels aren't very good, but I was wrong. Suzanne brought back the excitement and adventure we all loved in the first book. My favorite part of the book was towards the end because it gets so intense, but you have to read the book to find out what I mean.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I had heard someone talking about this ebook and how I needed to get it! lol, so after getting another email through Hay House, I decided to find out what all the talk was about.  And what I had was pure fun, both reading this book and doing the experiences.  Now I already &#34;knew&#34; that our thoughts and feelings determine our experiences, but how many of us are really &#34;embodying&#34; that to the truth of what just is, without ever &#34;thinking&#34; about it all the time...exactly! me too! so mostly what I got from this book was a GREAT WAY TO EXPERIENCE IT because now I had some exercises that I could enjoy TRYING OUT and seeing for myself as I also read along what the author shared about this! That was what I found the most enjoyable, was the fun I had experiencing the exercises that was a PERFECT WAY for me that did PROVE my thoughts were having something to do with my day's experiences, aka, my life!<br />loved it, great sense of humor, great sharing of examples and stories and fun experiments to give a go!
B000SW2ER2|4.0|Mostly well done, though some of the plot elements seemed odd to me.  Much of the science in the movie was sound, and many of the things well thought out.  Good acting, and mostly good casting adds to the quality of the movie.  Some of the things that seem like plot holes in the begining of the movie leave you wondering at the end of the movie.  It has a mysterious dream quality that some people who would rather have guns blazing and explosions probably will not like.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I've always meant to watch this show - but never got around to it - but thanks to Amazon - a weekend with no cable TV - I watched the season and it was even better than I expected.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Although the movies plot was to &#34;restart the sun&#34; due to a depletion of it's fusion fuel, that science says will not happen for billions of years, it was a good suspence movie.  I like action/suspence films and the CGI was pretty good, the acting was also very good even if the story could have been done better.  A near sun research ship rather than a desperate mission to restart the sun.  Oh well.  it is worth watching.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is an ok bingo app for kindle...BUT.. customer support is slow to. Non existent.  Also...the layouts are stingy and I find that Bingo Blingo has better games and a much more responsive customer support department...I have played most of the bingo apps available through amazon..this ok me is just ok.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I was sad that Bane wasn't Bane from the comics, but then again Bane in the comics has those stupid tubes  out in the open that could snag or be cut and then no more Bane.  I thought Bane was displayed as dark evil, though the late insertion of the daughter of Ras was questionable, kind of a hmmm, but not as good as it should have been.  the middle sort of fell appart, and how did the little turbine aircraft accellerated fast enough?  it could have been done better, but it's still a very good movie.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|It kept me entertained for 2 hours.  Didn't care for the ending however.  I must say I was impressed with the quality of the movie (HD) even though I was streaming it through wifi
B00ESNE696|5.0|OMG.  Excellent!  A must see episode...  I will watch this episode a few more times as well as share it with friends etc
B0013N3DSE|5.0|The way they treated the storyline and some of the acting reflect the times (1938), but the production is glorious.  We could not believe the color and the clarity.  I remember seeing this one several times as a kid on reruns on TV, but never like this.  Worth the price.  Pull up a chair close to the screen and enjoy.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|You got to get this game now it's not free I cost $1.00 to get . I screamed loud in the car lol.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Love the game and was excited to have it on my kindle.  But it kept freezing up and kicking me out so I had to uninstall it.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|&#34;Cabaret&#34; has been voted the best movie musical ever, and for good reason.  Newcomer Liza IS Sally, and the rest of the<br />cast live in their characters' skin as well.  The story is both intimate and far-reaching, from the mundane to the world-shattering<br />reality of Nazi Germany taking hold.  And it's SO subtle...seeing the Nazi officers through blurry lenses, getting just a whiff of<br />what's to come.  And the sheer decadence of Germany, esp. Berlin, during the early 1930s.  One of my favorite scenes<br />is Joel Grey's character and the &#34;monkey,&#34; so touching and poignant, you can feel him reaching out one last time to an<br />audience that can't even hear him.  Everyone involved was magic, Bob Fosse being most prominent.
0307269752|5.0|I bought this book for a friend off his wishlist of mine but he didn't tell me whether or not he liked it. Soon i'll buy myself a copy
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I liked it, Different take than the original. Would watch it again and recommend to friends and family to watch
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch put out a great, hard rocking album that won't disappoint any of their fans. Killer album and definitely something to blast while driving through a church as you're coming home from partying all night long.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The emotions of this show run so high. I've cried and laughed. Love it so much!!!! I cannot wait to watch more!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Alter Bridge continues to produce great music. This album is a great listen from the first track all the way to the last. Alter Bridge fans will not be disappointed.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great book. I didn't think that it would captivate me, but it did. When reading it i was so immersed in the story than when i wasn't reading i kept thinking about the characters. Overall great read. I would recommend to read it over even if you already have. Definitely a keep.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|All I needed to know is that Vince Gill was signing in this CD and I was buying it. The music is amazing and won't disappoint anyone willing to give this album a chance.
B008200LHW|5.0|I just plugged it in an it worked, can't ask for better than that!.  I use it with &#34;The Capn&#34; navigation software and a 32bit Vista Laptop.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was an exceptional book. The book is well written, endearing and enchanting. You are rooting for characters, perplexed by the drama, drawn in by the unexpected surprises, and feel great when the book finally concludes. It was an excellent purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story kept me reading late into the night. I enjoyed the way the author intersected the lives of the different characters.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was hooked from the 1st page !  Great story that anyone could relate to, thought she did a great job of giving all characters point of views.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent read! Such a good continuation of The Shining! I would recommend this book to any reader who enjoys thrillers!
1569242739|5.0|This cookbook is, hands down, the best dessert cookbook I own.  I'm not a skilled cook otherwise, but when I follow these recipes, everything comes out beautifully.  The chocolate stout cupcakes are my go-to chocolate cupcake.  they are the most moist delicious chocolate cupcakes.  Don't even bother with the basic chocolate cupcake.  If you don't have beer on hand, make another kind of cupcake.  I've probably made more than 70% of the recipes in here (and some over and over again) and I've never baked any cupcakes that weren't highly enjoyed.  Even cupcakes that contain ingredients I dislike, I find to be surprisingly tasty.<br /><br />Favorite recipes:<br />--Chocolate Stout (these are chocolate heaven, I make them with whatever beer I have on hand, most recently a Christmas Spiced Lager)<br />--Green Tea cupcakes (second most used recipe)<br />--Banana Split Cupcakes (these surprised me a lot)<br />--Pistachio Rose water cupcakes (delicate and delicious)<br /><br />The only negative I have about these recipes are the frostings. They make an insane amount of frosting/toppings.  I usually cut the frosting recipes in half and still have left over frosting.  But that's not a big deal to me.  The cupcakes and experience with the recipes more than make up for this small issue.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is lots of fun and interesting puzzels that can be worked in 5-10 minutes.  I would recommend this game to friends.
B000001FYZ|5.0|1st of all I think crazy world is a really good album. The scorpions really haven't put out any bad albums. well, maybe one. I enjoy the albums whether its with Schenker, Roth, or Jabs. The songs on Crazy World are in the same vein as Savage amusement. That's where hard rock was at the time. The Scorpions have always had a mix of hard rockers,ballads and mid-tempo songs and Crazy World is no exception. Its not my fav album by them (that would be Animal Magnetism) but is a good time hard rockin' cd.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This APP is able to detect to links and takes advantage of the features you incorporated in your PDF document.
B00FQAZ7PW|2.0|It's nice to see Pearl Jam is writing but as long as Cameron sits behind their drums they won't be worth listening to.  I don't think he 'feels' the music.  As Eddy says, the music is a wave.  Cameron seems to sink below or crash above each wave instead of riding it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love it because I can put all my books and magazine there, anything that comes I PDF format I can put it there
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  To think it was based on fact made what I was reading even more emotional and amazed that these children survived their experiences.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is the best I love it, I thank JEHOVAH for it😂😃😂😃😂😃😀😀 words cannot describe my true feelings for this app
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It really makes you think as to how you would handle the situation forced on one of the characters.  The ending of the story was very interesting.
B00280LYIM|5.0|These books just keep getting better and better. This book is a must read and will captivate you from page 1. Can't wait to read the next one.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book surprised me as I didn't expect it to grab my attention like it did.  Good love story with a twist.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun game to play. I enjoy playing this game. Helps pass the time.<br />So I give it five stars.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great story!  Very interesting plot development.  It was a hard book to put down at night.  Read it on my Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is my favorite game. Play it all the time. Very challenging and keeps you guessing
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun to play. can think about it or just play mindlessly ...i also like the fact you only have so many lives so you dont lose you
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book inspired me to truly question my potential, my influence, and my level of passion and determination. It answered quite creatively the question of how far can our imagination take us. Sean Patrick does a beautiful job unveiling the life of a genius inventor who would not stop at anything to contribute to the development and advancement of the human race. He poignantly explains to us that imagination and the endless pursuit of knowledge and creativity were the ultimate goals of Tesla, and not so much recognition and fortune. Tesla was in fact the spark and catalyst of so many great inventions, and we can thank, post mortemly, Tesla for his vivid imagination and endless pursuit of the unknown and unattainable despite all of his obstacles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only good thing I can say about this book is that it makes me think that I too could write a best seller.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this to get out of paying shipping and handling on a 24.99 product. This ended up being more useful than the product i was originally buying! I use it for just about every and any kind of knife around. It can also fit on a key chain if you want to keep it with you at all times.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|Stunk big-time it was so lame I'm gladdens been the money buying it I rented it I mean the through Amazon here it played beautifully by it was just the movie was stupid and I thought why did anyone ever make one like that so five after five stars I give you a -0 stars
0316017930|1.0|Really makes a good reading on airport terminal,when the flight is delayed..otherwise this book is shallow in depth and it's contents.Author makes a selective case study..tries come up with a point..which everyone knows before reading the book...!aaargh waste of money
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This movie was worth the 4.99 I pay for rainy and it was so good it was full of action special effects was totally awesome the storyline was really good only thing I didn't like about it my own personal nitpick is the one bag I used bad language about 6 to 7 times it might be less my bill more I think keep count but for a over two hour movie that wasn't too bad but it's the cuss words he was using Aydin like if they used on something else there or cut the cussing out the movie would been perfect so I liked it so much I went out and paid the $20 Fort so rating out of 10 out of 10 it's a  11 and half so I hope you like my review this is only my only opinion of this movie
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|I have seen every season non stop. Season 5 does not dissapoint. It keeps surprising me and keeping me glued to the screen!
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was probably ten years old. I remember I didn't think it was funny.  Probably the very first horror movie I had ever seen I was shocked. Of course that's not to say I didn't like it, it was one of my favorite movies but that doesn't mean it didn't haunt me late at night trying to go to bed. Then of course the BS stories me and my friends making up telling each other about the book of the dead and demons didn't help getting to sleep either.  I have to laugh now, this movie will always hold a special place in my heart lol.
B00DAXYNEI|4.0|It took me watching 3 episodes to get into it. It was Kevin Spacey that made me stick and I am glad I did. The acting is great and the plot keeps evolving in a way that keeps me interested. It has a subtle pace, but is complex at the same time. Great show.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A funny movie made me laugh.  Helps a person wade thru the muck that age brings to us.  Good humor.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller. From the beginning this story has you intrigued as to where he is going, dropping subtle hints and tidying the story up nicely. Simply one of the best novels ever.
0062255657|5.0|As always, Neil Gaiman writes brilliant and interesting stories.  This book was well worth the money and time to read.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|This is one of Joe's best albums....One of the best albums I've heard this year.<br />Not really any facemelting from Joe...but he's never really been one.<br />Lots of smooth playing, groovy jams, melodic songs, and a couple of &#34;out there&#34; songs.  You can tell Mike Kennely has some influence in there :-)<br />You'll see a few songs that remind you of older Satch music and some new.  Go buy it!  Give it 2-3 run throughs and enjoy it :)
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Excellent I want another episode of the Clifton Chronicles. The characters' ives jump off the pages Jeffrey Archer makes you care about them.
B000006YCU|4.0|Some great songs on this album.  Solid tracks on here as well.  Singer's voice is definitely a weak point in the band at that time (he has good moments though).  I just don't like his tone during those high notes.  Ytse Jam, Afterlife, When Dream & Day Unite are my favorites.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Archer is always a good read.  Thoroughly enjoyed this. Looking forward to his next book. As good as Patterson or better.
B00EEXST2K|2.0|In what seems almost quaint -- given today's propensity of porn sites, watch-me cams and utter depravatity -- &#34;Lovelace&#34; is as much a document of porn emerging into the mainstream conversation of the post-sexual revolution/emergence of disco. With the meme that this sort of ugliness can happen to nice girls makes the film play almost as a 50s cautionary tale, yet the exploitation and psychological torment is real.<br />Like Mariel Hemingway in &#34;Star 80,&#34; Amanda Seyfried's Lovelace is a wide-eyed suburban kid whose a bit lost, a bit bored and abit enamored with the wrong kind of guy. In that will to please, she goes down a rabbit of holes of tricks, oral sex and ultimately exploitation by a cabal of sleazy pornographers who take the ultimate selfish pleasure and create a table-turning trope (the girl can actually ONLY climax by giving head)... It was a sensation, and a mainstream sexual icon who literally used sex was born.<br />That is leads to gang rape, beatings and a life of neo-hiding seems hard to imagine in these post-&#34;Girls Gone Wild&#34; days, where pretty co-eds have tattoos and labial piercings, yet the story is not just true -- but still holds, but is even easier to laugh off.<br />Seyfried is translucent as the often confused stand by her man icon... and the flashbacks as the movie unfolds provides depth to what initially seems like 2-dimensional obvious plot turns. Still, the notion is more compelling than the execution -- and Seyfried as the emancipated Lovelace is a disappointment, never feeling empowered or threatened, neither a feminist icon or a fed up victim fighting back.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Good problem solving, and family friendly... my kids and i had fun finding items and puzzling it out. I just wish there were more levels.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|It's a shame that they don't make movies like this any more. Loved the song and dance, and the meandering storyline too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun game. its great for passing time and it keeps me entertained when I have nothing else to do
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr. Sleep is a much needed ending to a tale that began with The Shining and answers the question of what happened to little Danny Torrance. Once again Stephen King has done a superb job with drawing the reader into his story and while entertaining you manages to drop a few insightful pearls of wisdom about human behavior.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This little mic works great. I've used it hooked up to my Canon 5D Mark II for video recording. Audio seems great. Sure it's not a $500 mic, but as cheap as these are, you can't go wrong. Compared to on camera audio, there's no comparison. The cord is very, very long as well. For impromptu interviews, these would work great. Just use a rubber band to keep them secure, throw them in your bag and use that at a moment's notice or for backup.
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|The movie was pretty funny and the story line was good.  I really like the different type of story the did this time.  Not just hangover stuff.  The ending was great!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Product is great, but stopped working after a week of light use. It seems to be a known issue with the hardware and it's possible to exchange it for a new one but I'd expect a better quality out of a hardware like this, it was a very frustrating experience.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I truly enjoy it, you have so many options. You can keep in contact with family and friends all over the world. And I also enjoy playing their games
B000KX0HVY|5.0|I bought this for my 91 year old mother and it is so wonderful I'm buying it for myself.  Beautiful sound best Elvis ever.
0440237688|4.0|The giver is about an eleven year old boy named jonah and he lives in a place called the community. The community is a near perfect place where there is no crimes, problems or deaths. The people in the community don't even know what death is. Since there isn't any health issues to worry about within the community hen a person reaches 65 years old they are released out of the community. People believe that the elderly are sent to a paradise island where they will spend eternity in. In actuality there is something much darker going on.<br /><br />The community works in a very orderly fashion. When you turn a certain age you get things to represent your maturity. Each year people in the same age group gets a the same thing. or example when you turn nine you get a bike to symbolize your independence and not having to rely on your parents to take you everywhere. Or when you turn five and you get a jacket with buttons that symbolizes your ability to get dressed by yourself. The main character jonah is going to turn twelve in a couple of months at the start of the book. When you turn twelve you are appointed a role in the community.The elders get to appoint each child a job based on personality and physical or mental strength<br /><br /> The day jonah has been waiting for is very close by. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes mysteries. At some parts it does get boring because the author does tend to over explain things that have already been stated earlier in the book, but there is a lot of high points in the book that really overshadows the bad stuff in the book. The conclusion was very straight to the point without any cliffhangers and the character really matures throughout the book. He gains wisdom and the power to change everybodys way of thinking.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|I really love Ellie's unique voice. It stands out among all the other voices on the radio. I definitely know when it's her without even hearing the name of who is singing. This song &#34;Burn&#34; is very catchy and great to work out to also!
1250038820|5.0|Can you ever go wrong with HONY? Every day inspiration in the form of moving photographs. Great gift. I bought several to hand out at Christmas.
B004TI5N38|4.0|It was fast moving and engaging...............the characters were interesting and the plot did have some good twists which were a surprise
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love LOVE this book!! I got hooked within the first chapter and had a hard time putting it down. Would recommend to anyone!
3551354014|5.0|It's just what you can expect from a paperback, not better or worse than any other. It will likely fall apart if you read it over and over but seeing as how I would expect that it doesn't lower my rating.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app!!!! If i want to know what the day holds weatherwise i just touch tbis little app and find out!!! Plus this makes it easier to plan events and i can wear the proper attire for that dsy!!!! Love it!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Very challenging.  Love the fact that it has so many levels.  I can play this game all day if I had the time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very fun game. Wish you didn't have to use diamonds to buy things though. Very addictive but I enjoy playing it
0385523394|1.0|Orange is the New Black.<br />  Saw her on the Katie show & decided to purchase, but It didn't hold my interest at all !!!

B0022Q8CSC|5.0|If you're a fan of the movies, this is a must read for all. The detail and description of all characters and events are phenomenal.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Fun and very affordable to play, a little challenging at first and gets a lot harder in the long run

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Told by a series of entertaining anecdotes collected from interviews with Steve Jobs himself, this book details the life of an individual who sought to revolutionize the tech industry with his principles of \\"thinking different,\\" and was successful in doing so. Every aspect of his life, from his early years in grade school to his battles with cancer, is covered in great detail. And by interviewing hundreds of other people close to Jobs who witnessed his journey, Isaacson makes sure that nothing is left out in his retelling. Isascon also tells the story in a easy-to-understand, logical way that requires little no background about the subject.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was born into a troubled family who quickly gave him up for adoption. After he was accepted by his new family, an interest for electronics was kindled in him by his father. He soon met Steve Wozniak, and their similar interests sparked a lifelong friendship. They became partners manufacturing the Apple I computer in his garage, and thus Apple was born. Throughout his career, he would focus on presentation much more heavily than what was thought to be wise, and this made Apple products the most appealing available. After a brief leave to attempt to pursue his own company, Jobs returned to Apple, where he would stay and develop the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to hear the story of an average man with above-average ideas making a dent in the world will not be disappointed by this book.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It does exactly as advertised at a fraction of the cost.  Since I'm an avid Netflix subscriber, this works great.  However, Google has still not released many apps in support of the player.  I'm sure it's coming, it just hasn't yet.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super fun I luv it and I finished all of the levels so I am doing them again. I absolutely love this game. My tip for you is to save your hints for the bigger levels, they are more needed then.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|MaddAddam, the third book in the trilogy after &#34;Oryx and Crake&#34; and  &#34;The  Year of the Flood&#34; completes Margaret Atwood's distressing, yet fascinating look at a future where corporate power and genetic mutation become the standard for existence.  I didn't start the series until MaddAddam was published, but have read the three books within a six week period.  Being able to go from book one to two and then to the final novel was far more satisfying than waiting the ten years that it took Ms. Atwood to complete all three books.
B00498SDN0|4.0|Awesome.  Kids loved it, but lacks the original charm.  Will always be a classic.  I recommend that everyone should watch the whole series.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My sister and I are Boomers who enjoy British humor. I purchased this DVD for a visit to her house so we could enjoy watching it several times to &#34;catch&#34; all of the subtle words and phrases. The stars are first rate, the story is wonderful, and the locations are colorful and portrayed in a positive light. Loved it.
0143124544|5.0|I am not usually a fan of love stories but this novel caught my heart and soul....At one point tears rolled down my cheeks yet there was such touching warmth to these characters.  Simply put I loved it and have picked it as our book club read this month...I had read another Jojo Moyes novel last year and I also enjoyed that book but this one far surpassed the  others.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story started out slow for me but turned out to be a page turner (or button-presser on my Kindle).

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought this for my mom's Kindle Fire HD and at first it was a little stiff and not wanting to stay in the upright position. After a little wear and breaking in it was good to go. If you have a kindle fire I would recommend getting this case.

B004VMEILU|5.0|This book was an awesome gift for my hubby b/c he loves Bruce Lee. This book came to us in great condition and pretty quick !
B00CHVJI08|5.0|I loved this movie when I went to see it with my kids, they did too, and the feeling has remained even after repeated viewings. The toy was a hit with my daughter too. Never been a really big fan of Nick Cage, although he gets into some really interesting films. However, his delivery in this film is really something. A strong and moving film that imagines a scenario from which can be implied emerged the origins of modern humans. In this sense, there is also a sense of nostalgia and positivism as well as an implicit foreboding about the film. Recommended.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|The cd was great HOWEVER, i didnt see were this was the clean copy of the cd so i was NOT happy. I NEVER buy clean/edited cd's i always like the real version.  :(
0307743659|4.0|It's been about 25 years since I first read The Shining. It was one of the first books by King that I read and it's one of the main reasons why I believe he's the greatest authors ever. I don't usually reread books, even his, but before reading the sequel that came out last month, I wanted to have the true story fresh in my mind, and not have my memory of it muddied by the story that Stanley Kubrick told with his movie.<br /><br /> Reading the book again was like returning to the home I grew up in after having been away for a couple of years. As soon as I got there, my mind was immediately flooded with many fond memories. This time though, the memories were of five-year-old Danny Torrance, and his parents Jack and Wendy. They were of Dick Hallorann, the Outlook's chef who share's Danny's gift for shining and senses the dangers that the Torrances could face during their months of seclusion high in the Colorado Rockies. But the fondest memories to come flooding back were of the animal-shaped topiaries down by the Outlook's playground, and of the roque mallet, Lloyd the Outlook's bartender, Tony, and of course . . . REDRUM.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|More than anything this reminded me of the way way back. Great acting all around. Even Kristen Stewart gets out of her usual lethargy.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Loads of fun! Very entertaining and gets your brain going trying to puzzle out the best way to get a little snack for our vampire buddy!
B0058UXHHK|3.0|sweet read but nothing to write home about. A little mystery and a loveable mutt.  First time romances are always memorable and so are nosie neighbors.
B002KKCVR8|4.0|This is my second pair of Teva's. I found the toe strap fits differently on these. The biggest problem is the attachment on the middle strap. It is tight and I am afraid the Velcro will loosen/break with repeated use. They are lighter than the previous sandals and very comfortable otherwise.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Already a great product! I can't wait to are it progress into a five star product (I am confident it will be there soon!)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you like Grisham, this is a good book. Lots of twists and turns as well as great, interesting characters.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|They tried too hard. Great book, not a great movie. Didn't like the modern music in a film about the 20's.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|they took a wile getting it for the kindle but it was worth the waite! I loved playing candy crush on my phone and computer. It is even better playing it on my kindle .. I have the best of my laptop and phone in one place.

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|It is amazing what a girl so young has not only experienced but can write so intelligently about. An inspiring read
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is magnificent.  I purchased it a very few days ago and wanted to read it right away.  I am a great admirer of Mr. Grisham and I can go back to the very beginning of his courtroom sagas.  I liked him from the start and basically was buying every single book that he published, but soon starting losing interest in his books.  They simply did not seem as interesting as the first few he wrote.  I read The Firm and saw the movie, both of which I loved - then I  read A Time to Kill and also saw the movie.  This last book did it for me!  I was hooked, loved the stories and wanted to continue reading Mr. Grisham.  Then I read The Client, The Pelican Brief, the Runaway Jury - and then I stopped.  Over the last few years I have added to my collection other books of John Grisham and started a couple of them, but have not been able to get interested in them.  Somewhere, somehow, the original John Grisham was gone and with the excitement and interest that a great book holds on you.  I've had a Kindle for 3 years now and I don't buy books anymore that I can't donwload to my Kindle an my computer.  I do spend a lot of time reading (I have the time) and I download many more books that it seems possible to read.  At last count, I believe I have about 537, or so, and, my taste is eclectic, so I have various books on many different topics and typically I read 2 or 3 books at once.  I like to do this.  When I get tired of one subject, I start reading another book with a different subject and I then keep going back to the books I am reading, until I finish them.  I go back to old classics that I haven't read since HIgh School and college, or I read the latest scientific information on some particular subject.  I am a history buff and read a lot of history and biography books' I love medical thrillers; I love Baldacci, Grisham, Patterson, Cornwell, Connelly, Patterson, - and my favorite, Ken McClure.  I am equally adept at reading in either Spanish or English and I spend a lot of time reading books in Spanish as well.  Anyhow, Mr. Grisham just hit the top of the ladder with Sycamore Row.  I loved it!  A great, entertaining story.  Loved to go back to the old courthouse and reading about Jake Brigance.  What a treat!  Kudos!  Congratulations!  I have visions of Mathew McConaughey in his old role in the new movie of Sycamore Row.  Keep 'em coming!of time reading books in Spanish as well.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|The writing is top notch as normal. However I'm vested in my favorite characters from the first three novels and this book is a whole new cast of characters that I just couldn't get into. Hope book 5 brings them back to finish off the loose ends.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Anybody who grew up in a small town is acutely aware of the gossip, whether good or bad.  Rose is delightful and an underdog, but she makes some new changes.  Funny, sad, a mystery set in the south, who could ask for more?
B00G32OER4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. There were no gimmicks, so it made things a lot more realistic. A true classic horror movie.
006202406X|1.0|I loved Divergent.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.  HOWEVER this book was a huge disappointment.  Many many other reviewers have said it much more eloquently than I so I wont belabor the point but nothing about this book was satisfying or had the same appeal as the other two. From the muddled and often confusing interchange of pov to the pointless deaths, I ended this book just feeling angry and questioning whether I should have ever read the trilogy to begin with.  I honestly questioned whether this book was even written by the same author.<br /><br />I understand that an author has to let the story be what it is and follow the vision as they see it, but let's be honest, a majority of us read YA FOR THE HAPPILY EVER AFTER!  I appreciate sacrifice and bravery when it is part of something real, something that reminds us what it means to be human and a better version of ourself (see the ending of the first book in the Delirium trilogy for a perfect example of what I mean) but this was nothing more than shock value in its lowest form.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is a great accountability partner. Reminders are so useful studying the Bible plans. The best feature is audio option.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I enjoyed this movie at the theater and am thrilled that I could get it on my Kindle! Good price too.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wish this version had a little more to it. There are no monsters and it seems you can't mine certain elements. I am a little disappointed.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|I do daycare and one day we lost our electricity so the TV didn't work.  I downloaded a couple of movies so the kids could still watch a movie at rest time.  They enjoyed this movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A wonderful story that stretches across time and the world.  Today's world in all its complexities.  A must read truly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It wad wonderful to see our old friends from the Shining and the Overlook Hotel once again.  Great job taking us back and bringing us forward again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Enjoyed this bookup to about 2/3 way through...then I was completely captivated. Completely moved! Change my outlook on several issues.
B0000TB03W|3.0|The quality of the recording was awful, I couldn't believe it. I have another of her concerts from several years ago that is the same exact concert but the cover was entirely different from the one I bought in the past and has the same exact songs on it right down to what she was wearing.<br />You should check it out. I know Shania Twain would be horrified.  And I was so disappointed too.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Great movie! Just as good as the first. So refreshing to see a kid's movie that is actually entertaining for all.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|So far I like it - it is fun and poppy! Katy Perry's albums never disappoint me - sometimes it takes me a few listens to like some of the songs, but like I said they never disappoint.
0896760839|5.0|This book is very descriptive and full of pictures.  I like that I can look for a piece and see it.  This book met my needs because I have a visual interest and there are helpful notes to go with the diagrams.  For someone who wishes to sew this was a very good book.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I loved this book. Although the topic was definitely sad I thought the author did a great job not getting too far into the dramatics. The characters were loveable and the plot was funny (albeit far-fetched) - I would highly recommend this book!

B007SGLZP8|2.0|No where near the depth and reality I've come to expect froma John Grisham book. I found the premise to be highly implausible. He admits in his end notes that he did not do the research that he usually does. This has the feel of being a &#34;contract&#34;, i.e.one that was done to fulfill a contract obligation
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|as I live in the uk this is the must  have version  the uk edition is cut  all of the us edition bonus feature,s are missing  the 3d looks great on my lg 47&#34; tv  .
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's a useful product. It's been more than a month I've been using it. But initially, the set up was very hectic as the chromecast was not detected by my new Samsung LED TV. I had to reset it a lot and finally it got set up. So I haven't touched it or taken out ever since.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|This is a fairly unremarkable plot with somewhat stock characters but nevertheless, the movie is very watchable. I think perhaps this is because despite the story and characters not being novel, the acting is phenomenal and story mostly plausible. The male lead, Tom Courtenay, was in Dr Zhivago as the young poet revolutionary Pasha. We recently rewatched Dr. Zhivago on the big screen and I was impressed with the actor and once again, he does a fantastic job with this role. Trivia: This is the 2nd time Maggie Smith has been in a movie named \\"Quartet\\". Long career or not, how often does that happen?
B00338QENI|3.0|The story of HeLa cells is important both from a scientific and an ethical perspective, however, Ms. Skloot places an undue emphasis on the hostility of the Lacks' family toward the researchers.  Informed consent was not and still is not required to conduct scientific research on human cells (as in the manner involving Henrietta Lacks), and Skloot does not thoroughly present the issues both for and against this practice.  Instead, the many unfortunate events of the Lacks' family are somehow presented as being attributable to being taken advantage of by the scientific establishment.  Skloot never corrects the family's misunderstandings about what the scientists were doing--Henrietta was not sacrificed, she was not being cloned, Johns Hopkins is not a billion dollar corporation, and the scientists were not personally profiting.  Skloot clearly developed a deep relationship with Henrietta's daughter Deborah, and shares some moving examples of the profound loss she suffered, but there just was not enough to support her conclusion that something needs to be made right with the family.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Interesting assortment of data from the summer of 1927. Emphasis on aviation and Charles Lindbergh sometimes a bit too much. But other stories on Babe Ruth etc. author did a great job helping to understand the attitudes, ethics and priorities of America that summer.
B001CTGQBK|1.0|Tounge-in-cheek review... sort of. The tragic tale of a sweet, young woman who is lead astray by the miscreants at her new school, ultimately turning into a bit of a tart. Until starting at her new school, Sandy was the sort of woman you'd be proud to introduce to your parents. However, after meeting some of the other students, including the morally corrupt \\"Pink Ladies\\", she is transformed into a more debased version of femininity. Some of her new behaviours include smoking, hanging out with hoons, and (cringe) singing in public. Realistically Grease 2 should have been about Sandy's future, not about motorcyclists.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting and challenging. Although it can be frustrating and certain levels seem impossible to overcome, I've found that by perservering I eventually triumph. At first I was annoyed by the 5-life and time limits but I've come to appreciate that they keep me from becoming too addicted. I've managed to complete all the levels through 168 thus far without spending any $$ or asking for help from friends.
0316204366|5.0|A classic Malcolm Gladwell book: impactful thesis supported with interesting anecdotes. Gladwell suggests that attributes generally thought of as advantages aren't always so, and disadvantages are similarly misconceptualized. In classic Gladwell fashion, he crafts engaging narratives to support the overall argument to keep the reader engaged. Highly recommend.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have read this over a year ago already, and I have since been waiting -- with undimmed eagerness, with long-suffering patience -- for Book Two!!!  Anthony Ryan, why are you withholding your genius thusly??!!<br /><br />I won't give a synopsis or even a short description of what Blood Song is about.  Many of the reviews have already done that.  All I want to add here is to sing my own praise for this wonderful read.  The five-star rating is WELL-DESERVED.  When I first came to know about Blood Song there must have been, oh, maybe 700 or so reviews on it already, almost all of them 5-stars or 4-and-a-half stars.  I thought, \\"well, if these many people really liked this book, I'd go check it out myself.\\"  Here we are, year 2013, with OVER A THOUSAND REVIEWS so far, and the book is solid 5-stars.  Totally, totally well-deserved.  I hunger for more of Anthony Ryan's writing (of this genre, anyways), but there is only...silence, for now.  Aaargggh!!<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Ha!  The \\"Tower Lord\\" is coming in 2014!!  DarkBlade looms once more in the horizon.  Yes!!
B001OST0LW|1.0|and that's sad that I can't give it more than one star, and no time has not been kind to this movie. Warner Bros. made the mistake to let Tim Burton go because his Batman movie were too dark, I guess they never read a Batman Comic Book. And Micheal Keaton didn't want to come back if Burton wasn't there, and also because he wanted to do a Batman Begins type of story and Joel schumacker decided to do a Batman 60's t.v. show esq movie. Enter Val Kilmer, his Bruce Wayne is well he's just there. I've said before, we dealt with the whole getting over his parents death in the first movie, but here, it's shoved down our throats. We get flashback, after flashback of a giant bat. And Bruce at his parents funeral, it gets over done. And there's really only two scenes of Bruce out in public, the circus scene and the scene to introduce Jim Carrey's character. Kilmer's Batman, well he's modeled after Adam West's Batman. Just updated for the 90's, I'm not even going to talk about the nipples on the bat suit, his Batman, much like his Bruce Wayne is just there. Chris O'donell gets cast as Dick Grayson, and all he does is whine his way through this movie. From stealing the batmobile, and trying to rescue a girl. Which sad to say wasn't that bad of a scene, to Bruce having to rescue him.  And then in the next scene, Dick has to rescue him. Nicole Kidman is cast as a love interest, along with drew barrymore. Yeah just go with it, and Kidman's character at first really loves Batman, has a crush on him. Then she falls in love with Bruce Wayne, which just like Dark Knight rises. Leads to one of the most unBatman moments, where Bruce is going through the Batcave with Dick, turning everything off. Saying he's given up crimefighting, because now he's found true happiness. Something Batman would never do, just like in Dark knight when  to run away, and in Dark Knight rises when he retired. Again, something Batman would never do. Now Tommy Lee Jones playes two-face, annnnnnnd. Yeah, it's painful to watch. He laughs the whole time, a was a knock-off of the joker. Jim Carrey as The Riddler, that actually had potentional. But alas, his motivation is to best Bruce Wayne. A disgruntled employee, not the riddler. The one cool scene in the movie, is when Two-Face, and The Riddler break into Wayne Manor, knock-out Bruce. Kidnap Dr. Meridan, The Riddler breaks into the Batcave. And blows it up, along with the Batmobile, which reminds me. If your trying to be stealthy, and strike fear in the hearts of criminals, why on earth would you build a vehicle that has slits in the sides. And a bright light shining out of them, give me the 89' Batmobile anyday. It's the best one period, and that includes the tumbler. So Bruce recovers, finds a new Batsuit that hadn't been destroyed, along with Robin. He goes off, and defeats the villains. This movie is Batman on acid, you wants to know what the 60's t.v. show would look like today. This movie is your answer, it goes nowhere, and it tries so hard. But, the Dr. Meridan Character is never developed. Two-Face's back story is actually shown on a T.v screen in about 5 min, Robin's parents deaths are blamed on Two-Face. He goes around doing....... nothing but Causing damage. Cause \\"I must kill The Bat\\", a line from the movie. The Riddler, well again. He's just a disgruntled employee, who wants to make more than his boss. Nothing scary here, a poor excuse for a Batman Movie.
159448385X|5.0|I loved this novel. By far the best Hosseini novel in my opinion. Hits right in the gut....couldn't stop thinking about this novel for days.<br /><br />I sat here and tried to think of negative comments and I frankly, couldn't. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.  I will say though, it is GRAPHIC. And not for the faint of heart.  I would not recommend this book to young teens or children, but for adults, it's truly a work of art.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The thrilling second book in th  hunger games series. What happens next to the star crossed lovers from District 12? Will Katniss choose Gale or Peeta? And how will President Snow get his revenge?
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is awesome. I was reading up on all the positive reviews by others and they weren't wrong! I love Persona. Going to get deep into this game for hours! There's so much content.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|After reading this book, I feel inspired to do something with my life. To strive to be the best man I can be and to help others as was shown in this book. Just an outstanding story everyone should know about. What a great man to inspire to be like. An example for all of us to follow.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I wasn't too sure when I first downloaded but so far I'm enjoying the game.  Unlike other apps, where after a couple levels, you have pay for the remaining levels, I have yet had to pay to play.  Looking forward to many more hours of playing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Awesome and addictive, easy to play.<br />Great for all ages. Graphics are brilliant and the little animations are cute as well.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved this book. It gave me an insight into to why my mate and I react to each other the way we do. This book is a key that opens a whole new world to having a wonderful loving satisfing life with your mate.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love it. It is amazing. I am addicted to it. My daughter even loves playing it. I w ish that it was easier to get more diamonds.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Ok the game is awesome but I'm having an issue I can't get into the game to contact customer support but I'm having a launching game problem it keeps closing out the game right after it loads if support reads this I hope they do and be able to help me or fix the problem for the kindle fire hd  other than that this game is awesome I just don't want to have to uninstall to fix it and all my game play is gone it just started happening immediately after I hit lvl 20
B001DSNFVO|5.0|great quality and great record. Some of the best classic rock songs of all time. I would definitely recommend it
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is very calming  it will get u to sleep get the kids sound to sleep and you could relax too with this app you should try it you would truly satisfied
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|So I ordered it on Saturday and I received it on monday thats amazing, just 2 days well anyways this figure is freakin awesome I thought it was gonna be a bit bigger but overall its a nice size and the detail is just so amazing, well what can I say i'm in love, this is by far the best dbz figure I have owned
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I have always enjoyed most rpg games, the graphics are decent and the interface is ok. With a few more patches this could be bad=#/!
B00AC8ZA3M|1.0|This movies' characters did not resolve any issues. Action was predictable and lame. None of the characters was likable. Writing was boilerplate
B0067QPVD2|5.0|Pretty good flick, Killer Special Effects, Good Acting, Overall I liked it really well. I thought it was going to a remake of the remake with Kurt Russel but it actually turned out to be a different story(Tied in with the old movie) which I like a lot as well. Check it out, you should like it if you liked the thing with Kurt Russel :)
0316204366|3.0|I was expecting much more from this book. It started with a great analysis of the David & Goliath battle followed by useful chapters on ideal classroom size, how the Impressionists were able to succeed, what happens when choosing a top tier university ( a must read for high school seniors and their parents), and how dyslexia could help somebody in the long run. But then the book turn into a history lesson and analysis of American civil rights movements,  Northern Ireland struggles, and World War II events that, even though were interesting, they did not match the first third of the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the &#34;cleaness&#34; of the whole series.  Very watchable without the discomfort of seeing &#34;skin&#34; on TV.  The plots kept me coming back for more.  I can't wait for Season 4. I can't stand the character Mary and I don't understand why Matthew loves her.  I look forward to seeing how her character changes now that he is gone and she's now a mother or if it even will.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got to level 400 and loved it.  I can't wait to pass more levels. What level are you<br />Fellas on?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The app is very well designed and makes the IPAD a better tool.  The price was fine and download was very simple.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Good action movie for Trekkies but plot twists answered by the alternate timeline that must upset many of them. The young Capt. Kirk is too predictable and should learn that tact and guile sometimes work better than fighting.  I don't expect every film made to be a Classic so this one is enjoyable and entertaining and is well worth the money spent to see it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is awesome there are a few issues , it freezes sometimes and the ads get in the way  of setting the alarm
B005HE5J7I|4.0|Long but interesting  The sheer span of time covered and the subjects intervowen are mind blowing<br />Not a summer read but a great history
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited that I was finally able to get this app for the kindle. I love this game.
0440246008|5.0|I only discovered Lee Child and Jack Reacher a few months ago - and I've now read every one of the books. I only wish I'd spot a new one!<br /><br />Jack Reacher is the kind of man every woman would like to take home and keep - or maybe not. He's a wandering soul who probably wouldn't do well in captivity.<br /><br />In The Hard Way Reacher gets pulled into a drama believing that he's helping to rescue a kidnap victim - but soon the plot changes and he learns the truth. Lee Child keeps us on the edge of the seat, hoping that Reacher will be able to get there in time to save lives and put the bad guys out of commission for good.<br /><br />Don't start this one at bedtime - you'll be awake all night turning the next page.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Does not live up to the 2 books before.  Slow, and hate to say it...boring.  Totally recommend the 1st and 2nd book.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Ready to blow your mind? Watch this and you'll LOVE walking on a sidewalk! Phillips is really a bird with legs!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun but so addicting I hate it when I run out of lives.  I recommend this game.
B001BR7CZW|4.0|Totally over the top but great talent and music. Good venue for some wonderful musicians. Old movie that brought back memories.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best :&#34;soap opera&#34; ever. I love watching the original UK version. The only down side is giving up three days to watrch them back to back LOL
B003WH765U|5.0|this is absolutely one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  I was so excited when I found it on amazon to buy.  Even with all the prejudice that we have seen throughout the centuries in this world one thing that will never change is the fact that love has no boundaries.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game just hated the fact it took months to get it on kindle fire stupid that I could go to my Facebook page but couldn't play it from there!!
B00005O3VD|5.0|I have never cared for Barbra Streisands music but I saw this movie when it first came out to the theater when I was a young girl and I thought it was a great movie and I am really glad I bought it.  It is very entertaining.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh my, this book. It breaks your heart and feels so real. I work with the sick and dying. It was refreshing to read about someone real, someone who wasn't just trying to fight and smile. I just loved it.
B00F91H15W|3.0|Interesting story, but didn't hold me interest. It just seemed to jump around a lot, and there was no one to root for, as all the characters are pretty awful people. I guess that was the point though.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like this downloader the best. It is easy and works well. I searched through countless apps to find it. I tried several and found this to be my favorite one.
B00FXRTWQ8|5.0|This game is very addictive!  The fish are cute, and the aquarium is fun to decorate.  Two games in one!
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|I like this star map best. I searched through a lot to find it. Also it does not require being online.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Jake is a hero Harry  Rex a cool dude and Lucien still drunk. Love Ford County stuff. Thank goodness I don't live there!!<br /><br />Jake is a hero Harry<br /><br />,<br />Jake's a hero, Harry Rex a cool dude and Lucien still drunk .  Thank goodness I didn't live in Ford County
B006FE83UE|5.0|Gregory Pec. !!!  Can entertainment get better than watching Gregory Peck.  The story is timeless and at the time it was made<br />a huge surprise I am sure but it is another Classic every home should have.  Haprer Lee wrote a wonderful story
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. Very well written, and realistic. There are many storylines through to follow. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I heard a few tidbits on NPR and didnt think it was as good as other albums, but now I've listented to the whole thing and it ROCKS!!! It reminds me of Depeche, the Smiths, the Cure and others combined.  Makes me happy and want to dance.  Each song gets better and better.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves Ninjango and he was so excited to see this!! He loves that it comes with pieces and not just the book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is such a fun game.  Not as challenging as Dragon Gem but very enjoyable. I can share this with the grandchildren.  ITreeGamer goes a good job!
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|It's a funny game and her levels has big amounts of creativity, 100% recommended. Goog job for Mediocre developers, congratulations.
0744014956|4.0|I really liked this guide. I has everything you need to know about this game. I did, however, expect a little more. I thought this book had an online guide, but it didn't. This guide is strictly for story mode. Oh and one more thing, I found a small mistake in the stunt jump location #50. It turns out that the location on the map is located half a centemeter to the right of its actual location. It may sound like a little, but that mistake costed me about 40 minutes of my time, so if you ever buy this guide and decide to go for those jumps, remember to move the dot half a centemeter to the left on jump #50. cheers and good luck!!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Very interesting and readable.  This account of an important time in our history contains many facts I was not aware of.  After reading this, I'll never think of the events of that ear in the same way.  A page turner.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|First off- do not read and rely on one of the various hipster reviews that bash this film because of drawn out comparisons to an original Asian version made years ago.  If you read each and every one of those 1 star reviews, you will easily find 8 out of 10 complain that it is a \\"ripoff\\".  Just take this movie for what it is:  A remake of another movie.  Don't be close-minded and think this is going to be a shot-by-shot remake.<br /><br />The movie upon its opening starts pulling you in with layered characters, all of which lie or deceive each other in various ways.  From there the movie just flows.  You spend the movie growing and learning to like each character or hate each character for their own reasons.  By the time the movie begins to approach its climax, you believe you see where it's going when suddenly- bam!  The ending takes a twist that few stories would never dare to take.  From the acting of DiCaprio (whom I actually despised prior to watching this gem) to Nicholson to Damon and Wahlberg, all the roles are perfectly cast and acted out from beginning to end.<br /><br />Buy it.  Don't even think about it.  Unless you're one of those who saw the original \\"Internal Affairs\\" and is afraid to admit that something new is as equally brilliant to the old in its own ways.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|This album is very catch. It is easy to listen to and is better than I expected it to be.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|Wittiest show on TV.  I've enjoyed MF since it came out a few years ago. Its as good now as it was when it first aired.
B006XF5BTG|2.0|Solid evidence to support compound exercise build muscle but Isolation exercises do have a place in training. Doing a workout on a given machine does give the ability build a specific muscle group. Having a balance in muscle is key to good overall performance. The book was a great read but does not deserve 5 stars.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun ,addictive puzzle game.<br />Great graphics, no glitches, easy to learn, easy interface. The game provides ample hints should you get stuck.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great conclusion to the trilogy. Less action than The Dark Knight, but it was a strong movie. Blue ray is the way to go.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I thought at first I would not really like this book. But as I read more it became much more interesting. I would recommend reading it to everyone because it teaches a lot about how to try and do self evaluations.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|n 1958, seven kids took it upon themselves to rid the town of Derry of a child killer that took the form of a killer clown. In 1985, the clown is back and the kids return to Derry to finish what they started...<br /><br />Yeah, I'm a couple decades late to the party on this one. So what? Some friends were doing a group read and I decided it was time to tackle this kitten squisher.<br /><br />While it's a horror story, it's also about growing up and forgetting what it's like to be a kid. Stephen King does a great job at reminding me what it was like to hear noises in the night and fearing some monster is coming for you. In fact, It is the third Stephen King novel I've dreamed about while reading it, right up there with The Tommyknockers and the Dark Tower.<br /><br />The characters play well off each other and feel very real. It was all too easy to imagine playing in the barrens with the Losers or running from Henry Bowers and his gang.<br /><br />Having seen the mediocre TV miniseries from 1990, I was surprised by everything that was lost in translation. Lots more Pennywise in this, for one thing, and there was a lot more to the ending. As I've said in other reviews, even though I knew how things were going to turn out, King still had me on edge during some of the tense moments.<br /><br />In some ways, It felt like a trial run of some concepts that found their way into the Dark Tower. The kids were definitely a Ka-Tet and felt Gunslingerish. Also, the Turtle of amazing girth upon whose shell he holds the earth.<br /><br />My only gripe with the book was that I felt like it could have lost about 20% of the length and not lost a whole lot of story. There was a lot of extraneous info. While some of it fleshed out Derry and made it feel real, some of it felt like no one had the guts to tell Sai King to cut it. In short, some places felt as bloated as a phone book left out in the rain. Was this the book where Stephen King went from &#34;Stephen King, very successful author&#34; to &#34;Stephen King, no editor shall dare command me!&#34;?hor&#34; to &#34;Stephen King, no editor shall dare command me!&#34;?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Although I'm not a big fan of the minions, but this game is fun! it is great on the kindle fire. (:
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Maybe I just keep comparing this to the 1974 version -- and keep wondering, \\"why?\\" Why was this remade? While I like Leo, there is no nuance, look, mannerism or charm he could insinuate that would make it a worthwhile picture. His use of the term, \\"old sport\\" which is used throughout the film, is forced -- unbelieveable to his portrayal of Gatsby. If anything about the character should come smoothly, it's that term. The real story should be in-depth character studies -- in this film, the only story is showing off how far they can push computers. For all the computer-generated spectacle of backdrop and set design, this may as well have been an animated movie. Also, a soundtrack in keeping with the time period would have been a lot less distracting. Can't believe I will never get those 2 hours of my life back.
B0091XEW9M|5.0|This movie is the best movie I have ever watched, and ever will watch. It has romance, passion, political relevance, meaning, essentially everything you could want in a movie.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|Chloe Thurlow is the master of erotica, or should I say mistress? This is the second book I have read by this author and she is adept at mixing an engaging plot with erotica which is not repetitive or dull by any means.<br /><br />This story of a girl who decides to take a swim in the nude whilst on holiday, draws the reader in as she experiences a whole world of sex and punishment which she never knew existed. The writer creates a vivid picture as Chengi experiences thrills and adventure of which she couldn't ever have dreamed were possible.<br /><br />Falling in love with a sheik and becoming part of his harem, Chengi is introduced to a foreign and mysterious world in which a woman is subservient and kept for one purpose. She discovers new joys for her body as she becomes a willing sex slave, sold as a slab of meat for male gratification.<br /><br />Yet this is not a novel which subverts the female. It enriches the female experience and opens up new avenues of pleasure in a world only dreamt about by so many.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun. Very addicting!  I finally gave into the craze and don't regret it.  Love that there is no time limit if I have an interruption. Ie. Kids.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  It I so much fun. My whole family plays it. I look forward to other game  this developer has  made.  I am hooked on it
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this season and I bought the second season and I am looking into buying the third season. Now that I am caught up I can watch the fourth season and know what happen to the characters.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Looking for other games that are not there. Also music does not fit game I dont need a big music production while I pick my retro game to play
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I got hooked on this show from my roommate on campus. I thought this show was dumb but then I started watching it from season three. Then I got hooked and had to find out what happened at the beginning so I bought the first and now I have the second season. I am going to end up buying the third season pretty soon. I did notice that the second season is longer than the first season so you will get four discs. The fourth disc in this season is like a special feature disc or something. Not sure because I didn't watch it.
B004JMY312|5.0|A must have to anyone's Halloween flick collection.  I like it as much as the grandkids.  Wholesome, whimsical fun for the holiday.  The Divine Miss M, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy rock as the Sanderson Sisters.
B008220BLG|3.0|This movie didn't make a lot of sense, it was alright, but not what I was expecting it to be.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|The grandkids hadn't seen this classic and our old, VHS copy is fragile so we purchased this one and introduced yet another generation to E.T. and Elliott.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|This was a nice little movie for a good price, especially a Blu-ray.  The Blu-ray quality really shines through and the special features are great.  As for the movie itself, very cute for kids.  It's not SO much one of those that great for adults, too (like the Incredibles, Megamind, or Cloudy w/ a Chance of Meatballs), but still very cute.  A good buy to add to your kid collection.
