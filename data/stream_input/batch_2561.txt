B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed the story, though many have had misgivings. I didn't think Sookie and Eric were meant for each other. Too many obstacle were standing in their way. Eric is too embroiled in vampire affairs, and Sookie has no desire to be a vampire. How was it going to work? Was Eric going to turn her against her will? How would that build their relationship? It just didn't make sense for them to be together. Just because they were great in bed and such, doesn't mean they were great as a couple. Eric has no say over his life. Sookie would always come second, and no woman wants to be second.<br /><br />As for me, I felt the series ending on the only note it could have. Sookie enjoys being human turning her would have destroyed the Sookie we loved.

B00AK57N00|2.0|This game is a little boring for my opinion. It will be wonderful game in 1986. But in 2013 this app looks a little bit strange.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Usually, I can figure out the ending, but not in this one!  Read it because of recent articles about the book and author.  It was published years ago, but is making a comeback.  It was hard to put the book down!  Hope you enjoy it!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This isgreat.Quick, simple and easy to use. I have this on my samsung tablet. The  small icon can live on the opening page and be very unobtrusive.. highest 5 star recommendation
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|As with any  Denzel movie this was a good one.  Would have liked a bit more action and John Goodman and I would have given it 5 stars.
0805047905|5.0|My 8 month old daughter LOVES this book! I love that she'll pick it out of a stack of other books to read (... or chew on while mommy tries to read...). All I have to say is &#34;Ava, Ava, What do you see?&#34; and she grins. LOVE it and definitely recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was captivated from start to finish. This was the best $5 I've spent. I can't wait to read the trilogy over and over again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a good game. I play it in the car alot. Really good. Really good. No cons just pros. 5 star all the way.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game will definitely get you hooked. It's fun and challenging without being ridiculously hard. Depending upon how often and how long you play, this game will have you entertained for hours. One of the best games for a buck I've bought in a while.
0805047905|5.0|This book is excellent for one to two year olds.  Large, pictures, little reading, sturdy, they won't destroy or get bored.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Good story line and heartfelt characters. Unfortunately the story lingered with to many descriptive details I got bored and skipped to the end.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|There is a lot more to Tina Fey than impersonating Sarah Palin perfectly -- although learning the inside story of how that came about and was done was great fun.  This book, which isn't so much a memoir as a personal glimpse at various segments of her life and her reactions to them, is witty, clever, and frequently choke-on-what-you're-drinking funny. And it isn't just a chick book -- men will enjoy it too. Bossy pants is great entertainment, and a perfect book to read when you just want to sit back and laugh -- a lot.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|can't wait until despicable me 2 comes out. My 3 year old and 1 year old daughters love this and the little minions.
1409136612|3.0|I usually love anything by Maeve Binchy, but I did not feel this was quite up to her normal standard - maybe because it was a quick read.  The character development was not quite the same as I've come to expect.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It was just an ok movie. My girls wouldn't sit through it so I made myself watch it just to get my money's worth.
0547884591|3.0|Huge book with lots of photos and pictures, but there is not a lot of information in it that I will use.  I was a bit disappointed with the content.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Sylvia, you're killing me.  Not to worry I will read all to do with Gideon & Eva, you couldn't stop me.  Waiting so long for this the 3 rd book, only to find out it doesn't Finnish yet.<br /><br />So much more to come, but let me just say EROTIC MUCH, I'm so exhausted from all the passion in this story.  Good god Gideon you are insatiable & a stallion.  My want to be Eva is so much more now.<br /><br />In the shadow of Gideon is where all other men are, love this man. Can't wait for the rest of the story, already know there is 2 more to come now.  Bring it on, give me my Alpha male, oh Gideon I do love you.  In my head I am Eva.<br /><br />Bring it on Sylvia, awesome read, more more more.
B000002L3P|5.0|If you like this band's music, this album is the core of your collection.  I just discovered him on Grooveshark, and this album really satisfies.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is good for telling u how much battery u have and predicting when it dies. But it's kinds worthless
B000002L5I|5.0|Music is a highly subjective topic, and I've usually opted for instrumental stuff.  This band really grabs me and tosses me around, however, and I like it.  This album has multiple tracks that I really enjoy.  Highly recommended if you enjoy southern blues rock as a steady diet or an occasional dessert.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft because it's so fun to play with friends and family so I also love minecraft because of  the blocks and animals that are in the game but I realized that there are horses so I really want the horses mod  and that's why I love minecraft.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I suppose it's reasonable to expect some die hard fans of this franchise to be super critical of something they became used to, however, it escapes my mind the lack of creativity which must reside within those negative reviews and makes me wonder just which movie had them on the edge of their seats because personally I have found great disappointment with the previous franchise holders and their lack of vision and many times storyline continuity; for example Star Trek V and the trip to the center of the galaxy which takes them mere hours to arrive, and yet in Star Trek Voyager the dilemma having been transported to the Delta Quadrant is supposedly going to take them many years to return. Perhaps they should have taken a shortcut through the center of the universe.<br /><br />All this aside I must say that the second installment had me completely engaged and refreshingly I had no idea what was around the next corner. The movie in my opinion was absolutely brilliant with so much to offer both Trek fans and non fans both.  The respect for story continuity and Trek lore is very evident and the crew work so well together it's amazing to watch something so well orchestrated. Of course my favorite scenes are those of the bridge and the Enterprise herself which this movie does so well in illustrating just how versatile and multipurpose the ship is, taking away some limitations that the older movies seem to impose on her.<br /><br />Just an amazing work by J.J.Abrahms and his team. I highly recommend not drinking or eating too much during this movie as going to the bathroom will only take you away from every delicious morsel this movie has to offer.
B009R659L8|4.0|As always Mary Higgins Clark does an excellent job of grabbing my attention and keeping it through the end of he book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is FABULOUS. DOWNLOAD NOW! I can't get enough. Additive and great fun for entire family. I adore this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Recommended for people who are in search of a simple yet tricky game. It takes a little brain power to enjoy it completely. Good for everybody! :)
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Loved it. It takes a really good movie for me to set through with my A.D.D. and not get restless. It had me glued to the screen not wanting miss a moment of it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|What's taking so long for the update to be on my kindle fire? Apple iPhone and iPod users have it already. Why. I am not a happy customer. This is ridiculous. When I'm due for a new device I'm switching to Apple. Because they have better service than you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really like the Downtown Abby Series. You began to feel as if you are friends of the family.This is my second time to watch them and can hardly wait for season 4 to come out!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I really don't know how to describe why I like this album . All I know is it sounds good and I'm glad I have it in my Maiden collection.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Broken,hurt and bloody inside your own mind..both of these strong wonderful characters come to life together..another epic book, just read it.. it will make you cry and smile an appreciate a simple smile of two sweet children who aren't..
1603427244|5.0|I'm sure that there other, possible larger, books out there that contain cast on and bind off techniques, but I really like this one.<br /><br />I find it to be well organized, well thought out and well illustrated. I have already learned a lot about cast-on and bind-off methods - I've even learned some new things about my &#34;go to&#34; methods that I had not known before.<br /><br />Methods are organized into categories . For cast-ons: basic, stretchy, decorative, circular, double sided, mult-color, provisional and tubular and mobius;  for bind-offs: basic, stretchy, decorative and sewn.<br /><br />I like the size because it's easy to keep in my knitting basket and, as always, I really like the fact that it has a spiral binding so it lies nice and flat or folds over easily.<br /><br />For me, this is a very useful book and contains information and instructions that I used to have to go searching the web for.  It's a definite keeper for me !
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an absolutely fabulous puzzle game. I was unable to put it down<br /> until I finished it!  Can't wait for more! I'm totally hooked!
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|I enjoyed the video and I always thought that Don Henley was the difficult one. but after seeing this dvd I believe Glenn Frye<br />is the egomaniacal one.  They should not have run Felder  off.  They  do not sound as good without him, and they have never been as good without Randy Meisner.  Glenn needs to calm down.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia, Don't listen to the negative reviews! I loved this book in every way! I love Gideon and Eva's story! I love that you let us enjoy their love story without the angst of constant break ups! I Don't know why people are so upset you are continuing their story! I can tell you that a lot of people are psyched!!! There are so many story lines to work with! I personally just want to see Gideon and Eva stay together through whatever turmoil they have to face. I love that through everything they have had to go through their relationship gets stronger and stronger. I didn't see the ending as a cliff hanger. Just more great story lines to look forward to! I love the mysteries, twists, erotic romance, and that we enjoy the growing intensity and love of Eva and Gideon. I can't wait for the 4th book and would be thrilled if there were a fifth! Two requests, please don't make us wait as long for book 4 as we did for 3 and keep Gideon and Eva together!
B002CNOA6S|5.0|what can you say except \\"most excellent. Definitely most excellent\\". a true classic with a heart. Oscar worthy performance by Dustin Hoffman.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The problem is that it is soooo good I can not stop playing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It Is addictive, for sure but quite the challange.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Of all the shows about attorney's and the law I have seen, this one kept me glued to the screen. I watched every single episode in 24 hours.  Even Trixie liked it! Not a bad actor in the show and everyone cast perfectly for their part.  You will laugh, you will get misty, and you WILL LOVE IT!<br />I can count all the shows I felt were worth rating on both my hands and this one made it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book makes a great literature read. The use of words are wonderful and yet makes you wish to understand more of their meanings.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Watchmen is more than a comic book and it's beyond most modern graphic novels.<br />The book includes a written story, giving us more than the panels and dialog found there.<br /><br />This isn't a story of joy, fun, and good old beating on the bad guys.<br />These heroes are normal folks who took up lives as crime fighters and patriots. They're human at heart though, or mostly anyway.<br /><br />Foibles, faults, and histories make these heroes less than the comic book heroes like Superman, Batman, and Captain America.<br /><br />Contains adult themes, violence, and the good guys aren't always that good.<br /><br />The quality of the art is wonderful and this rendition carries that well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as required reading for those into heroic fiction.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I thought the movie flowed well. I enjoyed some of the humor that was put in. Waiting for the follow up.
B00AK57N00|4.0|Good little time killer. Children will like it, too. But, 5.5 million downloads? I don't believe it. How<br />is it ppossible with only 7 reviews?
B00138KJY0|5.0|I believe this was the best Michael Jackson's album. This would have out sold Thriller album is MTV was old than. RIP MJ
B008F5YDRI|3.0|This film had some redeeming qualities, but had a weak story line.  It was difficult to get emotionally involved in the story due to the slowness of the action initially.
0805062971|1.0|I had to read for a college class, the instructor was crazy but this book and the movie are awful!  Save yourself from a complete waste of time - choose another book! The instructor at Santa Monica College loves this book though.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Excellent film, especially effective in HD.  Special effects and scenery were stunning. Actors were very convincing in their individual roles.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was very disappointed. It was boring and the characters seemed like totally different people than the ones I loved for so many of her books. I wish she would do a re-do and put more effort into her writing. If you feel you need to read how she decided to end her series, wait until you can check it out for free at the library.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This film was extremely difficult to track since it rapidly jumped from one time line to another.  Was unable to get involved in the plot or with the characters due to the disconcerting changes throughout the film.
B009OA57MI|5.0|My grandsons asked me for this game on my Kindle Fire. Best .99¢ I ever spent! They are alotted only 2 hours on my Kindle Fire and UNIDEN71 Android tablet tablet per night. They are both boys, and only aged 6 & 8. Even my 6 yr old knows how to play this one!  If you are looking for a good clean game then this is it.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Works well. Charges quickly, attaches easily, and has a nice length charging cord.  Should not have waited so long to order one!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Was more like a history lesson than a movie. Movie left out the Ford Theather and no mention of John Wilks Booth, was major part of Life of Lincoln. Disappointed...
B00881VLCE|3.0|a bit hard to manipulate the pieces on the more challenging puzzles.  generally pretty good though.  lots of great free photos too
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This will be the last time I buy anything from this author. After months of waiting and delays we get this total crap. I had enough.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Finally, a book where the male protagonist doesn't use the words \\"visage\\" and \\"besotted\\" (sorry Sawyer Bennett books, just sayin').  Everyone, from the main leads to the supporting characters, was so engaging, and then BOOM!, Drew drops that quip about Sister Mary Beatrice, the NILF, and I was done for (in a good way, of course).<br /><br />See me there, on the floor, laughing out loud?  It wasn't pretty.  It built and it built, until I was not just simply ROFL'ing. I'm talking tears streaming down my face (possibly mixed with snot) loud painful snorts, gasping for air, craughing for ten long minutes, pee on myself kind of undignified.  And then to my horror, I wasn't alone in the room anymore, so with a haughty sniff, I peeled myself off the floor and with a scornful glare at the offending intruders, I sashayed out of the room and made myself scarce, for the rest of the day.  I mean the whole book is interspersed with such LOL-inducing scenes, but I went to Catholic school, so sue me.<br /><br />The book felt so real and so authentic, I wanted to display stalkerish behavior and follow Drew and Kate and little MacKenzie as they went around their daily lives.  And the steam factor; out of this world hot.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor, come down with the flu, buy the book, lock yourself in your room for two days (unless you get off on having others seeing you as an undignified heap on the floor, and frankly, that's just sad).  And why two days you say? You're going to want to read the book all over again as soon as you're done.<br /><br />Bravo Emma Chase, we want, no, we NEED more books.
B001BJNIIK|3.0|I remember liking this movie when I saw it years ago. Stallone and Russell play off each other well, and the plot is reasonably interesting. A fun trip down memory lane.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Very informative with a clear writing style. Marvelous background coverage during my early stage of reading. I had to wait for the apt, installed by my son-in- law , to convert my i Pad to Kindel.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is tied for the best in the series with Sea of Monsters.  I loved it! Definitely better than the movie, though I loved the movie too!! A very good read for any one!
B007C7UZIG|4.0|The Steam app for Android is great. It's basically a port of your Steam on your computer, but without playing the games, of course. This app comes in handy for when you're in vacations or far from your computer, and you want to check out the deals, in case you miss one that you might want to buy. There's not much to say about the Steam app, since it does everything but playing games. I give the Steam App on Android a 4.2/5.0 because of the usefulness.
B00280LYIM|4.0|I absolutely love these books. It's not my favorite in the series, but still a great book to read. Awesome
B005K17RU0|4.0|The AccuWeather app is a great weather app, and it's free. The interface is very simple and easy to understand, you can add and remove cities so you can see their forecasts. The app shows you the current temperature, RealFeel, highs and lows of the day/week, shows forecasts for the next days, Google Maps of the current location you are viewing, and videos of forecasts. This app is simple and works as advertised. I really like all the handy features it comes with. I still prefer [[ASIN:B0064X7FVE The Weather Channel for Android]] but I think it's safe to say that AccuWeather ranks #2 in the best weather apps. I give AccuWeather a 4.1/5.0
B00280LYHS|4.0|This was a good book. I was, honestly, disappointed with the ending of the series but it wasn't too predictable. That's always a good thing.  Overall though I really liked it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Every book in this series just keeps getting better.  Sylvia Day is a must read Author if you have never read any of her books.<br /><br />Can't wait for the story to continue will Gideon and Eva ever be able to live there live without having to take on the Worlds problems?
B0095P31L6|5.0|Very good cartoon, Johnny depp does it again. I watch it over and over again, it's funny every time, I recommend this movie to kids and adults alike
193700788X|5.0|I couldn't put any of Charlaine Harris's books down and the final installment of the Sookie Stackhouse series was no exception.
0553062182|3.0|When today's frenetic world overwhelms me, I often find myself quoting William Wordsworth to myself:<br />\\"The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br />Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;--<br />Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br />We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\\"<br /><br />So, the subtitle of this book (\\"How to thrive when the world overwhelms you\\") had me buying a copy immediately.<br /><br />Although, I found it hard to read and, at times, Aron's habit of talking to a Highly Sensitive \\"Inner Child\\" was distracting, there was much useful information included in this book, particularly in helping to identify whether one is or isn't an HSP. By the end of the book, I did feel more accepting that what I've always seen as my \\"silly neuroses\\" are rather symptoms of having more fluid psychic boundaries than some other people. My new mantra from this book is \\"boundaries take practice!\\"<br /><br />Some interesting observations about how today's (Western) culture places a higher value on more aggressive, less sensitive types and how HSP's are more spiritually attuned (rather than bound by religion) made this a worthwhile read.
B001AG52AG|3.0|This was my favorite book as a kid. I haven't read it in at least 15 years (probably more), but it affected me so deeply that as I watched the movie I found myself being able to quote out lines from the book. That said, I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that it would be a different thing than the book and being okay with that. And I must say, I enjoyed it pretty much all the way through. It didn't capture what was so incredible and moving about the book, of course, but it was still an enjoyable fantasy ride.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you have read the book, prepare to be in for a shock at the end. I guess I shouldn't give it away, but it ends very differently from the book. To the point where I yelled in disgust at my screen. I was prepared to treat the movie as a different entity from the book, but I wasn't quite prepared for that. Lovers of the book, beware. You can enjoy this movie, but only if you divorce it completely from what moved you about the book and take it for what it is - an enjoyable, fairly fluffy fantasy movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is addictive with great special effects for a TV series. I can't wait for Season 3 to start tonight.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Definitely easily hooked on this game.  Good for a time waster.  Time flies when you are having fun.  Different levels make it more challenging.  Would recommend to any one.  Easy to play.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|you don't have to have friends to complete quests. the game is easy and the more you play the better it gets.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Excellent ,well written a mater piece of worthy information that will benefit any one regardless of age. This book covers all the areas that is vital , a must read for every one wanting to improve on their skills of great conversation and so much more. Would give it ten stars but as you can see only five is allowed.
1442337966|5.0|I have both The Secret book and DVD and I get a lot from both of them. I decided that I wanted to purchase the power in audio book form because I can listen to it where ever I am in my day. After reading the Secret a couple of times and also watching the Secret DVD, I felt I wanted to understand the process in more depth. The Power certainly gave me what I was looking for! Listening to Rhonda's words seemed to really help me &#34;get it&#34; I often will listen to one CD before I go to sleep at night or I have it in the car and also playing at home while getting ready for work. Lots of amazing things have been happening over these last few months and I know that this has been down to my shift in thinking. I am so aware of what I hear, feel and see around me every day and just how applying the  principles of the Secret & The Power has bought me so far. I LOVE reading, however, I do find the audio book gives just so much more.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|For all new readers of this series...WAIT!  It isn't a bad series - but the author is getting too big of a head and drawing it out.  Wait for the library to carry it...don't pay the money to purchase it. I was happy the third book was FINALLY released after having been delayed but was horribly disappointed after having read it.  It was more of the same from the first two books.  I expected that the trilogy would be drawn to a conclusion only to find that I will have to read more to see the end.  It is a pathetic attempt by the author to get more money out of her fans.  Well, she lost a fan with this book.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|Finally a Robin Hood that captures the true nature of Robin Hood and Maid Marian! And everyone stayed in character  with good diction of the period. I would love to see another one!
B005TBN3EU|4.0|I found it just as good as the first one, funny and worth the time. Once again, Zach Galifinakis is the best part.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|The scenarios were very believable...I've lived them! Barbara is still a great actress and Seth Rogan played the perfect guilty son.
B0054SMID0|4.0|A good movie with lots of twists and turns. Only problem is if you read the book you know all the turns and the movie can be a little slow.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Goods ands chew creative vanilla base but it says unauthorized access to make sure the steering wheel on the help they
B006LSZECO|5.0|I like it when  a book not only entertains me but challenges me as well. Some of the scenarios were really far out but I kept turning the pages. A well written tale.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|A  nice feel  good family cartoon flick.kids enjoyed it and I have to admit that I liked it also.nuff said.
0515123447|3.0|If you have a lengthy flight scheduled, pick this book up. As an author, I prefer the writing of Vince Flynn or John Sanford over the writing of Lee Child by a good margin. It is important to note that Mr. Child's writing will hold your attention. I am not sorry I bought and read the book now that I have no new novels by either Vince Flynn or John Sanford to read.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|good story line but a little gritty and onerous for me.would have enjoyed it more without the bad language from 'MoM'.,
B009NY43NY|1.0|This is the first time I have ever written a review on Amazon. I buy tons of books and read them on my Kindle.  Unlike Laurell K. Hamilton, who I stopped reading four books ago, I continued on reading Charlaine Harris' Sookie books.  The last few were not that good, but I trudged along.  The final book was terrible.  Poor writing, inconsistencies in the &#34;Sookie&#34; universe, and a sloppy ending really turned this into a disappointing finale.  SPOILER ahead (not that you may already know about it).... The first half of the book all she does is clean her house! Seriously?  Then there is the parade of &#34;this is your life&#34; of past characters coming to see her.  They didn't need to be there.  I could go on and on, but every other review has perfectly captured what was wrong with this book.  It's a disservice to readers to finish a series without continuity.  I could care less who Sookie ended up with as long as it made sense.  This doesn't do it.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A modern day masterpiece - of course, it is a term loosely tossed around but this book is so skillfully sculptured and with such depth and width, I arrive at the end of this journey with the words Master Piece on my lips.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Heartwarming story - a great reflection of life.  Easy enjoyable read.  nine more words are required so I will just say good.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is the latest in the Bosch series. I have read them from the start. Like all the others, I enjoyed it very much.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|The special effects still continue to hold up. Form needs to follow fiction. Just a couple more years until 2019.
B007HO392S|4.0|Definitely love this album.  Two Black Cadillacs is my favorite.  It lets your mind create any scenario you choose...  My first purchase of Carrie Underwood's Albums, but won't be my last.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a Lover of minecraft  the only thing that I do not like is that you have to be super close to the person that u r playing a WiFi game with to connect<br />This app could  just one more update.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|His work is always uplifting to me.  Great variationin this album.  Can't wait for his next album.  Always a fan.
B0094M2NTG|5.0|This is one of the most down to earth love story's I have seen in a long time.  It's every emotion tied into the lives of this  unforseeing couple
B00BXHE0CI|4.0|It's not terrible. In fact, parts of it hit me as exhilarating right away. However, so far, none of the songs have grabbed me the way the last 2 records did. It's still Dillinger, so it doesn't suck.<br /><br />Update: I'm diggin' it more and more.
B0094M2Z9O|4.0|I love this movie but this one wasn't meant for my big screen... I wanted to see it big and bold
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The book was good, I enjoyed it. However it took a long time to get going and I expected more from the story. Overall a good read
B009KEN87O|5.0|good game nice on galaxy s 2 thank you, cool bosses, turned off vibrate to save battery life and it was better after that.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|The children love the video. They havent stopped watching the video&#62; the digital copy is the best part. Works well with Apple TV.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This story brought tears to my eyes, because this is a true story about the real Americans giving their lives for our country and our security. Every American should know what they do for us.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The children love the video. They havent stopped watching the video&#62; the digital copy is the best part. Works well with Apple TV.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Final Fantasy II is great.  Well worth the $$.  Plays lovely on the Kindle Fire.  I'm really enjoying the game so far and my only complaint is that they haven't ported the rest of the series over yet.  It's on iPad so it should be easy enough to port to Android.  Come on and get Final Fantasy 1, 2, 4, and 5 on the Amazon store.  They are all ready to be ported over.  I'm ready to spend the money.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Funny, sexy, with an actual story, told from the man's perspective. I didn't even mind he was stereotypically rich. Can't wait for more from Emma Chase.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I am working through my house room by room getting rid of stuff that don't need. Donating books, selling things I don't need and reducing what I live with daily.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a great book but you really need to get on with it and stop with the next book.  Give us what we are so desperately needed and that is to see what happens to the end.  If there is another book after the next one I will not buy no matter how good it is.  End it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I don't like zombies.  They terrify me on a visceral level. This book was about humanity trying to survive something horrific on a global scale.  It was their stories and it sucked me in like nothing else could have.  I hated it because it felt so real and I loved this book because I felt the survivors pain so intensely.  Definitely worth reading and I am going to see the movie because of how good this was (remember zombies make me shudder) - still I am going to see the movie because of the quality of the book!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I really enjoy his music...since I was a teenager. This album is going to be one of his best. Can't wait to see him in concert fall of 13 in chicago
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This book was choosen by a member of my book club - I really enjoyed this book found myself laughing out loud at certain parts - a bit of &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; here with Alan Karlsson finding himself in some interesting situations - aspects of historical moments that have changed the world over the last 60 plus years - I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved it because there was so many things you could do like mining or building a house and its great .
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is by far THE best game in the WORLD.  if i were u i would totally get it. the price does not martter

B005K01VZS|5.0|A truly amazing book. Fantastic, but Tuesdays with Morrie still takes the cake as his best. Mitch Albom is the bomb!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|It was a good movie. I arrived quickly.  I bought it for a xmass gift.  The movie was fun to watch more than once.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Have not seen the movie yet. But really looking forward to it. Love the different worlds. The flying monkey are great
B000OLRH10|5.0|I watch Blood Diamond at least three times a year.  I don't know what it is about this movie but I just love it.  It makes me cry and I feel caught up in the drama of its political causes.  It seems that Leonardo Di Caprio has finally grown up and his romance with Jennifer Connelly is realistic.  The story of blood diamonds touches me greatly and I can't see myself buying a diamond again even with surety of its being clean.  The acting is superb, the story mesmerizing and it's one of my movie icons.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Since I have my Kindle I no longer can sit and read a &#34;real&#34; book.  Being able to adjust the font size so I do not have to have reading glasses is wonderful.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|\\"World War Z\\" is unique, well-written, ambitious, and propulsive. It is also ultimately heartless. Crammed with post-war 'interviews' that describe the progress of 'the Walking Plague' across the globe, the novel never really tells a coherent story of the titular War, never even brings the various personal story arcs to a satisfactory resolution. Brooks relies heavily on the 'shared experience' excuse: because every character in the novel has lived through the war, they casually toss out terminology, slang, names and vague references to events that may be partially explained a hundred pages later, or not at all. For all the book's ambitious scope, it is difficult not to see this as simply lazy, have-it-both-ways writing. It also seems unlikely that our unidentified interviewer, the man ostensibly compiling all these disjointed stories, would actually organize the account this way. And though this account exists to collect and memorialize the stories of survivors, to put a human face on an earlier, purely factual government report of the war, most of these stories completely lack a sense of emotion and investment. The whole thing seems as cold as the original report it is supposed to improve upon.<br /><br />My other major gripe with the narrative: the way Brooks sets up the mechanics and biology of infection, it seems utterly impossible that humans could have ever 'won' the war, or eradicated the zombie threat- is this his bleak 'moral' of the story, that the war will never be truly over, or is it a plot hole? Is the ease of transmission intentional, meant to point out the futility of the recovery, or is it proof that Brooks simply didn't think through the different ways tiny pieces of contaminated flesh could enter the human body? Some routes of reinfection are addressed; the most glaring, the slowly decomposing zombies roaming through the world's oceans/water supply, is not. If you are going to change the bite=infection formula, you had better have a clear and consistent explanation for transmission.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a great concept spoiled by its own format and its objective point of view. If we could only engage with some of the stories, Brooks might have created a terrifying classic of the zombie genre; instead we get something fascinating and yet, strangely, bloodless.
1595828753|5.0|I loved the series when it was on nickelodeon and then rematches it more recently. When I saw the story continued in various graphic books - I knew I needed to read them and they did not disappoint!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|BEST movie I've seen in a long, long time.  I was born in 1949 so I remember some of these women and their maids and how they treated them.  It had a lot of funny parts but as I child I never knew how badly some of our parents treated them.  I was crying at the end but it was for their happiness.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this movie to everybody.  Outstanding!!!
B0085LUEMK|5.0|Being a self taught graphic designer, I like to continually learn new tips, ideas, and design elements. This book was a great addition to my library.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Tom Cruise did a good job with his role.  I thought a guy in his character's situation would look a bit more ragged around the edges and in need of a haircut and shave, but I did enjoy the movie because it's a good tale and has good heroes and bad guys.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is fun. I use it to pass time with thought and it fills the square. It's nice that they start easy and progress in difficulty.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|It's rather silly to see so many \\"reviews\\" that say squat about the movie, but instead complain about the packaging.  Do you REALLY think Amazon makes policy for Disney? Or that Disney will slam the brakes on, and include 2D with the US 3D release because people complain on Amazon? GET REAL.  For all you that like to type, but not read, may I point out the review that appears 1ST here?  You know, the one that if you bothered to read....you would find the Amazon UK link for the 2D-3D set?  The REGION FREE set? Hint: it's here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BL1BIP8<br /><br />Now, on to the movie.  I have to agree with others that Franco and Kunis ARE the weak links here. Their roles are played like a Saturday Night Live skit that had only one rehearsal...and neither really FIT the parts. Bad acting of a couple characters aside, the movie was quite watchable, and could have been a GREAT movie if more attention had been played to cast and detail.<br />The movie looked kind of \\"disjointed\\". Certain areas of the film were wonderfully done, while other \\"3D moments\\" just looked cheap and cheesy. Finley and China Girl, were great additions to this prequel, and brought a modern-yet-classical look to the film.  I enjoyed the movie, flaws and all. Not a GREAT movie, but a good watch.  Children will get a kick out of it, adults too if they can refrain from comparisons to the original Wizard of Oz.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Great album, I would recommend this classic to those who have heard it and even more to those who might not know Bob Marley!!!!!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Classic Arnold.  Worth the cost of the rental.  Plenty of action and funny at the same time.  Worth the rental.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I'm disappointed in this story it's becoming so drug out that I'm looking interest. There is so much confusing plot that I won't remember come the time I read book 4, I'm over it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So totally frustrated,  can't believe we were left hanging AGAIN!  The book was great, but beware the ending isn't really an ending.  Got to wait again....
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Lots of interesting puzzles.  Different style to puzzles I really have had a lot of fun.  Get this one.  Love it
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Supposed to be the conclusion ...now there are two more? This book didn't end - it stopped! There was little story about any of the major characters that had not already been done!  I loved the first two books and waited AGES for this one -Won't bother with another.

B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book is truly a way to raise your self-awareness and also gain greater consciousness. Ultimately, it teaches you how to find  inner peace and happiness on your own, without getting so caught up in the society social branding. It's about living your life as a free spirit, with integrity and acommittment to yourself to be an impeccable person. It's written in such a simple way with great stories. One of the most important readings in my life. Erica Elias, Author

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is brilliant. Awesome and realistic graphics. I love the app my horse. keep up the fascinating work. Gooooo !
B001MTENOC|5.0|Anyone who has ever wondered what really happens to us after physical death needs to read this book with an open mind. It has the power to transform what is still the almost universal, widespread ignorance of the actual process involved in the time following the end of our lives on earth. Dr Newton reports what his clients have told him under deep hypnosis in a remarkably balanced way, with no personal religious dogma of his own intruding on what he has heard. Utterly brilliant!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a hell of a story.  The constant struggles with the two of them was frustrating and gratifying to see how much they really love each other. That when you love someone so much it is worth the battle.

B0062OCNAI|5.0|Beautifully written novel, with themes of family love and devotion, betrayal, and learning to let go.  And the concept of afterlife thrown in the mix makes it intriguing and gripping.  Truly loved it.
B0034G4P9E|4.0|I cannot say enough good things about this film. I admit it was Jennifer Morrison that drew me to the movie, but it was the cast and the terrific story that kept me interested. Tom Hardy is very good in the role of the bitter brother and you can tell he really beefed up for the role (he wasn't nearly as big back when he was in Star Trek: Nemesis). Joel Edgerton looks to have moved on his from his Star Wars days and is making a name for himself. He plays the never say die father of two who not only pushes himself to the limit in the ring, but also tries his damnedest to mend old wound between he and his brother.<br /><br />Nick Nolte plays a sobered up father to both Hardy and Edgerton and gives arguably the best performance of his career. Not to be undone, Jennifer Morrison also gives a solid effort and is a standout in a film that has testosterone flowing through it.<br /><br />The MMA fight scenes are well choreographed and gritty. They feel very real and you can tell they brought in some people from the world of MMA to make sure they did those scenes justice.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a great piece of work and I have to say it's a pity that it didn't do better at the box office.<br /><br />With all that being said, I have to admit I am a little disappointed in the blu ray transfer. I understand a film like this is going to have a little grit in the film and be a little grainy. The problem is, at times, there is so much grain that it detracts from the film's efforts. I expect some grain during night scenes, but in some of them there was so much of it that it was hard to make out certain objects. Even during the daytime scenes where grain usually isn't a problem turned out etched and often felt like there wasn't a huge amount of effort into transitioning this brilliant movie into a format that would do it justice. The sound was alright, but there were a few scenes where I had to adjust the volume to hear all the dialog.<br /><br />For the film - 4.1 / 5<br />For the BR xfer - 2.2 / 5For the BR xfer - 2.2 / 5
B0031R5K68|5.0|Brilliantly written and on the edge suspense all the way.  There were some unexpected surprises.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0036TGSJ4|4.0|I was able to pick up this blu ray for about $8. I'd heard good things about it, but it was Emma Stone that sold me on the purchase. She's always such a doll in her films. From Super Bad to Gangster Squad to The Amazing Spider Man, she's always come off very likeable even if her character wasn't all that great.<br /><br />The script itself is well written and has some very spiky banter throughout. For a movie that was shot on a budget of only 8 million dollars, it also boasts some fairly solid production value. Emma, as usually, does a very good job playing the teen who starts off as average only to soon be labeled the school harlot. While she wasn't always the source of all the jokes, the timing she had with her co stars was spot on. It felt very natural for her to be in this role. While you will not doubt recognize many of the other stars in the film, none stick out more than Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play the parents. There is obvious chemistry there and their time on screen is often filled with witty banter and off the cuff advice that makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />Thomas Hayden Church was likeable and he filled his role quite well. It was a big change from the last film I'd seen him in (Sideways), but he pulled it off nicely. Lisa Kudrow also did well as the philandering guidance counselor...and then there is Amanda Bynes. Putting aside all the recent news about her and her personal problems, she did pretty well in this film. Her scene were often awkward, but that was the idea behind them. She may not have been the headlining star in this picture, but I don't think she should feel any sort of shame for her performance here.<br /><br />Overall, the film was enjoyable and funny and something that has actual moral lessons that aren't thrown in your face. Some scenes were a little too silly, but the witty dialog makes up for some of the awkwardness.<br /><br />As far as the Blu Ray Transfer, the picture was very good. There was very little grain and the coloring was spot on. My only issue was it felt at times that the sound did not match up with the picture. It felt as if it were off for maybe half a second during a couple of scenes so be aware of that. For me, it wasn't too much of a distraction as that issue was only present for about 5 minutes of the film.<br /><br />4.2 / 5d the coloring was spot on. My only issue was it felt at times that the sound did not match up with the picture. It felt as if it were off for maybe half a second during a couple of scenes so be aware of that.

B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|film is excellent - problem is I streamed in on Amazon prime for $4.95, paying the extra amount for the High Def version. IT WAS NOT HD! What a rip off; can't figure out how to get my money back - or a credit...
B008XTVWHK|5.0|I've always been a fan of Ray Harryhausen and Gwangi is a particular favorite of mine.  The print is clear and I'm pleased to be able to have this on dvd to watch over and over again.  I like the extra Return to the Valley especially. My only complaint is I wish it was in a keepcase instead of the cardboard type.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is much more fun than one would think for a simple 3D game lol. I'm still skeptical if spending real money on this is worth it.
B00AK57N00|3.0|Pretty simple game, and as such, I got bored pretty quickly.  Amazon has that great Test Drive feature on this app so try before you buy.  I didn't think the tilting worked thst great.  But if you -  or more likely your kids or grandkids - like it, it's  a good time waster...
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|My family loved the movie. We were on the edge of our seat the entire time.  There is violence, but nothing gory or too scary.  We highly recommend watching this movie!
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Great movie! Lots of action and adventure, heroism, virtue and honor.  His willingness to sacrifice his life for others is what makes his character awesome.
B0037QO8XE|4.0|I had heard about this movie from friends and it didn't disappoint.  It had a powerful message and the acting was superb.  I would recommend this to others but I think women would enjoy it more.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was written by a neurosurgeon, so it was, of course very technical and somewhat dry.  I was looking for something else, I guess.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|it was a wonderful book.  i loved it.  just saw the movie and it was as exciting as the book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was quite possibly the worst book I have read this year. I am incredibly disappointed, the storyline jumps all over the place, and as other reviewers have stated it just ends. And rather abruptly. I will be returning it, and do not intend to finish Gideon and Eva's story, even though I fell in love with them. Sylvia Day ruined a good thing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was the best I read in awhile. Wanted more. Sad it ended please keep up the good eork

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This held my attention. As a lawyer I found the courtroom scenes very entertaining although there were a few liberties taken with procedure. I thought the politics within the D.A.s office were interesting. The result of the court case was, in my opinion, a cop-out, taking the easy road, but the ending of the book was a total surprise.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|My DVR missed this episode so I had to pick it up on Amazon.<br />Most awsome zombie show ever created period.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|There's no doubt Orphan Black is the best show on television this year period.  And Tatiany Maslany has given the most outstanding performance(s) as Sarah Manning, Beth Childs, Sarah playing Beth, Helena, Helena playing Beth, Helena playing Sarah, Allison Hendrix, Allison playing Sarah, etc, etc, etc.  Any single one of these characters would be an outstanding performance by a young actress...She does them all.  Simply amazing.  But, in addition OB has the blessing of fine, tight writing...A solid sci-fi vision grounded in reality, and a great supporting cast.  Jordan Gavaris as Sarah's foster brother Felix, Kevin Hanchard as tragic Beth Childs' partner Arthur Bell, Michael Mando as Vic (fondly Vic the Dick), Dylan Bruce as monitor Paul, the great Matt Frewer as Aldous Leekie, Maria Doyle Kennedy as foster mother Mrs. S., Kristian Bruun as husband Donald \\"Donnie\\" Hendrix, Natalie Linsinka as snoopy neighbor/bf/?monitor Aynesley Norris and others give a powerful grounding to the series, with Gavaris' Felix outstanding as Sarah's beloved foster brother and rock and particular kudos to Hanchard's Bell, trying to understand and help his disintegrating partner.
B009FHRRAA|1.0|Why is this listed under classic rock, nothing classic about it, I'll unless yelling, screaming, and lack of talent has somehow become classic rock! When I get an advertisement for classic rock I'm looking to view and hear bands that have talent to play instruments and sing, not distortion and noise, this will never be considered classic rock, 20 years old or not! I tell you what, when these so called \\"grunge\\" bands sound like hendrix, zeppelin, skynard, then they'll be considered classic rock, which will be never!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the sweetest, most thought provoking books I've read in a long time.  I can't stop thinking about the characters and the wonderful way the book was written.  A good reminder that everyone has their own unique and equally important perspective.  A beautiful story about kindness, the power of love and the lessons we can all learn from a 5th grade boy and his amazing family, friends and teachers.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the sequel. Good plot, interesting characters, and it was well written. The author was quite creative and was able to balance an exciting plot with the building of a relationship.

0425263924|5.0|I loved Entwined with You!! EWY picks up right where Reflected in You ends. Eva now understands why Gideon suddenly pushed her away. Both have to deal with the consequences of Gideon's decisions. It really seemed like both Eva and Gideon evolved and changed. While they remain jealous and possessive of the other, they seem better able to deal with how other people interfere in their relationship. To a degree, they are more trusting of the other and their relationship. They know the other is committed to making a relationship work.<br /><br />They still face a number of obstacles. Corinne and Brett are still around and determined to reclaim the relationships they once had. The circumstances around Nathan's death don't magically disappear and new information is discovered. Other people and incidents from their pasts also come back to haunt them. Eva also has to address some issues with her parents. Monica's need for money and peace of mind concerning Eva's safety once again become contentious issues and their relationship is significantly altered.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon's relationship also grew and changed for the better. While they still have this amazing chemistry, they fight less and talk about their problems, issues, and concerns. I loved the banter between them in this book. They also share more quiet moments where they can just enjoy being together.<br /><br />And Gideon. Ah, Gideon. I love him even more. He has so many fabulous lines that showcase his love and devotion to Eva. He continues to open up and tell Eva things about his past despite his fears that Eva will leave him.<br /><br />Poor Cary. My heart goes out to him. He's still recovering from his injuries and he struggles with Eva's behavior. He also gets some interesting news. I hope Cary's life becomes less dramatic in the next books. I would love for him to be more settled and to find romantic relationship(s) that give him what he needs.<br /><br />I have no problem with the series being extended.Gideon and Eva have a lot of damage to work through...and I just want more Gideon!

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I so wish Ramin and Sierra had been in this DVD since they were the people who were first in the stage production.  Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne are good, and the production is well worth watching.
B0011Z31V8|4.0|Great Selections good price- only 1 song that was not one of my Favs. Prince fans will not be disappointed.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Great production-Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler are good.  Love all the extra details the movie brings--carriages, horses, sword fight--well worth watching.
B00B2G4OUS|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows right now, if not the best. At first, Ryan Hardy's character seams to be very unorganized and not well positioned into the show as a whole. I mean would you really run after a killer, whom almost killed you, into a house at night without a gun? Probably not, but Ryan's character really does mold into a beautiful craft of art. This show will keep you on your toes trying to figure out what's going on, and the plot twist are transformed flawlessly throughout the series. It's really a very neat and engaging experience as a viewer that leaves you in the end very unsettled yet well anticipated for what's to come next in the life of Ryan Hardy.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|Number one..I love full screen movies.  This movie is warm, funny, loving and full of musical talent. The dance scene at the club and the last dance number at the school was &#34;the bomb&#34;.  Tatum is indeed Mr. Flexible.
B007WPM7SO|1.0|A rating of PG is outrageous.  The explicit  overreach of sexual content is beyond the pale.  This is not a movie for children, teens, twenties, thirties etc......Movie studios need to wake up to their responsibility to the milieu.  When Almighty God told us not to break the Commandments,  He Meant It. A wink and nod has been given to the Movie studios and now we live with the consequences  and spiritual cost of all of it.  Must I explain the difference between love and lust or do most of you get it?  The acting was horrible, the story line was chopped up and the unredeeming end was a poor excuse for a movie. My Uncle fought in the Great War so believe me when I tell you that the men did not sit around the trenchs WHNING. They fought and died to win our freedom from tyranny by pushing the enemy back to Berlin.  This movie belongs in the hall of shame.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This little calculator is great. The buttons are a good size and big enough that I don't accidentally press the wrong one. Easy to use and designed well.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this product for school. We read a lot of journal articles in my degree, so downloading them as pdfs and using them on my kindle saves time and money. Although you can read pdfs on the kindle fire without this app, it tends to scramble them when you convert them. Additionally, you can't write notes, highlight important parts, or underline key words. In this app, you can. This app has saved me so many trees this year, and my study time was cut down because I can look over important articles in spare moments.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Got this to have some fun with my nieces. So far so good. Not havein. fun myself too. So if your looking for what seems like a good one. Then give this a shot.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I've seen all of the other planet of the ape movies, but I didn't buy any of them. this planet of the apes I bought a copy.....<br />I LOVE IT  plain and simple
0761944524|5.0|Reading a textbook is usually not fun, but this book makes statistics fun and interesting! It is studying with your old brother who loves Anime!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|The characters each have their own stories which become part of the anticipation of each new series. Some you hate -others you despise but you can not shake the hook of &#34;what is going to happen next.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this just Wish it were longer I would love to play more I hope for more soon
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I thought that I would be watching a cute little family movie. It was the most offensive movie I have ever watched. I heard the worse language I ever heard in a movie and X rated sexual off color scenes. THE WORSE! I am so glad I did not make an assumption and let my children watch this movie.
B008JFUP8A|5.0|Excellent concept and story of a man mentoring his son, while dealing with life and death issues.  Superior acting by Jaden in only his third film.  Look for more from this guy.  This is my first M. Night film and I will be checking out more.  Bravo Will Smith who wrote the story.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is the best game ever I just downloaded a  couple of minutes ago and I am on level seven
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I really liked this movie and it came with a second disc of bonus features now I just need to get the complete version
B009NX88JU|5.0|best movie to watch with your gay lover. I recommend this video for all. especially good with popcorn and a nice Hot Dog !!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Bought this for my wife's birthday and she loves Rod Stewart and she loves this CD. Now her brother's going to buy it too.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I read Orphan Train in 2 days because I simply could not put it down.  Gripping from the beginning, weaving the two lives of the main characters so interestingly, I felt close to the characters, which I look for when losing myself in literature. I also loved learning about this part of our nation's history.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|It was a good game! It had excellent graphics and an in getting plot. It did glitch up once and I had to start over but I suspect that was more to do with my kindle than the game.
B000VMBXNA|3.0|Kinda dry...Interesting topic but not very interesting to read.  It needs some charm, humor, wit.  I didn't finish it and I didn't carde.
0788858408|5.0|it was the best ever . Have given the DVD to my nephew and  he passed it around to all his friends (12)
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady A is by far the hottest musical group in country music.<br />From beginning to end, anexcellent piece of work.<br />Great harmonies and vocals.
B0017CW5J4|4.0|I was expecting a bit more acting from the blue man group, but it was mostlythe band that did the mayority of the work.<br />Some what entertaining.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|This is by far not the best work from Lady A.<br />Overall , it's a good CD, but seems it was rushed out to continue the monmentum they have built up.<br />Excellent group live in concert.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is one of the very best of the series. It can stand alone as a story. Needless to say, Daniel Craig is super! The Broccoli Legacy lives on splendidly!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|the first book was so good I had to immediately get this book too, and I couldn't put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great series! I could hardly put the book down! Very suspenseful! Now I ll be searching for more books by the author!
0679805273|5.0|I am using this a project and its perfect. The story is great and means a lot for my long term project
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This app it fun for kids and is really entertaining if u liked flow then u will like this better if u liked bridges it is just like tht but no bringes in it and it is neon colors and sparkly.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|This film moved me. Emotionally, and sometimes physically sick to my stomach. Any time a film can do that, it's usually a pretty good sign. It's very hard to watch many of the scenes in this film (again this is a good thing) as the acting is so good you really stop looking at it as acting and just watch these poor people go through a miserable existence, and really feel for them. There are scenes that at the end you'll be like &#34;oh....jesus....that is just.....aagh&#34;, in those words exactly. Another film that does this to you is Requiem For A Dream. I'm not really comparing the two, as they are different films, but this film has a similar affect. Great film, great acting. The actors aren't even actors in the film, they are real people, real problems, and it's just. God it's good. Watch. Please.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What more can I say? My Kindle now charges as it should. I have two chargers now to keep one in the car.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game, very addictive.. have to limit my time on this one, can play for hours! So very glad I got this one...
0316223239|5.0|Awesome summer read. Very interesting! If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this book is it. Really makes you think! Enjoy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Superb story within a story. The acting is wonderful. Well developed characters and plot. The story line is wonderful. Just got season 3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|WHEN IS THE UPDATE GOING TO COME!!! but it is a really fun game I think that everyone should have minecraft.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|its a great fugitive action movie for those guys who like these kind of movies, will recommend to my friends
B00B1MHA18|5.0|It's all about the raw energy and sound of this album. Charlie uses that harmonica like no one else and Harper's vocals are blended perfectly with the guitar. Great album!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|It does not show the correct hours left on the battery but shows just the correct percentage left. Maybe I just read it wrong.
B003B96AOW|4.0|I liked how many accessories the action figure came with. However, a piece from one of the handguns broke when I was taking it out of deadpool's hand. It seems that some of the plastic was cheaply made. Still an awesome figure though!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Dr. Who... It is scifi that doesn't take itself too seriously.... but the fans sure take it seriously! Give it a try!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This was a really good book. Cant wait until the next book comes out. I just love his writing style taking us back in time.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's closer to the actual game than stupid imitations, but it still needs constant updating. In the next update they need to bring it closer to computer level by adding Redstone and more mobs, etc.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is a life changer. It is so simple and yet so powerful.. We have the world at our fingertips if we only just ask for what we want and be grateful for what we have.
0785168109|5.0|I really like this book alot. It comes in a cool slip case and nice sturdy book. I really enjoy the concept art in the book and the storyboards. It has weapon concepts, mandarin concepts, etc. Really good book I mean I don't like the fact that are movie screenshots in the book but other then that love it.
1451629184|5.0|This is a well written, easy to read book. I read it in one day. It's a true story about her capture.
159463176X|4.0|I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns so I couldn't wait to read this one.  A bit confusing at times with names of characters and the way he jumped back and forth in their lives but the ending made up for all that.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I'm writing this review to warn ppl about this poorly written show. First off this is a show that puts me in the mind of what would happen if the creator of twilight got with the creator of sex and the city and made a show this is what you would get. Of course this is an HBO series and they know only one thing and that is that sex sells. If you want to watch a g rated porno then this is for you. Another thing is terrible actors why they picked the girl that played rogue in xmen idk but it was a bad choice. Too much goin on also because this show starts out with a bunch of bar workers as a big family and eventually they all split and have their own lil stories so when you begin to take interest in one character they move on to the other people and by the time they get back to what you were intersted in you don't care or you have forgot about what's goin on by then so its like who cares??? I've watched about all the way to season two and I believe I will stop their. If you wanna waste your time on watching this you would be better off watching a porno. However if you want to see a real horror show check out the walking dead its 10x's better than this terrible show.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Hope the new book comes out soon!! No release date??? I can't wait to find out what will happen next!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is really fun.  It starts out easy and shows the instructions as you go along.  I put it on my boys' kindles as well and they are both playing it right now.  The mark of a good game to me is if you have 3 different age groups all playing and enjoying it.  Usually the games I like my kids don't like, and vice versa.  This game makes you think about the logical solution and shows cause and effect.  I think it's good for your reasoning skills, and I would look forward to additional levels so we can play more. I also loved the fun sound effects and cute little pudding blobs with moustaches.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I truly gave this book a chance, but it is beyond difficult to enjoy the story when you mind is distracted by the improbability in almost each page/chapter.  The days would have to be a lot longer than 24 hours for the hero to accomplish the actions and distance traveled.  Also a gift of a falcon for someone in such a low position who would have no time to devote to care and it is bonded instantly? Really? Also finding a newly born animal and giving it ale? Does the hero live on air?  The writing is childish, repetitive and often contradictive. Also things like the hero not understanding why others in the legion don't like him even after being told several times leads one to believe he is obtuse or stupid. Or the hero's need to protect the king but gets distracted by everything. I agree with most of the lower ratings, no character development.  The main issue for me is what could have been a good story was killed by poor writing.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great book Sylvia Day. I'm glad we get more of the Crossfire series. I will purchase books 4 & 5 when they go live.I'm loyal to Gideon and Eva's story to see them get their HEA which I know will happen at some point.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well I have had this game for over two years now and it is fun for kids to try to beat there friends nd it keeps you on your fingers because you have to pay attention
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love playing  game but gave up after three different times that it updated game and deleted all my progress. I started over three times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun, addicting, and always great to play. I give it 5 stars, it's hours of subway surfin fun for you.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I loved the first season of this series! Just started the second...and so far it's as good as the first!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Its the best series ever. It's better then the fifty shades trilogy. You dont find yourself in a cliche story like most others.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Good little puzzle game. Can get challenging at times if you want to get three stars on every level, but overall it won't take most people long to get through the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game play this game every single day.best game download it now if u wish to experience the world's awesome game
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have to say that I was thinking Sookie had gone through way too much in this last book when combining it with all the other books. For that reason alone I am relieved.  It has been a great series
0425263924|1.0|Let me sum the book up for everyone. Absolutely no plot what so ever. Here is the book in a nut shell<br />Eva: \\" I love you. Lets have sex.\\"<br />Gideon: \\"Crossfire. Lets have more sex\\"<br /><br />That's it no plot. I guess she is saving the plot for the next book or has she run out of ideas.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Works for HTC Sensation! Even for OEM.battery..really like the temperature feature as well.<br /><br />I am looking forward to am update that actively manages the battery life..Alerts for when battery overheats or warnings based on custom limits would also be great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game in the whole wide world. I love it so much expesholly zoe.it is very awesome
B00992CF6W|3.0|You can't open crafting tables or chests in this game. Please fix it is very annoying. there are only some ore constructed items
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Its not 300 or any of the Titan moveis (Clash or Wrath) but it is still a good story. The first time I watched it I thought \\"Ok\\" but I put it up for 6 months and then watched it again. I enjoyed it much more the second time around. I love Greek mythology and movies made in that time- So this shouldn't disappoint. It is a bit dark on screen, but I think that lends to the story. I love the character of Theseus and how he is presented. I'm glad I bought the movie and will watch it multiple times more.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|It is rare these days to have a clean movie. Good job with this film. I hope more positive movies will be produced.
B009R659L8|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read by Mary Higgins Clark. I couldn't put it down. It kept me at the edge of my seat.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. I'm surprised we have yet to buy this movie. The horse is my favorite.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so fun and the horses are so detailed! It is amazing to see all of the different horses (the zebra is my favorite)! I LOVE this game!!!
B0050F6JQE|5.0|This 10cd box set of Victoria's Sacred Works is so beautiful, so sweet, its a must for everyone. Nothing sets off my morning in a better way than listening to this music, it clears my mind and my heart of all disturbances and distresses due to the world and its problems and difficulties. It clears the tensions and stresses and restlessness out of the air and mind, like a great wind drives the dark clouds away. There truly is something of the Sacred in this music and I highly recommend it, with 10 stars if I could. Even if you cannot find it cheaper in very good condition in the Used section, but must pay the full price for the new box set on Amazon, don't hesitate, it is 10cds of immaculate perfection and beauty. I cannot say enough about Tomas Luis de Victoria and his music, but it will suffice to say that he was truly inspired by the Heavenly choir to compose this music.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show! It has everything romance,politics,crime,mystery. Very well done. Keeps your interest and waiting for more. Excellent series!!
B004ELSDZK|5.0|I found the game fun but not unrealistic in its challenge.  Actually beating the puzzles felt like it was within the real of my skills rather than the game cheating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft p.e. is great it lets you use your imagineaion in a world of color and blocks. it is enjoyable for all ages and of course portable.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Oh my goodness, I blew through this bad boy in a week.  I could not put it down, it always felt like there was one more run or one more upgrade to get.  A whole lot of fun.
B00ABO573A|4.0|And yes, there is gay sex and PG nudity, but that's not the \\"adult\\" I reference. Usually gay films for me are a big D. D for dull; D for dreary; D for depressing and disillusioned.<br /><br />With \\"Keep the Lights On\\" I begin to hold some sliver of hope that gay film making and writing may be finally ready to grow up.  In this movie audiences are treated to the life cycle of a gay relationship between 30-something men in Manhattan. The realistic and non-sensational treatment of sexual incompatibility and drug addiction are nicely done. Although clearly dysfunctional, the two main characters were fixtures in each other's life.<br /><br />So refreshing a respite from the inane 20-something chatter played out in a club setting about who's hot and who can sleep with whom next. I wouldn't mind more gay ADULT (in the best meaning of the word) films of this caliber.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I was looking forward to this, but after the first hour my wife gave up and went to read the paper, while i struggled through the next 1.5 hours. This is a long, 2.51 hrs, movie, the plot shifts through time ( which i normally like....but this required a lot of effort to follow.) Hanks is normally a great story teller, but he missed here. There was also alot of darkside to some of the story twists with one notable bathtub suicide that could have been done differently.
B0060CREHO|5.0|great  show for kids and adults......jim  this should be  shown at theatres reviving  my youth dumbo is a great movie from disney
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Read all the reviews, was looking forward to a big picture. Photography is great but plot was incredibly abstract. About 2/3 of the way through i turned it off and never finished the movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is the most believable thing about the whole deal. I have seen the movies about this subject and this book is more believable then them. I think that's why the government did not want it released
B0085YOD1A|5.0|A very nice, accurate way of keeping track of every aspect of your devices status. I like it and highly recommend it. It seems to be easier to get an overall view of the battery energy left plus giving the percentages helps make the status clearer. For free or even a dollar this app is well worth it.
B000URWYTS|2.0|This book was a selection of my neighborhood book club.<br />Basically, it is a supposed to be a fictionalized memoir of a love affair.  It seemed more like a story of 2 totally self-absorbed and narcissistic people who were more impressed with themselves than anyone else was who came into contact with them.  I found them thoroughly despicable, with no shame or humility whatever.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is a tribute to arrogance and selfishness.  I used to think highly of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Now that I know a little more about him, maybe it is justice that fame generally comes to an artist after they are no longer around to bask in it.
B001IWV030|4.0|Great cast very funny movie<br />I had seen this in the theater a long time ago stoic had me laughing
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Hope they continue this series for a lonnngg time.  The characters are interesting and individualized very well. Love it period
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This game is cool but I really wish the game was set up to where if you die in a level and you restart the game it picks up exactly where you left off at so you wouldn't have to start at the beginning of the level all over again because it's frustrating having to start from the beginning of the level when you die and also the controls are a little hard to get used to and this game needs to have some kind of settings
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|To set things straight since the \\"previous\\" Star Trek movie changed things there is now a new generation of Star Trek fans. The new crew is not the same as the old crew as the previous movie clearly altered the universe in an intense way.<br /><br />For the new fans you will love the action and the special effects. The story line serves up some edge of seat portions with the comical and emotional segments you've come to expect. Overall a five star (*****) movie for the new Trekkies.<br /><br />For the old Trekkies, as myself, you may find yourself laughing your butt off as I did. The story was a twisted but tale of old friends. I felt ripped off as I find Hollywood can't continue adventures but rather replay, or rewrite, storied that have been told. The new crew is nothing like the old crew of the Enterprise but that is to be expected from an alternate universe. Kirk was never that wimpy. :-/  For turning the crew inside out I give this only three stars (***).<br /><br />Spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />For references see \\"Space Seed\\": Star Trek original series and \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" movie.
B0092MJOMW|5.0|This album is good all the way though. I have listened to it about 20 times through already. This version contains 2 bonus tracks, not found on the normal release. Good album for sure.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Good for children, good for adults even though it was written so many years ago. The power of your thoughts and the power of your words for good or bad in a timeless tale.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Author created a village of human shortcomings, vices, virtues,and universal social problems that arise therefrom.  I found the English countryside terms charming.  A good story, a good read, redemption, but not all tied up with a pretty bow.  Would recommend.  Hope Rowling continues to write for adults.
037571457X|5.0|In the genre of non-fictional comic/cartoon, this book touches on history and a heart-touching personal story that helps the reader better understand Iran.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is ok but it dose not update you need the same version to do militia players<br />so save your money buy a Apple prosecute
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not very happy with the ending but overall good book... a bit annoyed it doesn't say what book to look forward to next.
B004UID2LC|1.0|showed up as malicious when my virus software scanned my device. I deleted it off my device. no thank you.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Great family movie. We really like watching this movie over and over.  My six year old grandson really likes this movie.
0345529057|5.0|I purchased this set of books for my wife who is a big fan of the HBO series.she is enjoying the books more then the tv show as they cover much more.the books by themselves are 10.95 each but by the box set i was able to get them from amazon for $15.00 a huge savings.the books are great,the price was great so it was a home run all away around
B00AXVIHBU|1.0|I asked for episode 5 but was sold episode 1 which I have already seen.  BULL S***!!!  No instructions on how to get my money refunded three minutes after I ordered it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like it.But the ultra rare dragons are so hard to get.And it is hard to get gold.But I recommend it.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Disney is a greedy company who wants the consumer to pay twice for the release of OZ  I am saying the same thing that other reviewers say about this release its greedy and its not fare so I am not buying this thing just to show these greedy people that we are not falling for this .
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This is a awesome book. It was exciting and sweet. Especially that st Clair character. He always knew what to say to her.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|If you love the movie, this is a good buy. I've listened to it  so many times. It's great to have!
1781162646|5.0|Just a great read! Reminds me of the dime novels of yesteryear! And to all those giving 1-star reviews because it's not in e-reader format, you are missing the point entirely. Did you read anything King has written about why he did it this way? And just because you have an e-reader now, that is the ONLY format you are going to read? Don't be narrow-minded and stubborn. I think King can probably produce a book in any format his little heart desires.
B004GYY714|5.0|I've used both this and iheartradio for a few months. TuneIn is much better at buffering - and very easy to use. I definitely recommend it, especially for talk stations!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Since this is kind of a no brainer to read PDFs I guess you have to have it anyway or at least it is the easiest for most people.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Purchased for the grandchidren who need to see this wonderful family - we try to have Friday Night Movie Night at Grandma's House.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I have only recently acquired this service, and I have been very pleased with the performance of this app.  It is a quick and easy reference for the capacity and remaining life of the battery, and seems to be very accurate.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This movie is amazing!!! I am so happy with this buy! I love having my own copy so I can watch it whenever I like.
B004FOA84A|3.0|First, have to mention that if any of you have played the Nancy Drew games they will understand how much easier this is to play.<br />Based a bit on those mysteries, but not with the complex moving around rooms to investigate, the action and finding of clues is entertaining enough and for the price, quite good.  The fact that it was short, played in less than two hours with a granddaughter, by candlelight and flashlight (power outage)  and the ending was a 'cop-out&#34;, caused me to be disappointed.<br />  However, I am sure that children and preteens will enjoy it, so based on age I think it will work fine for some.  Being a 79 year old<br /> Great Granny (who has played mysteries with grandchildren) might not make me the right person to review this adequately, for those of younger ages.  I guess what I am saying, is the challenge is there for the much younger generations, though not necessarily for teenagers.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A Higher Call is a wonderful account of chivalry and compassion shown during aerial combat, and putting a higher value on human life than on medals and awards.  Very well written, it is hard to put down, and hard to keep a dry eye at times.  It places the reader in the cockpit of both the American B-17 bomber, and German ME-109 fighter - allowing the reader to see the horrors of a brutal air war, through both perspectives.<br /><br />Well done Adam!<br /><br />T. Pederson, USAFR Ret, Kandahar AB, Afghanistan

B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I got hooked after episode one. The cast is amazing and the style of editing and directing unique...very graphic for those who need to know...but visual fx and stunt people are working hard to perfect the show.
B009MO5E10|2.0|I gave it 2 stars for the biking. However, the typical skinny white guy gets the girl and turns out to be the hero is getting pretty old. I shouldn't be able to predict the movie from the first scene, but unfortunately that's what this movie was....predictable. Being a biker myself..I did enjoy the biking scenes. Acting was below average. Watch it once from some one who already owns it; not worth adding to any worthwhile movie collection. Two much better choices are 2 seconds (a great cycling movie), or Red Light Go (if you want to see what being a messenger is all about).
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I've listened to this at least 50 times so far, and enjoy it more every time. The melodies get stuck in my head, but they make me happy. My family and friends are being subjected to it on a daily basis, and they like it too.
B009K86D86|3.0|This movie has a clear bias. However, it does an accurate job of showing the ugly side of food production.  It fails to mention the benefits to the world's growing population. The producers clearly show their disgust with the way animals are treated when their sole purpose is to become food.  I would rather remove myself from this end/spectrum of knowledge but feel there is value in facing facts regardless of the unpleasant truth.  I did not change my eating habits, but then again I raise y own free range chickens.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Didn't find this game fun at all. It is more frustrating than challenging. I'll try it again, but don't think I am going to keep it.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|I ordered it for my five year old grandaughter who plays it over and over  Whole family each has a favorite character.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|With a cast like this how could the movie go wrong.  Film making at its finest, If you like mob type movies this is a must have.
0738737909|5.0|The Tarot Illuminati is the creation of Erik C. Dunne, with a companion book by Kim Huggens.  This Tarot is based on the Rider Waite Smith (RWS) Tradition and it depicts the same imagery on the artist unique style.  Paraphrasing from Steele's preface, this deck is not about secret societies, but about the Light of Wisdom shown by the inpired vision of Dunne.  As such, this deck is better serve for Tarot collectors than beginners, since the imagery may be too vibrant and complicated at times.<br /><br />I must admit I was reluctant to buy this deck at first since I have no appetite for gilded decks or another re-imaging of the RWS.  However, a review in youtube picked my interest on this deck.<br /><br />Holding these cards on my own hands is another experience altogether.  Dunne's artistic style is basically a realistic representation of the RWS Tarot using a collage of images merged with a computer software.  However, this description oversimplifies what Dunne has created.  It would be better to describe my experience with these cards as a sensory overload waiting to happen.  The imagery is so vibrant at times; almost overwhelming to the point that I didn't know what to focus on first.  For some of the cards, this effect is too distracting, but for most of them it works on demanding a closer attention to the imagery.<br /><br />The cards in this deck are gilded on the edge.  These are 4.75\\" x 2.75\\", slightly wider than the usual 4.75\\" x 2.5\\" for LoScarabeo, but matching the size of The Rider Tarot from U.S. Games Systems.  These are also thicker (1 3/8\\") than other LoScarabeo decks (1\\").  The images on these cards are edge to edge, with the exception of a 0.25\\" at the bottom for the card's label title. Otherwise, these cards are effectively borderless.  The back of these cards are reversible, showing a golden decorations on a green emerald background.<br /><br />The Tarot Illuminati cards are numbered and labeled at the bottom.  The Major Arcana are numbered with roman numerals starting at 0 with the Fool and labeled on the Rider Waite Smith Tradition with the exception of I. The Alchemist (The Magician) and X. The Wheel (The Wheel of Fortune).<br /><br />In the Minor Arcana, the pips are numbered Ace to 10, while the court cards are labeled Princess, Prince, Queen and King.  Each suite in the Minor Arcana is associated with a world culture: Cups with Venetian/Italian Culture, Pentacles with Oriental Culture, Wands with Perisan/Arabian Culture, Swords with Elizabethan/English Culture.  However, the guidebook associate the Cups with a \\"Fantasy Culture\\".  I disagree.<br /><br />These cards come in a kit. The box is decorated with golden highlights all around on a green emerald background, with The High Priestess on the front.  If you settle the ornate box on its back, it opens like a coffer and closes with a magnetic contact. This kit also includes a guidebook decorated in the same fashion as the box, with The High Priestess on the front and The Prince of Cups on the back.  This book is organized as follows:<br /><br />Foreword -  In the foreword, Pamela Steele tells how she discovered Erik C. Dune's artwork and how the Tarot Illuminati comes to be.<br /><br />Introduction - The introduction is barely three pages long!  It focus on the purpose of the Tarot Illuminati and what is different from the rest.<br /><br />Using The Tarot Illuminati - This section includes four spreads:  The Sun, Moon and Star Spread (3 cards), The Planetary Spread (7 cards), The Lighting the Lantern Spread (6 cards), The Rising Sun Spread (4 cards),<br /><br />How to Learn Tarot - This brief section (four pages long) includes a few hints when using the Tarot including: keeping a journal, daily draw, and interpreting the cards.<br /><br />Major Arcana - Subtitled Emanations of the Light, this section starts with the association of the Major Arcana to the ten planets (With Sun, Moon and Pluto minus Earth) and the twelves sings of the Zodiac. This sectioncontinues with the description of each Major Arcana in two pages including a Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts in a Page and a Color Picture in the following.<br /><br />Minor Arcana - Subtitled Illuminating the Mundane, this section refers only to the Pips in the Minor Arcana.  It starts with the association of the Minor Arcana to the four elements and the numbers. This section continues with the description of each Pip Card in a single page including a Quarter-page Color Picture, Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts.<br /><br />Court Cards - Subtitled Stars on Earth, this section starts with the association of the Court Cards to the four elements. This section continues with the description of each Court Card in a single page including a Quarter-page Color Picture, Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts.<br /><br />Appendix - Subtitled Tarot Illuminati Revealed, includes an excerpt from the e-book \\"Tarot Illuminati Revealed\\" describing The High Priestess in full detail.  It sure make you want to buy the e-book.<br /><br />This deck is a realistic representation of the RWS Tarot, but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners because it may be overwhelming at times.  However, it is indeed an interesting re-imaging of the RWS Tarot, one that Tarot collector must not let pass.continues with the description of each Major Arcana in two pages including a Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts in a Page and a Color Picture in the following.<br /><br />Minor Arcana - Subtitled Illuminating the Mundane, this section refers only to the Pips in the Minor Arcana.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|To think that we were given an inside look at what happens to us in a trauma by a nuerosurgeon was amazing.  I thought his description of heaven a bit much! But who's to argue with what someone saw as heaven when you won't be able to tell people when you get there...  Very interesting and a good read.
B00BGI076M|4.0|In my opinion Kevin Bacon is a terrific actor, as is his wife. He can portray both sides of good/evil very effectively and his being in a movie or series entices me to watch it. The Following was no exception and I did try to stay with it for 5 episodes, however it is way too dark for me. I don't really enjoy watching movies or series about psychopathic serial killers; I'd rather see a scary creature movie (less reality since I don't expect to encounter those types of monsters in daily life). Even still, I was reluctant to stop watching because of the quality of the show and the actors.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Easy read. . . Finished it in one sitting.  It was great that the author added more information about the political climate in Illea.  I'm anxiously awaiting the next book to find out if America is THE ONE!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Go for it. Splurge and have hours of fun for only .99 cent.  The family competition is who can get the highest score.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Growing up, I saw the movie every year (and own several versions) but had never read the book! And I am very glad I did. What a beautiful story and not just for Christmas or the holidays.
B00A3T5CGU|3.0|When you first start the app, you need to wait a while to download a map of the entire country (or if you're in the US/Canada, the whole state) after that, the interface won't work.  You might have to download all the maps again, but eventually, it will start working.<br /><br />Compared to, say, google navigator, it has a few disadvantages: the OpenStreetMap data it uses contained inacuracies that sometimes gave me impossible routes.  Furthermore, the routing algorithm didn't adequately factor the speed of many roads into determining the best route.  Furthermore, the interface, while intuitive enough to use, has a bunch of unnecessary screens and it takes more time than it should to input your destination.<br /><br />However, it's not all bad: this maps that are saved on your phone will be there without an internet connection, so all you need is GPS.  Also, most of the roads in the maps are generally accurate, and since the data is open, you can submit changes if there are problems. (I did.)  And finally, this app is not controlled by a giant company whose business is to track you and target ads at you.
0142421375|4.0|Theodore Boone is one cool cat.  Virtually as soon as his girlfriend mysteriously disappears from her house in the middle of the night, he is planning her rescue.  No tears,no tantrums, just serious-minded level headedness is displayed to all and sundry in his determined way to see her back safe and sound.  The usual characters return and the story flows more smoothly than book one.  More community characters are introduced to the reader by Mr Grisham and they add to the depth of story telling no end.  The plot itself is more interesting and entertaining and even slightly more mature also.  The ending is a trifle easy and obvious but I am not eight years old.<br /><br />A solidly entertaining book for Mr Grisham's younger readers to enjoy.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!
0764169742|5.0|Love this book the pics are beautiful and is very informative, simple to understand, as far as what it pertains too. Would buy again and also recommend as well.
0316044695|2.0|Trying to read this book (hardback) for the second time, and I'm struck by how even worse it seems, six years after it was first published. My complaint is not with the author's service to his country in the military, but rather, the absolutely lousy book he produced to chronicle it. Three principal problems:<br /><br />1) overwhelming and smothering radical right-wing political agenda, especially w/ respect to US foreign policy (reads like a primer justifying US neo-imperialism and speaks glowingly of the \\"success\\" of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the wonderfulness of US counter-terror policies and actions) - blaming the \\"liberal media\\" was a strawman too far, btw;<br /><br />2) banal, boring prose;<br /><br />3) inconsistencies in logic/reasoning, at least as reflected by the tortured prose (\\"he was cruel...there wasn't a mean bone in his body\\" - paraphrasing); factual errors & outright fabrications...<br /><br />And that's after only 128 pages.<br /><br />If I'd paid any more than a few dollars for this book, I'd have felt ripped-off.<br /><br />UPDATED (JAN'14): Following my second disappointing experience with this book, I researched Luttrell's story independently, and learned that Marcus contributed very little to the actual writing and that Robinson bears most of the responsibility for the major factual errors, the tortured prose, and the dubious claims/fabrications...although Luttrell was roundly criticized by Lt. Murphy's father. And the jingoism is an accurate reflection of Luttrell's world view.<br /><br />That this book is FUBAR should dissuade the US military from hastily endorsing a rush-job to tell the story of our armed forces' next heroes. While the movie is more refined, \\"Lone Survivor\\" book is a disaster.<br /><br />If you buy this book and like it, good for you, but I don't think that any serious student of military history and memoirs who has high expectations for the quality of work they consume will be satisfied w/ \\"Lone Survivor.\\"\\"
B008NQYWC0|5.0|This book is phenomenal!  Stephen King's latest triumph is a gripping, thrilling, love story.  .An absolute page-turner, I could not, would not, and did not put it down until I got to the end.  Every page is a true masterpiece of suspense, humor, and expert wordplay.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The story picks up immediately with more surprises and excitement.  Cannot put it down. No spoilers on this review - READ IT
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Did not want to spend extra on Blu-ray, so we ordered this one.  Since it is a new movie, the visual difference is negligible.  Be aware that packaging is different........it is a &#34;paper sleeve&#34; type of DVD.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|No. Really. GO READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Wow. Excellent narration from so many different points of view. Great, unique choices for quotes at the beginning of each part. Just a really good read.<br /><br />Now GO READ THIS BOOK!
0345525558|5.0|Well-written; totally absorbing.  I could not put it down.  The characters are all well-drawn and totally believable.  Story is truly heart-wrenching at times.  The ending is perhaps a little too pat, but overall I highly recommend the book.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Classic Schwarzenegger.  Even though there was a lot of blood, guts and destruction, his classic humor popped up throughout the movie.  It's good to see him back in the movie business.  Absolutely great entertainment!  And, from one almost 66'er to another... GO ARNOLD!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I honestly have never watched any series, except this one. Everyone raved about it so I thought I'd take a look. I'm glad I did - it's great!
B0000636NQ|5.0|The first Guitar Shredder, and Live is where he is best. The world is missing agreat Guitar Player, and by testimonials by those Closest to him; an even greater person. This was a great line up of musicians, as Ric Lee, Chick Churchill, and Leo Lyons are good musicians in their own light. But to have the true Ten Years After, you need Alvin.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|The twist needs to be much more of a twist.<br /><br />I would recommend watching a classic Hitchcock instead.  Or wait until this movie has been out long enough that you can rent it for a reduced price or that it is included with Amazon Prime.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|I bought this album after seeing Searching for Sugarman and seeing him in concert recently.<br />I am enjoying it very much!
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Not an easy read, challenging to follow and a bit slow. There are better novels to enjoy.  Not what I was hoping.
0425263924|4.0|Now of course there has to be more so we know what happens to them. One more book should do it, Please don't stretch it out, this coulda been the last one, but it seemed a little stretched out, Love the storyline, but now we all have to wait for the next one. I like to order all of a trilogy together so I can read them one after another as in between waiting for this one, I read several other books, and had to catch up on the second one before starting the third , so I hope we don't have to wait for the fourth for too long. or the fifth if that is the case....great books though, great story and I recommend them highly, love Sylvia day books
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|well written book that gave interesting insight into someone who suffers with cancer, especially a child. I would recommend this to  teenagers as well as adults.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Your kids will like this movie, but this movie was made for us children of the 70s/80s/90s that grew up on NES and went to college with our Xboxes.<br /><br />It is clever, sweet, and suspenseful;  an all around terrific movie.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful and engaging.  Look forward to seeing a 2nd time.  If possible, see on a big screen.  That is my only regret.
B001TCHDPS|2.0|After listening to Cold Fact, I was disappointed with the songs on this CD.<br />I would just stick with Cold Fact.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I like this movie, great suspense, Some of the movie line I was not suspecting but most I did after seeing the alien ship, still a good movie.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Love it, great texting app for kindles and other tablet or any devise.<br />Works very well,  It's sends and retrieve the messages fast.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am normally not a review writer, and unfortunately I pre-ordered this book, expecting what was described at the end of the third book, and was not privy to the poor reviews before I started it the day it came out! I have loved this series so far more than 50 Shades simply because the writing was far better, the character development and interactions have always been beautifully described and Day never fails to provide steamy edge of your seat scenes, but this time Day severely disappointed me.  She seems to have gone round and round about nothing, repeating Eva's inner termoil and lust for Gideon over and over, while barely skimming the surface of wrapping up any of the openended issues left in the last book.  I was under the impression that this was supposed to be the final book in the series, suprise, it is not, she has just dragged us along and resolved very little for us. The begnning provides reminders of where we she left us previously, the middle 3/4s of the book is mostly filler, providing us with severely underdeveloped resolution of some issues between the characters...Eva's dad comes to town after finding out about her abuse, stays three days spends one evening with Eva, screws her mom, and leaves...and this somehow resolves his issue with her abuse??? Day then attempts to tie up some loose ends by marrying Gideon and Eva after what barely a month since their break up?? and create new issues in the last 10 percent of the book without ever fully resolving what I think we were all waiting for...Gideon's abuse and dreams!!  Prior to reading Entwined with You I wanted this series to go on forever even at 9.99 each, now wish I she had just finished it!  I think we will likely find that the final two books (at least I'm hoping the next ends this series) could have been combined in to one fabulous book!
B0018OFN2W|3.0|I feel bad saying this, but this is one of those movies where I derive entertainment from watching the movie fail. The plot works, but it is really stupid and full of wholes. The only character moments are between the two supposedly heterosexual leads and how they each hate it when the other hits on females, and that is always hilarious to watch. The CGI is AWFUL and makes the action scenes that don't feature real cars feel absolutely surreal. The rest of the characters are one dimensional stereotypes full of hip-hop bravado and sexist stupidity. This movie is not good, but it is entertaining. Worth a rental, not worth a buy.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I read this after just completing A thousand Suns.  A novel I thoroughly enjoyed.  But I found this book hard to get through especially the last half. There are many sub plots and characters. Some that go no where and you are left up in the air a bit. The story rambles on a bit and there is a lot of padding. It lacks the emotional depth that A thousand Suns had and I found myself wondering how much further I had to go to get to the end.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the writer is very talented at painting a scene. I am told the kite runner is very good and that is my next challenge. I hope it does not disappoint as well
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Could not find interest in the beginning but held on.  It then hit and was another good story.  Child writes these stories well.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked this movie, great action, suspenseful up to a point. Its not one I would consider a keeper, but it is in my library of movies.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I've read hundreds  and hundreds of romance books - some good, some not so much. But I have never been so irritated that I felt a review was necessary. First of all, I expected an ending but was left hanging. Doesn't a trilogy means three??? But not here, I guess... I feel so disappointed and let down too. Eva is very unattractive in the slutty way she behaves. What kind of a woman CRAZY IN LOVE behaves that way anyway??? Apparently Eva!!! I kept wondering if would've been the other way around what Eva would've felt and done. And the passive way Gideon took it everything??? Come on!! Isn't he possessive???<br />Fried and done with Crossfire but lets call it A Series now because apparently the money is too good to let it end like it was suppose to!!!<br />This book was just about SEX, SEX, and more SEX! Ugh! No story at all!!! It doesn't even have a plot!!!! Only,<br />\\"I love you.\\" \\"I love you more.\\" \\"But I love you\\" \\"Man I really love you.\\" \\"Lets have sex ten times in a row.\\" \\"Did I mention that I love you?\\" \\"I need you.\\" \\"I need you so much.\\" \\"oh God, right there Gideon. yeah! Oh I love you so much.\\" \\"Really? I love you too!\\" Time for sex again because.... I really love you.\\" Boring, boring, boring....
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is so cute and really addictive. The controls are so simple and the levels are quick. And you really can't beat the price. I mean $.99 for a great game when other horrible games are $4.99. This is definitely one to buy both kids and adults will enjoy this one. Excellent!
B002NNA9N0|4.0|Stellar cast with performances that reinforce that confirm it.  Not an easy movie to watch though a fascinating look into the seamy side of life.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|i thought it was the unlimited version, this one makes you less creative when creating new things/persons. The real reason i bought was 'cause pewdiepie and smash played it and it seemed amazing!
B00CVE1SAO|4.0|Difficult to put down. I began reading early one morning and stayed with it until late in the afternoon. An easy read that is very well written
B00B4804KS|3.0|I know the movie very well and love it. But for 3D I was totally disappointed and wished I had saved my money.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|Although I enjoy science fiction movies, and Will Smith happens to be one of my favorite actors, I felt like this movie had room for improvement. The acting was Good, along with the message it presented to its viewers. Sound Effects and Visual was also good. However, something was lacking, and even Will Smith is not too happy with this movie, according to his recent interview. The movie had Good intentions, but it certainly was not like watching \\"INDEPENDENCE DAY\\" or \\"MEN IN BLACK.\\" The story could have been more dramatic with additional action, and entertainment. If Will Smith is in a movie, I will watch it, but reality is, I found this one to be disappointing. It isn't as mysterious and powerful as many science fiction movies are, but I did enjoy the role of Will Smith's performance, and what the story portrayed. Overall, it isn't the worst science fiction movie I have viewed, and it isn't one of my favorites.<br /><br />--Geraldine Ahearn(Author Geri Ahearn)
B002C949KE|4.0|The author does a nice job of laying out very interesting examples that certainly resonate with my personal experience. I didn't have to think very hard to recollect many examples that fit exactly with the points being made in the book. As with most of these sorts of books the most interesting and engaging material is at the beginning and as you work your way through the chapters the material gets a little more esoteric, the examples get a bit thinner, and the connections with every day experiences get more and more tenuous. So while I found it very engaging and interesting at the beginning, I finished it because--dang it--I finish books that I start!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The best thing about this movie is the name.  We turned it off 3/4 of the way through because it was so bad.  The music, video, acting and story were all horrible.  Not even worth watching for free.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hi I just wanted to say this game is SO COOL it just isn't fun when you lose but I guess every game is like that.I think you should totaly get this game NOW like A.S.A.P. hope you enjoy. :)
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love these kind of games. This one is so Challenging. Pay the money you won't be disappointed.There is a lot of levels to play.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I Loved Willow and was thrilled to see it finally offered on DVD. I bought this one for my daughter-in-law because this was her favorite movie as a teen. She and my son even named their daughter &#34;Elora&#34; after the princess. Great movie!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This fills the JP: Operation Genesis shaped hole in my soul.<br /><br />I only subtracted a star from a full five because of a few paleontological inaccuracies in the appearances of a few dinosaurs (yes, I'm that sort of person).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BOOK!! It had many heartfelt moments and very graphic descriptions of the war being fought. I couldn't stop reading but didn't want it to end.
B004661J04|4.0|Seven Was a great movie, we enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a suspense thriller movie
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I liked this movie! The performances were refreshing and the scenery relaxing. Julianne and Josh brought (happily) surprising honesty and depth to these characters.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love all the characters.  will miss them when done with Season Three.  Hope there's going to be a Fourth Season.
1567184855|5.0|I loved this book. About 4 times I found parts that kind of made my hair stand up as I thought, &#34;I already knew this in the back of my mind, and now I'm reading about it.&#34; Very cool.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Yet again John LeCarre chooses a topic for our times and fills his book with memorable characters, both likeable and unlikeable,
B001UU75WK|5.0|I didn't watch the series on TV (too busy), but love watching movies at my leisure. So having seen a few repeat episodes, I saw the pilot on Amazon. WOW! I was hooked. I watched the entire series after that... every episode... and was sad although satisfied at its conclusion. If you enjoy mystery, SciFi, and adventure, GET IT! You'll love it, too!
1475143389|5.0|I have been working out and running for years with moderate success.  After initial gains frustration would set in as progress slowed.  Michael successfully analyzes what actions are necessary to get bigger, leaner and stronger in his book.  It is not as complicated as others make it.  Michael dispels the myths and misconceptions of body building and gives the reader a workable plan  In addition, he truly wants you to find success and follows up individually to help you in any way he can.  That is extraordinary!  Bill
B0086DBE62|2.0|I liked some of the costumes. And I love Julia Roberts, generally. But she was too stilted in this. Boring!
B00821OW8K|1.0|Why when I read most amazon movie reviews by intelligent reviewers they have no clue how movies or shows are made? bla bla bla the plot, the drama, the acting. Well this review will be quick because  it is bad for its music, sound, and camera work, nuff said. nothing worse than over the top music that does not relate to the scene. It's just there to fill, competing with chessy sound effects. this just ruins it for me. Turned if off. Maybe It gets better I don't care now. The first show must pull you in like it did for me with GOT.
B005VPRETE|5.0|will purchase similar again the grand children really like them the selection is great and we will be back for more
B002JVWRAY|5.0|got it for my husband as a present it arrived right on time good condition no complaints here, hew was happy with his gift
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This was a movie that really delivered where it comes to a new plot line and great special effects. I gave it only a four star-rating because it was a little confusing, which pulled my attention away from being completely absorbed in the plot. Still, I rented it first and then purchased it because it fits well into my personal library of \\"different\\" movies. Enjoy!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Scary and well acted. I also love that it flashes back to the History of the various characters. I'm looking forward to watching season 2
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My 6 year old son loves this movie and I found it very fun to watch as well. it is one of our newer favorite movies.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I began the book and quickly realized it did not grab my attention as quickly as Bared or Reflected.  I thought that perhaps it was because I had just wrapped up reading another series from a different author.  However, after only reading 20% of the book I realized that the problem was not me... but the book.  And reading many of the reviews I also realized that I am not the only one who is quite disappointed with the author.  I have never returned a Kindle book (even free ones!!) until this one and a big Thank You to the individual who posted instructions on how to do so.
0679847367|5.0|I have given and read aloud this book to both of my children that have graduated from high school. I love it
B0057URWSQ|3.0|I read all these great comments about \\"Suits\\" and figure it must be a great show that I need to start watching. About halfway through the first episode, I almost turn it off. It is not very realistic. It's really not that clever. It's nothing more than an entertaining way to spend 45 minutes. But, I continue on. Make it through the second episode feeling pretty much the same way I did through the first. Partially through the third episode and I'm just not impressed. It's an okay show about a law firm. It's not BAD. I just can't believe so many people are so easy to give five stars to something not that original or not better than all the other ordinary shows out there. I seriously doubt I'll even make it to the fourth episode. Maybe season two is mind blowing and I need to skip ahead.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Die Trying would've made a better movie over One Shot.  A great read--very suspenseful.  Though, not as violent as book No. 1 The Killing Floor, Die Trying keeps you on the edge needing to find out what happens next. I really hope this becomes Lee Child's next movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a post apocalyptic setting the continent of north america is now known as panem and is divided into 13 districts and has a special purpose the are like slaves to the capitol once known as the rockies
B004LWZW88|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed watching this movie, especially my 6 year old. Very entertaining and fun, with some adult humor thrown in.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, relaxing, fun and no killing etc. I enjoy Jennifer Lopez's movies.<br />Just a fun movie to watch.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game itself is really great but when apple devices get it before kindle fires its kind of frustrating to not be able to get it at the same time.
B008602KQI|5.0|Starts a tad slow, but then becomes a steamroller. Just hope the future is not like that. Though hope is shown to exist.
B000XSEPYQ|1.0|What was Benjamin Linus thinking?<br /><br />I just watched the whole thing. Half an hour in, I thought it had potential. An hour in I knew it was bad. By the end I just wanted the horrible acting and story to be over so I could write this review. Dr Lawrence is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. Not that he had a great script or great directing to work with - both were abysmal failures - but to say he should never be seen on film again is an understatement. He was god awful. A plot hole in a movie always sucks. But when the premise becomes so unbelievable (people responding to situations like it was opposite day), then patience wears thin. Not even the amateurish \\"plot twist\\" at the end could save this stinker.<br /><br />F
0316010669|4.0|The book was extremely enlightening.  I would recommend it to anyone. The book was very thought provoking.  It was very well written.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is a master. This book and many others that he has written should be requires reading in schools.<br /><br />Weaving historical facts with fiction creates compelling drama and a way to understand and enjoy history.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|it was aaahhhhhh... okay I wouldent really prefer getting this app expessily if it costs you money it was really dumb and boring.....don't download it.....
B0097EWK3A|5.0|An enjoyable game that is hard enough to make you think, but not so hard that it is not fun.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Good Omens is the first book I've read by either Neil Gaiman or Terry Prachett, though I have heard the work of both of them raved about for years.  I was not disappointed at all.  It passed my foolproof litmus test for a great book: It kept me up way past my bedtime night after night.<br /><br />I'm not going to retell the whole plot, since I detest reviews that do that.  Let's just say that this is a very offbeat story about a somewhat froofy angel, a slick but likable devil, a kindhearted antichrist (aged 11), a reluctant witchhunter with a lousy car, and a number of other very memorable characters, as they face the long-expected end of the world.  I laughed out loud in almost every chapter of this book, and was genuinely sad to see it end.  You can bet that I'll be looking up many more titles by both Gaiman and Prachett very soon.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I think the language was right on (pirates, slave English).  If you<br />liked the Matrix's plot & theme mixed with 1984, then you will love<br />the movie. Otherwise, you will not like this movie. I give t 4.3 out<br /> of 5.0  Thomas Bergersen (Two steps from hell)composed the best music<br /> for this movie. It suits it well his album (illusions, song Sonera)<br />is played throughout the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Entwined with you picks up right where Reflected in you leaves off. This book concentrated more on the relationship of Gideon and Eva. Overcoming their pasts which are thrown into their present. I truly enjoyed the banter between Gideon and Eva, it showed a more playful side of Mr. Dark and Dangerous. Their relationship has been broken and they are trying to see if all of the pieces can be repaired.<br /><br />\\"There wasn't a second that passed when you weren't on my mind. You own me Eva, Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing. I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing what Sylvia Day has coming for Angel & Ace!
0985081821|5.0|This is a great read. Hamilton does a fantastic job making the main character, Sophia, both tough and vulnerable. At the beginning of the book, Sophia has problems. She has voices in her head, a crazy cult lady trying to push her out of her home, and a mother who has gone off her meds. Then her best friend Ivory takes her to a club, and things start to happen very fast. Before Sophia knows it, she's involved in a world she never dreamed existed. A world that is very dangerous. Sophia is traveling down two paths; one path to find out the answer to her voices and her past, and the other to survive in the new world she's found herself in. And she's about to find that the two are more closely connected then she could have imagined
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow it is not bad I love this. But in servile craft it has more things and stuff I would get it
B006XIR9KM|2.0|the game was ok. addicting at first but gets old fast. worked well and didnt crash my phone which was a evo sprint
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Told in a very real way.  She did an amazing job telling her story.  What a horrible experience to live through.
B004I654WQ|5.0|I waited for blu-ray and finally got it. excellent movie. My kids enjoyed the movie and watching it again and again.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This is only one example of why Amazon won't be this industry's leader. If you want to play with the big boys Amazon, you got to play in the sandbox. Really considering a iAnything for the next purchase for this very reason, come on!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love the guide, and fun to play.  only thing I don't like is the pop up ads, other tha that quite fun to play.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This arrived in used condition at a good price.  Since my husband and I love country music we thought we would like this movie; however it contains drug related issues, and we didn't like it as much as we thought we would.  However, it played well as used and was sent in a timely manner, so I won't detract from the seller.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|love this whole cd. i got it after seeing the movie and it is a great cd to listen to its up beat great to work out to
193700788X|5.0|Loved this series of books, from the first, to the last, as well as the ending of the story. Well worth the read
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|Lovely scenic scenes of Venice, Rome, the Amalfi Coast (Positano).<br />The Italian country side is a beautiful place to be stranded.<br />The acting is a treat, you will love it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|It is a very fun exciting puzzler. It has good sound as well. Refering to the character sounds and music as well.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This was an amazing book! I absolutely loved the entire series and was very surprised by how well the series was done!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Omg this series is the best on tv. I'm so glad I watched the first 3 seasons. I can't wait for the show to start again.
B000FA675C|5.0|a favorite for sure, just had to have it on my kindle, its nice to be able to read anytime i want !!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sorry to hear this is to be the last of the series.  All good things must come to an end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was very interesting to read, the description of the characters and areas made you really see everything. Can't wait to see how things look in the movie when it comes out. I just bought the next book in the series, anxious to see what happens next.
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|My 12 yo children watched the movie and found it very funny and entertaining.  Appropriate for pre teens , it is a good family movie.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|it was an amazing book, I felt like it fell off a bit at the end. Overall was a great read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The tools and audio that go with this application are the best I have used. Sensible simple and attainable.<br />Thank you.
B00328R21C|5.0|Awesome! My favorite characters! The land speeder is really cool! I still gave it 5 stars but I have 1 complaint it says there is a place for them to hide their light sabers I couldn't find it but still a happy customer 5 stars!
B000N90JGI|4.0|I love Matthew hes a good actor and he's funny! Did great job with his role and Jen is good to, used to love her but I lost some of my respect to her when she turn around and have a relationship with this young kid!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very fast reading and really kept my interest. I am sad there are no more books in the series.
1892005034|5.0|A lot of what is in this book is common sense, but then common sense usually works. My parents teach a course in this, and a friend recommended this book to me. It's a surprising look at how other people can &#34;take&#34; what you consider to be ordinary communication in the wrong way--and see it as violent. Like a lot of written material in 12-step and other similar materials, this book offers ways to communicate in non-violent ways. May feel artificial as first, but as with all materials, take what you like and leave the rest ... it IS effective if you use what feels natural to you. At least that is my experience with it using this with my close relatives.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I love this cover because I don't have to hold the book in my hands for long periods. Thanks  a lot.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It's quite fun and the music and animations sucked in the kids right away.  One of the best free apps of the day in months.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is  major Star!!! And she proves it in the this live concert. If you are a Sade fan you will love this dvd!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I find this application quite useful. However, it would be really great to be able to use my Android device to view Amazon Instant video and would most likely by videos, if this was available.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This game is not even worth 99&cent; it is crapy, glitchy,and Doesn't last long, the graphics are bad and I seen games that gameloft created for 99&cent; and their so much better Don't by this game but buy modern combat 4 it's also by gameloft and it is way better
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I read this after reading Born to Run and it filled in a lot about nutrition and long distance running. It's also a great story. I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why is there no update is it going to be out on the kindle fire,I really hope it's on hier.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I generally don't watch many movies that don't involve swords or guns, but made an exception.  This movie does a wonderful job of dealing with the issue of mental illness.  Seeing Bradley Cooper in a less than gorgeous role was a bit of a twist but it in a way highlights the way we sometimes can view people with mental illness though a filter that makes them look less appealing. Dealing with people who have mental illness can be a huge challenge and I think this movie shows a little of that while also showing just how human all of us are at the core.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I think this game should be $5 this game is the best game I played in a year awesome also better then batman and spider man and better then AVP and more
B003L77GGK|5.0|The best Season by far. Whoever has seen the previous ones must see the sixth season. Check it out, but not before seeing the first ones.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I loved the first weaphones armory and this is just like, but with a different theme. New guns from an awesome period in warfare. I hope, like the first, that more updates come with more guns.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have to say I am REALLY disappointed in this series esp. that there is another one now. I had to reread the 1st two in order to catch back up & then I get into the 3rd one & was like what happened to this book. It was the same thing over & over again, they fight, they have sex, they fight & more sex. I felt the whole story line was missing, I LOVE Eva & Gideon but I am sad to say that I don't think I'll be reading the 4th one esp if it takes another 8 mos like this one did which I believe is why I didn't enjoy this one at all.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I own all of Joe's albums.  My favorites are Flying in a Blue Dream and Crystal Planet.  Although I find goodness in them all, some of the recent albums don't get same drive time play as the classics did.  This one absolutely will!  The new musicians on the album take the songs to a different place than Joe has gone before.  Vinnie Colaiuta is an amazing drummer.  He really brings a fresh feel and groove to these songs.  Well done Joe and Co!
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I found this movie to be a mixed blend. In the first act, the movie failed to interest me.  It was if I was being offered a quiet meal of cheese puffs.  The music, direction, edits, etc. seemed second rate and not on par with the franchise.<br /><br />The second and third acts however are action-packed and spectacular.  The initial disconnected start was patched with detail and human-bonding.  John McClane's hearty resolve returns with grit and humor.<br /><br />I am sure that I'll enjoy the continued production of Die Hard movies as Jack, John's son, has taken the helm and promises the continuation of the heroic lone lawman series.
B00321GTJU|5.0|This is the best adventure through the various habitats on our planet. PERIOD. It was beyond fascinating and the footage is incredible.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|LOVED this movie! Cleverly written and orchestrated in such a away that you almost root for the bad guys because they're a bit um...slow...but hella hilarious and well...Kuzco's kind of a hmm...lemme keep it PG: he's kind of a donkey!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva fantastic story I'm so glad it's not over yet.l love reading true love stories like this it makes me believe in the impossible. Please say we don't have long to wait for the next book!!!!!!!!
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|It leaves off where the last one ended.  Out of this series, the first one is still the best.  This one is over the top like the last one with lots of  crazy things and excellent action.  However, it is boring at times because unlike the first one, there is no basis in reality.  Myth Busters could do two whole shows just on the myths in this one movie.  And there it is.  If you look at it like a video game with unlimited ammo and things happening that could never happening and no laws of physics, it's a 3 maybe 4 star rating.  If you would like any reality in your movie, it's more one star.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is such an awesome CD by the Peppers. It's an older album but I can still listen to it straight through.
B004QL7K8E|5.0|I laughed a great deal while watching this movie.  I enjoyed the honest portrayal of three coming-of-age teens, and the movie's party spirit.  I also enjoyed the irony and scale of the epic party.<br /><br />The steady documentary-style filming worked well with the storyline & cinematography.<br /><br />The acting was realistic and the extras had plentiful glee and zeal.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this bingo game best to play! The graphics are wonderful and it is paced great. The only thing I do not like is that without knowing it...you lose tickets if you choose the &#34;after bingo&#34; option to win another bingo. Since tickets are what we pay for...I lost a lot of tickets because I was unaware of how they are used. I really like the last chance to win a bingo...but didn't realize till too late, that I was losing tickets when I chose this option. Otherwise, best bingo game!
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I Love sound cloud could help but love the app. It's perfect to have sound cloud on the go! :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i loved this book. I was a little worried when I chose it, because the 2 people I am closest to are terminally ill.  But, the book is touching, insightful and funny.  It made me laugh and cry.  It is not an intentional tear-jerker and it has some unpredictable moments.  It's a wonderful book for young adults and all adults. I look forward to reading John Green's other books.
B005544V6A|5.0|I can''t wait to watch Season 2 and 3 and 4, in other words I  hope they never cancel the series.
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|I love reading this news on my kindle. But it &quot;stops&quot; a lot and sometimes I have to remove it from my kindle fire HD completely and redownload it to get it to work.  I try shutting off the kindle, I tried forcing it to stop and clearing the cache, and nothing solves the problem.  It will work for awhile but always goes bad.  I keep dealing with it though because I like the app so much better than going online.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I enjoy this game. I wish it was easier to friend others in the network. Give it a try! Thanks
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like this game a lot and play it daily! There is nothing really bad to say about it. It can be addictive and I enjoy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get this app it is awesome it change every month it was at china in may now its at Miami it has very good animation details
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book. I saw the first movie and was hopeful the book would be good. Little did I know there was a trilogy! Great what if it wasn't good? No need to worry about that. The character development is amazing. The 'games' themselves are in such detail and fantasy; yet if you close your eyes the images are played out before you. The author is brilliant. I will be looking for other books written by Suzanne Collins.
B003AKLFAG|1.0|One of the worst movie ever. Poor acting, poor plot, weak characters, poor everything. Hard to do worst. Why did it get so many positive review will now be for me one of the big mysteries of life. I guess that if you are from a culture that likes to have &#34;soap opera like&#34; acting in movies, and loves exaggerated drama everywhere like Koreans do, you might think it's not sooo bad.<br />Otherwise, save your time, life is short.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD THIS CD HAS ALOT OF AWSOME SONGS AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT I GOT TO BUY THIS ITEM THANK YOU
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Acting was kinda lame, not a whole lot of action. With such good stars in this movie, i was expecting more.

B008B1BL4E|3.0|Unlike most books on the origins of WWI, this effort brings into sharp focus Austro-Hungarian relations with Russia, Serbia, and the other Balkan states as important factors in the origins of the war.  In this approach, Clark expands the usual cast of characters to Izvolsky in Paris, the German envoy Hartwig in Belgrade, Paleologue in St. Petersburg, and Pasic, the Serbian Prime Minister.  Clark's review of the arcane aspects of Balkan history between 1903 and 1914 is worth the Kindle price of the book.  In what other history of the origins of WWI will you find the Austro-Serbian Pig War, the internal politics of pre-war Serbia, or a discussion of the historical importance of Kosovo?  There is also a concise analysis of Sir Edward Grey's career and role in the crisis that brings Grey out of the shadows, or at least into a less dim light.<br /><br />Clark ably supports his thesis that determining factors in how the crisis progressed to its conclusion are the Entente powers' presumption that Austria-Hungary was not entitled to expect redress from Serbia appropriate to Serbia's continuing role of provocateur in Austro-Serbian and inter-Balkan relations, and Serbia's complicity in the planning and facilitation of Franz Ferdinand's assassination.<br /><br />Like AJP Taylor, Clark is not embarrassed to ascribe to his cast of characters internal motivations, thoughts, and actions that go far beyond the source material.<br /><br />Complexity of the Clark's approach to the origins of the War requires better organization of material and interim summaries.  Clark also has a habit of inventing words as shortcuts to clarity of prose----two of my favorites are \\"bellicism\\"---where did that come from?  Another is \\"disinhabituation\\".  Try getting those two past your spell checker.<br /><br />Overall an interesting, but turgid approach.  Shot the editor?
1904633005|4.0|I had expected a standard sized book, but this a miniature book. The font is also mini. Need a magnifying glass to read it. But Jane Austen is good in any form.
B008220B0C|5.0|Got this for my parents for their anniversary. She's a big Katy Perry fan and this is a must-see video for any Katy Perry fan.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|This was the first book I bought for my Kindle, and what a book it was! I haven't had the courage to dig into Walter Isaacson's other biographies, but if they are anything like this one then they could be converted to feature movies easily. The book just flows, each event leads on to the next smoothly, and there is never too much detail about things no-one wants to know about.<br /><br />I feel like I know Steve Jobs after reading this book, his good side, and his dirty side. His humble side, and his flamboyant and often selfish side. But I guess you don't get to the top without a huge amount of determination. And no-one is going to deny that Steve had that. Very good read.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|You will never see a fictional world as intriguing as the fantasy George R. R. Martin creates. Love this show.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I had never seen the first season of Eureka.  And I was pleased to see it available through Amazon prime.  I've watched 3 or 4 episodes and I love it.  Sci-fi with heart and humor.  The characters are great and the actors playing them are terrific.  I'll continue to watch all the episodes available. Thanks Amazon!
B00BEU6JVY|5.0|I could listen to Western Sky over and over. Wish the song was an hour long, it's that great. Also love Eastern Sun, Broken Dream, and In the Beginning. In Your Blue Eyes and It's Cold Outside of Your Heart are very good too.<br />I'm a country music fan so I love the country renditions of some of the songs. Justin clearly has the voice to sing country.<br />I just love hearing his calming reassuring voice and his soaring ranges along with all the vocal inflections he can still do. But I have loved the Moody Blues music for nearly half a century now mostly because of Justin's voice and songwriting and guitar phrases.<br />The dance club version of Out There Somewhere doesn't do anything for me so I left it out of my play list.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|If only it were possible to rate LIFE OF PI as a 10-stars video, based on the following:<br />* Plot--This story is as magical as the fairy tales that fascinated us as children<br />* Characters-- Despite their foreignness (to us) as Indians, they have universal appeal as a family of four embarking on a life-changing journey.  The father is strict, knowing that he must teach his sons life's lessons in order to survive.  The mother's compassionate, yet practical.  The older son is more like the father; not so vulnerable to life's travails.  Younger son, Pi, is soulful and his classmates' bullying has helped strengthen his character and his ability to overcome adversity by using his clever intelligence.<br />* Dialogue--Conversations are believable and flow alongside the narration.  While the characters have Indian accents, it is easy to understand what they are saying.<br />* Acting--It is amazing how well the main protagonist, Pi, portrays his role.  It is his first professional acting and his performance is exceptionally good.  Each actor has fulfilled his/her role admirably.<br />* Direction--Ang Lee is known for exploring complex themes.  His adaptation of the novel was outstanding.  He won the Best Director Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, pitted against the renowned Steven Spielberg.<br />* Sequencing--There are no disjointed cuts in this movie.  With so many locales and scenes, it is almost expected to be choppy in places.  The movie segues seamlessly from one moment to the next.<br />* Sets--Filming is done in India, Canada, on a ship, at sea, a tiny island, and in a hospital room.  The vast majority of it is at sea on a small lifeboat and flimsy raft.  The smallest details are included in each one, adding depth to their locales.<br />* Visual Effects--Done with CGI, it is impossible to discern if the animals are real or digitally portrayed.  Staring into the tiger's eyes is frightening and at times, breathtaking, as Richard Parker's (the tiger's) face assumes almost human emotions.<br />* Color--Simply spectacular!  We watched this on a Samsung TV, giving us an enormous spectrum of color in many shades. Compared to watching other movies and regular programming, the hues of this film were superior to anything else we have seen, except at movie theaters.<br />* Technology--Filmed in HD and 3D, viewers get as realistic a feeling of actually `being there' as possible.  Clarity overall was excellent and made the nighttime sea life and storm scenes `pop'.  The same is true for the island locale.  While we do not have 3D, we think those very scenes and locales must do a magnificent job of enhancing the experience.<br /><br />If you usually watch a movie more than once, then you can count on enjoying LIFE OF PI many times.es almost human emotions.<br />* Color--Simply spectacular!

B009MO5G90|5.0|This was the latest in the &#34;Resident Evil&#34; franchise! Thrills, action and horror were combined with breathtaking &#34;eye-candy&#34; 3-D technology to create a white knuckle film experience. I really loved the ending as well!

B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages! The voices and characters are funny and the animation is terrific. Highly recommended!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book was different than the first one. It was devastating about Marlee I literally almost fainted. I was depressed a lot in this book. But by the end it was happier. I want to be a writer myself. I read this book in two days. It was hard to put it down.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Loved this movie!  The plot was good and it had a two twists at the end.  Julianne Hough looks amazing too.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|I like several tracks on this album.  VERY different from their prior work.  I think it will grow on me.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This awesome throwback to the days of the Black Action Film was a sight to behold.  As an avid fan of that genre I was definitely happy with the dialogue and storyline of the slave turned hero in a film based on a ancient German Fantasy. The performance of the cast was superb as well.<br /><br />I heard that Will Smith turned this one down due to creative differences! I wonder if he had the chance to make the choice again would he make the same decision. If you like cool revenge oriented films and westerns then this is the one for you!  The violence is unparalleled so if you're sensitive then be warned!
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I got this thinking it would be lame, bit found the game very responsive and the action amazing. Well worth getting.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|For all the rave, the actors were really C-, and that is bad for all the A list actors in thjis movie. Even the porn was substandard. Sorry I bought it, expected better all around.
B00992CF6W|4.0|That never come out with an updated but Apple  I pad has been updated but not for my Kindle? Other than that it fun and would recommend it
0062073508|5.0|\\"The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.\\"<br /><br />What separates Hercule Poirot from many classic detective types is his level of oddness or eccentricity. I think that many times the suspects underestimate his deductive powers. A very keen and astute observer, the Belgium detective has a way of sizing up his suspect or, in this case, making sense of something that does not make sense. In this case, he is left without many of the resources that might normally allow for a much smoother investigation (being stuck on a train), so he must rely utmost on deduction and logic. As he so eloquently puts, this case is an \\"exercise of the brain.\\"<br /><br />Murder on the Orient Express is a classic case of Poirot's \\"little grey cells\\" being put to good use, as he is asked to solve the case of murder onboard a train. A key proponent in this mystery is the Armstrong case, in which a young girl in the Armstrong family was abducted and held for ransom, but later found dead. Many of the family members and members of the Armstrong household had tragedies soon follow, and Poirot discovers there is a link between this case and the murder on board. But who exactly has ties to the Armstrong family? As Poirot questions each of the prime suspects, he tries to figure out the facts and arrange them to a picture and timeline for the murder, evaluating each motive.<br /><br />There are several aspects that make Murder on the Orient Express a compelling and amazing mystery. First, the setting allows for a claustrophobic, quaint murder mystery, as all principle characters and possible suspects are stuck on the train together without means of escaping. Another intriguing factor is the level of duplicity and misdirection.  With so many different angles to look for, Poirot must not only separate truths from lies from possible suspects, but identify a motive for a suspect telling a truth or a lie. Finally, the building suspense keepsyou in the dark as long as possible, and there is effective tension in the book's final moments. The intensity culminates into a clever and amazing finish and denouement.<br /><br />The book itself is top-notch in its genre, one that has earned its reputation as a gold-standard in mysteries. It's easy to see why this book has been adapted to film on many occasions. If you are looking for a film version close to the book, the 1974 version (which boasts an all star cast) is pretty accurate.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read.  Some ethical issues to ponder. Would recommend to anyone interested in a great book.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|The best of history combined with the best of a mystery.  A winner for those of us who enjoy true-crime at its best.

B004LROMSO|4.0|I really liked Eva Green as Morgan, didn't like Campbell as Arthor, which cost it a star. I thought it waqs better than GoT and cannot see why they canceled it. Great potential in Merlin

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play solitaire so this keeps be busy for a long while.  I would recommend this game for all.
0812036034|5.0|I bought this for my Shakespeare class. Hell no I am not reading the original edition in hard to read language. This has a simple version next to it in PLAIN english so I can comprehend what the story is actually about instead of dozing off as i take in zero. It made me appreciate Shakespeare and enjoy this story. I used it for a college class (non-english majors) and I passed all quizzes and was able to discuss what happened and identify quotes. PLUS there is the original version on the page next to it. When the teacher asked what we thought the line meant I always had the answer.<br /><br />This makes me ENJOY the story, PASS the class and save TIME. Get this series for each adn every shakespear book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a great book.  It kept you going all the way through the book.  Highly recommend reading this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Friends have raved about this show so I got Netflix to see season 1.  Am waiting for 2 and 3 which I ordered from Amazon.  The characters are interesting and the story line has unexpected twists and turns which keep one involved.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I am glad to have read this great classic novel.  It is short and sweet; a great read.  This is a must read in a lifetime book.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|I have not finished this book, it is 900+ pages.  It is eye-opening (in terms of today's politics.  I will finish this book, and it has given me new perspective on Abe Lincoln (beliefs and viewpoints)
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Ages in 50's, 20's, and 8; male and female, we all enjoyed this movie and are anxious for the next one.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|New take that is steeped in myth and legend, nephilim as portrayed by Enoch. Easy watch and an opportunity to start your kids or grand-kids on a quest for wonderful folk lore. Explore a world that might be more truth than legend, great fodder for &#34;living room camping&#34;.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After reading Mr. Hosseini's first 2 books I was very excited to jump into this one.  Unfortunately, this book was not up to the same level.  I did not come to care for the characters like I did in Kite Runner, as I was jumping back and forth so much and skipping huge swaths of time.  If this was his first book I don't think I would have been disappointed, but he has set the bar very high.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Jut got in to Season Two; got hooked on this show in the first season.  Be prepared, this show is gorey!
B009R659L8|5.0|I just can't put her books down.  I have read all her books but couldn't pick out one favorite. She is definately my favorite Queen of Mystery.  They  deserve 5 stars!!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app is a must have for anyone that has actual computer experience. Using this app removes the frustration of using the Kindle Fire without a file manager built into the Op Sys. Sure, one can connect the Kindle to a PC to do most (but not all) of the same functions, but this app brings a resident file manager to the device. So glad I found this from an on-line blog site.<br /><br />Get This!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I must say that I originally bought this to see the music browsers in the &#34;Tower&#34; record store as they came from the Borders store where I worked.  And they filmed part of it here in South Florida.  But I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  I had forgotten about the music.  Fun movie.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Not the best movie ever, but I didn't wish I had the two hours of my life back. A good rental
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is a very kind, generous person.  Even though she downplays the things she does for people you know she is just very giving.  Love her show, her book and her.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I just started playing but I already love it! I can not believe how awesome it is! Great for all ages.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game!  Kinda nerdy but who isn't.  I highly recommend it for just about any age.  We play it on the weekends with friends and everyone seems to get a kick out of it.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|No more please. Bruce Willis is always great, but this was a disappointment. I don't recommend putting yourself through this movie.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Wrrks well when traveling,or just aitting at the table or favorire chair.Easy to use and fits in my wife's pure.Good for gaming and e-mails.
1433502410|5.0|A very detailed and informative study Bible. The notes are comprehensive and informative with strong academics behind each. Many study Bibles give you a &#34;life application&#34; that is as obvious as reading the text but this gives you information that is useful in interpretation and understanding the issues behind the text. The extras such as the maps are very well placed and useful. It's the most complete Study bible one will probably find.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Even though you can figure out the ending pretty soon, it was still a good read. Have to see the movie now
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the apps that make Amazon rich with its kindle fire but if they don't hurry up they will just regret it. If you see below at the other newest opinions or at the Amazon's discussion page all the people say &quot;Argh, why didn't I get an IPad instead&quot; This is just because a little app didn't updated jet. We are all waiting but every day till the app gets updated Amazon will lose costumers and Money.
0307913090|5.0|I and many of my friends are GoT addicts and have read all the available books (including graphic novels) and watch the show religiously, but we have to mind what we say around my husband lest we drop a giant spoiler. I finally decided, since my husband isn't a big reader, to give him the audio books for his birthday. Now he can see for himself just how much better the books are than the show, he'll be able to discern what's different between the two, and he can start joining in the discussions and swapping of theories from now on.<br />The reading and voices of each character is done so well, my husband is already addicted!
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|Very glad Carlos did not hang his spikes yet , he is a great Artis . Lot of great songs in this cd, happy and outgoing like always .
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I didn't think I would find another story that was so awesome. But this story is better and I can't wait for the next book.
B002QRWJA4|3.0|The movie was a splendid production. The practice by video techs of resizing the broadcast image screen format has taken some of the luster from the movie. There are some cases where seeing it all in the way it was originally filmed shows more. Thisis one.<br />Thank you<br />HV
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like this game because it is a quick and simple game but you do have to watch what you are doing.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read several reviews that Charlaine used a ghost writer, and those people are full of cheap! I loved every minute of reading and even more so I am happy with the ending!!!!
B000SLP4SE|3.0|Good movie Mark W classic action packed movie. My question is why is there so many movies portraying a deceitful government? From experience or imagination?
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is great! It blocks any attempts to do anything except the other apps I've put under this one. It even keeps my toddler from accidentally getting on the internet because so other apps have the link things on them. I love having this app.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|great game just wish you could sell cards that you cant use in your deck.  plus the whole having to buy gems thing so that you can even get better cards is kind of a downer
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love to get lost in though!<br />The game kept me occupied and entertained! posted<br />The game is compelling and well worth the time spent playing.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Love this game, except that it freezes up sometimes. And I love being able to change the backgrounds. Much harder than it looks.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In is an excellent book because it desccribes precisely what one can do to promote herself (also good for men) in the workplace. Although, not every man's action should be copied, there are some things worth learning.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|First of all, it took a long time to load, so be prepared to wait to play about 3 min. Second, in order to finish the whole game ( there are about 90 levels ) , you can purchase more Aura to help out your kingdom. Seriously?! I mean, some of the packs cost more than $100!!! Who would want to buy something with actual money for a video game that they already spent hard earned money for? , most of the levels are really hard, so get ready to play them over and over again until you win. Kids might need some help playing the game. Otherwise, it is a great addicting game  with beautiful graphics.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|love love love Eminem!!!! one of our all time fav artists!!! :) 10 thumbs up! def great buy. if u love Eminem this is one for u!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Given the incredible popularity of angry birds, I can't believe it needs ANOTHER review.  But since Amazon wants me to review it, here it is.  This game is awesome, specifically for quieting kids when they're driving you insane.  Therefore, if you have a child you are obligated to get this game.  Also, ad free version means that my kid isn't going to accidentally download porn or try to buy a gadget we don't need or sign up for lifelock.<br />Definitely worth the few cents required for the ad-free version.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, however the lack of storyline, plot and characters led to a disappointing reading experience. I do credit the author with creating a vision of a circus that I would love to attend, however that intricately woven fabric of the circus could not make up for the lack of a story.  Nothing seems to happen for the first half of the book other than cryptic discussions between characters that lead nowhere.  Considering the hype surrounding this book, it was not worth the time.
159448385X|4.0|THis is just a great story about the women in foreign countries who have little freedom and are under the rule of men.  Something as women we are all taught.  But they got out and what began as jealous rivalry between these two women ended with a wonderful devotion between them.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I chose this product because the picture showed the slots for it to stand in so it did not slip while using it. The slots do not hold it if it is on an angle like your lap. I kept slipping out of it so I had to fold it up and manually hold on to it. I am not impressed. I do like how it snaps in but I cannot get it to turn like the picture, so for the 2 reasons that I purchased it for it does not work for me.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Now before I begin let me state that I simply never, and I mean NEVER rate products on amazon no matter now spectacular it may be. However, this album is far beyond spectacular and astonishing and after being a huge follower of Lindsey since she was a beginner youtube star for a couple of her first pieces, as soon as I read she was putting an album together I was too excited for words. You can rip her songs from youtube all you want, but the production value of this CD is great and the older songs almost remastered in a sense are almost like completely different songs and are simply amazing. Her new songs on this CD are kept on replay for the majority of my ipods battery life. Her music is pure talent and I can not wait to hear her in concert when she gets state side again (shes currently doing a European tour). This album is so good I bought it the day it dropped (and come on who pays for music anymore right?) but loving just the simple previews you get I knew I not only wanted the better quality, but wholeheartedly wanted to support her in the music business so she will be able to make more of this amazing music. Its so good in fact I plan to buy a hard copy of her album (already own it through itunes) just to have in my car as not only a back up but to share her music to anyone in my car! Please if you are a music lover, I strongly recommend this album and would force you to buy it if I were able to come through the computer screen!!!
B000BVD460|5.0|love love love Eminem!!!! one of our all time fav artists!!! :) 10 thumbs up! def great buy. if u love Eminem this is one for u!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Great story that hooks you from the beginning. The animation is pretty realistic, and after a while, you begin to buy into the illusion of it being &#34;real&#34;. Tintin is smart and hip, the dog is the same. It's good for kids and adults. Its family entertainment, without it being too cutesy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book takes many twists and turns. Your never sure who you want to hate in this book. Terrific ending.
6304117302|5.0|The widescreen original version of this movie<br />is much more valued then the DVD version.<br />It keeps the original story  line in &#34;flow&#34; with<br />the characters. Why they edited and changed<br /> the DVD version, one can only guess at!
075695195X|5.0|I loved this book (and the entire series), it was sarcastic and had a light-hearted humor that just enhanced the overall suspensful and action packed plot.  The characters were memorable and lovable and the character growth and development throughout the series is wonderfully done.  It is a fantasy world that I loved to be apart of and fully enjoyed.  I always recommend this book to fantasy lovers of all ages and it is definitely worthy of a read!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the book, but once I got about 8% (Kindle Fire) into it, the reading became akin to riding a roller coaster through the Pacific northwest. Reminds me of myself as well as my dearest  true friends.  Solitude finds you and sometimes you find solitude. Either way, it's good. Beautiful reading.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an amazing series.  I've been waiting for something as good as West Wing and now I found it!  Great writing - quick, interesting, historical, intellectual with drama!  Awesome!
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this cd. It is smooth and calming and Paul Anka still has it. Good music,
B00B81B0HC|5.0|, alternative rock with a bit of electronic accents, MWAH! Uhmmm...missing the song &#34;Working Man&#34; though :'( ONE OF THE BEST SONGS MAN COME ON! I adore them, soulful, hopeful, meaningful, beautiful, etc etc etc! &#60;3
055358894X|5.0|This is an epic novel because it is just awesome.  I loved the plot, it just kept going and getting more complex and more involved until I could barely manage to contain my excitement while reading it and I would have to run around my house telling everyone I saw how thrilling and suspenseful my book was... In my mind I envisioned something along the lines of Ocean's Eleven with the thievery and unpredictability of the plot with a mix of Pirates of the Carribean with the wit and swordsmanship and fighting.  Maybe it started off a bit slow but once I got into it I could barely eat or sleep because I just wanted to read and do absolutely nothing else.  It is worth the read everyone, highly recommended!!!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Does exactly what it says, and does it well. Thanks Amazon for giving us free Apps everyday Google could learn a thing or two.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I usually don't read this type of book. the dystopian, doomsday, science fiction type (hmmm but is it really science fiction or could it be science fact in the future?).  I had several friends on facebook tell me how wonderful the Wool series was so I had to try it. I finished the Omnbibus edition in 3 days.  In fact most of my Saturday I spent with my nose glued to my kindle.  I don't usually write reviews either but had to tell the author just how much I enjoyed it.  I do have to admit that if I had only had the first book I would have stopped after that because I was a little disappointed in the ending, but I'm glad I didn't.  The rest of the story brought to light why it ended that way and it was well worth it.  Get this book and savor it. I felt for the people in this book, sometimes the book even made me claustrophic.  The people who have read it will know what I mean.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by Daft Punk innovation in music.  A brilliant step forward by looking back!  Definitely a refreshing change in new music.

B001DUDKEY|4.0|Those who enjoy Jane Austin will find this later work to be a brilliant commentary on the English social system.  Knowing Austin's writing style slowly leads you to a fore gone conclusion of well laid elements of what will become known as a &#34;well made play&#34;.  Foreshadowing is marked and fulfilled leaving the reader/viewer satisfied.
B00AEFYBOM|4.0|This Reviewer was poised to generally dislike this \\"crowd pleaser\\" from 1993 but found it very moving in many spots, albeit about 15 minutes too long and with too much musical orchestration. (Do I see a foggy pier...do I hear violins?).<br /><br />This is the best acting I've seen with Demi, she is dynamic and explosive - then very vulnerable. Harrelson struggles a bit to keep up with her, dramatically, but is okay...nice to see him in close-up and expressive...we are all so used to watching him in long shots on CHEERS. (I guess I need to catch up on his movie career!).<br /><br />A great performance by Redford, as Gage, the billionaire, helped by great lighting...and suits. Not to play spoiler but his acting in his final scene, inside the luxurious limo, as he resigns to uncharacteristic failure, is amazing. And...he is really the only player here to have gone through a transformation...for most of the movie, we assume that *he* will be the one riding off into the California sunset, for his next \\"quest\\".<br /><br />All three chase a \\"dream\\"...But will it be the two blue collars who actually catch it? That's it...see the movie!  :)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very relaxing and addictive game. Great graphics and beautiful colour scheme create an under water fantasy world. Wonderful clean game for kids.
B0029WGIE4|3.0|I received the album with a bend of the left side I'm not completely sure if it was caused by the shipping and handling
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I down loaded the movie and took my lap top camping. When I clicked play, it said it had to buffer. It couldn't because I didn't have internet connection there, THE WHOLE REASON  I DOWNLOADED!
B003U51D58|5.0|Hard not to love this series. Every episode entices u to watch the next. Don't try to just &#34;jump&#34; in! Start at episode 1, season 1, or by the time u hit season 3-4 ,YOU will be &#34;LOST&#34;. Open mind required:)
B004YWU8GQ|3.0|have already a few movie's with the same title - just had to have it for my collection - by all means a good one
B007L6VR12|5.0|If the movie gods didn't create Wes Anderson somebody would have to.  Never in the history Of Western cinema has there been an individualist like Anderson.  His genteel rebellious streak is unlike any other.  His films feel like a parallel universe with characters much like ourselves who are slightly off kilter.  \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" finds Anderson at his most romantic.  Our protagonists are Sam (Jared Gillman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) two disaffected adolescents who find each other and run away from unfeeling authority figures to explore the island terrain and their feelings for one another.  Gillman and Hayward are natural and unaffected and at their tender ages can't be faulted for not tapping into the ironies contained in Anderson and Roman Coppola's script.  The ironies, however, are not lost on the adult cast members (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, et. al.).  \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is a piece with Anderson's iconoclastic body of work.  If I could give more than five stars to the film I would.
B00BMQDM10|3.0|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella's book.  She is funny!<br />But this was not my favourite.  It was a good read but I just didn't love it like I usually do,
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Funny movie with realistic setting. Not for kids but very hilarious.  I would watch it again.  I laughed the whole movie.
B00382S9N2|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie???  The storyline, music, and the dancing!!!!!  I can never watch this too often, so I do!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I enjoy it just as much as my kids if not more. It is addicting and I do loose track of time. I still don't have any friends to visit their village so I can't complete that quest. Can some one help me with that? Contact me at [...] Thanks I appreciate it. I Wish there was a way to talk to other players in app like on the City Story game.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This is the third in the series A Song of Ice and Fire and did not disappoint. I am already plowing through A Feast of Crows and know I will love it just as much as the other three. Martin's ability to intertwine his characters through an epic fictional 'history' of kingdoms and far off lands is amazing. It does not seem to matter from one character to the next the story threads keep forever running through your mind and each character's life history and deeds all seem to affect each other. Thank you Mr Martin for your wonderful ability to make pure fantasy and fiction so real and life like.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|If you like computer chess, this is for you; and it's free. The graphics are great and it's a good game of chess which will improve your game. The only thing I don't like is you don't see the pieces taken on the side and I was confused with the color of the pieces. I thought the pieces were brown and white when actually they're brown and black.

B004GK2B6Q|5.0|Love this movie, story line is cute and solid, little boys love the &#34;scare&#34; factor, but the animation is amazing and why I watch this movie
B003YL4LYI|3.0|3-stars since I haven't read it yet. With that said, I noticed that there seems to be way too many generic 5- star reviews here lately- generic because the reviewers don't offer anything specific about what they read. All they write about are &#34;great characters&#34; or &#34;plot twists&#34; or &#34;great book, can't wait for the next one.&#34;<br />On the other hand, most of the critical reviews offer specifics on why DwD is not up to par with the first three books.<br />Is someone trying to water down the negative reviews?<br />Btw, I've been reading this series since 2002 up to Feast for Crows (which came out 5 years after SoS) but would stop there as I'm afraid GRRM would never finish this series. DwD came out 6 years after FfC.

B00CWV8X04|3.0|Decent not great....Rooney Mara is the best part and that's coming from a Channig Tatum fan!  Worth a rent.  Enjoy

B0058W74UY|1.0|I thought this was gonna be a good app,I thought I could get this app so maybe I could play direct TV on it but it does not work..So again it sucks...Thanks everyone for the heads up on this app.<br />Maybe Amazon should not use  this app.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Characters are not believable. Very poor story line, I forward even through the sex scenes. This is a lifeless film the dialogue is artificial and shallow, lots of fill-ins that have nothing to do with the movie's theme (which was?)Most of the movie develops inside a limo.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I bought the first series and then this one. I will get the third and final series also. I really like this a lot and wish they would continue on further,but just as always..........good things will always end sometimes....:)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book!!!! Would highly recommend. I really enjoyed this book. A tear jerker in some spots but definitely worth putting in the time to read.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The good guys always do well with Quetin, tho' there be alot of blood along the way.  Fox said this film taught him things he didn't know about character transformation during a film and I would recommend this film to anyone who likes action, justice and cleverly scripted counterpoint.
B00007KQA3|4.0|This is the best of the 1984 movies.<br />Not the best transfer and not any extra's.Still the one I would buy.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Just one piece of advice to the many readers out there..... Read This Book. Heart of obsidian is a wonderful story about love that survived against all odds. Buy this latest Singh novel. You won't regret it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Could not put it down. A unique story with vivid characters. I was completely sucked in. Hope she writes more.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|the most amazing game ever, I absolutely love it. Pros: it has tons of levels, it's the free app of the day, Cons: the levels are a bit hard but that makes it even more enjoyable
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can I say about this app? It's free and it works great. The numbers are large and easy to see, and it does the basic functions of a calculator.
B007FROH4G|5.0|My Mother has dementia and it gave me an insight to how she thinks.  both my Sister and wife has read it and both also thoroughly enjoyed the book. We could relate to a lot of the issues.
0446585041|5.0|A quick read, but you will find yourself laughing and smirking throughout while reading it.  Highly recommended if you want a book to read that doesn't take much thought.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game adds a great new dynamic to cut the rope with having two om noms (twice the on nom twice the fun)

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game this is the best game in the boll wide world this game is one of my favorite
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Ok, first off let me say that I am a die-hard Megadeth fan. I have every album in their catalog. When I heard that Dave Mustaine & co. were working on a new album last winter I was very excited. Their last album \\"Thirteen\\" was very well produced & seemed to have songs that were examples of all the work they had done in the past. So I had a feeling that this new album entitled \\"Super Collider\\" was going to be the beginning of a new era for Megadeth. I was right! Forget the fact that Megadeth is best known for some of the greatest thrash-metal albums of all time. Super Collider is not a full on thrash metal assault, it's more of a straight up heavy metal album & I think they did a terrific job! I mean, if you really listen to the music this band is making now, you can't deny how talented they are. To be able to make these kinds of songs after years of thrash metal is remarkable. I love it when bands try something a little new because it comes across fresher. Anyway, for those of you who are fans of Megadeth, I think this is a must have. Hell its good enough for any metal-head. Just try to have an open mind & you might be surprised.
B003G4W49C|5.0|amazing book, I loved it so much. So much fun to read and so masturfully written. The ending was a little annoying tho
B00AHSKRJ4|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed watching this, the actors seem to play real roles and do a nice job.  Thank goodness for second chances.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the realistic graphics. The challenges were difficult but not impossible. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B009X2U1I2|3.0|If love Todd Mcfarlane ghis is a classic. The old animation series is way better. Wish ghey would redo this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVE this series and I thought this book was the best one yet!! Before I purchased I saw a lot of bad reviews and thought how is it even possible to have a bad book about ace and angel!! But I recommend to ignore them because it was amazing! We finally get to see them happy and together and they learn how to face their demons together!<br /><br />I am soo glad there are two more books in this series because I am not ready for it to be over!! A lot of questions were answered but there is more to find out! Can't wait!!  If you are a true fan you will LOVE it!! :)
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like having this in kindle fire favorites. Quick look to see battery strength with one quick touch. I think it was worth the installation.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|A lot of fun, the talent, the storyline, something for the not so young and their parents.  Leaves you whistling, and smiling..
B004YW4L5K|4.0|This is not a tight neatly wrapped story.  Kind of an epic tale of God's in our modern lives.  Makes you think. Keeps you curious.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes there is much repetition but the development and psychological aspect of the main characters is well developed and easy to relate to, at least for me. The bdsm aspect is just a plus if you actually enjoy that sexual world as much as I do. =)
0307596885|5.0|Have read almost everything Ms. Munro has written.  Always worth reading.  The first story put me off somewhat.  Months later picked up book again and am glad that I did.
B000002LIX|4.0|Sounding off with a mixture of raw, heavily-granular, aggressively-paced power chords coupled with unhinged, off-the-chains lead breaks that positively rippled, basslines that were both anchoring and accelerative, and drumwork both highly-centered yet utterly abandoned in its tribal ferocity, the first five tracks of \\"Ritual De La Habitual\\" are  as intense as anything I've heard in the (nearly) 23 years after its release in 1990, my then- 23 year-old ears blistered by the assaultive ( yet fluidly dynamic) metallic oversheen in which the banshee-like wailing of the lead vocalist was embedded within.<br /><br />Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, Stephen Perkins, and Perry Farrell were, respectively in order and collectively together, the musicians responsible for laying down one of the most brutally melodic first sides recorded in the past two-and-a-half decades, with \\"Stop\\", \\"No One's Leaving\\", \\"Ain't No Right\\", \\"Obvious\\", and breakout cut \\"Been Caught Stealing\\" all transformed into a savage Dionysian romp notable not only for its furious tempo but relative brevity as well. \\" Three Days\\", with its dynamic shifts from quiescence to sustained explosiveness over the course of its epic 9+ minute-length, is a promising opener for the back half, until the band gets bogged down in the overly-orchestrated biographical and didactive \\" Then She Did\\" and \\"Of Course\\", redeemed partially at the end with the slow-burn to galloping-crescendo of mutated heavy power-ballad \\"Classic Girl\\".<br /><br />My own favorite of their first two full-length releases happens to be this one, which even with its two relative misfires holds together more cohesively than \\"Nothing's Shocking\\", holds a slight qualitative edge in production, and is a little less pretentious, though perhaps not presenting with cuts that, individually considered once others are excised, are quite as memorable. Worth it for the first five cuts alone, a sheer sonic assault with heavily pronounced grooves, and, yes, I recommend it.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Well done!  I like history told like a story and when acted well, its the perfect combination.  Very interesting that even then, politics was played like a fiddle, fortunately for us.

B00846REIS|1.0|This is clearly a total copy of 50 shades of grey. It was sooo similar and so corny. I read it anyways thinking it would get better. I wasted my time.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Of course another Crossfire book will be coming out. The author left cookbook much unsaid. GGGGGRRRRRR! No surprise there. I felt like this book was lacking everywhere but the hot spots. I wanted more substance, and more to lead me to the fourth book.
B00BSBXA98|2.0|I thought it would be impossible to replicate the Crique experience on the TV. I was right, Good box seats are the best way to experience Cirque. You feel like you are missing all the side activity that surprises and enhances the in person experience.<br /><br />If you are a Cirque fan, save your money.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre's now has the privatization of national security firmly in his sights.  A disturbing look at the &#34;war on terror&#34; and its aftermath.  Somehow he manages to keep right up with the tone of the times all through the transition from his own experiences in cold war days up to the present.  The sense of realism is still there and hard to match.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love how it ended in a cliff hanger and I can't wait to read the next book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Read it

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this CD I have recently started to update my music collections and this is one I just had to have.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I like most Bruce Willis movies. I love the Die Hard series, but this one is easily the weakest of the bunch. It almost seems like the movie was created to introduce John McClane's son so that we now have another generation of McClanes to kick a*s and take names. The plot is weak and really contrived. Even with all of that, I am still amazed at how Willis can deliver some of those lines and get away with them. I believe that he is one of only a few actors that can do this. I will give him credit for that, but that is about all. If you are a Willis or Die Hard fan, you will be disappointed.
B0009P66TK|3.0|Its a good material and design, the price is just to pay, no moré Than $ 85 for this kind of want ches is just to pay.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Should have read the reviews. I'm sure it is good on the artsy level but I fell asleep. About a very short, specific period in Lincoln's life.
B00881VLCE|3.0|One of the only jigsaw apps I've found that is somewhat challenging. Uses cut pieces not squares. It also lets you choose piece count option. Wish the apps would save and could keep finished in pictures.

B000JCQCW4|1.0|I like Ellen Burstyn, and can't imagine why she wanted to be a part of this movie.  This is an alarming movie and there is nothing to the characters other than drugs, very unlikeable people!  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

1405910275|4.0|Really enjoyed the book, I think Sylvia day has done well to draw you into the storyline. Didn't really like the ending but can't wait for the next book to follow just hope I dont have to wait as long.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love that the show is not only funny, but has characters with heart and real problems they have to work through. The guest stars are awesome as well: Leonard Nemoy, Will Wheaton, Lemar Burton, Stephen Hawking! Wow! I still chuckle through every episode...I hope they can keep it up in season 7!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Historical movies always tell a broadly fictional story from someone else's restricted viewpoint.  Lincoln is simply that--a contrived accounting of words spoken, tempers engaged and personalities in conflict thrashing out the details of legislation against the back drop of something REALLY significant, but made relatively unimportant, namely the death and slaughter of an obscene number of men on numerous battlefields during the atrocity of the Civil War!  Spielberg's Lincoln, acting like some autocrat or dictator (full of his own self importance) very much like Napoleon, or maybe Stalin, decides he's got all the answers and everyone else must comply. Set the propaganda wheels in motion, the country will implode if we don't pass the 14th!!!!!!!! His devious maneuverings paint him as a duplicitous leader; probably the only true part of the story.  Save yourself the dollars and drag out your old U.S. History book from high school; it's a much better way to spend a few hours and it's a lot more factual than Spielberg's fanciful story telling! YAWN!!!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|if you're like me, and I'm sure you are, then endless hours of killing off humanity with horrid diseases is a reasonable use of your time.  So imagine your delight stumbling across this hedonistic gem.  I've wasted the world population dozens of time and will do so dozens more.  You should join us in high 12 Monkeys style fun and erase humanity from the earth.  Hell, it's only a buck.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I was never a big fan of The Catcher in the Rye but I am a fan of this book.  Though this book is written about the acts of children it is easy to forget that children are the ones doing these painful and awful things.  However, it's easy to remember, even these many years later receiving such cruelty from other children who never really understood the pain they inflicted.  Of course the book points out that the real cruelty is inflicted by the adults who understand perfectly well the terrible acts they are doing.
1400069742|3.0|This popular history of American culture and politics before America's entry into the Second World War is cleverly structured as a series of short biographies. We may be grateful that two stars of the show, Robert E. Sherwood and Lord Lothian (Philip Kerr, the British Ambassador) are here given their place in the sun after being largely forgotten for seventy years. Sherwood, a leading playwright of the Thirties, is mainly remembered these days for having been friend to Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker. They worked together on the old Life magazine--the post-collegiate college-humor periodical, not the Luce picture-magazine--before they quit this employment and then briefly attempted to write in a shared office. Lothian had the thankless job of representing Britain in the early months of the War, when Britain hadn't a prayer of getting assistance from the US. Poor Lothian's fate was to be loved by all and trusted by none in his own government. He supported the war, so the pacifists didn't like him; he was considered to be in the \\"Cliveden Set,\\" so the leftists and Churchillites distrusted him. His own family turned against him when he left the Catholic Church to follow Nancy Astor into Christian Science. Earnest and ascetic, of highly sensitive temperament, he was no doubt killed by all the strain when he suddenly died of uremic poisoning in 1940.<br /><br />Another half-forgotten, slightly sorry figure in the book is Wendell Willkie, the sometime corporate lawyer and utilities executive who got himself tagged as a charismatic political comer, and was assiduously promoted by Republican moderates as the 1940 Presidential candidate. After many convention ballots, vying against Senator Bob Taft and young Governor Tom Dewey, he did get the nomination. In press and polls he often looked like a shoo-in against the fading FDR, then running for a notorious Third Term. But Willkie went down hard, tangled up in the anti-interventionist political climate of the time. Like Roosevelt, Willkie was officially non-interventionist while privately favoring aid to Britain. In the end there wasn't enough of a compelling case for Willkie. After losing the election, he lost most of the goodwill he still had with the GOP by befriending Roosevelt and agreeing to go on a fact-finding world tour. He reemerged as a GOP contender in 1944, but was so unpopular he withdrew from campaigning, and a few months later dropped dead.<br /><br />Charles A. Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, recur throughout the book but remain multi-talented ciphers. Col. Lindbergh's prominence here is of course due to his opposition to American involvement in the War. Characteristically, he stood alone for most of that controversy, joining up with Kingman Brewster's America First organization only in its last months. It came as something of a surprise to him that FDR had no commission or other use for him during the conflict. (Although, once FDR was safely dead, the Truman Administration had no trouble appointing him as consultant to the new U.S. Air Force.)<br /><br />The missing element to this history, and it's a big one, is a discussion of the overtly left-wing, Popular Front, and Communist campaigning for and against American involvement. This omission is significant not just because of the size and power of those political interests, but because the anti-war factions often framed their arguments directly in response to them. And the pro-Stalinist camp was itself part of the anti-interventionist movement for a long time, from September 1939 till June 1941.sevelt, Willkie was officially non-interventionist while privately favoring aid to Britain.

B000VIK8D0|5.0|To be honest, I've watched 'Wyatt Earp' more often than I've watched 'Heat'. That said, if you enjoy 'Heat', with both it's thorough character development and the collision of all those developed characters, you'll enjoy many of the same elements in 'Wyatt Earp'. The movie has a great cast, and to be honest, I prefer Dennis Quaid's version of Doc Holliday to that of Val Kilmer's. Dennis Quaid's version seems to be more correctly rough around the edges, what you'd expect from a character that's supposed to have a dubious past. I haven't read up much on the history that most westerns are based on, so I'm not going to say the movie is historically accurate, but the story feels like it all goes together to make a well told story. When I have a few hours to spend watching a movie, this one's always one of the movies I consider popping into the DVD / Blu-ray player.
B0034PJWJ8|5.0|Excellent as a movie, then a VHS tape, then two different DVDs, now a Blu-ray.  Get it now, Who fans!

B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie but it was horrible.  It was so confusing and strange that we ended up turning it off after 15 to 20 min.  What a waste of money (I'm just glad I only paid to rent it and didn't buy the stupid thing)!

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I like this show-mostly because it doesn't have a bunch of teenage drama, naked people or ridiculous love triangles. It's a crime/drama with a unique story line and characters. I was a little worried the show was going to take a turn for the soap opera in the last episode, but in the end it worked out ok. (Don't want to spoil it for anyone!)

193700788X|1.0|I'm massively disappointed in the last chapter of this series. The \\"break-up\\" between Eric and Sookie was just stupid, and while I don't mind who Sookie ended up with, I would've preferred it to be introduced slowly instead of just jumping into bed together at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />You can't magically roofie two people with a faerie relic, and expect me to accept the deus ex machina cheat. That's asking too much. I've seen a decline in the quality of Harris' books over the years, but I think this is perhaps the worst entry thus far. Too bad it's the last, and the series went out with a whimper instead of a bang.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I rated this a five mainly on the graphical experience. I'm always surprised when the games for the kindle are this involved. It kept my attention until I was able to get to the end. The only thing that was a bit annoying was there was a little too many search for items puzzles. in my opinion there could be like 5 less puzzles within the game and something more intricate to find pieces you would need to proceed in the game.

B004UID2LC|5.0|Anythign I see on YOUTUBE that I want the song not the video, this gets it for me and it works well, so YES YES I perosnally recommend it.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is basically the same game as Princess Makeup Salon - Girls Games.  You give the girls spa treatments and<br />then design their makeup and hairstyles.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game! It engaged me, I spent hours playing and kept my kindle plugged in and tethered to it. The graphics were amazing and very surprising. Once I passed it I gave to my 15 year old daughter and she also couldn't put it down. It was equally creepy because of the music. The puzzles were detailed and some of them had me stumped for awhile.
B00BU18U82|5.0|Great game! Needs more crops and livestock. You will have to pay $1.30 a piece for bigger equipment. You can't even harvest corn until you pay for a harvester. In total you will spend about $10 for everything.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Once I start I don't want to stop!! Love it! Even my 5 year old plays this app. Then he cries when time is up:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it wish you could know when it updates though but it's a really good game wish it had more though
B004IDG97S|5.0|Stallone is absolutely priceless in this movie. The second Dredd movie is also good but this movie is the best!!!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Is there another movie genre as maligned as horor? I don't think so. From gratuitous gore fests, silly slasher cesspools and remakes that rarely live up to the originals, Hollywood and even indie film directors have had their way with horror and they all too frequently don't deliver. Some directors even try REALLY hard, and offer up plot twists to make up for other shortcomings, and while I do enjoy a surprising plot element I didn't see coming, having seen so many horror films, I usually am not surprised as the filmmakers intended.<br /><br />Enter The Woman In Black. Right from the first moment, you know that this isn't going to be your run of the mill, disappointing, predictable scare vehicle. In fact, if you DO go into this one trying to find some evidence that you're about to discover some crazy secret as a plot twist, you will be disappointed. Radcliffe's character isn't one of the boys the woman did away with, back for some purpose or any other devious possible surprise. No, the filmmakers decided that a simple, straight up story about a ghost imposing vengeance to the rest of the town's children after losing her boy was just the right amount of motivation they needed to inspire enough scares from the creepy old gothic house and surrounding area.<br /><br />There are similarities to other ghost type stories such as the point when in order to hopefully put the woman to rest, he goes into a swamp/marsh to retrieve her boy's body to put with the woman in her coffin, highly reminiscent of 'The Ring' well sequence, but ultimately, similarities don't matter. There are enough genuine bone chilling moments to fluff the hair on the back of your neck for two movies, and the acting from all actors is far above the norm usually seen for horror films. As for Radcliffe and whether he's got the acting chops to move past Harry Potter and into more adult roles, rest assured he can. He himself is left to carry much of the weight of the movie on his shoulders for long periods of time alone, save for the woman and some of the ghosts of her victims keeping him company, and he does it brilliantly and believably.<br /><br />I also particularly like that the filmmakers were not afraid to rebel against tying everything up into a neat little package where everyone is ok at the end, and they also left it without a real 'hey there's gonna be a sequel' moment as well. Oh sure, they could do another one, but the way the film ends, it can more than stand alone on its' own merit, and I for one hope it does. This film was so good, I wouldn't want to see a hacked up rehashed sequel with extra explanations etc, etc. Sometimes, as in this case, the one film is enough.<br /><br />So, If you're sick and tired of the same horror song being played again for the umpteenth time and want a throwback to great old ghost stories, The Woman In Black is for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game! but the updates take a while....  so can you make the updates not take so long please!
B00022GJ4M|5.0|I'm not a big blues fan.  Well, let me correct that.  I'm not a fan of the artists and the records that people like Muddy Waters influenced.  I'm talking about the English and American blues rockers who, for the most part, bore me to tears.  There are a few blues things I like, own and listen to: several Charles Brown CD's, all of the Robert Johnson stuff, a little T-Bone Walker, and this CD.<br /><br />Muddy Waters' Hard Again contains all of the qualities I look for in music: humor, great playing and singing, originality, a strong point of view, and great songwriting.  This one's got 'em all, and it's got them in spades.  Many people who know much more about this kind of music than I do view Hard Again as some sort of comeback record for Muddy Waters.  I don't know about that, but after I heard it, I went back and listened to all of Muddy Waters' recordings.  After doing so, I can tell you this: Hard Again is by far my favorite.<br /><br />Earlier, I said that I didn't like a lot of blues rock.  The reason that I don't (I think) is because most of it doesn't swing.  It just lies there.  It's missing the \\"roll\\" in rock & roll.  This one rolls.  It swings. (Not in the Sinatra sense of the word, but believe me it swings.)<br /><br />You should definitely buy this one.  If you are a hardcore blues fan, Hard Again will be a nice addition to your collection.  If (like me) you are not, you'll have what (I think) we all want: excellent music that will keep you listening, thinking, and bobbing your head for decades to come.
1596680296|5.0|This is the 3rd sock knitting book that I purchased, hoping to become comfortable with sock knitting.  I especially was uncomfortable sock knitting, because my fiance and I have pretty large feet, as we are both well over 6 feet tall.<br /><br />This book explains sock knitting with simple and easy terms, gentle encouraging words, but one of my favorite parts of this book is that it tells me how much yarn I will need for all sock sizes whether I am knitting with fingering weight, DK/ Sport weight, worsted all the way up to bulky weight.  That is extremely helpful, because previously, most of the ladies who sell me my yarn have underestimated the amount of yarn that I need, but Ms. Budd has been honest with me through her book.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Budd for writing this book!
B007FIY3VW|4.0|It is helpful to have familiar programs on my tablet.  I will enjoy using this one to track my documents.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|ok I loved the movie so why not this right! its fun trying to bring more fish to your reef and building  the reef it self is my favorite part! so soothing and beautiful :))
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Although not the best movie on this type I have seen this is a very interesting take on an old story. It definitely is a quirky love story with a good twist at the end. The acting is what you would expect with this type of movie giving the actors good reasons to ham it up. All in all it is a good piece of fluff for a no brainer night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This item is so awesome you should get this you will love it you will get addicted to the game all live .
B0035LJF2U|5.0|I've had this concert in VHS and DVD form since it's release in the 1980's, and have watched it over and over though out the years.<br />Streaming it in HD for free through my Prime membership was a treat.  Watching it in HD on my 47&#34; LG HD tv allowed me to see things clearly, sharply, that I'd never seen before in the many, many viewings.  I love Prime!
B00CATSONE|2.0|This book was about 60% &#34;how to maximize your greatness&#34; and seriously lacked much info or insight into Tesla. Disappointing.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was a good book.  I was hoping for something more as it is suppose to be the last of the series.  Charmaine is a very good writer and I read everything that she writes by herself. I am not interested in short stories as you do not have enough time to develop the characters.  I hope she writes more on her other series.  Now about this book I do not want to spoil it it for people who haven't read this so I will say the story line with Sam was strange through most of the book and anticlimactic when you figured out why.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is great because it's fun and free my old.device broke down so I had to het a new device and I downloaded this new version on my old device it wouldn't let me upgrade the game so I'm not sure if it's going to be the same. All in all this is a great game that after about a year gets a bit tedious and boring.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has been a great improvement to my gaming days! But the newest update doesnt seem to work on kindle fire? (ver 0.7.1) Otherwise pretty awesome.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Great game! Very challenging, fun, and addictive! Levels could get pretty difficult at times but at the same time, manageable! Thank you!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|My oldest son had several favorite movies disappear so I came to Amazon for replacements!  Brand new, wrapped in cellophane, perfect!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am in grad school and this app has been a lifesaver. It has all of the functions of a traditional calculator and is easy to use. I have recommended this app to all of my friends and family that own a Kindle. One of the best apps I have downloaded.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Relationships. Isn't that what it's all about? Transcends time. All classes have problems. All looking for solutions. Great show. I love English TV!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I heard that the audio version with Tina reading it herself is much better.  All in all, good for a biography.
B002ZG994U|5.0|My oldest son had several favorite movies disappear so I came to Amazon for replacements!  Brand new, wrapped in cellophane, perfect!
B000IZA9NU|4.0|Fans of the series will like this.  Not the best but not as bad as talked about either.<br />A STNG Trekkie's movie.  I liked it.  I admit it was not the best but it makes me want more<br />Prime Universe movies or TV Shows.:)  I am not alone I know.  About to watch Nemesis now.<br />I also wish DS9 and Voyager and Enterprise crews could be in movies with them but hey<br />with time anomalies like the Nexus anything is possible.<br /><br />Cheers.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I'm not sure why everyone is complaining i'm stoked that the story hasn't ended after all isn't that life... problems just keep coming. i cant wait for more i want to see the wedding what happens with Cary and with Eva's parents i  for one thought it was great sylvia didn't rush to finish their story and i cant wait for More i just hope it doesn't take to long!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The treatment of human beings based on society and class is the theme of this book.  Love crosses over all lines proving that even hundreds of years ago your heart did not see the skin color, position in society or monetary worth of those you love.
B00006F2TV|5.0|My oldest son had several favorite movies disappear so I came to Amazon for replacements!  Brand new, wrapped in cellophane, perfect!
B000IZA9PI|5.0|Bad word of mouth.  IF you enjoyed the series see it for yourself.  You may enjoy it more than word of mouth<br />will tell you that you could.  I know I did.  Good thing is it pushes fans to the expanded universe stories<br />of the comics and books and Star Trek Online the Video Game.  To each their own opinion but as a Star Trek<br />fan, especially of the STTNG, DS9, and Voyager eras and the original series. I enjoyed it. Not everybody will.<br />But some will. See if you do.  I hope to see them again, as I am attached to the crews of this era.  Godspeed<br />and good voyages and thanks for the trip through my imagination.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a really fun game. :D Everyone needs to play this amazing game. They could not have made it better. :D
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very thought provoking.  Issues of making life choices, who has the right to make those choices, and how others are affected.  Book club discussion was at it's best for this one.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|this and hannibal are hands down the best thing to come along in some time. i am hooked.<br />i just hope the talent sticks around. there are some really good actors here i have never seen before.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out. Like others, I was disappointed that it wasn't the final book but wanted to give it a fair shot. Unfortunately the story continued to add concern on top of worry on top of crisis and nothing ever got resolved. I am all for a book having strife but this just went too far with no resolution to any of the problems. I was a huge Silvia day fan until this book. When a book series is drug out I lose interest and in this case I was looking forward to having closure and this book didn't even come close.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game, reminds me of Diablo but better, must download and pay! I'm paying on a kindle fire and it runs great, no force closes or errors like some of the other games on the market
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is basicly like the computer  version and it has really good quality. I have a kindle fire and it wont update to buckets!!!!! :(
B005C9YZKU|2.0|We are very disappointed that we didn't receive a limited edition copy of these movies we ordered. It's very disappointing.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book was somewhat helpful but very repetitive. It helps you understand your love language as well as your spouses.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a very fun and addictive game I play ally day and all night it's the BEST game ever!!!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I am enjoying  this game. I have sevrral Big Fish Games on my pc - I have the monthly membership - and this is the first for my Kindle.  Keep the fun coming.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Brilliant!! I am amazed at how Nalini Singh manages to hit the mark every time. It is a new dawn in the psy changeling world and I cannot wait to read the next installment. She has no equal in paranormal romance.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Lite reading of a young family raising a sibling out of a family trajety. This is a love story that takes your heart on a journey of faith and caring.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I love the epilogue!  I'm very sad that the trilogy had ended. Over all this book and the series was amazing
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Great book. I've learned a lot from it. I hope to keep the many messages in this book as I face challenges at work and at home. I appreciate the writer for putting this out there.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|it lookes really cool to play so I will down load it for my little sister she will love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this book.<br /><br />I typically will spend months on good book....just reading a few pages a day at lunch. I made time to read Wool.  It's so cliche, but this book is a real page turner....or would that be a page slider since I read it on my Kindle Fire? Either way, I was constantly and pleasantly surprised at all the plot twists and ever changing scenarios.<br /> Great character and plot development.  Hugh Howey is officially my new favorite author!!  Guess I'll have to update my Facebook profile page.<br /><br />  Thanks Hugh
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I pry myself away from the game to say that I think this is one of the best pinball games available! Works great on my Kindle Fire HD8.9.  It keeps asking me to rate the game...it was hard to stop playing long enough to do it. It is a freebie so you only get to use 1 table. I would gladly have paid for this.
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|It's so dumb it takes up almost 2 gigs for &quot;good graphics&quot; and they suck!<br />Swears to freakin mush!<br />SUCKS SO BAD!!
B0053IOZBE|5.0|Grandkids requested it, they loved it,  They like the books and the movies.  would recommend it for every one alike
0143122916|5.0|Very happy to receive this book after seeing a report on TV of the young man that escaped from Camp 14. It would be wonderful if the book prompts changes in the camps that so many people suffer from. Hard to understand how this is going on in this day & age.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I really like this game because all of the graphic. This game keep me on my game cause sometimes I am not.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book.......very current topic.  I think parents or teachers could easily find the premise believable.  if you like a plot twist at the end, this book is for you.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It was the only thing that you can't go on your friends kindle or your kindle and it won't let me update my minecraft world that's why I gave it 4 star's
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Lets the reader experience what the civil war stood for. hard to imagine what these poor people endured. Don't understand how one person can treat another in that manner
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I only have a couple books on this phone but also holds PDF files etc. works fine for my use
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the size for displaying to groups in the classroom.  It's an excellent calculator for the price of FREE!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is so very fun you can actually play it all day and never get bored. This is really worth your money if you ask me you should get it
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Another amazing book in the Psy/Changling books. Every book in these books is going to be a book you cannot put down!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Classic sudster - preposterous story lines but a great way to pass time while sick. My secret obsession which I'll never tell.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I never though a movie about a board game could be so amazing but they blew this one out of the water literally! It is a must see if you haven't seen it yet!
B000OCXIDK|3.0|I chose the book because I am anticipating the arrival of Girl With a Pearl Earring in Atlanta, and I thought reading the book might enhance the experience of seeing the lovely painting.  I was close to putting the book down by the time I was half way through it, because it was so boring. But boring was the life of a maid in those times, and so I continued reading.  It is well written for Young Adult or Middle School students in the later grade levels, but not for anyone who enjoys enriched vocabulary or a plot that requires concentration.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|If you are reading my review and have not watched the movie yet, I encourage you to go for it. It is one of those movies that leave you wanting more. Loved it.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|My Sony Blu-ray player (BDO-S590/BX59) sees this disc as a copy. The software that is a mandatory firmware download is the new Cinavia.com ant-copy protection, hidden in the audio track. The only way I can watch this film, is on an older DVD player. I bought this DVD as a excellent used disc. I assume at this writing that it is giving me a false positive reading.<br /><br />I have many other new DVD discs, and Bu-ray discs and never had this trouble before. If this is the way a Sony Blu-ray player is going to behave, I will switch back to my older Panasonic Blu-ray player, and give Sony players a negative review.<br /><br />Update June 12, 2013. After trying to play this new DVD, and on the fifth try, the Sony Blu-ray player finally let me watch it without muting the sound. The DVD played fine on my slightly older Panasonic Blu-ray player.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|First time I had seen this movie! So glad amazon has this available for prime members for free! So cute and funny, definitely a classic.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed with this &#34;trillagy&#34; that doesn't have an ending in site. The first two books were terrific but this one dragged on with whining and annoying characters. By the half way point I was so frustrated with Eva and her fickle commitment, I wanted Gideon to dump her. I don't remember the last time I felt so ripped off.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|It was too wordy and too predictable.  Too much like a soap opera.....no substance for me.  It was chosen for our book group because it was a best seller and respectable author!
B005DJREGQ|3.0|I found it interesting and may view more. I also found the idea of the non click format to almost predictable could cause loss of regular viewing.
0345529057|5.0|One of the greatest series ever! Well written and have a hard time not falling in love with the characters.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Be sure to watch the bonus sections.  It will help in understanding the movie better.  We watched the movie first.  Then we watched the credits at the end because it showed how many characters each actor played along with a picture of each character.  Next, we watch all of the bonus sections which helped in understanding the structure of the various stories in the movie.  Finally we watched the movie a second time.  As a result we gained a more in-depth understanding of the movie, each story, the characters, and the theme of the movie.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I rat this book four stars because it is so short you read it over and over and over again.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|You will like the 2 main characters - they're real and better'n you and me --  Better enough to<br />keep you reading.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|if you like/love first person shooters or any type of shooters its a very good mouse with the rapid fire button you can program to shoot as fast as you want. If you like/love massive multiplayer online roll playing games its very good with all the programable buttons for your spellls and stuff i would recommend this mouse to any PC gamer.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoyed a much different version of this game when I was a child. I love that the game that took so much imagination then, has been brought to life. it's fun for Everyone! and a tad addictive.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After waiting so long the ending was extremely disappointing. Not sure if I will read the next book. So bummed
B0002TJGQS|5.0|i love these. i needed them for my bathroom scale that hasnt worked in forever :] these are perfect! yay
B0019LY5IM|4.0|Ive been reviewing Lost season by season on Dvd , an must say it still  has me looking forward to the next episode , even though I seen them on tv as they aired. I must say season 1-3 , were the best , though seasons 4-5 were almost as good if not better . Its nice to watch theses shows again after 3 years , even though Im hooked on Breaking Bad  now ! If you dont own the sets , you can stream them nowdays on Amazon etc. Im just mid-way tthough season 5 an its nice to watch without those darn comercals in between . Hit play all an sit back . Its  great sometimes to look back .
B0051MKNV8|5.0|What a great movie. Bradley Cooper is a great actor and this movie highlights his acting talents. Definitely worth watching!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really  addictive and cool game i love it and my brother loves watching me play  he starts getting ecxited  when i play
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a really fun game that keeps you thinking.  i really like the dark scenes keeps your brain going.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Grew movie had hrray picture through this viewing technique.... would highly recommend. So glad to have found amazon instant video
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is addicted to this game...my wife and I also are addicted to it and argue what to do sometimes...lol
B00740FMTS|3.0|Book tells a part of the story that complements the pc game. Will give more background info of the story
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This is an awesome new cd from a time tested great band been a big fan for years definitely better than this pop crap nowadays . loved kingmaker and pretty much everything else and blackest crow
B009NY43NY|2.0|Loved the series but this was a failed attempt to wrap it all up in too neat of a bow.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It is really hard to be able to write this many books, so many pages each and still keep a good story going. I have read all five and it is really hard to wait for 3 more years. I'll have to keep living to finish the story!!!!!LOL
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is one one of those games that has no ending but is pretty good. I think it pretty good.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this book because it's a awesome.  The part that I like are the harder levels. My friend recommended me this game.  I love this game.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|liked them from the first time I saw them on the sing off, clearly the best group so not surprised they won. they are a very talented group and their album reflects that. great arrangements and performances.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I agree with the other reviewers, this was to be a trilogy, and the newest book feels like it is being stretched out to cover two more books.  Unfortunately that means superfluous and dragging details to fill pages.<br /><br />As upset as I am about the extension of this series, I still love the characters and I enjoyed the read.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This game is addicting and fun! Its also a nice time waster so if your looking for an app that is just easy and fun to play without having to sign up or anythig, but is also a good time waster, then this is the perfect app! I highly recommend this. It is soooo addicting and fun!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Tired of the travelogue nature of Dan's writing. His descriptions lack interest in his subject and fail to illicit a responce
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|just good variety of christmas (and advent) music, both secular and sacred, just enjoyable settings. and all nice length not brief
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so disappointed in the ending of this book. It just ENDED.  Umm what?  And the ending sucked.  Not really a cliff hanger it just ENDED.  I sat there dumb founded and kept thinking I missed something.  It was like she was tired and said I will just stop here and continue with another book.  WTH!  I'm serious there was no reason why it ended where it did.  For that matter she could have ended it several chapters earlier and gotten the same result.  The story was just so so and I felt like she was grasping for stuff to put in the book.  I was very disappointed in this one especially considering the price I paid for it.  I loved the first two and could not wait for the conclusion.  It was built up as a trilogy so I thought for sure we would get an ending to Eva and Gideon's story.  Boy was I wrong. If Ms. Day takes the story line where it is heading I seriously doubt I will read the other supposed two books.  I definitely won't pre-order it and I will wait until I read other Amazon readers reviews before I waste my money to purchase the next book or my time reading it for that matter.  What a let down after months of waiting.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Enjoyed but had a little trouble following--I would like to watch this again and pay closer attention.  Characters are unique and have strange interaction.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I adore the tales of Robin Hood, and own several versions. I think this one, with Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchette, is one of the best in that the story line might be a little closer to the truth of the Legend (but don't quote me--I'm not an expert on the subject).
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great and very ilustrative book, it opens our mind to the imagination Tesla inspired in every aspect of his life. So sad in my point of view that the only mistake in his ilustriuos career was proposing a free source of energy that could the pocket of \\"sort of important people and actual energy companies\\".
1897299214|5.0|Very sharp and ironic picture of North Korean society from the point of view of an animation professional spending a time working in the country.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't understand why we always get the updates so late. We usually get the updates 2 or 3 weeks after apple sometimes even a month.(0.5.0)<br /><br />  UPDATE QUICKER AMAZON PLZ!
B00004X10B|5.0|I purchased this bag about seven months ago.  I have travelled with bag and it fits comfortably in the overhead.  This camera bag has tons of room.

It becomes quite heavy when you load it down, but it is great for carrying on a trip.  I also carry a small bag with me and use it when I arrive at my destination.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I'm a patrol supervisor at a security company and this holds my tactical flashlight well and offers quick access for building checks.(I work nights), I also recommend this product to all of the officers I supervise. Nite Ize's awesome belt clip also fits securely on my 2 inch duty belt which was hard to find. I also purchased their sport case tone for my smartphone for the simple fact its hard to find holsters for many supplies that'll fit a duty rig, and again a purchased a sideways phone case for regular wear. The only problem with the light holder was that the one shipped to me had a loose connection to the clip so I will be returning it, it was a QC flaw, I went to Harbor Freight and bought a working one.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|What an amazing modern day crooner. I grew up listening to my grandfathers music and I rate Michael right up there with Sinatra, Bennett, Deano and all the other smooth voices of that era. My grandfather would have loved listening to Michaels music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game in this store in my opinion but there hasn't been a update for a year now overall a good game
0374214913|4.0|this was a really fun story to read ~ engaging and whimsical ... the perfect way to wind down the day before bed.  loved it!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I really, really liked this movie, and that surprised me. I'm not a big Quinton Tarantino fan (yeah, I know, you want to choke me)so yes, I was surprised. It IS bloody, gruesome and insulting but that's the way it truly was in that time, that location, sad to say. I wasn't wild about the very last line of the movie but hey, the rest of it was good.
B002R88G4U|5.0|I SIMPLY LOVED THIS BOOK _ IT MADE ME LAUGH AND CRY&#62; MY GRAN LIVED IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND WAS THERE DURING THE OCCUPATION SO IT BROUGHT HOME VERY MUCH WHAT THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH&#62;  SOMETHING WHICH I HAD NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD&#62;
B00D2K40WY|5.0|So much fun to do the make-up and to dress them up! I play it every day!!<br />I always enjoy it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I needed a backup alarm since my phone was not working all the time.  This one is simple, I like the display and am able to load different alarm settings for the week and weekends or just a special day.
B00B23O96A|3.0|not my favorite of his. A few country and reggae songs I'm not used to hearing from clapton.  Good for him for stretching his style.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I love all of their music but this one is absolutely the best! I am a huge fan of theirs and I just saw them in concert performing these doings and it was awesome as always. Buy this album!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book tremendously. Such a great book. Kept my interest the whole way. Characters were enjoyable and very well written.
030789701X|5.0|Being the huge Elder Scrolls fan that I am and having logged nearly 200 hours of play on the ESV I just had to have this guide once I seen it was coming out... so naturally I preordered it and got it yesterday from Amazon shipping.  The guide arrived in excellent shape and well packaged.  This strategy guide is enormous, lol... just a blast to read through and look at.  I rather enjoy strategy guides if there good just to read about the game and get insight on the walkthrough.  This guide here will occupy me for hours and make my gameplay all the more sweeter.  The sections and layout of the guide is excellent.  Having owned the prior guide version I had somewhat of an idea what to expect.  Pages and workmanship of this book are high quality, as mentioned in some other reviews the cover could have been a little better, but still its nice.  The cover has kind of a matte finish and is not glossy.  The added extras are a nice touch - the poster with Bethesda printed signatures and the included map is awesome and very large.  Just pick this guide up - if your reading this you know you want it :)
B00992CF6W|1.0|My bro has minecraft on his iPad and they have the update with realms! WHERE'S OUR UPDATE!!!!! Also y does does Apple get there UPDATE first. STEP UP YOUR GAME!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very very relaxing for a game, I could lie for hours and get lost in bliss and heaven with this game, the music is also meditative and helps to slip you into a state of peace in an instant.  No stress can stay around once you invoke the power of Quell. ;)
B004YW4L5K|3.0|I set the bar too high and it did not live up to it's Hugo/Nebula award winning billing. Too Bad.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|this book was a sad excuse for a story. I purchased it because of the first books and was sorely disappointed.I wouldn't be writing this if it was .99 cents, but it was not worth the price. I will not be buying the next book(s).
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is my favorite game i am crazy about it i can play it for hours but then gotta watch my YouTube both of those ar everything to me
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian Mcewan does a gret job of drawing the reader into characters and their situations. The book reads like a travelogue of London in the 60s and 70s, and the British intelligence community. A fun read and an intriguing tale.
B00821PCJS|5.0|The storylines intertwine with sci-fi story touching human emotion, family conflicts, and moral integrity. The grafics are good and the script believable.
B000FA5STS|4.0|David Balduchi is a fine storyteller. He must spend an enormous amount of time in his research. I really enjoy the questions he makes me think about every time I finish one of his novels. Is this posable? Where will technology take us? Will we revert back to postal after some incredible break in internet security?<br />Good stuff to ponder.<br />Mitch
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|My life partner had to practically tie me down and force me to watch this, but I was pleasantly surprised. The gothic feel of this series perfectly showcases what may just be the sexiest cannibal on tv. I am soooo crushing on the title character, btw.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Easy historical fiction just begging to be made into a mini series. Attention is kept and the characters are sufficiently rounded, but one of the central characters are villainous.
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|I've been waiting for this cd and I really do love the music. Very pleased with this Willpower cd. Love it!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Soooooo disappointed. I agree with others that this series is being drawn out for the money.  No other reasonable excuse.  This book was just getting started then it just ended with too many unknowns.  Again...like others have said...trilogy means three.  We waited long enough for the finale just to be let down by dragging the story into another book.  Nothing substantial even happened in this book to make it worth standing on its own.  It needed an ending but was cut off too soon.  This book is waaaaaay overpriced for its not so ending to a trilogy.  Boooooooooooooo.  So disappointed and not even wanting to read he next one for principal alone.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Amazing! I loved it .I cannot explain it .Just amazing .I want to read more and more every day.<br />Please write many more .
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It wasn't smart.  It wasn't cute.  It was dumb.  It was stupid.  Two hours of life wasted on total crap.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this one.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Casablanca is an amazing film. If you have never seen it before, keep something in mind. As modern audiences, we don't get the full impact of movie Nazi villains, because we know that they lose the war. When Casablanca was made, WE DID NOT KNOW THIS.<br />It was released only a month or so after Pearl Harbor, when victory was NOT assured.<br />The performances are insanely good. Subtle, rapid fire. There is a reason that Peter Lorre and Claude Rains and Sidney Greenstreet were in so many films. They were amazing performers. Bogart really shines in his maudlin moments, mixing self-pity and rage. Amazing. Amazing Amazing. :)
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|If you like gangster movies ....you must see !  I rented it  online and it was really clear and the sound was also good
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I would rate this ten stars if i could. Download this app if you like my little pony.<br />I give you good pony luck on this game.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I have not read to much on the behind the scenes of this film, but from watching it for the first time on Blu-ray, I am almost convinced that a large portion of this film was shot with a camcorder.  You can see the camera sway from side to side and in my opinion it really takes away from the shot when you can see the camera sway.<br /><br />The plot was weak but I still enjoyed the movie.  it is an action film and that means that its about the explosions and noise which ther eis plenty of.  The script is a little cheesy with a punch line delivered and then used a few scenes later and again later.....such as &#34;I'm on vacation.&#34;  They wore that line out and when you hear McClain say it...its the first you heard of him being on vacation.  Still worth watching.
B007IV1E2W|5.0|Dr. Who is one of the best series I have watched in a long time and now season 6 is so intense I love it
0345803485|5.0|Wow, the book is great.  I had heard so much about the book for so long, I had to read it for myself.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Plot builds really well and holds your interest with all the twists and turns. Reichs gives you all the clues but you never put them together until that split second before she reveals the bad guys.<br /><br />Enjoyed every word!
B004Z7AHTI|4.0|Excellent price and funny movie.  Kids take this series on vacation to watch in the car.  I love the these films and so does Steve Zahn.  This was the first movie in the series that I saw and I happened to watch it in a theater in Georgetown, KY.  Steve Zahn had popped in to catch the film too.  Well worth the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is very fun I love minecraft the only problem I have with it is I don't get my updates quick enough on my kindle fire, but other than that it is worth the money.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is GREAT &amp; is my &quot;go to&quot;  source for weather info.  We participate as a family in a lot of outdoor activities especially during the summer, so knowing whether there is a thunderstorm brewing is important to us.  It is easy to navigate, accurate, &amp; convenient.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|No matter what chapter you read, there are words of advice in addition to great stories.  I go back to it over and over when I need a pick me up.
B005LAIIA8|4.0|This was a good film to watch and the kids really liked it.  Plus it was a good buy with the combo pack we can watch the 3D in the movie room, the blu-ray in the family room and the kids can watch the DVD in their rooms.  This is before Disney decided to take advantage of the people that buy their products such as they are doing with the pending release of Oz the Great and Powerful.  When you buy that combo pack you cannot get the 3D version of the film you have to buy that separate.  The 3D version of the film is as much as the combo pack is and as much as the combo pack was when you did get everything.  Disney loyalty at its finest!  I can only imagine that we will see the same thing with Iron Man 3 and the Lone Ranger....just to get the ball rolling.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Amazing concert footage with an incredible light show. Great band and a great mix of classic Floyd. I do recommend you buy this over any other Pink Floyd video!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I love that my grandkids can accept pretend patients and perform medical procedures.  I highly recommend this game because they' keep coming back for more.
034580404X|1.0|Ana is an unlikable character. The author regularly tells us she is intelligent and mysterious and wonderful, but the character never shows that for herself!<br />It's a poorly written book, with very little research done. Not to mention, the relationship we're all supposed to love? Completely abusive! This has very little to do with BDSM (I'm a fan of it, but the books portray it poorly and Christian is a crappy Dom), and more to do with how controlling Christian is and how much he stalks her! He never lets her have time to think over her problems, he gets mad at her when she associates with any other male, there's even a scene where he rapes her!<br />I am constantly seeing reviews of women saying \\"this reminds me of my own abusive relationship,\\" but it's being advertised as a how-to guide, and men are being told this is what women want.<br />If you're looking for good erotica, there are plenty other series out there, avoid this one!
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|For the most part love what Disney churns out.  Something you can actually watch with the kids and not have to worry about what they are going to be subjected to.  Where Disney is making a big mistake is with their comb o packs.  First is the digital copy that is supposed to allow you to put the movie on your device and go.  Disney digital will work on the PC you download it to and is not able to be moved.  It is not Android friendly and it is not Ultra-Violet friendly.<br /><br />The second big issue is that the combo packs are now being split.  Typically there are different levels of combo packs offered, blu-ray and digital, blu-ray, dvd and digital, 3d blu-ray, blu-ray, dvd and digital.  These packages can vary by company.  Up until recently Disney has offered the 3D blu-ray, blu-ray, dvd and digital combo pack at a pretty decent price.  now with this film, Disney is splitting out the 3D and forcing you to buy it at full price as a stand alone disc leaving the combo pack with blu-ray, dvd and digital also at full retail price.  This is absolutely corporate greed by Disney.  It will be my last purchase if this is the business model that Disney is going to pursue.<br /><br />The movies are great but the practices are not.[[ASIN:B00C5W3SBE Oz the Great and Powerful (Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy)]]
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Outstanding from beginning to the end. One of the great Guitar players of today! Great supporting band with a fine selection of his own music with some Pink Floyd mixed in.
193700788X|1.0|Do not waste your money on this book.<br /><br />If you are a Sookie Stackhouse lover do not read this piece of merde!  Glad I borrowed the book, Mrs. Harris has the right to finish her story how she likes. Absolutely.  But this book is a slap in the face to all the fans who have read your stories for years.  I hope you have lots of $$$ because I will never pay on cent to read another of your books.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I've always felt that these books borrowed very heavily from the Shades of Grey series. After reading this book I feel like I'm just reading those books all over with new characters basically. Or sort of.<br /><br />It took me a long time to finish this book because it didn't keep my attention at all. I like sexuality in my books. I don't like my books to be straight up sexuality. I had a really hard time finding a story line to latch on to because every time something happened in the story line they had sex. Every conversation ended with sex or more often than not was interrupted by sex. Nothing was accomplished other than sex. It became tedious quickly for me and I started skipping vast sections of the book just trying to find some honest to goodness dialog or something other than sex. That was difficult to find.<br /><br />I'm not sure how one can draw out the story line of these two broken characters through many more books. I suspect all future books will be like this one and rely heavily on the mommy porn factor to sell. I probably won't be buying any more. I'm not seeing growth in the characters. Eva was unlikable this time around for me and Gideon is tough for me to like as well. Together I didn't feel really that great about them. In the last books I felt there was some movement in resolving their respective issues. Now I feel like they're just going to have lots of sex and wallow in their individual trauma and misery.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Not a bad movie for the comeback film for Arnie.  It entertaining and fun to watch especially if you like action movies.  Probably not going to be a classic but still worth the watch. At the price I bought it for it still a better deal than the matinee and a pop.  Shipping was on time and the lowest price guarantee gave me the best deal available.
B0045DO8II|5.0|What more needs to be said. This music jams from the beginning to the end. I highly recommend this cd to anybody who loves a guitar army.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Bought Weaphones for my son, and was very excited to see that this came out. He's been anticipating it for a while. He absolutely loves the app and guns themselves. He hopes for updates to rapidly come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great I never had to download it or uninstall it. Anyone who doesn't have this game they need to get it.I love this game.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book engaged me. It made me think. Very entertaining. A must read. Dan Brown is sooo persuasive; so very convincing.....
B00CH87HF4|4.0|excellent game a lot of fun<br />be a lot better if developer doesn't keep trying to get players to spend there money
B005MMJ84K|5.0|this book is a real page-turner. i couldnt stop reading! im looking forward to reading the other books in this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an aside.game that never will get old with me only because it has a new place every mouth but the coin value should go up
B000SEFM6K|3.0|The writer creates a brooding atmosphere and a lost place in time.  Clever with an amazing insight into the life of women during the time period.
B00023B1AS|5.0|PQ is pretty good, especially for a DVD produced so long ago; but the big thumbs up goes to the audio quality. the sound is full & rich along all channels, and if u are lucky enuff to play this disc in your car, it's a beast.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, lots of action, kept me wondering what's going to happen next. I'll be reading more from this author.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's awesome and addictive, you will most likely spend many hours playing it, It can and irritate you. Good Luck
0525952926|4.0|A lot of attention to personal minutia of the characters at the expense of reporting on major events. Thought  the &#34;Fall of Gaints&#34; was much better,  Looking forward to the next episode however.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app for my Kindle fire HD does exactly what you need it to do. Really simple to understand and great idea to give you several times for battery life depending on what you want to use the device for.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love this CD!! I played it for my high school kids during certain class times and they LOVED it, too!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie has some flaws, but I still can't help but like it. I love R's inner monologues the best, so much so that I am definitely going to read the book (which I've heard has a different ending). Repeated viewings of this also made me pay more attention to the music. This movie has a really solid soundtrack. So, this film won't change your life but is a great way to spend a spare afternoon.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|totally enchanting from beginning to end -- I love the artwork!<br />I only wish the story could be longer - but I like how you can go back to find all stars
B00992CF6W|5.0|I honestly love to play this game during my free time, but I noticed that updates come later than an Apple device. My friend got the 0.7.0 update while I still have to wait for it!
B00CHMBQRA|2.0|If \\"Erased\\" had been made 30 years ago it might have seemed a novel thriller but in the wake of what's come before, this thriller starring Aaron Eckhart leaves the same light lingering impression as a mistake erased from a piece of paper. \\"Erased\\" is little more than \\"Taken\\" with a bit of \\"Safe House\\" and other spy thrillers thrown into the mix and as derivative as they come.<br /><br />Eckhart plays Ben Logan a former CIA operative and killer who has \\"retired\\" working now as a security consultant in Antwerp. He has his daughter Amy (Liana Liberato) living with him after the death of his ex-wife. It's a somewhat uneasy existence as the two are still working out their differences and how to live together peacefully. One morning Logan goes into work to discover that his division has never existed; what's more all of his co-workers are in the morgue. Suddenly, Logan and his daughter are on the run themselves with an assassin on their trail and Ben must piece together what happened and who is behind the conspiracy to erase his existance.<br /><br />Eckhart makes a fine action thriller hero and is a terrific actor. I can only suspect that the timing of the project, the chance to shoot overseas and have a vacation and the price was right. Actors, after all, have to (and like to) work and I'm sure that \\"Erased\\" looked fine on paper. It is a decent thriller it's just not something we haven't seen a dozen times before and done better on a larger budget.<br /><br />The film is ably directed by Phillip Stoizi and the screenplay by Arash Amel (who just completed scripting the sequel to [[ASIN:B0013FBS20 I Am Legend [Blu-ray]]]) certainly does a good job of developing the father-daughter relationship between the two main characters. Where the film falls down is in the lack of originality of its execution as well as the twist and turns of the plot.<br /><br />What makes \\"Erased\\" memorable is Eckhart's dependable performance as an actor everything else is recycled and derivative from better made films.rom better made films.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Loved the originality of this whimsical book. Great reading, only criticism, not fond of the ending. Otherwise would highly recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was an ok book, I read it and finished it in about four days. I found it to bee rather predictable.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great read fills in what the movie or play has left out. Great moral story and can be applied to ones life.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|She's baacck!!!!!  Agnetha's voice is as young and pure as ever.  It's really hard to pick a favorite song on the album because they are all worthy of being a single release.  There are no fillers on this album.  The songs are more mature with a nostalgic tone but her voice is still in control of telling the story of each song.  Agnetha still hits the high notes but has a better sense of portraying a delicate lost soul at times. For all of us ABBA fans, this album more than makes up for not having an ABBA reunion.  Jorgen Elofsson is a master tunesmith and producer.  I'm certainly a new fan of his for bringing Agnetha back to us!!!  Enjoy! and Thanks Agnetha for giving us such a wonderful album!!!
B000T46O52|5.0|Accurately portrays the attitudes of the early 90's, many of which continue today. The young Hanks and Washington are both terrific. Highly recommend!
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I have read through page 19, and am now at page 20 and i don't know what language the text is in, but it is NOT English. Skipping forward to page 21 I again see Endless text, but what am I missing story wise on that untranslated page??????????????????????
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Its cool and all and helpful if u need to charge your tablet and need the percentage and yea it's alright
B00BESNKB8|1.0|I like Martial arts movies.<br />I like Quentin Tarantino movies.<br />I don't know what this was, other than unwatchable.<br />It really is insultingly dumb and I don't know what Lucy Liu or Russell Crowe were thinking getting involved in it.<br />It does not deserve even one star.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|For all sci-fi fans that are tired of the captain being the lead, the story of how the bulk of the crew lives, with a twist. Very enjoyable and I found myself laughing aloud at times. I only wish there were more of it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I feel this app to be very useful, although there is always something extra you want to do and are unable to do so. But it is fine and I recommend it.
B00C0IYPRY|4.0|Gotta love Patrick Dempsey. And the young girl was great in delivering zingers. Cute, classic tale. Just don't watch around children--profanity and a sexual scene in the car.
0446582778|4.0|This entry in the Bosch series continues the theme well. Harry Bosch has no illusions about anyone's altruism or goodness, and when a black attorney who sued cops all the time is killed, plenty of people have a motive. Connelly is an excellent writer in the \\"noir\\" tradition, and the book is hard to put down. However, Connelly did not resist the temptation to create an excessive number of subplots, not all of which are necessary to his conclusion. In this way, the novel is weightier and more complicated than it had to be.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Among all three books, I enjoyed this second book and call it the best. About the past of Lisbeth, her feelings to Mikael, and the Millenium's future were well described. Another breath-taking book. Lisbeth, you are a great heroin. You have no trusted friends, but you are such a couragoues and clever woman! People can't take eyes from you.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I enjoyed Oblivion thoroughly, and consider it to be a good SCI-FI film.  Yes, It takes some concepts from numerous other movies and combines them into one new work.  No, it is not perfect by any means, but it was very entertaining if you are capable of just watching a film without trying to dissect every aspect of it!!!  Ton Cruise gave his usual great performance, and Morgan Freeman could recite the dictionary and make it entertaining!!!  You will see many different SCIFI films influences, but should be entertained nonetheless!!!
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Nice realistic movie. Ethan Hawke and the young lady are great in this movie. Sharing their time, ideas and extensive conversations makes for a great trip.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|If you love Pride & Prejudice (BBC 1995), you will most definitely love this as well.  I don't want to give to much away by giving a play-by-play of the entire story.  I must say though that Richard Armitage is an amazing actor.  He can say so much without actually speaking a word sometimes.
B007SGM084|1.0|The author should have made the three books in one! Too long for a story that doesn't have any big plot. A dark secret of Chirstian Grey? Not that special. The way Christian fell in love with Ana? I don't see how attractive she was. Relationship with Chistian Grey and Mrs. Robinson? Described too light. And Jack Hyde. He could be a key person to twist a story in a good way and shadowed the relationship of Christian and Ana, but the author did not have skill and failed to make Jack an outstanding villain but a jerk. I mostly enjoyed reading this trilogy's review. And I think my posting would make the reviewers enjoy to read another critical review for this trilogy.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Everyone should read this book for the insight it gives to a very difficult time in the history of the world. The story is compelling but the way it is written, especially in the first few chapters, makes it hard to get into. It is well worth the effort. Stick with it!
0811869261|5.0|Besides the author is our baby's favorite illustrator (we figured that out by randomly offering her all kinds of books since she was 2 months old) - this is so interesting to look at, and that rich & detailed illustrations give me a lot of material to talk to my 9-month-old daughter... I guess when she is ready for stickers at cca 2 y old - she'd be thrilled to find out this book contains that too, and when she starts to read - easy & short texts are good for a start! It's so funny when I look at my childhood books - and the bookmarks left after every 2 lines LOL Because it was too much for me to read all at once! But here the texts are approximately 2 lines each, but a lot of them, so the girl can enjoy the accomplishment of being able to read what some animal has said, and not feeling constantly behind the story because she needs to read a ton to understand something!
B0068THAGY|4.0|It's a little cheesy but very enjoyable. It keeps you on the edge of your seat after a lengthy beginning.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|So far so good charging my Kindle and I also like the fact the cord is longer than the original charger.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|The movie is amazing but I ordered this as a gift for someone's birthday and the item never arrived. Amazon told me it was delivered and signed for but I called my friend and they said nothing came. I paid big bucks for this to be 2 discs and blu-ray plus wrapped as a gift. I want my $30 back!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Although the book seem like it was more of a bridge to gap the spaces between book 2 and 4. it wasn't that bad to read but maybe should have just merged this with book 4 for a bigger book. the ending really wasn't an ending it was like the rest of my book had been torn off and missing, no closure nothing just OK this is where you stop. Hoping for a short story to finish this up or a fast release of the next book.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Wish I coud rate it, was looking fwd to it, but was unable to stream this one, Amzon tech not sure why, good luck to others, maybe I try again another day
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The game is beauty, full of colors and lovely characters, easy to play, and so addictive. The kids enjoy it.
0812550706|4.0|It's a good read. I'm not into science fiction at all and only bought it for school but it was pretty good for a boring space book (what I call all science fiction books.) So, if I liked it, you'll like it.
B000002J1O|5.0|This was not only the first Genesis album I heard in its entirety, but also the first prog album I heard from any band from that strange musical period of the late 60s and early 70s. From where I am standing as a self-initiated neophyte, which is not much, but upon which nevertheless I make my recommendation, this is as good an album as any to start with. Immerse yourself here, and you will want more.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I'm a romance junkie and I keep looking to other authors for a fix, but I should know better. Nalini Singh is the Queen of Romance. There is no other romance author that can create such an alluring story filled with just the right amount intrigue and romance. I bow down to Ms. Singh. The greedy junkie that I am, I cannot wait for her next Psy/Changeling book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Savored watching it over a couple of weeks because I knew it would be next year before I got more for my DA addiction.  Can't wait for the next season.  So well done and so British.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Wonderful screen display and representation of Jane Austen's classic. Characters very well played. The blue ray makes it even better to watch
B009MYARIK|4.0|Wedding Night was enjoyable enough to read. I could easily put it down and pick it back up where I left off a few days later. The story was typical Sophie Kinsella romantic comedy but wasn't her best work (nothing really compares to Shopaholic). Was it worth the money? I think so, but then again what true fan would say otherwise?
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|The previous book should have been the last. I've loved this series, it's funny and easy to read.This book seemed mainly about tying up all the loose ends; and everything worked out very nicely.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|It could of been better. I couldn't see the movie when it went to the dark scenes. The parts I did see it was okay but the movie was slow to get to the point of the movie.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Loved it.  Every blood dripping minute was filled with humor, irony, sadness, and triumph and truth. A definite must see.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|While the first few chapters take some persistence to get through, King takes you into the mysterious but somehow plausible world of time travel, keeping you so engrossed in the characters and the paradoxes that you are compelled to not put it down. Quite long but worth the read. Thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I'm not a huge King fan because he normally scares me out of my wits. I have a whole new appreciation.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A wonderfully directed story that brought full attention to belief in God and a strong will and desire to survive.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|Sorry, it fell far too short.  The plot and screenplay didn't match the talent of cast and was filled with unanswered questions.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the series and yes the ending...not to mention the longggg wait..are somewhat annoying...but really I'm not ready to let ol Gideon go. All the people unhappy with more story,I get that but why are you in a hurry to end a good thing?? Im sure glad to have more coming. Bring it on Sylvia!  But maybe a little faster next time huh??
B002OHB3IK|4.0|The price is a very good bargain for this album on vinyl.<br />The records sound pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.<br />It comes with a neato poster of the lyrics. Problem is, it's double sided, so if you wanna put it up on your wall, you'll have to choose which side. But that's not that big of a problem.<br />Still, very good price for a double LP.<br />I doubt you'll be dissatisfied.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Cool book it's so awesome I read all of the diary of a wimpy kid books we e. E e
B001BANK32|5.0|Although the movie is one of my favorites, the book gives so much more background about the Torrence's.  That really makes a difference. If by some weird chance you haven't seen the movie yet read the book first. You get the best of both worlds then!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|whew...I need a minute. HOLY SHEET!!!! I am currently kinda speechless. I do not believe 5 stars is enough but I am truly biased because Gideon and Eva have rocked me dumb. I did not think I could possibly love a book couple this much and although there is happiness toward the end...it is so not over with these two. So many questions, so many need to know facts, and so much more needs to come from this!<br /><br />Sylvia Day I love you...but I hate you...you know what I mean? You took my entire day and just made everything trivial in comparison to this book, lol! You are truly gifted in your ability to weave a suspenseful tale into this hot romance. I am so in love with Gideon Cross and his ridiculously sexy badass uber alpha maleness, but I love Eva just as much. She was amazing in this book. She is so smart, so sassy, and so possessive but awesome about it...I mean wow \\"I have 30 minutes that I would rather spend F**** you than talking about your ex!\\" You go girl! For once a bad-ass chick to match her bad-ass lover with every step.<br /><br />I refuse to really delve into this story with details because I hate when I read spoilers. Just know that this book 3 in the Crossfire Series does not disappoint. My only complaint is \\"MORE\\"...there has to be so much more to come of this. I would not call this a cliffhanger per se, but I do need a bit more closure. I got the feeling that Eva was just about to embark on something huge when the last period of the page appeared! Overall, this is an amazing love story filled with character transformation for the better, secondary characters that take on a life of their own-yet play huge roles in Gideon and Eva's lives, and off the charts sex that only Gideon and Eva could do so well! I am still smiling 3 hours later...ummm, yep I will be having book hangover for a while with this one!
B002PL5GTC|5.0|This compilation sounds simply exquisite on vinyl! Perfect sounds on every song. When I put the needle on side 1, and I heard the riff of &#34;All My Life&#34; come out of that record with a perfect sound, I knew it was gonna be good.<br />This is something most definitely worth getting.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|This movie is a love story that brings a person from the past & a person from the future who write to each other through a mailbox at the same lake house and they meet on a certain date and fall in love. Keanu reeves and Sandra bullock are awesome I movies together. One of the best movies I have seen.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is very good in my opinion. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading. A true look at what few do to protect our county.
B00ATX7FLA|5.0|Neat collector's item that has very few pieces and looks really cool when put together. My husband and I have all 12 in the Buildable Galaxy series and we have since made a mobile out of all the planets and we display all the ships/pilots on a shelf.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game so much! If you're a huge angry birds fan, this is a game for you! Play ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a wonderful book! Sexy, lustful and exciting! Thoroughly enjoyed every word written! Can not wait to start the next book.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Really gets to the heart of what's important in your personal and business life.  Real practical advice that can be applied right now.. Highly recommend!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Imagine a tale about a quadriplegic and his caretaker that isn't a downer. Based on a true story, this French film has moments of hilarity, heart-wrenching and heartwarming authenticity, and--best of all--viewers get to celebrate as both characters triumph over adversity.
B004WR125O|3.0|I really think I paid too much for this wireless dongle but unfortunately is the only one that will work with my specific Onkyo network receiver.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Saying Boz is back wouldn't be right since he never left, but it's classic Boz at his best.<br />Excellent arrangements.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I got more into this book as I went along but I think I liked Rachel as a main character better than Darcy. But I'm still glad I read it to understand both sides of the story!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|You want a great and durable watch?  You want a watch that is durable?  You want a real mechanical watch?  This is the watch for you.  I have worn this watch to work in dusty and rough environments-no issues.  I wore this watch while swimming in the Gulf of Mexico-no leaks or performance issues.  The crystal is very tough and scratch-resistant.  Here's the thing: THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC WINDING WATCH!  It isn't digital.  It doesn't have a battery!  It will stop working because you don't wear it for a couple of days!  Be educated about this watch before you buy!  It is a 21 jewel watch which means the second-hand action is very smooth.  No loud ticking like on quartz movement watches.  If the watch stops working, follow the directions listed in the owner's manual or just simply shake it a few times to get it running, set the time and put it on.  There ya go.<br />I have two Seiko 5's  Both are excellent timepieces.  Don't be too snobby about the Malaysian.  It works fine.  Sure the Japanese movement is great and if you are lucky, you might accidentally get one.  Otherwise, the Malaysian movement is just fine.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this watch for everyday or dress usage.  Buy this watch
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is the best crafted novel I've read in several years.  The nested stories create a narrative complexity that allows transcendent human truths to emerge.  The plots are entertaining, the characters engaging and the dialogue clever.  I highly recommend this book.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|I rate this book as ok = average. The writing style is unique and, at times, captivating for the imagination, however the overall story flow is unsatisfactory. I found the initial setup very intriguing - Pi's childhood living in a zoo and his religious yearnings - but this was entirely let down by the remainder of the book. In the end, the book answers no meaningful questions, and this undermines any themes Yann Martel was weaving into the book.<br /><br />In conclusion, an interesting idea executed in an average way.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|I have loved  everything Brian has put out. This just provided the listener what goes into a show and it was outstanding.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|The insights from this book are very practical. Many good case studies help walk you through basic negotiations. The modern updates to include email and text messages mentioned help keep the book more relevant.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Let's start with the positive - this would be a good book club selection. I found myself discussing the main moral dilemma with many of my friends. Would you cover up a murder your child was suspected of committing? It's not like this topic has never come up in other movies or TV shows, but it is done in an interesting way in this book.  Both parents deal with the accusation that their son committed murder in different ways. As a DA, the narrator and father is man who is very good at sticking to facts and keeping his feelings removed, allowing him to explore moral ambiguities for the sake of protecting his son. His son in not a likeable character, which complicates the story even more for the reader because all of the evidence points to the son and it is quite certain that both parents believe he did it, even though they never ask the son. Although some reviewers felt the trial dragged on, I liked it and found the reveals both in and outside of the courtroom fun and interesting.  The whole book held my interest and I was really intrigued to find out how the trial ended...but then it took a strange twist. I did not appreciate the events in the last 50 pages or so. I think he could have used them, but the incidents needed to be developed better. The last part was so rushed that it was almost unbelievable.  I can't believe an editor didn't tell him this. The first ¾ of the book was just great.  A very unique component of the book is that you never really know for sure what anyone, including the narrator, is really thinking. I had fun thinking about the themes and discussing them with people so I think it would be a great book club selection but I overall did not love the book because of the rushed ending that did not do justice to an otherwise compelling story.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Very heart warming. Loved how they portrayed all the characters from our childhoods and the way it portrayed belief in the characters themselves.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Enjoy this type of game...makes you think.  Great for playing while waiting in a doctor's office or for someone to arrive.
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|This is a nice case, i like the fact that you can get different color shells to go on it, I just wish it fit a little tighter around the top parameter.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but didn't want to pay theater prices.  So now that I waited I wish I had seen it in the theater!  Very cool movie, good graphics, story line is great.  Over all really good movie!  Will be watching this more than once.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Great film... Never expected what happened. Helen Hunt does a great job but is she ever brave with the nude scenes... But perfect body for the part!
B00821OX98|5.0|...shows I've watched in a while; grated some moments are kinda horrible. My friend recommended this show to me, and I couldn't be happier that she did.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|I like Jeffrey Archer's writing, it is a bit frustrating the way he ends a book and then having to wait a year or longer for the follow-up, I suppose that is how he makes money.  But a good read.
B008602KQI|1.0|its bad, lol its so bad only gud part was gayle bcause hes so good lol omg i love moviy :>
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app helps me with clarity and I love it! Good for people who can't standard small buttons like me!
B0085YOD1A|2.0|It drains the battery and takes space in the notification bar. I wouldn't suggest to get it. I used it for a full day and I'm un installing it. Good luck
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Like all JA books, a good read, cannot wait for the next novel.  Is a typical &#34;cannot but down&#34; book!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire; I love being able to play this game on the road without having to pull out my laptop.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|This was an excellent version of the movie, Cruise  is a very convincing Jack Reacher.  The man, who since he left the military had no home.  He always can find danger and excitement no matter where he goes.
0385528752|5.0|My problem with most books like this are that they tend to be dry and tough to read (at least they are for me). This book kept me interested because it makes valuable points in interesting ways through true stories and studies while being light-hearted and entertaining. It offers practical advise on how to change your own habits, other people's actions, and even entire community's culture. According to the Heath brothers (Chip and Dan) each of these groups of people change with basically the same process. Great for people interested in breaking personal habits, helping others around them such as their family or business unit move in a new direction, or even if you simply want to change the world. One of my favorite new reads, and a book I plan to read over and over again.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I enjoyed reading about a time long past. The history of a family and their problems of living in the 14th century was interesting. Well written.
B00AK57N00|2.0|I played the game twice on my kindle and it started to lag really bad. idk how or why games that are this basic and simple lag like they do. other than that it was a cute addictive time killer.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|a little lengthy at times but worth the read. you never quite know what to expect. great storytelling with depth and breadth!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a great animated film that adults and kids enjoy! Gru definitely puts the fun in dysfunctional in his quest to reach his career goal.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I rented this movie and made sure to watch it twice. It was a really good movie and was unexpected. I hate when movies are predictable and this one was not. I will be buying it when it comes out on DVD
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched 7 episodes of the 3rd season of Downton Abbey on my kindle fire on a long cross-country flight (to and from Los Angeles).  Definitely the best season of Downton yet!  The story helped this nervous-flier.a lot!  Enjoy!
859037985X|4.0|Most parts of this book are great, some areas really could use some work.<br />Regardless, if you only buy one book on Lua, this is the one to have.
B000FS9FC6|1.0|This over-hyped film's script is pathetic, characters routinely delivering ridiculous lines at key moments in the predictable plot. The message is nothing more than pro-homosexual propaganda thinly disguised as a warning against totalitarianism, a truly tired theme. The pampered princess, Ms. Portman, is a laughable excuse for an \\"actress.\\" She never bothered to understand, much less immerse herself, in the character. Portman resembles a bored coed half-heartedly scuffling from scene to scene. Blech!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|If you buy the CD you automatically get the digital download, and the total cost is still only $10.59 with tax.  So its a better deal to just get the CD as long as you have prime and free shipping.  IDK about you who don't have prime.<br />Heck, ill give the CD away brand new to my brother for his birthday or something like that. 2 for 1!<br />(FYI - i selected the snail mail shipping even though I have prime b/c I don't need the CD fast - and if I save amazon a little bit of money, then it should help keep prime membership cost lower than if I am getting 2 day shipping on everything even though it makes no difference to me)<br /><br />We all live downstream.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|perfect game for me I finally found a game I love the chanallage is the best part way cant every game be this good
B0063M22QO|3.0|Though the tiles are easily paired and reduced in the puzzles, and the graphics are competent, the challenge is taken away by the option to scramble remaining tiles when no pairs remain in the existing configuration.  Other versions of this game terminate if you are left with no further pairs to match. So using the rescramble option, you end up solving every puzzle game.  I think it would be more challenging if you had to start over with the same tile configuration until you were able to remove all the tiles to win.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This CD has many of the songs on it that I like to listen to in my car.  The outer cover is different than pictured.
0307200477|5.0|I bought Pat the Bunny Deluxe Edition for my friend's baby shower.  I remember my children used to read and play with it when they were small.  The new edition has more pages and a bit larger than the original version.  It's a great gift and I highly recommend it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved the books so much more than I loved the movies ! Stephanie Meyer is a Great writer and this is coming from someone who does not love to read.  ALL my life I have been visual and auditory... but when reading, when I had to, those traits made my reading that much more clearer because I could SEE and HEAR  what I was reading! I have a great,even vivid imagination...and that helps me enjoy reading more now as an adult... kinda wish I had developed this knowledge earlier in life...looking forward to doing some more reading...lol
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I saw Silver Linings Playbook and liked the story so I decided to read the book. They had the same basic premiss but were very different. The book was much more twisted. Pat and especially Patrick (Pat's father) were darker in the book. The dance off was nothing like the movie portrayed. Although very different, I enjoyed the character development of Pat, Tiffany, the mom and psychologist Cliff. Good (not great) book. Easy read with some dark spots and some funny spots.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Female lead was a little corny. Hope she is not like that in real life. Girl from homeland should play this role. Wood have nailed it!
B00993I6D2|5.0|Seems like we are almost there. Great movie for everyone to watch, will get you thinking about what is happening today.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A good read about the dirty pool of Edison and Morgan (did not read about it in the history books at all).
B004WOH19S|4.0|An absorbing plot by the author, Jeffrey Archer. I enjoyed the book, the characters were different and I was reluctant to put it down but was also absorbed in the plot.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was just bad.  I don't even care that there are more books to come because I have no desire to read them. What's with all the scattered storylines?  Drama everywhere but no rhyme or reason to anything!  Book was just boring and ridiculous waste of time to read.  So disappointed!  Certainly did not leave me wanting more of this nonsense much less more of the author. One star is too generous. Series has ended for me.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Those used to the new effects of the big budget movies might not understand the appeal, but these were groundbreaking episodes.
B00CW665VI|3.0|This story was hot at first. I loved drew...it was refreshing to read something from a guy's point of view. Spoiler alert. But then it became such a predictable book about a guy meeting a girl and of course this girl is the most beautiful and they live happily ever after having the most wonderful sex ever, all the time. This is me wretching. Is there a book out there with a real ending? I am so tired of these fairy tales.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I was searching for a long time for a case for my Kindle Fire, I really like this one a lot it's quilted inside to protect the Kindle.  The quality and price are excellent.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it would have more of a selection of material colors and designs.  I'm really happy with this purchase.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|I enjoy the &quot;tree&quot; ranking system and i look forward to future games. Thanks! I am not very far yet but so far I'm enjoying re playing previous maps, which there are a lot.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great but when is th  Update that is for Apple come out for kindle? You know with the buckets and all plus add hunger
0385341008|5.0|I borrowed this from Library-on-the-Go and liked it so much that I wanted a copy to read again and to loan to friends.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Deep, thoughtful story of a father trying to understand his son.  Is he a serial killer?  Is he an innocent caught up in being in the wrong time & wrong place.  The marriage on the line as the parents struggle to come to terms with their difficult to understand teen.  The reader is left guessing as to what really happened.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I was interested in buying this product but wasn't sure which version to buy because I want to use it on both my iPhone and MacBook. I emailed the customer service email address on their website twice, with absolutely no response. I don't think I'll be buying it after all.
B0080M3OGW|3.0|DECENT MOVIE.  BUT THE STORY LINE IS SLOWWWWWW, AND DRAGS ON AND ON.  WOULD BE BETTER IF MUCH MORE LIVELY.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I chose this rating because I was riveted the whole time.  I watched the sad and lonely man develop relationships with the men he was with all through the thrill packed movie.  And then it came right down to the two alpha males and you knew which had to win, but you knew he was going to go away with a lot of scars and pains and would always remember he'd been in the fight of his life.  It's a bit gory and bloody, but it's exciting.<br /><br />I'd recommend it, yes.
B00847KFDS|4.0|This is a stellar \\"concept\\" album that showcases not only the writing, singing and guitar-playing abilities of a living legend, but also his music's wide-ranging appeal and inspiration across the rock-and-country landscape. Despite a few \\"rock snob\\" reviews that seem unaware of John Fogerty's past forays into the country sound (see, for example, 1997's Blue Moon Swamp and 2009's The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again), the fact is that from the very beginning the Creedance sound was an altogether unique blend of rock and country influences. This album opens with the rock anthem \\"Fortunate Son,\\" a hard-edged version on which Fogerty teams with the Foo Fighters. One knock against it is that it fails to match Bob Seger's cover, which concluded his Like a Rock album way back in 1986 -- an unfortunate though unavoidable point of comparison, given that Seger also appears on track 11 of Wrote a Song For Everyone. That Seger's slowed-down version of \\"Who'll Stop the Rain,\\" with its acoustic guitar and piano accompaniment, stands out as a notable highlight here also suggests that Dave Grohl's vocals on \\"Fortunate Son\\" sound a bit thin and strained, though certainly loud.<br /><br />Track 2 cuts immediately to the country side of things with Keith Urban supplying vocals and banjo on \\"Almost Saturday Night,\\" another highlight of the album. Other country artists making appearances with Fogerty are Alan Jackson (\\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\\"), Miranda Lambert (\\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\"), Brad Paisley (\\"Hot Rod Heart\\") and the Zac Brown Band (\\"Bad Moon Rising\\"). Lambert's vocals may strike some Fogerty fans as a tad too twangy, and I just don't get Tom Morello's weird guitar solo at the end. Jackson comes off as serviceable if slightly uninspired, as does Paisley's vocals. But a major highlight of the album is the guitar back-and-forth solo on \\"Hot Rod Heart\\" between Paisley and Fogerty (the credits note that Paisley plays GUITAR!!!) ... and it is indeed worth all caps and three exclamation marks.<br /><br />Kid Rock's contributions to \\"Born on the Bayou\\" are outstanding, as are Jennifer Hudson's on \\"Proud Mary,\\" never mind the Rolling Stone review. The two new Fogerty songs are hit and miss: \\"Mystic Highway\\" (hit) and \\"Train of Fools\\" (miss). All in all, this is a very solid re-working of classic material. None of it will replace the iconic sounds of the originals, but music fans -- and certainly Fogerty fans -- should enjoy most of the tracks.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Rented for vacay trip and thought movie was a comedy, it is not. Its a thought provoking movie about mental illness, family and dealing with both. Enjoyed the movie anyway.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|One of the best apps that I have used, put it on as a short cut and save time without requiring you to go through the settings and checking.  Really like this app.
B00821OX98|4.0|Excellent Show!  Well acted with good characters.  It's a little like &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; but with aliens.  The aliens are appropriately menacing.  We love it because it takes place where we live in N. Central Massachusetts.  There are a lot of local references if you live in Mass.  The show is very well done, with great special effects.  But the main draw is that it has interesting characters who you grow to like and you care about what will to happen to them.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have loved Rod Stewart for years and years.  I love anything and everything he sings.  I am so happy he's made this new album.  His voice is outstanding and the songs he's written are from the heart.  I'm now a &#34;Maggie Mae&#34; totally in love with Rod.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Who knew that a Zombie could make u feel warm and fuzzy inside?.. love R! The book was awesome and the movie did not disappoint!!!! Wanna watch it again!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I have other battery apps, I have to say that this one seems to work the best. Good interface. Let's you know how much time you have remaining say watching video or surfing the Internet.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! The first levels are easy and make you feel that you are so smart. Then you hit the higher levels and it really makes you start using your brain. Recommend highly!
B007DIQC90|5.0|What a surprise that this album is as wonderful as it is.  I had heard one song by OMAM when I bought this album.  Every song on it is great.  I could not be happier with my choice.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i love this app! great graphics cute dragon. love it<br />U buy stuff build  stuff. get coins and new higher  levels<br />all free
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great free app that allows you to save something on your computer and access it on your phone or kindle or whatever.  I also use the livescribe pen and paper so what I write is saved too.
0812550706|5.0|This book was really good.  Interesting story, good plot, and great surprise at the ending!  I recommend it to all ages!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I really like Lady Antebellum and this album does not disappoint.  I liked &#34;Own the Night&#34; better but &#34;Golden&#34; is starting to grow on me.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Khalid Hosseini's writing is captivating! I could not stop reading as each chapter left me aching for more. Great book. Now, I've started And The Mountains Echoed.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|I am still trying to sneak in listens between breaks in Sesame Street music, but so far so a good new album from Depeche Mode
B00BI4BA4C|5.0|How good do you want it?  This is classic Dr Feelgood.  Wilko was and still is a god!  Saw him with Ian Dury (as a Blockhead) in the late 70s and then in 2011.  He hasn't lost it.<br />Dr Feelgood were probably one of the best UK bands of the 70s.  They were accepted by the Punk crowd despite not being a Punk band.<br />These recordings are of excellent quality and the video extras are varied and super quality too.  Really enjoyed it.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|More amazing plot surprises and great story.  All the characters are being developed and are becoming even more interesting.  Great season.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book was an extraordinarily good read.  The insight it provided into the fundamental, heart-warming reliance of presidents and ex-presidents on each other, regardless of party or polical persuasion, should put to shame anyone who cannot have a civil conversation with someone with different political views.  It was not only a great historical insight into the difficulties of holding that lonely seat at the top, but reminded me of how political differences pale in the face of huge challenges.  I couldn't put it down.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|This is the first QOTSA album I've ever bought/listened to in its entirety.  Aggressive drumming and Bowie-like vocals take you on a tour of hell.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|We are plowing through the series and finding it very historically enjoyable! Even thought it is &#34;dry&#34; in places it livens it up with plenty of sex scenes.The costumes are gorgeous and I feel that the creators worked hard to make the show historically accurate.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|It's nice to have Rod Stewart singing Rod Stewart again. This album has songs that sound as if they could have had a home on any of his past albums. The only 2 songs that make my thumb reach for the skip button are &#34;Time&#34; and &#34;Picture in a frame&#34;.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|A poor disjointed book more suitable for a 8 to 10 year old and I would not recommend it to other than them
B00BJS7104|4.0|Tarrantino doesn't disappoint, this film gabs you right off the bat. Very good performances by many talented actors. This was as exciting as the Kill Bill films...........great action, and thought provoking storyline.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great sequel it keeps you wanting to find out more about Eva and Gideon. This one has fantastic and emotionally raw finish. Can't wait for next book
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I have seen all the Spartacus shows on STARZ and this season was my favorite.  It was the best made IMO and the action/sex/violence were at a whole other level.  RIP Andy Whitfield
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and think this is the best one yet in the MIB series. I do not tire of watching this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is great it is so much fun just like temple run 2 but more creative and better. Great app to get definitely so worth it!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Loved &#34;Night Circus&#34; which makes this one harder to live up to. Still, I am happy that I read it because the author definitely has a flair for drawing you into caring about her characters, and believing in the fantasies!
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is a game that I used to play as a kid.  Not only do you learn new words it has the cutest hangman you ever will see.  This game is funny and entertaining.  My kids love it and laugh when they play.  Get this game it's a winner!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Really worth buying. A fan can not help but have this amazing article. Excellent material of the box. Bring all the movies on Blu Ray
0744014549|5.0|It's HUGE!!<br />Very colorful very high quality paper, the colors just pop. Overall great for the price, needs more pictures of lara very descriptive of all the environments
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I love how the reader is presented the story from both Sam and Grace 's viewpoints.  The characters come from such different backgrounds yet it's like this invisible piece of string connects their past, present, and future and continuously pulls them toward one another.  It's very romantic and touching.  I can't wait to read Linger.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accu weather provides accurate info for when I planning outdoor events.  Quick and easy to use and quite helpful.  Get it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Really worth buying. A fan can not help but have this amazing article. Excellent material of the box. Bring all the movies on Blu Ray
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book starts out a little slow but builds into a roller coaster ride of deceit, scorned love and revenge.  I couldn't put it down!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|its great where ever you go. all of my favorite shapes in one game.just dont like  that the timer never stops until u finish the puzzle.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Had never really seen this show before. It is very entertaining and has a great cast of actors.  Even if you are not a sci fiction fan this series has it all. Highly recommend a watch.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book was amazing! It was a little boring at first, but got better as it went on. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did. The romance and suspense that Jane Austen puts into it is timeless. Next I will be reading Sense and Sensibility. I hope it is as good as this book.  -Hope Venema
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed  with the last book but had to finish the series and read this one. My expectations were quite low and that might be why I am giving it a three instead of a two or one.<br /><br />I felt the characters were thrown into the plot in a random hodge podge, like a poorly put together scrapbook. I didn't invest into the Eric and Sookie break up. Although, I knew she would eventually end up with Sam the feelings were never there and the book left me caring very little about their relationship. Also the 'twist' that Claude shows up I just didn't enjoy. It was a little bit of a one trick pony.<br /><br />Also I was confused and tired of hearing about Sookie's new fantastic magic infused garden. Was that suppose to go somewhere?<br /><br />All in all, I am glad the series is over. Now Alan Ball can now continue to thrill me with True Blood where Charlaine Harris as failed with her last two books.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I finally sat down tonight, and had a chance to see &#34;Argo&#34; for the first time. Excellent movie the one thing that I thought of while watching this movie was that a few very smart people came up with a non violent way to save these 6 (State Department) personal. I can see why it won an &#34;Academy Award&#34; highly recommended to anyone who want's to see a good movie!!!
0064431622|5.0|great experience great book very happy kid she checked the mail every day had wanted this book for a very long time
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game because you can be all of the iron men that Tony ever created in the 3 movies.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|Watch this show several times a week every week.  It is much better than River Dance & River Dance is good.  I like the energy & purity of the show.  It is Irish without the other stuff to dilute it.  It is a real feel good experience that does not get boring!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is super addicting..downloaded it and played it for hours .could not put it down kept me up all night
B00COMLLX2|5.0|This one things I Iiked playing on when I was a kid back then it cost a dime what fun
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Right from the very first chapter I was hooked. The way the author makes the reader actually envision what is going on in the scene was what did it. It is very apparent that not only can he write very well, but he can also tell a story. I know, he wrote a book, of course he can tell a story. That's a somewhat true statement in that many authors can write a story, package it and sell it, but Todd Thiede does all of that while spinning a tale of murder and suspense unlike anything you have ever read. This book is a very good read and it will hold your attention with it's gory murder scenes and the constant twisting and turning of the story. It was a thrill to read it and I don't get to say that very often about books in this genre. This book has quite an original idea behind it and the characters introduced are some of the best around. You will find your self connecting with the two main characters and wanting to see more of them. I would like it if that was in the works and maybe we could get a series out of Max and Jesse. Todd, if you are listening...
B008KP6ENE|4.0|What is the point of the game ?!?!?!?<br />It's actually REALLY FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can anyone tell me? I really want to know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|More cute than funny. Three or four laughs over 1.5 hours is not worth the 3 bucks. Try something else.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|Hacking into WI-FI Passwords is illegal. It says you can do that under the app description. So whatever you do, do not buy this app!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is great. It is like the original only it gives you the advantage of foreign world war  2  style guns. Great for people who like those type of guns or for world war 2  reinactments.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|It's Great App. Works as indented. Can't expect much from this app. Need to check more what are the options can be added.
0439023491|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was one of the best experiences I have had in a while when reading a book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great Game, they add new cars and tracks often and it is great for killing time! I downloaded it and didn't think I would like it that much but I do.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|As always Bosch is a complex smart guy with human foibles that make him believable. He lives and breathes in this book. It's a complicated plot with no obvious or even happy endings. Exciting, intelligent , unpredictable. Loved it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an engaging game, and keeps you going way longer than you would have anticipated. I keep thinking I've won, and then there's a new twist.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I down loaded this to my kindle and it made the hours I spent it the car with my 11 year old grandson just fly by. So entertaining!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It always all the sudden stops.! That's very annoying. But usually it's pretty good. :) but that all the sudden stopping needs to stop itself! :)
B001EN71CW|5.0|I know, its on Netflix. Just not the same.<br />Wish they'd bring it back, even with new casts...but only if Whedon approves and has input.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I've known and loved this band for years, ever since I was a little kid riding around doing errands with my musically hip dad before I was even ready for school. Once I saw this album as an MP3, I couldn't resist. It's a great rock album and one of their finest sets. Thanks,Amazon for making it available.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm a big John Grisham fan.  I believe I have read all of his books with my all time favorite being &#34;A Painted House&#34;.  I have read and re-read it many times....But I truly enjoy them all. There is so much suspense in them...
0812993845|5.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella books and enjoyed this one as much as any of her other books.<br />Two sisters, deep in friendship and understanding of one another. But what happens when one sister marries a guy she knew years ago who returns to her life out of the blue? Especially after the man she has been with for 5 years doesn't pop the question and she breaks up with him? Return to past lover that is what!<br />While they are ready to consummate their marriage, her sister is ready to make sure they don't. It reminded me of \\"its a mad mad mad mad world\\" in the sense of travel, misunderstandings, comedy farces. Truly a fun book to read.
B0060QM09M|5.0|Starts off where the first book left off and continues the same way. Great humor, wonderful stories that take you back to pre-war rural England.
0143122843|5.0|A vivid and frightening look into the mindset and mentality of the Nazi hierarchy. The Bernie Gunther character has morals, flaws, intelligence, tenacity and bravery in the face of the most monstrous regime in recent human history. A fascinating read. Prague Fatale was my first immersion into the works of Philip Kerr and I can't wait to try another.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very cool and very original game that will keep your mind working from beginning to end. My ONLY minor complaint is that it isn't long enough. On the other hand that can be said about every great game, book, movie or anything else that you just don't want to end because it is so good. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who like solving puzzles or that secretly wishes that they were a detective!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Was having trouble finding this battery #397/396 for my watch and was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon. But then, Amazon is where I look for everything I can't find in the open market. Battery working great and have my watch back.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Solid app, especially since it was free. Easy to use and to follow. Easy to read as well. Good app.
B00BESCJII|5.0|This was a really good movie with a story of one young man's struggle to find acceptance both of himself and his hurts of the past.  It portrays the mistakes we all makes (especially as teens) and shows how we grow from them and they become simply a part of who we are, neither good nor bad.  Not overly &#34;dramatic&#34; or &#34;unrealistic,&#34; it was a great watch!
0345529057|5.0|A must read. Really enjoy the HBO  series but like all movies the booksthey are about are much more informative, and enjoyable.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I have always loved this book and movie, so I had to get the 3D version. The conversion was good!
1434441636|5.0|Classic book on practical philosophy. I read this book over twenty years ago and rereading now provided even greater insight.
B006DHASYM|4.0|EXACTLY what you would expect....funny and cute...just makes you feel good about the journey of happenings and happenstance.  And I really think it show how crazy some people can get about it...hahas
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you will love temple run you will love this game .fun you will jump over trains it is so fun!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Average app, works good. Pretty much what you would expect from an app and nothing more. No complaints and nothing over the top either
B000FC0V3E|1.0|In my opinion this an over rated book for this day and age. It may have been a revelation when published, but is now an old story. It is repetetive and moves slowly.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|It's not any prize winning flic but it has merit.  The characters could be developed for more but it is obvious why it has made it.  I would not have turned it down if approached....woman know exactly how to spend their money and this is a great escape for them.
B0049J0DC8|4.0|I have always loved Toy Story since I saw it for the first time when I was a teenager. But now that I have kids of my own, I suppose I analyze things more carefully. Great movie, funny, but also, since I'm not a huge fan of the disrespectful talk between characters. That is really the only thing I wish was different.  I just wish in a G movie it wouldn't be called upon to make the humor more interesting to the older crowd. Otherwise, great movie.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Our two year old granddaughter is currently into elephants, so this was an easy choice. The classic movie is now a favorite to a new generation.
