B007PVHAN2|5.0|As a long time Marley fan I was very pleased with this film.  A few key things like his honoring by the United Nations were left out but we got a well balanced portrait of the man.  Of course it is the music that shines through as the star - they did a great job with that!  One Love and ongoing positvibes to the world from Bob.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|In the past I have loved reading Lee Child books, but I must admit this book I found in the beginning to be very captivating, and the more I read the book it became very long winded, very drawn out not full of action the previous books have been. I was sadly disappointed. I live in hope,the next book returns to the usual action packed adventures we the reader is drawn into and held glued to each chapter.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I really loved this book. Feynman's observations and look at his life. The two most important that stuck with me is his childish curiosity which he cultivated contributed to much of success. This childish curiosity is something I lost, and I am trying to recover.
B004I744AS|5.0|New nuring student so a lot of new words.I use that app  while studying and the definitions are only a fingertip away.
B009CPES4I|4.0|With this cast, we didn't think there was any way for this movie to be bad -- Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson...  The cast, including all not mentioned, didn't disappoint.  But they didn't have to lift poor material.  Altho nothing terribly unexpected finally occurs, the whole thing is just a delight, and utterly charming.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Oringally read this when it was first published many years ago.  Loved it then, and love it now.<br />Still as great as ever!
B004GYY714|4.0|Download was fast and easy to install.  Searches for radio stations is easy and quick with most stations already identified to make for an easy search.  Tuning in via wifi is a snap.  Good product.

B002BWCJOA|4.0|My second grader loved this movie although a couple weeks later she had a bad dream about it and was worried I was going to get \\"button eyes\\".  Cute characters and another great Tim Burton movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|My mouth was open the entire time. i love the way everything came out in the end. i kept wondering what was going on with gideon and why he was being so secretive. i also love how eva started to take matters into her on hands to find out what was going on. cant wait til book three comes.
0316228532|4.0|I'll admit that I only picked up this book from the library because it was written by J. K. Rowling and it was actually available when I arrived at the library. I did not intend to read it so soon after it was published and I had very low expectations for it.<br /><br />That said, I am glad I did pick it up because I rather enjoyed it. This is a dark and unpleasant story full of mostly horrible people doing some not-so-nice things. It is a dramatization of real life, full of drugs, sex, violence and politics. It is not fun or fluffy. For these reasons, I would caution fans of Harry Potter before reading this book as they will find a much different world than they had come to know and love. Remember, this is a book intended for adults.<br /><br />I must also admit that I was surprised at how well Rowling actually writes. I remember thinking she was not a great writer when reading Harry Potter (it was the world that is good), but it is clear that she has a great grip on the English language. The only part that I disliked about the writing was the written dialogue of those living in The Fields. It was very difficult to read and felt a bit old-fashioned, but I am not British and do not understand their obsession with the various accents found on their island, so I am wiling to give her a bit of room here.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad to have read this book and that Rowling wrote it because I would have never thought to pick up the story without her name on it. Not that the book was without flaws, but I do think Rowling has nicely shown that she is a writer of true caliber, not just a fun storyteller of young adult books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is the first that I've read by this author and I was impressed. It keeps your attention, easy read, and overall great book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fantastic book.  The author made me feel I was part of Seal Team Six.  Mr. Owens brings to life what the Seals went through while hunting down the worst person of the 21st century.  The training, planning, preperation; everything captured my interest.  The truth is too good to be fiction.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I could not put this book down. I had to know what was going to happen. Nearly every page had my jaw hanging with disbelief and uncertainty. Great read!
B008RYN44U|3.0|I was really disappointed when I first heard this album because it sounded like a Gwen Stefani solo album. I felt somewhat betrayed because months prior to the release, I would hear interviews from Gwen and the guys that the new album was going to have more ska, reggae, dancehall elements. There's probably only 4 songs on this album with those elements. The rest of the songs are more new wave and dance, but in an 80's/early 90's kind of way.<br /><br />This album is lackluster. The entire album is sorta bland. There's a few stand out tracks, but alot of filler.<br /><br />Stand out songs here are Settle down, Easy, Looking hot, and Push and Shove. The title track is the BEST track on this album. This song represents No Doubt and what they're all about. It shows how talented these guys are. The beats are awesome. All the elements on this song blend so effortlessly. I wish all the songs on this album were as amazing as this.<br /><br />But the rest of the songs feel more like filler songs. They almost feel like they were quickly written and put together. The songs sound a little boring and bland. These songs include Gravity, Undercover, Sparkle, Heaven. When I first heard Heaven  I didn't know what to think. This song sounds like a pop song from the early 90's, with incredibly corny lyrics (\\"Baby you're my heaven\\"). But damn its catchy. It'll get stuck in your head.<br /><br />No Doubt is capable of making better music. They've done it before. Honestly I wouldn't mind having waiting another 11 years to hear new music from the guys if that was enough time for them to really focus on making 11 amazing songs for the album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I first started reading the shades trilogy I thought, from comments I heard, that it was going  to be a raunchy run of the mill story. I was so pleasantly surprised to find myself completely engrossed in a beautiful love story. Shades Freed had me turning pages way into the night. Entertaining, beautiful, engrossing and a completely enjoyable story.

B000ADWDF2|4.0|In Cinema there are techniques that make the film - guide the story; the most useful of these are subtle and unobtrusive, usually the efforts of the Director. It is the case with this film that the story appears clear and whole near the conclusion, to which we have been led without spectacular or unnecessary pathos. In this case emotions triumph character so skillfully we must reflect on the movie to find the several beautiful connections. A point can be made the story might have ended ten minutes earlier with good effect. But, in reflection (which a good film fosters), the message of human triumphs and frailties outlasts any minor desires a viewer may wish for the characters. I give it four stars because it is NOT a tale of brothers, even though they contrast in accomplishment. And because there is no message (though there is no rule there should be) but that mankind is an often fragile being, strong one moment and broken the next.<br />All the acting is superb - and the children are precious.<br />The CD I received has several choices for subtitles - and the key to seeing English subs is to highlight \\"off\\" in the menu.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I knew not to expect an award winning book, but this book was just a little overboard on how it was written. The book was written like it was forced to put adult content into it, the book was very choppy and didn't flow. Again I knew not to expect an award winning book but I was expecting a decent story to enjoy.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|RE1 the movie was the other good re movie, other then that the live action Mila and her husband director are cheesy and are made for the people that don't enjoy the RE game series.  This movie fits into the RE world nicely, it makes sense.  The animated characters are like how they are animated in the game.  Leon looks just like how he is in [[ASIN:B0050SXLQC Resident Evil 6]] adians well as Ada.  This Cg actually looks much better then the last in [[ASIN:B001I9XOQO Resident Evil: Degeneration]] wher th epeople face looked like wax.  It still does to some extent, but much nicer, close to re6 game render and better.<br /><br />Storyline and plots are simple, but good enough to have a little twist, so I won't give too much away.  Animation and scenes is like a bond like eastern Europe terrorist setting.  Leon is one of my favorite character as all the games and movies he has a lead are good.  He had a smaller role in resident evil retribution.  In a span of 2 weeks i watched resident evil retribution and Damnation as well as RE6 the game.  Overload, not some much, it is the best video game series in my book, so I will take time time watch all the movies like Harry Potter fans do to their series.<br /><br />Good action,  good storyline, good character development, good rendering, so this is a good buy for RE fans.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|seemed like it would be a good tome but for some reason it totally messed up the touch screen.  I spent the first five minutes tapping on and around the objects I was pointed to and it would not register until I would get lucky and tap just the right spot.  after closing the program I saw that normal kindle functions were doing the same thing.  had to restart.  uninstalled.

1451627297|5.0|I love to read, I don't get to read as often as I would like to.  However, since I already have an innate fascination with the JFK assassination and King; when my daughter got me this book for my birthday this year I was ecstatic.  I plowed through, it did not disappoint!  It is a great read, and an immediate favorite!  It's very captivating, heftily researched and accurately nostalgic!  Tip of the hat to you Mr. King!

B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I was having yet another truly lousy day in a long string of truly lousy days and was in the worst possible mood imaginable.  I decided to rent this because I loved the old series and thought it might maybe cheer me up a little bit.  I just finished watching it and am still laughing just thinking about it and ordering the dvd right after I post this.  Thank you Amazon for having this gem available to rent.  I didn't even know this movie had been released until I found it here.  Awesome!
B007X15GRQ|5.0|This is a great moive some of the best work I have seen that Mark Walhberg has done a while.  And Kate Beckensale changed my veiw of her I beleived that she did action best, but she showed me that she can do drama too.

B001LM1456|4.0|I liked this movie very much. Exspecially the way it has been tied in with Iron Man1 & 2 Thor and Captain America in perparations for the movie the avengers
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Yeah, all the reviews are correct, this game is a fun and easy. My wife and I play it, just two people and we have fun with it. Lots of laughs.<br /><br />But honestly don't buy it here on Amazon, if you just go to the company's website it's 13 bucks plus shipping.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love the Reacher books. I can't put them down  until I've read all the way through, and read them more than once. But for this one, once is enough. It just was not as intense as the Reacher books usually are... and I began to wonder how many ways he could describe the wide open country. All in all, a disappointing book for me.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Battleship was a Fun movie, certainly kept me awake throughout. Although the story line lacked a little it did have lots of action, a little romance and as my husband said, loud!

B0098VXE50|2.0|I bought the DVD version and could not see the whole movie. The movie runs well for a while then stops and goes back to scenes already seen. So I tried to fast forward on the scenes that jump back but instead I end up skipping other scenes. So, I guess I will end up renting it at a video store.

B005LAJ212|5.0|I enjoyed this show from the very first episode/pilot.  Mysterious, & entertaining and brilliantly set in the Hamptons, the characters are intriguing and leave me anticipating each new episode.  Having the season on tape gave me the chance to see elements I'd missed when they were televised and drew me even more into the story.  What will Emily and her faithful sidekick Nolan do next.... Reminds me of the good old days of Dallas, Knot's Landing, Falconcrest..... Great entertainment to take along when traveling.....yea for the larger screens of the laptop and DVD player.

0618918248|1.0|On the back of my copy of The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, it praises him for his \\"hard hitting...rebuttal of religious belief\\" and his \\"incisive logic\\". Dawkins is characterized as a preeminent scientist. I am not aware of any special contribution to real science he has made.<br /><br />Having had a rich fan who purchased his teaching position for him at, once great Oxford University, he has proceeded to popularize the now scientifically untenable, basically religious doctrine of evolution. His title there is \\"The Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science\\". Some find an enormous irony in the name \\"Simonyi\\", so suggestive of the medieval practice of buying church offices, especially when, as I understand it, Oxford now has the practice of employing only atheist professors. Is it a sort of establishment of Atheist religion?<br /><br />In his book The God Delusion, (henceforth referenced TGD), after his remarks about Islamic religion, Dawkins follows up with a misrepresentation of Christian faith. \\"More generally (and this applies to Christianity no less than to Islam), what is really pernicious is the practice of teaching that faith itself is a virtue. Faith is an evil precisely because it requires no justification and brooks no argument.\\" (TGD, p.347). First of all, we have the logical fallacy of Equivocation, \\"this is just like that\\" when it isn't. Neither Christians nor Muslims would agree that their religions were virtually identical and neither would any person who had honestly studied them. But here we see the power of the one liner, the Atheist's favorite attack, One line which it might take a whole book to refute. Next we have the Atheist dogma that there is only one definition of \\"faith\\" When there are many, allegiance, trust, fidelity to one's promises, belief in the doctrines of a religion, to mention a few. The latter may be supported by various kinds of evidence. Certainly in Christianity we have many works of \\"Apologetics\\". This discipline is based on the Greek word, not meaning making excuses, but setting forth the reasons for things, One thinks of Plato's Apology, part of a trilogy of Dialogs concerning the trial and death of Socrates. Also McDowell's book Evidence That Demands a verdict. Get it Dawkins? Evidence!<br /><br />All knowledge is based on faith. For example, I believe (have faith, trust, have confidence) that the temperature on my back porch is 90 degrees. Why? Because I believe that the expansion and contraction of mercury correlates with the rise and fall of the temperature of the air. I further believe that the universe is governed by natural physical laws which have always been in operation everywhere and always will be. Dawkins and the atheist, evolutionist True Believers cannot deal with the fact that their religion is based on faith in many ways like Christian faith. One the first principles of logical thinking is to use clear, well defined works. I think of American humorist Goodman Ace who satirized Dawkins sort of approach as: \\"Learn a word a day, use it any old way!\\"<br /><br />The most basic branch of Philosophy is Epistemology or Theory of Knowledge. Is there any absolute truth? (TGD, pp. 323-326). The Atheist evolutionist answer is a combination of Denial, Refusal to Discuss and Scientism. Running all through Dawkins book is the assertion and insinuation that God's revealed Word is not true because it is based on \\"faith\\" which he irrationally and unhistorically defines.(TGD p. 347). Science is based on \\"knowledge\\", he has not defined, and scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which is worthwhile. Here we have simply evaded the obvious weakness of scientific knowledge. First of all not all scientists have the same philosophy of science. The truth claims of different philosophies are different, Pragmatism and Operationalism claim scientific ideas are useful but not true Scientific Realism's claim to truth is highly problematical and Thomas Kuhn(The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) tells us that Scientists work with praradigms which may or may not be true. Dawkins can tell us nothing about Philosophy of Science because he knows nothing about the subject and denies that philosophers have anything worthwhile to say such as St.Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. Dawkins condemns Christians precisely because they believe in absolute truth. But if there is no absolute truth, there isn't any other kind. Relativism fails when it says that things approximate the truth or are relatively more true than others.How can you approximate something that doesn't exist?<br /><br />In Free Inquiry Magazine (Vol. 18 No. 2) Dawkins says \\"What has theology ever said that is of the smallest use to anybody? When has theology ever said anything that is demonstrably true and is not obvious? The great medieval Philosopher, Thomas Aquinas is condemned for arguments that don't prove anything, and are easily... exposed as vacuous.\\". (p. 100). As always, Dawkins unsupported opinion is the final arbiter of truth, especially after Dawkins has misstated Aquinas argument.<br /><br />The concept of Scientism is defined in Glossory Online as follows: \\"Unlike the use of the scientific method as only one mode of reaching knowledge, scientism claims that science alone can render truth about the world and reality. Scientism's single-minded adherence to only the empirical, or testable, makes it a strictly scientific worldview....Scientism sees it necessary to do away with most, if not all, metaphysical, philosophical, and religious claims, as the truths they proclaim cannot be apprehended by the scientific method. In essence, Scientism sees science as the absolute and only justifiable access to the truth.\\"<br /><br />Cracker barrel philosopher, Auguste Comte, propounded \\"The law of three stages\\" which states that, in its development, humanity passes through three successive stages: the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive. (see Dagobert D. Runes,Dictionary of Philosophy, pp. 60-61). Not much is known about him these days but his lasting influence in science is seen the anti-metaphysical superstition of contemporary science. A substitute teacher who signed up in the Indianapolis Public School System was told by eight different science teachers that he had missed his calling by not being a science teacher, They added \\"Too bad you wasted so much time taking Philosophy courses.\\". Radical Atheists typically make statements like \\"Metaphysics is rubbish!\\" This parallels their other favorite diatribe \\"There is no absolute truth!\\" Both share the same logical fallacy, the first is a metaphysical statement and the second a statement of absolute truth, so if either is true it is also false.<br /><br />Metaphysics is simply your answer to \\"What is the nature of God, Man and the Universe?\\". For this you do not have to be a philosopher. If you are a living, breathing human being, you have to have some notion of these things. Often these are among your more or less unconscious opinions but they are there. Dawkins answer is there is no God because he says so. Man, people are apes, brother to the Gorilla and the Chimpanzee.(see the definition of Primate in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary) of The Universe is a collection of blind, meaningless haphazard events which by the process of evolution cause the existence of highly complex, well ordered plants, animals and human apes. Scientific thinking is founded on many metaphysical ideas such as universal physical laws,<br /><br />Dawkins monism is justified by him by saying \\"...mind is a manifestation of matter - material in a brain or perhaps a computer - and cannot exist apart from matter.\\" (TGD, p. 209). This is simply begging the question. We all believe in non-material realities. If 2+2=4 and it's somehow just generated in our brain, what significance can it have. Again he undermines the possibility of objective truth. Perhaps this generated notion could be cured byTums for the Tummy. The feeling of an upset stomach is transmitted to us our coscious minds by the physical process of our brain. Mind in this context becomes a sort of epi-phenomenom.<br /><br />Logic, particular principles and theories. Which of these are material, what do they weigh?, how long are they, wide, thick? So how is Dawson's Monism a valid perspective? That is the notion that Matter, material things are the only significant reality reality? Dawkins religion has no plausible reliable foundation of truth or metaphysical reality. But from this Shifting sand perspective he proceeds to tell us Americans who's who, what's what, how we should run our country and where every one of us should get off! A remarkable performance! That is what chapter 9 is all about, how our parents, who give their children religious instruction, should have their children taken away from them.<br /><br />One big problem which renders Dawkins position wholly untenable to a logical mind, is the Ontological significance of Logic. Ontology is the branch of philosophy which deals with the nature of reality or being. According to Dawkins, and most evolutionists, the natural world, the only reality which counts for anything, Nature is a big, churning mass of random, irrational, meaningless, accidental causality which chucked out, among other things, the intuitions which provide the basis for Logic. Intuitions being the perception of evenness, identity, primitive number sense, etc. The problem with this, which evolutionists have no answer for, is that this guarantees that there can be no necessary connection between Logic and reality. Thus, even if you have a flawless argument it is still false because it is not connected to the real world. In the Christian system of metaphysics, because God created us in His own image and Logic is a n attribute of God, There is a necessary connection. We have every reason to believe that the real is rational and the rational real. It doesn't of course matter what Dawkins believes because, according to him, beliefs don't matter. For Dawkins views on philosophy of science see TGD, pp. 209-212.<br /><br />Underlying Dawkins Scientism is the indefensible notion that Science is one big, unified, homogeneous \\"thing\\". There are many scientists and many different philosophies .of science, Pragmatism, Operationalism, etc. Scientific Realism seems to be closest to what Dawkins has faith in. We must remember Dawkins has no mastery of Logic and boasts of knowing nothing of any aspect of Philosophy or Theology despite the fact these are closely related to real science. The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy in its article on Philosophy of Science has this to say about Scientific Realism \\"...those who describe themselves as scientific realists\\" claim \\"that 'mature' scientific theories typically refer to real features of the world, that the history of past falsifications of accepted scientific theories does not provide good reason for persistent skepticism as to the truth claims of contemporary theories...\\". Or in other words just because we were wrong a hundred times in the past is no reason to think we're not right now. To parady \\"On science, the solid rock I stand! All other ground is sinking sand! Burble, burble, burble !\\" Sorry folks, he went down for the third time! But come back tomorrow.\\" Of course we can't ridicule Dawkins for this inadequate belief, he doesn't have one. His \\"science is sort of like a table with all four legs cut off of it, he expects it to remain 30 inches off the ground.<br /><br />Beyond this, we have to look at the fact that \\"Ideas have consequences.\\" One of Dawkins glaring contradictions is that his lied about consequences of Christian belief are real and the true evil consequences of Dawkins Socialist tyrannies is something to be denied and covered up. Crushing the skull of an innocent baby, sucking the brains out and chopping him into six pieces is not murder, that is, taking innocent human life,but real murderers should not be executed for their crimes.<br />A case in point is the evolutionist myth which has produced nothing but racism and fascism. Non-specialists eagerly transported the idea of biological evolution to other realms entirely: T. H. Huxley and his ilk popularized \\"Social Darwinism\\" in interracial and international affairs, which led to racist The Atheist eugenics, adopted in Naziism. Read from Darwin to Hitler, the book the evolutionists are frantically trying to repress.<br /><br />We are going to look a few classic Logical Fallacies and Contradictions. Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc, this is the fallacy that because A took place before B, it is the cause of B. This fallacy is the foundation of the notion that the fossil record demonstrates evolution. The even bigger lie here is that plants and animals alive today have been found along side of creatures claimed to have died out billions of years ago (See Ken Ham, The Lie!:Evolution).<br /><br />Insufficient Evidence-Virtually all so called \\"primitive men\\" have been reconstructed from a few bones, sometimes only a tooth or three fragments. from this they decide what the entire skeleton was like, five foot six or six foot two,what it looked like on the outside, how much hair it had and what he had for breakfast. The Pictorial Encyclopedia of The Evolution of Man by J. Jelinek shows most of the wishful thinking \\"primitive men\\" for which there is insufficient evidence. A marvelous work of science fantasy.<br /><br />Appeal to Authority-There are valid authorities and dubious or invalid ones. One of most fallacious is: \\"All scientists believe in evolution.\\" First of all we have an undefined term. Does \\"Scientists\\" include Engineers, medical researchers, people with undergraduate degrees in science, what? Scientists, however defined, are narrow specialists, evolution has no relevance to their work, many have just blindly accepted it because it was labelled science, many are afraid they would lose their jobs or teaching positions if they criticized it and many have never studied it. This statement is no more significant than \\"All scientists like pink tea.\\"<br /><br />Another example of his Contradictions:'\\"Human embryos are examples of human life. Therefore, by absolutest religious lights, abortion is simply wrong; full fledged murder....many of those who most ardently oppose the taking of embryonic life also seem to be more than usually enthusiastic about taking adult life.\\" (TGD, p. 329). The civilized and Biblical definition of murder is \\"Taking innocent human life.\\" Dawkins with his Goodman Ace definitions doesn't share this idea. Murder is justifiable when the victim feels no pain. Of course we aren't just talking about embryos here, we are talking about well formed babies. If they are not innocent human life what is? The particularly brutal criminals are not \\"innocent human life\\" . They have broken the law and deserve to be punished. This is called Justice and it Is not in Dawkins vocabulary. The insinuation that there is a contradiction in the Christian position doesn't hold up. We support the death penalty for convicted murderers and oppose it for innocent babies. Dawkins boasts that his position involves respect for human life. How does he show respect human life by crushing the skulls of tens of millions of innocent babies, sucking their brains out and cutting them in pieces? What is Humane about this? If a person did this to an older person, it would be considered an especially horrifying and goulish crime. Yet Dawkins has found complete fulfillment by this Atheist ordained lifestyle.<br /><br />In conclusion, we can see that Dawkins' claims are extremely ignorant and unfounded, even an embarrassment to well educated people. They involve this fascinating contradiction: Dawkins boasts that Theology and Philosophy are nothing subjects which he refuses to study and then proceeds to dogmatically assert the last final word on something he boasts he knows nothing about. The Existentialist philosopher, Jose Ortega y Gasset, in his book The Revolt of the Masses, comments that \\"I have studied philosophy all my life, but when I encounter a layman, he feels we are on a completely equal level, even though he has never given five minutes of serious thought to what we are talking about,\\" Yes, Ortega, you are right, people like Dawkins, are indeed revolting, in several senses of the word.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|I am a true fan of Bill Bryson, and love his voice. One thing I particularly love about this book was that he makes us laugh and love our country despite the many imperfections! We're glad he came back to the good old USA.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so much fun. I always loved it at the fair or carnival, and now I have it on my kindle. it is so much fun, and it had a great price lol.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game for people with add. It has a huge variety of mint games and you're actually playing to unlock the next game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game. the games can get very challenging. I like the up grade. I'm only giving it 4 stars because its not 5 star material
B00932A2MC|5.0|I loved how they did this! I was a little nervous about a movie based on a board game but they did a great job. Loved it!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Lee child's books are great but my son an myself thought this one lacked a little pace early on an picked up at the end of book
034580404X|4.0|I couldn't put the first two books down. The third went a little slower in the beginning but, by the halfway point I was hooked again. You can expect to laugh, cry, and be extremely aroused, all in a matter of a a few pages. Still, I am amazed that this is the writers first attempt and, highly recommend reading these books. The only reason I didn't go 5 stars is because of the little tell tale signs of the writers lack of experience, I found that to be minimal but, still obvious and, the sex scenes were so common that they became boring, by the third book I was skimming through them to get back to the story line. In talking with others who have read all three, they all did the same thing, some, by the middle of the second book. I would for sure have gone with 4 1/2 stars if given the option.
1451662432|5.0|First of all, folks who bash that book are either full of complexes or are pathologic loosers. Why deny soeone the right to reveal his true human story? And why pass judgment on the person? This is a book review after all. Personally I find this autobiography entertaining and inspirational. Arnold's story is all what the American dream is. It should serve as a guideline how to stay focused on your goals if you want to reach them. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most interesting personalities of our time. Not a saint for sure, but do you know anyone who is flawless?

B007GCY8FS|5.0|GREAT BOOK,SHOWS JACK IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. PROBABLY ONE OF HIS BEST BOOKS.<br />STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND A SHORT TOM CRUISE PLAYING JACK, WHAT A BUST
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|this set goes great with the matching kitchen. it has slots and spaces for everything.  my son really enjoys playing with it (he is one).  the salt and pepper shakers make noise when you shake them so they are definitely a favorite. the only problem is they are made from a very soft wood. my son likes to give things to our dog if she has it for one second it has teeth marks or chunks out of it.  we will sand it down, but it will need to be replaced as she had completely ruined three pieces already.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|\\"Safe House\\" comes on like a souped-up \\"Bourne\\" directed by Tony Scott - all frantic pace, sinister synths and choppy-choppy editing. Sure this has been done before - but what's makes this espionage movie so different is the sheer effort the cast, crew and writers put into depicting the 'thrill' in 'thriller'. You can literally feel them working their well-paid butts off to please you in every possible way. Add to this formidable stew of film-making excellence - a cleverly chosen cast of top class actors like Denzel Washington, Sam Sheppard, Robert Patrick, Vera Farmiga, Fares Fares, Ruben Blades and the superb Irish duo of Brendan Gleeson and Liam Cunningham - and you can almost forgive Ryan Reynolds trying to break free from rom-coms and getting all John McClane sweaty teeshirt on us...<br /><br />As you can imagine the action comes at you fast and furious. The fight sequences were choreographed for months in advance (using the actors themselves) and escalate in their ingenuity and hands-on nature - while the car chases are pulse-pounding too. But its the great cast who give it a beating heart. With the exception of say Liam Neeson or Tommy Lee Jones - I couldn't see any other leading man bring so much to a cop/agent as Denzel Washington does. He is typically brilliant here. He plays Tobin Frost - the CIA's more-wanted whistleblower (off the grid for a decade) who suddenly waltzes into the American Embassy in South Africa's capital city of Cape Town. Years of interrogation techniques under his belt and a file in his leg that will fry many dodgy types on different continents - Tobin smiles, grimaces and generally messes with everyone's head. Digging in to find more nuances - Denzel is magnificent at this - and it goes a long way to keeping you watching as the begrudging relationship develops between his character (the old timer on the run) and Reynolds character Matt Weston (the rookie forcing into protecting him from all comers). And on it goes to a final show-and-tell gun battle in another compromised 'safe house' where the young buck Matt has been seriously underestimated by everyone - including the good guy/bad guy Tobin Frost (dialogue above)...<br /><br />The BLU RAY picture isn't great it has to be said because Director Daniel Espinosa is going for gritty realism and not clean cut - but it does show off the superb and extensive use of Cape Town as a city and the South African countryside that surrounds it which has a certain beautiful light - and look. Placing it in this unusual location gives the street action (and shanty town sequences) a fresh feel too. And don't watch the extras 'before' the movie - they give away far too much plot.<br /><br />A bit of a cracker frankly...<br /><br />PS: Look out too for the unpronounceable NORA ARNEZEDER who plays the 23-year old French girlfriend Ana - I'm certain she's been genetically engineered by the CIA to be one of the most gorgeous women on Earth - and will therefore turn out to be the 'sleeper agent' in \\"Safe House 2 - The Sequel - Even Safer Than The Last House\\".<br /><br />You heard it here first folks...-tell gun battle in another compromised 'safe house' where the young buck Matt has been seriously underestimated by everyone - including the good guy/bad guy Tobin Frost (dialogue above)...<br /><br />The BLU RAY picture isn't great it has to be said because Director Daniel Espinosa is going for gritty realism and not clean cut - but it does show off the superb and extensive use of Cape Town as a city and the South African countryside that surrounds it which has a certain beautiful light - and look.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the variety of translations available. a smart Bible student doesn't just stick to one translation. I like to read a verse from my go to translation and then compare it in the other translations to find the closest meaning to me. recomend this app to everyone.
B000HF0ILY|4.0|It is a loose remake of Shane but still very well done.  The blu-ray quality is not as good as I had hoped (still too dark and grainy).
B0068LYEHA|4.0|This was my first book of Ms. Moran's and I was very impressed. I enjoyed how she addressed the negative connotations surrounding feminism and met them head-on. All though I do not agree with all of her points, I do see her point of view. I look forward to reading her other novels and articles.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Very seldom do you see a movie that had the right actor for the part that they played.<br /> Charlize Theron took control of the movie and never let go until her death.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This film took me on the ride of my life!! Frame after frame seemed to turn the wrong corner and yet somehow brought me to such enlightment as I have rarely experienced in the realm of Art.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack is number 1! I like this even better than the Stripes. He seems even more free in this format.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this case a couple months ago, and I have liked it ever since. It seems very durable. I would recommend this case to anyone.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love this app but it is occasionally nonresponsive.  so far it has not been a big problem.  hopefully this app continues to perform.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I only tried this game because of the reviews and the ratings were spot on! A very fun game with hours of entertainment. I'll be playing trying more of these type of games for sure!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I watched an interview with J.K. Rowling and became very interested in why she called it a book written for adults and if you didn't cry at the end, she had nothing to say to you...  That was enough mystery to get me to download the free sample on my Kindle.  I was reading at a very good clip and knew I had to find out how this was going to end so  I bought it.  I was hooked and could not put it down in the beginning but somewhere in the middle it became mostly centered around teenage preoccupation along with an extreme overuse of crude language that was no longer necessary to build the characters.  Too many character dysfunctions made it more distracting than intriguing.  And so-called 'big secrets' I found laughable - not shocking.  It's almost as though the Author couldn't decide which of her good ideas she wanted to focus on so she threw everything in there and unfortunately, in my opinion, it became cluttered and lost its momentum.  It's a shame.  One of the questions in the interview was whether or not it would become a movie to which she said, no and now that statement makes sense. Bottom-Line:  I feel mislead.  I feel this was  written for teens in mind - not adults.  And I paid top dollar for a book that sadly, wouldn't be surprised to see in the discount book area by Christmas.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is great.  Seamlessly allows me to jot down any ideas or inspiration, from any device allowing retrieval from anywhere. No more little scraps of paper or little notepads to lose.
B000ID37LS|4.0|The Frighteners is a great movie. Released in 1996, and directed by Peter Jackson, this movie has it all.  Its funny, creepy, and has a clever and original story.  Michael J. Fox, and Jeffrey Coombs of Re-Animator fame, both deliver knock out performances, as does the rest of the cast. The only downside to this movie is the effects are looking dated at this point.  I can't really think of a movie to compare the Frighteners to, but if you like to laugh, and enjoy a good story, I highly recommend this one!
B0085LGL5E|5.0|I bought this one just because I got all the other albums and The Hives never disappoint. Most of the songs are fast paced and loud, with witty lyrics. I think this album is way better than Black and White. With The Hives, you know you're gonna get, and this album is a must-have. Favorite songs: Go Right Ahead, 1000 Answers, My Time is Coming, Midnight Shifter.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Will that one be with or without lines? What Color? How many pages?  Choices to make on your own KINDLE Fire owners! Impressive to say the least! I get to make my own choice and these days that can be a rare commodity to obtain!  Fun, free and easy to access!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love the research that Ken Follett does in his historical novels. Really enjoyed Fall of Giants and this book is even better.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Just replacing my stolen cds. Must be well worth it if someone felt that they had to steal them. I was thrilled that they arrived so quickly.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|First, let me say that I'm a Lee Child fan and a Jack Reacher junkie.  I've read each and every book.  In fact, I recently started back at the Killing Floor and reread every one of the books in order start to finish.  That said, let me say that I'm so very disappointed in this lated effort, A Wanted Man.  There's no plot, very little character development and a trite and disappointing conclusion.  Where's the love interest(s), the fascinating characters, the plot twists that hold my interest?  It's as though Reacher has become judge, jury and executioner.  The gratuitous killing and violence was over the top and I didn't feel it added anything to the story.  It's as though Child thinks Reacher fans expect bodies and violence so he throws it in every 10 pages.  And the ending?  Child seems to have phoned it in... and Reacher walks into the sunset through the flames and chaos he has created.<br /><br />Come on Lee... you can do so much better.  You have, over and over again.  Of course this is only my opinion, and I could be wrong.  But this is how i see it.  Will it keep me from buying the next Reacher story on its publication date?  Nope - I'll be there with high hopes that the next one will live up to past works.
B0052VI2V6|5.0|Format: SACD<br /><br />Having been brought up on the later mixes of the songs in various other formats, to go back to the original album in the SACD was a breath of fresh air. Clean, clear and beautifully mixed. This is the Eagles at their best. Highly recommended.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|When I ordered this book I had just finished the Prime Ministers by Yehuda  Avner which I thought was excellent.  I had no idea what Winter of the world<br />was about.  The first chapter beginning in 1933 was unsettling for me but I<br />pursued reading.  It didn't take long before I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE personal<br />life of the characters.  I was nineteen and at University were my interests<br />were more involved with essays and exams.  Now I admit that the war in Europe<br />took second place.  The book informed me  of so many aspects of fascism,<br />commuism.social democracy,humanitarianism and friendship.  The era following the war and the conditions in Germany were totally unsuspected by the process as<br />the refugee problems took priority.  Winter of the world is a book which should<br />be read by all. Let there be no more wars.
B00008WT49|5.0|Format: SACD<br /><br />Having not heard music from Norah Jones I was pleasantly surprised. Many others here have commented more on her style and grace so much better than what I can.<br /><br />The SACD multichannel format of the album is magic. Great sound stage without over-using the rear channel. Her voice is clear and with all the nuances that she brings to her music. The supporting instruments are well placed and her vocals come through clean with the right balance between her voice and the instruments.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|It's a great book with all elements of joy and sadness, anger and humility, not to mention action! It's a long book so don't assume it's a quick read but totally worth every minute. You won't be bored.
B0001K9IJ8|2.0|Format: SACD<br /><br />I have played the album a couple of times now and it leaves me underwhelmed. I feel that this album is not showing what Diana Krall should be capable of. The music seemed 'complicated' and/or 'technical' in places as though she was experimenting with a new style that she does not quite feel comfortable with. She seems to miss a couple of the notes and the album in general feels soulless. Even the quality of SACD was unable to bring the music to life. A real shame as I think she is capable of so much more.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|My boss told me about this book, so I bought it.  I read this book in one day.  I couldn't put it down.  This isn't the genre I typically read, so I found it very interesting learning about the training and demands of a Navy Seal.  The job our nation's elite military teams does is very impressive.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, I truly wonder why it did poorly in the box office.<br />Check it out. Chances are your opinion will greatly differ from that of the critics.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I would rate this novel in the top ten books I have ever read.  I really loved the character development, the interesting connections, and the nesting of six stories in one.  I hope the movie does it justice!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read for women - in fact it wouldn't hurt for a man to read because it would be a lesson on romance!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I used to use freedi but It stopped letting me watch and download videos! Plus the videos are in high quality too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app!!! great ideas and fun to browse! :) lots and lots of ideas for just about everything!!!!!  try it you will love it too!!!
0062082353|5.0|Amazing book....got it day 1 and could not put it down...finished it day 3...recommend it to anyone...all my friends and family are now raving about it and passing it around
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Excellent piece of work from Hitchen's declining days. Unfortunately, the writing becomes uneven near the end, which betrays his worsening condition. The book closes with a heart-wrenching essay by Carol Blue, Hitchens wife. Marvelous read, particularly for those interesting in his thinking about God and religion when facing the inevitability of personal death.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|My wife read this book so this is her review of it. She eagerly awaited Follet's second book in this trilogy series, since she had read the first book, \\"The Fall of Giants\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it.  She likes reading historical novels, and the second book covered major world events from the 1930s through the 1950s. She thought the world events are well described, showing that Follet had done a thorough job of historical research. In the first book she was introduced to families in Russia, Germany, England, and the United States. She liked how Follet continued the story of some of the main characters from the first book, and introduced children of some of the main characters in the second. The interactions of the  novel's characters in these world events were exciting and written in an engaging style with plenty of tension included.  The resistance  of some of Follet's German characters to Hitler's take over she found particularly interesting. Many of them risked their lives in attempts to avoid Hitler's rise to power.<br /><br />A minor criticism that she expressed is because of the number of characters and Follet's adrubt switching back and forth between them, it sometimes  makes it  difficult to follow. Even though all the main characters are fictional, she feels  Follet's portrayal of them is very realistic. She would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical novels that they read this book.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book two was much the same as book one, so I spent a lot of time skimming over the sexual content, which BTW is 3/4 of the book, to get to the story line. E.L. James would be doing herself a favor by including more storyline and less sex in her next book. Too much of anything becomes a bore.
B000V6MQV4|3.0|I'm not a huge Maroon 5 Fan, but I thought this was a pretty good album overall.  Decent vocals, some nice jazzy tunes.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Again, book three is a repetition of books one and two. I was really disappointed in this one because I thought it would end either in tragedy for Christian and Ana, or happily ever after. Instead, the author brought you back to the beginning of Book one and then dropped you. The worst ending I've ever read in a book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my all time favorite version of Jane Eyre!! Both Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson did a fantastic job! First of all they both had feeling. They showed passion, sadness, and best of all, love.<br /><br />Ruth Wilson, love her, was feisty! She said whatever she was thinking, and wasn't shy. She actually showed that she cared for the people she was around. Ruth Wilson was just perfect! Also, she is very pretty. I just love how she portrayed this character.<br /><br />Now, on to Toby Stephens. Oh my goodness, Toby Stephens!! He was perfect. He was brooding, handsome, and showed all the emotions I listed above. The way he fell in with Jane was perfect. It was slow and sweet. You could see the love in his eyes whenever he looked at her, even before he admitted it to himself. And I would that's hard to do. So again, he was perfect.<br /><br />To conclude, this version may not stay true to the script from the book, but they make up for it in their acting. So, if you love Jane Eyre and want to watch a good version, buy this one!! You won't regret it!
B001ZG4J00|5.0|This is the first Amazon review I have ever written. Anywho, so \\"Coming From Reality.\\" My goodness. What an album. Highly recommended.

B00338QENI|5.0|Why did I never hear of this woman in all my schooling! People of all colors and races were the brunt of many horrors at the hands of other people. This is just amazing yet almost unbelievable. The story is well written and it was one of those books I could not put down. I couldn't wait to get back to the next chapter. Henrietta is the woman of the century. I will always be thankful for her sacrifices.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I actually expected it more songs that are in the book and nothing else,i want it to have it exactly as the book.  other than that the music is nice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was great and kept me reading so I didn't want to put the book down. Definitely ready for the next two!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is a great movie and Jennifer Lawrence was spectacular.  It follows the overall telling of the book really well.  Looking forward to the next couple movies.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|Neil Young, has been punching out music for a very long time but there has been nothing to surpass this great album. We all know Southern Man and After the Goldrush but listen to lesser known masterpieces like Birds and I Believe in You and you will instantly want more. Thank you Neil for your great contribution to Rock and Roll History even though it's a pity that 1970 was your greatest year!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The book could have used a little more action in the middle. Book was good but it is hard to believe that Reacher knows more than the FBI & CIA
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I so love Jack!  I have to give the book, A Wanted Man a fun read, but not in the \\"could not put it down catagory as there is not as much action, and gets a little slow with all the driving around in cars.  I thought the book was good, just got tired of riding around so much. I can't wait until the next book. I sure hope there is a next book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play whether alone or with others. cards move easily scoring<br />is accurate. pop ups not so annoying and for price you cant beat it
B008FSCNTK|1.0|In her tribute to Nat King Cole, Diana Krall proved herself a major talent, particularly in phrasing, both pianistically and vocally. All that potential began to unravel about ten years ago as she started courting money, then Elvis Costello. This last release sounds like the end of the spool.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game to waste time while the misses is shopping or to past time when I'm at other boring places.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun little game.  Coins regen quickly when game is running.  I recommend this little time waster.  and it is easy to get free coins.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Second stop after turning the Kindle on. Love it because it is very flee to playing the coin games in the arcade.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This is the second time I have purchased this CD by Corinne Bailey Rae. The entire CD is filled with beautiful songs. Many times you purchase a music CD, only to find a couple songs you like.  This CD has an entire collection of songs you want to listen to. I loved my first purchase and it's even better the second time.
B00684J49U|5.0|great series can`t wait for the 9th series to come out after watching this one.you become involved with the people and the running of the hospital,
1400164257|4.0|I started reading this book on my Kindle a while ago, but it was weird, because it felt just like the TV show \\"Castle\\" which makes sense I suppose, but I was just expecting a little bit different tone I suppose. It took me a while to get into it and then I found the audio version and decided maybe listening to it would be a bit better, and it was. Johnny Heller narrates and he a great job at it. I did still have a hard time getting into it and it was about the time that bad stuff happens to Nikki Heat that I finally was able to break the idea of the show out of my head. The characters really are just like the characters in the show, different names of course, but the same personalities. The crime was pretty interesting, you think you know who did it, but they keep introducing more and more suspects so the actual culprit was somewhat of a surprise. Anyway, the story was entertaining, it would probably be better if I didn't love the show and know the formulas that they use. I love the banter between Heat and Rook and I like how things went between them. I will pick up the rest of the Nikki Heat series and I'm going to have to try out the Derrick Storm series as well. Enjoy and try not to get wrapped up in the similarities of show and book.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another captivating adventure with Jack Reacher - wondering how he will get out of his latest predicament. Every bit as good as the ones that came before.<br /><br />To fill in a little of the time until Jack returns - give \\"Zero Day\\" by David Baldacci a try.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|this book gives a very plausible explanation for the differences in the economic standing of various countries.  Well written and documented

1451696191|5.0|Our high school book club read this as our first selection of the year. We all loved this quick read because it's well written and that holds your attention. The kids engaged in thoughtful discussion about the problems many young people face.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|poor plot pretty good special effects. Theron was pretty good stewart was pretty bad. Would probably skip this one and wait for it to come out on HBO or something
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book of The Hunger Games trilogy is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Once you start it you won‘t want to put it down. I loved the ending. Must read!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This writer cannot possibly be misread by anyone. The knowledge of the content combines with the characters, real/fictional, to present a highly believable scenario; continuing the realities of the characters toward their ends with great talent for presenting the believable. Looking forward with great interest to the final volume in this sweeping trilogy.

B001LNOOG6|5.0|It is rarely that I any longer come across a book that I just can not put down. I don't even need to go into the details of the book or risk giving away the ending. I only need to tell you that I thought this was a book for a man to read and was resistant to picking it up but a friend(man) of mine insisted that I read it. I now insist that you read it. You will thank me.
1423124111|1.0|I just visited Disneyland yesterday and this book is available.  Very disappointed because I ordered over 2 weeks ago and still no status when Amazon will ship.  Make sure you read on availability before ordering.  This is to be used as a gift and lucky it wasn't a tight time date needed by.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good game for a lil bit. cant play for too long or you get bored. some of the games are real difficult on a touch screen
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Yes, the book is heartbreaking but Jaycee is an incredible woman. And what a smart little girl, the journals she kept as a child were well beyond her years. It's a miracle she survived. We should all aspire to be as positive as she is.
B0092MDGBM|5.0|This season is equal to the last but since the first season was awesome, that means so is season two. I thoroughly enjoy this show and it reminds me a lot of The Sopranos. If you liked the Sopranos then you'll love Boardwalk Empire.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|There are several reviews that give this recording one star and essentially they all say that the original versions were better.<br /><br />This is the wrong way to experience music (or for that matter anything). The way to listen to this is if you had never heard a Bob Dylan song and someone threw this on the CD player.<br /><br />If you do that I am pretty sure you will be blown away by the album
B002VWNIAY|3.0|[[ASIN:B001EBWING Casablanca]]I've heard of the movie, Casablanca, all of my life. I'm not a movie fanatic. Casablanca is a good 'looking' film. It's shot perfectly. The writing is good as is the acting. There's nothing to complain about and if you like older movies, I'm sure Casablanca would be a nice addition to your collection.<br /><br />Now that we have instant entertainment in so many forms (some not as healthy as others), and so many things screaming for our time, it's hard to give the better part of two hours for a movie.<br /><br />Like so much of Hollywood's offerings, Casablanca glamorizes adultery. I suppose I was looking more for the legend than the actuality of the movie. If I'd never seen it, my life would not have been any poorer.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I have been waiting for this follow-up and I was not disappointed.  I loved it even more than Bared To You.  It is highly emotionally charged but that is their dynamic.  I cannot wait until the third book!
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian Hunter is like a fine wine.<br />He just keeps getting better with age<br />There is not one bad song on this album.<br />His last 2 albums  before this one were good, but this one is his best  work to date.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a must read kind of book. I was very impressed by the writers ability to write his first hand account of what happened. I just hope he has it in him to write another. With honors I say thank you sir for your service to this country.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is not a long book, but I love the way it makes you feel like someone is telling you a story.  All the way through you are thinking am I wasting away my days on something unimportant, when I should be enjoying the moments as they come?
1439102732|5.0|This book tackles issues always in the news. Contraversal issues people don't want to talk about.  I think Jodi<br />Picoult handled it really well.  She's gives both sides of arguements.It's up to you what you want to believe.  Really well written.  I enjoy all her books.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|I purchased this movie thru amazon video due to the fact that I didn't have the opportunity to watch it on the big screen. It was an early release and digital only.<br /><br />The movie itself is really good. All the CGI is pretty awesome and the story really gets you involved.<br /><br />I regret buying this movie thru amazon digitally. First half hour or so it was perfect then it started lagging and giving connection issues. I went to my PC and did a speed test and got 30mbps did it thru the PlayStation and got 25 too. So it was not on my side yet I had to keep restarting my connection so that amazon refreshed my IP.<br /><br />Amazon needs to get more professional talent to work on this software as it is laggy and poorly arranged. As a result I will never buy another early digital release and will buy only bluray discs. Until now u can't beat that contrast.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I have read all the books in the Mickey Haller Series (this is #4) and really enjoyed it as so relates to the mortgage fraud business.  Mickey Haller (love this character)....has fallen on tough times. He expands his business into foreclosure defense, only to see one of his clients accused of killing the banker she blames for trying to take away her home.<br /><br />Mickey puts his team into high gear to exonerate Lisa Trammel, even though the evidence and his own suspicions tell him his client is guilty. Soon after he learns that the victim had black market dealings of his own, Haller is assaulted, too--and he's certain he's on the right trail.<br /><br />Despite the danger and uncertainty, Haller mounts the best defense of his career in a trial where the last surprise comes after the verdict is in (wow, what a nice twist).  Looking forward to the next one in the series when it comes out!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|In the true tradition of Ken Follett,  Excellence on all levels. Research, description of characters, and wonderful ability to describe the surroundings, and the feel of the time. It will grip you, and make you feel that you want to go there, and defend these people.  He is a master of description, and character analysis. Hated for it to end.
1451696191|5.0|FIRST OFF I WANT TO THANK DEJANA VULETIC FOR SEND ME THIS BOOK FOR MY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU SO MUCH :D<br /><br />i have heard so many amazing things about the perks of be a wallflower that i wanted to check it out and read it for myself. from the first page i already loved charlie i thought he was an amazing character from the start. as i was reading and we started learn more and more about charlie's life, we get to meet a cast of awesome characters there's charlies family his brother the football star and there's his sisters who is kind of just around and then there his his mom and dad how are just fun. and then we meet SAM and Patrick who are AWESOME CHARACTERS JUST SAYING. i loved Patrick because he was gay but he was not afraid for anyone to know it, plus he always had something funny to say which i really liked. then there is Sam who is the coolest girl you will ever meet she will always make you feel better when you are sad or are having a bad day. over all this was the best book i have read this year and now I'M DYING TO SEE THE MOVIE AND I CANT WAIT...<br /><br />P.S. THIS WAS MY FIRST CONTEMPORARY NOVEL I HAVE READ
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first saw this book at Wal-Mart, and I start reading it right then and there. Only 10 pages in, I was hooked. Charlie's innocent outlook on everything he writes about in his letters makes you think. This book left me feeling different, and only the best books [in my opinion] can do such a thing. Bravo, Stephen Chbosky. Bravo.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever because you can make pools,houses, and whatever you like to bulid .I recormend this game to cool people.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This movie made for one fun girls night out. We went to the late night viewing and it was mostly 20 & 30 somethings in the theater. We were all hooting and whistling for the guys like it was a *real* show! I didn't think it was the best story line ever, but it was very much a *REAL* story line. These are things you know can and will happen in real life - whether to guys or girls, it will happen. If you want a life experience movie with plenty of hot guys that know how to dance it's a must see! Or if you just flat out want to see a bunch of naked men dancing! ;-)
B004EBT6HE|2.0|Some of the characters are ok but the story line was really dragged out and not very beivable. Hard to beleive that Follett wrote this one!
B004Q3RDUW|4.0|I did not read the whole book.  It is too long and, at times, slow.  I ended up reading the synopsis of the on the Internet.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is perfect to me since it is pure and raw. no fancy writing just her life in her words
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not sure if I can write a very coherent review, nor do I think summing up my thoughts can do this story justice, as I literally stayed up all night reading books 1-5 after sampling the first book.  But I felt it was really deserving yet another positive review after reading such an amazing book.  I was surprised at how strongly I identified with the characters - triumphs and trials - and the plot was very intriguing; you will definitely want to know more.  I can't really say much about the plot without spoiling it, but I've seen people compare it to say - Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games - not quite the same, but I think if you liked that, you would enjoy this.
1612183956|5.0|The Pines is an extremely ambitious project and to a large extent it succeeds. As the author himself says, it was really twenty years in the making. It is certainly an archetypal page turner which grabs you right from the beginning when Ethan wakes up, lying in the open, with no memory of who he his or where he is. Personally I could hardly put the book down and read through it in a ridiculously short time.<br /><br />There are certainly echoes of other works which occurred to me as the story progressed. Probably the strongest was of the UK 1960s cult TV classic, [[ASIN:B002NB421C The Prisoner: The Complete Series]]. However, later on it had me thinking about H G Well's first novel,[[ASIN:0765351986 The Time Machine]] published in 1895. However, to make these parallels is really not to do this story justice as Blake Crouch has come up with quite a unique and eminently readable tale.<br /><br />The first half is strong and sets the scene as Ethan tries to make sense of life in Wayward Pines and has increasing difficulty in doing so. We then get on to the most frenetic stage of the book in a story which is all rather frenetic, and at that stage I found it harder to suspend disbelief, which is very necessary with this sort of fiction. However, the author pulls it all together for a very strong conclusion, and at that stage it all made perfect sense.<br /><br />This is a very impressive novel, and one which most readers will quickly get involved with and will be as keen as Ethan was to get some answers to what is happening. As one or two other reviewers have pointed out, this really would translate very well to a film or perhaps a TV series. Highly Recommended.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Wanted to be able to transfer pictures from camera SD card to my iPad. When it arrived I tried it immediately and it worked perfect.  very easy to use.
0316228532|4.0|It is difficult to write an interesting book about ordinary people.  However, ordinary people deserve to have their stories told.  The characters in The Casual Vacancy are ordinary people.  Some are ordinary middle-class  adult and teenage dwellers of pretty Pagford leading ordinary lives for their circumstances.  Others are ordinary classless adult and teenage dwellers of the neighboring run-down Fields public housing development leading ordinary lives for their circumstances.  Human suffering does not distinguish between class or age.  All suffer in The Casual vacancy.<br /><br />The most compelling character is impoverished, uncultured, barely-litterate Fields resident Krystal Weedon, a sixteen-year-old daughter of a drug addict mother and an unknown father.  Krystal's drive for life and her sense of responsibility for her three-year-old brother demonstrate that a person is not necessarily doomed by her circumstances but can with courage, mentoring, and luck potentially change the force of fate.  J.K. Rowling tells Krystal's story and the stories of the other dwellers of Pagford and the Fields with insight and compassion.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Ms. Reichs always give the reader a great read.  I have read everything she has written and have never been disappointed.  You really get to know her characters

0307474275|4.0|Thought provoking.  I feel like Dan Brown did enough research to make this a plausible story, certainly very controversial material.<br /><br />The mystery of the subject and how he uncovered each piece one clue and one colorful character at a time, kept me interested in finding what what would happen next.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Very good movie. Very well acted. Great special affects. I would give it 5 stars! This movie should get awards.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|If your looking for a CPU heatsink/fan for around $20 that does a great job this is the one! Not bad to install, have had it for many months and no issues what so ever.<br /><br />It is somewhat big, so make sure your case has room for it.<br /><br />Highly recommend this CPU cooler.
B009178OQA|5.0|I have been to Japan and have been fortunate to have had some incredible sushi.  This movie captures the experience up to a point.  The only thing missing is the actual experience in one's mouth!  Highly recommended to not only watch the movie but travel to experience the Sushi!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it so much.great time waster! I wish you guys could of thought of this sooner .... love it ...
B001BWYTAS|4.0|Really surprised at the heartless reviews here.  Not sure what people were expecting.  I found it delightful.  Took a chance on a used copy, and very pleased that I did.  Some people who were on the bus, and some everyday people who encountered it along the way, reminisce and tell stories.  Not sexy or druggie stories.  Just ordinary stories.  And to augment them, the film is packed with super 8 footage (and outtake photos) of the Beatles.  So what if you don't hear the Beatles performing Magical Mystery Tour songs?  We all own the album.  But who has ever seen these home movies of the trip?  As a bonus, Neil Innes shares the origin of \\"Death Cab For Cutie.\\"<br /><br />Geez, people, have a heart.  This is actually the most I've ever learned about what actually happened on the Magical Mystery Tour.  All the bios say, nothing much, and share nothing much as a result.  And, indeed, nothing essential DID happen for the band, or for rock historians looking for sordid details.  The magic was for the locals, and it was The Beatles themselves, coming to town with miraculous randomness, then disappearing.  And apart from John snubbing one hotel worker's autograph request, it looks like they were actually having a good time hob-nobbing.<br /><br />To echo one reminiscing passenger's suggestion, it really is too bad they didn't incorporate the incident of the bus getting stuck on a small stone bridge (holding up their caravan and 30 cars of traffic) into the film.  You'd think \\"the boys\\" might've appreciated the absurdity.<br /><br />I'm glad this was made.  And it's exactly what it says it is on the box (right down to, there are no Beatles performances in this film).  In fact, there was far more footage of the Beatles than I expected.  Thumbs up from here.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|I enjoy the new direction they're going with this Batman.  more realistic, updated the suit looks amazing and the art is fantastic.  ibdon't normally read these comics, but i may have to start

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book needs no consideration. Buy it. What an intimate look into the life of a fantastic human being. Thank goodness for Adam Brown. I have red a ton of SEAL memoirs and this one is the first one that made me cry. I feel comfortable saying that. This book is life-changing. This book, along with LONE SURVIVOR, are going to be a staple for my kids to read so they can understand overcoming adversity.

1568363931|4.0|It's pretty simple, and definitely a straight-forward guide to Bento. The pictures were beautifully done and evoked hunger, despite reading this late at night. I'd recommend it for anyone looking to learn about Bento, or anyone interested in traditional Japanese cuisine that is easy and quick to make.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely worth reading and in the end you can see how truly twisted some relationships can be and what people will do to convince others and themselves who they are.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|\\"The Five Year Engagemnt\\" is basically a re-hashing of \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" BUT LESS FUNNY. Jason Segel repeats his roll as the nice, sweet male character victimized by life & a powerful independent woman. He slides down from a successful career minded position in life to the basement level of loser-ness only to pick himself back up at the end; when he again realizes he's the person responsible for his life, which of course was & is a good one, in-fact better than most. ( And on a side note, what's with Jason Segel's need to write himself naked in all of his movies. He's not really eye candy for the women & us men sure as H_ _ _ don't need to see it. )
0743496736|4.0|\\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is a novel that kept me up well past my normal bedtime--and then woke me out of a sound sleep at 4 a.m. and said, \\"Read me. There's a lot more. You can't quit until you're done.\\"<br /><br />Small towns may seem peaceful, but many hold secrets that remain hidden until tragedy strikes.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult tell the riveting story of what happened to cause nineteen minutes of horror in an ordinary New Hampshire town.<br /><br />She melds several aspects of teen life together: peer pressure, sexuality, bullying, teens feeling of invincibility one minute, hopelessness the next, their withdrawal from parents.<br /><br />The author also dissects the complexities of adult relationships: between men and women--Lacy and Lewis, Alex and Patrick; women friends/mothers--Alex and Lacy.  Between teens--Peter and Josie, Josie and Matt.  And she shows what happen when they mix.<br /><br />The result is a must read.  It will touch hearts.  Infuriate some; chasten others.  It will open eyes that have been closed to possibilities they had not wanted to imagine. It will impart knowledge to minds uneducated in what is actually going on in American high schools.  Knowledge brings power.  Power brings change.  And --hopefully--in this way \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" can stop other disasters before they happen.
0316228532|2.0|I love how nearly every review either claims to be HP devotees or Never Read'em. No middle of the road here. Same with Ms. Rowling's sorry sophomore slump in THE CASUAL VACANCY. I have to think her success with the Harry Potter series made her such an untouchable icon to her editor that no one felt powerful enough to tell her \\"These characters really stink!\\" JK Rowling's uber success with Harry Potter was her ability to craft people the reader not only cared about; they were adored, wept over, debated, imitated...ad nauseum. I read this mediocre novel just waiting for redemption but feeling through out the entire piece of indestinguished drivel that the author strove with every detached description to be OPPOSITE of what made her great. As a result this novel was lacklustre, plain-vanilla, and somewhat amateurish. Back to the drawing board, Rowling, and find someone who isn't dazzled by your wealth and past to whip you back into writing shape!
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Once I get the hang of it, I'm sure its everything it says it is. Operational error, not product error. Helpful instruction booklet. easy to put together. Priced right. All in all, I'm glad I purchased it.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I read a Rolling Stone Magazine today that asked a writer of Breaking Bad how they made each character to a Schrodingers Cat. I don't know how many other sitcoms have done just that.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The best part was the beginning, when Reacher is in the car.  I loved how Reacher figured out so much by just paying attention - typical Lee Child.  It did get a bit slow in the middle (after the car) but then got good again in the last quarter or so.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have been using the app for Pininterest for about 2 weeks. At the beginning the app worked great but the last two or three days it has been force closing.
B008VBYN80|1.0|this game has lots of issues (unfixed bugs)and the people who manage it do a poor job at it. I purchased over 100 in diamonds and lost everything because the game stopped working and I had to delete the game and reinstall to make it work. when I installed it, I lost the progress plus the diamonds. other than that the  game is excellent if it didn't have the issues. oh last time I purchased 20 in diamonds the diamonds didn't go in so I didn't get them. I emailed the company and they told me to rest assured they will fix the issue,  well that was over 8 days ago.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is great.  I didn't think it could be so addictive.  It is a great time waster when at lunch or break at work.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|it is alittle hard and you have to by songs and some of them are really hard and very fast I like the app thoe
B008UG0JJI|5.0|Great DVD. Picture is right up there with Blu-Ray, really sharp with nice rich colors. No games, nice camera work. Nice shots of each musician. No choice for sound just automatically starts in LPCM stereo. Sound is superb, even with Blu-Ray I don't listen to the new codecs, LPCM is lossless also. For me surround is for movies. The sound is right up there with the best I've ever heard, if not the best I've heard on DVD or Blu-Ray. As for the music, just look at the group! Musical, technical & complex, doesn't get any better. I've seen her twice, once with this group & once with Steve Smith on drums. Great to see each musician from the perfect angle.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app! Its not necessary but it is fun and its a good reminder if you forget to glance up at the small battery bar!
0307720950|5.0|Preordered this book and read it as soon as I received it. Chris has done a great job chronicling an innovation revolution unfolding across the US - a \\"bottom up\\" creative movement led by thousands (if not millions) of grassroots Americans. Innovation has long been an exclusive activity practiced by an an elite group of R&D scientists and engineers. But with social media and the democratization of 3D printing, anyone can be an innovator today. You don't need too many resources to invent new stuff: All you need is a dash of ingenuity and plenty of resourcefulness. MacGyver - the beloved TV action hero - epitomized the Yankee ingenuity, with his uncanny ability to improvise solutions and extricate himself from any problem using merely duct-tape and a Swiss Army knife! Sadly, as innovation became more \\"structured\\" in the late 20th century, US companies lost touch with this frugal and flexible MacGyver spirit. Interestingly, as documented in my book Jugaad Innovation [...], the MacGyver spirit may have waned in Corporate America, but it is very much alive in...emerging markets like India, China, Brazil, and Africa where millions of grassroots entrepreneurs are catalyzing their own \\"Makers\\" movement by improvising simple but effective solutions to big social problems using limited resources. It's time we reclaim the MacGyver spirit in the US -- it's birthplace. The success of the MAKER FAIRE from Coast to Coast is evidence that the Yankee ingenuity is very much alive in America. Rather than being intimated by this swelling grassroots creative movement, US corporations needs to embrace/leverage it -- as Chris rightly points out in this book. GE's \\"GE Garages\\" initiative is a right step in that direction, but we need more Fortune 500 corporations to throw their weight behind the MAKERS movement which promises to unleash a new wave of sustainable economic growth in the US. Overall, this book is a great primer on the New Industrial Revolution fomented by grassroots inventors across America. I strongly recommend it...across America. I strongly recommend it...
B0098VYCCE|4.0|My wife probably liked the movie more than I did but I am not really an avid movie watcher. It was nice to have the movie available as a streaming through the Amazon service because, while more expensive than retail rentals, it's on demand and convenient. I found the movie to be quite a switch from the old cartoon versions but I'm sure that it was supposed to be. It was kinda dark and eerie. The acting was VERY good. I don't know that I would nominate \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" for any kind of awards as best movie of the year but I sat through it and I give it a good solid 4-star review for the acting, plot and special effects. With that said, however, it's definitely not a kid's movie.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher novels & have enjoyed all of them.  That being said, this latest novel was disappointing.  It moved very slowly, & the storyline was confusing & not very exciting.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I'll confess that I liked this version better than the \\"Snow White & The Huntsman\\" movie that I saw just a week before because it was a tad brighter and lighter than the \\"Huntsman.\\" I guess I was expecting both movies to be a more real-life enactment of the childhood Disney stories. I did like the bantering of the dwarves and their place within the story line, making it more fun to watch; however, was surprised that they took on the presence as self-centered and outcasts. All in all the movie left me a little SLEEPY but I'm HAPPY to give it a 4-star review.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Bought this to keep my grand-daughter's Barbie dolls and all the little items that go with it. Now she knows exactly where to find everything. And the inside of box makes a great house to play in. But be careful not to let the zipper seperate at the bottom end, as they don't bother to put stops on the teeth anymore.
B0086700CM|4.0|its challenge<br />to play but good intertament......<br />for all ages .<br />the game uses very good skills to keep u hopping
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great writer, he writes with great detail and has a perfect way of setting up the scene. The Pines started out as a thriller/suspense and ends as a sci/fi. But I thought it was pulled off wonderfully.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|To Miami Nights in response to your post.<br /><br /> The greatest part of this movie is not only the idea of love and equality, but also the simple idea that change is possible if you embrace it. This movie had me crying, laughing, and angry which is all cause and effect of a great movie. Everyone should see this movie no matter where you come from or who you are. It portrays life the way it really is without holding back. Who enjoys watching a movie when we all know the ending, or what's going to happen next? We love and hate true ending stories because most of them we know that it has to be done, but we can't bear to think that its going to actually be done. We as people naturally want to feel happy but as most of us know all to well tragedy is just as much a part of life as happiness. It is good that at the end of the movie they didn't have Walt do a complete 360 change and start loving all Hmong people, and become this completely self righteous man because in real life things just don't happen like that. Its good they showed how he developed a relationship with them but still kept most of his beliefs. This movie should have won awards regardless of the films first time actors sometimes they care more about how the movie is going then big name actors. It's always good to see a movie with a good message use first time actors it can help us connect better with the characters and it helps them get their names out there and maybe start a career themselves in the movie business. Regardless of the fact this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and it will continue to rain in my heart for years. This is a true to life story and will bring many to emotions to anyone who watches it. The fact that Walt can adapt and develop a relationship with those he despises the most is remarkable. It's ironic how the story's plays out as well. In the beginning Thao tries to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino which is how there relationship begins and at the end when Walt dies he gives his two things in life he cares about most to Thao his dog daisy and the 1972 Gran Torino. Its almost angelic at the end of the movie when Thao is driving the Gran Torino with daisy down the shore drive, and you hear Walt also known as Clint Eastwood singing the song called \\"Gran Torino,\\" making his presence known it gave me goose bumps.<br /> I would like to point out that Asian Americans are just as present today and have their own society, gangs, and even communities around the country. Most of them go unnoticed and some people don't even realize they exist, but they are here and they aren't going anywhere. It's very good that somebody took the time to shine the light on them and to show people that they are here. America is the biggest melting pot of any country and everyone has a right to be here to try and make a better living. Asian Americans are everyday people and deserve to be known as such. The stereotypes given to Asian Americans mainly come from movies that portray them wrongly, and hopefully because of Clint Eastwood more people will try to represent them more accurately. This was by far my favorite Clint Eastwood's best movie and its one of his best movies he has ever not only played a role in but directed as well. We all love Dirty Harry and Million Dollar Baby and the rest of his movies, but as far as the message he was trying to send with this particular movie it has hit home to a lot of people. There are two very important messages in this movie. The first one is love and care for those people in your life because life is too short and will pass you buy, and the second message is work hard and good things will come to you don't take the easy way out.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, it had lots of good action and it actually had some good messages that were subtly communicated through the movie.

B009329ZF2|5.0|This BLu-Ray is excellent. Movie theatre style graphics and audio. I would recommend it to anyyone seeking an exciting evening at home.

B004V9MU86|5.0|I've started to get a little bored of books set in Germany about World War II. Yes, I know that it was a huge event that affected day-to-day life, but I was looking for something different. When my friend recommended The Book Thief to me, she said I would like it because it's different, and she was right.<br /><br />Narrated by Death, this book is uniquely told from the beginning. Markus Zusak writes with a distinctly different voice, choosing beautiful turns of phrase that I couldn't bookmark fast enough. He was able to paint vivid scenes full of suspense and emotion that stayed with me well after I turned my Kindle off.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's terribly complex writing, but it's not exactly pick-up-and-scan material either; I found it easy to knock out chapters while commuting on the bus to and from work, but it certainly isn't something you read for the sake of reading. While I can't compare this to a similar book, I can say this: If you're sick of WWII tales, you'll be pleasantly surprised by The Book Thief.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|loved it cant wait for the next one when is it coming or is it out already? if anyone knows would like to know
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very well done. prizes and puzzle keep you coming back to play again and again. physics are pretty realistic as well.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|This Hyde Park show is phenomenal. It's the next best thing to being in the \\"pit\\" at a Springsteen show. A great combination of songs such as \\"Badlands,\\" \\"Rosalita,\\" \\"Glory Days,\\" and \\"American Land,\\" plus terrific arrangements of \\"She's the One,\\" \\"Johnny 99\\" and \\"Good Lovin.\\" Also, killer version of \\"No surrender\\" with guest Brian of Gaslight Anthem. I never get tired of watching this show. I wouldn't have changed a song in the lineup. They flow together seamlessly. And let's not forget the Big Man's brilliance in one of his last recorded performances with the E Street Band.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I loved CrossMe so I was thrilled to see CrossMe Color.  I have to admit it took me awhile to figure CrossMe out but once I did I am utterly hooked. I am dreading running out of puzzles.  This game (not really a game but still) is very challenging, it really makes you think.  And count :)
0385536828|5.0|Ian McEwan's newest novel, \\"Sweet Tooth,\\" is a complicated story set in England in the late 1960s and early 1970s as the Cold War is coming to an end. The government investigative/spy business is trying to find ways to continue. In particular, the group, MI5 decided to set up a foundation that would support a variety of writers who would presumably write anti-communist work without knowing the actual source of their funding grants. One of the \\"agents\\" sent out to recruit a writer is Serena Frome, the novel's narrator. Serena meets and signs up her assigned target, Tom Healy, an up and coming novelist who soon becomes more than her client. Because she is dealing in subterfuge, she is unable to tell Tom what her real position is. This leads to a convoluted series of ramifications.<br /><br />Among the most interesting aspects of this novel are the stories Tom Healy writes. They are contained in the novel as stories within the plot, but the reader gets to enjoy them along with Serena as she peruses his work. Another interesting aspect is McEwan's use of a female protagonist and attempting to see the issues involved from feminine point of view.<br /><br />It is a novel with a lot of depth, both in character development and in plot. I would recommend it, especially to readers who have enjoyed McEwan's earlier books. It would also make a fascinating book group discussion choice.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|It's been my second book by Grisham recently and I have to say it's really intoxicating. It took me 4 days to read it though I'm not a native speaker.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was so much fun. it was long enough and made me think. it was well worth what I paid.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|A disappointing installment in the Resident Evil series.  At this point, it's all about the fighting, no plot required.  They simply alternated the mad tussles with travel sequences, the idea being put Alice (Milla Jovovich) in places where she can fight, move on, fight, move on...............  Nothing is resolved, there are still an endless number of zombies roaming freely while the Umbrella Corporation shows no signs of letting up (why should they when they have an unrealistic number of soldiers at their disposal).  It's an excess of absurdity with only pockets of humanity left, caught between the two raging hordes.  I'm left wondering just what the objective of the Umbrella Corporation is, it's not as if they've any consumers left.  The few stragglers are kidnapped for experimentation.  World domination is hardly worth the effort.  Soon they will be fighting each other.  Until then, do they expect Alice to carry on while cities still burn, a variety of mutant zombie creatures show up, and people still need rescuing.  Will she be doing this with a walker, a geriatric soldier of misfortune?  I'm beginning to wonder.<br /><br />In this episode, Alice takes a meandering journey to reach another holdout of humanity, trapped in a prison.  This new cast is quickly disposed of, no chance for their personalities to register, a meager body count.  The bad guy/special guest star villain is just a smirk in dark glasses, a reject from the Matrix (did they forget which movie series they were making?), caught sitting on a throne  no less.  I laughed, I don't think I was supposed to.<br /><br />The first film still remains my favorite, the rest pale, I've kept them anyway, this one too, and I will keep watching them.  I can always fast-forward through the dull bits.  Maybe, eventually, they will get it right again.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Great CD!  \\"Train\\" CD's always provide music that you can listen too repeatedly, and often.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates music from Train.

0525953728|5.0|A very well-written book that I read straight through because I could not put it down! I understand concerns over whether the author leaked classified information and methods.  Those concerns, however, are now hollow given that the administration did the same and more - actually oversaw preparation of a movie.  If you ask me, all this - the book and the government pr - should have followed WWII-era procedures and waited a few years (e.g., first book about D-Day with government cooperation - The Longest Day - didn't appear until the late 1950s, I think). But there's nothing we can do about it now. One difference from the Bergen account that caught my eye - the CIA analyst who gets the credit in the Bergen book for staying on the case and seeing it through is one \\"John.\\"  Yet here, the primary CIA analyst involved is a woman. Bergen really should have credited her work as well (using a pseudonym, of course). And I say this regardless of gender.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just like the first book.....OMG!!!!! I start reading it and cant put it down.  I cant wait to start the third one!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Many of these &agrave;pps do not automatically go into landscape mode. I have a case that lies sideways and would like all these apps to auto flip
0525953728|5.0|Absolutely outstanding.  These has an authentic, realistic characteristic throughout the book.  I enjoyed this factual account and how the author works around the area that are classified, ie helicopter tail rotor mechanism used.  I have sent this to my son so he can enjoy it.
B00422LESO|3.0|This was such a delightful, fluffy book. Our heroine, Jane, has the opportunity to visit Pembrook Park (aka the Austenland from the title) which indulge wealthy Jane Austen obsessed women with a charming Regency era fantasy for 3 weeks, complete with an adapted persona. Jane has to learn the social customs of the time period as well as trying to figure out how to interact with her fellow guests and actors of the estate. Will Jane find her Mr. Darcy or will Pembrook Park encourage her to live the 21st century life? Well, I know I enjoyed the fun romp to find out the answer!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoyed this app and recommend it to everyone young and old...never a dull moment but just wished the coins accumulated faster!
B0088TG252|4.0|At times the movie dragged, but it was enjoyable. Like Denzel movies and he has made quite a few good ones in past few years.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|No problem downloading and watching this.  My kids, 3 & 5, mostly liked it, although my 3 year old just told me he \\"didn't like Ratatouille\\" while on a Disney cruise (but he loves Cars).  We try to keep violent content to a minimum in films we let the kids watch and this one was pretty good (just a couple scenes that scared them a bit).
0812992792|5.0|Adam Johnson's The Orphan Master's Son is so finely observed and carefully wrought a novel - \\"novel\\": this time, the word seems both perfect and perfectly inadequate - of North Korea today that it might have begun its life as history or journalism, except for the fact that it is wholly the work of the author's imagination. True, Johnson made a brief, carefully chaperoned trip to North Korea, and many of his facts and vignettes, such as the kidnappings from Japan or the detailed accounts of North Korean prison life, draw on written sources. But as is the case with North Korea and its Stalinist approach to \\"truth\\" in general, the line here between fact and fiction is imperceptible, and it's a credit to Johnson's art that he transforms the otherwise wholly unbelievable into something quite plausible, believable, even, we must wonder, perhaps authentic. And so it is that one prize-winning journalist/East Asianist who writes with special authority on North Korea, Barbara Demick - whose book \\"Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea\\" drew on nine trips to the North and seven years of discussions with North Koreans - says Johnson has \\"managed to capture the atmosphere of this hermit kingdom better than any writer I've read.\\"<br /><br />Others have discussed the book's character, events, and particulars. I don't think I can comment on the book's contents or plot in any detail without spoiling it for others. I'll just note that Johnson creates mystery and certainly drew me in, gradually, to an unconventional, non-chronological journey of discovery, told in three voices - the eponymous tunnel rat, official kidnapper, and intelligence officer Park Jun Do (isn't his given name reminiscent of \\"John Doe\\"); the nameless interrogator and biographer who chronicles the second half of the book; and the blaring impersonal voice of The Regime, the official propaganda \\"chorus\\" that comments on the action out of the loudspeaker in every North Korean home, workplace, and public space. The result is a fiercely realized version of a world about which 99 percent of his readers will know nothing, or surely very little, and a complex web of interwoven lives lived in a world we can scarcely imagine.<br /><br />Isn't that the very thing many of us hope to find when we crack open a book?<br /><br />The range of Johnson's invention is near miraculous, down to the consistently strange expressiveness and turns of phrase of colloquial English as its sounds coming from North Korean sources (read the English-language version of Rodong Sinmun and you'll know what I mean) and a chilling portrait of the \\"Dear Leader\\" - yes, one of Johnson's central characters and reminiscent of Solzhenitsyn's Stalin in \\"The First Circle.\\" But most marvelous of all are Johnson's convincing distillation of humanity amid what must strike the reader as madness and the many ways in which he explores, imagines, and depicts the minds of people struggling for survival in a world for which there is little or nothing to live.<br /><br />All that said, this book is not for all tastes. It's literary, even (horrors) META-literary. It causes the reader to puzzle, to grapple with ambiguity, to confront moral dilemmas out of context. Like viewers of a David Lynch movie, readers may wonder \\"where in the world are we here?\\" and feel a need to suspend the human desire for narrative closure. In the end, I found the book's narrative logic compelling and the payoffs powerful, all loose ends knotted, and not in particularly pat ways. Johnson's North Korea is complex, with wheels within wheels, and resolution isn't going to be clean and neat.<br /><br />For me, The Orphan Master's Son stands as something of a miracle of human creation, with a compelling portrait of another species of human creation - a systematically horrific one - from which we'd rather avert our eyes but, in this telling, cannot..

B007L24T52|3.0|The first 70 pages or so are really boring. The last 50 pages or so are like a fairy tale but in between is a real thriller... most of it. So if you read this one don't expect the greatest reading of your life.

1597801585|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi has created a fascinating dystopian world in his book The Windup Girl.  The world itself is previously explored in Bacigalupi's collection of shorts [[ASIN:1597802026 Pump Six and Other Stories]] which is also well worth reading.<br /><br />The story itself is dark as one would expect from a fiction set in a time where genetic manipulation has gone awry and global warming has done its worst on the world's coastlines.  The date is not specified, but it doesn't feel very far away.<br /><br />Bacigalupi follows several different characters across a future Thailand in a city where dykes and pumps keep out an ocean ready to take over at a moment's notice.  In addition the city is a closed off refuge from the corporations that have taken control of the world's food supply, calorie companies as they are called in the book.  These calorie companies control most of the world's energy and food supply and are eager to open new markets.  The story revolves around what happens when greed and a lust for power overwhelm common sense.  A common enough scenario, but made all the more interesting by the setting Bacigalupi chooses to build around them.<br /><br />Recommended without equivocation.
0316227706|5.0|You don't have to be a dog lover (which I am) to enjoy this wonderful book.  Every page makes me smile, or laugh out loud. Seth shows us a side of dogs that most of us don't get to see. Every picture portrays the joy that the dogs feel for what they're doing.  I would think Seth has one of the best jobs in the world!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs.  Or as a gift to someone who needs a smile.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I love a good mystery that keeps you guessing & surprises you in the end. At the end I just wanted back the time I wasted reading this. Didn't like the format, plot or characters. If it had been a paperback I would have thrown it away. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was that I did keep reading it, but only because I thought surely it would get better & come to a reasonable conclusion. Neither one happened. Unless you can get it free at the library don't waste your money on it.
B008D36INE|1.0|Slow and pointless. I could not sit still and watch it. It took me three days. I paid for it, so I had to Finnish it but it was torture.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|These movies are great, but I have to admit that I didn't like them the first time around.  I think that's because I was expecting them to at least resemble the original Ludlum books, but let's face it - these are only \\"Bourne\\" movies in the sense that there are a few names that are the same, and a couple of similar scenarios.  The plots have almost nothing to do with the original books.  But once I got over that and looked at these movies as a completely independent creation (that just happened to share their names with a book franchise that I love), I was able to really appreciate just how great these movies are.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The film is really rubbish, it had some great potential based on the previous Alien films, this \\"prequel\\" has let the rest down badly. Maybe there will be more to come and this is just the Jar Jar Binks of the prequels??<br />In any case not worth paying for at any rate, if one of your friends has actually paid for the dvd/bluray then borrow it from them and when you are really bored and have no other options to spend your time doing something more interesting then watch it.
B009329Y30|3.0|I love Zac Ephron in this film as a soft spoken, sexy, sort of shell shocked marine. The actress that plays Beth is new I suppose because I've never seen her in any movies accept The Lucky One. She's talented and has wonderful chemistry with Zac's character Logan -- I just wish more of the details from Nich Sparks's book were in this film. I don't want to add spoiler alert to my review, so I'll just say this movie is a good effort at a summarized version of the novel. In the novel the love story is so much more enchanting. Good Try. Worth seeing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok, this was an extremely well written book, not overly done with detail but with enough to visualize what's happening. I found it fast paced and I didn't want to put it down. Only took me a few hours to read. The characters are well develpoed and its plot is exciting....
034580404X|5.0|They were absolutely a wonderful read. Was delivered quickly and in excellent shape. It was the best read Ive had in quite awhile.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|1) When are we finally going to get a release date for this? It's OCTOBER - to still not even know when to expect this is ridiculous.<br /><br />2) Enough with all the \\"it's not exactly like the books\\" blah blah. Of course it's not. Were you really expecting otherwise? As with any adapation of a book to the screen, you need to evaluate each independently. And in my opinion, if you forget about the books, and just look at this series for what it is, it's excellent.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I kept hearing so much hype about this book and all of my friends telling me I just had to read it. I held off forever and finally gave in. I should've stuck with my better judgement. The story is so bad that I couldn't even finish reading it. Like many others say it seems like a young teenager is telling ths story because of all the immature thoughts and sayings. It was just bad, bad, bad. Won't be reading anymore of this series.
6304698682|5.0|Great movie...Have seen it so many times, but had to have another copy..Clint Eastwood is wonderful, as usual in this...Will buy more of his classic movies.

B007THA4FI|2.0|If this had been written by anyone other than J.K. Rowling, I NEVER would have finished it.  The first quarter of the book was truly awful.  I hated all the characters and there were way too many of them to keep track of, as well as the book just being filled with unnecessary vulgarity.  However, at about the 1/2 way point I realized I didn't hate it anymore and by 70% done, I was actually enjoying it and wanted to find out how it ended.<br /><br />Once I got the characters straight in my head, I really liked the way she transitioned from one character to the next.<br /><br />Had I only read the first half of the book, it would have gotten 1 star.  After finishing it, I decided it deserved slightly better.<br /><br />If Rowling writes another adult book, I will most likely not purchase, but read for free from the library.  Definitely wait to read a sample instead of pre-ordering like I did this time.  (I highly considered returning it after 10%).<br /><br />If she goes back to children's lit, it's an automatic pre-order for me...although I don't think it's possible to ever come close to HP.  Her writing style in those books was just so wonderful and the intricacies of the plot from book 1 through book 7 still amaze me to this day.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be great if she did a book from the Malfoy's perspective?!
0345803485|1.0|First I'm glad I borrowed this book and didn't buy it or else I'd probably be pissed.<br /><br />The complaints about the writing are valid, and I won't spend any more time repeating what many others have said. Those that have loved this book and series I have to conclude are the types of people who don't read a lot so this was exciting for them. I'm sorry if that hurts someone's feelings, but this book was so poorly written that to get some of the accolades it has is just shameful. I have to wonder if the education of this country is showing through when this quality of work does so well. Maybe texting and instant messaging really is destoring something in society.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This book was just too much sex, and too little story. It could have helped if the book was labelled erotic.  I have no problem with erotic, but I don't want to read a book of so many pages of just sex.  Not sure if I will order the other books in the series.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This first volume in a trilogy certainly leaves the reader looking forward to more.  Mr. Rothfuss has sharpened his storytelling skills to a razor sharp edge.  Kvothe is a compelling and believable character, with flaws, gifts and quirks that bring him to life page by page.  The world Mr. Rothfuss has created is like another character in the story, and seems both familiar and foreign at the same time, giving the reader the opportunity to be immersed in each scene.<br /><br />His follow-up book, The Wise Man's Fear, adds to the depth and breadth of the story in delightful and surprising ways.  The author has not just slapped paint on a canvass and called it art.  He has painstakingly worked to create something beautiful, thought provoking and worthy of critical acclaim.  I look forward with great anticipation to the final book in the trilogy being released and what other stories lurk in the creative mind who brought Kvothe to life.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Rothfuss, for a story well told.

0887307280|4.0|Michael Gerber's biography calls him a small business legend and guru. His career and his businesses are designed to help budding entrepreneurs succeed, and this book is Gerber's manifesto. I read this book to begin my own self-education in running a small business. Even if I never start or own one, it's helpful to understand what makes a business successful.<br /><br />E-Myth is divided into three sections, each teaching a new lesson. First, that we each have three personalities that must be balanced to be successful in business: entrepreneur, manager, and technician. Second, that consistent, repeatable processes are more important than the product. Third, that it is important to develop a solid business model from the very start.<br /><br />This book was helpful to me, even before I've begun any business. I was grateful for the lesson that a successful business is one that you can walk away from, come back a month later, and find it running just as well. As Gerber writes, \\"If your business depends on you, you don't own a business-you have a job.\\" (40).<br /><br />I also appreciated Gerber's instruction that a successful business depends far more on its owner's commitment to learning than any brilliantly novel product. As he writes, people who are exceptionally good in business have an insatiable need to know more.<br /><br />If you're looking to learn about small businesses or hoping to improve your own business, E-Myth is a great place to start.
1250010489|5.0|Brilliant book, a must read for any one that likes action, computers, and a small dose of romance<br />The story has a good steady build up, by the second half is an unstoppable rollercoaster - not many books have gripped my attention like this one, and like Zero Day before it.<br /><br />Great job Mark - looking forward to the next instalment.

0307387178|5.0|Jon Krakauer does an excellent job at back tracking the expedition of one Chris McCandless. This includes the route McCandless took from his home and all the friends and people he met along the way. The author additionally addresses another theme which was constantly in the back of my mind all the time as I was reading the book: Is it really possible for a man to scrape so-called civilized society off one's shoe and live far and away and alone? For many folks when we think of this kind of life in nature we are directed towards reading that of Henry David Thoreau's \\"Walden\\" which, unfortunately is inaccurate, yet  McCandless even had a copy of that classic book with him during his journey. If we take a closer look at Walden the reality was that Thoreau lived in a cabin that was situated only a few miles out of town, as well he had friends and family bring him things he needed. Thoreau certainly was not living independently of society, yet this is the over romantic story that gets presented to us when we think of getting off the status-quo hamster wheel and living soley from nature. This is where Into The Wild becomes the true benchmark document on what it means to try to live off of the land.<br /><br />In the final analysis this story shows the reader that there are many self essentials that one needs for basic survival that go back to the era of eons ago: that of the hunter-gatherer and semi agrarian. Krakauer also points out: What does one do when one becomes ill? Had McCandless been with someone to help him during his stint in Alaska he would be alive today, but instead he died of something that was in fact not life threatening if he had access to medical assistance.<br /><br />In addition to a well detailed story of a man's desire to become separate from the human tribe, what one can learn from this chronology is that going at it alone is anything but an easy task and requires skills, as well as physical and mental strength. This is why I find Into The Wild a very compelling book and an excellent read for anyone thinking of becoming a lone ranger. For those who understandably want to get away from the modern world, I don't yet have the answer, but one should read this book before deciding to simply wing it out there in the wilderness.
B001JIAK66|5.0|Very entertaining and fun to watch. Great film for Halloween if you are looking for entertainment without the usual gore gushing in every scene.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|As is the case in all good suspense thrillers, cannot tell what is happening until near the end.  Great hooks along the way - enjoy the ride.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not one of the best Lee Child novels.  Entertaining, but a little bit too far-fetched, even for Jack Reacher.  However, like all of them, still worth a read.
B00846REIS|3.0|Very similar to 50 Shades of Grey, almost felt like a copy cat.  However, entertaining and easy to read.  I would reccomend it to others.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I don't generally write reviews as books are extremely personal. I do make it a point to read Amazon reviews as the reviewers could be your next door neighbor or another published author.  I was introduced to JK Rowling by my two nieces & loved every book.  This book is nothing like those novels.  Readers need to forgot who wrote the book in order to allow this novel to be viewed on it's on merits.  Yes, there are a lot of characters, but unless you work alone in your home, most of us touch the lives of countless others in our daily routines. And yes, many of the characters are unlikeable, but we all know unlikeable people, some of us ARE unlikeable people.  That said, after being introduced to the characters and how their lives were interwoven, it was very hard to put the book down.  (I am one who will read a few chapters, and if not engaged, will stop reading and move on to a new book.)  I didn't like these people, I felt pity and disgust for them, but I needed to see how their lives intertwined until the final page. I was not disappointed.
1433502410|5.0|A very well done Study Bible. Very good and useful maps and pictures. I like that you get free access to the online version of that Study Bible once you purchased the paper verion. It would be even better if you can a free electronich version eg for an i-pad if yourbuy the paper version.
B006ZTY07Y|5.0|Sheldon and Amy or \\"the Shamy\\" have great comedic chemistry. My favorite episodes are 'the recombination hypothesis' and 'the wiggly finger catalyst'. I can watch these over and over again, it is so hilarious. Just makes me happy!
B00338QENI|3.0|This was given as gift.  I did not read it myself, the individual to whom I gave it has not commented on it.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Often considered one of the best if not the best musical of all time, Singing in the Rain certainly does shine in this new edition! Like a lot of early technicolor films the process lends itself to digital cleaning, mastering, and sound. One can only hope more films will get this treatment if only to preserve its historical value. To a collector this one is a must own and is lovely to see in its new luster. Features are okay with a tribute with Glee cast and others that will seem dated as time goes on but the focus on the players with Debby Reynolds is pretty good. Previous editions seemed a bit more timely. still worth the price!
B004HMTCNS|5.0|This is another in the continuing series of \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" series that I love.  The character development in these books is outstanding, and I am totally engaged in the story.  As with the others, I didn't want to put it down.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome fun for a lazy Sunday afternoon. The game has a nice balance of mystery story, hidden pictures, and moving parts puzzles. The graphics are pretty and the soundtrack is appropriate. The two join to set a good eerie mood as a backdrop to the story. In all, this provides an engaging and entertaining game that is the best value I have gotten for a dollar in quite some time.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I am sure its been said many time before, but this film is a visual feast, just don't pay attention to the script which is riddled with gaping potholes and poor character motivation.<br /><br />The trailer for the film is 5 stars. The film itself is an unfortunate letdown.
B005LAJ212|4.0|I was reluctant to watch this show because I had heard it was like a daytime soap, and I can't stand soaps. That is the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars. I watched the first two episodes and I was hooked. I take each episode with a grain of salt and forgive the soap aspect of it when Emily goes through with one of her acts of revenge. It has been my \\"TV guilty pleasure\\" and I am looking forward to the next season.

B0067EMFLA|5.0|I found this album by I-Tunes releasing the first single, \\"Make a Move\\" as the free song of the week.  I really dug the single, so I checked out the rest of the album.  I have to say that this is my top new favorite album in several years - I listen to it so much it has cracked my Ipod's Top 25 played playlist.<br /><br />I'm not good at classifying genres of music - IFH is just GOOD MUSIC.  Every song on this album is good - not a bad one in there.<br /><br />I've been fortunate enough to see Icon in two live shows - and their energy is off the charts.  They put on a great live show and showcase this music wonderfully.<br /><br />I'm almost worried about their up-coming second album because this one is so good, I'd find it hard to top.<br /><br />And just to give you a little background on my musical tastes - my all time favorite band going back to my high school days is Garbage.  Icon really lives up to that standard....and even surpasses it - given Garbage's latest, Not My Kind of People, which I was very disappointed in.
B008M34INW|4.0|Entertaining flick.  Not as humorous as the previews led me to believe, but a\\"good\\" Mel Gibson none the less. Would recommend it to action lovers.
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I love Bon Iver and got a great price at Amazon on this album!  It's nice to listen to music that goes beyond the mainstream and actually has some depth to it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Game was great fun &amp; moved along nicely.  I. had some trouble getting it loaded, but I think that was due more to the amount of memory on my Kindle.  Once it loaded I. couldn't put it down!
B004I2K4E8|1.0|This performance did not touch my heart.<br />I think the 10th Anniversary concert at the Royal Albert Hall is the best in every aspect.<br />By the way, the disc is made in Mexico and there is no booklet.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this book difficult to read.  I was not at all happy with the lack of a true ending.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades is controversial because it goes against the grain of political correctness when it comes to men-women interactions and it is anathema to much that the feminist movement has achieved so far.<br /><br />Many men and women don't get it when it comes to human sexuality.  The Chinese have long cherished the concept of Yin and Yang (female vs male force) to maintain a good balance.  Yin feminine energy (cool/soft/shady) is nurturing and supportive while Yang masculine energy (hot/hard/bright) is powerful and independent.  The cult followers of S&M and many in the gay and lesbian community get it as their relationships often encompass \\"dominant\\" and \\"passive\\" partners to create a certain dynamic and tension.<br /><br />Many young women want an equal partnership and consequently everything is divided 50:50 - finances, housework, child minding, etc.  New Age young men also thought the division was logical.  Years on, this has given rise to metrosexuals and men with smooth waxed bodies and shaved underarms. Then women discover that they are not finding marital bliss in the bedrooms because he is too much like her!<br /><br />Over the years, symptoms of something going amiss in men-women relationships are eg:<br /><br />1. On an Oprah show years ago, the audience was asked what they want in a man.  A gutsy young black female answered with no hesitation that she wants a man who \\"knows how to put her in her place.\\"  If the same thought was expressed by a man, feminists would have castrated him on the spot!<br /><br />2. A British best seller written by a woman, from recall, advocates that women should \\"let the men take charge.\\"  Let men make the decisions and hand over the control of her money/earnings to him.  Sounds radical but more important is to understand the rationale or the logic of the advice.<br /><br />3. A recent social study found that in relationships where there is an equal split of the housework, there is a higher divorce rate over those where the housework is unevenly divided.  My take is that the latter is more of the man-on-top stance where the woman is the primary homemaker while the man is the hunter/main breadwinner.<br /><br />Fifty Shades creates the traditional man dominant and girl submissive fantasy that a lot of women want.  Such politically incorrect sentiments are made more palatable with love.  Young virgin has fallen head over heel for Mr Grey and his cold cruel heart is awakened to the possibility of love.<br /><br />Fans of Fifty Shades take note.

B00006JKOM|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable, musically and lyrically complex albums that JT ever did.  Ian is amazing - I have adored this album for 36 years.  It is, to put it quite simply, superb.  AND it was a good deal and arrived promptly and in mint condition.
0930289234|5.0|I'm a thirtysomething father of two who grew up reading comics.  Somewhere in my twenties I dropped out of the comicverse in a quest to succeed in the \\"real world.\\"  Perhaps it was childhood nostalgia, perhaps it was watching Phineas and Ferb with my kids, perhaps it was just time, but I recently set myself to reading one comic a month until I satisfied my illustrated urges.  Watchmen was the comic I chose first.<br /><br />Why Watchmen?  Because I was too busy reading GI Joe and Punisher when it originally came out, not that I would've \\"got it\\" when it did.  And because for years now I've known of its reputation.  So like the art enthusiast perpetually taking sidelong glances at the Louvre, I decided finally to buy a ticket and see the Mona Lisa with my own eyes.<br /><br />She did not disappoint.  Like da Vinci's most famous painting, Watchmen operates simultaneously on multiple levels of complexity.  How many comics are able to integrate a comic-within-a-comic pseudo-commentary without falling flat on their face or diving into self-parody?  Great works of fiction force their readers to search inside themselves for answers to the questions they ask, and Watchmen is no different.  Does the black and white morality of Rorschach have a place in our modern world?  Or does Ozymandias' moral relativism rule the day?  Do vigilantes really offer justice?  How much is one life worth?  Is the Comedian a hero or a villain?  Is there such a thing as either?<br /><br />Moore has crafted a masterpiece of plot, character, and narrative, and Gibbons' cinematic artwork matches him step for step.  Never in a comic have I seen story and art complement each other so well.<br /><br />Watchmen deals with timeless themes, and the astute reader will see parallels with today's headlines throughout the story.  The individual vs. the group.  Security vs. privacy.  Technological advancement vs. ethics.  Every story thread of Watchmen resonates with the tensions of today.  It eschews simple solutions, instead forcing the reader to choose a side.<br /><br />And that decision ultimately says more about the reader than it does the story, which is the mark of great fiction.
0316228532|4.0|I know I cannot be alone in my thinking, as soon as sudden death occurred I was expecting a guest appearance by Harry attempting to capture the evil creature inflecting death an suffering on the muggles, but 60 pages in and still no Harry.  Very upsetting.
0345803485|2.0|Not that this is a new Bronte novel, but \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" isn't nearly as badly written as some of its worst critics claim. It actually is fairly readable with a reasonable story arc. The exception is the obnoxiously repetitive use of the same words (flush, hitch, quirk) to describe Anna's blushing, her breathing interruptions and the movement of Christian's eyebrows or mouth. The book's subject - the acceptance of a sexually submissive role by a girl next door - makes it tantalizing. It is this naughty, transgressive subject that is causing the record book sales. Short summary: Anna Steele, an about-to-graduate college senior, meets Christopher Grey, a young, super-handsome, super-rich and super-talented business tycoon. They fall under each other's spells, and start an intense romance. Trick is, Anna is a sexual neophyte, while Grey is an experienced sexual partner with an exclusive taste for dominance games.<br /><br />The book has two issues: believability and consistency. We are supposed to believe that 21-year-old Anna is so innocent that a) she has never had sex and b) that she has never had a strong attraction for a boy. Not that she's an introvert or an intellectual. She is just the typical, beautiful, empty-headed college coed waiting for Prince Charming to ride by on his white steed. But when he does ride by, she is not immediately repelled by his continual commands (\\"Sit!\\" \\"Eat!\\") nor by his whips and contracts and restraints. And consistency, that hobgoblin of small minds, never makes an appearance. Anna is besotted with Christopher, then snaps at him about some trifle. Her subconscious (a tiny female character that lives in her head) is alternatively school-marmish and whiskey-a-go-go. And Anna, the sexual innocent (she refers to her genitalia as \\"down there\\") is brazenly willing to try just about anything the first time. All because she wants to please Christopher. Aw! And Christopher, supposed control freak, allows Anna to mess up his plans and question him endlessly. He makes a big deal about always sleeping alone, but then sleeps with Anna on their first date. The biggest whiplash in the book is not from Christopher's \\"red room of pain,\\" but from the continual shifts in character development.<br /><br />\\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is a beauty-and-the beast tale written with the kinky details of a Penthouse Forum article and the depth of a soft drink commercial.  (At one point, Anna drinks a cranberry-and-tonic that Grey leaves for her, exuding that it \\"tastes great and is so refreshing!\\") It's the kind of book that has you skipping the banal expository material to get to the action scenes. Take 10 minutes in the aisle of your local book store to skim it and find out what the fuss was about. Then put it back, leaves slightly moistened, back on the shelf. That's a good girl.estion him endlessly. He makes a big deal about always sleeping alone, but then sleeps with Anna on their first date.

B007BZM30M|5.0|Cute song for the summer. Makes you bop and sing along. Tune that sticks in your head till you hear it again.
0062060554|4.0|I decided to pick this up based on recommendations from others.  I will say that I wasn't impressed right off the bat. I think it might start a little slow.  In retrospect this was probably necessary to properly develop the story.  At first I thought it would be like the movie 50 first dates, except not a comedy.  It doesn't take long for this to take a completely different turn.  it develops into an interesting story.  It keeps you guessing.<br /><br />Bottom line--I'm glad I picked this up. It was a good read.  I would recommend it.  If you think its a little slow at first, give it a chance to develop.  It doesn't take long and it is worth it.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|The fact that we get Blu Ray and DVD together automatically makes this the perfect purchase. In addition to that, the show continues to engage the viewer and keep them guessing as to what's going to happen next. I can't tell you the last time my jaw was literally on the floor but the end of this season has been torturing me all summer, waiting for Season 4 to begin.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I won't go into great detail...plenty of other well written reviews you can get details from.  As a child Snow White always scared me.  AS an adult I have never liked movies with as much artistic leeway as this movie offers, but the more I watch it the more I like it.  There is something for everyone in Mirror, Mirror.  I absolutely adore Snow White.  No matter what situation she is in, she is true to being a princess in every way.  The creativity behind this movie astonishes and intrigues me.  The dwarfs are absolutely charming and brilliant.

B009AJDDQU|1.0|I'm not gonna go on and on about the movie. There are plenty of bad reviews here that relay my feelings of this horrible movie. One tidbit I will add is the absurdity of two characters...one was a geologist...that wanted to go back to the ship instead being involved in this momentous occasion of discovering life on another world. Just ridiculous.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day<br />  First, let me say, I never served in the US Military. I was a Vietnam era guy and sat out the war with a bad shoulder and asthma. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what these guys do, and while I know I could never personally do this, I sleep better at night knowing these guys are on OUR side. Reading this book only deepened my appreciation of their service and sacrifice.<br />  That said, I believe this is probably the best representation of what happened that night and satisfied my desire for the truth. It would have been unnecessary to write had the Administration put their act together and issued ONE single story for public consumption. There was a firefight in the courtyard, wait no, it was in his bedroom upstairs, but he had a gun, wait, he was near a gun, but hiding behind a woman... all in some twisted sense of trying to be politically correct.<br />  The US Navy SEALS are not politically correct. They are our elite Warrior Class, the dogs of war, the Kraken we release when the ultimate brute force we can unleash is required to defend our best interests. It will be quick, it will be violent and there will be a body count. They are not your local law enforcement agency and required to operate within a specific set of rules. It's war, and they bring it.<br />  While I felt appreciation and respect for what they do and all they endure, I was frankly outraged at the changes they have been forced to accept in recent years. The parts that talked about procedural changes from `surprise and destroy' to `surround and arrest/detain' made me rethink a lot of political issues here at home. Expecting SEALS to surround a compound, use a bullhorn to give all inside an opportunity to surrender first, confiscate their weapons, arrest them only later to have them released to be arrested again... well, it is disheartening and answers the question as to why this war goes on and on...<br />  This is a MUST read, and one you SHOULD read before the November election!lection!

B008CP93S0|3.0|Pretty mindless entertainment. I like Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd and, of course, Alan Alda.  But, the storyline is a silly premise with caricature characters.  No spoilers, here, but the end is no surprise.  Wait for addition to Amazon Prime Instant Video Library before viewing this one.  $1.99 on a weekend sale was $1.99 too much.

B001AGXEAG|5.0|If this is what the afterlife is going to be like then I guess it won't be so bad when it's my time though gotta stay away from anyone like Beetlejuice.  Tim Burton movies are an a acquired taste while entertaining then do sometimes seem a little out there though that's what makes these movies so entertaining in the first place. The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.  I do advise new comers to try and watch a trailer or clip though as while many especially fans greatly appreciate the movie it might not be for you.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is a unique character and proved it again in this story. It got a little drawn out but kept my attention; but that is Lee Childs, his novels always build the suspense and intrigue. I highly reccommend Wanted Man to anyone who wants a geat read!
B00005JNQS|5.0|Great story about not giving up on your dreams and being yourself and not comforming to what someone else my consider the new normal. Robin Williams is great as Fender. My kids and I love this movie. We laugh everytime we watch it. All the characters are great. Animation is terrific and the ideas put into the animation is wonderful for the imagination.
0316228532|4.0|Over the past few weeks Ms. Rowling has been doing the talk and promotion circuit. The reviews on her newest novel - and only 'adult' release thus far - have been less than generous. And, some have been downright nasty - reflecting (I dare say) some of the human characteristics her story explores.<br />Due to a complete and utter disinterest in anything magical, I failed to read the Harry Potter series. However, I hasten to say I was favourably impressed that she created a world in word that young people actually wanted to read. In particular, Rowling is credited with bringing boys to books; no small feat in the face of competing entertainment devices.<br /><br />The book draws its title from the term used when a seat on a local British \\"council\\" is vacated. In her novel, this vacancy is created by the prosaic death of a profoundly complex man. The reader gets to know this man, Barry Fairbrother, through the ambitions, hearts, imaginations, and memories of characters created by Rowling from a diverse section of British society. As characters vie to fill this 'vacancy' the veneer of modesty is stripped back to reveal coniving, underhanded and nefarious behaviours of adults and adolescents.<br /><br />We witness a clash of cultural and personal values as a housing estate geographically attached to one county is set to be reassigned to another. The bucolic Pagford features many of the aspects one expects to find in a sleepy English village: church steeples, central square, small specialised shops as well as deviants, drunks, racists and smug, self satisfied classists. The horrific \\"Fields\\" housing estate comprises sexual abuse victims and abusers, fatherless children, whoring, addicted mothers, as well as an element of real compassion and visceral dedication to family.<br /><br />There are many relationships in the book: bored, married women and boring married men; clinging single women and spineless uncommitted partners; adolescents who goad and bully, adoloscents wholove and hate, and adolscents who seek attention and genuity from parents who hide the truth. The novel explores the now global phenomenon: grand parents who care and foster when parents abandon.<br /><br />Finally, the story explores the real albeit brutal, life on the Estate. Life there is contrasted to the comfortable facade of Pagford in words that may shock - but which are the exact currency of communication today. An imagined stench rises like steam from the fifth of the Fields while a slower moving toxic fume floats more genteelly over Pagford.<br /><br />The book contains scenes of intense emotional torture and self inflicted wounding, and scenes of immense compassion. There are innumerable scenes of human failure and human heart break. It is a compelling read, by not always an easy one.<br /><br />The story begins and ends in death. A boy with promise, a boy with none.<br /><br />Rowling has proven herself here as a writer for the adult market. A great tale, fresh insight into life today, and an opportunity for us to think and consider.

0062127241|5.0|If you read this memoir for all the events in Pete Townshend's life, you're missing the main thrust, the larger picture, of this book.  This is not about all the many (albeit interesting  and fascinating) stories Townshend lays out, but more about how these events affected him. Townshend has opened up his life-both personally and professionally-in able to (hopefully) tell us and himself just who he is.  \\"...I both want this book to entertain, but also to convince\\".  Pete Townshend.<br /><br />This clearly written, straightforward book (separated into three \\"Acts\\") lays out, in a matter of fact style, everything that has made (and is still making) Townshend who he is.  He is at times brutally honest in his writing.  At other times he seems to be more removed from the events he talks about.  You may at times agree or disagree with what he writes.  But taken together, this is one of the most honest attempts to paint a picture of one's self and the things that he's experienced, that any artist has written.  The book is always fascinating, and sometimes riveting to read, but it's not openly self-analytical.  From his beginnings through his life in music-everything is laid out as Townshend remembers it.  Of course  The Who and that part of his life are interesting and informative, and are naturally a large part of the book, and go some way in helping to explain who Townshend is.  But all aspects of his life he writes about help fill in the gaps for a better picture of Townshend.<br /><br />\\"This is as much a note to myself as one to you. It's all the same thing.  If in doubt, just play\\".  Pete Townshend.<br /><br />The sixteen pages of photographs (in two sections) is helpful and adds depth and some interest to the story.  No picking out highlights (or low lights), no overview of the many things Townshend writes about is needed-some will be familiar to you-others not.  But taken together, this is a real attempt by Townshend to look beneath the surface, to put into some kind of perspective, all the events (both important and seemingly unimportant) that have shaped and molded him into the person he is today.  \\"Away from therapy I still used the technique I'd learned, writing more diary entries than usual, as well as bitterly honest letters I never sent\\".  \\"...this time I thought seriously about writing my autobiography\\".  Pete Towhshend.<br /><br />To sum up-this book is the only way we're going to know this much about Pete Townshend.  Any closer and we'd be him.<br /><br />\\"Enjoy life. And be careful what you pray for-remember, you will get it all\\".  From a letter Townshend wrote many years ago to his \\"eight-year-old self\\", the \\"kid brother inside me\\", saying, \\"The letter I wrote to my eight-year-old self is still one of the most important affirmations in my life\\".nd of perspective, all the events (both important and seemingly unimportant) that have shaped and molded him into the person he is today.  \\"Away from therapy I still used the technique I'd learned, writing more diary entries than usual, as well as bitterly honest letters I never sent\\".  \\"...this time I thought seriously about writing my autobiography\\".

This particular book, with its study of a Northern Canadian Indian tribe, its trials & concerns, its lifestyle & struggles against the rich & powerful, add beautifully to the adventure of solving the horrible crime that is at hand for Brennan. It shows Reichs well-known ability not to make this just a medical/Anthropological thriller, but her true concern for current events & struggles going on with real people!

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle thinking it sounded like an interesting read. That is an understatement. I devoured the book in about a week. Mr. Duhigg doesn't just offer a book that says \\"do this, do that and your life will be excellent!\\" He does not load you with empty promises and then leave you to figure it all out. He provides scientific explanations and studies and then \\"translates\\" what it all means so that the average person could apply it to their own life. The initial section describes the functions of the brain and what is behind why we do what we do-even if we never remember doing it. He focuses on how individuals use habits and how someone could develop a new habit or change a bad one. He explains the ways that companies (retail to hospitals to Starbucks) use habits to persuade shoppers and shape their employees. There is also a section on how habits help shape societies as a whole and can turn their direction. At the very end, if you are still left wondering 'How can I USE any of this?' there is an Appendix that breaks down some of the steps to creating or changing personal habits. I loved the book so much I bought two more copies, in hardback, for family members.

0143117130|4.0|Helen Fielding is an excellent comedic in this Bridget series. The first portion of the book Bridget had me laughing right at the start. Her New Years resolution was long with will not and wills. But there were some resolutions that I could even relate to.<br /><br />The English slang words were both cute and funny. There's also Jone's abbreviations (i.e.: v. and v.g. = very and very good) that even I found myself using for a little while.<br /><br />Her love triangle with her boss Daniel Cleaver (all bad boy) and lawyer Mark Darcy (good guy) is really romantic. Daniel is the guy that she resolved not to obsess about as he is an alcoholic, workaholic, commitment phobic, chauvinist and emotional f-wits (all things she also resolved not to fall for). Mark is the good guy who finishes last. Yes, he was already taken (the woman was a crazy needy woman who didn't love him). Yes, he couldn't make decision or stand up for himself (the clothes he wore were his mother's choices). But after a while I could tell that she should pick the lawyer over the cheat.<br /><br />This is a good Brit-lit series (2 1/2 books). Bridget is a little over the top at times, but that's what makes the character so funny.

He played the perfect womanizer.<br /><br />Colin Firth played Mark Darcy. He was really good at portraying the character. He was both macho and nice. And it was cute too, because Bridget's character is supposed to have this crush on the actor Colin Firth due to the BBC miniseries 'Pride and Prejudice'(1996).<br /><br />The fight between the two guys for Bridget was perfect in the movie.

B009AJDDQU|4.0|Prometheus is part new and part old.<br /><br />Alien was a new idea.  Aliens expanded the idea in a very credible and cool way, adding some nice layers of story.  Alien 3, 4, AVP, made the Alien world huge.<br /><br />The Prometheus idea is new, which is what makes it awesome, but it uses old cinematic ideas, which is not what I feel about Alien or Aliens.  Granted, its probably more and more difficult to come up with something like an Alien/Aliens/Matrix where the movie just feels plain new and fresh and awesome from most every angle, regardless, I have to rate the movie 4 stars rather than 5.  I feel like I've seen some of the movie before, and not just in the Aliens franchise.<br /><br />Stil, Prometheus is a firm step up in quality from Alien 3 and beyond, placing it squarely behind Alien/Aliens, decidedly into the must see category.  A sequel is assured.. they have the story to make the sequel as good as Alien/Aliens.  Now if they can only get James Cameron to direct...

B004LWZWGK|3.0|On my first day of third grade, my teacher delighted every school boy or girl present, including myself, when she said, \\"Class, as of today, everyone has an A.\\" The smiles were huge, but they were soon followed by grumbles. Could it really be so easy? Of course, it wasn't. My teacher explained, \\"Everyone has an A, but from this point on, each grade beneath it takes away from that A.\\" In short, it was a trick--a way to make students prone to thinking they were starting with nothing and working towards greatness as thinking they were starting with greatness and they only had to sustain. In regards to Christopher Nolan, who is one of the greatest living writers period, this scale is no trick. It's a requirement. You must judge Nolan on a scale of greatness, then determine if he sustained it, and while Christopher Nolan has never made a bad movie, he got dangerously close in The Dark Knight Rises (DRK).<br /><br />So, what's wrong with the DKR? How can the third movie of a successful franchise, using the same creators, the same cast, and one of the biggest budgets in movie history fall short? It's the same thing that sinks most movies in its position, the writing wasn't there. Post DK, Christopher Nolan has been extremely busy, including making his dream movie, the mega-successful and mentally-titillating Inception, and he (I'm including his brother in \\"he\\") never got the opportunity to finish the DKR script, which is the script's largest problem--it's not bad, it's incomplete. Nolan is one of the most technically sound writers in Hollywood. This guy never makes a mistake, his every line of dialogue pushes the story forward, he follows storytelling theory to its core, focusing on building familiar settings, strong antagonists, helpers who have clearly defined roles, breaks his scripts into three clear acts, and always pays off in the \\"final battle,\\" and upon its conclusion, the protagonist always become \\"the master of two worlds.\\" These aren't talents Christopher Nolanwas blessed with, they're signs of a precise, obsessive, and brilliant writer, someone who's entire existence is devoted to the page, and to top it off, Nolan frequently flaunts his flare for non-chronological timelines, which are nearly Shakespearian in their careful balance and meticulous execution.<br /><br />All of this is missing from the DKR.<br /><br />Is it the result of a bad script? Or was the story anemic?<br /><br />First off, there were signs that Nolan's Batman franchise was fatigued. (Many noticed that DK was a rewritten version of The Prestige). In DKR, these signs became reality.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine, is Bruce's wiseman and trusted source of perspective. In BB, after Bruce returns from saving Rachel from Scarecrow, Alfred shares needed insight to Bruce by saying, \\"You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.\\" This comment returns the story to one of identity before Ra's re-enters the plot (like one minute later). Alfred's informing the audience that only by being Bruce Wayne and Batman in unity will Bruce defeat Ra's al Ghul, or else Bruce is \\"just a vigilante.\\" It seems heady and unnecessary to analyze the film this deeply, but man does it ever pay off, especially during the final battle, when Bruce fights Ra's al Ghul on a train, which Bruce's father built, that's on a collision course with Wayne Tower, a destiny Bruce has long feared, in a fight where Ra's al Ghul tells Bruce, \\"You were just an ordinary man in a cape, that's why you can't fight injustice.\\" In the end, Bruce does become more than himself or Batman, finding a superior identity, he defeats Ra's and preserves the Wayne legacy despite his father's home and train being destroyed. In DK, Alfred offers needed insight into Joker when he shares the story of a crazed man stealing jewels in the jungle, which informs Bruce that Joker is not a \\"common criminal,\\" and it informs the audience that Bruce is underestimating the Joker. By doing so, Alfred is also sharing with us how, should Bruce choose to gain this sacred knowledge, he will eventually triumph.<br /><br />In DKR, Alfred does not deliver a story of immense insight, he's asked to simply set up the ending, where we see Bruce Wayne living a new life away from Gotham. To complicate things, this scene also sets the tone of what is DKR's worst flaw, indulgence. For a writer who's known for his restraint, Nolan packed DKR with little needed side-scenes. Here you have Michael Caine, one of the greatest actors of all time at his rare specialty, the actor who makes boring but necessary dialogue interesting, an under-appreciated day laborer working for bosses making huge bonuses off his sweat, and all you really have to do, in Nolan's position, is not over think it. Do what you did in BB and DK and let Michael Caine tell the story, let the camera watch him stoically, and do absolutely nothing else. However, Nolan chose to cutaway to a depiction of Alfred's story, which was heart-wrenching as it gave away the final twist. It was an unfortunate risk that didn't pay off for Nolan, and that happens, but it's an indulgence because (I feel) it's likely the audience would've remembered Alfred's story without the cutaway. It's doubtful that Michael Caine is anyone's favorite actor, yet we all know one thing: When Caine speaks, we listen.<br /><br />Before I stray too far from my premise, I will concede that my argument thus far begs the question. If Alfred always has insight to offer on the antagonist, why does Alfred have none to offer in DKR? Alfred has none because, technically, DKR has no antagonist. In any good story, the antagonist is the character who represents all the protagonist's fear, guilt and denial. (This is why the Joker is Batman's ultimate villain). Or to be brief, it's the character who wants to prevent the protagonist from reaching his/her goal. So who is the antagonist of DRK? Is it Bane? No, it's not. We find out at the end that Bane isn't doing what he's doing to stop Batman from fixing Gotham. He's doing it because of an immense, and subsequently pathetic, love for Talia al Ghul. But, wait... It's obviously Talia al Ghul, isn't it? Wrong again! Talia claims that her motivation is finishing her father's work. If her father's dream was to blow up Miami Beach, she'd have done so. It's a powerful motivator for her character, but it also means she's not Batman's nemesis.<br /><br />So who is the antagonist of DKR? It's Ra's al Ghul.<br /><br />It turns out that DKR is a bigger version of BB, which might've worked, except it ends up being hollow, we don't get a pay off, because Ra's al Ghul was defeated two movies ago. We know he cannot beat Bruce, and we know Bruce has already gained all the \\"sacred knowledge\\" necessary to defeat Ra's, and so Bruce is already the \\"master of two worlds\\" in this challenge. He's just, you know, older. Sometimes Alfred pointed out at nauseum.<br /><br />At the end of BB, Bruce tries to tell Rachel that Batman is just a symbol, and Rachel tells him it's untrue, that Batman is no longer a mask. In DK, she writes Bruce a letter telling him that he'll always need Batman. Both of these stories confirm Alfred's insight in BB, which was that Bruce had to become something more than Batman or Bruce. By having Bruce face Ra's al Ghul again in DKR, we draw Bruce into another identity crisis, but this one is harder to maneuver without Rachel. There're few characters who know both Bruce and Batman equally, so it falls on Alfred to do it, and he proceeds to abandon Bruce, essentially equating Bruce's drive to save Gotham to that of a deranged and suicidal alcoholic.<br /><br />Using Talia and Bane worsens the identity crisis plotline. As the saying goes, the protagonist is only as strong as the antagonist, and as Christopher Nolan knows, and temporarily forgot for DKR, all antagonists should be fanatical in their pursuits. Consider BB, where Ra's knows no limit in his view of justice, and then DK, where Joker so radically subscribes to anarchy that he mocks \\"cause and effect\\" theory by changing the origin story of his scars on his every recollection. In essence, despite being the most radical of the three movies, DKR is not a story of fanaticism, it's a story of love---it's the tragedy of Bane's love for Talia, and Talia's love for her father, and since neither pursuit represents fanaticism, we know our antagonists don't actually believe in their actions, which means they lack identity, as well.<br /><br />For plenty of DKR, we listen to unintelligible speeches about how Gotham's being \\"returned to the people,\\" which feels engineered since none of Gotham's citizens are actual planners or participators in this revolution, except for maybe a few hundred people in the sewers and 1,000 released prisoners. (BTW, in DK, didn't Nolan show us that even prisoners have morality? Why are they so willing, in DKR, to supplant an entire society? If it's true that these prisoners are locked up by Dent's law, then they're locals and they have families who're going to die.) Because of this, when Batman arrives at the final battle, beating down Bane, shouting, \\"Where is the trigger? I know you wouldn't give it to an average citizen\\" it feels anti-climatic. As an audience, we've known this data for hours, but Batman's only now catching up? Where is the journey we take with one of the world's greatest detectives? (Answer: We can't take it! He was stuck in a hole on the other side of the world...FOREVER.) Sure, Bane's claims of giving the button to an \\"average citizen\\" is, I suppose, a nice play on what the Joker did in DK, but I don't see why it was necessary in DKR.<br /><br />As if the final battle in DKR wasn't flawed enough, it's felt like Batman says more than he does in all of BB and DK combined. We're talking about a dark, mysterious figure so powerful that his nemesis's often speak for him. In DK, when hung off the edge of the building, mobster Salvatore Maroni surmises the situation for Batman, saying, \\"From one professional to another, if you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot. From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me,\\" which of course leaves Batman to say in his cold as ice manner, \\"I'm counting on it.\\" When confronting Bane in DKR, on the steps of Gotham's City Hall (I believe), in response to Bane's taunt, Batman blandly says, \\"I came here to stop you.\\" (If Nolan had been on his game, Bane would have said, \\"Have you come here to stop me, Batman?\\" and Batman would've said, \\"[enter comeback here].\\")<br /><br />All these elements in DKR are tied together by the classic movie convention, a time bomb, which is, in actuality, a writers way of saying, \\"Since the entire universe is going to end simultaneously, all these plotlines must be related, right?\\" But, in this is where Nolan becomes the victim. How could he have anticipated the Japanese tsunami and pursuant reactor crisis? When he wrote the script, he had to feel comfortable with it, yet when his audience sees it now, things like \\"blast radius,\\" \\"radioactive decay,\\" and, \\"weaponized,\\" are not terms we let graze past us. We know nuclear reactors can't detonate like a bomb, they need to be designed specifically as a bomb, and that weapons grade materials aren't safe for day-in and day-out power generation. Had Nolan known that we'd know this, Lucius Fox would've given a sentence or two to dismiss it, or invented a reason why fusion generation can explode catastrophically. Regardless, when we learn that it takes months for the radioactive decay to reach a critical point of instability (which I think is backwards, but I'm not a nuclear physicist, so what do I know), it feels eerily similiar to Japan's reactor meltdowns, which took weeks to be stabilized, yet because of the Japan crisis, we know it's ridiculous to even contemplate that the process, the decay or the meltdown, can be bolted down to an exact second five months in advance.<br /><br />The science ofthe bomb plot bit Nolan in the butt, but where Nolan owns fault is in his story application of the bomb, which is problematic. Supposedly, Batman flies out over the bay, sacrificing his life to save the city (something which would resolve his identity crisis and confirm that, yes, the merged identities in BB did happen). Though, because of the DKR's beginning, I was expecting Alfred to go on vacation, stop for a drink, and look for Bruce, so the fake funeral beforehand was tedious, cause I was 2hrs 30mins in and I still hadn't gotten a pay-off, I was still waiting for Bruce to become the master of two worlds for DKR, and I knew that was impossible if he was dead. Of course, DKR does cut to Alfred drinking and looking up at Bruce with Selina Kyle, which offers its own closure. If Bruce needed Batman to come to terms with his parent's death, perhaps ridding himself of Batman, and using the \\"Clean Slate\\" program to give both him and his new love a chance at happiness, represents becoming a master of two worlds, but that is also problematic since, if it's true, then Bruce was his own antagonist in DKR, and if he was his own antagonist, why bring back Ra's al Ghul? And if Bruce was his own antagonist, and Ra's was just a symbol of that antagonist, and if Bruce didn't actually die on his helicopter flight, and he always knew he wouldn't die on it, then what exactly was the final battle, who won it, and does it even matter?<br /><br />In the end, Nolan created a meaning paradox. Everything about this movie begs the question.<br /><br />These contradictions in DKR null and void more than just the antagonist question. Most of the plot is built on the political and judicial reforms enacted after Harvey Dent's death, and it ties the deception involved in Harvey Dent's death to the failure of these protocols (crime goes down, but it's only because they've pushed all the poor and downtrodden into the sewers). Lots of time is spent in DKR talking about the \\"truth\\" and bringing it forward. Indeed, Bane does read Commissioner Gordon's unread speech, spilling the truth about Harvey's demise, which I guess every Gothamite wholly believed since no one questioned it. In fact, after Bane said this great secret, it was barely mentioned again. At the conclusion, Harvey Dent is outed as Two Face, and Batman is recognized as the true white knight of Gotham, but this in itself represents another contradiction. When Bruce decided to fake his death, or Batman's, he may have metaphorically killed Batman, but in reality, Batman becomes just another Harvey Dent, another fallen martyr who didn't actually die for Gotham.<br /><br />Wasn't that what caused the conditions for the third movie?<br /><br />In the end, I guess, Bruce's identity crisis between himself and Batman gets resolved when defeating his mentor, a man talented at multiple identities and deception in Ra's al Ghul (BB), goes onto to create a lie about Harvey Dent's death to stimulate collective action in Gotham and squash the Joker's plans for anarchy (DK), yet in DKR, we find out that Bruce didn't really resolve any identity crisis in BB, he never really needed to become Batman, and while it was a mistake to tell the lie he told in DK, it's okay to tell it again so that he can move to Europe and hook-up constantly with Selina Kyle.<br /><br />(Not that I blame him!!!!)<br /><br />So what could've given DKR a puncher's chance?<br /><br />Two movies.<br /><br />What Christopher Nolan tried to create, he is more than capable of doing, but he needed an extra ninety minutes to balance it in the special way only he can. Being such a traditionalist, Nolan might despise the idea that Harry Potter, Twilight, and the Hobbit are being turned into multiple movies from singular sources, but DKR would have done well to have a Part I and Part II, six months apart from each other, a la Harry Potter. The first movie ends when Batman gets his back broken. The second opens on a montage of him healing. It savesus the twenty minutes where he lays around immobilized on a mat, and it provides time to fill story holes and develop a proper antagonist. Ra's al Ghul can easily be a big part of this story, but he needs to be an inspiration to Talia, a catalyst for bigger things.<br /><br />All that said, you can fall too far down the rabbit hole in regards to Christopher Nolan. He still gets top notch performances out of Christian Bale, Jason Gordon-Levitt, and a bit to my surprise, Anne Hathaway, who's an understated master at facial expressions (who knew?). The script, while flawed philosophically, has all the witty banter one expects from the likes of Nolan, including a few good jokes between Alfred and Bruce, a few good love-jabs between Selina and Bruce, and I think even Bane managed to turn a phrase or two. To paraphrase what I said earlier, it's not that this movie is bad, it's not that the script is bad, it's just not finished. Nolan could've done better with these pieces, and I think in time, he will say, \\"If I could do it again, I'd have given myself another 2 years to finish Batman.\\" Who knows if that extra time could've have taken DKR to the level of BB and DK, aren't all the third movies in trilogies awful? In the end, the standards and protocols, \\"the way things have always been done,\\" states that no series is complete unless it's a trilogy at the minimum, but perhaps in Nolan's Bat trilogy, two movies were more than enough.

B008NEVP1S|5.0|The first time I listened to Aimee Mann's CD Charmer, I just listened to the music and did not pay as much attention to the lyrics. They are provided in the CD jacket. Then I began to pick up bits and pieces of the stories she was weaving. How we sometimes live lives of deception and the different masks that are worn to protect oneself or that others wear. The next time I read along with the lyrics in my hand and realized how she has remained a remarkable storyteller. These songs are truly short stories. While the lyrics at first glance may seem simplistic, they are in fact deep and with many layers. The playing and production is excellent and everything comes together in a remarkable recording with memorable images and melodies. Aimee charms but she also opens up new perspectives. She is an amazing musician, writer, and truly an artist.

B00338QENI|3.0|In my science classes, I never heard a peep about Henrietta Lacks or the fascinating story of how this 31 year old black woman and mother from Baltimore had her cancer cells harvested at Johns Hopkins.  Her cells would continue to live long beyond her life, cut short by cervical cancer, contributing to numerous cures for polio and other diseases, even going on trips on the Space Shuttle.  Her family--kids too young to remember their mother--were informed years later. The story is fascinating as it is a cautionary tale of how the American medical research establishment can behave in very unethical ways.  It is also a very sad story--as the Lackses are very poor and pretty much in ignorance of the importance of their mother's contributions to medical science.  The book is a little uneven in spots.  There is a lot about poor decisions that the family makes that contribute nothing to the story, although you feel sad just the same.  Some of the medical research could have been better explained, instead of reading like a footnote. There are a great number of books out about Henrietta Lacks' incredible cells. If you like a medical mystery and a good story about an unsung heroine, this book is worth checking out.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed the series although, I thought it could have been done in one or two books rather than three.  I liked all the characters and thought they were well developed.  The hot scenes were hot to be sure, however, there were almost too many and became redundant.  For a first attempt at writing, I thought it was well done.  I enjoyed the Epilogue and the follow up from the Grey perspective.  I would love to see the author pen follow up stories for Kate and Mia.

B008D36INE|2.0|You would think a story about sexual repression and forbidden love would be juicy but this film is lacking in so many ways. Simply put the characterization is flat and I could not bring myself to care about such selfish insipid people and their struggles. There is no great seduction, it is laughably anticlimactic. Hester is not someone you sympathize with, you want to smack her. Freddie is just as bad, and both are immature prats. The pacing is off as well, the payout of their sexual tension comes too soon, and the use of flashbacks is confusing and jars an already awkward movie.<br /><br />Watch if if you want to see Tom and Rachael naked. Then turn if off and spare yourself the remaining 2 hours.<br /><br />I would have given it 1 star, but a naked Tom Hiddleston is worth at least one.

0316228532|4.0|A Casual Vacancy, the long awaited adult novel from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is a different kind of book. Not only is it as far as possibly different than the HP series, it is also a book that is different from all adult novels. If you are looking for something similar to Harry Potter or a good wholesome read like the Potterdom was...put this book down and head to the teen section. This is a black comedy novel FOR ADULTS and even made me as an adult a little nervous at times. Not to put too big of a spoiler on things but there is rape, sex, scandal, child abuse, drug abuse, and lots of British jargon to hold it all together (think tracksuits) in this small town.<br /><br />The storyline is basically what all the petty little people in small town Pagford decide to do and who they decide to step on to get to their goals when councilman Barry Fairbrother dies, leaving an open council spot...a casual vacancy. His death impacts the fate of the addiction clinic and its inhabitants as well as those who loved and hated him.<br /><br />A Casual Vacancy is small town soap-opera Peyton Place meets ruthless people and motives of Trainspotting. That being said, once I committed myself to the work and got over J.K. Rowling being a dirty writer, I could not put the work down. And once I did finish the book, I was left with an overwhelming satisfaction. I was not satisfied that everything had been wrapped up in a neat little bow, nor that there was a happy ending (there's not) but rather satisfied because the work was real. It's as real as fiction gets folks. Furthermore, I realized that I loved every single one of the characters of Vacancy...even the baddies! Rowling has a way of being real with the reader and letting us know the characters as fully as one can and that makes the book worth a read in itself. If it comes to pass, I will definitely read other adult novels that J.K. Rowling writes.<br /><br />Even though its not what Potterfans might be craving, it might whettheir appetite for something meatier while they wait for the main course.

1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens writes from his heart about his diagnosis and treatment for esophageal cancer.  He makes a clear distinction between the meaningful and the banal with which all people bearing a terminal disease encounter. His depth of humanity, love of life, and his utter devotion to his wife and family are both exhilarating and heart rending.  He has been praised for staring into eternity without \\"giving in\\" to the solace of religion, despite the well-meaning counsel of many. The reader is left to ponder Pilate's last question to Christ as they judge for themselves whether Mr. Hitchens defiance was that of a hero or a fool.  This is not a book for the faint of heart.

This book is an easy to read masterpiece of spiritual literature for helping people awaken to a higher purpose in life. I personally liked 'A New Earth' more than 'The Power of Now', but they're both awesome books and required reading. However 'A New Earth' is more colorful and enriching. I dare say that if all of humanity embraced Eckhart Tolle's teachings, there would be less pain, war and suffering in this world.

0374214913|5.0|There's so much in this slim volume that I'm not sure where to start.  Here's the TLDR version:  it's an utter delight, and you should buy it immediately.<br /><br />Our hero is a graphic designer with some meager programming skills who is left jobless by the recession.  He finds new work as a bookstore clerk, and soon discovers that the store is much more than it seems.  His quest to uncover its secrets leads only to mysteries, eventually sending him not only across the country but (figuratively) back in time to when the technology to make books widely accessible first became available.<br /><br />The \\"I love the smell of glue\\" crowd is represented, as are the \\"print is already dead\\" folks.  Neither are wrong, because the book as object *and* the book as text are important in different ways.  The vast power of the Internet is harnessed, often to great effect, but human handcraft is also vital.<br /><br />That would be plenty, but there's so much more.  For instance, consider the idea -- so casually tossed off -- that the world is simply filled with secret societies, the only hitch being that most of them don't realize that they're secret.  Or ponder how the standard adventuring party from role-playing games, when the roles are translated into modern terms, actually is a fine combination of human resources for accomplishing a goal quickly.  Or think on how movable-type presses were, in their day, the equivalent of a young Internet -- a new technology with limitless and thrilling potential to open vistas theretofore undreamed-of.<br /><br />It's missing a few things, most notably combat and sex.  I didn't miss them.  I didn't even really notice their lack until I sat down to write this review.  There's no need for faux excitement when there's so much genuine excitement.  The book is so full of *story,* not to mention ideas, that the pages very nearly turn of their own accord.<br /><br />Buy it.  Read it.  Rethink parts of your world.

0316228532|1.0|I feel compelled to review this book.  This book is the most depressing book I've ever read.  I finished it hoping to find something redeeming at the end but was disappointed.

0316228532|5.0|Having read some of the more negative views, I have to say this:  Would you have ranked \\"1984\\", \\"The Bluest Eye\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", or \\"Great Expectations\\" so badly? Guess what, some of the best stories aren't fun-filled light reading!  Some of the best works are disturbing, even sad. So, if your view of literature is that a book can only be worthwhile if you can breeze through it having a fun adventure, then don't bother with this book.  This is something else entirely.<br /><br />That said, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is a disturbing character study.  It is written in third-person omniscient point of view. It does require some effort to handle a story with some 18 or so viewpoint characters, so this book will be at too high a reading level for some. I normally don't like the omniscient POV, but this story had to be told that way and Rowling handles it with expertise.<br /><br />So, what is this book about?  It is about pain and cruelty and why people become cruel.  There are no traditional protagonists or antagonists, just people going through life.  Rowling explores the various ways that people become cruel, angry, or jaded with each main character showing a different form of cruelty and a different reason for it.  And, this book is about the people that get hurt by other people's pain and anger.<br /><br />This isn't an easy book to read, probably the reason so many have reviewed it negatively.  But, this is a brilliantly written book, just not for everyone.<br /><br />This novel is written with a seldom-seen narrative structure.  In this structure the story begins with a simple, perhaps commonplace, connection between a group of people (in this case, someone dies, which has some effect on each of these characters).  The narrative then explores how each character's life led him or her to be present for that connecting event and then the character moves on past the single event.  As this structure is used for a character study, the connecting event may not even be particularly important.  Instead, we see a collection of interconnected characters as the main thrust of the novel, rather than a single story unfolding.  In this case, we follow how the death at the beginning of the novel affects approximately 18 characters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those who want to read something thought-provoking and actually about the real world.  But, if you want some light reading that you don't have to think about, then stay away from \\"The Casual Vacancy\\".<br /><br />To those who reviewed it negatively because it wasn't like Harry Potter, I can only ask whether they were paying attention.  Rowling explored many of these themes, hidden behind the window dressing of fantasy, in those books. That is why Harry Potter was not just another of the countless stories about magical children.  She continues this exploration in \\"The Casual Vacancy\\", but without the magic and without the restrictions of children's literature.<br /><br />Edited to add:  I realize that Rowling has described this as a dark comedy.  I don't know why she has said that.  Perhaps she had intended this to be a comedy, and there are some satirical scenes, but it grew into something else as she developed and revised it.  Whatever the case, I saw very little that was humorous in this book.  I did greatly appreciate the book, but I don't know why she would claim it was a comedy, dark or otherwise.particularly important.

There are lots of quieter parts, of course along with the heavier parts and it makes better use of melody on this album.  Blood is probably the best song on the album.

1401937268|4.0|I have recently received the Angel Tarot Cards by Doreen Virtue and Radleigh Valentine and I have to say that the deck is both lovely and user friendly.<br /><br />This is not my first Doreen Virtue deck, of course.  I have several (6) of Doreen's oracle decks and cherish each and every one.  But I wasn't sure that I would feel the same way about the Angel Tarot.<br /><br />Initially advertised as a 'safe' tarot deck, many traditional tarot readers had reservations that the Angel Tarot would be watered down or soft.  And this was my first (sight unseen) opinion of the deck as well.  To be honest, I might not have bought this deck if it wasn't required material for the Doreen Virtue Angel Card Certification course which I am currently taking.<br /><br />When I received the cards, however, I was happy to see that the deck was of similar quality to Virtue's other decks.  The cards are cut from heavy card stock, come in a sturdy box (like all of Doreen Virtue's cards) and include a detailed and comprehensive 133 page booklet.  Artistically, many of the cards are breathtaking.<br /><br />While the deck is positive and affirming, the creators have followed the traditional meanings of the cards as presented in the Rider-Waite-Smith (RWS) very closely which I find appealing.  Also, even though the suits bear non traditional names (Swords, Wands, Cups and Pentacles are now Air, Fire, Water and Earth) but the elemental associations and spirit of the suits remains.<br /><br />The Water cards are true water cards in beautiful blues and greens filled with images of mermaids, dolphins and whales.  And these images serve to connect us with the elemental meaning of the suit of cups quite well.  There is not a lot of symbolism on which build a reading.  It is, however, easy to 'read in' emotion, the unconscious, psychic abilities and dreams with such images and the printed interpretations at the bottom of the card are well alligned with the standard RWS meanings.  Some of these images in particular unfortunately are smaller in scale then I would have liked.<br /><br />The Earth cards feature intricate forests and lovely woodland fairies capturing the essence of earth without losing sight of its inherent magic.  The Page of Earth pictured above is perfect example of this and I love the energy of this suit.  Again, the symbolism is primarily elemental but well presented.<br /><br />In the Angel Tarot Fire cards we find ourselves face to face with dragons.  These cards blaze with energy and light and I feel that the elemental approach to the suits is especially powerful in this suit.  My astrological card, The Queen of Fire is beautiful, dynamic and powerful.  I love that it is 'my' card!  For me the image of fire evokes a strong association with the passion and creativity of the suit.<br /><br />It is perhaps the suit of Air which has been most transformed, however.  The substitution of unicorns for swords seemed out of place to me initially and I did not expect to like it.  But after seeing the deck up close I have to say that it was a wonderful choice.<br /><br />The image of the unicorn's horn works surprisingly well visually in compositions not unlike the originals without the implied association of violence or pain.  The Two of Air at right is an excellent example of this and I think that the crossed horns of the unicorns are a fine replacement for the crossed swords of the RWS.<br /><br />Changes have been made in the major arcana cards as well.  Each major includes one of the Archangels and several of the cards have been renamed. The Fool is now the Dreamer.  The Heirophant is Unity. There is no Hanged Man, no Death card, no Temperance, Devil, Tower or Judgement.<br /><br />Some of these changes work better for me on a personal level than others.  Overall however I would say that some interpretations work quite well (death-release, devil-ego, temperance-balance) improved upon. while others are somewhat out of step with my personal tarot association.  I do love seeing the archangels portrayed in every major, though I would have perhaps made different selections in some instances (such as keeping Gabriel in the Judgement / Renewal card)<br /><br />All in all, I would consider this deck a good choice for any traditional RWS reader who is looking for a somewhat gentler deck, with a strong elemental energy, as well as a new reader interested in finding written interpretations on the card.  While it may be less suitable for someone interested in the deep symbology of tarot, it is very appropriate for readers looking for an artistically pleasing deck with a strong emphasis on elemental and angelic energies.<br /><br />Major Arcana Changes RWS-->Angel Tarot:<br /><br />0.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The first 1/3rd, you think you know where it is going but surprise you do not. I took a chance on this book not knowing the author, but was pleasently surprised!
B0098VXE50|2.0|This movie wasn't very good because it tried too hard to follow the Disney version while crafting this weird narrative that was never explained. It was confusing and it really dragged during the middle and end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the game I played as a kid at the arcade.  totally worth it since its free. blab blab
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Handy to have on the Kindle.  Not fancy but served my simple needs well.  Easy to see keys and display.  Just gave it four stars because after all it is just a calculator.  But the price is hard to beat.
0525953728|5.0|I didn't think that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.  There were times in the book when I couldn't put it down.  It was informative to the point of making you feel like you were there with them.  Enjoyed it immensely.
B004GYY714|5.0|this app keeps me connected with my kindle fire hd, which currently does not have permission to run flash player.  I use it for npr, I use to go to their site when I missed a broadcast, but they use flash player, but through the extra features I am able to get a list of podcasts for all the shows I love.  If you have a fire hd get this app!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book has been around for a long time and yet I've just found it out, and probably there are more related books out there that are as good as this. It's hard for me to stop reading it. It just happen that I live and grow up in an environment before that don't look deeper into what our minds can do to get the most benefits out of it. And now, I seemed to get noticeable results. Reading of it is just mind awakening, so glad to have found it. I'd like to thank the author who laid it out and most to God Almighty who gave the gift of understanding and the imagination. Thank God for the gift who has created the conscious and subconscious mind.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After spending the past few hours on the couch with my Kindle, I am delighted!  This sequel was amazing!  So much better than the first book!  Whiplash for sure!!<br /><br />Recommend for a great fall read!

0872860175|4.0|Looking for one book, I found this slender volume that I believe I bought at the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco more than 30 years ago. I haven't thought of Ginsberg much--he's not among those poets I'll pick up now and again. However, as nostalgia for the '60s is gathering with the force of a tsunami, I've been seeing more and more photographs of the man in the company of this or that celebrated individual.<br /><br />One could be kind and call him the \\"Beat Zelig,\\" or unkind, and judge him as a committed careerist. I met him a few times in the '80s and early '90s, never liked him or took him seriously. Nevertheless, as I had the book in my hands, I thought I'd read \\"Howl\\" and its companion pieces and see if I came away thinking more highly of the man, his craft and his vision.<br /><br />My short review: \\"Howl\\" is a little overwrought and self regarding. It is a work by a man who knew what he was doing, which while industrious is not particularly poetic. Ginsberg has less Blake or Whitman in him than a hip Robert Frost, by which I means he wants to be both accessible and popular. Read \\"America\\" and you'll understand what I mean by this comparison. It's not a bad poem but utterly contrived.<br /><br />Writing this, I'm happy to concede that the poems \\"A Supermarket in California\\" and \\"In the Baggage Room at Greyhound\\" are excellent, really gems, and deserve to be read today. These poems have something important to say, and say it beautifully, unlike \\"Howl\\" which seems a self-conscious \\"Song of Myself\\" addressed to America's post war, increasingly disaffected, youth. In the end, more a Yawn than a Howl.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book had me reading the whole thing in one setting. I found myself laughing at one point and crying the next. Very well written, story line keeps you engulfed entire time!! LOVED IT!!!!!!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have a biased opinion on Conan Doyles writings so as a fan The Complete Sherlock Holmes is a good read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is a fantastic read. I would recommend it to anyone. I was hooked right away. My only complaint is their is so much sadness in this book. Not many chances for happiness. I wasn't looking for a happy go lucky book with happy endings but maybe something to look forward too.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is my husbands favorite TV show so I was very pleased to be able to get him season 1
B007IXWL2C|3.0|this book is ok. Not as good as the first two. It feels like the author is struggling to wrap everything up and getting lost in her own efforts to do so.  Throwing in bits and pieces of other story lines here and there. Skipping over an episode and then referring to it in the past tense, but in a very dis-connected way.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I learned about Jack Reacher in a review in a magazine.  Started reading I think book nr. 13 or 14.  (61 hours)  Since then I have not looked back.  I started reading them in the right sequence in order to learn the story right.  Wanted man is no exception to the true Jack Reacher story, very true to the character and i loved reading it.<br /><br />Great book with great fun!
B000TGJ8IU|1.0|this was a total rip off. all of the extra merchandise was present in this collector's edition box set, but the product itself was missing!!! in other words, the two dvd's were not anywhere to be found!!! i found out that it would cost about as much to send the set back as what i had paid in the first place, so i decided to just keep it for the movie memorabilia. i blame the seller, Big Apple distributors of New York inc., though, and not amazon.

B000000OPW|4.0|\\"Tinderbox\\" saw Siouxsie and the Banshees hiring yet another guitarist after Robert Smith quit due to a nervous breakdown brought on by trying to be in two bands at once.  John Valentine Carruthers is the latest victim, er, I mean guitar player on this album.  He plays well, even if not at the same level as McGeoch or Smith.  The musical sound this time out is not as lush as the previous efforts.  It's a very dry album... it's the sonic equivalent of a very hot, arid and brain-melting summer's day (which makes the title of the whole thing appropriate).  The music itself is interesting but not that engaging or memorable.  That doesn't mean that this album is bad, far from it, but with the exception of the singles (\\"Candyman,\\" \\"Cities In Dust\\") and \\"Party's Fall\\" (my favorite song on the album, actually) there aren't that many unforgettable melodies.<br /><br />This 1980s Geffen CD version comes with a lyrics booklet and is presented in good sound.  It also comes with five bonus tracks, none of which are vital except for \\"Lullaby.\\"<br /><br />Everyone seems to love this album to death.  I am a little more reserved in my affections for it... I still like it but not as much as the albums that came before it.  You should still get it though especially if you are a Siouxsie and the Banshees fan or even a fan of Eighties alternative rock.
B006H5120E|5.0|Most all know that this is a great movie. But the 3D conversion is fantastic making this great movie even greater. You won't be disappointed with this purchase. The video quality is even better than previously released DVD's/Blu-Ray of this movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|I ordered the digital download of this movie because I want to wait for the complete trilogy to be released before purchasing the actual dvds (I'm expecting that they'll have a special complete set). If you're looking for any special features, however, they aren't included on the digital purchase (I don't know about the actual dvd). The film's great, a more than decent adaptation of the original book.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|this book lives up to what i have come to expect from Ken Follett. a very interesting and informative book!
B00138KJU4|5.0|Love the cd...great music, lyrics and sound....JOurney was back again...loved Steve Perri..but, Steve Augeri does one hell of a job....I LOVE HIS VOICE...  ....PLEASE ONE OF THE STEVE'S GO BACK TO JOURNEY...PLEASE....OKAY, I'M BEGGING....
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love it!  Started reading after watching the series.  I loved the series...the book is even better.  I'm reading book two now and about to start book three!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite movies.  My husband loves it too and we rarely see eye to eye when it comes to movies.  If you haven't seen it, don't miss out!<br /><br />The delivery was prompt and the DVD quality was great.
0792839749|5.0|I'm taking my 5 year old grand-daughter to see the musical \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" and wanted her to know the story before we go...this is one of my favorites from ages ago...definitely a classic that I want in my movie collection!
B008XG1X18|5.0|There is not much to say except I am on this more than any other app... it is truely addicting
0439813786|5.0|This is the most beautiful book! Thick, filled with amazing pencil sketches, with a bright cover. This is a picture book, though it is the size of a very long novel...
0375842209|2.0|I guess I'm one of those people who just doesn't see why this is a 4 or 5 star book. It feels like the author over-reached his abilities. The Death narrator didn't work for me, it felt like Zusak was trying for Vonnegut's ironic narrative without Vonnegut's talent. The title also was problematic as the thievery didn't feel integral to the story.<br /><br />Lastly, the characters were mostly caricatures and felt like stereotypes we've seen before. They lacked backstory or explanations for their behavior that would have made them more credible.<br /><br />This is one of the few books I actually skipped about 40 pages towards the end just to finish.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|This review won't help you buy this movie I'm sure, but I do have to say that between the direction of Spielberg and the score by John Williams how can you not like this movie?<br /><br />One fun fact about this movie though, the theme (Flight to Neverland, highly recommend it) is the base for the theme song in the Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />Rufio! Rufio! Ru! Fi! OOOHHHHHH!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|The book was well written, intriguing, and kept me reading from cover to cover. For others not having read the book, but having heard about it....it is not smut. It does have sexual content, however, there is a very interesting story line.  The characters are well developed and likable. The reader gets involved in their lives easily. I guarantee you will enjoy the book.
B0053O89WY|2.0|I own the DVD sets for all five seasons. This series continues to be somewhat entertaining but the humor continues to more and more for a Junior High level audience. As an \\"older\\" viewer, I emjoy smart television and movies along with those containing a generous amount of slapstick comedy. And as a Computer and A/V tech, I can relate to people just like the characters in the show; but I do not, never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form. Each and every show has at least one and usually more than one reference to bodily functions that I find unfunny and tedious.<br />Wake up Hollywood, teenagers don't have money, we do. I would give this season two out of five stars.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook because it's mobile, and I can get it on any of my devices.  I never have any issues when trying to catch up on news.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed reading the body of the book but, was extremely disappointed with the ending.  As I was reading this book I heard that they want to make it into a movie. I can see with the undramatic ending that they'll be open to sequels.  I will not read the sequel. It's such a letdown when you're reading a good book and it ends like it did.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty shades darker was very   interesting to read. i just loved it and  couldn't stop reading it. can't wait to read the other book.

034580404X|5.0|loved these books, and for the price? who can beat it?! normally one of the books is $16 each! more than worth it to buy online, and the book itself is spellbinding :)
B0088WK27S|5.0|Very good movie! The fact that its based on a true story makes it even more impressive and dramatic. A true story of redemption and making a difference.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|My wife and I mostly enjoyed this movie.  I, personally, could not get over Kristen Stewart's bad acting (IMO).  However, the story line was fine and Charlize Theron's portrayal was good.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I bought this album after I heard A Team on the radio. Ed Sheeran's album is real music. Not the autotune stuff you hear everywhere else. His songs are meaningful and emotional. A great album that I would recommend to anyone.
1450419895|5.0|This is a very well illustrated and highly informative follow up to the equally educational first book by the author [[ASIN:1450400957 Strength Training Anatomy Workout]], who also wrote [[ASIN:0736092269 Strength Training Anatomy-3rd Edition]] and [[ASIN:0736048138 Women's Strength Training Anatomy]]. All three of which are must have books for the physical fitness trainer and the individual concerned with the hows and whys of how your body works during the performance of various exercises.<br /><br />The illustrations are all wonderfully drawn and very detailed while the supporting text if very easy to understand and just as detailed as the illustrations. The accompanying descriptions of each exercise is very well done and the author improves upon that even more by providing variations, advantages and disadvantages, helpful hints, and in some cases even warnings concerning each exercise.<br /><br />This book contains three main parts with numerous sub-headings throughout.<br /><br />Part 1: Advanced Techniques To Help You Keep Progressing<br /><br />Part 2: Exercises For The Main Muscle Groups<br /><br />Part 3: Workout Programs<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in physical fitness whether it is merely an individual wanting to get in shape of the physical fitness professional who wants to better educate himself for his clients.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Martial Artist/Krav Maga Instructor<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Lots of fun, just like the arcade without having to use a pocket full of quarters.  I like being able to challenge myself with the positioning of the coins...
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|What's to say: Kingston quality = just works. Memory expansion not needed for most people. I am moving multiple hits of very large file (aver size 8GB) and the cost to max memory (3GB)was well worth it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book offers an enlightening, new way to look at the data behind success and achievement.  WELL worth the read, and it was a pretty easy read.  I got through it on round-trip two hour flights.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I was doubtful about this movie, but to my surprise was very fun to watch. I would recommend it to anyone
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I really like this movie! I don't know what problem the public seems to have with KS, but in my opinion she is very believable in this movie...Charlize Theron is great and omg Christ Hemsworth is the frosting in the cake ;-) The movie has action and romance. I am glad I decided to ignore other reviews and watch the movie...it was worth it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed reading the hunger games series, but the third one was not nearly as good as the first two.  Still it  did tidy up the whole story. If you've invested in the first two books then its a must read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it. never had a single problem. buttons are easy to push and that my friend is important! go ahead and click that free button!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Playing even in my dreams! I think it's keeping my mind sharp. I need more puzzles asap, please! Such a great way to pass the time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well done. Good, informative and factual.  An easy read that sheds light on the psuedo political nuances, influence and impediments on the military's mission to defend and protect.
B008NW67E0|2.0|I loved Sigh No More and was anxiously awaiting this album.  Unfortunately I was bitterly disapointed.  Like other reviewers I feel the songs started to blend together after awhile and bore me.  None of them seemed to have the energy that you have in a song like Little Lion Man.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This was a great season!! How many characters were done in? This show gets better and better. Acting is great as is writing. Show always has you wondering!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wow. Once I finished I was left mesmerized by this book.  It was a little rushed at the end, and maybe throughout the whole book, but the words and the way Collins wrote was beautiful. Interesting plot twists but *SPOILERS AHEAD* I was not pleased by the ending twist. I didnt like how it was all planned, because in general it didnt make any sense to the story line and the rushed ending with the actually alive district thirteen. But good all in all.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|no glitches at all.  hours of gameplay.  pretty good navigation although I got tired of climbing out the bedroom window to get to the farm.  not for kids tho
B008XG1X18|4.0|It crashes a lot on my Kindle Fire. I can't open the corresponding site to the pins because it crashes every time.<br /><br />It's much better on my phone but I don't want to use up my data plan.
0316228532|1.0|I will be honest with you, if I could have given this a negative star...I would have. I would like to state that I am an avid reader and I do go through at least a book a week, sometimes two. This is the first book in about ten years that I could literally not finish. Everything about it is awful. The only thing I am grateful for; that I have waited to get the book from the library and did not have to pay for it. Do yourself a favor and save your money and time!
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie surprised me and was better than I thought it would be. The action scenes were well made and the plot was descent. Just good enough to make it quite enjoyable.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I downloaded a sample of The CV to my Kindle over the weekend.  After reading it and encountering (just in the sample chapters) not only Ron Weasley's favorite expletive (BH!!), but the s-word, f-word and...perhaps most appalling of all from a female author...the c-word, I can tell you I WON'T be ordering the book.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling had the opportunity with this novel to become as beloved and recognized as a Bronte, or even as Austen, but instead succumbed to some mid-life crisis, whim, or insecurity, and chose to generate an unmemorable tome of vulgarity instead.  (I suppose the pre-book hype, and her over-cleavaged garb should have given me a clue that she, like Daniel Radcliffe with Equus, is trying much, much too hard to leave HP behind.)  I hope that in future \\"adult\\" offerings, she will focus less on the \\"adult\\" and use her ample creativity and intellect to distingush herself in a positive way as a writer in that genre.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The plot still holds up today (even surpasses some, I believe). Similar to The Matrix, it leaves a lot of rooms for What-If's. Great movie to talk about over a glass of wine.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it is well thought out has a story that just keeps you wanting to turn another page and then another page. A good they walk among us style story that has a new slant on witches, Vampires and daemons. nI am looking forwaqrd to reading the next book as well.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It was awesome everyone should play it is greater than all of the games in the world I will give it five stars.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Controls on a touch pad are alright considering many have not perfected it. Would like to see customization. If you have the space, it wouldn't hurt to try it.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Well it was ok movie.  Just didnt really pull me into the movie.  I expected it was very good though Im not sure why they didnt use real little people to do the part seem odd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it!!! Very good book...I finished it in record time!!! I am on my second round reading all three books again.
B001NIA27E|4.0|This is one that has some neat special effects and an OK storyline so you would think you would not care much about it, but AMC has been running it a lot and I always end up watching it. It is entertaining and is kid-friendly for the most part. If you like natural disaster movies, you will not be disappointed.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I stop reading a book even if 'everyone' raves about it...if it doesn't keep my attention.  This one more than kept my attention.  Great read...and it's relevent to 30ish something like me too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very nice plot and well written (Despite of the title, that is unappealing). Never read anything from Hugh Howey, but I'm looking foward reading more books from him.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|got used copy at good price just days after release and received product quickly.  I would use them again next time I'm looking for good deal.

B007SGM084|5.0|Totally loved these books!!  Wish there were more. I couldn't put it down.  Mystery, suspense, erotic love scenes...who could ask for more?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is an incredibly researched work of historical fiction.  It's one of those reads that moves smoothly from the soldiers sacrifices throughout the war to the elgant parties of the country club crowd.  How the relationships of familes are entangled with one another over the decades is fascinating and entertaining.  I am amazed at how Ken Follett can take you effortlessly through the spying and deceit, then pull it all together with how it affected the families in the war torn countries of Europe.  For me, it gave me a better understanding as to why the United States delayed participation in WWII.  I loved this book.
B005SZAQLA|5.0|Watching this during my recovery from my gallbladder surgery made it enjoyable. Great show love all the twists and turns.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is one of the finest games I have ever played. wow I just cant have as much fun ss now. this is probly the finest I just cant have as much fun on anything else.
B004BC7MRM|4.0|\\"Born Free,\\" shows an excessive amount of musical growth from the legendary Kid Rock.  It's funny to think of where Kid Rock came from, the flat top hip-hopin' rocker from Detroit!  Regardless, he is an outstanding musician and very diverse!  I have always enjoyed his albums and his creativity.  This album definitely has more of a Country feel to it and is a great skip free listen.  I recommend this album for anyone who enjoys good music with a little bit of twang.<br /><br />For Those Born Free - or Reborn for Freedom.<br /><br />DZA tha Dangerous!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Great cd ... great historical jam session at Muddy Waters club .. Took a Long time to come out as a recording ... one of the best.
B0054N73EY|5.0|The Chili Peppers excel with the release of \\"I'm With You.\\"  There's always an indescribable magic that these guys are able to create with their music.  Aside from the excellent musical talent of Anthony, Chad and Flee - there is always an evolving growth of musicianship that I find hard not to admire and appreciate.  I was a huge fan of John Fruciante -  but the new guy is good and adds a little something different (as Navarro did with \\"One Hot Minute.\\")  I definitely recommend this album to any Chili Peppers fan and anybody who loves great music!  This review is a little late - but I saw too many negative reviews which is just insane!<br /><br />Rock n' Roll at it's BEST!<br /><br />DZA tha Dangerous!
B0098VXCR0|4.0|I enjoyed this so much I watched it twice within my 48 hour rental. The story was wonderfully told and portrayed by great actors.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had read Bared to You a while ago.  I was super excited to read this sequel.  Reflected in you was just ok until I hit about 50% through the book.  And watch out!  I couldn't put it down.  Is was very powerful and emotional.  I didn't see some things coming.  Eva and Gidion have been through so much.  I cant wait until December to find out what's coming next!  I highly recommend the series!
B0086700CM|4.0|My 8 year old really likes this game. I think it's fun as well. The game will occasionally hesitate though. We enjoy trying to beat each others high scores.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gripping story with a less than perfect heroine.  I loved Camille for all her transgressions.<br />I didn't solve the mystery til near the end, which is what makes for great read.  Not to be missed!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I am an avid fan of Lee Child and have enjoyed all his books. His hero, Jack Reacher, is what I wished I could have become. His freedom of movement,fighting skills, and compassion for the weak and meek are the things fictional heroes are made from. For the most part his books have grabbed me from the opening sentence.<br />Unfortunately, his new non-thrilling thriller is a bore with a convoluted plot line to boot. It rambles on with absolutely no where to go. I know he will do better and I look forward to his next book.<br />  NL
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|ok...I like it but can someone tell me how to get D/D's and what the &quot;XP&quot; coins do if anything?
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Love the catchy tune!  My kids love it, so we can all listen together.  Fun!  Hope her others are as good!
0307744434|5.0|A challenge between magicians gives rise to the most spectacular circus: clad in black and white, featuring wonders beyond imagining, and open only at night. But a place so miraculous, born of such an intense rivalry, may not survive forever. The Night Circus enraptures from the first page; I worried only that it would crumble halfway, but it's a success until the last. Reading the book is much like reading a Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab scent description writ large, so I was tickled to see the company mentioned in the acknowledgements: it's a sensual delight, emphasizing color, scent, and atmosphere so intensely that the circus comes to life, a unique and wondrous place, and the text is stylized in image rather than language (although the language itself is above average, combining readability with gentle poetry). There are three narratives: the core narrative succumbs to some clich&eacute;s of character interaction, but provides a strong skeleton to support the beautiful exterior; the secondary narrative straddles the boundaries of the circus, and is easily the book's most evocative, enchanting, and emotionally fulfilling; the last is in second person, and while it sometimes gets swept away in the book's style it also provides a consummate, satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />So easily could a book like this go wrong: it could be no more than an intriguing but empty aesthetic, the aesthetic could be in competition with the plot, it could all end bitterly and destroy its own dream.... The Night Circus fumbles occasionally, sometimes too in love with its own image and relying on a romance that for the most part failed to stir me, but on the whole Morgenstern knows Les Circues des Rêves as a rêveur does: intensely, in detail, in love, but with a never-ceasing fascination and sense of mystery that means the Circus always has another bit of magic in store. The book succeeds by seeings its vision through to the final letter, vibrant and evocative and emotional when it needs it most, and succeed it does. I highly recommend it.ost, and succeed it does. I highly recommend it.
1423140605|4.0|The third installment of what will be a five book series has finally come out and I could not be happier. Before I get to the nitty gritty I want to start off by going over the cover art and my thoughts on it.<br /><br />The cover art on this book is excellent. I'll make a bold statement and say it's the best cover art of any of the Percy Jackson or Heroes of Olympus books (still not as good as the cover art on the Kane Chronicles). It is however, a bit mis-leading (though certainly makes a great image) as the scene between the two boys depicted is very very short. It takes up a total of 2-3 pages and is not significant in any way really. The red owl overall is a big part of the story/theme and should make more sense once you actually read the novel.<br /><br />This book starts off where the last one ended, with a flying ancient-Greek trireme floating in at the Roman Camp. You'll find out what happens and how it causes some stressful situations later on in the book but I'll leave that knowledge out of this article so I don't ruin it for you. The story continues on the premise of the next great prophecy where seven demigods from both the Roman and Greek camps have to unite to defeat the Giants.<br /><br />Lets move onto character development and new characters in general. Everyone you loved from the first two stories are back in action and ready to go. However, not many new characters were added and if they were they are not an integral part of the story. Also, many of the fan-favorite supporting characters like Ella, Tyson, and Grover just show up for a page or two and are gone for the rest of the book, which is sad but understandable. The main characters also do not develop at all (I suppose one weird one does but it just..eh just read the book) and we lose the complex relationships and feelings we got from the first two books.<br /><br />This story has a TON of action. Almost every scene is action, action, action. I enjoy books that have a lot of action but also has some slower, more meaning-full,  sections that bring the pacing down to an enjoyable stroll in the park. I wouldn't say the pacing in this book is bad but just faster than my taste. The heroes get into one scrap, get out of it, and are right back into another one. They have the stamina of the Gods themselves and thank goodness for ambrosia or we'd have a bunch of puddle stains left.<br /><br />The plot develops nicely as it answers many questions from the previous book and really kick starts the great battle that we all know is coming against the Giants. The first two books were back-drops into how the Romans and Greeks were going to team up. This book moves the plot forward dramatically and is giving us the warm-up act to the big show. The plot twists at the end were truly great and made it one of my favorite cliff-hanger endings ever (laugh out loud).<br /><br />Pros:<br /> Lots of action, our favorite main characters are back, plot moves forward dramatically, writing is superb and flows easily, keeps you entertained for hours on end, and we are one step closer to the finale.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Pacing is a bit too fast, character development was put on hold, favorite supporting characters are MIA, and the always present cliff-hanger ending bursts my bubble.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, despite my few nit-picking complaints, and would recommend this book to just about anyone (unless you don't enjoy awesomeness). It's not my favorite Heroes Of Olympus book, nor is it my favorite Percy Jackson Universe based book, but it's very comparable to the others. I'm going to give this title a 4/5 which is a B+!<br /><br />About me: I'm just a college student who enjoys writing about technology, video games, and fantasy books.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|George R R Martin is continuing his saga<br /><br />of The Game of Thrones in such a masterful way.  The story is always exciting and captures my attention immediately. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

B0034G4OYA|1.0|My personal opinion<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Nothing was good about this movie.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. Adam Sandler's Dracula voice<br />2. Overall plot was thin and required little imagination<br />3. Annoying characters that were LOUD throughout the movie<br />4. Animation wasn't particularly enjoyable to look at<br />5. Movie was comprised mostly of random scenes with boring jokes<br /><br />Yes, I hated this movie.  It was completely boring.  The plot was dumb and uninteresting. The characters were annoying and the voices were grating.  Even for a kid's movie, this one is sub par to many other 3D animated kid's films past and present.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I find watch to be attractive, easy to read, and keeping accurate time. Good value for $69. Would buy again.
B007DA2FHG|2.0|The online service provided by Amazon was excellent. The movie had potential but seemed to drag in the plot.  It seemed more like a made for TV movie, not a true relection of history.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]<br />So many times I wanted to skip to the end of the book to read the outcome because I couldn't stand the suspense. I was completely engrossed in this exciting story. It was definitely hard to put down. I hope the prequel is as good.
B004HUE57S|5.0|I was looking for a mouse that would help reduce some wrist issues that I was having. I read through the prior reviews and was glad to see comments on the 2 sizes of this mouse.  I purchased the \\"Small size\\" VerticalMouse 4 and I love  it.  It has 5 buttons that can be programed the way you want, 2 of those use the thumb.  It's fairly light and easy to use. Very happy with my decision. The product came very quickly and was installed shortly after opening the package.
B004JHYRAE|4.0|Well, for me, the term \\"slut\\" is a negative word. Mixing it with \\"ethical\\" is somewhat extraordinary. In this book, the term \\"slut\\" is being regarded as somewhat, clear and normal, say as \\"ethical\\". The book has made a great job in convincing me though. Open relationships is hard to maintain. I would want it, but am afraid to indulge for I am not too keen with battling the \\"green eyed monster\\". Found this when I saw [[ASIN:B0098MRVUI Aphrodisiac: Cook Your Way to Sexual Bliss]] and eventually went excited to hook up. Maybe this book is not yet meant for me, but this made me realize that if I ever enter myself in an open relationship, it would definitely be possible to work out.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It takes concentration to navigate the style of language and detail to each character written in this novel . You become very familiar with the characters . I would reccomend  this book if you have patience . It is interesting to observe how politics never change !
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series is a great read about a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic future.  The development of the characters and the details of their lives in their Silo is exceptional and keeps you drawn to the books.  The back-story on how the Silo came to be and the conspiracy in place to keep the residents in the dark also makes the story very compelling.  I only hope there is more to the Wool series!

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I tried several other file manager/explorers for the Fire HD and ES File Explorer beats them all, hands down. Easy to use and very intuitive. Can launch apps as well as display information about the app, and has a \\"force stop\\" feature to halt those annoying ones that keep running in the background when you don't need them, this might possibly help conserve battery power?.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King delivered once again.  The characters are believable, the plot interesting, but not what makes the book good.  King puts you in his world, at the end it felt like saying goodbye to an old friend.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|Bought three bulbs just to try the product. One bulb arrived cracked with no apparent damage to either individual packaging or the shipping box. The second bulb started  blinking within minutes of operation; stopped blinking the next day, but died a day or two later. Total operation including the blinking stage was 3-4 hours. Will never buy this brand again.
B008JAFXOQ|2.0|Very boring.  Nobody like Anna Paquin's character can exist in real life; strictly a stereotype.  Paquin is very good, this movie's only redeeming feature.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|It was good, true to the original But just plain too long and dragged at the End<br />I wish they would have finished earlier
B005LAIHY0|3.0|To start off with what I loved about Prometheus, I'll say right now that I loved revisiting that distinct practical future aesthetic. The art direction was amazing and I might go as far as to say that it has the best art direction I've seen in a Sci-fi film since The Fifth Element. I loved what was present in the film and I even loved the viral ad campaign and all the little graphic touches that made Weyland Corp feel as real as Apple Computers.    The film established a great setting and visual tone but I get the sense that the script was a secondary priority. I can see that a lot of other people have gone into great detail about all of the moments where you had supposedly intelligent people do and say incredibly stupid things or arrive at decisions that made no sense. Not to beat a dead horse but I can't stress how greatly these instances effected the movie and diminished my enjoyment of it. It seemed any of these problems could've been avoided by hiring a fresh film school grad to sit in on the writing process and chime in with comments like \\"why are they taking their helmets off?\\" and \\"why is the biologist spooked by the remains of a dead alien but eager to play with the face-raping snake monster?\\" The dialog seemed like it had also been dumbed down I absolutely hate it when scientists in movies speak in gross over-simplifications or misuse their own terminology.    Scientist A: \\"Why did this happen?  Scientist B: \\"Because DNA\\"    When the biologist referred to the theory of evolution as \\"Darwinism,\\" I lost all hope of not being patronized. The only people who use the term \\"darwinism\\" in reference to the theory of evolution are creationists and they do this to equate evolution to a philosophical \\"ism.\\" I do not suspect Damon Lindelof knew this and was merely attempting to sound sciency. Why dumb down a movie like this? Science fiction fans are quite often intelligent people. Why cater to a common denominator and make a mediocre film when you could've made a great film like 2001: A Space Odyssey? In fact, if you want to see great alternative that actually is everything that Prometheus tried to be, get 2001. Ridley Scott would agree. [...]
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the perfect book for me.  It is long, intricate and ends it's chapters without cliff hangers.  I usually read thrillers that keep me reading all night until the end.  That screws up the whole next day.  \\"Winter of the World\\" ends each chapter with the saga of one particular family group.  This allows me to go sleep without being forced to go on. This may sound stupid but the format works for me.<br /><br />The story is sweeping and a continuation from the first book \\"Fall of Giants\\". Follett puts his characters in the turning points of history so as to give the reader a perspective of how one event effects the other events. This is great story telling.
B007M6P01O|5.0|The Walking Dead series is amazing. They keep your attention throughout the entire 1st and 2nd season. After watching season 1 on Netflix I had to buy season 2 on here because it is just so good. Season 3 starts next week, cant wait!
B001TCNSOI|2.0|I went into this movie hoping for a good, hearty \\"mom takes on the world and wins against injustice\\" sort of story. I knew it would be heartbreaking and sad, but I hoped it would have at least some scrap of hope and resolution at the end.<br /><br />It didn't.<br /><br />This movie was nearly 3 hours long. 3 hours of watching Angelina Jolie cry, scream, sob, beg, and break down. Now I will say that her acting was incredible. I can only imagine the emotional fortitude she needed to play that role, to become the distraught, heartbroken mother over and over again, and to do it so perfectly. I also relished John Malkovich (does he EVER do a bad acting job?) and his fearless, heroic role. Yes, the acting from everyone is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from an Eastwood-directed movie. The sets are perfectly Great Depression-ish, with bland washed-out colors and lots of great historic costumes and locations.<br /><br />But the story. Good Lord. \\"Depressing\\" doesn't even describe it. As mother to a 12 year old boy myself, I can't even conceive of how I would function if he went missing. Watching Jolie cry and sob over and over... and over... that was hard enough on my maternal instincts. I kept waiting for some good thing, some positive slant, some bit of hope that her son would be found, that he'd be alive, SOMETHING.<br /><br />But no. It just dragged on. Jolie weeps. The cops are mean to her. She weeps some more. The cops are even meaner. She screams and weeps more. We learn about the murderer and his other victims. More crying. Court room scenes. Sober faces. Crying. The movie ends stating that Mrs. Collins never stopped searching for her son.<br /><br />THAT'S supposed to be an ending? We just watched this woman mourn and grieve for three hours while the LA police treat her like garbage. And THAT'S the ending? She doesn't find her son. She never even knows if he's alive (chances are, he wasn't, of course, since he never reappeared or contacted her again).<br /><br />If you're in a terribly good mood, and you just need something to bring you down and shame you for ever cracking a smile... watch this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of drama, even tragedy, but dang it, give me something at the end to hold onto! Some hint of hope or happiness or redemption. I will never watch this movie again.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Met my expectations. Came in perfect condition and was exactly right. No problems at all with it.  Absolutely love this series it would be a perfect gift for just about anyone!
B008IZ6OAE|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever made! Well acted and well written. I can't wait for season 7!!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|this book was very well written and I enjoyed this book so much!  It kept me on the edge of my seat and I never wanted to put the book down.
B007AJFSJW|3.0|I just finished this book. It took me almost 3 weeks to read it. I enjoy reading non-technical economics books, specially when they are written by a brilliant author, such as Krugman (I studied \\"international economics\\" by reading his book). Prof. is, obviously, Keynesian, and he is not shy about it. He is extremely critical on those not sharing his views, something I don't really like; there is a non-trivial risk of dogmatism. Moreover, Prof. Krugman spends many many pages citing American politicians. This is not bad by itself (neither good; personally I don't like that), but it's pretty boring for a non-american reader. Anyway, the book conveys an interesting proposal. For those eager to read the book, I will not spoil it describing such a proposal (although you should know that is pretty much the same US gov. did in the 30s; it's a Big (but not New) Deal).<br />That said, I felt that Krugman's book is too lengthy. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same ideas could have fit in a shorter book (half of this one).
0312330537|4.0|I picked up Shantaram at Bombay Central Station, just minutes before boarding a train to Rajasthan. With the Gregory Roberts mammoth perched on my knees, I peered through the window as the train cleared the last chaotic suburbs of Mumbai, the city that'd been my home for the last couple of months. Shantaram, I was assured, painted a unique, vibrant picture of the city I was leaving and the country I was discovering so I turned to page one with high expectations. Many laughs and gasps later, my nails chewed to the quick, we pulled into Jaipur Station; the 14-hour journey had passed in a flash.    Shantaram charts the enthralling adventures of an Australian convict nicknamed Lin, who, having escaped from a life sentence in his home country, builds a new life for himself in Bombay.  The exiled Australian's rare mixture of white man, medic, felon and intellectual make him uniquely attractive to an unlikely swath of Bombay's poor, its ambitious and its criminal. Though a work of fiction, the life of Shantaram's author has sufficient parallels to the protagonist's to vest the story with an extra layer of depth. Roberts' personal love and knowledge of the city Lin makes his home are so rooted in fact that anyone who has visited Mumbai, even many years later, can't help but smile or nod in recognition of many of the people, places, smells and sounds described.    Within hours of his arrival in India, Lin meets Prabaker a slum-dwelling taxi driver come tour-guide whose honest smile and genuine friendship add a warm foil to a flawed, oft selfish protagonist. Soon added to his list of acquaintances are Karla, the beautiful and enigmatic Swiss-American expat who steals Lin's heart, Didier, an incorrigible French homosexual with a penchant for liquor and irony, Abdullah the handsome mafia killer who becomes a brother to Lin and a whole host of similarly charismatic personalities tied in varying degrees to slums, drugs, scams, and Café Leopold (a Mumbai institution that survivesto this day with just as much panache, if a little less intrigue). As his money runs out Lin, the ex-junkie bank robber, is seduced back into a life of crime. His life as outlaw is nevertheless imbued with currents of honour, loyalty, love and courage that not only normalize such a lifestyle but allow it an air of nobility. Central to constructing this aura of distinction is Lin's professional and personal relationship with a local mafia don, an eloquent Afghan named Abdel Khader Khan. Despite his ruthlessness Khader's moral compass forbids him to engage in the most distasteful of felonies (selling heroin, sex, children, and pornography); he takes on the role of teacher and father-figure to Lin lending his philosophical discussions a degree of gravity and sincerity they might otherwise lack. Under the veil of fatherly love but with motives that are far from altruistic, Khader deliberately draws Lin deeper into Bombay's Mafia network and later into dangerous pursuits that take him to Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan.    The sheer breadth of experiences and challenges Lin is faced with -life as a slum medic, drug dealer, lover, prisoner, and soldier - are enough to keep any reader on their toes. The broader interplay of politics, social upheaval and hidden agendas are seamlessly interwoven. Furthermore Roberts is continually introducing and reintroducing characters as varied as counterfeiters, slum lords, journalists and Bollywood producers- whose stories are artfully tied to Lin's. It is the relationships with these friends, neighbours and enemies that make the book truly fascinating.    At 940 pages Shantaram requires quite an investment in time, effort, and unless you stumble on a lucky second hand copy, money; is it worth it? Absolutely. The author has a truly magnificent way of describing people, which combines genuine affection, with very witty, often laugh out loud conversations, so that the friendships, betrayals and love affairs have a rich, natural progression that bring the characters to life. At the half way mark I was almost convinced I might have found the best book I'd ever read.    Unfortunately it's about this stage that the writing slips a notch or two. Every paragraph is heaped with similes and metaphors that are far from necessary. At this point Roberts also introduces the philosophy of life mentioned above, and despite attempts to give the intellectual musings weight through Khader, they smack of self indulgence and, in their repetitiveness, begin to grate (I am guilty of skimming past a few paragraphs I admit).    Another criticism levelled by an Indian friend of mine was that the book gave a reductionist portrayal of Indians and Indian society, which ranged from over-generalization to stereotyping and ridicule. I disagree wholeheartedly with this assessment however. Roberts characters are all slightly larger than life, their smiles a bit bigger, their excesses a little more dramatic, their strengths a little grander but I found, perhaps because I read it whilst still in India, that this reflected a more general Indian feeling; it seemed to channel the loud, bright, chaotic, madness so distinctive about India. There are few Indians in the book who are portrayed wholly negatively and if some of the customs induce unexpected guffaws -two grown men being chaperoned by their dates' mother over dinner- it is because the rigidity of many traditional aspects of Hindu/Muslim India do seem comically outdated to the outsider.    When it came to description of the slums, in which both the protagonist and the author lived at various stages, Roberts artfully juxtaposes the poverty and destitution that defines such environments with the determination and love that held them together. However, where poverty met criminality the author was often a little to quick to distance his protagonist and he never does accept Lin's inevitable complicity in the darkest aspects of his new world- drug addiction, prostitution and child slavery.  In truth, Lin is perhaps the least likeable character. He is often a tad too self-congratulatory about his ability to adapt, assimilate and `objectively' assess his own feelings and failings. A clear example of this, is his exacerbating repetition that he has been able to enter somewhere, survive something or befriend someone because he speaks not just Hindi, but Marathi (the regional language of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is capital). Although his language skills were remarkable, there was no need to mention them on over a dozen occasions. A degree of arrogance in the author is apparent in many of his interviews, his website, and has led many to avoid reading his book because they find him personally nauseating. Though this at times seeps into the stylistic flourishes of the book it does little to detract from a really good story. Shantaram is epic fiction, not social commentary and in that at least it is a beautifully constructed tale and a book I recommend without hesitation.    (From my blog: [...])

B00061RZBA|3.0|I purchased this wanting to add it to my DVD collection, but I didn't realize what I was getting.  I didn't know what it meant when you purchase a DVD created for a region outside of your own country origin.  I live in the United States, which I have now learned is Region 1.  I no longer own an actual DVD player, so I use my computer to play DVDs.  Windows Media Player gives you the option to change your region 4 times, so I changed it in order to watch the DVD, and changed it back so I could continue to watch the rest of my DVDs.  I was a little unhappy when I realized that I can't really watch Mulan again without risking getting kicked out of region 1 so I could no longer view the rest of my DVDs.  Perhaps this is my own fault for not researching what I was getting before I purchased it, but now I know not to purchase DVDs for anything other than region 1.  In addition, it took several weeks for the DVD to ship to me here in the US which was a little annoying.  I think it came from China, but that amount of waiting for something as small as a DVD was a little ridiculous.  Lesson learned.

0385344333|1.0|Just go to your accounts -orders-returns on Amazon and return the darn thing. If this is difficult, email Amazon customer support and explain you were scammed by a ghost-written product falsely advertised as having been written by Lee Childs. DEMAND a refund.<br />Although about half of reviewers have been taken in by this ghost-written garbage, half were not. Can I prove this was ghost-written? NO, but if you buy a $20 bottle of wine, and it tastes like cheap rot-gut, wouldn't you return it? You can't \\"prove\\" they scammed you with cheap stuff, but your senses know it. So you return it and let the power of the market place speak. It's the same here. In my opinion, Mr. Childs is using a ghost writer to build his bank account without exercising his honest craft.<br />So you must return the book and pass on this word.<br />Another thing I find disturbing about the recent Childs ghost-written efforts is the anti-American caricatures and scenes badly distorting who Americans are, and yes, now you mention it, we pulled the english bacon out of the fire in WW2. Possibly Childs is writing for the America-haters in Europe or the middle east as a bigger market.<br />In any case, return this adulterated, low quality product. Its your right, and the purveyors of this nonsense don't have a moral leg to stand on. Don't put up with it for a second.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very well done movie. Nice to see older actors in a well created movie. The relationships in this movie well thought out.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I, as well as many others, enjoyed the twists and turns of \\"Gone Girl\\" that i immediately went to \\"Dark Places\\". Boy, am i glad i did. the character development in this page-turner is so twisted that the reader can't help but feel sorry for these lost lonely souls. The pain of adolescence of a confused teenager and the \\"friends\\" he surrounds himself with are truly just as upsetting as the animal sacrificing that occurs. also, teh only reason i gave my rating 4 instead of 5 stars.<br />I am an animal lover and saddened when anything bad happens to one, however, in this book, its almost like it was supposed to happen. The description of what happens in the sacrifice is so important to Ben's story and his guilt or innocence that, although painful to read, made this story one i will never forget. Gillian Flynn has a knack of writing characters that, in most cases, the reader would feel unsympathetic towards, but in her books, you almost feel so sad for the bad guy that you want them to win out in the end. I recommend this book to a reader who enjoys emotional twists and turns as well as twisted endings.

Rock anthems, ballads and combinations thereof (sung enthusiastically but horribly by everybody except Mary J.)  Any fan of `80s rock will be so totally immersed in the music that you won't notice that the performances give karaoke a bad name.<br /><br />2. Vertically-challenged Tom Cruise strutting his leathers and furs like he's the biggest, baddest, raunchiest rock star that ever lived.<br /><br />3. The costumes, the hair, the cell phones, those round black things sold at Tower Records, the promiscuity, and oh yes, the sugar-sappy-sweet romance story-line.<br /><br />Forget the corny plot, Russell Brand's wig and the minor roles played by major talent and consider this a time capsule from the `80s that crash-landed on a DVD player near you.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 8, 2012
B005FVNJTS|4.0|Excellently written with insight into the person of Nadal not just the tennis player. More a personal tennis story than a review of games.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have gotten very addicted to this game. It's really fun and even better is that it''s free. If you are the kind of person who doesn't like to spend money on apps, (like me) I strongly suggest you get this game.
1426308469|4.0|I ordered this book for my 2 1/2 year old. He is really into dinosaurs and loves to learn facts (age appropriate) about them. This book has great detailed pictures and a number of facts for each dinosaur. We read this book almost every day and I always find something new to talk about with him.
0812992784|3.0|I like Salman Rushdie as a cultural figure more than I have ever liked his writing. I had forgotten about him over the last decade so when the chance to catch up with this memoir I jumped at it and was largely transfixed by the tale despite its repetitions, its occasional whininess, occasional bad taste (did we really need comic book versions of Thai and French accents?), and lack of nuance in his portraits of not a few world historical figures.<br /><br />To be fair, most people who went through what Rushdie did would probably be in an insane asylum...not continuing to write literature. His dedication to writing is awe inspiring. He deserves all the accolades he has received even though he was less than honorable towards the women in his life...even if they were flawed a gentleman would have gotten his revenge in a more fictional frame, not by taking us into his succession of depressed bedrooms.<br /><br />Also, his account of his affair/marriage with the Indian bimbo Padma Lakshmi turns him into a caricature of himself...pudgy, nerdy little scribbler throws over his faithful but boring english hausfrau for a sub-continental curvaceous cutie only to be dumped when she turns out to be just as shallow as he suspected...but oh, those legs. Oh those curves!  \\"Anybody would make the same choice, right boys?\\"<br /><br />Sorry Salman...even though your private hell has since become ours you still lose points for judgment and your self righteousness. A little more English stiff upper lip (and discretion for the women who were never your real enemy even though you would want us to believe otherwise) would have been more inspirational.<br /><br />In any event, I for one am glad you got your life back and wish you well and thank you for letting us know what it was like. A horror story to be sure.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Great Game I purchased for my Fire.  Occasionally hangs up but runs quite well for the most part.  Lot's of fun to play.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Very good book - wouldn't rate it among my favorites, but I did really like it.  Great story of personal discovery.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|Daniel Radcliffe is great in The Woman In Black. It is written well, and shows a movie does not need blood and slashing to build suspense. Camera work, good acting and well lit, or unlit rooms can still stop your heart. This is a very good movie that delivers twists, turns, Daniel looking great and a very good plot.
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie was cute, but at least 20 minutes too long...The editor made a mistake with not cutting more.  Again we enjoyed the movie but it was 20 minutes too long.
B000274THQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for its amusing story, its peek at the GDR during its freedom transition, the touching and thought-provoking relationship between son and mother - and to bring extra dimension to that - a musical theme that I eventually recognized to be a soft rendition of Haddaway's \\"What is Love\\".<br /><br />The unusual story and visual backdrops of this story really just grease the slides for something deeper that I feel is the true heart and soul of it; namely, the intertwined questions \\"What is Love?\\", and \\"Should he have told her the truth?\\".  The latter question emerges no more than a third of the way through in the form of \\"WILL he tell her the truth?\\".  That question morphs into \\"should he?\\" as the mother begins to regain herself and reveals some secrets about the family's past, until at the end we're left hanging on it.  So should he have?  We'll never know.  The first question, though, is clearly what drove the son's own decision about how to handle his mother's predicament.<br /><br />Personally I was disturbed by the ending, because either of two equally-plausible alternatives could have brought it home better for me.  I almost gave the movie a '3' for that, but, it has too many other things going for it to be just average.  My real rating is 3.5.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I found Settlers of Catan a fun game to play with my family. The game play helps you learn the art of strategy, thinking ahead, and working with others. I only rate the durability average because if you have young children, it simply wont hold up to them. This does not mean it's poor quality. Just wont survive younger children if not kept out of their reach. As with all products, parents are key :)
0316227706|5.0|I got my book today and it was even better than I could have imagined.  Seth does such a great job getting each dog's personalities to come out on camera.  I couldn't help but smile and laugh when I flipped through the book and looked at each picture.  I highly recommend this book for every dog person.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you're reading this review then you should have already read the first four books in the series.  I won't give anything away but there are a lot of unexpected plot twists complete with the death of some great characters and some not so great characters.<br />I love all the song of ice and fire series and this is no exception.  If you've read the other books then pick this one up and continue in the amazing world that could only come from the mind of George R. R. Martin.
B006YC74E8|2.0|Well, I was just looking for stuff at the app store wheni saw it, so I downloaded it but when I tryed it out, it wasn't awesome.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is a great book about a real american hero.  Firsthand insight into the lives of Navy Seals.  The first half of the book covers his career that brought him to the Osama compound and the second half explains the raid in very good detail.  Very exciting although a short read.  Understandably there are lots of details left out but you also learn about some of the gear they use.  For instance, the NVG's (Night Vision Goggles) they use cost $65,000!<br />All in all I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting and enjoyable read.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I do not know what the big deal is with people and this game.  I don't particularly like it much and seldom played it in the beginning and now I never play it.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|The sound track from this movie is awesome!  Everyone around me kept saying that Pierce Brosnan (sp?) should not have sung, but I give him lots of credit for having fun with it, staying on key and singing his songs with great passion.  Loved the CD, loved the movie!  Whenever I go on a long drive, I put the windows down, open the sun roof and let these tunes blast.  Great pick-me-up tunes!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I really liked this movie. I loved the story and the special effects. Definately work renting and I would watch it again!
B000088E6D|5.0|excellent music for relaxing moments, when you cook, when your clean, when you drive in the middle of the traffic of course to calm down those nervs hahaha. To chat, I bought it for a shabby-chic party, was great!
B007N8RULO|4.0|very good spider solitare game. the screen is very bright but that is my only complaint. great free download. recommended
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story is such an inspiring one, especially for anyone who has children. A true story of man's best friend.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|As is normal for a Ken Follett novel, it takes little or no time to get deeply engrossed in this 2nd part of his Trilogy. Ken has the unique ability to take fact, interpolate characters into that fact or facts, to make a brilliant fiction.<br />I would highly recommend this book and look forward to the 3rd part of the Trilogy.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Its a fun game to play, really like it. I'll keep playing till I run out of words.<br />Thank you for a fun product.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was the most heart-warming ,spine tingling story i have ever read whoever write this story cotos to your great work
B007THA4FI|1.0|This was a terrible waste of my time and money!  It did NOT live up to the hype.  I kept reading thinking it would improve....it  didn't !!!  Reading this book was \\"painful\\".  Couldn't wait till the end.  VERY disappointing!!!  jK should stick with a Harry Potter sequel!!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When Facebook first started it wasn't too nosey. Now they keep trying to leech more personal information that I don't want to share with the whole world. Generally I don't tell the truth about myself on Facebook anyway.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Really nice bible for study and enjoyment, numerous editions to choose from and easy to navigate through books in any edition. For me; the audio feature is particularly helpful when studying with a workbook, as you are able to answer questions while listening to audio. Works for me and you can't beat the price, $0.00, and easy to download and install app.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am ready for the next one! When will it be available?  I would recommend highly!  Thanks for all the hints!
B001HN6922|5.0|The price could not be beat and the shipping was fast.  The product had shown up in perfect condition and I really could not ask for more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Anybody who loves anything should get this. I believe that if you combine the open plus free roam characteristics of a game that has not only one game type but two. I totally recommend this game. if you disagree with me on this comment screw you.
B007SGM084|4.0|I really liked how much I could relate to the main charachter during her first encounter with Mr. Christian Grey. It made me remember the first times with my husband (first holding hands, kiss, more). I feel that the sex scenes were a little unreal at times since it would seem that they had sex every few hours for the first 6 months of their relationship, which seems unlikely. But I very much relate to the relationship aspect of this story. It made me appreciate certain aspects of my marriage that I'd lost sight of, what with the kids keeping me sleep deprived for the last few years. :)<br /><br />The setting was very realistic and really let you dive into the persona of Ana. I'd recommend that anyone picking this up look at the relationship side of this, as well as the sex, to spice up an existing relationship or create a spicy new relationship.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another in the constant line of great Reacher books. Read the book in 2 days, could not put it down.
0525953728|5.0|It is a question that will be debated for a long time...Should it have been written or should it not have been written?<br /><br />There is only one vote that matters---and that is the opinion of his fellow SEALS, those on the mission and those in service to the country.<br /><br />It is disturbing that the author would violate his sacred oath to keep secret things secret, but, then again he makes a good point:  If his Commander and Chief, the President of the United States is talking about the mission, why shouldn't he be allowed talk about it--To set the record straight, once and for all, with all the Washington politics out of it? That's a somewhat compelling argument.<br /><br />There doesn't appear to be any so-called security breaches here, but how is an average reader to know? Again, the only people who have an opinion worth seriously considering are his fellow SEALS. What you and I think, and what the politicians in Washington think, really doesn't matter.  We're not the ones putting their life on the line. They are. Therefore they have not only the one vote that counts, but the only vote period.<br /><br />The book starts off slow at first, but speeds up, reaching break-neck speed and emotionsal involvement as the SEALS near Bin Laden's compound.  At times, the reader may find it necesssary to stop, take a breath, consider what has just been read, then take off on the mission again.  The Bin Laden part of the book reminds us old guys of the Walter Cronkite TV show from the fifties and early sixties, \\"You are There\\" in which great, decisive moments of history are recreated.  This book is in that genre and it does it well.<br /><br />There is, however, a lingering concern that the writer may have signed his own death warrant in writing this book.  As with everything else in the United States, today, nothing is ever a secret.  His real name was made public even before the book was published.  In writing this book---and there is no feeling that he wrote it formoney--he endangered not only his own life but the lives of his family and the fellow SEALS who went on this mission. That is why their opinion is the only opinion that matters.<br /><br />Arab terroists have long memories. The men on this mission, and especially the author, will have do deal with this threat, this possibility,the rest of their lives.<br /><br />And may those liveds bde long and fruitful.<br /><br />Should it have been written?  Only the SEALS know for sure and I, for one, trust their judgement.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Eagerly waiting for Book Three.  WINTER OF THE WORLD was not only informative, but easy to read.  Ken Follett is the Genius of historical novels.
B00973CGXK|3.0|The killers didn't go for gold on this album. The songs flow together well, and it seems to be a heavy homage to the 80s. But only a few of the songs really stand out.
B005898DDO|5.0|If you like American music, if you just like music in general, if you like the personalities behind said musics, if you're a particular friend of the rock & roll music, and if you're especially a fan of the Bobby Dylan man and his brand of contemporary music; then you need to have this documentary in your collection!
0345803485|1.0|I feel compell to write a review. A friend mentioned this book to me.  For curious reason, I checked it out from the library.  It was unbearable and unreadable. I want to demand for my time back and I have never felt that way for any other books. It puzzeled me why the book is so popular.  Well, I was one of the readers and I read it simply wanted to find out why it is so popular and I couldn't figure out why.  Maybe the majority of readers have the same motives as I did.  I won't even touch the other two books she wrote.  Sorry.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have to admit it... This is fun, mindless but fun. Sure beats the crude out of playing the real life version!
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I understand that being a 'cheap' copy, I shouldn't expect much. But the packaging was scratched and dented and they sent me a HOMEMADE copy, with the title handwritten on the disc. Is that legal? It was a little grainy and dark, but since I paid so little for it, wasn't worth paying postage to return. The movie itself was awesome. Gruesome, suspenseful..great characters, plot. And Daniel Craig and Stellan Skaarsgard in the same movie? Heaven...at least to this reviewer. Obviously not as in depth as the book, but impossible to be, since the book was so long and involved. But they did a great job. Not for weak stomachs. Aside from the shipper, I loved the movie. But will definitely not order from them again.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Crumbs off of Motown's table is understandable in the early 70s. But how do you explain a whole loaf of talent falling off, and no one in America hears him?<br /><br />I heard of a great singer from today's 60 Minutes show, which was covering a documentary called \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\". The man is Sixto, who wrote and sang protest songs reminiscent of Bob Dylan in early 70s. His records didn't sell, and he was forgotten in the United States, and most of the rest of the world. Except one place: South Africa. There, Sixto was  more popular than either the Beatles or Elvis.<br /><br />The songs in this album are very much dylanesque, but with a better voice. Yet just as powerful politically. Sixto's lyrics suggest exasperation of the circumstances, where he begs the  \\"Sugarman\\" to hurry back \\"colors to my dreams\\" because he's \\"tired of these scenes.\\" The scenes included a mayor that hid the crime rate, as told in \\"This is not a song, it's an outrage.\\"  Garbage wasn't collected either, and gun sales were soaring.  In \\"Hate Street Dialogue\\" he laments the condition of people and the air pollution:  \\"Seamy, seesaw kids / Childwoman on the skids / The dust will choke you blind / The lust will choke your mind.\\" He's describing an industrial hell hole, where humanity is treaded on in lust and greed.<br />The poetry of Sixto, named for being the sixth child in a Mexican-American family, visualizes Detroit in early 70s, and South Africa it turns out.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|The new P!nk album is fun and not a bad song in the lot.  I was surprised to hear Emeniem on one track and Slut Like You is probably my favorite track.  Anyone who can add the line...wham bam thank you maam to a lyric and it sound great is a plus!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I heard bad things about this game... like &quot;It gets boring after a while&quot; or &quot;It's way to hard&quot;, but they're all wrong. This game is my favorite game I have ever gotten on my Kindle Fire! It can be hard at times, but that just makes it more fun in my opinion! This is a must have for everyone!!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I read Reacher because he is interesting and a refreshing change from most mysteries.  He and his characters are always interesting even if the plot is weak as it is in this case.
B0095R64AO|4.0|Entertaining romantic comedy that ends as you would expect. Jason Segal and Emily Blunt have great banter throughout the entire thing
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I hesitated on renting this one because my husband didn't want to watch it, but he was out of town, so I did!  I really liked this version of the story of Snow White and I loved the interesting creatures in the forest they encountered with the dwarves.  Excellent picture quality and playback on my PS3 as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was slow to start, but became very interesting with all the twist and turns.  I was hooked<br />until the end.  I can't wait until we can discuss at our book club meeting.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Years ago I read Dr. Kissinger's doctoral thesis. It was a technical treatise but as I remember, it was, among other things, an analysis of Matternich and Castlereagh and how their influence helped Europe go free of a major war for nearly one hundred years, prior to WW1.<br /><br />I bought this book (Kindle edition), primarily to learn a bit about China, and who better to learn it from than the man who is known for his expertise on China and who may have been be the best Secretary of State in U.S. history. There is a lot of information in this book, from ancient Chinese history almost to today. It is well organized and well written, an easy read.<br /><br />No doubt, this could have been a much longer book.  Mao's continuous revolution, the Vietnam wars, Taiwan, Korea (N.& S.), to name just a few, are areas that were interesting and were briefly covered but about which much more could have been written.<br /><br />There are times when the text seemed a bit self-serving. I felt this true in Dr. Kissinger's explanation of his relations with Zaou and particularly so later, with Deng Xiaoping. No matter, this is quite an excellent book.<br /><br />In the latter chapters and particularly in the Epilogue of the book, I recognized the thoughts of Matternich and Castlereagh (particurally Matternich) in Dr. Kissinger's analysis of the proper relationship to be developed between countries (emphasis between the U.S. and China) for the mutual benefit of each. These ideas have evidently stayed with Dr. Kissinger all of these years, and have had a significant influence on his very successful career.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is very useful for keeping track of battery levels and temps and stuff. Hence the phrase, &quot;boss app yo!&quot;
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|One thing R. Scott can still do is shoot breathtaking visuals.<br /><br />However, the plot is, for the lack of the better word, retarded. Before I completely loose faith in the creator of Blade Runner, I would like to see a director's cut. Perhaps it was the studio execs who buchered the movie.<br /><br />Non-Spoiler alert:<br /><br />The plot is something like this: A bunch of college kids go to the haunted house because they are bored.  Almost right away the kids see that things are \\"strange\\" there but they proceed in a more careless fashion than they set out.  Naturally few of them die in spectacular fashion.  That fact has no impact on the survivors who continue to be even more careless. The local deputy, with his own agenda, sabotages few good ideas few of the kids have. Kids proceed to have more fun.  A storied monster creator shows up quickly followed by the out of control created monster. More kids die.  Monster kills its creator (franchise potential abounds). Lone kid survives and apparently escapes.<br /><br />Now take this plot, make kids into scientists, put the them into spacesuits, sprinkle a generous amount of pseudo scientific jargon and drop them off-world = Prometheus.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|if u really like her songs, i can say that u don't really know what is MUSIC. She is okay for me but people's overrated r making me sick. people said she is so talented, if u want to know what is called Talented, listen Celine Dion, Whitney Huston, Mariah Carey, Beyonce, Christina Aguilera. I wanna suggest this to people.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I really recommend it.This game is very fun and it is very exciting.Please get it.
B009KUANWG|1.0|this is insane, can't believe people listen  that kind of trash. i stopped it after 30sec of listening. How lucky Adele is but i just listened the worst song  with my own ears. people should know she is just lucky.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love it. Somehow challenging and relaxing at the same time. A must-have for anyone with a brain and a phone.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A really good read.  Laugh out funny and an interesting tour through important parts of world history.  Better than Forrest Gump and more believable.
B003NTMREM|5.0|I love this show its amazing! It is an awesome show. I love how it is connected with doctor who!
B0088WFZQG|4.0|In spite of the fact that many of the roles were played by Navy Seals, and some of the acting more suited to community theatre, by and large, these guys and gals did a very good job. Having trained in martial arts with a green beret commander, I can attest to the fact that SOC sailors and soldiers are a special breed of folk who deserve to have their stories recorded and passed down so that our children can read them in history classes one day.
030758836X|4.0|Part of the reason I'd read it as quickly as I cold, was because I wanted to get to the dramatic, unbelievably plot twists that other reviewers kept writing angry reviews about. I know others had claimed major dissatisfaction with the ending as well, so I wanted to read about that too.<br /><br />The first half of the book is really engaging. The chapters alternate between the husband's POV and the missing wife's diary. The author did an excellent job of making you sympathize with whichever character's point of view you were reading at the time.<br /><br />Then about halfway through the book is when you get the major plot twist that I assume other reviewers have buzzed about. I didn't find it unbelievable, no. In fact, I was surprised that so many people had such a problem with it.<br /><br />As far as the ending... I can see why that's the one thing you'll hear the most complaints about here. I don't want to spoil the ending. It is the type of ending that I would normally be up-in-arms about as well, but with this book, it actually works for me. The husband's motivation, at the end, for choosing to do what he did, seemed a little muddled and convenient (for the author), so I lost a little believability there. Like \\"Oh, he's going to...? Why again? Oh... I... GUESS I get it?\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless, I recommend this book. Like the \\"Most Helpful Review\\" says, stop reading reviews about this book, and just read the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|easy to use and clear pictures! I'm so glad that this is now an app, it's very convient and helpful when on the go!
B00992CF6W|4.0|i really like minecraft but seriously $7!!!!! u could at lesat drop the price a little so my mom will actully buy it for me. PLZZZZZZZZ DROP THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0307352145|5.0|Quiet: The Power Of Introverts In A World That Can't Stop Talking is a monumental accomplishment.  Frankly, this author may have discovered why so many Americans, living in great wealth and prosperity vis a vis the world's socio economic mean, are being medicated for depression at such an alarming rate.  Just read the preface and you will see the value.  Thank you for investing these years gathering and thinking through this issue.  You may actually change part of the world.
B0086700CM|5.0|its alot of fun  and entertaining to play you wint get bored if you do start over and play again its great game for every age!!!!!!!!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I really, really love Pinterest and I love that the app is free, but it force closes on my Kindle a lot and it is really slow at times. If those problems were fixed then it would definentally be worthy of a five star rating.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but was disappointed with the ending.  It was just a little flat.  Also, after a while the characters got to be a little annoying.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very awesome app. my whole family uses it all the time. thanks for such s fabulous app. so nice to have free and functionable apps. definitely reccommend!
B003L77GW4|1.0|Hateful, self-important, vendictive, little people!<br /><br />I'm talking about the ones that made the decision not to release season 2 to blu-ray!<br /><br />What other reason could there be.<br /><br />I am sure that they will find some excuse to continue \\"crapping\\" on their loyal fans.<br /><br />Pathetic ingrates all!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|download it for hours of entertainment. I played it from 5pm to 7. wwe saved me. the thing that makes it better than the real thing is you get 1 extra coin every 30 seconds and a lot of things drop to make ot easier to shove coins.
0062082353|5.0|Once I started reading it I couldn't set it down...It was a great book from start to finish. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how a sniper spends his days and life.

B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest, but the app for the my kindle keeps \\"force closing\\"!  I have Pinterest on my iphone and laptop and do not have this problem.  Very frustrating.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Interesting and funny.  The character's descriptions are defined in great detail. Ken Follett's writing make learning history fun!  I can't wait to start the next book.
B003L77G6A|4.0|I have been a fan of this show since the very first season. Actually, this show, believe it or not, had a predecessor that was VERY similar in character breakdown called \\"Dweebs\\", starring Peter Scolari, Cory Feldman and a few other semi-famous folk. It was actually pretty funny and got the feel of the dot.com world down to a gnat's wazoo, but only lasted a half a season. I'm so glad to see that \\"Big Bang\\" is in its sixth season and still going strong. I've been rooting for it all along.<br /><br />What a formula! Four nerdy friends, all of them with doctorates except one, (who never hears the end of it,) who STILL read comic books, who dote on popular science fiction franchises and who are strangers to normal male/female relationships to a large degree...and who are indistinguishable from 17-18 year old virgin high school boys! How could it miss!? There's Sheldon, KING of the anal retentives, right down to the perfectionist attitude, the supreme confidence in his own ability and importance, who thinks he is the center of the known universe, Leonard, his classically nerdy best friend, who semi-masochistically endures his nonsense; Howard Wollowitz, the classic Jewish momma's boy with all the Philip Roth demons in attendance! Then there's Raj....a Hindu, still with the accent, with VERY Old World-y attitudes mixed with a savvy but naive carriage in Pasadena California. All set off against the typical All-American Girl in Penny, a totally normal, regular young lady from Nebraska. Absolutely perfect!<br /><br />Chuck Lorre, as far as I'm concerned, is the new James Burrows.... for, with the exception of \\"Mike & Molly\\", this man can do no wrong as far as TV comedy is concerned. (And even \\"M&M\\" is doing well in the ratings!) \\"Big Bang\\" is EASILY my favorite sitcom of the moment, and has been for the last three years! But a couple of things bothers me.... why does Leonard have Sheldon's mother??? And why is Leonard, who, let's face it, is THE classic nerd of the four of them, (he's always disheveled, wears glasses, is short and talks like he's apologizing for something all the time,) why is he the big lady's man of the quartet?? He's landed: Leslie Winkle, Penny, Pria, Dr. Stephanie, the North Korean spy and NONE of the other three have had the same or similar record! What gives?!<br /><br />Nonetheless, this has got to be yet another jewel in CBS' sitcom diadem and proves that when good sitcoms are made, chances are there's CBS talent behind it!hem, (he's always disheveled, wears glasses, is short and talks like he's apologizing for something all the time,) why is he the big lady's man of the quartet??

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|I never saw the movie in the theaters, but thought that a different version of Snow White would be a refreshing family movie. It was okay, but the acting was not up to par. When compared to Mirror Mirror which came out before this, I would was better than Snow White and the Huntsman. There is only one saving grace for this movie that it was not too violent to it makes for an okay family movie.
0316228532|5.0|This is a brilliant and powerful novel. With fearless accuracy Rowling describes what is ugliest and then goes deeper- drilling down to the deepest truth of all- the inexplicable beauty hidden in ugliness. In life we go through changes, and the characters in this novel go through deep changes- and I changed with them. As human beings we are saddled with selfishness and smallness, yet sometimes the walls of egotism are torn down and something  surprising comes through. The last several chapters build up to a crescendo ending. Without sentimentality or shallowness, going down into the grittiest of human experiences, J.K. Rowling manages to find jewels of redemption.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is cool and ok. it could be better though .I still like it though.I like to play these games.
1423140605|4.0|this is a great book in general. The only problem is it is not what readers were expecting. Rick Riodans previos books in this siries had a lot more action than \\"The Mark Of Athena\\" did. though I did have an exceptional liking for the choach that liked hitting things and blowing stuf up.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|My kindle was perfect with the stand for using on a plane-And sharing between people.  Very easy, good angle.  If you're going to use a stand, this one works.  It does add weight, but any stand would.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great storyline that kept me guessing until the very end. Seriously hot romance, mystery and great writing make for a page-turner from the very beginning. Read this, you will not be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A good game if you like collecting shiny things for a goal and have time riding a bus, waiting on a copier, or a plane to board.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I was bored and decided to go to the movies while my wife was out of town.  So, I just randomly selected a move based on the time of day I would be available.  This movie had a very good plot, the acting was well above average and the filming was outstanding.  I am not one for trying to analyze cinematography nor am I a person that gives my opinion on things I don't think matter.  This, in my opinion, was well worth watching because it was Sci-Fi, had a lot of action and kept my attention.  I spent 20 years in the military so my only criticism is that the main character's discipline from the Navy is totally out of sync with the real military.  But, who cares, if it is fun to watch with a bag of popcorn and soda on a rainy day when your sweetheart is out of town.  So I bought the DVD in case I have similar circumstances someday.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|If you're a Grisham fan, of any age, you'll enjoy this book. Great for kids, lots of fun, interesting, informative and exciting stuff. This is a great series.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|First, I do not like Glee, but I LOVE this movie. However, I have taken two friends on two different occasions to see it that like Glee and they LOVED it too. I have seen it 3 times in one week! This movie is for you if you liked the humor in Ted, Hangover or Bridesmaids. Or, if you like sexy chics (Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp) or sexy dudes (Skylar Astin). Or perhaps you just appreciate good voices making music and/or re-mixed music. Oh, and if you haven't had a crush in a while ladies...you're going to after watching this movie. ;-)
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Great story and a great writer. The real historical scenarios are a major bonus.  Even the romance is adventurous.  And the kindle version isn't full of typos either - thankyou!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was skeptical before reading...reviews I have heard from friends etc were very mixed. It seems you either love it or hate it.<br />I am in the \\"love it\\" category.<br />It's true that perhaps this is not a Pulitzer prize winning novel (although who am I to judge) BUT in terms of entertainment...which is why I read...it's GREAT! I love the characters and the story and have recently started on the final book (hopefully there will be more).<br /><br />Contrary to some of the reviews where I have heard it categorized as \\"kitchen porn\\"...well I guess it depends on what you've been reading. I think the hype is far more x-rated than what you will actually read. A lot will still be your imagination. I have no idea why it's behind the counter at our London Drugs retailers...I've certainly read \\"racier\\" books that were available on the book shelves. Maybe that was a good marketing ploy.<br /><br />If you want to read something light, sexy and easy...this is a great pick!<br />I would recommend this to men too but it might not be visual enough for them. :)<br /><br />PS who do you see as Christian in the apparently upcoming movie? (Google Matt Bomer and see what you think??!)
B003Q6CUAI|1.0|Someone please help me!  I stuck to this diet for 10 days and lost only 2 lbs and nothing since.  I AM NOT CHEATING! Following it exactly.  Is anyone else having this problem?
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry. It literally hurt to put down. Great story, compelling characters locations and people that feel real. Overall just amazing. I enjoyed it more than the lord of the ring books and the Harry Potter books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would recommended this book to anyone!! It keeps you on your toes and constantly wondering what will happen next.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|George R. R. Martin further develops the stories of some characters and introduces some new.  It's nice to see some of the story fitting into the bigger picture.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|A lot of supence and action, the ending was not what i expected  , but relly not quite sure what i expected
B00333NCTM|4.0|If you're a fan of Ozzy or Black Sabbath, then this book is for you.  Very funny and surprisingly well written.  (I am guessing Sharon played a big part in this.)  I highly recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|loved this book more than the first. loved how eva held her own and was totally devoted to gideon. loved the continued bond that was between them. cant wait for next book
B0088D3PYE|5.0|Zafon succeeds in drawing the reader into an intriguing and Gothic world, first created in \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" and developed further in \\"The Angels game\\". We are re-acquainted with many of the characters we met in those books and learn a little more of the mysteries which surround them. Once again we meet Sen&oacute;r Sempere, Daniel and Ferm&iacute;n. We spend time in the Sempere bookshop and get to visit once again the Cemetery of lost Books. But there are darker places from Spain's recent past, where terrible things have happened that serve to shape the lives of our heroes and villains. A figure out of that darkness threatens to destroy the future of our friends and they struggle to unravel the mysteries that emerge in his wake. They also have to find a credible identity for Ferm&iacute;n who is intent on marrying his beloved Bernarda. This is resolved at the end of the book but the story remains unfinished. I look forward to the fourth installment but when it is all over I will be saddened to leave this intriguing world and all its inhabitants behind.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you like the other books in this series, then you will LOOOOOOVE this book.  The storyline REALLY picks up the pace and starts to get REALLY good really fast.  I could not put the book down!
1422352862|1.0|just annoyed....typically have no problems...but we liked the book that was pictured, and we did not receive that.  The book we received was entirely black.  too annoying to return it, considering it was not very expensive...just wanted people to know.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was a good read on the same level as \\"Gone Girl\\".  I liked the twists and turns which the novel took.
0316228532|1.0|Really disappointed. I started this book with a blank slate, forgetting everything about her previous books. I gave it a try, and even started reading it a second time.. thinking I didn't read it properly and perhaps that is why it wasn't very good. No. It's just not very good at all. Avoid at all costs.
B007MG360G|5.0|the game is easily addictive; played both doodle god and doodle devil, this is the best so far; keep the games coming!
1451662432|5.0|This was a good read. Helps me understand the man of mystery a little more. Politics is what makes this book interesting. Would recommend to others.
0316228532|5.0|I will warn anyone thinking of buying this book  on the basis of their love of the Harry Potter novels that they may well be dissapointed. Those were fun books and enjoyable to read, but this is a truly great novel. I've seen reviewers who pan it for being \\"plodding,\\" a novel in which \\"nothing happens.\\" I would have to disagree, and do so strongly. Yes, there is not a great deal of action if one means that term in the way it is applied to Hollywood movies. But every page is filled with engagingly deep character studies and fascinating insights into the human condition. It amazes me the way in which Rowling paints a portrait of a town that is so outwardly idyllic, but in which there is so much seething conflict seemingly hidden behind every door and every hedge. Along the way she encourages us to think about what goes on within the human psyche, to consider waht drives the people around us, to be sympathetic toward, or at least understanding of, the flaws that we all possess.<br /><br />If you enjoy psychologically complex novels, especially in the typically \\"English\\" vein in which the action consists largely of interpersonal--and intrapersonal--conflict, snatch this book up right away. But if you're looking for a fast read that requires nothing of you, The Casual Vacancy is certainly not for you.
0345803485|3.0|The wife didn't care for this book. I thought that being the media craze that surrounds this book it would be ok. She rates it 3 out of 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun and lots to do. very little down. time. highly recommend it. can't put it down. I'm addicted.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this appworked for the first week I had it I bought this KF brand new so there is nothing wrong with my kindle. that app crapes out and they say its fixed but its not.
0385536828|1.0|I'd never read his books before but hey, he had movies made of his work. He makes good money and mostly has good reviews. Surely I'll like it...<br /><br />I do not. Is it a good story? Yes, but the way it's told does not work for me. Key word: TOLD. We are told the entire tale, not shown. There's also a ridiculous amount of description and details about things and people that are totally unnecessary for us to know more about. Her first bf being gay, irrelevant. The folds of fat on her old lover's abdomen, irrelevant.<br /><br />The heroine herself is rather difficult to like and relate to. For all her rambling, she comes across as cold. I simply couldn't connect.
B0084YCKMU|5.0|This episode of Sherlock is a perfect example of the intrigue and twist and turns of the show. The classic age old duel between Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty is played out with excellent cinematography and keeps you questioning yourself till the very end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the THREE Fifty Shades of Gray books so much that I have my husband reading them. AMAZING!! I have recommended it to several others and I constantly ask them what they think and what part are they on because I'm so interested in what they think about it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great as always.  if you like Reacher its great and I still can NOT see Tom the tiny Cruse as Jack Reacher.. Jack is 6 and a half feet tall and 250 plus pounds.. Tom is a teeny guy.. yuck
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Although a big fan of fantasy and science fiction going back to my very long lost youth, I never got on the George RR Martin bandwagon. Even after Game of Thrones was a big HBO hit I never watched it, and I love HBO shows. Finally, my son told me I had to watch the HBO series so I bought Season 1. And was instantly addicted. Watched the entire first season in a few days then caught up on season 2 which was then on-going. Then waited anxiously for each new episode. Then, in reverse of my usual practice, read the books. Now I'm stuck waiting for the next season of the show or the new book to come out.<br /><br />I enjoy the grittiness of this series. The characters are not ivory tower stereotypes so often encountered in fantasy novels. These characters do all the things real people do including dying at unexpected times.<br /><br />And a special thanks to Amazon for the extremely generous preview for this bundle. The preview was longer than some books I've bought!
B000W11JGG|5.0|This was always one of my favorite albums and I think Elton John's best album. He does so many different sounds on it and as usual his piano playing is great.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Glad I didn't pay full fare at the theater.  This just looked sappy compared to Battle Royale, a Japanese movie that is much darker but in better touch with reality when people are placed in such extreme circumstances.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|NOTE:  Do NOT buy this product from private Amazon sellers - Lego.com has actually cracked down on private sectors buying up stock and doubling the profits recently.  You can purchase this product from the lego.com website (limit 1 per person - and believe me, they mean it!) for $34.99 plus shipping and taxes.  This item has recently been restocked at the lego.com website and they intend to make sure that people who want this item get it.<br /><br />Another note, I've heard this box is small - 5\\" to 6\\" square at most.  The pieces that make up the toy are small but they're definitely neat to create and recreate the minecraft world.  I would argue this is probably going to be the best toy that can allow that kind of creativity.  I'm thankful that someone created it.  My children love legos and they love minecraft so I'm thankful they have combined the two.<br /><br />Lego.com is still overpriced in my opinion, but it's ridiculous that people have purchased hundreds of these from lego.com and sat on them - marking up the price and making a profit off of you.  Thank you lego.com for stopping this mayhem (at least for now).  :)
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The story and the cast looked good especially when viewing the trailer.  The movie didn't deliver and I was left disappointed.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|The Intel i3 is one of the many great sandy bridge processors, Its fast, Its decent, and its Intel.  I use This CPU for gaming, Video making, web browsing, and other uses. So far its done great with the tasks. Basically to some it up, If you do work in between web browsing to Mid range Gaming  this CPU is for you. Keep in mind, since this is an L.G.A 1155 socket, when the i3 can't handle future work, you can always upgrade to an i5/i7 or an Xeon. That's my plan what I'm going to do in 2 years. Hope I helped, Thanks for reading :)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|In high school music class at 3PM when we were told of the shooting and   sent home.  I have often wondered, what if....esp. while in Vietnam.   Now I know.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Paid for it because. it was a great app and they deserved it. had free work great highly recomend like the colors
B0055SWM08|5.0|All I have to say is, what a good and clever game. Before you know it, you are spending hours and hours on this game. For anyone who enjoys puzzle and strategy games, buy this.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|i havent open the movie, its a birthday gift for my granddaughter. it came new like it said its wraped & has the box it slides in. so i am sure it will play, being new.happy with it.
B00190OHD6|4.0|It's a very touchy feeling movie, I don't usually cry but this one made me. I truly admire their love and especially his.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I think this is the perfect \\"airplane book.\\" It was fun, light-hearted and could be read in one long flight. It was smart and funny without being too involved.<br /><br />The hard thing about writing about John Scalzi is that we know just how good he can be. Old Man's War is one of the best sci-fi books from the current generation of writers. It's highly entertaining, thought-provoking, and believable with only some slight stretches of the imagination. Red Shirts does not reach that level of performance, but I did enjoy it tremendously. The playful nod to the classic Star Trek episodes was cute but not enough to sustain an entire novel. It was a necessary conceit to get things started.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once I read the first, I kept wanting more so you'll want to read the second right away. This book was very interesting!
B00009W0U4|1.0|This \\"Film\\" is a waste of talent, time and space.<br /><br />The beginning has a scene that is so graphic and disturbing and goes on WAYYYYYY too long. NOBODY NEEDS TO SEE THAT. As Americans we are used to \\"Hollywood\\" violence and we know it's fake and we are desensitized to it. This scene can literally give (even an adult) jarring nightmares for a very long time. Someone should have edited that but thought \\"Hey, wouldn't it be totally gross if we left it in?\\" Whoever made THAT decision should never be allowed near a camera again. That's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />The beautiful Monica what can I say about her....OH, bad career choice. It's too bad cause she was hot in the only watchable 5-6 minute scene.<br />Clearly the director has some sort of \\"Rape\\" fetish and that's ok because you know the rape is not real. This scene was sooooo unrealistic in the sense that it would not have gone on as long as it did. How do I know? As a rape victim. He would have been in and out and gone. That was just ridiculous. I get where he was going artistically but seriously this was more over the top than ANY Schwarzenegger movie.<br /><br />Please save your hard earned money and read the \\"Real\\" reviews on this they speak the truth.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book...was very sad when it was over. The books always leave you wanting more but I was very pleased how she ended the series. Would definetly recommend reading it.
B0054YIQK8|5.0|The opera was great in many ways. It was eaarthy in its having, Carmen as. A real slut..  Her own desires of wanting some. One in her life was the driving force for her. While Jose wanted Carmen above all. His all all consuming dread was none but him was to love Carmen. Even if it ment death.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I had some concerns when I started evading because it was not the usual Ken Follett story line. I like spy and detective thrillers. Surprisingly I found my self very quickly drawn to the story. Follett continues to show his superb writing and excellent story telling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of my favorite books!!! definitely worth buying and reading. Much better than the movie. Hard to put down once you have started
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been playing Free Cell for several years now and I am really enjoying this card game, even more than I thought I would.<br />Randy
B0086DBE62|4.0|I loved this movie. It was funny and action packed. I loved the twists on the fairy tale. The ending was perfect. I think this is one of Julia Roberts better movies.
B000TERFGO|5.0|I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Coltrane's music, as expected you will not disappointed. This is one of his finest works, love the album!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this movie. I expected more comedy and a happier story. It focused instead on relationships and some issues of growing older. As one who is growing older I would have preferred a lighter look at growing older and more laughs. Lord knows us older people know the downnside of growing older. Give me something to laugh about before I go toes up.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read. Plenty of twists & turns. All those what if's. Having lived during that period Stephen really did his research & mentioned all those products we used to use--nostalgic memories<br />Carol B
B004IPPINW|4.0|I liked the provocative concept and was never sure who was sitting across from me at that table in the restaurant: the fundamentalist or potential assassin. I found it to be a thought-provoking book that made me think about what people in the rest of the world would think about people in North America...
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. Can be a pain to wait 3 minutes for energy to replenish and can get boring after awhile. There are always missions to accompish however.
B007STBUIW|5.0|They did an awesome job restoring this film! It's so good it's even better than some blurays today! Love the movie an absolute classic done the right way!
B000TU16GS|4.0|look, im not saying alex rider sucks, but it isnt legit writing. when i first read this book (back in 2008) i thought it  was a great book an it is but now after reading james bond, i realized a lot of the material was exactly the same as a james bond novel! after that i just wasnt sure. but not all his books are like this. try the diamond brothers series, he shows plenty of imagination there. just think, if alex rider was more imaginative, how much better could it be?
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is a lot of fun I like how easy it is to play anywhere anytime just wish the coins would come back faster
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I recommend watching the first Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) movie, to become more familiar with the characters.<br />And once again, not a deerstalker cap or clay pipe in site!;-) I really liked both movies.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|As part of a laptop movable arm this product met expectations for price, quality of materials and completeness of assemble instructions.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This album is so good. When I get up at 4 am for work. This is some of the music being played.
B007THA4FI|4.0|If the vast amounts of outrage in the reviews on Amazon are any indication, this book was not what people expected next from HRH JKR. Its only elements in common with the Harry Potter books are teenager protagonists and a British setting. Despite many warnings and careful marketing of the book to an adult audience, cries of vulgarity appeared almost immediately.<br /><br />I could review this book from several angles: the die-hard HP fandom perspective, where I'm angry it wasn't about Harry and the gang; the lit-crit viewpoint that loves unhappy endings and four-letter words; the JKR-hater who thinks she's a hack who should enjoy her pile of pounds in peace and never write again; and a thousand variations on those themes.<br /><br />Personally? I liked this book. It wasn't a fun book, but it wasn't meant to be a lovely romp through a meadow. Even in the most dire of situations, JKR's wit and clever descriptions shone. A large cast of characters and chapters from many POV made it a bit challenging to follow, especially when names were similar, but it wasn't a Russian drama.<br /><br />It's a solid follow-up to a series so beloved that any new work by the author would invite very intense scrutiny and the worst of magic-themed puns. I don't think a 7-book series set in Pagford is in order, but I'm still looking forward to whatever JKR writes next.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|this show is well written, very well directed and acted. The actors are exactly right for the part they play.The violence and profanity  seem necessary to tell the story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun and addicting, its like a arcade with unlimited tokens. a fun game for all ages to,I recommend this game to everyone.
0316228532|1.0|A better title for this book would be The Jerks.  If you want to read 500 pages of selfish, boring characters without one redeeming quality then this is the book for you. I had to will myself to finish it, should not have bothered.
B008AX18Y6|4.0|This is one of the most famous literary stories of recent years told by the man at its heart.  It's a book both funny and heart-rending at different times, and, like all good memoirs, reveals a little more of the author than perhaps intended.  A star deducted for incessant name-dropping that sometimes distracts.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Yet another book on WW2, but Follet continues his excellent work and gives a dramatic but (as far as i can judge a) historic correct picture seen through the interwoven fate of the involved characters. Some of the incidents are a bit roughly penciled out, but I assume this is to keep the amount of text down to a manageable size. It is a real page-turner that it is hard to put aside and have kept me awake late at night despite I know that I'll need to get up early in the morning... I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|If you are a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books and have read some of them you will, of course, want to add this to the list.  If you have never read a Jack Reacher novel don't start with this one.  You really need to have some history with Reacher in order to accept the character in this book.  Most Reacher books are exciting, clever, and filled with violence in the course of bringing bad guys to justice, (or eliminating them altogether,) in the process of certain vengeance for victims.  This is not the best Jack Reacher book but is still a decent read. Having read most of the previous Reacher books, I found this one somewhat slow.  I grew impatient waiting for Reacher to deliver his brand of setting things right.  I became confused sorting out the bad guys and their affiliations. To finalize, No Reacher book is a bad read, but this one is not on the top of the heap.
B005EI86JU|3.0|The book covers in detail every feature of the camera but it does it in a similar way as a manual. I expected to have a more pratical view. The reason why most manuals are not read is because they are though and boring. Anyway if you need more in depth detail of the camera you have the information there.
B00138J1XK|5.0|If you like Kansas, then this is the one for you. There are several good Kansas Cd 's out there. But none like this.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game was very well made and has good controlls, yes, it does copy minecraft, but i honestly couldnt care less. What matters in a game is the content, not whether or not it copied another game! i like how in this game it is more based on fighting than building, and what i like about minecraft is that there is more  building than fighting. These two games are great because when i get bored of one, i switch!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Still trying to figure it out.  Nice photos, fun to navigate for visual people.  Like the food shots and used it for a few cooking ideas. Tough for me to understand long-term value. I'll give it a little more time then decide if the app is worth keeping.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|Alright, for the first thirty or so levels the game is great. It is very addicting, however there is virtualy no strategy. In fact, it seams to me that the only good strategy to the game is to spend excesssive money on it. Anyways, like all glu games, they make a free game, but continuously tempt you to spend money on it. Honestly, i would rather have bought this game for two bucks and get rid of the in game buying glu credits. Once i got to level 36, which took around two and a half hours of play time, this game became impossible to continue without spending money, thus i deleted it.
B004XISI4A|4.0|this series of stories are exceptional and each chapter the start of a new adventure all the characters are in them selves very interesting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was a great read and although I was skeptical at first I am glad I purchased the series and am looking forward to more from this author.

The protagonist, Diana, is a mostly unpracticing witch and Professor of Alchemy who happens upon a rare and mysterious book, Ashmole 782, while doing research in Oxford. A mix of menacing and protective demons, witches and vampires ( being a creature is roughly as common in the book as being left handed is the real world) start following her and this turns menacing after the book's mysterious disappearnce. The enigmatic vampire Matthew takes her to his castle in France for protection. There the two fall in love and marry. It turns out that this is forbidden by The Congegation, a commitee of elite creatures that make the rules designed to keep creatures safe in a world dominated by humans, and the stakes rise exponentially.  There efforts to stay safe make for page turning reading. The ending , where they devise a way to avoid danger and find the missing book, sets up the premise for the next book in the trilogy, \\"Shadow of Night.\\" I couldn't wait to get the second book as soon as I finished the first.

B0098VXE50|5.0|This movie was excellent from start to finish.  The main people were a pleasure to watch and I thought that they stop makimg movies like this but I was wrong.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|before this book came out, i thought it was gonna be terrible. im glad i was proven wrong. i only have one critizise thinggy.<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />the end of the book did not work with me. i know the whole Â«well be together foreverÂ» stuff was supposed to be romantic. but there is a fine line between romance and stupid. that line was crossed! i was a total nerd for the percy jackson series. i still love it! but i feel like this series is more surrounding  romanc than epic quests. and where is grover!? did he tragicly die with out us being informed? that is a NO NO!!! i think Leo has become the best character because he has no love story behind him! (team Leo!)<br /><br />i also felt really bad for Nico. I thimk Rick has abused this kid too much. make him happy for once!<br /><br />overall, i feel this was a good book with some obvious flaws. i hope the next book is better.
B00846REIS|5.0|First of all I am a huge Fifty Shades fan! I've read several books since finishing the Fifty trilogy, and no book has captured me the way they did until I read Bared to You! In my honest opinion, it & Reflected in You are way way far better than the Fifty Shades Trilogy! I can't even believe it myself! I cannot hardly wait until the next book is released! My heart was totally into this book! It was happy, sad, furious, hurt, & not to mention hot & sexy! Absolutely love love love it! Must read series for sure!!
0062068415|5.0|One of my favorite books. Great suspense, plot twists, a dark and riveting story. Lehane is one of the best that's out there right now.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of the better novels published in 2012.  Love him or not, King has produced one of his finest pieces of work. Loved how he linked this story with that of \\"It\\".  This is a great read.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this latest Lee Child book.  For me, it lacked in the action department and it justed didn't feel like a Jack Reacher book.  I kept waiting for the part that really hooked me, but it never really came.  It wasn't bad, but after waiting soo long between books, you just hope for one that you don't want to put down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read this book to just see what all the hype was about and ended up reading all three within 4 days.
B0098VXE50|5.0|A very interesting adaptation of the Disney told story of years ago!  Excellent special effects, actors were very good in their rolls, I'd watch it again!<br />Blu-Ray & DVD arrived on time as ordered, price was fair.  I did not know much of this production prior to actually seeing the story unfold, it held my attention.

This is a very effective tool to make sure each team member is assigned responsibilities that are challenging and rewarding while improving our overall team effectiveness.

My objective is to help my sons understand their personal strengths better and make informed education and career decisions utilizing this data as part of their decision making process.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love that it leads me to other site I would have never known about!! Great resource for anything I want to try!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|It is worth a watch for all of the artwork; the costumes and the sci-fi effects are fun. However, the plot is sadly lacking any creativity and the some of the acting is flat.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The Hunger Games offered an effective mix of a post-apocalyptic, segregated society with an elite political class ruling at whim, and how the victims of this new world order  coped under the oppression.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  The author is extremely talented.  True, there are a few grammar errors but easily excusable.  Highly recommend this read if you enjoy a great story and lots of twists and turns.  I wasn't expecting much when I first started reading and already had another book in mind but thought I'd read the first 100 pages then decide if I wanted to continue.  After the 100 pages, I was hooked. I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say this is well worth the price and much more!  I love bargains like this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love this app! it really is great. I give it 4.5 stars Cu's it crashes from time to time.

B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Listen every 15-25 years a great female vocalist appears in the rock world, one that defines what the music is all about without losing what is great in the sound.  Janis held the title until Lita Ford took it and ran long and hard with it.  Unfortunate and fortunately the Rock Queen has been replaced there is not a new queen but a Goddess on the mic and that is Lzzy Hale.  The front woman for Halestorm could sing twinkle twinkle little star and we would eat it up...... Luckily she doesn't instead she belts out strong lyrics of sexual dominance, love, hate and all the things we have come to associate with Rock-N-Roll.  Lzzys latest is no different.  If you really want to be entertained Buy it NOW!!!!!

B008FTAAG2|5.0|Blood the latest release from in this moment continues where the dream left off Maria has the voice of an angel and in the blink of an eye she can pull your tortured soul into the depths of hell.  Her vocal range and control are amazing.  She can growl with the best of them in the business (including the men) and in a heartbeat return to the beautiful sirens voice that will lure you to your doom.  If you ever get the opportunity to see her live I suggest you do, I went all the way to DIRTFEST in Michigan to see her,  If you can't see her live buy Blood!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have to admit the first 7 Chapters 'Fifty Shades of Grey' were extremely slow, I thought about putting it down several times, but my curiousity had gotten the better of me. Nonetheless, the thrills, chills and the erotic adventures the left me speechless. I found myself, continually reading and waiting for the next adventure or turn.<br /><br />I am reading, 'Fifty Shades Freed' and I am really enjoying it. I must admit, I am saddened the trilogy is about to end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is amazing! It keeps me playing all day. I'm telling you. Get it. You won't regret! Love it!!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie. My heart was pounding and I was on the edge of my seat by the end of the movie. The relationship between the daughter and father was believable. The action was fast paced and kept you guessing. It also draws attention to the world of kidnapping for the sex trade. I would watch it again.

B009B50QOU|5.0|I'm a old school fan of Green Day, NoFX, Pennywise, Offspring and so on. I wanted to say that because to all of us that grew up listening to those great bands - we - in general - feel that particularly Green Day - being one of the great bands of punk back in the day, is the one that has changed the most in the last few years.<br /><br />They went through their EMO / Twilight stage which pained me to see more than death in the family.<br /><br />And they came out with American Idiot and 21st century which for all 10 year old kids are great albums. I know that critically, those albums did great too, so please don't remind me of that, since I think music critics are 10 year old kids. But in the end, Green Day changed to something new - and well if you are an old fan there is still nothing like Kerplunk, Dookie, and Insomniac - and I thought I would not even try another Green Day album again.<br /><br />But last week, a friend told me to check out Green Day at iheartradio. I mean I LOVED THAT SHOW. It reminded me of the old times. Billie Joe showed what is to be a rock star. I don't care for all the critics, that has been one of the greatest rock shows ever and Billie Joe should continue on the drinks and drugs. After all, if you don't know why green day is called green day - please do some research. So then I said, lets try this new album.<br /><br /> And I have to give a 5 star rating only because I don't dislike the album, which is a lot to say given the last 10 years of the band. Its a relatively good album, with some elements from the old stuff. If I'm going to say something I don't like its the voice tech/ sound. They changed Billie Joe's voice in a bad way. Other than that, I would have liked to hear a song like Basket Case (we know that old classic), but I mean technically like basket case, fast palm muting guitars like most old punk. But Green Day and Billie Joe, great job I hope you continue on this trend.

0812993292|4.0|\\"the unlikely pilgrimage of harold fry\\" demonstrates how one needn't become mired in and defined by past mistakes. we all possess the ability to change the course of our lives- at least that's the premise. Harold is Everyman. He has made his share of mistakes and has pocketfuls of regrets. then, miraculously, he is moved to reinvent his life. nothing like sitting in a chair for 6 straight months to point up the meaninglessness that life can become. he is an empty vessel.<br />  The prose are delicious. When reading this book, it is necessary to share harold's journey, one step at a time. the evocative images spur the reader on, as harold's new-found perspecacity encourages him. Sometimes, it is the journey that matters- not a particularly original thought but one worth being reminded of now and again. Undertaking a journey can be as simple as taking that first step.

B000CNGCOI|5.0|The video/documentary was as it was described by other Pink Floyd's fans. Definetely it would have been  much better, the eerie look of Pompeii, instead of displaying in some of the songs the background of the planets, but regardless when you are die hard fan you really appreciate and enjoy every minute of it. I blasted on my Bose system, lights out, an incredible experience!
B008J34466|5.0|P!nk might just be one of the best pop songwriters out there and, paired with her electric and haunting vocals, this album is a huge success from start to finish.  To date, this album is by far her most fun, most heart-felt, and most accessible.  There's a real story told about love, heartbreak, strength and fear.  HIGHLY recommend.
0307959856|4.0|If you have already read Jane Austen's novels, this mystery is a delight.  The writing is excellent, as usual, and you will enjoy her description and vocabulary.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a nice follow up to the series and I was left with a smile on my face. I want to read so I could discuss with my children who as it turned out were far less interested than I. All in all a good read.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Don't take it seriously and the movie is entertaining.  It is playing off of an unsubstantiated claim that a secret Nazi saucer actually did travel to the moon before the Nazi regime was conquered.  The acting is based on off-balanced characters and they do a good job.  The story is an interesting line of action and bawdy humor.  Enjoy it.

B008EZVNO0|3.0|First of all, the 3 stars are related to the place this new album deserves in the magnum opus that is Van's incredible discography. In my mind I usually divude his albums in 3 rough categories: masterpieces, very good albums and good albums (of course there is no such thing as a bad or even average Van Morrison's album) and this one belongs in the third category. In another way I roughly divide his albums into other 3 sub-categories: the ones that discend from Astral Weeks (e.g.: Veedon Fleece and Common One), the ones that descend from Moondance (e.g.: Street Choir and Wavelength) and the ones that merge the influence of those two untouchable albums (had he only consigned to posteriry those two, I'd still reckon him among my strict favourite singers), examples of which are probably larger than the other two. In this instance this album falls into the third category again, borrowing the sustained atmosphere typical of Astral Weeks (tracks blending into one another, the aural balm of the music possessing a sort of neverending quality) with the black music infuence that informs so much Moondance. The only \\"problem\\" is that The Man is 67 and you realise, if nothing else, from the sometimes excessive softeness of the music and, by contrast, the old-age bile of most of the lyrics (what a pity that for the first time he should write \\"political\\", I always liked him for not doing it!). But put that aside and compare his output with anything coming out these days and he still shines as a unique talent, an extraodinary singer, a valiant songwriter and an ever searching musician. Yes, because even though basically his last really \\"creative\\" albums where the \\"mystyc ones\\" (Beautiful Vision and Inarticulate), this wonderful musician has never failed to add that little bit of novelty in each album he has cut, minor novelties of course, but still delightful and much appreciated. This time, for instance, he has used prominently for the first time the trombone in the brass arrangements, let's say in place of the trumpet, evidently he really wanted that smooth-jazz tone that the album has and that, as I said, it is sometimes a bit \\"too\\" smooth for my Van Morrison's taste. You even get the first ever bass solo (unless you count the extraordinary work of David Hayes on Snow in San Anselmo as a solo) and the most heartfelt John Lee Hooker tribute since he died (musical tribure, that is). Another thing I do with a new Van's album is compare it with its predecessor, this time 4 years have passed since Keep it simple and I must say i disagree with some comments, I really liked the album, it surely was more varied (the novelty was the ukulele) and it ended just perfectly, wherein this new one ends with a throwaway track that partially ruins the magic atmosphere of the previous 2 tracks, the masterpiece of the album (If in money we trust) and the John Lee Hooker tribute (Pagan heart); but of course you can program the CD...all in all, a more than welcome return (I was fearing he'd devoted to live concerts only), a worthy addition to his impressive canon and a very good late evening listen, just don't let's talk about \\"return to form\\" or other silly things like that: he's never lost his form, he just do what he damn pleases when he likes to cut an album.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|I watched this movie and it is very good.  If you like these sorts of movies(or Kristin Stewart or Charlize Theron) both ladies are very good in their roles.  Unfortunately the streaming wasn't that great.  It seemed to pixelate a lot.  Especially in the wider or action filled scenes.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is a reading favorite of mine and I eagerly await each new book. A Wanted Man was not a disappointment.
1451662432|5.0|I bought this book because I am an aspiring bodybuilder and there has never been one as great as Arnold. I have read many of his books and I always read them over and over. Total Recall is a great book for many reasons. Arnold is very honest throughout the book admitting when he made mistakes and when he did things that he regrets. He goes into great detail about parts of his life that few people probably know and I really appreciate that. Every part of the book was interesting and I really enjoyed all the stories. Arnold was someone with a lot of personality so his stories are always fun to read.<br /><br />There are many things that he did in his life that I would not agree with. I don't agree with all his choices as governor or as an actor and there were times when I read this book that I really said, \\"Wow, what was he thinking.\\" This doesn't change my opinion of the book though. It is incredible to see how far he has come in life. From being born as a poor Austrian to being one of the most famous people in America is incredible. It is incredibly motivational to see how someone can have big dreams and realize them through dedication and hard work. We all make mistakes in life. If people knew some of the mistakes I've made, they would hate me too. Don't hate this book based on the mistakes he's made, but instead read it to see all the things that he's done right.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't like this game because to me it is pointless and makes you lose interest in such a short amount of time. Second of all its the same thing over and over again, level after level. :(

B008N1V11U|4.0|I am a bit of geek when it comes to batman he is by far my favorite superhero. So when I went researching about a Dark knight rises video game and found out about this app I was very exited. The graphics and game play with this app are spectacular. My favorite thing about this game is you get to drive the bat pod and the bat its really awesome since you cant do that in any other batman game of this century<br />except the batman begins game back in 2005 which you can drive the batmobile at a certain part in the game. This game has some good fighting Batman himself can punch, kick, use his grapnel gun, jump, glide and drive the vehicles. A fun game although, it takes up a lot of memory space. Enjoy the open world dark knight rises experience!
B0098VXE50|3.0|This movie was good...despite Kristin Stewerts horrible acting. Not sure how this girl keeps getting such good lovie roles. Shes got one look...the 'who farted' face and thats it.  Charlece Theron was awesome and the movie was dark and entertaining.  Not appropriate for kids.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Such an emotional roller coaster!! So many ups and downs for Gideon and Eva! So many things happened in such a short period of time. Eva and Gideon have a difficult relationship to say the least and things are far from easy. Their need for one another is scary at times - they are addicted to each other. Gideon is the typical alpha male- dominant and possessive. I'm glad we got to know more about Gideon's past and his issues. Can I just say Brett Kline was hot!! It was nice to see he saw his relationship with Eva totally different than what she saw it for. Cary is a great character I totally love him (his humor and his love for Eva). Now the waiting for the next book begins! Can't wait!!

B00722T2AI|5.0|This long seller, more than one million copies sold from 1981, can be considered a true \\"milestone\\" of marketing and communication.<br /><br />This book  was the first written by Al Ries and Jack Trout (among their other works \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\" and \\"Marketing Warfare\\"), who worked together for over 25 years as partners in a consulting and advertising company .<br /><br />Jack Trout firstly introduced the concept of \\"positioning\\" in the June 1969 issue of \\"Industrial Marketing\\".<br /><br />The Authors describe positioning as the (only) way to transfer, successfully, your message as a company, a politician or a professional to the \\"market\\": developing and managing a system that allows the creation of a \\"place\\" in the mind of the Customer.<br /><br />This \\"easy to read\\" book identifies the best practices, whether you are a leader or a follower, to (re)position yourself at the expense of competitors, defining the best name for your product while avoiding the \\"line extension\\" trap\\".<br /><br />In about 200 pages, the authors provide a basis to better communicate your message thus making it \\"unique\\" to the Customer.
B008G12ERC|4.0|The 2nd Law is one of Muse's most thematically coherent albums, it is one of their most emotionally intense albums, and musically it blows their last release out of the water. I came away from this one thinking, \\"Yes, Muse is back.\\" At the same time, there is no question that the intensity of this album sets it apart from their previous work. Yes, they have made emotionally intense albums in the past, but it always felt very teenaged-even if you couldn't recognize it as such at the time-with their reckless thrashing, Bellamy's screaming guitar, and his lashing out at former lovers and politicians. I loved all of that, and I still do. But The 2nd Law is intense in a less loud way, a style that builds toward a sort of quiet terror and a loud regret. Point-blank, I am telling you that Muse has grown up, and that their maturing is a good thing because it has allowed them to achieve a new terrace of meaning in their music. If their first four albums starting with Showbiz and ending with Black Holes were the voice given to the angst and frustration experienced by teenagers during the rapid globalization of the late 1990s and the War on Terror, then The 2nd Law is the sound of a bitter pill as that generation enters the real world and realizes that the promises of a better, fairer society were replaced by a system that is at times terrifying, often unfair, and psychologically taxing.<br /><br />That's the sense in which The 2nd Law is a vigorous critique of modern society. Regardless of my opinion on Bellamy's politics, each track is masterfully crafted such that the lyrics and the music come together to suggest that the human race is barreling down an unsustainable path that will end in the painful unraveling of civilization. From the first track, Bellamy rails against greed, selfishness, and callous egocentrism. The high-powered opener, Supremacy, opens with an attention-grabbing bass pattern which brings to mind cinematic images of battlefields full of tanks, then builds to a crescendo accompanied by screaming violins, and then suddenly the whole thing flatlines-sound gone. In its place we find a soft ballad in which Bellamy sings to a force or entity that \\"[brainwashes] our children to be mean,\\" telling this thing \\"You don't have long / I am on to you / The time has come to destroy / Your Supremacy.\\" It is classic Muse. (Unsurprisingly, it has already been featured in a James Bond: Skyfall commercial.)<br /><br />You've probably already heard the second track, Madness, on the radio. In it, Bellamy takes the position of a lover who has come out of a sort of normalized insanity,  \\"I have finally seen the light / [...] /And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had / Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah.\\" This song plays a lot like a rock lullabye, reminiscent in some ways of tracks on Pink Floyd's Division Bell. It's a beautiful song, and it's one of the first times where Bellamy talks about a personal transformation, about being sucked into the world in a kind of madness that alienates people from themselves but also from others to whom they are close. Is it his transformation, or some character that he has created for the purpose of the album? I don't know, and I don't think it entirely matters, though based on the emotional intensity of the album I can't imagine him expressing this unless it is his own feelings.<br /><br />It's not all down-beat though. The third track, Panic Station, is a high-energy, upbeat call for you to realize your own power. Matt's vocals climb up, his guitar riffs rise to a crescendo, and in the clouds he engages in a duet with a set of trumpets. It's over the top and yet it's not because it is perfectly constructed. Similarly, the follow-up track, Survival, is all about exercising your power to win. This song is high-energy, high-intensity, and has an incredible build-up. More and more layers are piled on, from the bass to an all male choir to a female soprano choir supporting Bellamy's vocals until it finally explodes into a guitar solo that reaches shrill highs. Ultimately Bellamy's vocals smash through this guitar solo to bring you back into the thick of a race taking place on the ground. No wonder it was  the official song of the London Olympics.<br /><br />From there, the album takes a turn toward the darker. The track Follow Me is an anthem for the broken-hearted and world-weary, contrasting a beatless synthesized dark place with Dom's energetic drumming and Matt's bright vocals. The song falls into a dub-step like place full of tension until the tension is released and the song propels forward again. Despite this track's call not to despair, our hero cannot help but become quagmired in bitterness in the next track, where Bellamy speaks directly to a callous corporate titan, criticizing his power. \\"You're out of control / [...] / When you... / bend the rules / buy yourself an island.\\" Ultimately, though the song begins with bitter contemplation, it builds into a furious, confused guitar solo that ends with an instruction for his antagonist: \\"Kill yourself / come on and do us all a favor.\\" At this point the music ends and all you can hear is the sound of rioting, no doubt influenced by last year's events in London.<br /><br />The track Explorers is a down-tempo lamentation that features bassist Chris Wolstenholme begging an unknown listener to comfort him. \\"Free me / free me / free me from this world / we don't belong here/ it was a mistake imprisoning our souls / can you free me / free me from this world?\\" This track is a huge departure from Muse's previous work. Where in the past Bellamy's lyrics always urged listeners to fight back against an unjust world, as in the track Invincible from Black Holes and Revelations, the speaker in Explorers has admitted defeat to an economic and political order that is stacked against him. I wonder how many twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings feel like Bellamy's speaker could be them, in the midst of record unemployment, increasing natural disasters, and an eroding environment? When I say that Muse is growing up with their audience, this is what I mean. Muse never could have made this song five years ago, but I think many of Muse's listeners never could have identified with it five years ago, either.<br /><br />The track Liquid State is the beginning of the album's climactic finish. In a rare twist, bassist Chris Wolstenholme provides lead vocals. It comes as a shock at first to hear Wolstenholme's deeper vocals, but for this track he is perfect. With a quick tempo, heavy bass, and menacing guitar riffs, this track depicts the frustration and desperation an anybody who is beaten, downtrodden, and afraid to hope. It ends with the plea, \\"Help me to survive.\\"<br /><br />As Liquid State dies in a quick flush, the first of two ending tracks begin. Titled The 2nd Law: Unsustainable, this piece features quick, intense orchestral strings backed by a choir heralding the doom of civilization. There are no lyrics, but there do not need to be, because the emotions that the song elicits from the listener convey what the band wants to say better than words ever could. After the choir fades away, the text of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is read aloud by a quick-lipped british speaker, the last word of which is \\"Unsustainable.\\" With this one word, the entire album comes together, the bass drops, and the song falls into a dubstep with orchestral strings in the back like we have not heard before. Bellami is heard wailing in the background, after which the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics repeats again, the bass drops, and the song abruptly ends, ushering in the final track.<br /><br />The final track, titled \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\" has pensive piano notes that feel like falling rain, a muted bass drum kick in the background, and a regretful and beautiful violin solo. Random radio and television transmissions are overlaid on the track, presenting the listener with the notion that society is at or near the point of collapse. The driving bass drum fills the track with a feeling of inevitability, and the pensive piano keeps the listener anxious while the chorus and the violin eulogize the collapse of society. It is a beautiful, sad track, full of quiet trauma as the chaos and dispersion mandated on the molecular level by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics results in the unwinding of the civilization that humankind has built up. I don't know whether Bellamy is correct that our way of living in this world is unsustainable (I certainly hope that he is not), but I do know that this track is like a rhetorical device that causes the listener to feel, emotionally speaking, as if it were true. It leaves the listener with a feeling of deep regret and sadness, and it fades out, leaving you alone.<br /><br />The 2nd Law is a rare album that has enough meaning and content to fill a novel (or perhaps a screenplay). After it finished, I had to sit and contemplate what I just heard, and why it made me feel like it did. The album's journey is one that many young listeners may be facing now, or may soon face. It brings the listener from the moment of realization that there is something terribly wrong with the world, to the determination to fix it, through the loss of focus due to personal adversity, to hopefulness, and then silent emotional collapse and self-estrangement, bitterness and anger, defeat, and then a \\"liquid state\\", something that is neither hopelessness and hopefulness, life nor death. Finally, there is a sense of regretful detachment as we listen to civilization unravel.
0307341550|2.0|Fortunately, Gillian Flynn's efforts improved after this one. I'm glad I read the other two before this book or I never would have read more of her work.  Apart from the unlikable characters, stereotyped \\"Southern town,\\" and improbable plot that others have well-described, I was disturbed by a couple other things. One was the continual descriptions of drinking and vomiting and the repeated assertions that the character drinks to create a layer between herself and reality - hellooooo? is this something new?? do the readers need to be told this over and over? The other was the many descriptions of the 13-year old girl's breasts.  This really felt like reading kiddie porn, especially after hearing it about 10 times, and made me concerned about Ms. Flynn (and her editors).
B008N4XC2I|4.0|The 2nd Law is one of Muse's most thematically coherent albums, it is one of their most emotionally intense albums, and musically it blows their last release out of the water. I came away from this one thinking, \\"Yes, Muse is back.\\" At the same time, there is no question that the intensity of this album sets it apart from their previous work. Yes, they have made emotionally intense albums in the past, but it always felt very teenaged-even if you couldn't recognize it as such at the time-with their reckless thrashing, Bellamy's screaming guitar, and his lashing out at former lovers and politicians. I loved all of that, and I still do. But The 2nd Law is intense in a less loud way, a style that builds toward a sort of quiet terror and a loud regret.

0385344333|3.0|I have read all the Reacher books. I read this one by audio. I got what I expected. Long descriptions of mundane items. An end to the story never anticipated at rhe beginning. A beginning for the next story at the end of this one. All in all I enjoyed the audio.<br /><br />I am getting concerned that Lee Child may be tapping out ala Patricia Cornwall. They do great first books then get a formula and mail it it in. The next book will be interesting to see. I quit Cornwall about three bad books ago when I could not even finish the book.<br /><br />PS. Tom Cruise as Reacher? Laughable.
0887307280|5.0|I have owned and operated my own small business, I bought this book as a resource for my position in business management consulting. Mr. Gerber's talent in understanding the motivational aspects and physiological make-up of the typical small business owner and the clear, concise way in which he presents it in this prose has been a great benefit to me. I highly recommend this book to anyone thinking of starting a new business, already running a business, just curious in entrepreneurship.

This app keeps them in place and helps ensure they don't get to non-kid apps or utilities or purchase things through general button smashing.
B0098WWEH8|5.0|This is a great album. Like their last album, the incredible Veckatimest, this one is great from start to finish. Another great one from one of the best indie bands around.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If only Lee Childs could somehow write new tales about Jack Reacher as fast as I can consume them!  A Wanted Man continues this spellbinding and nomadic character - obliging my high expectations with the compelling mix of action, plot twists, and the \\"knight errant\\" theme which hooked me from the beginning.  Bravo and thank you Mr. Childs.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book was poorly written and the characters were not likeable. It's supposed to be a romance novel, but that was also poorly done--no details and no romance. I deleted it off my kindle because I was so disappointed
159315724X|5.0|In the book, The Compound Effect, Hardy aggregates some of life's best lessons to remind us that the journey is taking steps that compound on each other. It's an easy read with stories and messages that you can apply right now in your own life.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books since The Killing Floor, and I enjoyed this book too. Lee Child's prose is still action geared and his hero is still the same calculating, rootless, merciless enemy. The plot confined Reacher to less bone crunching action, but the threat of it was always hovering in the background. If you want more gore, read a forensic thriller; if you want more reflection read Le Carre; and if you want more atmosphere, read Mankell. I remain a firm Reacher fan. Thanks for another entertaining read, Mr Child.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|I am enjoying this game, played it a lot at a 2 day craft show.  My 2 craft neighbors<br />played a little bit also, we all liked the graphics and one woman said she was going to<br />get her very own Kindle Fire so that she could play this game.  I usually keep the<br />sound turned down on my Fire so I can't tell you how the sound is but Waldo is always<br />a fun guy to find.  Not only him but you start out in the age of the dinosaurs and you<br />get to find cave men, animals and all sorts of things.  Once you finish the cavemen<br />level you then time travel to the next spot in history and solve all of the riddles/levels<br />and of course Finding Waldos.

B008RV5K5E|2.0|Think: retiree Batman. But with mutants wearing visors, mohawks, and using...jive turkey slang? Don't get me wrong - Gordon, and Bruce are portrayed incredibly. Their old man dates with scotch, and war stories are extremely engaging character moments. But Peter Pan Robin, and the Cyberpunk thing is so cliché, and cheesy -- it takes me out of it. I haven't read the graphic, nor do I intend to after seeing this.
055357342X|5.0|Where do I even begin?  \\"Wow\\" doesn't even describe this book well enough.<br /><br />In the words of LOTR's King Theoden (in the films), so much death.  It's tough to get attached to a character in this series.  You'll never know if and when Mr. Martin will kill him/her next.  Just when you start to think, \\"Oh, s/he's an important character as this story goes on. I'm sure s/he's gonna stick around for a couple more books.\\"  Wrong.  And in this book, there are so many things you will not see coming.<br /><br />There are so many events going on at the same time.  I've held off posting a full review on this book because it is so complex.  Originally a trilogy stretched on to be a 7-book series because it is impossible to close all ties in three books.  It's deceit, backstabbing, family feuds, warmongering, romance, the supernatural, politics, ambition, life, death... everything in 1000+ pages!<br /><br />I don't think I can do a detailed review without spoiling any part of the book.  The events don't really overlap with each other.  A Storm of Swords is definitely heartbreaking in some parts.  Like the times when the Starks are almost reunited with each other.  It frustrated me but at the same time, it broke my heart.  Poor Sansa, forever a political pawn.  She dreams of fairytales and gets everything but that.  Arya's off to her own adventure with equally cool people.  Jon making his mark in the North.  So basically, Ned Stark's children are the Chosen Ones in this `verse.  Daenerys... I wasn't a fan of her chapters in this book.  I felt that it didn't contribute to the bigger picture.  I admire her ambition but right now, her efforts are rather laughable.  As for Catelyn, whatever I said about her chapters in the past, I take it all back.  What happens to her in this book is something that I am excited for in the next one.  I loved Bran's chapters because of his conversations with Meera and Jojen.  And Hodor.  HODOR!!!<br /><br />Once again, the POV chapters proved very helpful as a plot device.  Especially Jamie's.  I liked him so much in this.  To me, he went through the most change from the first book.  And I really felt sorry for the guy as the story progressed.<br /><br />I seriously cannot wait to see all this translated into film.  HBO, you better bring it!<br /><br />Rating: 5/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: Just read it.  Just read it.very helpful as a plot device.  Especially Jamie's.  I liked him so much in this.

0525953728|5.0|This is an incredible well written story on the mission that killed Bin Laden. At the end you wake up realizing that it was not a novel, but real history. This is a story of spies and commandos that dare into Pakistan to finish with an enemy of civilization well protected by it's military and succeeded.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I picked up the 3220 to replace a G630 in a recent build nothing wrong with the Pentium chip just that the 3220 is so much better at all task. IMO unless your into maxed out gaming quad cores are a waste of money for home use. I coupled the 3220 with a mid range video card and 4gb of memory couldn't be happier with the results with those components bought at sales I'm under the cost of a single good quality quad. The 2500 IG on the 3220 has gotten decent reviews so for high def. playback a video card is not needed. I use an external 3.0 USB HD, performance was not a step up but a leap forward with the 3220 compared to the 630. To top it off it uses ten watts less than the 630, a good value for a work horse of a processor.<br /><br />cons: The miserable excuse for a cooler Intel provides. I replaced it with an inexpensive 92mm aluminum after market unit it runs quiet and keeps the chip cool.

B008NNNF7G|5.0|I came across this album as an Amazon recommendation.  The price was right enough to gamble on, so I picked it up.  Turns out to be one of the best bands I had never heard of.  I ended up picking up the rest of their stuff soon after listening to this.  These boys know how to play.  A taste of Southern rock, with a bit of country and blues thrown into the mix. I just saw their show last night and they rocked the house.  I'm looking forward to seeing them open for Zac.  Time for them to get some big-time well deserved recognition.
0525953728|5.0|This is a must read.  While not the type of books I normally read, this was written in a very objective, descriptive manner.  You felt like you were right there.  I read it in two days.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good book, similar to 50 Shades of Grey.  I think the writing was much better. I can't wait to read the second book.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been a big Logitec fan for a while.  I tried the Plantronics headset first, though, because it has a better rating.  Big mistake.  I ended up returning that one because it wouldn't work with my system board's chipset. A friend of mine has the wired logitech headset and loves it, so I went for this one.  It installed easy and works great.  It uses the same software as my G13 gameboard. Lots of cool features and the surround sound is amazing.  The range is great.  I can walk down the kitchen with the headset on and still be talking to friends.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|First Sentence: Until she met the exploding statue, Annabeth thought she was prepared for anything.<br /><br />A Quick Synopsis: In the third book in the Heroes of Olympus series, all your favourite heroes are back and ready to fight. Percy and Annabeth are about to be reunited...but Camp Jupiter may be preparing for war. Not only that, but seven demigods must embark on a quest to close the Doors of Death as well as to follow the Mark of Athena. Can Romans and Greeks truly work together? Or will the growing tension between them be the end of them all?<br /><br />The Review: Rick Riordan books are so popular at my school that when the day of a new book release dawns, you'd think that a sudden public holiday had been declared. The hallways are full with kids showing their new book to their rightfully jealous friends. Those friends storm the school library placing a reserve on the aforementioned book. Even the teachers are aware of this hullabaloo. They smile when they hear the students discussing the book at lunch. Although I was not lucky enough to snatch a copy of the book on release day, I was able to grab a copy three days after its release. I, however, did not believe that it was worth all the hype. I know, I know, blasphemy, blasphemy, how could I say such a thing? Well, here's why.<br /><br />First of all, the book is the longest Riordan book by far, clocking in at nearly 600 pages. Normally, this is a cause for happiness and rejoicing. However, that's not the case here. The Mark of Athena takes an unusually long time in getting off the ground. I also felt that there was not enough action or suspense to keep the plot flowing. And here's the strangest part--I thought there was even filler parts in the book! Don't worry. I'm just as shocked as you are.<br /><br />Secondly, the humour. Riordan scored on an irresistible blend of humour, heart, and action in The Lightning Thief. But lately, it feels like that formula is being rehashed over and over again just so he can produce new books or--Heaven forbid--he can make his money. It's more of the same here, and when the only laugh-out-loud moment in a Riordan book, or any book, for that matter, is when Pokemon is referenced in passing, you know you've got a problem. Speaking of more of the same, I thought in general that this book was more of the same. In The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune, we were introduced to fascinating new characters and gods. In The Mark of Athena, there's really nothing new. Sure, there's the fact that the demigods end up in Rome in eventually, but the setting isn't that interesting or well-developed. I felt like it had a presence in the book for a few pages and then just disappeared.<br /><br />Lastly, the ending. I am sure that I am not alone when I say that the ending of the book is truly a killer ending! It is a cliffhanger...too much of a cliffhanger. I felt like the book ended just when the climax was beginning. That isn't a good sign. It was too abrupt, and there was only one chapter following it that seemed to be gearing us up for the next book. On the bright side, though, Riordan's characters are still as lovable as ever, and you will continue to care for them in this volume.<br /><br />Now, I'm certainly not trying to say that this is the end of the world for Rick Riordan. With ten books for kids already out, it was only inevitable that he would falter eventually. While The Mark of Athena wasn't as great as its predecessors, it is a worthy addition to the series. And a standard Riordan book is better than the majority of Young Adult stuff out there. Most importantly, did it make me want to keep reading the series? You betcha. I'll still be on the Olympus rollercoaster when The House of Hades launches next year, and while my enthusiasm may be slightly diminished, I can't wait!<br /><br />Memorable Quote: The Prophecy of Seven was unfolding at last. No more waiting for Leo to finish the ship. No more easy days at Camp Half-Blood, pretending thefuture was still a long way off. They were under way. with a bunch of angry Romans behind them and the ancient lands ahead. The giants would be waiting. Gaea was rising. And unless they succeeded in this quest, the world would be destroyed.future was still a long way off. They were under way. with a bunch of angry Romans behind them and the ancient lands ahead. The giants would be waiting. Gaea was rising. And unless they succeeded in this quest, the world would be destroyed.
B000JML90Y|5.0|While Mr Darwin is to be commended for his efforts, I must take issue with this book. For one, the writing style is old and outdated. It sounds like a Victorian era period romance in parts. He ignores many of the modern advances in science. I fail to see how you can write a book on evolution these days without mentioning DNA even once. From the lack of general science aptitude and his outdated views, it almost appears like he was home schooled. A for effort but D- for execution. Take Bio 101 and try again in a few years.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I can't believe that people would give this novel less than 5 stars. I would like to know what people want? Personally I thought it was brilliant. I was engulfed by the story and use of language. Say no more.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Best book I've read In quite a while.  Reacher is such an intriguing character.  Lee Child really knows how to write and is one of my favorite authors.  I'm always looking for his next book.
B003X27L9U|5.0|Writing this novel from the perspective of a child was indeed very clever and unique. I enjoyed this as much as The Lovely Bones. She managed to create a world for the reader to actually walk inside. Eerie. The intro to the book is genius. \\"Today I'm five. I was four last night going to sleep in Wardrobe.\\" Brilliant. I held my breath so many times. I was almost glad when it finished, but then I began to read it again. A peculiar paradox of emotions it caused. Read it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thouroghly enjoyed reading this book.  It was very hard to put down once started.  The author gave you great insight into his life and the life of a SEAL.  It only increased my respect of the SEALS and all branches of the military.  Thanks for all who do and have served and protected us.
B0031R5K72|5.0|This novel griped me from the onset and then it delivered through out. For once a lengthy novel that didn't seem like a chore. Zusak is a writer that understands what the reader wants. There is nothing else to say other than buy it and read it. How can the opening line, \\"Here is a small fact, you are going to die\\" not make you want to read on. Honestly...You should read it. Here is another novel by a new writer that should be mentioned.(a debut) It was a very pleasant surprise recently. Well written, intriguing, but very different.[[ASIN:B009FUE1OW A Final Dance]] Remarkable writing.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a fun ap.  Not too easy or too hard...just nice relaxing game play.  Can't wait to play the new one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the action + details! can not wait to read book 2 ! The ending great and the food they eat in the cap sounds good.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|It's probably my second favorite Muse album. First is Absolution and now, The 2nd Law. Purely brilliant, breath-taking, musically stunning. There's really nothing else to be said about this band other than their music will always be top notch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The ability to customize the table and deck with your own photos is amazing. Also, the difficulty is just right for anyone who has played Windows solitaire.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a well written book that tells much more than the story behind the heros (thousands of support personnel and Seals) who successfully completed the mission against Osama Bin Laden. It also (semi-polically correctly) tells the story of an adminstration desperate for a \\"victory.\\"  An administration that will go to great lengths to look good...even expose sensitive, confidential and classified information. There was no NEW classified that was revieled in this book, only the truth about what happened on the mission. In world of Operations Security/classified information, the current administration already told the world all of the details; who, how and where.  Sit back and enjoy this book for what it is...the truth!  America should be deeply appreciative of the military and in particular the Special Forces.  These people are extraordinary and go well above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis.  Another important point about the author and this book, the majority of the money raised will go to military based charities.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest and have been pinning since it was in beta testing. This app is okay but I like the actual web site best. This is great to check pinterest but I go to the web site to pin new items.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Wasn't one of his best but was still good.  It was just more of the same and it didn't keep me on my toes.
1423140605|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus series. I really enjoyed the book and I got it in waaay earlier than the site said I would and I love that!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Good book thought it was a good way  to add some new characters and as always plan a  doomsday scenario rick alive got me buying your next book too
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I was curious about the first and found it badly written, sex was kind of boring, but the characters were engaging.  The second was just stupid and this one made me want to throw the kindle out the window it was so bad.  The writer was unimaginative-kept repeating the same things over and over. Dumb dumb dumb.
B0087HT36U|4.0|not too easy or too hard. works fine on kindle fire.  fun game. It is similar to other games out there though.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was well written and the pace was great.  Wasn't too heavy.  Good holiday read.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This interesting book is insightful and thoughtful. A little bit too text like in parts; however, the perspectives a very valuable in many shperes of life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Truly one of the best love stories I've read in a long time.  I was one of the last hold outs in our office to read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  I didn't think it was something that I would enjoy, and I read alot!  On a recent road trip with friends, I finally gave in, downloaded the first book to my kindle and could not put it down, read all three in a weeks time.  Yes, there is alot of sex, but the story of trust and unconditional love is woven magnificently.  For those of you who aren't sure about this book...think no more, the trilogy is a must read.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Jonah Hill made me laugh!  Channing Tatum was a perfect partner to Jonah's character.  Funny movie in a Hangover sense of way.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved everything about it ive read all of these books and they keep getting better the only downside is that i have to wait a whole year to read the next one!
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Movie had some surprises!  The scenery was awesome!  George Clooney played a great role and it was different from other roles he has played.
0316228532|1.0|This book is filled with petty, selfish, unpleasant people and their disgusting behavior. I'm an avid reader and certainly don't expect my novels to be nothing but sweetness and light, but this book is utterly unpleasant. It's a character-driven novel, but none of the characters are likeable or admirable in the least. This is not a story of good people fighting bad people; it's a story of disgusting, self-centered people interacting with other disgusting, self-centered people. The story jumps so rapidly from one character's POV to another's, I didn't feel invested in any of them; didn't know them; didn't care about them. I actually had to write notes to remember names -- who was whose son, wife, enemy, etc. There is very little plot; no causes or quests I cared about. It's filled with vulgarity in language, thought, and deed. I'd give it an NC-17 rating. I was ready to plow through the unpleasantness out of loyalty to Rowling, but realized around page 120 that, not only was I repulsed by these people, I was bored out of my mind. Rowling is a gifted writer, especially at describing people, personalities, and attitudes, but this novel is page after page of small, petty behaviors, not major actions that move the story forward. When one of the charcters started scratching his hairy navel, I decided I was done. I skipped and read the last two chapters, which were so depressing and pointless, I'm glad I didn't waste my time on the rest. So so so disappointing! Argh! Does Rowling really think the world is filled with nothing but vulgar, miserable people? I heard her describe this novel as a tragic comedy. Well, the comedy is very subtle indeed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it doesn't have that much because It is the alpha version not the one for Pc this is the very first edition of minecraft I am sure there will be more updates coming
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book.  It kept your interest and had you wanting more.  I can't wait for the next installment!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app on my kindle fire. Before, logging in and using the Pinterest website was a pain, now it is simple, easy to navigate and repin items. The layout looks nice too, images are the perfect size and can be enlarged.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Maybe i am getting too old for these kind of movies, but the originality of Bridesmaid and Finding Sarah Marshall is tried here, and it just doesn't quite make it.  Good acting, some funny parts, but the over the top stuff is not that funny and appears too staged rather than potentially possible.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I didn't get it at first lol. but now that I do no more magazine clipping or flipping for me. its so neat. I love finding creative ideas for everything imaginable.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I actually found myself even though I am an 80's classic rock and country kind of listener, actually liking the music, the girl can sing.  My younger girls 7 and 9 were loving the movie and it was not overtly sexual in any way and the language was great so I was not nervous about letting them watch the movie.  I liked it and it gives a glimpse as to the crazy world that the music world is about.  If you like her music you will like it a lot, if you don't then why are you even reading this.
0439023513|1.0|I second many of the other reviewers who are blasting this book.  Yes, I enjoyed the first book (Hunger Games) but was a bit disappointed with the second (Catching Fire).  This third book, though, is atrocious.  It was so frustrating to read chapter after boring chapter of Katniss' \\"assault\\" on the Capitol only to have it all have been for nothing since she was eventually whisked to safety by a hovercraft.  So. . .what was the point of all the lame action that the reader was put through for hundreds of pages if that's how things were going to be resolved?  Also, I'm not giving this book a bad review because it lacked a 'happy ending' (as many folks who are awarding this book 5-stars are claiming).  Honestly, I would have had more respect for this book if Suzanne Collins had gone the whole way and just killed Katniss off instead of the contrived final epilogue that's just sort of tacked onto the end.  Ugh.  Give this one a pass.  Terrible, boring read.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|this game rocks, i like it alot. it's similar to mario kart, you just have to get used to the controls and handling and your golden.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a great way of passing the time, BUT it has abuilt in stop to keep you from wasting too much time playing. (unless you are great at it)  It is the game as a kid I always enjoyed playing but never had the time or the quarters to play.  Well worth down loading.
B00846REIS|1.0|The similarities between this book and \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" were endless!  If you want to read a more raunchy version of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" this is your book.  There isn't any chemistry between the two main characters at all as hard as the author tried to make there be.  This book is awful.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was referred this book by a friend and thought what the heck.  It is very much along  the exact same line as Fifty Shades of Grey......almost to a T.  However, Bared to You seems very far fetched in how the two characters begin their \\"relationship\\".  Don't get me wrong, I love the book.  I just wish it was a little more realistic.
B004EYT932|5.0|This has been an interesting read though not always an easy one.  The authors have divided the book so that the highly technical data can be taken separately from their conclusions.  This is helpful!  Some of the graphs are perfectly comprehensible to a lay-reader but some are pretty opaque to me even after a few long-ago econ classes.  The upshot is that the most recent financial catastrophe was perfectly predictable: highly leveraged banking systems combined with expensive wars usually (almost invariably) produce disaster.
B00000JZI9|4.0|I have not watched this video yet, but it is one of my favorite Western  movies.<br />It seems to be in good condition also.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book kept me interested from page 1.... And kept me guessing until after I was done reading it! I will have to read more of Blake Crouch for sure
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A Wanted Man is another classic Reacher novel.  Lee Child continues to write stories that are believable and entertaining.  Highly recommend!
B00973DDN2|5.0|As per usual, The Killers rock!  This album proves you can go away for 4 years and come back with serious quality music!  BUY!!!
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun game. Great graphics. Lots of levels.Only thing,I wish there where hints. Some levels are pretty tricky.Overall a very good time killer.
B00932HEX2|3.0|If we hadn't purchased the entire season, I probably would have given up on this series by the 2nd episode. I'm up to Episode 12 in 'Hatufim' ('Prisoners of War'), the Israeli series on which 'Homeland' is vaguely based and that series is so much the superior in writing and subtlety that it is sadly unfair to compare the two.<br /><br />That said, after Episode 3, 'Homeland' hit a wobbly stride that is carried along by Danes and Lewis.  While I found bug-eyed Danes almost unbearable to watch in Episode 1 & 2, she finally does arrive at something like a shaded character portrayal by Episode 3.  Lewis does what he can and more with whatever he's given but there were many points where I just did not believe Brody's actions were anything more than plot devices.  In later episodes, there are a bunch of the usual mechanics that don't make sense, but by that time you don't really care, you just want some kind of climax...and that you get.  It will be interesting to see what they come up with for Season 2 that will be anywhere near as compelling.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my two favorite writers of all time. He has a talent for keeping every book new and different from the others. I can picture his stories in my mind as I read and his knowledge of history is spot on. Keep those brilliant books coming Mr. Gillette and I will continue reading every one of them.
B0086449YA|5.0|I am a fanatic, so my review will only mean something to my fellow Knopfler-ites.  This is his best work since \\"Shangri-La.\\"  While I've enjoyed his last few CDs, this one has a fantastic mix of blues and classic Mark Knopfler folk sound that's been missing on the last few albums (which you should still buy anyway).  I thought his last few works tended a bit to be too slow-paced, but on \\"Privateering\\" he returns to some of his livelier songwriting.  Well worth the time and money!
0446585025|5.0|I purchased this book because I read all her other books.  Laughed so hard, at one point, I thought I was having a heart attack!!!!!!  I was literally asked to leave work until I could get myself together.  Missed a whole day....Just thinking about some of the things I read make me start laughing all over again!  One of the funniest books I've ever read!!!!!  LOVE Ellen!!!!!  She rocks!  thank you, Mrs. B. Lacey

B003YL4LYI|3.0|GRRR Martin has created a complex, rich, textured world that shows great insight into the personal, social, political, military, economic, and sexual forces that must have shaped the evolution of Europe in the middle ages.  On top of that, he's incorporated some pretty colorful dragons and zombies.  (I keep waiting for him to role out some Vampires).<br /><br />He creates compelling believable characters and riveting stories.  His prose is venerable and the books have been made into one of the best television series I have ever seen.  This world and its people are created in exquisite detail, which is part of why the story is so rich and realistic.<br /><br />That said, I have two issues with his pentad:  at times, it reads far too slowly to keep my interest, and there are too many characters and subplots for anyone save an idiot savant to remember, so that he must resort to complex appendices to help the reader sort through it.  I'm happy to slog my way through the details of European history, but i don't wish to work that hard for Westerosian fantasy.<br /><br />The fourth book left several characters we have grown to care about in the midst of unresolved conflict:  Jon Snow, Bran, Tyrion, Sansa, Jaime, Arya and Daenys.  Hopefully, the histories will be resolved and unified in the fifth book.<br /><br />That was compelling reason enough to read it, but now one is faced with at least 10 more characters and their various tangential tribulations.  I think this is a flaw in plotting.  It reminds me of the TV series \\"Lost,\\" which similarly LOST me in its extraordinary, myriad convolutions.
1932907009|5.0|I've been writing screenplays for 10 years and I've read plenty of how-to books, but Blake's is by far the best and really the only one you should read.<br /><br />He's straight and to the point. It's a fun read and a knowledgable one. Blake's 15 beat sheet has changed the way I write and for the better. It has immediately improved my storytelling skills and has made the scripting process a breeze, an enjoyable one at that.<br /><br />If you want to write a good script that will actually have a chance to SELL, not just sit in some dark and stormy folder in the fruit cellar of your hard drive, then pick up this book.
0312330537|1.0|I listened to the 43 hour CD version of this book.  The book does contain some very interesting parts.  However, the silly philosophical ramblings, and the boring conversations took up what seemed to be about half the book.  Why not get an editor to cut the book down to something better?  That really would have helped.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a cool game. reminds me when I am at the casino. I always enjoyed this game and actually like playing it kn my kindle.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Use this alot. At least once a day maybe more. Easy to use. Lets you no how much time in each area like music, movies and other things. Its a keeper.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Fun the read, but very over the top in a sex enhanced manner, that might makes your sad and sometimes wondering how the rest of the world is living their lives
B0094OLJD0|4.0|If you like the Talking Heads, you'll like this album. David Byrne hasn't been able to transcend his original sound despite his many tries. That being said this album has a nice techno beat with a brass section that complements the vocals quite nicely. St. Vincent's vocals are a nice treat and the lyrics match the music for a sound that is no head and just talking. Well that's all from here, I've got to go pick the sand out of my Vaseline.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a great app for users who already have it on their phones. It's just like the original just way bigger. It doesn't glitch or freeze up like it does on my phone, and i get to compare ny scores with other players globally.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I am a huge HP fan so I had to get JK's new book. I have to say that there are too many characters which makes it confusing. The story also isn't that interesting.
0553801473|4.0|So, after reading so many other peoples reviews I have to say I wasn't even sure if I should buy this book but all in all I'm glad I did.  Ok, some parts drag on and sometimes I found myself checking ahead to see who chapter was on but I'm still glad I bought it.  I think every series has book or two that is more of a downtime, informational kind of thing but that usually means the author is building up to some big event that pulls it all together.  So, while I did not by any means, think this was the best book in the series I still look forward to reading the next installment to see how it all ties together
B006P96PAO|5.0|Very good movie about god and values<br />Very encouraging<br />A movie that Must see for all<br />Good for all family including small kids
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was playing MC from 4shared, but then it was on the appstore and I bought it not much long after. It has great gameplay and is flawless on my kindle fire. I can't wait for the next update. But it could use some more stuff, for example, rails/minecarts, buckets, a larger map, and fire/lava. But overall an awesome game, thank you Mojang.
B006LSZECO|1.0|As someone who reads an average of one or more mystery/thriller books per week on my Kindle, I am utterly amazed that this book reached the top of the list of best sellers. I kept reading for the first 40% of the book because even though it was horribly written and completely boring I kept thinking there must be a reason so many people bought it. I was thinking that Gloria Steinem had written a soap opera. Finally it began to have a minimum of suspense, but it never reached the level of mediocrity. Then I got to the ending. At least I think it was and ending. Maybe it was meant as a teaser for a follow up novel. If so it is certainly one that I will not waste my money on.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it love it. great game to play with friends or alone. keeps you out of trouble and you can eat bologna while you play
B006LR0XLM|5.0|\\"Dropbox\\" certainly takes the pain out of taking photographs with your cell phone.  Now, you take a picture or a video and you don't have to go through the hassle of transferring them to your PC, even while you travel.  Not only do the photos/video will automatically transfer wherever you are, but any document you drop into \\"dropbox\\" will automatically appear at your home computer, laptop or whatever you have it set up on. Simply a very convenient way to move information from you cell to your computer.  I think this is very cool...what will they think of next? Kevin...Virginia
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not going to buy this on my kindle until the price goes down.  It is already in paperback, where there is an actual expense to produce the book itself.  Kindle version is digital...it costs nothing to reproduce it or distribute it...Lower the damn price already!

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Thank you the product arrived in great condition.  This is one of my alltime favorite movies.  I have already watched it three times this weekend.  Thank again for getting the product out to me in a timely manner.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in only two days. I just could not stop reading it! Before you turn it down I don't think of it much like a love story like twilight. It is more action than anything. I am definitely saving up for the movie!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved this book so much better than Bared to You.  I had to read it twice in order to pick up on the little things that meant so much to the story that was missed the first time I read it.<br /><br />I read the 50 Shades series as well and really liked them, but this series was hands down better and more real.
1400069289|2.0|Smokers, alcoholics, and viewers of The Bachelorette now have a reason to rejoice - personal habits can be changed!<br /><br />Duhigg explains that there are three elements of the habit loop: cue, routine, and reward. Old habits never die, but the trick to changing behavior is to replace old routines with the new while keeping the same cues and rewards. It is with this premise that he explores various personal, corporate, and societal anecdotes that loosely connect with his central premise.<br /><br />Duhigg explores the academic research on habits and does a good job of explaining the studies so that a laymen can understand. However, the book lacks the insightful depth that I was hoping for which would certainly be a disappointment for psychology majors or anyone who has read a book or two on cognitive behavioral topics. It is not a difficult concept to understand, and yet the habit loop diagram appears repeatedly throughout the book. I know this is a trivial point to make, but the diagram added no value whatsoever and just reassures that the book contains a lot of filler without trying to explain more complex behavioral psychology topics.<br /><br />Certain stories (Starbucks, Target) were more intriguing than others, but the majority did not support the premise at all. The worse violator was the Tony Dungy story which had a lot of quotes that did not say much of anything about habits. It was the explanatory sentences following the quotes that eventually connected the story back to the premise non-persuasively.<br /><br />The book concept is great, the academic research was presented for a layman's audience, and the anecdotal stories were interesting albeit they did not support his premise.  Do not read this book. Instead, read Duhigg's more concise Nytimes article published on 2/19/2012 on the same subject.  The article is identical to the book, but saves you from all the extra fluff.
B008VBYN80|1.0|this game has such potential its almost worth the pay to play; however the consistent freeze and lock out is plain thievery after you have paid additional funds just to play.  it is slightly addictive which is why you might buy in but the end result is no access to the game you built and resounding regret that you bothered once or even twice...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great series, I have really enjoyed the first two books and am really enjoying this one just as much. Get all three you will like them a lot. A very good read.

0316228532|2.0|Like the myriad of reviewers before me have said, The Casual Vacancy is certainly not Harry Potter, but it is still J.K. Rowling. The book is written in her word using the same flourishing writing styles of the beloved pages of Harry Potter, and for this reason, it is impossible to separate the two. If you have never read a word penned by Rowling prior, than this book might take on an entirely different role for you. If, however, like so many others, you have read her works, it is downright impossible to forget them.<br /><br /> The Casual Vacancy is a tale about the pseudo-adults and official `legal' adults in neighboring districts: Pagford, Yarvil, and the Fields. It is a book about how our choices have rippling effects well beyond what we intend and about how it is impossible to live one's life free from politics, religious qualms, and/or the grievances of society. Each character is distinct and well described. For this reason, I must award the book one star. The second star, comes from Jo's ability to put words on paper and create settings, people, and worlds that are entirely her own. The difference between this world and the world of Harry Potter, however, is that it is entirely and solely her own. It is very difficult to feel any sort of immersion or connection to the characters and their world despite the 500+ pages she has devoted to it.<br /><br /> While I am glad that I read through the novel once, it is not one that will be placed upon my permanent shelf next to her others. Should there be a sequel, it is not a world I would want to visit again. The inability to relate, the grimness, and the moroseness of it all keep me from coming back for more. I wish Jo all the best in her future endeavors, and by all means, since Jo is so iconic, give the book a chance yourself, but do not be surprised to find it merely collecting dust after the initial read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game to kill some time. all of the games are pretty ready so far. they are all fairly easy to catch onto. suggested for everyone!
0142410373|5.0|I recommend this book because it is a fun and creative book. It always has magic or a potion, or they don't like each other. Also, he has written other books. Matilda is a girl who her parents despise. Once someone insults her she uses her eyes knocks them over or moves something. I would recommend this book to anyone who love fiction books and magic.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|4 1/2 Stars for another installment in this extremely smexy romance.<br /><br />Very few authors for whom I would pay 9.99 for a Kindle book.<br /><br />Again, do I believe a heroine who works all day, goes to a demanding training class and then has sex all night? Do I believe she has a billionare and a rock star chasing her?<br /><br />Nah, but what the heck, it's a fun story. With plenty of larger than life sex, angst, and conflict. a hugely surprise ending.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|cool game cool game fun addictive takes a while to get better scoring but i enjoy playing cool game try it.  you'll like it.
B00846REIS|4.0|4 & 1/2 Stars<br /><br />Sylvia Day has created a great big smexy soap opera of a story. She plays her two larger-than-life, intense characters off of each other, against the background of NYC, playground for the wealthy.<br /><br />Do I believe a 28 year old billionaire who owns half of NYC and a quarter of Vegas? With the looks of a Hollywood star and the stamina of a bull? Um, no.<br /><br />Am I jealous as a cat of a heroine who can apparently chow down on any amount of any kind of food, and maintain a figure that has every man lusting after her? Heck, yes.<br /><br />But I'm willing to go along for the thrill ride anyway to find out what hijinx these two and their scheming relatives, ex-es and friends are up to.<br /><br />Extremely erotic romance you won't soon forget.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|Oh, sod off. This book just makes me truly angry.<br />If that is how you want to be a woman, then by all means, go right ahead. Just please get out of my face.<br /><br />There were moments in this book that were fun, (like maybe two?) but mostly it just felt like misogyny from a woman. Kind of like the ultimate betrayal. I cannot believe that I have fought for our rights for decades, and THIS is what we've got to work with now.<br />Remark: this author is a brilliant writer. I just cannot stand what she is saying, while she is giggling hysterically. Well, all by herself, because she did not pull one laugh from me. Ra ra ra.<br /><br />Calling people retards? *sigh*<br /><br />The parts where Ms Moran talks about feminism just plain hurt. Disappointment and great shame.<br /><br />But the worst part? It was downright f***ing boring.<br /><br />At $10.99 this was a huge disappointment.<br />***<br />I was NOT asked to read this book by anyone, I paid for it with my own money, as I do for all the books I read, all the music I listen to and the movies I watch.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I'm afraid, the loss of a single star in my review has less to do with the author, Walter Isaacson. Nearly a year has passed since he died, and I took the time to finally read the book. It's clear in every step of the way that Steve Jobs was a force to be reckoned with and passionate to his dying day. His love for technology - or rather, creating - is unrivaled in today's Fortune 500. Jobs' strength was his ability to bring the most creative minds together and sell their visions. Isaacson makes it abundantly clear how Jobs took too much credit at times.<br /><br />The biographer was limited, though. It appears that Jobs continued to hold back. It was all carefully controlled. Clearly, Jobs had to know that prior coworkers would bad mouth him or, at least, divulge the terrible tantrums that destroyed people in the wake. But throughout the book, I questioned the information received. What did Jobs really believe and think? What really motivated him?<br /><br />Isaacson's strength is in his critical portrayal of Jobs. One of the strangest pieces is Jobs' self-identified Zen Buddhism. Jobs highlights this as a major growth factor to his success, but his actions are anything but... The biographer is quick to point out this simple discrepancy - finally holding Jobs accountable for words versus actions.<br /><br />This was hard to put down and incredibly well written.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I love every season of himym! This season is great! So many milestones, hilarious jokes, references and still leaving us guessing! It's sad to hear that season 8 is the last :(.
1609611543|5.0|Amazing information concerning the effects of hybridized wheat on the human body.  Stopped consuming any product or food containing wheat and lost 9 pounds and two inches in 5 weeks.  It was easier to do then I expected.  Have told all my friends to get the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The 2nd book of the Hunger Game series, Catching Fire, kept me as spell bound as the first book.  I like the prices for the ebooks.
B009LZEZSI|5.0|Darren Criss singing \\"Teenage Dream\\" was so sad. You could see this episode coming for some time, but still it was sad.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I've always liked Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation show on Travel channel, so this book was appealing to me. It fully lived up to my expectations! Boudain writes just like he talks on the show, no holds barred, honest, sometimes grotesque. He writes about all the gritty details he experiences in the world of the restaurant business. I liked that he also included another perspective from another chef, explaining how his own experience isn't necessarily everyone's experience in the industry. His life is very interesting and in this book he sticks mostly to the details of his career, rather than his personal life, although both are interesting. I would recommend this to anyone!
B009IF7JRA|4.0|Once again, glee was adorable. They are doing well this season with the dreaded high school to college transition for some of their characters. The music, of course, rocked.

B009K0OTVM|5.0|Revenge is back and better than ever. I love this show. I pined all summer for this show. It was definitely worth the wait!!
B007SGM084|2.0|The writing is embarrassingly poor, and the story is basically about incorporating fantasy into reality-badly. The story is okay as best, but don't look for intelligent reading here.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read many books described as thrillers and they succeed when the authors create a story line of some complexity, descriptively written with insights of life, events that entice and reveal, a plot line of surprise and imagination that with its unfolding holds me captured in the web of the writers' words, and as a kind of model for all successful mysteries, a final denouement in the last pages. When I close the book, I want to feel a combination of slight exhaustion and fantasy fulfilled - perhaps like good sex! Or that sense of discovery we call the \\"aha moment\\". Gillian Flynn didn't make it.<br /><br />Her story construction seemed a little tedious at first, although later the value of this particular style became more important. Still, the reading reached its high point well before the final chapters, and as I read on I came to a point of \\"so what\\". It seemed that each character had reached individual check points and might better have acknowledged that neither had won or lost. They might have come to a better solution for their futures by shaking hands and departing the field of battle.<br /><br />Steig Larsson achieved my ideal. (Jo Nesbo comes close.)
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Always intrigued to see what Jack is up to. His character is so unique and suspenseful. Look forward to his next adventure.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Must be something in the water in Iceland. I cannot get these songs out of my head. And why would i want to? Lovely, infectious folkish pop. Beautiful  complex melodies,  magnificently played.  Each song is a gem. Lock on your headphones and stroll somewhere w/ this in your ears. Wherever you go will become a special, memorable place.
B00943SQCI|1.0|For all us that remember the whimsy of the original TV series this effort was a colossal disappointment. Even the greatness of Johnny Depp is utterly wasted in this disaster. I believe any group of 3 teenagers could write a better script in a matter of minutes... I doubt I will ever be able to find a worse movie.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Not up to the same level as other recent Jason Segel comedies. Has a few funny moments but very slow in the middle. Watch Sarah Marshall again instead.
0525953728|5.0|From the first page to the last, this book held my interest very close. I appreciated the Author's attention to detail without giving out any vital, military secrets. I was also appreciative of the way other operations and training were woven in to this story so that I understood where the Author started out from to get to the actual mission of trying to capture Osama Bin Laden.
B008PNBU30|4.0|Trasit of Venis in my opinion is a very solid album. I wasn't too impressed with their previous album Life Starts Now. After hearing Chalk Outline, I didn't think I was gonna be with this one either. It surprised me. My favorites are Give In To Me, Happiness, and Give Me A Reason. I think it has a mixture of One - X and their debut. Which to me, is definitely a good thing.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This movie is one of the most scary movies I have seen! I strongly recommend this movie to anyone. You will jump from your seat!
B004I744AS|5.0|First off, I'd like to say it was one of the best dictionaries I've ever used.  not only does it give definitions to words you want to know, but you can find out new words and synonyms instantly.  it has all the cool features such as hangman or spelling bee or horoscopes.  so you can learn new words and find out definitions for tricky words.<br /><br />the price is cheap, well free, so that makes it all the better.
1439102813|5.0|This was a very poignant book. I have an aunt with Alzheimer's Disease and this was not only a good story but so informative. I would reccomend the book to anyone with a family that has Alzheimer's.

I love<br />reading first hand accounts of the stories of our service men and women who<br />have actually seen, heard or been a part of what they are writing about.<br />\\"Lone Survivor\\" was the first book I read that was written by a Navy Seal and it was super also. Maybe this book will get the truth out about what really happened on the day Bin Laden was taken out.<br /><br />As a former Marine during the Viet Nam area I say Semper Fi guys and God Speed.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|One of the best shows ever.  Would love to see a movie! Season 2 was not quite as good as the first season, but it's still extremely enjoyable.

0062127241|5.0|Though nowhere--and I mean nowhere--near as good as the autobiography from Curt Cobain entitled Heavier than Heaven, Pete's Who Am I? is still an amazingly breathtaking autobiography that really lets all readers into Pete's cerebellum in a way that is both intimate and flirtatious. I don't know about my fellow Amazonians, but I have been absolutely dying to get inside Pete's cerebellum since I heard that Pete was being investigated for child p/o/r/n back in 2003! Luckily for me, Who Am I? tells me all that I want to know about Pete's life and still other things that are best left to British police investigations (read: Prince Charles stings).<br /><br />I want to honor the time of every reader of this review, which is why I will use brevity in just quickly highlighting what I think are just a few of the startling revelations in Who Am I?<br /><br />Did you know that, when Pete smashed his 1st guitar (accidentally) on stage back in 1964...he was just \\"researching\\" child p/o/r/n then, too?!<br /><br />Did you know that, when Pete claims to have heard the voice of \\"God\\" on a vibrating bed in Illinois, he was, number one, actually in San Francisco and, two, actually hearing the voice of Allah?<br /><br />Did you know that, when Pete simultaneously invented the concept album, feedback and the Marshall stack, he also invented the Snuggie, the Hurrycane and even the Snakelight at the same time?<br /><br />Did you know that, when Pete got banned from Holiday Inns for life, he was also banned from Howard Johnsons, Ramada Inns and Motel 6s, but was actually made a lifelong honorary guest of Best Western?!<br /><br />Did you know that, when Pete did too much cocaine, had too much to drink and did too much LSD that he nearly died, he also had a little bit too much of a Taco Bell burrito and, thus, had really bad d/i/a/r/rhea for a period of 24 hours?<br /><br />Did you know that, when Pete inspired Hendrix's pyrotechnical craft, he also was the model for Hendrix's afro?<br /><br />Wow! Absolutely unbelievable, and I have read a whole ton of musical autobiographies in my long life!<br /><br />Finally, I just want to say that, although I'm a huge fan of Pete's and read his book in a few hours (because I can speed read thanks to taking a course at my local high school night school), there are better autobiographies than his that really show what it is to be entertaining, interesting and classy all at the same time. I'm of course talking about Screech's earth-shattering Saved by the Bell autobiography called Behind the Bell: Ding-Dong, Ding-Dong, Tommy Chong's The I Chong: Meditations from my Drug Dealer, and, naturally, Vanilla Ice's 1991 Ice by Ice.r />Wow!

B005LAII0I|3.0|\\"Mirror Mirror\\" is a family picture based on a tale of Snow White. Directed by Tarsem Singh (\\"The Cell,\\" \\"The Fall,\\" and \\"Immortals\\"), the film is great to look at (Oscar-winning designer Eiko Ishoika's final work), and some characters are fun to watch, but the retold version of a well-known fairy tale does not offer much else.<br /><br />\\"Mirror Mirror\\" retains most of the elements found in a Brothers Grimm book - a dark forest, a magical mirror, a poisoned apple, a kiss, etc. - but they are used in a totally different way. In the modern-day take of the fairy tale, the heroine Snow White (Lily Collins) learns swordsmanship, fights for her own destiny, and changes the others' for the better. Well, except one.<br /><br />Julia Roberts plays a wicked queen. Actually she plays two roles, the queen and her (much darker) reflection. Perhaps I am not the only one who thought the cynical version of her on the magical mirror is more interesting than the \\"original,\\" which somehow lacks the complexity the other is given. Things liven up when the queen attempts to entice the rich and handsome prince (Armie Hammer) into marriage. We need more of it.<br /><br />This is not to say \\"Mirror Mirror\\" is bad. It is just most of the film's episodes are tame. The film needs a narrative that is faster and brisker. The rousing musical number at the end (a Bollywood-style rendition of an old Nina Hart song) has the razzle-dazzle and fun that is much needed in the narrative that precedes it.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The book is really good. I saw the show first, so that might color my opinion, however, I might prefer reading it. It is a quick read and it makes it easier to know who everyone in the show is. I recommend it if you have not seen the show, watch casually, or just want a good book for a flight/vacation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game and its best for time pass but they must add millions of new games so that means 11 hours of fun

B004UJAOLM|4.0|Wuthering Heights is an old classic with old English language worth rereading for those who appreciate this type of novel.  Charlotte Bronte' was an excellent writer.
B0000630BT|5.0|I've had this album for over 20 years, in 4 different formats (LP, Cassette, CD and Digital) and it NEVER gets old.  From the insane drum intro to Painkiller, to the rally hymn of One Shot At Glory, it is impecable from start to finish.  This album doesn't have one single weak song on it, and it's phenomonal from start to finish, over and over.  Truely one of the shining gems in the crown that is metal.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is far more illuminating than expected.  I can understand why the government did not want it published.  It does not reveal any secrets other than the inability of government decision makers to render a quick answer.  Ben Laden had escaped numerous times because of timing, but it took three weeks for those in charge to give the Seals a \\"go.\\"  Luckily, Ben Laden did not escape.  Government officials have had their revenge, though--they released the names of the Seals to Hollywood.  Training of this amazing group of men is fascinating.

0740797719|5.0|When I got to read such a painters guide: 'Color and Light:A Guide for the Realistic Painter by James Gurney\\"<br />so very much and much I have read before, much and much have I done before - for this I can tell you with a firm sense:<br />this is a nice artsy book, with lovely print paintings very well chosen for each topic,<br />that is going to make me a better artist!<br />The intriguing sequence of 'how-to' is easy to put into practise, because  Mr Gurney has made the obvious<br />secrets of art masters of many arts and times and places and cultures, suddenly make cristal clear sense.<br />A very well investment indeed !  Beware that without a few decades of practical working out<br />you may be buffled by the enormity of possibilities shown, and the simplicity of the means to achieve<br />great imagerymaking, but, alas, remember that pretty imagery needs pretty storytelling !<br />This is advanced technology for the use of colour and light, for those of us seeking the whole panorama for animation,<br />drawing and painting.  I did not ''get'' oil painting until this book...<br />The author writings are cristal clear, to the point and  brief and precise (God may thanks him for that)!

B000O78KW4|5.0|Lots of action with drama, comedy, and romance.  Everthing I like in a movie with Bruce Willis.  Very good ending.
B001CTDH76|5.0|The first season was most delightful; his arrogance and presumptiveness gave me ideas of giving him a slap. Food plays a part in his character, especially when it belongs to someone else; someone he doesn't even know. He is clever, and reads people well, which play even larger parts of his character. Just love it.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Exciting, adventurous, drama, comedy;  what else can I say.  Digital images were something to behold.  Good movie for young and old but not too young.

I was desperate to read and find out what happens next.<br /><br />...and then i finished Mockinjay and was left feeling mixed.<br /><br />After 2 fantastic stories with building tension, action, desperation and passion, Mockingjay was disappointing and anti-climatic.<br /><br />The story and characters built up and up and up and then suddenly crashed back to earth.<br /><br />Mockingjay was the weakest book in an otherwise fantastic series.<br /><br />I urge everyone to read this series and judge for yourselves. Even though I am disappointed, I will do what I do with all the books I treasure - read them over and over and over again.
B008AT71WI|4.0|I've never been a fan of musicals. Although I enjoyed \\"Annie,\\" \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and other movies of that nature, I always found myself fast-forwarding through the musical numbers to get to the real meat and potatoes of the plot. That's how I felt for the most part watching \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" on Blu-ray for the first time. I did find a few of the songs humorous, but for the most part I found the musical numbers to be a distraction and break from the actual storyline. That's a funny thing to say about a beloved movie based on a hit play but that's how I feel.<br /><br />Seymour works and lives in a plant shop where he eeks out a sad and lonely existence. His work mate is the lovely physically and emotionally abused Audrey. He pines for her day in and day out but never tells her about his true feelings. While shopping one day, Seymour sees an interesting plant he's never encountered before. He buys it and takes it home, only to find out it's a blood-thirsty man-eater. The more it drinks and eats, the bigger it gets. Will Seymour give into its demands to be fed or will he destroy the plant before it gets out of control?<br /><br />\\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" couldn't look any better than it does in this \\"Director's Cut\\" Blu-ray version. The colors are vibrant and the picture is clean. Long-time viewers will be delighted to see the movie in high-definition finally. It will be like watching it for the first time all over again for them.<br /><br />The movie is presented in 5.1 surround sound that successfully distributes the musical numbers, dialogue, and sound effects all over your home theater. Every bit of Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and Steve Martin's singing is heard in ways they've never been heard before. It's an experience fans of this cult classic will be thrilled over.<br /><br />There are plenty of bonus materials to be excited about. The theatrical version with optional commentary is included along with the newly restored Director's Cut which has a 20-minute alternate ending. Frank Oz and Richard Conway provide an introduction for the Director's Cut. A \\"behind-the-scenes\\" documentary entitled \\"A Story of 'Little Shop of Horrors'\\" is featured. Deleted scenes and outtakes with optional commentary and two theatrical trailers are found as well. There's also a 40-page booklet with pictures, \\"making-of\\" stories, and trivia inside. A special note from Director Frank Oz addresses his cut of the film as well.<br /><br />I found both the theatrical and Director's Cut to be entertaining. However, the Director's Cut could have five minutes trimmed down from it and still be effective. The \\"Little Shop of Horrors: The Director's Cut\\" Blu-ray is worth every penny fans and newcomers will spend on it.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This series is fantastic.  I have recommended it to a number of people who are like me, couldn't put it down, or in my case quit couldn't stop listening.  Well written, very imaginative.  The characters begin to feel like family. The audio version is especially great as the reader uses a Scottish accent which I think lends a lot to the enjoyment of the series.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The Time Keeper was very interesting. Father Time had his job cut out for him. He certainly had some challenges but managed to bring two people together, that never would have crossed paths, in a most unusual way. I would say it was interesting, but not awe-inspiring. It was just an \\"OK\\" book for me. It was definitely different.
0307949486|5.0|Although I'm not much for crime novels, this was a thoroughly entertaining novel that had me in its grips. The story line takes a little while to get rolling, but once the character Lisbeth Salander is introduced, the book is nearly impossible to put down. The plot is cleverly done, the story fast-paced, and the characters well-drawn, especially Salander, the tattooed hacker for whom the story is named. This exciting, intelligent novel was one of the best books I've read in a long time. There is a lot of violence, including sexual violence, so this might not appeal to everyone.
184195392X|5.0|[[ASIN:184195392X Life of Pi]] by Yann Martel puzzled me right off the bat because I couldn't figure out if it was a true story or not. It's touted as fiction, but as the marvelous tale unfolds, with each successive incident seeming to be more spectacular and fantastic than the last, it didn't become any easier because the author was brilliantly able to root every event in the reality of the child's life whose story it is. Even as the bulk of the novel takes place on a large lifeboat populated solely by the small child and a 500 pound Bengal tiger, I was at war within my mind as to the veracity of the events being related. the writing is so thoroughly convincing that I was taken in completely by this beautiful novel. With his precise prose, Martel carries the reader through from the vivid disaster of the floating menagerie that results in the two unlikely shipwreck companions, to an impossible oasis in the middle of the ocean that feels perfectly real, and onto the inevitable end that manages to convey the strange amalgam of emotions that broils within the survivor of such a harrowing ordeal. I balked at the premise upon first picking it up, but escaping into [[ASIN:184195392X Life of Pi]] was time well spent.

0316776963|3.0|[[ASIN:0316776963 Me Talk Pretty One Day]] by David Sedaris is a collection of his personal essays and my first experience with this genre or type of work. I found them, in general, to be thoroughly enjoyable. The author's style conjures a comfortable and friendly tone that is flavored with a sly wit which is sure to put a slim grin on the reader's face. Passages about his childhood and family are entirely relatable, often hilarious, and Sedaris' discourse on the state of the Cineplex and movie watching in America makes me long for the more intimate experiences of the movie houses that he describes. Not the most cohesive of collections, as his topics are wide-ranging, but the essay \\"Youth In Asia\\" still makes me laugh every time I think about it.

0439023513|5.0|[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] by Suzanne Collins marks the conclusion to her Hunger Games Trilogy, and with it, she keeps the reader on their toes by tackling issues that seem decidedly mature for young adult fiction.Through the eyes of the protagonist and narrator Katniss Everdeen, the author deftly probes the disparities between being heralded as a leader exalted as a figurehead and the common struggles of a human being - a teenaged girl with all the inherent insecurities and stubbornness that come with that designation. Katniss vacillates between the roles thrust upon her: those of savior, lover, caretaker. It is these moments of selfish indecision punctuated by exhibitions of true selflessness and heroism that make Katniss all the more real and accessible as she struggles to fit into the bleak and confusing new world which she had a hand in creating. The way her handlers deal with Katniss is full of clever commentary on propaganda and the nature of modern warfare, but there's lots of action as well. Poison gas, mutated monsters, and a deadly obstacle course provide plenty of chaos for Katniss and her compatriots to maneuver through in their push to the capitol where their rebellion is destined to culminate. Collins delivers plot twists that are at turns unexpected, shocking, and heartbreaking, and she succeeds marvelously in bringing the story arc to a satisfying end.
B0098VXE50|3.0|Really, really interesting re-interpretation of the fairytale that brings out the violence of the original fairy tale while not dumbing the story, itself, down for today's movie audience of ADD kids.<br /><br />The scenery and costumes are period correct, the fighting is believable and the magic effects and fantasy elements are superbly invented and do not at all look like the \\"too clean\\" CGI of some films. It is superbly acted with the exception of the, as usual, awful Kristen Stewart who again bitchfaces her way through a role looking as stuck-up and disinterested as she is in real life. Hemsworth is AMAZING as a man who has given up on life and finds something to fight for in the promise of restoring Snow White to the throne of her father. Charlize Theron gives depth and meaning to the character of the Evil Queen who, in this variation, married and murdered Snow White's father. The writers actually give Ravenna a post-feminist spin by making her a wronged woman whose mother is murdered by feudal lords.<br /><br />THERE ARE DWARVES! They use the perspective trick from the Lord of the Rings movies to make it work. It's really a great story and WOULD have been a great movie if not for the horrible, horrible performance of Kristen Stewart.
0439023491|4.0|The aptly titled [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]] by Suzanne Collins is the second novel in the Hunger Games Trilogy and begins just a few short months after the events that concluded the first novel. As this second installment unfolds, there are sparks of upheaval and rebellion as well as glowing embers of young love beginning to catch aflame. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, has the label of revolutionary thrust upon her while having to deal with the conflicting feelings of burgeoning love for two different boys. Collins carries the reader through this deftly without descending into treacly territory, and makes the emotional struggles of the young woman Katniss both believable and relevant. In an effort to quell rebellion and end the Messiah-like status Katniss is beginning to wield, a plan is manipulated into place to put her back into harm's way. This provides the bulk of the plot and action, of which there is plenty. All of it culminates in an ending that manages to be both triumphant and devastatingly shocking.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|So I read the books before I watched the movie, and while the books were amazingly well written, I preferred the movie because I was not as horrified. Yet again movies somehow managed to gloss over the sheer depravity of human kind and turned it into a form of entertainment.
0307346617|3.0|My copy of [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] written by Max Brooks was gifted to me by a friend after the title came up during a long discussion of all things sci-fi related. Having never been too big on the whole zombie craze, I was skeptical, but trusted my friend's taste. Max Brooks surprised me to no end with the depth and ingenuity of his fictional history and left me wondering on a very practical level how one might go about surviving a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Some survivor accounts in [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] are told as narratives, others imparted in a Q & A type format, which makes for a quick read as the reader is constantly transitioning to another point of view, another harrowing tale of sacrifice and survival. The fact that each character's voice comes across as so distinct and unique is testament to the author's undeniable talent. Also, in an age when ethnocentrism seems to be more a badge of honor than a criticism, it's interesting and refreshing to see Brooks tackle the global ramifications and actions in the face of a zombie apocalypse as opposed to just the fallout in the U.S. of A. However one's tastes of preferences may run, WWZ is worth the read if only to be marveled at and entertained by the meticulousness of the author's imagination.
0399230033|5.0|Wow, I was surprised at how quickly my son took to this book.  I bought it for him when he was ~11 months old.  We had been reading to him a lot ever since he was born.  Some books he likes more than others, but this was the first book that he actually threw a tantrum about when we took it away.  I must have read it to him 20 times the first night because he loved it so much.  The first week we actually had to take it in the car with us a few times to prevent the meltdown and tears!!  I'm sure every child is different, but I definitely recommend giving this one a shot if your little one likes being read to.  FUN TIP:  Try getting your little one to find the read balloon on all of the pages.
0439023521|4.0|In the face of all the hype, I fully expected to loathe [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]] by Suzanne Collins. I'm glad to report that I was dead wrong. The book depicts a hyper-violent time in the indistinctly distant future where gladiatorial-type games amount to annual human sacrifices to serve as a reminder of the consequences of rebellion. From the hardscrabble manual labor of coal miners, to the decadence of the capitol, to the death in the arena, Collins manages to maintain an eighth grade reading level while still keeping it interesting for this non-young adult reader. Likewise, her descriptions of violence are vivid and present enough so that the reader is brought face-to-face with it, but never has their nose rubbed in it. This being the first book in a trilogy, it does an excellent job of bringing the narrative to a satisfying conclusion while still leaving the reader wanting more and wondering what happens next.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games starts with an engaging protagonist, Katniss, and continues with an explosive premise: an annual death match between two dozen tributes.  The games push Katniss and the other tributes to their physical, mental, emotional, and moral limits.<br /><br />However, one part of the game dynamics bothers me.  I'll have to warn you: spoilers ahead.<br /><br />There are two kinds of tributes.  Most districts choose their tribute by lottery (shades of Shirley Jackson), but three of the districts train some of their children for the games and volunteer them -- the \\"career\\" tributes.<br /><br />In the arena, the career tributes kill most of the lottery-chosen tributes (the innocent ones), and then Katniss kills most of the careers.  The innocent lottery-chosen tributes rarely kill each other (although Peeta kills at least one); the careers don't kill each other, except perhaps in the case of the first career who died on the first day.  The heroine kills 4 out of the 6 careers and none of the non-careers.  This is an old formula: bad guys kill innocents; then the heroes kill bad guys -- that way the heroes get to engage in violence and still be good guys.<br /><br />Suppose those tracker jackers had been more effective and the last five tributes were Katniss, Peeta, Foxface, Thresh, and Rue?<br /><br />Aside from that, though, the book is strong in many ways.<br /><br />Collins shows a lot of violence without making it look sexy.  Getting into a fight is often bad for both parties and the consequences of a wound are severe.<br /><br />The people who run the game manipulate and pressure the tributes in a lot more ways than just putting them in an arena together.  The interplay between tributes, mentors, and sponsors is subtle and dangerous.<br /><br />Several of the tributes besides Katniss try different approaches to the game.  Foxface never speaks and appears in only a few scenes, but her unique strategy provoked me to a lot of thought.  Similarly, I don't see Thresh much, but there are tantalizing bits of clues.  I still haven't figured out Peeta's plan -- and maybe that's intentional; maybe he was too overwhelmed to have a good plan.<br /><br />Haymitch fascinates and horrifies by turns.  Collins does not make him give a speech saying why; she just shows Haymitch and the reader figures him out along with Katniss.  And in a horrifying moment, Katniss realizes that if she lives, she will have to do Haymitch's job.<br /><br />Caesar has an unexpected streak of goodness.  Is he just good at his job, or does he really give a damn?  I'm interested in reading more about him in the sequel.

B0098VXBIA|2.0|With the exception of a few funny moments the best parts of this movie could be seen in the films trailers.
0756405890|2.0|I picked up this book expecting a lot from it.  After all, with praise from such high profile fantasy authors, and rave reviews on sites like Amazon, who wouldn't?  I love epic fantasy, and I love in-depth character fantasy.<br /><br />This book is not in-depth character.<br /><br />There is a lot for Rothfuss to be commended.  I find his writing style, though not necessarily elegant, certainly engaging (a sort of Brandon Sanderson-lite) and I could easily go through chapters at a time in one sitting.  Also, some of the fantastical ideas?  Very cool.  Particularly the potential for the Chandrian (especially once you learn the history of the Chandrian) and the ominous future implied by the spider-like Scrael.  I also love the idea of naming things - again, cool magic.  It's a nicely realized world and a nicely realized fantasy system.<br /><br />But all the problems of the book come down to the characterization (or in this case, lack thereof).  Putting aside Kvothe for a moment, there isn't a single character in this book I felt had any depth.  In general, characters fall into two categories: those who instantly like Kvothe for no apparent reason (as demonstrated by his two best friends at the University Wil and Sim - they both like him instantly and have this loyal friendship, but he doesn't show to us any of its development, or why they're both so loyal to him); and people who dislike him simply because they're just jerks.  The brunt of the novel is built around an antagonistic relationship with the character of Ambrose whose reasons for disliking Kvothe are so vague (because Kvothe told him off...once?) and it demonstrates how Rothfuss is so interested in examining the outcome of things that he puts no effort into the path that gets them there, emotionally.  And the women themselves are another problem entirely.  Can we say, de-humanized objectification?  Can we say one-dimensionality?<br /><br />But really, the primary problem is Kvothe himself.  It's not just that Kvothe is larger-than-life who succeeds at *everything* (and I do mean everything).  I found myself wishing just once that someone else would legitimately triumph over him in some way.  Aside from physical confrontations (and those he only loses in the first half of the novel) no one is ever able to best him mentally, intellectually, or emotionally.  And I desperately wish that someone had.  Rothfuss gives a few throw-away lines at one instance indicating that other students at the University were beginning to resent him.  Oh, how showing that would've created sympathy for this character.  If I actually believed he was ever caught in any plight he might not escape from (or actually didn't escape or win out!) how much more I would've liked him.  I even found myself wondering at one point if the problem was Kvothe's arrogance - but then I realized, of course he's not arrogant, because that would be a character flaw!  Kvothe is truly perfect in every possible way, and I found him insufferable as a result.  It's not just that he always wins - it's that he always reacts to every situation perfectly.  His friends go behind his back to lose him his job?  Oh, he knows they were just doing what was best for him.  He gets banished from the Archives?  Well, it wasn't due to his own recklessness - no, of course, someone else tricked him into it.  Eventually, I even started actively rooting for antagonists like Ambrose in the hopes that someone somewhere would successfully take him down a peg.  And make no mistake - Kvothe is a Mary Sue.  I can't believe how many situations he walks into and wins or fixes for others.<br /><br />I found myself comparing this to Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy, which is also a first-person narrative of a male character looking back over and telling his life story.  But where Fitz is tragic and painfully human, Kvothe is likely going to be translated at the end of the series for being so very, very perfect.  And while Hobb's books are slow in the same way that this book is, they're compelling, because Fitz and his relationships are complex and compelling.  This book reads fine, but very little happens, and as it aspires to be character-driven, it falls flat on the basis of what an unrelateable character Kvothe is.  (Also, I feel like the book suffers from having no overarching narrative - which plays into the ending that wasn't really an ending, because there was nothing new learned in terms of plot, and nothing to be resolved). The most exciting part of the book for me came toward the end, when events finally drove Kvothe away from the university and I thought we were going to get more information about the vital pieces of the overarching fantasy story relating to the death of his parents.  But it never came.<br /><br />In the end, I'd say read this book and decide for yourself.  But in the meanwhile, I find myself hoping that Rothfuss gets himself more practice on creating characters that are actually compelling.

B001P7HUF0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I had to watch it for a class and I was not sure how I would like it when it was described to me but when I started to watch it I really enjoyed it. It has a good story line to it and the characters are great. I would recommend this movie to every one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love a good series and this one is an excellent read and a very imaginative post apocalyptic world.  You will rip through Book 1, which is actually a short story.  Thank goodness he wrote 4 more and may have more coming.  I dare not say more lest I become a spoiler. I see Ridley Scott is trying to get the film rights.<br /><br />Today (10/08/2012) the Omnibus Edition is offered for $1.99 from Pixel of Ink.  Go get it.  I was happy to pay $5.99.

B006LSZECO|5.0|A friend of mine said this book was a \\"page turner\\" and she was so right.  I was spending alot of time at the hospital after my significant other was in a serious car accident and I needed a book that would catch my interest from the start. I loved the convenience of quickly downloading the book to my Kindle and I was hooked from page one.  You'll love the twists the author incorporates throughout the book and how she intertwines humor with suspense.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  As soon as I finished \\"Gone Girl\\", I quickly downloaded another book by the same author, Gillian Flynn.  I love her style of writing.  I can't tell you how many books I've started to read and lost interest...but I couldn't wait to get back to reading this book to see what would happen next.  Part of me actually didn't want to finish it because I didn't want it to end.  I felt like I knew the characters because they were so well developed.  Read it for yourself and see if you agree.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|After slogging through the first  book in the century trilogy, I reluctantly purchased The Fall of Giants. To my delight, the book was much better than the first. There was more focus on the characters and less on the intricacies of battle. Riveting and thoroughly enjoyable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book in the series did NOT disappoint one bit.  I wanted to refresh my knowledge of Eva and Gideon so I reread book one before starting this.  I'd forgotten how wonderful the first book was!<br /><br />This book continued the journey Eva and Gideon started in book one: that of a love affair between two very damaged people.  There are times when I couldn't decide who was more messed up because both Eva and Gideon are dysfunctional because of horrible things that happened in their adolescent years.  I can't tell you how many times I wanted to wring their necks because of the seeming lack of communication they went through - well, mostly Gideon for his lack of communication and Eva for her being so needy (understandably so...but it got a little annoying at times).<br /><br />I'm happy to say that by the end of this second book; many questions have (at long last) been answered and Gideon was finally able to tell Eva what had happened to him that had caused him such horrendous nightmares.  Things look fairly good for Eva and Gideon to move ahead once again....and darned if Eva didn't tell Gideon that she was going to marry him!  I'm looking forward to the next book in this series.  Being privy to their love affair....just darn enthralling for this reader.  There's still plenty that they need to work through together and it'll be this readers priviledge to find out how they find that final nirvana.  I'm also hoping that Cary can find that one person who rocks his boat like Eva does for Gideon.  It'd just take that one special person and Cary would likely settle down himself (quit catting around!).<br /><br />Thank you for a fine book.  I'd recommend it highly but make sure to read the first book in this series first.

B0091XRL86|4.0|As with all Aardvark productions, the animation is superb - you would need to watch this film several times to catch every nuance, every gag. But whereas Pirates! is great family viewing, it is somehow less appealing to adults that Chicken Run or Wallace and Grommet. A couple of obvious gags were not fully exploited; having Darwin plagiarize \\"evolution\\" from the Pirate Captain was a distinct possibility, or having the Pirate Captain fall in love with the \\"obvious\\" female crew member... these are twists which would've registered more with adults and which simply failed to materialize. However it's still a very good film, beautifully made, very clever, funny and full of eye candy. Just don't get your hopes too high - it's basically a kid's movie front and center.
B003K15INU|3.0|This review is for the Kindle version.  Wow, lots of terrible OCR errors.  I don't know how many times I saw like 15 for is or words with extraneous spaces.  There was almost a mistake per page.  You can understand what you are reading, but for a great book like this you would expect them to proofread it a time or two.
